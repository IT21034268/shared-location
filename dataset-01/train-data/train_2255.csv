1,Beware,"Owners of Dell computers may not be able to load or listen to this recording without problems. Many Warner Brothers label discs (Teldec, Erato, Warner Classics, etc)have anti-piracy software that many Dell (and some Toshiba) disc drives cannot read without a large amount of background distortion. It isn't present on all, but is on many (I have over 25)."
5,The REAL ska!,"A great cd! This was my introduction to the first wave of ska (the real ska) some years ago and i still think is one of the best compilations i've heard. Great classics such as Lord Creator, the Techniques and Jimmy Cliff. It has some tracks you wont find anywhere else so BUY IT!!"
2,unmatched description,"Really poor description for ""very good"". The book looks very dirty and has been used at least 5 times before. This should be categorized into ""acceptable""."
4,condition,"the condition was a bit worse than i thought, but at least it came on time. The outside was kinda dirty, but inside pages was alright."
1,Don't buy this book from green leaves,"Do not purchase this book from third party seller ""green leaves"". I tried it because they use Amazon shipping. I paid for one day delivery. After 3 days I found out from Amazon help that the seller doesn't even have the book and Amazon is crediting my account. Great! Classes started yesterday and I am back to square one. And I can't even leave this feedback on the seller's page...This seller gets NO STARS but I had to give them one just to post this."
1,Not the same quality refill that came with the pen!,"I have a Paper Mate PhD pen which I absolutely love and found these refills on here for a great price, however I was NOT happy with the quality of the refill. It does not compare. I did also notice that the writing on the side of the refill was smudged and not the same as the refill that came with my pen. Is there a such thing as a ""knock off"" refill?!? I would not recommend this product. Very disappointing :-("
5,Great refill,"A nice refill for certain model Papermate pens, including the PhD but where is the RED A6 refill ? Papermate used to make them.."
1,wrong one,they sent the wrong type and never sent it to be returned end of story. don't use them.that is all
1,Warning doesn't fit PhD multi,"Well, I made the same mistake as another reviewer and got it for my PhD multi - the product is probably OK, but the description needs a bit of a warning on this."
3,"Interesting concept, but a little strange in its execution.","I love all kinds of music - from punk to classical.When I saw that a string quartet was covering Panic at the Disco's music, my interest was immediately piqued. The few samples I listened to amused me, and I bought it.While it's certainly innovative, it actually weirds me out a little bit to hear these familiar tunes played in such a different manner. I've only listened to the CD a few times since the purchase because of that.The quartet is very, it's just not quite my cup of tea."
4,Every Ducati in a single book,"Very well written; I have several books by Falloon and enjoy them all. Great pictures and interesting data. Some of the tables are a little hard to decipher, but with time and patience it can be done. I would recommend this book to any Ducatisti or Ducatista and any follower of Falloon. Great service from the Book Rack also."
4,Ducati Singles,"I have become recent fan of the early Ducati 250 single cylinder bikes, specifically the monza, diana, mach 1, daytonas, etc. This book has a reasonably thorough attempt describing these models over several pages. The whole book is layed out nicely, photos are great, and appears to be a great cross-section of the models. I cannot comment to the accuracy of the all the sections, but the singles section has a few different aspects than the Tom Bailey Ducati Singles book. It is likely due to the book taking on Ducati from the European view and less from the American Import perspective of Berliner. This book, along with Tom Baileys book will pretty much complete my library on the 250 singles. There are other books (out of print) but their prices when they are available are just way out of touch."
4,Smooth Pen,"I love the color green, its my favorite color. Thus I decided that My primary pen color would be green. With that being said, the pen has a smooth flow to it. It is Med point. It is a slender pen with a contoured tip for holding the pen. My only downfall it the color isn't 'dark' enough for my liking. I also have Papermate's Profile 1.4 pens in green and they are much darker."
5,favorite pen in the world,"Since I was little, I've always been writing or scribbling something. There's something about the green Paper Mate that can't be surpassed. I can't write as well with anything other than a Paper Mate (or at least it's something I tell myself) and while in my journals and at work I use black ink, I still have a love for this little green pen."
1,One of the worst pens ever,"I bought this box of pens to make the $25 free shipping requirement.However, I highly recommend that you purchase some other cheap box of pens or cheap item instead of this one.The ink will barely come out and the pen is extremely rough to use-- no glide action.The only positive thing was that the ink is the color green."
2,Disappointing,"For the most part, I found this book to be very disappointing. I had a hard time getting through the book and didn't really feel like I learned much of anything. I also feel that the title is very misleading. I bought this book expecting to learn about about walking in the Spirit/being led by the Spirit. But this book devotes only a single chapter to those subjects. Another concern I had about this book is that I felt it wasn't biblically based. My recommendation is to skip this book. A much better book on this subject is ""Grace Walk"" by Steve McVey"
4,three-fourths complete,"Surprised no one has yet mentioned that this is the best _of the first three albums_, not including new material from after Stevie left the band. The first 3 albums were the best, so this gives us a lot. Still, it would be unforgivable except that Rhino has released The Best Of Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes (1979-1981).The two CDs _combined_ give you everything."
5,finger poppin and soul searching in one,"FEEL GOOD MUSIC WITH A TRUE MEENING IN EACH SONG, MAKES YOU THINK OF YOUR BABY AND HOW SHE WOULD BE SO GOOD TO HAVE RIGHT NOW! HEY BABY I GOT THE FEVER."
2,depressing,"I enjoyed Shaman's Crossing, but the main character is quite dense and unlikeable in this second of the series. it's something you would read to initiate major depression. I was disappointed."
4,"likeable, realistic characters, exciting story","I am a newcomer to the Fantasy genre. I finished reading George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire and while waiting for the next book in the series happened on Shaman's Crossing by accident. I was immediately sucked into Nevarre's world and came to care about him, his friends and wanted the mystery of the Specks to unfold. I found Forest Mage to be a satisfying continuation of Nevarre's story. There are still many questions unanswered (as a mystery fan, I love that) and Nevarre is maturing into a truly flawed but real young man.I think, with the exception of Martin and Charlaine Harris' books I haven't looked forward to a sequel with this much anticipation in a very long time."
4,Continuijng to surprise,Again I was surprised that I enjoyed this book. I had read the reviews for the second book and was again cautiously pessimistic at what was to come. With that said I must say that I enjoyed this book just as much if not more then the first one. I enjoyed the pacing and story. My only criticism is that on the dream sequences the author is much too descriptive for my liking. Other then that I like the world she created and the characters as well. If you are a fantasy reader that loves to love the main character then this might not be the series for you. He is definitely the central character in the story however he is not an archetypical fantasy hero. He's kind of an uninteresting character thrown into an interesting situation. I find it entirely very interesting though. I think the author is at her best with this story. The story might not be as enticing as the Farseer Series but her writing is topnotch.
3,Middle book slows the story down.,"I loved the first book in the Soldier Son series an couldn't wait to get this one. I was disappointed. I'd say this book was mostly about setting up the rest of the series, but I found it mostly depressing and slow. Robin Hobb a master of the tragic hero though, so I'm sure he'll bring the series around!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This story has no redeeming value at all. The primary character is portrait as a Fat Slob who cannot do anything of significant. Not only is his life a waste, but this story is a waste. Do NOT buy it."
4,couldn't put it down,"I got very engrossed in this trilogy, the second and third books more than the first. However, I think its worth noting that for some readers these books may be triggering for body and eating issues.However, if you are okay to read books that discuss eating and body shame, forge on. The series is fascinating and unique."
1,What a complete waste of time... And I actually enjoyed the first one,"This has got to be one of the BIGGEST BORE I have read in many years. I actually have read her Farseer series and enjoyed it (til the end) and enjoyed the first one of the Soldier Son trilogy.But I agree with ""AKA - Diary of a Depressed Fat Man""'s review.This is absolutely one of the worst books I have read in ages and I tell you with all sincerely to skip it and pick up something else. I couldnt stand reading through it after 3/4 of the way in and just gave up. Not going to read the final book. It is that depressing.I started on Way of Kings instead and that is so much more satisfying."
2,AKA - Diary of a Depressed Fat Man,"I consider the `Assassins ` series one of the top ten fantasy series I've ever read, and I've read a lot. Therefore it was with keen interest that I picked up the `Forest Mage', especially after reading the first book `Shaman's Crossing'.This book should have been titled `Diary of a Depressed Fat Man'. Yes, I like complex character development - it's one of the reasons why the Assassins series was so good, but give me a break! I stayed up till 2:30am finishing this book, not because it was so captivating but because I couldn't believe it wouldn't somehow get better and justify the time I wasted reading it.Let me save you the time:He gets fat.Everyone hates him.He discovers that he has magic but doesn't know how to use it.He is still fat."
1,Nevare never does anything,"If you enjoy books about characters who have a million and one problems, but never seek out solutions for them, CONGRATULATIONS! Forest Mage just might be the book for you! Imagine a man who is slowly being overtaken by a controlling magic he does not want . Is being impinged upon by an unwanted personality who makes him do evilly evil things! Any other writer might make their main character fight their own fate. BUT NOT ROBIN HOBB! And we love her for it! And don't worry, even if Nevare seems to be making an attempt to turn his life around, take a deep breath and relax. Because he won't. He'll have sex with a Speck instead and then complain about it later."
3,"A strong effort, but haven't I read some of this before?","A gifted story-teller, Hobbs here rehashes some themes she's already explored elsewhere: unwanted or tabu magic that characters can't turn away from; physical transformations from human to something not quite human; well intentioned people who are unfairly misjudged by society and wrongly punished by authority. So on occasion parts of the book, if you're familiar with her other works, seem a bit too familiar. This can get in the way of what is a richly crafted and unique world and Hobb's solid, comfortable prose.A long shot better than most fantasy fare out there today, but frustrating because it seems to fall short of what it could be. She's good, and I'll keep reading her -- in the hope that she gets better."
3,"A Captivating Read, but a Little Diappointing","The story itself when looked at from a distance, was an excellent story to tell and could probably even be told outside of this trilogy; however, I felt it could have been reduced to a much smaller book. There are themes that repeat throughout this book. While they allow us to view the depth of the main character Nevare, I felt that these themes, such as Nevare's physical appearance and his appetite are simply mentioned too many times and in too great a detail.I was frustrated at times by Nevare's ignorance, but the story is told such that you still keep on reading long into the night, just to find out what will happen next.So, great story, just a little too lengthy and repetitive at times for me. I definitely prefer Hobbs' Assassin series so far."
1,"Tired, Tedious, Boring","I loved the Farseer series. It is in my top 5 of all time. This however, disappoints. It is boring, tedious, long winded and has a main character that is hard to like, not through any fault of his own. I did not like and unfortunately, will inspect all of Robin's works in the future more closely before buying."
5,Forest mage,"I love reading Robin Hobbs but MY GOD is she gut Wrenching! I love the outdoors and forests are a real treat for me. But after reading "" Forest Mage "" I wanted to buy a chainsaw and head for the nearest Redwood. What the main character in this book went through and all the people that died around him because of his curse was just terrible. Rarely does a fantasy book get so gritty. But that's what Robin does best. In a time when the bookshelves are loaded with mundane writers Robin shines. Can't wait for the next one."
3,Book 2 of a trilogy,"This was an interesting book, which like many 2nd books in a trilogy leaves a lot hanging. I will be glad to see the concluding book when it is published."
3,The book that is needed,"I loved the full Soldier Son trilogy. but this book was just to long and drove the story into the ground a bit as it transitioned from book 1 into book 3 it is needed to bring the story around and make it so you understand. It just became to groggy in all the information given to build the story. Its a must read if you have read the first book and enjoyed it because the third is even better then the first, but this one is needed to understand the greatness of questioned unanswered in the first and even the third book so you know whats going on with poor Nevare."
2,Disappointing writing from one of the greatest fantasy writers of all time,"After having written 9 of the greatest books of all time I can see how anything else she wrote would pale in comparison, but after struggling through the first book of this trilogy and looking forward to some substance I was disappointed. It was more ameteur romance and it took forever for anything to happen. Basically I read 700+ pages to really only get excited for the last 6. I will still read the last one though and I still love Robin Hobb."
2,Sobfest the second.,"I Love Robin Hobbs previous books, but this trilogy does nothing but dissapoint, sure the writing is still wonderful and Williams style is essentially unchanged. However the main character is just so unlikable. He is whiny, melodramatic and annoying. This made it really hard to get in to the book because you just don't care whats going on. All of the genuinely likable characters seem to throw themselves in the way of the often well deserved troubles of the protanginst. All in all the books well written imagary and well rounded characters just can't save this book from its protaginist."
2,Did not enjoy.,"Nevare was the least likable character in the book. Arthur W. Jordin, in comments to other reviewers, keeps telling people to become more familiar with western history, as if the world of Nevare is real. Get real Art! This is FANTASY. And not very good. I'll keep slogging in Renegade just to find out how it all ends but will probably just skim it. There were other more interesting characters in this book that could have been developed to make it a good read (Epiny, Yari). Actually, Nevare was portrayed as a poor stereotype of a female from some misogynist novel."
3,Why do you hate Protagonists?,"I love Robin Hobbs books, but I don't think she has EVER had one good thing happen to any of her protagonists. She is such a gifted writer, and I've read every book of hers, and they are so depressing. They are such good story lines, though! Great ideas, and you start to get to know the characters and like them, and then BAM!Please. Make one book that has something good happen to one person! I don't know why you hate people so much to have so much bad stuff happen to all your main characters. Just one, that's all. Have one person come out on top where you can feel good about reading the book."
4,Her characters suffer,"Hobb's tale casts the forest and human progress as antagonists. Neither are without sin. The peoples of the Forest and of the King suffer. But no one suffers more than Nevarre who is caught between the two worlds.In volume two Hobb abandons any pretense of a heroic main character turning him grotesquely fat, cutting him off from home, society, and all that could give him support.The pacing is slow but the telling is rich. Nevarre's slow understanding and acceptance of what is happening to him and his world is all the more believable for his not accepting the changes too easily, too quickly."
3,Anti-heros,"I dislike anti-hero's and the main character in this book is an anti-hero.Someone that doesn't have the common sense god gave an acorn, and whiny, the world is unfair. Can't stand it.On the other hand this was a very original story, good political undertones, in the tradition of using SF to make political statements about today. The ideology, the theme is very relevant.This is part of a series, and there is no resolution at the end, but it is left for the next book, and that drives me nuts."
1,absolutely awful,This had to be one of the most relentlessly miserable and depressing books I've read in a long time. Absolutely nothing good happens to anyone and it spirals into one disaster after another with nothing to redeem it or any of the characters. I'd strongly recommend avoiding it.
3,Corn Growing,Athough the story line is good this has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read!!! This author has a way of making it seem the story will take off any line now and it actually begins to several times just to fizzle out AGAIN and AGAIN; yet somehow I've managed to pick it back up after reading something else over & over again.Good story but corn growing can be more exciting at times.
5,"Amazing, read it ravenously","Amazing world, beautifully described and fast-flowing.. this book is one of the very few I have ever read twice, ranking with Ender's Game, Lord of the Rings and Orwell's 1984."
3,sigh...,"I had so hoped for a new series as great as the Farseer collection but was sorely disappointed. The vivid, forceful and emotionally involving characters, like Fitz and Nighteyes, do not exist in this book. Compared, Forest Mage and the other books in this trilogy are kind of boring. I hope that Robin Hobbs will go back to the Farseers, stories which provided some of the best reading of my life."
1,Enough with the FAT already!,"I greatly enjoyed other series by this author (e.g.the Farseer series). But this series has been a big disappointment. I thought the 1st book was OK, and hoped the Forest Mage would break free. However, this volume crashed and burned for me.I do not understand the author's equating obesity with magic. Maybe it will all come clear in the last book, but I won't read it so I won't know. It sure seems like she has some kind of obsession with weight....This book was hugely depressing and I cannot fathom how anyone can say they enjoyed this book. I lost interest in Nevare early on and the story just got darker and more depressing, as well as having many obscure plot moments (what was with the spinning top thing that somehow related to the Plains folk magic? Weird.)Once I find an author I enjoy, I generally trust them and buy future books without much thought. However, I'm afraid I will check the reviews very closely before I buy another one...."
2,Skip this one - should be 100 pages long...nothing happens,"You go into this book and you think a certain event is going to occur that moves the story along. You think it will happen in the first 100 pages, but, at the very worst by the end of this book.But here, it doesn't. Maybe this event will happen in book 3.Meanwhile, 500+ pages in which 400 of them serve no useful purpose in moving the storyline along. This is a Classic Filler middle book of a trilogy. It's not very exciting, not very interesting, not worth reading.This is sad, as when Megan Lindholm is on it, she rocks. She's not here."
5,Robin Hobb please call me!,I have read a lot of Robin Hobb & believe she has to be my perfect soul mate. The story of the Soldier's Son is compelling as usual. I really like her character development & believe that the individuals who gave marginal reviews of this book are simply not developed characters themselves yet (I'm still a work in progress too.) The philosophy of her main characters (the good guys) clearly illustrates the battles we all wage on the road to being good people & does so in an entertaining fashion. The bad guys are extremely frustrating & well constructed. Call me Robin!!!
4,Gay guys should read this too...,"I bought this for a female friend who doesn't know I'm gay after we debated whether someone else was or not. (She assumes that all effiminate men are gay and that all gay men are effiminate, - I had to laugh to myself as she said this and I butched myself up even more than normal!)The book has some annoying stereo-types, like all gay men are great dancers (I'm not), but since it's clearly tongue-in-cheek and a quick read, it's great for a few good chuckles to any one, gay, straight, male or female."
5,Best for women who are currently dating a gay man,"The best thing you can do with this book is to give this as a gift to a friend who is dating a gay man, and who thinks that she isn't.The best thing about this book is that it walks through the steps of a gay man/straight woman relationship, and talks about it from the woman's point of view. It has a section: ""What the woman is telling herself,"" that is very informative.I don't think there are any gay men who match up 100% to the checklist that this book ends up being, but like I said, I think that this book is more a tool for coping than for anything else.Technical stuff: This book is written in a comic book format--mostly pictures. I finished this book in about 10 minutes. It's pretty small, too. Only 80 pages.Overall, an excellent buy, especially since they are selling so cheap used on amazon now."
4,Great-functional PDA tool,"I have enjoyed the functionality and flexibility of this product, and highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates having a ""macgyver"" like piece of equipment!"
4,Paper Mate Multipurpose,"Pros:- Good balance for writing- Good grip- Smooth operation for writing with pen, pencil, and also as stylusCons:- Slightly oversized- Twisting action to change instrument does not lock well, particularly when selecting the ballpen"
3,Blue?,"I ordered a blue stylus. I got an orange one. So I thought, ""maybe it's blue ink.""It's black.Then I realized they meant that the actual pen was blue.I get it.Pretty useful pen for power palm users, but;I can't figure out how to open it, so when the pen runs out, am I supposed to throw it away? It came, unencumbered by packaging, mailed in 2 foot by 2 foot box. No instructions or refills or anything but an invoice from the shipper. (In other words, they mailed me a ballpoint pen in a HUGE box filled with bubble wrap!)I won't order office supplies on-line again."
4,Nice multi pen but....,"This is a nice multi pen. I keep it with my pda and it work s great. I hate having a bunch of pens in my bag so I bought two of these and they're all I need. A little hefty in the hand but it write with pen, pencil, or stylus with authority.The only problem with the pen is the pocket clip. It broke off within the first week. But hey, who clips their pen to their pocket these days anyway!"
3,"Please note, this stylus does NOT work with iPad","I was looking for a thin tip stylus for ipad and I bought this.Apparently it was my own fault that I should have checked when this product is designed: far before the iPad/iPhone were invented. So not surprisingly, this thing does not work with iPad."
1,NOT FOR IPAD,"This ""stylus"" is not for touch pad devices like Ipad. The stylus is hard plastic. Fine for older PDA devices that require a hard tap. Pen and pencil work fine. Just don't buy this if you want to sue it with any ""I-"" device."
4,Very Worthwhile,"I don't have much to add to the comments by the other reviewers. It's wonderful that these survivors have been given a chance to speak before they pass away.The stories are very moving and bring up a lot of emotions.Of the films, I thought ""Eyes of the Holocaust"" was a little heavy-handed. In one segment, the names of Hungarian children who died are put up on the screen, with their ages, but with live-action faces of contemporary, living children. Some of the children seem to glare at the camera, as if to convey the idea that the viewer is somehow responsible for what happened to these people. I hope this is not what the film-maker intended. I think that's carrying the ""Never Again"" idea a bit far.Just listening to the survivors tell their stories is the best part."
5,"A great value, very well made","We love these aluminum rings! They are really nicely made --very smooth, one-piece aluminum, so not only is there no worry about rusting or welds to corrode or break, but they are naturally quite non-stick. We have been using them to poach eggs in, and we don't even need to butter them. They are very light, good looking, and a very versatile size. These feel like an amazing bargain at the $10 we paid for them."
5,Very cute,These were perfect for my four year olds birthday. They looked great and I got lots of compliments on them. They were also so easy to make.
1,Misleading,"The title and description are entirely misleading. This is not your typical waltz. They teach a country style waltz. The moves look like country line dancing and waltz meshed together; it is laughable. The second video is very short and useless; it teaches about 5 moves. The first(primary) video teaches a lot of moves, but only 3 of them are worthy of being used in a real ballroom(as opposed to a country bar). The teacher is monotone. He also attempts to teach proper form; that attempt was so bad that I had to spend extra time to erase his instruction and re-establish my development prior to his ""assistance"". Most of the steps are nearly impossible to learn as his partners long dress is often blocking vision of his feet. I was very disappointed."
2,Meh.,"I have an OLD sewing machine. It has no bells or whistles. This ""Beginner's Guide"" seems to assume I have a newer machine, with capabilities my machine lacks. So all I can do is sew in a straight line and I was hoping for more of a reference book, something that would explain patterns and techniques. Instead, I got a lot of projects which I won't make and a little bit of semi-helpful information. The color is pretty, though."
2,Knot really good for beginner,"Im the one new beginner for sawing was buying this one for help me out but u can see most of the part still hard for beginner. They should show u as basic for easy sawing not as like in the book show u how to do pants ,vest or other"
2,These reviews are so off,"This book is good, but gives way to much information for the beginner sewer. Being a doer than a tell me and I'll figure it out somehow. I even contacted the Home Sewing Association and they verified that no book is backed by them. However, as I am already aware they suggested Elissa Meyrich's Sew Fast Sew Easy book."
1,A Waste of Money,"This is a horrible sewing book for a complete beginner. With the exception of explaining the mechanics of the sewing machine, this book covers very little on how to use a patterns, different fabrics, how to place a pattern on fabric or any of the elementary basics needed to sew anything. It is very much a waste on money, and I strongly urge those interested in learning how to sew either purchase a book like ""The Complete Guide to Sewing"" by Readers Digest or talk to your local fabric store about sewing classes. Do not buy this book; it has a lot of useless information for a beginner."
3,good but . . .,"Most of the reviews seem to suggest that this book contains all the information you will need to make the various projects--untrue. Yes, you delve into t-shirt making, after you buy a pattern. This book is helpful to me but I was under the impression the book contained these relatively simple patterns."
3,'projects' are DATED!,"First, this is yet another book that is great at descriptive information, and for the first 57 pages, I would rate it a solid 4.5 stars. The information is well written, and I found it very informative. That said, however, if you are looking for a book that can teach you the basics AND provide patterns - THIS IS NOT THE BOOK. The patterns are really awful (unless you like Alfred Dunner clothing or need to make nurses uniforms). The instructions for making the items are very well written, with lots of pictures to show the techniques, but unless you are looking to make a gift for your Grandmother, there is nothing worth making. The lack of attractive projects makes this yet another 'check it out from the library' book, and not a book to purchase."
4,Sewing 101,This is an excellent book for those new to sewing. I bought this copy for my daughter. It arrived in good time and in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again!
4,Excellent For Beginners,"This was one of the first sewing books I bought when I started sewing in Oct. 2008 and it's been my main guide ever since. In addition to techniques, it has simple projects one can do without a pattern such as a tablecloth and baby blanket that I've done and given away to rave reviews. Among the dozens and dozens of techniques, it covers mitered corners, cutting lengths and zippers - which I've found essential. I recommend it for sewers of all levels."
4,Best Sewing Book Yet,"If you're new to sewing or just want a refresher, pick up this book! I know how to thread a machine and sew a straight line but that's about it. This book covers so much more. There are even examples of up to date patterns that would be easy to sew such as a wrap around skirt, throw pillows and scrub pants.You will learn terminology used regularly in sewing, as well as all the basic skills that are the building blocks of the art. From threading the machine to sewing a straight stitch, to more complicated procedures such as installing zippers and following patterns, everything is covered. Each new technique is taught via the creation of an actual project."
3,More like sewing 201,"If you are a very beginner, this is not the book to get you started. I got very frustrated after reading this book and was ready to quit until I bought the book ""Sew Fast, Sew Easy."" It leads you step by step, which this book does not. I may use it as I learn more..."
1,I Still Cant Sew!!,"I really expected this book to break down the process of reading patterns, but it didnt. I still think that they look like really bad jiggsaw puzzles and I know no more than I did when I started. Oh wait, I know that I should IRON the fabric before I start working with it. THANKS!I dont know what Im going to do, I'm afraid to buy a bunch of books trying to figure out how to sew and where I live, classes are limited. I saw that there was a video, but it got some pretty poor reviews. My brand new machine is in the basement taking up space."
4,Good for beginner's,Easy to follow with big pictures. Easy projects. If you know how to sew this book is not for you. If you need to learn how to sew this book is perfect.
1,Worst sewing book EVER.,"This isn't a guide for beginning sewers. This is a guide for someone who has never heard of sewing and refuses to read their machine's manual. In the ""technical"" portion, it covers almost nothing not covered in your manual. The projects featured in the book all look exactly like things my grandma used to sew in the 80's. Elastic waist, pull on cotton (not knit!) pants!? Really!? This is the first book I have EVER returned to Amazon. It's that bad."
2,Not the most descriptive,"I must admit not all of my disappointments concerning the book are the authors fault rather a bad experience. I wanted a book with simple projects for a beginner. A lot of the projects were for the home and really don't need to be described in much detail. I was excited to try the nap-time tote, I thought it would be the perfect gift for a baby shower. The amount of fabric needed was written but not the amount of basting tape or the amount of the interfacing, which irked me a bit. After a bad experience with the ill-informed employees at Joann's I was ready to start on the project. After everything there wasn't enough fabric, which could totally be the fault of the incompetent Joann's employees, and not the books. This whole situation makes me glad that I didn't waste my money on this book.There are plenty of better project books. A lot of the good projects that are in the book can easily be found online for free."
4,"Pictures out of date, but nice format.","This was a gift for my daughter, which was given to her with a new sewing machine. It looks like she is learning a lot from the book and enjoys reading it."
3,"great inspiring book, but class probably needed","I purchased this book months ago, and I enjoy looking at it most nights. It inspires me. I still have not figured out how to make a T shirt, which is the first project, but I've made countless tutu's, a cape (barbie & three musketeer style) and am almost ready to take the plunge and cut out the pattern for the T shirt. What this book has taught me most of all, is that everyone starts somewhere. Hopefully by next Halloween I will have improved enough to make a real costume for my child, table linens and curtains. This book makes me want to be creative, its introduced me to a hobby I like, even though I appear to have no natural talent for it, it has given me an escape from my job as a trial attorney. Its wonderful."
5,GLORIA ES DIVINA!,"ME ENCANTO LOS ULTIMOS Y NUEVOS 5 TRACKS DEL CD. ME GUSTA ESPECIALMENTE ""EL INGRATO"", ESTA CANCION ESTA CHIDA."
3,...y que sufran con lo que yo gozo!,"OK... quiero aclarar algo, this 4 stars are not for the whole cd... they're just for the new songs.La neta, I think that the songs they chose for this cd are just wrong... awesome songs were left out...The live songs in La Trayectoria are OK, poor sound quality though, Univision could have done waaaay better than that... but oh well....On the new songs: They're really good, don't get me wrong I love them, but I think Gloria Trevi is trying way too hard to find herself again. In ""Todos Me Miran"" she sounds like Monica Naranjo; in ""Sufran Con Lo Que Yo Gozo"" like Ana Barbara; in ""El Secreto"" like Julieta Venegas... and I'm just saying music-wise if you pay close attention you'll get what I'm saying.... The lyrics are pure Gloria Trevi, but it's the sound in which she's trying to find her old self.... Good start though..."
3,Good for a live album,"I have never been a fan of live albums. I think Gloria did a good job with this one. Some songs are missing like ""Con los ojos cerrados"" and ""Tu angel de la guarda"". The new songs are nice, and the DVD is a great collection item."
4,Good desk pen,"What I like: (1) It has a comfortable grip, (2) it writes smoothly, and (3) it is aesthetically pleasing.What I don't like: (1) It is too thick to comfortably carry in a shirt or suit pocket, (2) sometimes the rubber grip does not fit the pen snugly and moves or bubbles slightly.I have a few of these, and mostly keep them at my desk."
5,very convenient,This bag looks nice and is very convenient. We are using it for toys for our baby. It is larger than I had imagined but I'm sure the size will come in handy as the toys inevitably accumulate. I like the pockets on the side - you can stuff small items in them.
5,Perfect Solution,"Tried a bunch of different whistles for on-ice. With other's, especially during game drills, I had to take my glove off to stop play. Sometimes this was too late to stop the kids where they were in order to correct them, or, if I needed to handle the puck and possible blow a play dead. This solves those problems. I put it on my top hand side and it works great."

3,Good for only two years...,"I mounted these seats on my 2009 Boston Whaler 130 Super Sport. They were great at first, and seemed to be well built. And for the most part they are. But... two years later the vinyl is cracked in many places and the seats always retain water internally. They're always ""squishy"" now, and your [...]gets soaked whether it's raining or not. The vinyl has become hard and brittle. [...]"
1,Defective Product,"This product did not work. Getting through to the company is a long and painful process and when you finally do they treat you rudely and talk to you like you're an idiot. I give this product zero stars and strongly recommend against anyone ever making the mistake of ordering from this company. Amazon, however, was great about helping with the return."
3,"Not a bad reference, but seems to cut corners","Is it just me, or are travel guides becoming smaller and smaller? I was surprised that a travel guide for a city that has some much to offer in dining, lodging, and attractions would be so brief. The information included is good, and has an excellent amount of detail. But I wonder if businesses have to pay to be included, as there were some notable establishments missing (such as Antoine's). It may just be an oversight, as there were also a few typographical and grammatical errors as well. Overall, this is an adequate guide, especially for someone that may be new to the Cresent City.BTW, don't go to New Orleans without going to Commander's Palace in the Garden District. It is the greatest restaurant in the city, and well worth the price of admission."
3,"Rev Brown - Psychomachia (Provogue, 1996)","This is a second of only two known recorded works of Birmingham, UK native Blues guitarist and singer Rev. Brown.Conditionally attributed to Blues Rock, this second work is more mature than debut one, expanding borders of the genre and exploring new still remaining within the boundaries of the genre. Rev. Brown's guitar technique and riffs are new and unique already, his playing is kind of mesmerizing, it is full of same furious and breakneck solos (""There's A Rumour Going Round"", ""Sunset On Time"", ""Sad Sad Day"") as well as simple and heartfelt acoustic fretting (""Come `Ere Babe"", ""Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)"", and his voice is softer and warmer; less despair is felt throughout the album, thus it could be defined as a happier Blues, which still is quite sad.Less attractive than the previous work but still much enjoyable.pastblues.com"
3,fits old papermate slim ball point pen perfectly,"howdy y'all,been hunting for refills for my twenty year old papermate slim ball point pen. this works perfectly. while not listed on the ""works with"" list, this item fits and works just spiffily.rated THREE cuz it does what it otta and no more.take care,lee"
5,Easy to Follow Basic Plot Structure,"Did you know that there were at least 10 different types of main story plot structures? Or that there were four types of ""City Symphony"" stories (plots about a place) such as ""event oriented?""After you learn these different types of plots and versions you can use them to construct your own plot shape. My favorites are the postmodern hero journey ensemble, Personal Anthology City Symphony or ""mockumentary tragedy."" Knowing what types of stories have what types of plot events and where in the timing makes writing much easier to plan. This class is good for expanding the way you tell stories at the most basic level. Essential."
4,Good Basic Pens,These pens are about as basic as they come. They serve their purpose and they write nice and smooth. They are definitely worth what you pay for them.
4,exceptionl experience,"for those who love adventure and traveling, this is an amazing history from an exceptional writer"
5,My favorite poet,Reading about Neruda's colorful and exciting life was a real treat. I fell in love with his poetry while studying Spanish language and culture in college. He's been my favorite ever since. Reading about his life helped me understand his poetry even more.A marvelous account of a man's life who contributed so much to Latin America and the world. I wish he were still alive....
5,You will really love this CD,What a beautiful CD this is - every track takes you on a deeper and deeper journey to relaxation and meditation. The flute playing is gorgeous. Also a great Tantric tool - yum!I highly recommend this CD.
2,Takes 2 full days before the water is clear,"I used this product on Sunday afternoon and the water was crystal clear by Tuesday night. I thought this product wasn't going to work, but the water cleared up just in time before I was going to give a double dose. If you want fast results this product isn't for you. I also noticed my fish started to act a little crazy as soon as I dropped the solution in the water."
2,very cheap,i bought this model for my little brother hoping he'd have fun making and playing with it but it falls apart and breaks very easily
3,frustrated potential buyer,Looks good for a project I need to make BUT...How Big Are They ?Come on ! Think Mr vendor - people need to know how big such mins are ![...]
5,Perfect for college-level collections strong in interior design history,"The third updated edition of A HISTORY OF INTERIOR DESIGN comes packed with the latest examples throughout and offers a synthesis of some 6,000 years of domestic and public interiors. Topics range from furniture and decoration to cave dwellings and temples, cathedrals and palaces, and provide a blend of architectural survey and political and social analysis to consider the extent of how interior style evolves. An accompanying CD-ROM with over 100 illustrations provides a timeline of this history. Perfect for college-level collections strong in interior design history."
5,nice book,It is an awesome book which has a lot of informations and pictures.The condition of the book is perfect.
5,Stepping Up in Grades Can Be Tough,"Third grade meant a new school and, of course, new classmates for my 9 year old grandson. Got him this book over the summer and he loved it."
1,Main character is a horrible role model!,"Throughout this book, Marsha, the main character, lies to friends and teachers, creates drama, warps the truth, displays vindictiveness, and all sorts of other negative attributes. The book character that Marsha loves and emulates is Scarlett O'Hara. Not exactly promising, huh? The reader is left to discern the truth of situations on their own since the story is told from Marsha's twisted point of view. Having a third grade child, I don't know how accurately he could do that. Even in the end, when she realizes that her actions have hurt many people, she does not directly apologize to Roger, the student she has hurt the most. I have been a children's librarian. There are tons of amazing books for children. If you are looking for inspirational characters for your child to admire, this is NOT the book for you!"
2,Not that good......not that bad....,I bought this movie after I read the description and I wish I wouldn't have. Some of the worst acting. Not believable at all.
2,Just ok...,The shipping took a long time because it took them close to a week to just process the order. The material of the litter pan is easy to clean for the positive aspect. Besides that it is just a regular litter pan that you could find anywhere else...
1,nightmarish jumble,"If you want to be confused, frustrated and bored, I highly recommend this title. Latarski obviously has little concept of how to teach these complex topics in a book format. The book is basically an unexplained JUMBLE of complex information with no snap, explanation or humor to the writing whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and buy Fretboard Logic or Mel Bay Understanding How to Build Guitar Chords & Arpeggios."
2,Good Reference but Poor for Teaching,"I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding tons of diagrams and fingering charts with little in the way of application or explanation.I bought this book from the recommendation of a teacher who taught just as confusingly as this book. After waisting much money on the teacher without much to show for it, the book became utterly useless. For the beginner in music theory, this book will only add to your confusion.The most useful beginner music theory books I've encountered are the grade school workbooks you may get for an 8th grade band student. I believe Alfred publishes these. That will give you a much better understanding of the basics at which point this book may become useful as a reference, but is far to boring for anything more."
1,I couldn't make hide nor hair of this book,"Maybe the guy's good, maybe not, but he can't communicate. All his books are is a juble. What Don needs is to go back to school to learn to communicate."
5,Engineer,"EXCELENT! Ive founded in this book a great guide of music theory for guitar players. This book is an excelent point to met the basic theory as intervals, chords, harmony, scale pattern and most important how you can implemets all of these topics to start to compose your own music."
4,It fit eventually,"Quality is good, but the instructions could have been a little bit better. In my car (93 geo prizm) I had to break off the top tabs and replace them with the almost-identical slide-in tabs (part gbp-955) in order for the bottom holes to line up. This wasn't mentioned in the instructions at all, and the one image where the tabs do appear, they are backwards. I also had to trim the tiny little tabs off the inside ends of the stereo hole to get the sleeve in. Once I figured everything out, it fit just fine and it seems pretty solid so far.The plastic also seems less brittle than the scosche kits I have used in the past."
1,You get what you pay for,"I got this dash kit because i was replacing my factory head unit with a sony xplod bt2700 in my 97 geo prizm. Since its an older car and i'm a broke college kid, i didnt want to spend a lot of money. The instructions are not clear at all, the quality is ridiculous, and it does not fit well at all. Thankfully my brother is quite proficient at installing car stereos. He was able to salvage it for me and made it work, but he had to do quite a bit of extra cutting and filing to make it all fit correctly. For the few extra dollars buy a name brand. You will not be sorry."
3,"Ok for the price, but expected more from the description","Overall the lamp is OK. I was disappointed to see that it was not actually made of wood, but painted to look like wood."
1,Very disappointing.,Contains very little information and only a few photographs of Whitney Houston. Mostly interviews with British music industry representatives and fans about their feelings regarding Houston's music and untimely death. Includes a number of songs written by fans in tribute to Houston. Not at all what the promotional information I read online or on the DVD liner itself lead me to believe I'd be watching.
5,Leatherman Lover,Bought this as a gift for my dad. Will probably buy another for myself sometime. They make quality products.
5,Great product,"I've bought several over the years (due to wearing them out or I misused them) and they always perform. I've tried a couple of look-a-likes, but they just didn't have the quality of this product. Highly recommend!"
4,small an mighty,I gave these to my son and husband for christmas and they loved them. just the right size to carry around.
3,micra,"somewhat useful item i received as a gift.PROS:~very well built and sturdy to use.~scissors are crazy strong, i have used them more than once to cut electric bass guitar strings in an emergency, this did knick up the blades a bit but a little file and stone work and they are good as new.~knife blade can take a good edge and seems to hold it for a while..~nice file, actually usable unlike most files like this.CONS:~tweezers are useless or i dont know how to use them.~no can opener??? what? come on u gotta have a can opener on something like this.~seems really heavy for such a small knife...they should make a Ti one maybe."
1,Very unfair product description,"This tool is great. However, I feel that the product description by Amazon is at best confusing. You must go to the fourth photograph and read the small print before you learn that the clamshell presentation pack with the maglight is not the item being sold. The last photograph of the box is the one you're getting. The clamshell pack is a seperate item."
4,Micra Multi-Tool is a Winner,"Good size, worth the price. I have only had it a few weeks so I stumble on selecting different elements or blades until I get used to how it is configured. I would definitely recommend it to a friend as a general, handy do-it-all light duty pocket tool."
4,Micra Multi Leatherman 1,"This is a great product; pocket size so it's easy to carry every day. It was a gift to my husband to replace the one he lost. It has a few differences from his old one, but it does come in handy -- every day."
5,Leatherman Micra Outstanding pocket tool,Leatherman 64010101K Micra Multi-toolThis pocket tool is so much more than a handy knife. It is easy to carry and handles many tasks. The workmanship is comparable to the full sized Leatherman tool I have owned for many years.
5,Under-rated tool,"As an NCO, much less a Soldier in general, I find this tool invaluable in day to day affairs. The scissors are fantastically functional as are the assortment of tools for random uses. You never realize how much you use it till you don't have it. I was sorely disappointed at how much I missed the tools on the Micra when I switched over to the new mini-leatherman tools that employ the quick clips."
5,Baby Shower Gift,Weird enough I had a friend give this to me for a baby shower gift. It has everything you need to keep around while taking care of a baby. I now continue to give it away as gifts like that as he gave me. Its excellent quality and has a lot of utility.
4,Great little product...,High quality...albiet small...seems expensive for size...great little tool....wish I had bought the larger one...it was a thoughful gift for a friend....
5,Happy Leatherman,Received this product and got a pouch with it that I didn't expect. Replaces one I donated to the airport security in Phonix. Love the mini-leatherman it is very convient.
5,A great pocket knife,This is a pocket knife that can solve most little tool jobs. I have had several pocket knives through the years but this on has been the best. I just lost this knife while going through airport security (forgot to pack it in my checked suitcase) so had to quickly order this one. It was nice to have it delivered so quickly.
4,Awesome,Solid little multi-tool. The scissors are sharp and it doesn't come with any of the useless tools that a lot of other multi-tools come with.I got it for the girlfriend for X-Mas and she loves it!
3,useful product,"thought the item was larger than depicted---arrived quickly though. The recipient liked it though. Great for a glovebox or handbag--as long as your not going to the ""airport!"" LOL durable."
5,Leatherman Micra Multi-tool,"Great tool - I have lost several, and given up a few at the airport after forgetting to pack them in my luggage, and always get another. I find these incredibly useful, and easy to carry around in my pocket. I has just the right tools for many needs that just pop up wherever I am.Also shipping was very quick!"
5,Great little pocket tool,This is a wonderful little pocket device with many useful features in a small package. Just don't forget and take it with you to the airport.
4,Good sunscreen,"This is a really good sunscreen and moisturer. I don't need a lot to last for a whole day. I live in a very dry climate. However, I don't like the applicator. I prefer the tube applicator I used from the sample at my dermatologist's office."
5,Interesting approach !,"Glenn Gould was always an outsider in every work he played . This position has its risks . Sometimes , (mostly of them) it worked out .In this particular case , we must to recognize first at all. that Hindemith piano music is built on wide cromatic lines hold by violent armonies and fierce counterpoints . And Gould handled this technique as the Gods . From here his succesful result.In the third sonate , however I miss the nostalgic eloquence given for Paul Badura Skoda in an old vynil recording from the fifties. I think Mr. Gould lacks a certain level of expresiveness , seeking a striking effect .However in the First Sonata , Gould plays with powerful conviction , giving a fresh reading and deeply idiomatism.The Second Sonata, probably is the jewel of the crown . The staccatos are played with clearness . And the whole conception of this work is perfectly translated.This is another example of the briliiant craft of this extraordinary artist."
4,good if you like hindemith and gould,"Quite an impressive display by Gould. These sonatas are rather cold and abrasive on their own, and Gould's precise and nearly machine-like playing only exaggerate this. I'm not sure if this would constitue more or less authentic playing, but it would probably turn some people off.. (if you like romantic piano, this probably isn't the CD for you) On the other hand, there is something particularly exciting and intriguing about Gould's cerebral style, and it is at top form on these recordings.If you're interested in listening to Glenn Gould, you should definately start with his Bach recordings, particularly Goldberg Variations. Of course, if you're looking at this, you most likely are very familiar with that recording (and the later one made towards the end of his life..)A must-have for Gould fanatics. Hindemithians may want to look elsewhere for their piano sonatas."
5,Even Better,"I like this book even better than I liked the first one. Its organization of color into two large chapters, ""Aspects of Color"" and ""Basic Color Schemes"" is very informative and can be used for anything involving color: wall paint, furniture, clothing combinations, paper, you-name-it. I was a tiny bit overwhelmed by all the information inside the first book and had difficulty focusing on any particular aspect of color. With this book, I simply find the aspects I like and proceed from there."
3,"Lots of color, but so so guidelines","Lots of color samples, but only so,so guidelines for effective use."
1,An insult to any but the color-blind.,"This book seems to be for ""color"" ......... Color Harmony 2 is an absurdly shallow and garish overview of one of the most sacred realms in art (and the human sensory experience): color. The author has the arrogance to make ridiculous statements about color--""rules"" that we are expected to believe without context or proof. Consider these quotes, ""Color combinations using yellow-orange or amber are the most welcoming."" What??? And, ""Elegant color combinations use only the palest tints"" (a statement too absurd for comment). This is a heartless book. Look elsewhere for inspiration!"
1,NOT about bodypainting,"I bought this book thinking it was about bodypainting - the design, process, and results - of a relatively new visual art form. Don't buy this book if you are interested in the art form itself. This book is actually a collection of poems, and only one poem is about bodypainting. The poems are the author's ruminations about how she views life as a single woman. As far as poetry goes, it does not appeal to me, but I do not doubt the author's sincerity."
1,Deception!,"This book has nothing to do with the art of body painting, except for it's cover. It is a book of poetry and it is misleading to advertise this book with those who treat the subject of body painting."
3,"Okay, but ultimately dissapointing","Thyis CD isn't horrible, but it certainly isn't the Less than Jake I'm used to. This CD feels like Alternative rather than Ska. The guitar isn't near as catchy as it was in either ""Pez Core"", ""Losing Streak"" or ""Hello Rockview"". In fact, when I first listened to this CD, I had to ask myself what made this CD ska at all. The horns have also been reduced to much weaker sound. Rather than filling the body of the CD they sort of ""accompany"" everything else, and are absent in many of the songs. Perhaps my expectations for LTJ were too high, but even so, in terms of ska, this CD really doesn't cut it. It does have some catchy tunes, no question about it, but if you are looking for a ska CD, you sould save your money and look elsewhere. This CD was written on tour through loads of coffee booze and whatever else LTJ was doing at the time, and it really shows in the end product."
1,Save your money,I noticed quite early in reading this that the stories were contrived. As someone else mentioned in another review this book reads totally unlike ANY war memoirs I have ever read. It seems to be simply a disjointed and poorly written collection of fictional scenes to make the point that war is bad and Germans did lots of bad things to the innocent Russian people. That's fine as far as it goes but it shouldn't be passed off as a non-fiction book about WWII.
5,An Insight into Hell,I was gripped by this honest and brutal account of the horror of war. Should we be shocked that a German 'grunt' might show compassion? Must all have been raving SS loonies? I too was reminded of The Forgotten Soldier. I commend this book to any WW2 scholar.
1,To Hell with this,"Dreadful. It is almost a wonder Mittlemann fought for Germany and wound up living in England and not the Soviet Union, for there is no mistaking his sympathies are with Marx and Lenin. Too often the book is punctuated with long speeches given by soulful Soviets on the merits of Bolshevism, all of which seems dated and silly in today's light. It certainly raises the question when this book was written, because few if any today would be caught singing the praises of the corrupt and inept politburo. Curiously as well, there is little fellowship that Mittlemann feels to the men of his unit, which is atypical for those who walked in harm's way. To Mittlemann the Wehrmacht stumbles and bumbles its away to annihilation, and it is only through his cunning and luck that he manages to make it through. Oddly the reader is left with no feelings for him. Like Hans Schmidt's SS Panzergrenadier, this is a frivolous polemic masking as a memoir"
1,Not recommended,"I totally agree with the reviewers who question the authenticity of this book, or at least the motives behind it. The more I read the more I wondered why this author seems to have had no friends, no positive experiences in his unit. It seems that all his sympathy was for Russians, patisans or soldiers. Strangely, he mentions supposedly friends of him dying in a passing cold way, while each russian person he meets is given 2 pages in which he/she can give lectures on communism."
5,Great Book by a Marvelous Author,Fabulous condition. Highlys satified. Well packed for shipment. This book brings the presence of the Risen Lord to the reader viz this world's current conditon.
4,A star is born,"I bought this for my year old daughter, she thinks its the coolest thing having a star named after her. The cat is on the small side but she loves it just the same. She enjoys going to the website and interacting with her pet. A really cute idea."
3,Is this a cat or a bear?,"My daughter is in love with this animal. She requested it for Christmas, but we don't know how she found out about this series of stuffed animals. The problem with it is that it looks like a bear more so than a cat (my daughter is cat crazy). She does not mind but does get tired of people referring to her ""bear"". It would seem the manufacturer found it acceptable to put a bear head on a cat body. Otherwise, the toy seems to be reasonably well made and is durable."
3,Bridget's Review,"I prefer red pens when I'm making corrections, so I asked for Paper Mate Stick Ballpoint Pens in red. I'm glad I did because I have gone through a lot of paperwork trying to get myself more organized and these pens came in handy. The ink smeared a few times and it there were times I had to go over some of my writing but other than that, they're good pens."
4,One of the best country singers,"Although I wore out my copy of ""Luxury Liner"" back in the 70's I found Harris albums a hit and miss experience. She can sing a great song like ""Boulder To Birmingham"" and then sing some mediocre version of one song too many.I think that the main problem of this anthology is that it is a collection of hit singles, every song comes with the highest place it charted. Some of the songs aged well, but as hits go by the fact that they were number 23 in the country charts don't make them classics. That's why we get Townes Van Zandt ""If I needed You"" a great song but not a very good version, and we don't get ""Pancho and Lefty"", that's why ""Evangeline"" and others are not included while some mediocre songs are.Anyway I just wanted one dbl Harris CD in my collection (I keep some LP's still, maybe I should listen to them from time to time) and I think this will do. She is one of the greatest singers in country music and a very beautiful lady too."
4,Love it,"Love this DVD writer. Biggest bang for your buck. Picked it up on special at Amazon for 83.59. One of the fastest dual layer external writers I have seen. 16X for single layer, took about 7-8 minutes to burn approx 4.6GB of data backup.LaCie is one of the better-known brands in the league of Pioneer (original champion of DVD writer) and HP.This model not only supports DVD-R/RW but also +R/RW, not to mention dual layer for both -R and +R.Recommended to couple of my friends and they too are very pleased with its performance.(...)Gave 4 stars as it only has USB connectivity; if only it also had firewire connectivity (but then the price would have been higher)."
2,Okay - not great.,"Pedrini Wine & Bar Plated Champagne Stopper, Chromeworks better than some but does not keep champagne from losing its fizz. I much prefer theMetrokane Velvet Champagne & Wine Sealer. It does a wonderful job of keeping champagne fresh for days."
1,The most inefficient learning possible,"This subject doesn't need to be hard, but this book makes it as hard as possible. It makes the student hunt for the needed information to work the practice problems. This makes the time spent doing homework very nonproductive. One may attempt to justify this approach as forcing the student to developed problem solving skills. This argument is just bunk! The best way to teach problem solving skills is to give the student as many tools as possible and then giving them the chance to practice. This technique is well proven. That's why it's used for all math classes up through differential equation and linear algebra. If math texts were written like this book, very few people would get through algebra let alone anything more advanced. If your instructor is good, you should be OK, but if you need to rely on the book, you're if for a miserable experience!"
2,"It's The Firmware, Stupid...","It's nice to have 3 discs in the machine at once, but this machine has very limited programming options, the remote control IR emitter is weak, and I frequently get the universal ""NO"" symbol (a red circle with a red line through it) whenever I try to do *anything*. This is the first DVD player I've bought, so maybe they are all like this, but I hope not. My recommendation is to either spend the extra four or five hundred and get a 200 dvd changer jukebox, or spend the price of this model on a high-end 1-dvd player that has more useful features."
5,"very good drill ""spade"" bits",I have used these many times since I received them and they work great. There seems to be just enough choices in size to fullfill my needs.
5,Makes you want a drink,Brian Doyle is a treasure. To say his writing drives you to drink is beside the point. Get out the cork screw and start reading.
2,Disconnected Writing,"I am a big Pinot Noir fan, especially from Oregon. So I had high hopes for this book, but after reading the first 4 or 5 chapters, I really lost interest. I felt like the writing was disconnected and didn't flow. I couldn't stay in the story, if you could call it a story. Glad I checked it out from the library."
4,Heavy stand.,This stand is heavy. I bought one for each of my children. The only gripe I have is that it is Made in China and not the USA.
1,Total rip off from Bluecell power,"I recently purchase a 20 pack of Cat5 couplers (RJ45f/rj45f) new. The first 3 I tried to use fell apart where the halves go together.At this point I dont feel comfortable using them. Please Advise on return or replacement procedure.Here is their reply:Hello friend,Thank you for your purchase in our shop, we are sorry for the product's problem.As our products are all FBA (fulfilled by Amazon), we suggest you to contact Amazon for a full refund.We are here to apologize for all the inconvenience caused by this issue. We promise we will strive to improve it now and in the future.Best Regards,BluecellAmazon says they are not returnable for what ever reason."
2,"Ugly color, but they work fine.","These turned out to be an ugly beige color, rather than the advertised white. Maybe I missed some fine print somewhere. They function fine, they just look like they came out of the 90s."
4,"They're Fine. But What is ""They""?","At a buck a piece, the price is excellent. I've only used a few, but they seem 100% fine.The bag of 20 came with no branding or labeling, so with various suppliers on amazon, how do you know if you're getting the same product other reviewers did? That's my only gripe. (Mine were beige colored. Sold by Ultra Spec Cables.)"
2,This sucks,I took a chance with ordering this CD as it was an item that popped up in a search I did for a completely unrelated other item. Long story short: this album sucks.
4,Digital Concepts (Sakar) CRV3 digital camera battery charger,"I originally bought this at WalMart's about 1 1/2 yrs. ago after my original battery that came with my Olympus camera finally died (it lasted about two years!). I only paid $20 for it at the time, now they don't seem to handle it. It works well, fast, and seems to keep a charge fairly well."
2,glorified EP - TMBG can do better,"This is essentially a They Might Be Giants EP with really fancy liner notes. One of our biggest disappointments was the title song. We have hadNo!for a while and the raucous ""Bed Bed Bed"" is one of our children's favorite ""go to sleep"" songs. The one here is a gentle lullaby, and lacks the musical irony of the original. The remainder of the songs have some of TMBG's quirky sense of humor.The book was also somewhat of a disappointment. The ""stories"" are merely the illustrated lyrics to the songs. Some of the illustrations are entertaining, but as a stand-alone book it is rather week. The songs are not very 'sing-along'able, and the stories themselves read as the lyrics of songs rather than stories. When read with the CD, the pacing is out of kilter. Some songs have a ton of words on a few pages, while with others, we found ourselves turning the pages rapidly just to keep up with the songs."
4,Good Good Good!,"My latest purchase is Bed, Bed, Bed, a children's book by one of my favorite bands, They Might Be Giants. It's a great book, with an accompanying four song CD of music designed to help children fall asleep. This project came to fruition after the amazing success of TMBG's children's CD NO! Check them out, you will not be disappointed, they offer so many free mp3s and they even have a clock radio for your computer which has three different stations of streaming TMBG music!"
4,It is nice.,I much prefer this version of Bed Bed Bed to their version on the Children's song CD. The songs are nice and my boys who are 2 and 4 enjoy them. Illustrations are nice.
4,"Song with this book better than on ""No""","We liked this version of the Going to Bed song better than on the original ""No"" album. The illustrations were more adult-friendly than child-friendly."
4,Great review of H.S. math,This book is a great review of H.S. math. But be warned a lot of the practice problems are more complex than you would normally find in an elementary math book. This book was published in 1918. Of course Amazon sent me a brand new printed copy. 4 stars!
4,Nice casual shoes,"Hard to complain about these shoes. They've held up to urban walking in wind and rain, and they look as good as the day I bought them."
5,wonderful children's book about confidence and bravery,"This would be an excellent gift to any young child; the story is inspiring and fun, and the artwork is terrific and detailed."
5,Great Mystery Novel,"I had downloaded ""Raven is Down"" to my Kindle which is a sequel to ""The Referee."" The Referee is not on Kindle which was a disappointment because I need the larger print to read comfortably. Fortunately, Dr Kirvin is my orthopedic surgeon who recently did shoulder surgery on me. He is an excellent surgeon as well as an author. I already had started reading ""Raven is Down"" when Dr. Kirvin gave me a copy of ""The Referee."" I was able to read it in a week for my eyes get tired. I just finished it and it was magnificent. Now I can go back and finish reading ""Raven is Down."" I can't wait for his next novel.Believe me, once you start reading, you will not want to put the book down."
3,Thought it was going to be better,Very disapointed with the movie. I had seen the twins on jeff probst show andreally wanted to see it. that is why i bought it.
5,Amazing and touching!,"What an inspirational story! And an enjoyable film. Of course, Leslie Jordan steals the scene he is in as always. A must watch and must have!"
2,"beautiful, alas not for children","we had a hard time finding stylish, children sized table ware. my son, now 2, is too big for the rubberized baby spoons. we have been letting him try using our salad fork and table spoon, but they are just a little too unwieldy for him.so when we found these, that fit within our aesthetic parameters, and we called ""children's flatware"" we were very excited. upon arrival, i was not disapoinnted in the craftsmanship -- however the size was unbelievable.the fork is as big, and heavier than our flatware. same for the large spoon. the small spoon has a good laddle size for little mouths, but the handle is designed for an adult to feed a baby -- as in it is too long for a child to manipulate.finally, the price is out of line for a product that doesn't meet basic functional criteria.we returned this product.other sets one might consider (we haven't see any of these in person):bsf filou -- expensive, but nicely designedoneida revereoneida accent"
2,Disappointing story that's doomed by information overload,"First of all, let me state for the record that I generally love any and all of Robert Doherty's works. I've read all of the Area 51 books and found them to be imaginative and believable enough to appear to be somewhat based in fact.Sadly, I didn't find much to make ""Psychic Warrior"" a book I would recommend to Doherty's fans.While the style of writing was Doherty's usual clear and consise manner, ""Psychic Warrior"" was dragged down by TOO MUCH information and not enough story! Doherty decided to spend the bulk of his story decribing how the psychic warriors were chosen, trained, and deployed and not enough time developing the plot. Doherty did a good job researching and creating the concept (in this case, soldiers who can use their minds to wage war), but the plot borders too much on the fantastic.Here's hoping that the sequel to ""Psychic Warrior"" takes off early with a great plot and saves this series!"
4,Just the beginning of a classic...,"This show is one of those totally surprising behind the scenes ones that no one would have expected to make it big. Lol ok it didnt really make it big but it really is one of those series that just gets better and better as time goes by. Though not initially intended as a comedy it is a truly hilarious experience as it gives a nostalgic slightly overdone and pseudo-semi-realistic portrayal of Trini-life. Liming, commess, ah set ah bacchanal not to mention macos everywhere!!!...Can't wait for the later seasons to see the ""where is Mr. Du Soleil"" storyline. All in all a true trini cyah go wrong getting this set."
3,QUEEN AND COUNTRY (2 tape set),"I was so thrilled to get this set today as I have a real interest in royalty, especially Queen Elizabeth. However, even though it says VHS on the back of the pretty tape holder, it is in PAL format and won't play on American VCRs. (I tried)- Very disappointing. It looks like a wonderful series and I would still like to see it. You shoulw love it, if you have the capability of playing this BBC tape set from the U.K. Good luck to you!"
4,BEST OF HUTSON'S EARLY BOOKS,"Shaun Hutson hasn't written a horror novel for quite some time, maybe fatherhood's mellowed him a bit, but this rates as the best of his early books. It reads like a b-grade pulp horror, but as usual Hutson has done his homework and doesn't spare his readers the grisly details,with issues ranging from torture and mutilation to infanticide one would expect his work to be garbage,. Fortunately he is a very good writer with a good sense of pacing. If you haven't read Shaun Hutson before this is a good place to start."
3,Morbid entertainment,"A nice story about psychic aborted foetuses that come back to life and feed on blood. Morbid subject matter, handled skillfully and entertainingly.Unfortunately, the character development is rather light and the twist at the end was extremely predictable. A little more work on that side of things, and it could have been a classic. Apart from that, its worth reading if you're looking for something gruesome."
1,trivializes genocide,"It matters not how well written this novel may be, for it actively trivializes the single most egregious ongoing genocide in the world today, that of the infants. Shame on Shaun Hutson; and all moral shopper will avoid this product."
3,Cheaply made but fun and sexy,"I bought this costume to cosplay when me and some friends went and saw 'Wicked!', the musical.The costume itself seemed to fit ok except the sleeves were tiny and I couldn't fit my arms through them! Mind you, I do NOT have huge biceps or anything so it was quite odd. I had to have a gf help me clip and resew the sleeves but once we did that, the costume worked out pretty well.The zipper was cheaply made (kind of expected) however so be careful zipping it up and down.The sequins get everywhere but it's a pretty fun and sexy costume =)"
5,I will read this one again..........,"The book was very well organized and thought out. I could relate to many parts and I knew by the end of the book that I would be opening it again for ""re-inforcement""."
5,Great pens!,"These happen to be great pens. They're very comfortable to write with, the ink doesn't smudge or fade, and they write quite smoothly. In fact, I've never used a disposable pen that writes this smoothly and effortlessly. Also, it's worth noting that I've been buying these in bulk for nearly 2 years now, and I've never had a single pen leak or ""explode"".Edit: By the way, I personally find the uni-ball Roller Grip Fine Point Roller Ball Pens with blue ink to be better than the black ink versionsuni-ball Roller Grip Fine Point Roller Ball Pens, 12 Black Ink Pens(60708). To clarify, the black ink version of the pen isn't bad. In my opinion, it just doesn't write as smoothly and effortlessly as the blue ink version."
3,"too thick, not fine point","I found many positive reviews of the fine point roller ball pens and bought it. But it is too thick, and not suitable to write an assignment or exam papers."
3,Fun group but limited,"I got turned on to the Hoosier Hot Shots when I heard their version of ""Breezin' along with the breeze."" It is a novel take on that oldie. I also saw a few videos of them performing and they were visually as playful as their music sounded. Here's the problem: they had some good ideas (slide whistle, hot rhythm guitar, good harmonies) but they only had a few good ideas and they used the same instrumentations in song after song after song with little variation. You really only need one Hoosier Hot Shots album in your collection - four is too much of the same old same old. By the time this box set was finished, I never wanted to hear them again. Too much of the same formula.A great group of midwestern guys, I'm sure. But I have had enough slide whistle to last me a while."
4,Great Music from A Time Long Past,"This is a great collection of wonderful music by a group that was preeminent in the 1920s and 1930s. What most reviewers miss saying is that this group was an early jazz-swing group and the clarinet work is astounding. Some of it is hokey or corny, some of it is repetitious, but a great deal of the music is simply joyful and swings like any of the big bands that followed. The only possible downside is that this is a package of four separate records, reproduced on four CD's, and some of the songs are repeated from CD to CD. But unless you are listening to all four of these sequentially, you won't notice. If you are looking for feel-good music and want to know what swing was like in its earliest years, this is a great buy."
5,Excellent Resource,"I have been trying to learn German for some time. I've used several books, but I've found that this is the one I can actually sit down and work with. It provides connected, conversational text in German. I can practice translation to or from English with it. Each lesson provides an extensive vocabulary. At the back of the book is a detailed grammar, and each lesson makes reference to different sections of the grammar. However, it does not force the grammar into the text. When used in conjunction with the available cassettes, I've found this to be faster and more fun than any other German book I've used."
1,"PLEASE DON""T BUY","Most songs are signed by confused children. They are in small groups and each one has a different style. Sometimes, they barely know the words.This is not for instruction. We Sign Rhymes, however, is a great instructional video."
1,Credibility = 1,"The Title should be ""From Hot Springs, Arkansas to Leavenworth"" how I applied the lessons learned as a child from con games, gambling, drug dealing and prostitution to politics and was able to charm most of the people most of the time as a politician but ended up with childhood friends in Federal Prison"
1,"Bill: liar, draft dodger, amoral, our Prez ... unbelievable.",Making an appointment for the ICU ward the nightI read this one ...
2,Clinton has done nothing extraordinary,"Even though we in America have peace and a booming economy, Bill Clinton does not deserve all the credit as many want to give him. A truly great president leads in times of struggle and disarray. Before George Bush was considered the worst president ever by so many, he had fantastic approval ratings because he earned them. He also led us through a war and a recession. But many would just claim he was the cause for these problems. Bill Clinton just inherited peacetime and an improving economy and considers himself to be a wonderful president. Its a shame he will be remembered by so many as a great president who supposedly brought on peace and a healthy economy when it really was the work of so many decent, moral Americans."
1,PHEW...stinks,"This book by the sleaziest president in American history stunck up my house. I am so gald that I borrowed it and didn't give a penny to him in royalties. If you WASTE your time with the lies, half-truths and selfagrandizing contained in these pages...run yourself a hot shower to feel clean. This man is why I am now a rapid Republican."
2,Shoddy quality volleyball from Tachikara,"The volleyball is of poor quality. The panels are assembled poorly and in some cases, there is overlap and small gaps. The volleyball is still sufficient for recreational play but if I saw it in a store, I would not have bought it."
3,Tachikara SV5WI,"I like the ball. It has a good feel, and travels fast when hit. The only problem is that I can't get others to play with it. They say it seems hard and sounds ""funny"". Another complaint from other players is that it hurts more than other balls when passed and is harder to control. For that reason it mostly sits idle waiting for the right players."
1,Not what expected,"I would give this book 1/2 of a star or a 1/4 of a single star... One customer's review said she ""laughed till her sides hurt"" which is why I bought the book. I for one did NOT laugh at the book, it really wasn't even funny. The stories are VERY dry and dated. I am 40 pages into the book and its awful. I can't believe the copy write is 1997 because the stories all seem to come from the 1930's and 50's. What was the author thinking? Couldn't she find some 80's or 90's women to share their child birthing stories? I couldn't at all relate to the women in the book. Very disapointing read, save your money on this one and put it towards your baby's nursery room. If your interested in a better book I highly recommend, ""From Here to Maternity"" by Allan Zullo with John McGran, very funny outrageous but true pregnancy stories."
2,Not a favorite,"The songs are not quality and themes shallow, but the video played great! We probably will choose another video next time!"
3,Some of them didn't work,"I love these pens, but half of the box of 12 didn't work when I received it. Maybe it was just a faulty box, but these would be 5 star pens for sure if they all worked."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic book for toddlers. It boasts great illustrations and words that sound fun, yet which aren't silly or Seuss-y. I picked up a copy at the libary for my 1 year old last year and as autumn approached this season had to have a copy to call our own."
2,Factual error distracts from fun,"This is a wonderful, colorful, fun read.Sadly, I can't recommend it, since it bizarrely, in the middle of listing things that are clearly and specifically autumn, has birds building nests (and the nest is even depicted with eggs in it). Um? Eggs are laid in spring, and birds build nests only for eggs. (Squirrels make leaf nests to keep warm in. That would have done nicely on that page.)Our children deserve better. They are cut off from nature enough as it is."
4,Important history not learned in school,"An excellent book, well researched ... but not very well written. Perhaps the reader needs more of a background in WWII and the various and sundry characters in order to follow them around (there are so many!); while I am more interested in the facts. And someone needs to tell this author that there is no such word as ""ironical"". How that got past editors and publishers I will never know!Still, this book is important history for understanding the roots of why our government is so out of control today -- it started then. It continues and will remain until we, as citizens, begin to take some responsibility and hold them accountable for the ""Democracy"" they claim to be while exporting more of the same."
1,Please...,"One of the many biases of this book is that it ignores the fact that during the early 1930's Hitler seemed to be yet another right wing kook, which Europe and Latin America were full of. There were hardly any liberal democracies in that age, so companies did deal with left wing and right wing dictators. Most American, British and French companies did stop dealing with him once it became obvious that he was worse than your average banana republic dictator.As for the post W.W.2 ""collaborations"", the U.S. actively pursued Nazi war criminals. Only some rocket and nuclear scientist who had knowledge thought to be necessary to defeat Stalin (who killed nearly as many as Hitler) were employed.Dated, paranoid book."
1,Rip Off,"What a complete rip off. The 5"" by almost 6"" cookbook that comes with it is maybe worth 2 dollars( I think they used card stock for the cover anyway ). Your better off getting plain planks(more planks and alot cheaper). Save your money for better products this isn't one of them."
1,Wrong Description!,"The editorial review of this DVD is the wrong one. It applies to ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" and not this title! I purchased this, remembering ""Irontail"" from my youth. However, ""Irontail"" does not appear in this DVD. It is a cartoon and not claymation. The cartoon is fine for small tykes but make sure you are ordering the correct title!"
2,This has NOTHING to do with Easter,Cute story about Peter Rabbit and my son enjoys it but I only give it 2 stars b/c the title suggests that this story has something to do with Easter. The discription of this DVD is completely incorrect.
2,The old saying is true; there is no accounting for taste.,"The writing is bad, the voices are annoying, the animation is cheesy.... But my two year old daughter LOVES it! At least twenty times a day we hear the goofy theme music start up as she pops it in the VCR and starts hopping around our living room in her bunny ears. Her enthusiasm alone earns it two stars. And you know what? If something were to happen to her beloved bunnies, I would immediately order a replacement copy. She looks awfully cute in those bunny ears."
1,The Pug Bread Recipe Book: First Edition,This is not a paperback but rather sheets of paper. Very misleading.
2,Doesn't work,"Doesn't work like it should. Instructions say to push the SRC button to access remote CD changer and it doesn't bring it up. Am returning it to the dealer I bought it from, post haste!!"
4,Great Book.,"This was the first of the Wilderness series that I read and I am hooked. If you like Judal Sackett by Louis L'Amour, you will love the Wilderness Series. Thompson is a lot like L'Amour in that his characters are seeking the great wilderness to be free. The characters are flawed but that is what makes them so great. Lots of suspense. The story is about an old miner who stubles into a gold mine about the time he is about to give up. Then he is kidnapped by some outlaws and that is were the hero comes in. Great story."
4,Naruto keychain,"Nice keychain, awesome if you are a Naruto fan. I use the keychain as a decoration on my backpack. The metal leaf symbol can get caught in your pocket, so it doesn't function well as a keychain. The insignia is a little bit too large to make it into a necklace medalion. but is doable."
1,no go.,"yeah....this cd bit. i bought chillout sessions 4 last year, and looked forward to buying this compilation as well. unfortunately, it didn't live up to the last one. out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd, i liked 2-3...and they were all on other compilations i already own. the same was true for the second cd. this was not worth the money. i was very disappointed."
4,"MOS Does It Again,","Ministry Of Sound has always had the reputation of putting out the best music. They have a way of findind the best DJ's, Artists, producers and remixers from the 4 corners of the earth and bringing them to us on a CD. This CD is no exception. Soothing beats without lacking in tempo or energy, this CD could literally be enjoyed by a cowbow from Kentucky. It's just that palattable."
4,Church Renewal and God's Dream,"An excellent presentation of how one minister's church responded to the search for God's will for a church and its people. It is sure to be helpful in at least some ways for all churches. Seeking God's will is always a first step. He has some excellnt ideas that have been proven in his church and I am certain they will work in most churches today. Revival of the ""dead"" in our churches is at a critical point. Too many people merely warm the pew. Rev. Wills gives some excellent and detailed steps to church renewal. Well written and easy to put into practice, with God's blessing, of course."
4,"Excellent songs, original guitar work. Get it.","I can't believe no one's reviewed this. I recommend all of his solo work including this, Red Cities and Wandering as Water, as well as his work with Codeine, Come and Consonant."
1,Save Your Money,"As the only previous reviewer declares, this is a hodge-podge selection, not likely to satisfy even the most rabid Gould fan. Excerpts from the Goldberg Variations? Keyboard transcriptions of symphonic works? Might the publisher be trying to squeeze the last dollar from the devotees?"
3,"Great movie, could have been a better documentary","This film felt far too much like a fictional war scenario because of the theatrics. This doesn't make it a bad film. If you are looking for a documentary, watch ""Restrepo."""
4,When they say mini...,"They MEAN mini! The kit in its entirety was great, the laughs it got at the baby shower ALONE is worth the money spent. But the book is super-small and it's a tad difficult to see the detail in the pictures (like the baby underneath all the groceries in the cart on the ""shopping with baby"" page). This, along with a little onesie with a sassy phrase, and a package of pee-pee teepees, makes a funny little tongue-in-cheek gift that won't be forgotten soon, even with the sleep deprivation."
4,Quite amusing,"Nice little package for the price. Laughed quite a bit when we received it, though it is very MINI."
2,SAMPLES TOO COOL 4 CD,I BOUGHT THIS CD AND IT PRETTY MUCH SUCKS. GOOD ROCKIN MUSIC BUT THE SINGER/SONGS RUB ME THE WRONG WAY.
3,A bit of a disappointment,"First I would like to say to anyone who really liked this book, don't get offended. I just have to say that 'The Power of the Night' was a bit disappointing after reading 'A Shadow at Evening'.I don't know enat it lacked, but it definately lacked something. When I read the first one, I was living it, in fact I couldn't but it down. But I struggled to finish the second one. I hope that Walley writes a third book that has the same power of the first one.I gave it three stars because I just couldn't get into it. But it is still worth reading."
4,"Good fit and quality, perfect for S400","I have this little case, and it's perfect for the S400. It cushions the camera without being overly thick. I can usually fit the camera in this case in my pants pocket. It has NO room for accessories, so if you're looking for a carry-all look for something else. This case only protects the camera. It has a beltloop for wearing on your belt, and a little hole in the flap for the camera's strap to go through. It closes securely with velcro."
5,nice little camera,"easy to carry, easy to shoot, easy to sownload and great pictures. battery has lasted for over 5 years so far"
4,Canon ELPH Leather Case,"This is a cute little black case. My S410 4MP camera fits perfectly in this case (there is no room for anything else, so if you are looking for a camera bag which will fit all your accessories, don't buy this case).The only down side is the big tacky gold lettering on the case. I wish they used smaller fonts in silver lettering. But it's a good case to lug your camera around in if you go on short trips."
5,"Good quality. Fits S400, a little tight in the beginning","This camera case is constructed with good quality. The belt clip is quite handy. The small size gives you the option to slip the whole thing into the pocket. A reviewer suggested that the soft leather may not provide enough protection, but I think this camera case is a good compromise between size and protection. Really on a daily basis, the most fragile part of the camera is the LCD screen. This camera case would be sufficient to prevent scratches. There isn't a whole lot of reason to get a bulkier case and sacrifice the option to slip it into the pocket.The fit for my S400 camera was too tight in the beginning, and it took some effort to get the camera out of the case. However, the leather stretched to fit the camera after a week or so. Now the fit is perfect.What I don't particularly care for is the large, gold logo ""Canon Elph"" which I'm afraid invites undesirable attention.If you have a Canon Digital Elph you need to get this case."
4,The original witty Slim,It is incredible how much of his material would even for today be considered original and ahead of its time .But yet at the same time having this childish and simple humor such as de-ranging known phrases and basically creating his own language out of it.Slim is a one of a kind and should be remembered amongs the greats of jazz and witty music.
3,"Great concept, disappointing photos and descriptions","I am disappointed by this book. The paper quality does not do justice to the photos. Colors and defintion are washed out. Furthermore, while I only skimmed through the book I noticed several typos.I was also surprised to see the Taj Mahal and Hong Kong and a lot of other very cool places ommitted, while Florida (!) was included."
5,Nicolai Gedda - Do not miss this is you are a tenor fan.,"This 2 disc package is a real feast of Nicolai Gedda's art. I am not qualified to comment on the technicalities of his performances but I think you would be hard to please if you did not absolutely love this album. He sings well known arias in Italian, French, German and Russian and his diction is flawless in all languages. A wonderful rich two or more hours of beautiful singing. BUY IT - You will not be disappointed!"
4,Excellent compilation,"Beautiful, easy lyric tenor; also great diction and phrasing -- a good example to any tenor on how this rep. should be sung."
2,Not original recordings,"I wasn't aware that the recordings on this CD are not the original recordings; they are re-makes that don't sound at all like the originals. If there was fine print that stated this, I didn't see it."
1,Antiquity for Dummies,"I was so disappointed in this book. It impossible to tell which of the author's points are based in fact, or are merely speculative, as he provides absolutely no documentation for any of them. I was not expecting a heavily footnoted, post-graduate textbook, but I did anticipate at least some substantiation for the author's many, many claims."
2,Not worth the time,"While Cantor has written a lot about history, this book is not really very good. Some of his writting is too cynical, some is just plain wrong, and some so contrdictory as to be silly. His chapter about the Justinian code is ridiculous because the Justinian code is the wave of the future, a code subject to abuse, a threat to the left and right in Europe who model the European Union's proposed constitution after it, etc. I read the chapter twice to see if i missed something or that Cantor must not have read his own material because it was just plain dumb.There are many books about this subject matter, thousands in fact, but i wouldn't waste my time with this book which is more like a Reader's Digest for Cliff Note readers about Antiquity. I read it because there were so many positive reviews, but the readers who are critical of the book have good reason to call Cantor to task."
1,Adults need not apply,"Clearly written for students, this book is pedantic and condescending in tone, starting from the author's note that the books is ""an attempt to communicate to the educated reader"" some basic knowledge of antiquity. As an educated reader with degrees in zoology, anthropology and medicine, I found his whirlwind tour through 2.5 million years to be contamtinated with editorial comments, clear bias and several factual errors. Unless you are a very young educated reader who is ready to be led down this very personal path of historical opinion, skip this tome."
1,"Poorly written, poorly conceptualized","I'm a professor and I picked up this book thinking it might be useful to assign a chapter or two to students as background information for a comparative cultures course I will teach. Like many other reviewers I thought the book was remarkably poor. In addition to factual errors and tendentious interpretations, the book is incredibly poorly written. I thought it might be suitable to teach at the undergraduate level, but in fact it reads as if it were written by an undergraduate, or a very gifted high school student. At times it seems as if portions of the book weren't finished and the sentence-long paragraphs that appear in it are the remains of the outline the author wrote from. I'm saddened, but not surprised, that Cantor wrote a book like this. What does surprise me is that his editors published it in this form. Frankly, its an embarrassment. Given the enormous amount of good books on antiquity available, there is no reason to read this one."
1,Better to Stay Medievalist than Becoming Bad Classicist.,"Simply a bad book. It reads as a tired output of an old man fulfilling a task. His ideas about Roman empire fall sounds, in fact, like those you could read in XIX century divulgation book for children. He talks of a biomedical crisis, but he does not offer data neither deep reasonning to support such simplistic idea. It seems like Mr Cantor believes the Roman Empire fell because too much people begun too used to die.Pitiful book for such a renowned historian."
3,"Simplistic, opinionated but worth reading","This book serves as a rough and ready introduction to antiquity. It's short and covers a lot of ground. The writing is breezy and easy to digest.If you have no background in this area and want some rough guidelines-- go for it. It covers the most important broad stokes well.If you are familiar with ancient history this book suffers from many generalizations, oversimplifications and even some outright errors. Oh and the writing isn't very elegant. But Cantor still makes many good points and it's a challenge to spot some of these above problems and turn them over in your mind. Kind of auto-Socratic! Any big survey book spanning this range of time and cultures typically has lots of problems. At least this one makes some useful bridges between the ideas and cultures of antiquity and is a quick read.This book has it's place among many better books on ancient history in my library."
1,"well-written, but highly inaccurate and biased summary of ancient history","I bought this book because I'm interested in ancient civilizations in general and the Sumerian civilization in particular.Cantor knows nothing about the Sumerian civilization.His history of Greece and Rome is better, but still doubtful.Overall, while the book is written concisely, it is highly misleading and biased."
4,Nice guitar,I got this for my son who is a beginner. It is a very good guitar for the money. He really likes it. It came well packaged in a guitar box inside another big box with lots of padding. It only has 1 mount for the strap but this is normal on most acoustic guitars.
3,great deal for beginners.,the guitar at first was great and easy to work with. when i say this is a beginners guitar it is a beginners guitar. i've played my whole life. classically trained. a couple hard flamenco songs after 4 months the strings shave away the bridge and the neck and you're stuck with nonstop buzzing. i tried to fix it but nothing worked. tried to lift it change parts no use!! not customizable at all. i thought i'd have a fun guitar away from home and that's all it was for 4 months. for beginners it's great. for seasoned players i say stay away you'll be disappointed.
5,Nice Guitar in general,"Quite nice guitar, as a starter in playing guitar, this one satisfies all I need, the sound is beautiful. However you may what to change the string since the original ones are a little bit SHARP, especially the bottom two. You may also want to buy some ADD-ON items so they can be shipped together."
4,Awesome inexpensive guitar,"I got this guitar off of Amazon about 6 months ago. I'm nothing but impressed. My only criticism is that the action is a bit high. But by no means unplayable. With a bit of set up work it would probably be perfect. It plays well, stays in tune, and sound great for it price point. I've recorded a couple of songs with it and it sounded great in the mix. I've owned a Takamine 12 string for over 25 years. Based on that experience I took a chance on this guitar. I have not been disappointed."
2,its ok,not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway
5,Great Guitar,All I can say is WOW! This is a great Guitar for the money. I have a $600 guitar and this little gem sound very close to it. I highly recommend this guitar to anyone wanting a second or third guitar. I do recommend getting new strings after the first week as they came with some really old ones.
2,Before you buy this guitar please read!!!,"This is the guitar I have now and I have been playing for about 2 years. I would only suggest it for someone who isnt sure if playing the guitar is right for them or not. If you know you want to play guitar and its a passion then spend the extra money on something that will be able to keep up with your skill level as you get better. You really cant put a price on music, so go to the music store nearest you and just set down for an hour and play around on anything you can. You wont find the right guitar, it finds you and when it does you will know. Just so you know you get what you pay for and I just dont see someone wanting to be a legit guitarist after playing this. As soon as you play someone elses guitar you will want something better. Just do the research and I promise you will be so happy. Hope I Helped."
3,cheap,"I've been around guitars my whole life because my dad has always played them, but never taught me. So I know a bit about guitars. I was dissapointed in the material, because it looks very much like balsa wood. But the sound is decent enough for a beginner guitar."
2,Came Damaged- Had to return it,Guitar came broken- back of guitar showed separation from main body so I had to return it. Not impressed with the overall build quality. Maybe damaged in shipping however.
5,Great Guitar for the Price,I bought this guitar as a gift for my son. He had sold his Yamaha a while back because he needed the money. The purpose was to get him something to hold him over until he could afford a more expensive guitar.I am glad to say he is very pleased with this one. We did replace the strings immediately (if you are a guitar player you know what I am talking about) with Elixir strings. The guitar has a good full tone and after the strings were replaced it even sounds better than the Yamaha he had before. The guitar holds its tuning well and so far seems to be built very well.While this guitar is not in the class of guitars that are much more expensive it is an outstanding value for being under $100. I've heard guitars that are 2-3 times as expensive and their tone was not any better.
5,An Excellent Cheap Guitar,This is the guitar that I take to my guitar lesson rather than my much more expensive Martin. It has a reasonable sound and easy playing action. For the price this guitar can't be beat.
2,doesn't stay in tune,"bought this cheap guitar to learn for the first time. Figured that I shouldn't pay much in case I stop wanting to play. This guitar can not stay in tune. Extremely light, cheap feeling, and came with scratches. Don't really care about the guitar appearence, but should stay in tune."
2,Cheaply made...for a kid not a serious musician,"I had bought this guitar and had it sent as one day shipping only to send it back the very same day. First of all the flimsy box containing the guitar had nothing around to protect the plywood ""guitar"" and was shipped in a huge over sized box with nothing inside to protect it from anything. As cheap as the guitar is made and with no protection I am surprised there is as many good reviews on this guitar. I bought it because it seemed safe due to all the raving how good it was for a cheapo...I was VERY upset at the material this was made from. I am being nice giving it a 2 because it is play able for a kid or something.. but NOT for a serious musician. Actually.. I have seen guitars made better for kids."
2,Don't buy,"I got this Guitar as a gift, I don't like it one bit. My friends and I are learning the guitar and all of there guitars sound great! But mine (the jasmine by takamine s35 acoustic guitar) won't play well! I hope to get a new one soon, for me its truely sad. I wished it play well but it does not so I can't do much about it. This is a warning if you are buying a guitar and want one to play well don't DON'T get this one! If you are buying someone this or have bought someone this you should consisder getting them a different guitar. For its price I guess its ok.... also I can't even play a song on it :( I hope to maybe get a new one soon!!!!!"
2,pretty mediocre,"I've had this guitar for 9 months now and was my first guitar ever. I read the reviews here and was very optimistic. got it and started playing and sounds decent there was just one fret that would buzz everytime i played it. but around 2 months ago the fret buzz started getting worse and worse. it started happening on more and more frets. my high e string now is almost entirely unplayable. i dont know if maybe the dry colorado climate has anything to do with it, maybe i got a defective one, i don't know, but its definitely aggravating. it was a good guitar to learn on but i am in definite need of an upgrade. i would enjoy playing my high e string."
4,A Guitar to Begin With,"A Nice Beginner Instrument. I've had it for three months and I'm still plugging away as a beginner. It does have nice sound. Mine, however, now has two tuners that rattle a bit sometimes. The knobs are just a hair loose. But can you really expect more from an otherwise good quality guitar for less than $100? Sooner, or later, I'll put some decent tuners on it."
5,Excellent guitar,This is an excellent guitar for a good price. I'm starting guitar classes and this guitar just sounds good. Very happy with the purchase I made
4,My first guitar,"I don't know much about guitars, but I enjoy the sound coming from this one. My wife got a 3/4 classic nylon string guitar on craigslist that sounds funny compared to this full-bodied steel string.I'll probably get the strings changed soon (since everyone says the originals suck) but they are working for me! I'm learning my chords and building up calluses!"
2,Even for beginners don't buy this guitar,"Spend a little bit more if you really want to start guitar.Easily out of tune, buzzing strings, cheaply built and ugly sticker.More headaches for the beginner. You want it easy as a beginner, not a headache"
1,poor guitar. not recommended for anyone,"I'm a beginner, so I thought I'd buy this guitar since it's one of the cheaper ones that I've found online and it had good reviews. I got it, and it's was such a bad guitar that I returned it less than 24 hours (upgraded to a cheap Fender). The strings were so far from the neck that it would have been very hard and frustrating to learn on this, and there was buzzing in the first and second frets. Don't waste your time or money on this guitar. Spend a little more and get something worth playing and learning on."
1,Pretty bad,"Clunky, low quality material, dismal tone quality. Very flimsy. Not my cup of tea if you know what I mean."
4,Good value starter guitar,"This is the second guitar I bought from Amazon and I wish I'd read about this one first. It doesn't hold tune over night or for long sessions, but this is minor anoyance to me. For the price, it's a great deal. Nice finish, nice feel. Too bad none of the extras, like tuner, strap, etc. came with it, so the true price is a bit more than for just the guitar. Still, it plays and sounds nice."
4,Nice for the Price,My girlfriend got me started on playing the guitar a few months ago and bought me this guitar.I am not a great player but what I found was that this guitar seemed to fit me well and the sound is so nice that it makes you want to learn and to play.I started out just doing familiar runs by sound but now I am going back and learning the notes so I can read music because I think I will make a lot more progress that way.
3,marimbraz,"for beginners this is a great guitar. I bought it because the price was fair. I had to buy new strings cause one of them broke, but other then that it was ok."
4,For the price its hard to beat,"While it's not the best guitar ever, for the price it is an excellent entry level guitar. If you are looking for a first guitar to buy you cant go wrong with this one. I would recommend getting the strings changed right away the strings they give you are terrible but you can get new ones put on for 10-20 bucks. It has a solid sound, nothing incredible but pretty rich sounding. Like I said, for the price you can't really go wrong with this."
4,Beautiful,"This is a very nice, reasonably priced acoustic by a very reputable manufacturer. It souds and looks GREAT! Its Gorgeous!!!"
5,wow,"This guitar is awesome! I have bought a lot of expensive guitars and realizing I wasted my money, this guitar is very good priced for its quality."
4,So far I'm pleased.,"I have never lifted a guitar,let alone play one, but I'lm trying to learn. The Jasmine was inexpensive, looks great and was easy (after several trys) to tune. The strings, all steel, sound wonderful even to my untrained ear , when played. What a difference tuning makes!I'm starting out with very simple songs from a ""self help"" book, which for me is essential.I try to set aside 30 to 60 minutes a day to practice and to learn. I'm 77 years old and having lot's of fun. So far the guitar is great.I hope my enthusiasm continues.Jim"
5,Amazing!!!!,This is my first guitar. This sounds too good for the steal of a price I purchased it at. Thank you Amazon and thank you Takamine. Arrived on the first day of the estimated delivery time frame and in protective packaging that left the strings and actual head in perfect condition!!!!!
2,Irritating Buzzing Noise,"The title itself explains pretty much. When I first received the guitar, I thought it was flawless. It wasn't so expensive, had a simple design and had a decent sound. But after three days of playing, I started hearing some buzzing sound and the buzzing noise got even worse after a week. It's the lowest string at 1st and 2nd fret where the buzzing noise always occurs. It's so irritating that I'll have to go to a local musical instrument store to check with the professionals. The only reason I'm not returning this guitar is just because it is cheap. That is all for sure."
5,"For the price, you can't go wrong!!","I have played for some time and this is my third guitar. My others were a Gibson and a Yamaha. I would rate this guitar on par with the Gibson, it is a small body guitar so if you learned on the jumbo, there is less sound boom. I bought mine through Amazon and it arrived in perfect condition!! Good buy, plays fine."
5,Phenominal Quality For Price,"You will not believe what a quality guitar this is for the price! I have a Martin DM Mahogany in addition to this and I swear this Jasmine sounds every as good as the $800 Martin-GO FIGURE!!! I would put this guitar head to head with about any of higher end guitars and it will hold its own. As far as the Martin, to be honest I wish I had gotten a Taylor after one of those I may be selling good ol Martin for a Taylor! But I do like having a piece of history but back to the Jasmine, buy it, you won't be disappointed unless your picky and nothing ever pleases you in which case nothing will satisfy someone who is like that."
1,I am disappointed,"I was looking forward to receive that item for a week. After I check this,I was frustrated because that was broken. I couldn't wrap the fourth guitar line. I can't tune so I coudn't play it in fron of my fellows.I hope the representive should check carefully your items. I shipped that through post office to get the fully refund including delivery fee.Jasmine Takamine S35 Acoustic Guitar, Natural"
1,Terrible,It came in a beat up box and a guitar string was broken. Terrible. It wasn't tuned or anything. I was trying to surprise my boyfriend with something he'd been wanting for a long time. Too bad it was broken. Piece of shit. Completely dissatisfied!
1,never recieve,"hello my name is MIchael owner of this account.the product above i never receive. D martines that sign for that isn't me and i don't know that person as well.so please i need to know where is my product, tks"
1,Try it-you'll like it,"A lot of guitar for the money.Not too happy with the matte finish,but still looks good.Rugged.Great sound for the dollar.Take anywhere guitar.Strings are surprisingly good,too.Just tune 'er up+you're ready to party.This guitar was delivered the fastest of any I have purchased on line.Thank You,Takamine and Amazon!!"
1,Shipped a Broken Guitar,"I've seen people on television such as Jimmy Page and Neil Young make nice sounds come out of the guitar by holding the long part in one hand and using the other hand to pinch and wiggle the strings. So you can imagine by excitement when my guitar finally arrived at my house. However, much to my dismay, when I held the long part in one hand and used the other hand to pinch and wiggle the strings, only bad sounds came out. I tried painting the guitar a different color, but this did nothing to help. I can only assume that the device I was shipped is broken and needs repair."
5,Christmas present,"I've bought several of these guitars. I bought one for my grandchildren and after seeing what a sturdy guitar it was and what a good sound it had, I bought one for my husband. I was pleasantly surprised at the finish and how well-made it was. While nothing fancy, it was well worth the money for beginners and nice enough for someone who knows how to play. I'm very pleased."
5,=),"I just got this guitar yesterday, and I spent pretty much 5 hours straight just playing with it last night. Then I woke up and played it some more. So, I now type this review with sore but satisfied fingers. XPHands down one of the better-sounding guitars I've played with this price tag. I greatly recommend it. =)"
5,Wrestle Maina-- The First 13 Years,"This is a great collection of the first 13 years of Wrestle Maina. It's so much fun looking back at the earlier years. Wrestle Maina III is still the greatest of all time. I've had this set for over nine years now, and still think it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.I would highly recomend buying this collection instead of the Wrestle Maina Anthology DVD set (or at least the first two sets of five) because unlike that collection, this one contains absolutely no editing. No editing of the logos, the music, or the ""WWF"" references. Each WM is shown as it originally aired on pay-per-view, except for Wrestle Mania XI, which is the ""Encore Plus"" version, but still has no editing. So if you're a true wrestling fan, forget those DVD's from the Anthology collection and start with this set. It's truly a must have."
5,Wireless Headset,It is a great product and makes playing the game much more enjoyable being wireless - it is also a very sharp looking headset as well.
3,Good headset,This Wireless Headset is very non-intrusive and comfortable for game play. Players will have no problem wearing this for extended game play. This product has very good battery life.
2,overpriced junk,"I got to use this for one game session. The next time I tried to use it, the thing wouldn't even turn on, wouldn't charge - nothing! Microsoft support was no help, thankfully the store took it back. Its certainly the most fashionable 360 headset, but probably the least functional (no mute button!?! I realize I could turn the thing off if playing a game I'm not chatting in, but then I risk having to hear gamers scream over surround sound, which means the whole house has to hear it as well - not pleasant). The headset isn't really adjustable in any significant way, which was an issue for me, because the mic was always visible in the corner of my eye, and I've got elephant ears.All in all, it looks pretty sharp (especially with a Halo 3 360), and maybe at $30 I'd be able to overlook the missing features and performance issues, but this is not worth the suggested price. Stick with the included 360 headset, it may be junk too, but at least its cheap!"
3,Worked Great . . . Untill It Didn't,"I bought this on February 1st. It worked PERFECTLY until today, May 1st. Exactly three months of responsible use and the battery stops taking a charge.COINCIDENCE?!. . . Probably. But it still makes me very angry. Consumers should not put up with short-lived electronics. It IS possible to make these things last for more than a few months. I just hope I can find some warranty information. Cost me $60."
4,Works awesome :),Its totally awesome :) Just wish there was another way to quickly mute myself then turning the unit off :( I live with a talkative family so i tend to turn my corded one off a lot via switch but this one doesn't have such a way :( but otherwise its totally awesome! :D
5,Better than the rest!!!,"This is the new wireless headset designed around Halo3 it works way better than all the other headsets made for the 360. They fixed the connection problems with the unit meaning (No More Droped or lagged connections), Increased Batt life (Meaning longer playtime than the origional) and best of all it's a Halo3 product which looks pretty cool and high tech when battling online & chatting. A perfect item for any Halo fan!!"
1,It was great...while it worked.,"I loved this headset. It had great sound quality, it was comfortable, and it had a good battery life. Up until it died, one month or so out of warranty. There was no damage to it, it hasn't been dropped, or gotten wet, or anything. It was just sitting on a table. It worked fine two nights ago, and tonight, nothing. No power. I plugged it in to the USB charger that came with it. Nothing. No lights to indicate it was charging. So I plugged it into my PC to see if it was a bad USB port. No dice. I tried my cellphone charger, nothing. So here I am, with a completely dead, four month old, $60 headset.I think I'll go back to a wired one. At least when they die, they're cheaper to replace."
2,A sharp drop off from the first novel . . .,"The first novel read more like a descent work of historical fiction. The second read more like a bad love story.In ""The Puma's Shadow"" you were introduced to the Inca culture and lands and the events leading to their demise. Atahualpa and Pizarro came to life and the chapters detailing the events that took place in Cajamarca took me back to a place I visited years ago.""The Gold of Cuzco"" took me no where. The story line was in short, totally unbelievable. The ""setting up the scene"" was not much better. I was especially disappointed in the descriptions of Sacsayhuaman and Coricancha. It was almost as if the authors had never visited Cuzco, a place from which I had just returned.Read it if you want to finish the trilogy but don't expect to enjoy it too much."
1,Canon A200 Case,The case advertised as an accessory for the Canon A100 and A200 cameras is for the Canon Elph and will not fit the A100 or A200 camera.
1,psc-40 leather case for a100 & 200,"The case that gets sent is not the case shown on web site. The case sent is for the elph size camera. If you can put 10 lbs of crement in a 5 lb bag, than you it will work for you, but I can't do it. This was a waste of time and money."
4,Fits the S110 but not as snug nor as small as I had hoped.,"Based on other good reviews, I purchased this case for my Canon S110. It fit well, not snug. The case is a little baggy, which is what you probably want since you will be sliding the camera in and out when you need to use it.I was a little unhappy with the case for two reasons:1) It has large gold lettering screened on the leather reading ""Canon ELPH"". But I could forgive that, a sticker would cover it well enough.2) My major argument is the belt loop; it has a lip around the back of the case, which adds to the size of the case and made the whole thing a bit cumbersome for my tastes.That aside, this is a really nice case for the S110. It just wasn't as slim and trim as I was hoping."
1,Nice case but...,"This is not the case advertised. It is very small and not made of leather, but of some type of nylon material. I was able to get it on sale and use it for a small camera, but it is not worth the full price for a lie of an advertisement."
2,"Great book, format difficult to read","This is one of my favorite stories by an incredible author; the stars in this review would be 5 if on story alone...however, I ordered this for my son and will be returning it because the format is really difficult for a younger reader. The text is crammed onto each page: minimal margins and almost no space between each line. It's hard for me to make it all the way from left to right without jumping lines. I will look more carefully for a book with a more standard and readable printing."
1,Finger pincher!,"This olive pitter pinches your fingers! It is awful! I have thin fingers, but somehow the meat on my pointer gets caught between the metal pieces when I squeeze it closed! Ouch!!!"
1,The pitts.,I've used various plastic pitters before with great success. This one did nothing but punch holes in 3 dozen cherries. I think it actually pitted about 3 of the cherries. Don't waste your money. Maybe it does olives better.
4,Not up to prior recordings,"This cd is a little strange. The ""tracks"" are almost like snippets of song parts strung together. Many of them are under a minute and just run together without you knowing it. Supposedly, you can put this on ""random"" for a different cd at every listening. Unique but kind of weird. I tend to like the repeating of parts of songs that I really like. This is good but not up to the standard of their prior albums which are very good. Worth buying for sure though."
1,"It's not cloth, it's PLASTIC.","The description says cloth. Unfortunately, it's PLASTIC cloth. Like a thick trash bag. This will be OK for covering a window to create my darkroom, but I can't very well wear this over my back and head to block light from the ground glass focusing screen on my 4x5 camera. It's not cloth. Ugh."
4,Inspiring!,"Really Inspiring book.This isn't really a self-help book. It's more an autobiography.So if you expect a step by step method you could better buy ""Unlimited power"" by Anthony Robbins."
4,Movie FX DVD -- great deal,"I wanted to comment on this DVD. Since Movie Magic ( the tv show) went off the air I have been looking for something like this, found reference to it on the Discreet support forums and bought the first issue as a 'test' ..There is some great material in here, my favorite being the maquette sculpting piece. I am on my way to order the second issue, All in all its a great e-zine, which will go well with my Cinefex magazine."
1,"Bottle shattered, trip to ER","After using this style opener for several years I just broke a bottle in my hands. Yesterday, while pulling an unusually stiff cork out, the bottle neck shattered sending me to the local emergency room for stitches. This design puts a lot of stress on the bottle neck when the tangs are pressed in. Combine that with twisting and pulling and i believe there is a high risk of failure.You may have better luck than I, but I wanted to warn others. I am typing this with one hand because of the stitches. No fun!"
4,impressive toy for guests or picnics,"I first saw a two prong wine opener in the hands of a wine-connoisseur and decided i had to have one.The Pedrini two prong corkpuller serves its aesthetic purpose well, it's cheap, but it bends out of shape after a good bit of use. I would say for practicality, any plunger/screw wine opener works faster and more consistently (sometimes the two prong pushes the cork in if you're not careful or tipsy).I would recommend this to anyone who feels like they can look cool for a whole 5 minutes as they wiggle this thing in around the cork. It's also slightly more satisfying getting a cork out with this thing if you're into complicating easy tasks."
2,Broken After One Year,"Purchased in November of 2011 and used quite frequently for the past year. I thought it worked ok, but I wasn't that impressed with the quality of the opener. Unfortunately, one of the tines just broke just over a year after purchase."
5,Sublime Music Making,"I've listened to most available recordings of Schumann's Piano Quartet, but this one stands out. If you expect Glenn Gould's eccentricy, no need to worry here. He is a brilliant chamber musician and gives very sensitive and balanced contribution to Julliard Qt's deeply felt yet intelligent playing. The slow movement of Op.47 (probably the most sublimely beautiful music Schumann ever wrote) is more slowly paced than Beaux Arts Trio's performance, and the music unfolds just like a dream. I've never known more inspired and expressive performances.Beaux Arts Trio recorded the same work and theirs is also superb performance, but I prefer this one as I can not stand Beaux Arts Trio's squeaky violinist! Another thing I like about Gould's version is the fine balance between piano and strings. No single instrument dominates in these performances, yet every instrument sings and blend beautifully."
5,the most charming unhorthodox performance I've ever heard,This Schumann quartet recording is the most fascinating little piece I've ever heard. Obviously Glenn Gould and the Julliard String quartet did not get along very well when they recorded the thing - it is clearly perceptible in the recording. But this awesome contrast is completely fascinating. Is my favorite recording of the Schumann quartet. A must buy!
4,Only one step down from The Barron's AP Statistics Book.,Well organized and has and excellent selection of test questions. I use this book only slightly less often than the Barron's book.
3,its ok,"I pretty much only did the practice tests. those were good, but I cannot comment on the actual text. I did not experience the ""learning process"" from the book. The questions were a little different then the type on the test, but I got a 5 so maybe it helped!"
2,Too through,"All topics are covered to the extend that by the time I got through I already forgot what I was studying, but that can be a good thing for certain people. There are many informations that are downplayed on the exams. The practice multiple choice is a little easier that actual exam. The practice free response is too simple and narrowed."
5,"just what I wanted, the brother one I bought does not compare",This smart label maker is exactly what I needed. The brother is still sitting in the box. I would not use another one
5,I've loved this printer for years,I recently had to replace my old one and got this new one. Love it!!!!! So glad I got a new one!
4,Great,"This gets the job done like any other electrical tape would, it's not as sticky as the other named brands but still works."
5,You get what you pay for,"This tape is about 10X the cost of the cheap tapes, however it is 3-4X as sticky, and about twice as stretchy. When you are making connections deep under the dashboard of your car, the few extra dollars gives me the piece of mind that those connections will last, and not short out in 1-2 years when the adhesive fails."
5,A real page turner! I couldn't put it down!,"Jewel Flannery is one of Pinkerton's best operatives: She doesn't give a damn about social norms, but is willing to use every trick in the book, plus all her feminine wiles to get the job done. Unfortunately, her concentration is shot-to-hell ever since she ran into riverboat gambler Brent Connors in her last few 'assignments.'Brent Connors has seen Jewel with 3 different 'fathers,' in 3 different disguises, in as many months. Even though he thinks she's nothing but a con artist, he finds himself falling for her hard & fast. When her search turns up her real father, a famous jewel thief, she must choose which love is worth fighting for."
5,A biased reader loves this book,"Jeff's review may be self serving, but so is mine - my dad, the late Bill Alton, is interviewed in the book. This is probably one of the best books about Second City because it is written in the words of those who created Second City. Don't get me wrong, Sheldon's new book is O.K. but this book is better. Bless Jeff for getting these interviews before we lost too many of the original performers. If you can only get one book about Second City - buy this one."
3,"It works, but too noizy","I found nothing special about this model. Includes standard set of accessories. Think is too noizy and bulky. One piece came broken during shipping. Called vendor, got replacement part free of charge."
5,The Definitive Guide to America's War in Vietnam,"Michael Maclear is a Canadian, and wrote this book from a non-American perspective. As such, it offers an objective view of America's involvement in Southeast Asia and the Vietnam War. I cannot recommend this book more strongly for anyone who wants a comprehensive understanding of one of America's darkest moments."
5,fantastic pen,"This pen is a pleasure to use. Even makes me want to do my taxes just to have a reason to use it! (just kidding) But really, this pen is so comfortable--and writes good too. I won't buy any other."
5,Like to Sprout? You NEED a Few of These!,"I bought 3 Easy Sprout Sprouters 1 year ago and I use them nearly every single day. They are perfect in every way and make sprouting a breeze. The results that I have gotten in this awesome little device far exceed the outcomes of using a container with a cloth over it, etc. These Sprouters are also great for soaking nuts/legumes that you don't want to sprout--just pull up the inner container and rinse. That's way better than using a bowl, tilting it to let out the soaking water, and letting half the nuts/legumes escape while you're at it. My mom also bought herself a few and she loves them too. These Sprouters truly make sprouting pleasurable and super duper easy! Awesomeness all around!"
5,Easy Sprouter,"Put away your jars, this is way easier. Not only does it rinse and drain better than all other methods, the sprouts stay fresh for days and days when refridgerated in the container."
5,Simple but works well,"It just looks like a plain plastic cup but the designer invested serious thought and testing into this product. The use of a bottom vented inner cup allows ventilation space both beneath and above the sprouts, helping reduce mold problems. The biggie with a vented inner cup design is you can easily pull it out, rinse the sprouts and shake out the extra water. Not so easy to do with a tray or jar. The other little touches like built-in measuring cup, removable small seed catcher, etc. help make sprouting simple for beginners and busy folk. Plus, it only takes up a wee amount of space and makes little mess. And, yep, my first attempt resulted in a full cup of spicy radish sprouts. I'll be using this pricy but extremely able plastic cup every week!Search for Sprouthouse videos on YouTube for tutorials if you prefer not to read instructions. A few minutes of video and the concept should be clear to even the greenest noob."
1,Works,I had become frustrated with hulls and decided to try this Easy Sprout. It did make my sprouting experience easier. I like being able to pop the same container in the fridge.
3,Smaller seeds bunch up at bottom of the cup,"I'm reviewing this product from the standpoint of growing alfalfa and other type small sprout seeds. The seeds tend to pile up at the bottom of the cup bottom screen, not so much in mason jars. You have to break up the growing sprout clusters, not so much with mason jars. I added a squirt of seaweed extract and it seemed to have affected the taste of the sprouts using the Easy Sprout even tho I rinsed and spun the cup well after a seaweed extract short soak. I found that thorough rinsing wasn't as easy with this product as compared to the mason jar method.Also, more of my seeds sprouted and grew fuller with the mason jar method."
5,Awesome,"I cannot believe how easy this is; and the sprouts come out perfect. I've tried at home sprouting before only to end up sproutless and frustrated, now I am inspired. This product will not let you down. I also love the organic sprouting seeds that Amazon carries. Joy, joy!"
4,Works well,"Easier than some home made versions I've tried. Worth buying because it works with little fuss. If you don't sprout because it's a bother and a hassle, this may make the difference between growing sprouts and not growing sprouts, so just do it! Try clover or alfalfa first because they are easiest to grow of small seeded sprouts."
4,"Easy Sprout Sprouter - 1 set,(Easy Sprout)","Easy Sprout Sprouter - 1 set,(Easy Sprout)I am using it for broccoli sprouts. Works well, but always has about 1/5 of the seeds that do no sprout. This might not be due to the design of the sprouter, but the quality of my seeds. Over all I am pleased."
4,Prepare in case of emergency,"If you find yourself in one of the areas where there is a national emergency, it is good to have prepared in advance. This product along with a mix of seeds that includes Chia will allow you to grow high energy food in a hurry. It is suggested that we prepare by being ready. Go to www.ready.gov and see the list of things that will help you get through those first days when the government workers cannot get there. Prepare to help yourself and others with this product."
3,"okay, not exactly ""easy""","This sprouter is cheaper than those found at my local health food store and works well, but it's still a hassle to use and clean. After losing interest in making sprouts because of the hassles involved in this set-up, I'm considering the Tribest Automatic Sprouter, which is available from [...] for a bit less than on Amazon."
4,Fun product!,"I was having problems finding good sprouts locally at the grocers so thought I'd try growing my own. Easy Sprout made it EXTREMELY easy! With the investment of just a few minutes a day, we have fresh delicious sprouts. The price is reasonable and the product well made. The company that makes it, SproutPeople.com, has some great information about it on their website, including several videos to show you just how easy it is. I definitely recommend giving it a try!"
4,Pricey but good,I like this unit but is rather expensive and I can produce more with the easy sprouter. The only thing I like better is that you can de hull with this unit. Rinsing is great with this unit and I would have gone 100% with this if it had not been for the price.
5,Amazing product,This is the most easy way to sprout... Love it.. Is very useful if you don't know how to sprout.
5,Seed Sprouter,This seed sprouter works great! I sprout seeds for my birds and the birds love them! Plus the sprouted seeds are very healthy for them. It's so easy to use!
4,makes sprouting a snap!,Super easy and the directions that comes with the easy sprouter advocates no rinse sprouting. So I instead of not rinsing at all I cut down rinsing to once a day instead of the usual every 12 hours and I been loving the resulting sprouts. And I also find it true that I can sprout more than the usual table spoon of seeds. Depending on the seed type I usually use about 1/4 cup. I haven't had a bad batch yet. It's been great. The only thing I wish is that it isn't made out of that thin plastic material.
4,Need better instructions,As a novice I found the directions obscure and unhelpful and had difficulty with my first try. Only after reading other reviews did I comprehend how to do sprouting.
3,sprouter,I've used this twice and it worked ok. Not really any better for me than just using a mason jar though.
5,Great Sprouter,"This is a well made sprouter. I got very good results first time out.The thing that sets this sprouter to the for front is the convenience of maintaining the sprouts as they grow.No mess or fuss of dealing with trays etc.Very easy to drain the sprouts. The sprouts are kept at the right humidity yet not dry.Put about 3 tablespoons of seeds in the sprouter and you end up with about a pound of sprouts.As far as the parts I had no trouble figuring out how to use it.Look on youtube for demo's.So if you want a sprouter that works, and is easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of space. Get this one."
5,Massively Entertaining!!!,"A great summer read or any other time of the year. It's the best book I've read in a long time. Some of the dialogue was a bit impenetrable at first but once you get used to it the book has a great many pleasures. The part with Orla, the shoelaces, and the parrot was hysterical. I agree with the other reader who said this would make a great movie, just film what's in the book. Only an idiot could make a bad film from this."
2,"Good, but not all I thought it'd be","I was very excited about this product, given the good reviews. However, I found that refilling the pencil took so much force that I was afraid I'd break it. Even worse, the eraser is useless, due both to the design and the material. If I could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better, this would be a much better product. If I have to carry this plus a separate eraser, it's not really saving me much.Oh, and the highlighter isn't a marker. Maybe I'm stupid, but I assumed it would be. It's just an orange ink pen, which is not the same as any other highlighter I'd choose to use."
5,"It passed the test with my ""pen fanatic"" husband!","I bought this pen for myself ... I'm an accountant and love having the pencil, and three colors of ink (one bright orange for highlighting) all in one unit. My husband saw this pen, and couldn't believe I didn't order him one, so I'm back ordering another!"
2,"Good engineering, poor performance.","I work in field of surveying and I need a multi-pen that works in all types of weather and temperatures. When I received this pen, the highlighter did not work, and I found it hard to load the 0.5 mm lead into the pen. When I first took the pen into the field, the lead would break into small pieces and make writing hard, and the tip of the lead pencil would constantly come undone inside the pen. I found it extremely difficult to keep up with the movement of the field crews as the pen required constant maintenance. The black pen finally failed and I no longer use the pen. I also found it extremely difficult to reload the 0.5 mm lead. If you are looking for a durable, long lasting pen, for outside work, this is not a good choice."
2,A quest for the perfect fast multipen,"Well my pen did work. I think how it uses ""gravity"" to switch between pens is neat but its also slow and awkward. I want a multi pen that is faster to use than using two pens. So far no luck.How the ""gravity"" switch works. You hold the pen parallel with the floor. Rotate the barrel so the label of the pen type you want is facing up. Then push the plunger. Then push the release button. Hold horizontal, Rotate again and push the plunger to get a different pen. To many steps for me to fast enough.Also the ""highlighter"" is more of a bright orange ball point ink pen. Not one of those soft tip ones."
4,A Great Guide to tourist spots in the area,"Just what you want for a travel guide. It tells you about many things you might want to see, and gives you detailed directions on how to get there."
2,What's thepoint,"I purchased this CD thinking (hoping) it may be as interesting as Bang On A Can's humanising of ""Music For Airports"".Pretty disappointed - not that it's shoddy work, just a case of ""why""? Straight copy of the original, which itself is brilliant and a 'must have'. This just doesn't add anything new or noteworthy, and pales into insignificance when compared with the original."
4,Cool Debut by Important Electroclash Group,"Adult. does it a little harsher and more old school than the likes of Ladytron, but that doesn't mean the songs aren't accessible. On the contrary, the songs have fun beats and solid synth hooks. There are no sweeping textures or multilayered pieces; Adult. writes songs that are direct and minimal feeling like music from some formulaic stage of electronic music that never actually existed. The vocals, as one would expect, are dispassionate and robotic though more distorted than the norm in this scene. ""Hand to Phone"" is perfect for the dancefloor. ""Minors at Nite"" is a bleepy, analog stomp. Other standouts include ""Pressure Suit"" and ""Dispassionate Furniture"" (nice title).The album is highly recommended for fans of electroclash and industrial but probably not for techno/Ibiza pinheads. I think there would be an odd appeal for fans of punk too. If Devo were still making music and had a girl lead singer, they'd likely sound like this."
2,Striker 2 strikes out!,I bought this for a gift. The idea is right-on. And everything works well until you shoot the missles. The fun stops there -- first there is a longish wait before the firing mechanism releases and then the missle only travels about 3 feet. Too bad!
3,The world is safe from attack by these missles,"We purchased two launchers to use as part of a demo, and I must admit, I am somewhat disappointed. The mechanism used to ""launch"" the missiles is very slow (a motor driven cam), and they are lucky to shoot 6 feet. They are propelled by a VERY weak spring. The location that the laser points to has little correspondence with the missile trajectory. Having a software driver available is nice, and the ability to buy spare missiles is fine, just don't expect much from the actual firing mechanism."
3,Marginal,"A co-worker gave this to me. He had received it as a gift, and it sat on the shelf in his office unopened. Well, I was pretty excited to open it, and it hooked up easily enough. But as the others said, the missles take some time to launch, are rather loud in the lead up to a launch, and don't fly all that far (though, truth be told they can fly from my desk out of my office and hit the wall on the other side of the hallway).My big concern is one another commentator pointed out - the machine moves left to right, but it won't go up and down. That works out fine as its set to fire at a 45 degree angle. But part of the coolness is to see it move on the desk. It would be much cooler if it went up and down."
4,Entertaining,"The book, Danger.Com @2// Firestorm, was an exciting novel. Children solving terrorist attacks on none white nationalities because the child was on a chat line. The author, Jordan Cray mad this book very exciting and was able to expand the imagination for the youthful children of the world."
5,Two Thumbs up to...,"Firestorm, The Best Book I've ever read and believe me I've read alot of books. I recomend this book to any 9 year olds and up. I just started Gemini7 so far its really good too. I hope you will try some of the other books too. Alex C."
5,I thought the book was great,I thought the book was very well written and discriptive.I'm 11 and I love to read.I definitely would reccomend this book to anyone my age. I could picture everything in my mind. This was the first Danger.com book I read and it made me want to read more. I have now read 5 danger.com books and they all are great!
5,"GREAT BOOK, PERFECT FOR PEOPLE WHO ABSOLUTELY HATE READING","This is a great book for bums, like me, who sit in front of their computer all day. TRUST ME ON THIS SERIES!!! I loved them and I pretty much hated reading before I bought the first Danger.com. Every time you read a ne Danger.com, you think that was the best. I can't really rank them, but #6 Bad Intent was definatly the best. LOTS OF SUSPENSE, and MYSTERY!!!!!! JUST READ IT!!!"
5,A modern take on Japanese Taiko drumming,"In ""Asian Drums"", the non-stop pounding of ancient Japanese Taiko drums is combined with a lush, brooding soundscape created by modern synthesizers. Composer and keyboardist Kiyoshi Yoshida handles the digital end of things, while Wakon, a group of Taiko drummers, provide the primal, deep-voiced rhythms. Occasional breaks from the drumming feature other traditional Japanese instruments, such as the shamisen (a plucked, banjo-like instrument), fue (Japanese flute) and bell, adding color and distinctive cultural character to the album. The resulting blend, which flows and blends together like a well-engineered movie soundtrack, is striking, driving and full of intrigue. More of the same can be found on the Yoshida's follow-up recording, ""Asian Drums II"". Another Japanese drumming ensemble which sometimes incorporates modern fusion elements is Kodo."
4,Fascinating,"A broad mosaic of Greek life in the turbulent 1960s. It really captures the flavor of the times, especially the hopes, aspirations, and failures of everyday people, in a very avant-garde fashion. I only gave it four stars instead of five as I felt that the lovelorn column letters repeated some themes too often."
5,As good a book as there is on the topic.,"Let me say first I've sailed with fitzgerald, so I'm biased. He's as good a sailor as any. thats the straight dope. that he and his organization give away sailing lessons for free is testimony enough. Yeah, the books are a little rough, but useful, they weren't written for the public. If somebody wants to pay fitzgerald to write a nice glossy book with pretty photos, I'm sure he'd do it. Otherwise he'll just laugh. he does a lot of that.You all ought to buy this book for no other reason than to support the Oar Club Project. Be sure you look at the website."
2,Wait for the edited edition,"While Fitzgerald's approach in his book may be inspirational and novel, as other comments have indicated, the book is a poor excuse for professional writing. Grammar errors abound. Errors on every single page make it difficult to accept that this book was taken as seriously as the author takes the subject matter (""pure"" sailing). If you value the English language and writing (or rather editing) as a profession and means of communication, you'll be disappointed with the presentation of the material in this book.Furthermore, diagrams would be extremely helpful along the way in this book, but the complete lack of any visual aids furthers the feeling that the time devoted to this book was inadequate.Be aware that you are buying a first draft of a potentially great book. Barring the technical issues, the general idea of the book and the specific application of that concept is encouraging. If possible, buy the book used so that you don't have to pay the cover price."
3,This book made my head hurt,"I take no issue with the information in this book. It is both comprehensive and interesting.The problem I have is with the endless editing and writing errors. As a well-read and literate person I found Fitzgerald's do-it-yourself approach to sentence structure distracting to the point that I would frequently need to set the book aside. For someone who used most of a twenty page introduction bashing ""motorsailors"" and harping on the need to sail correctly or not at all, Fitzgerald (or better yet his editors) should apply his own advice to writing. He should clean this text up so that it can be read by intelligent people."
2,A dream,"The book is full or dream like writing, it lacksany practical advice. Save your money,read something else."
2,Makes my head hurt too,"This book needs an editor and a proofreader, or at least use of a spell checker. As I am not yet a sailor of a small craft, I'll assume that the information is correct. I found the cuteness of the ""style"" to be tiring. Clean it up and the 2nd edition may prove to be a wonderful book."
2,Music and perfornance wonderful; recording defective,"The music is fine; the performance is Glenn Gould, and he plays brilliantly . At least five stars. However, at three or four places on each CD,there are loud bursts of static. I replaced one set; the second was similarly afflicted."
2,Not a great buy,"I bought this printer with the thought that it would be an easy way to print photos directly from my camara. I've owned the printer for about 1 year and now it won't read either my 256 MB or 2G memory cards, also the PictBridge isn't working with my camara either, it just freezes. Since you can't connect this printer directly to your computer, I am out of options I guess. I have a very expensive paper weight.When I was able to get it to work, the pictures were of disappointing quality. I even went back and bought the Lemark paper specifically, thinking maybe that was the issue.So all and all I would not recommend this product. I would suggest finding a printer that prints directly from the camara as well as from the computer."
3,Not as good as I expected....,"I purchased this printer for my daughter to use with her digital camera. Set it up the first day, and it does not read any memory cards. Only way to use it is to hook the cable directly to the camera. Will probably have to return this printer. Photo quality is ok, but certainly not spectacular!"
4,Possibly received wrong brand?,"I recently ordered this item and was possibly sent the wrong brand. It didn't say 3M or Scotch anywhere on the roll or packaging. The brand was Tartan. I was informed by another person that ""Tartan"" is a 3M brand but I myself couldn't find any further info about it. So far the tape works but who know's what the future hold's. :)"
4,Damn this is good,"Haven't listened to anything else for days ... I've been pressing it on my friends, we all agree - this record is a beautiful thing."
2,Pilot VBall,Difficult to use - tried it and could not use it well enough to write efficiently and clearly - I don't recommend it.
4,Dress for Diana - a review,"Book arrived, via a friend in the US (not postable to Aust) and although the cover was a little scuffed, for the price, not bad. Love the book; just what I was looking for, and although I have only peeked through, I can tell it will be helpful in the research I need.A great memento of a happier time for both Diana and myself. Thanks :D"
1,Did not fit,Amazon part finder confirmed that this part would fit my 2008 Honda Accord. IT DID NOT!!!
4,A so-bad-it's-great 'Sixties classic,"Sonny Bono's infamous, self-indulgent psychedelic-kitsch ""classic"" solo album, from 1967. This edition, on Collector's Choice Music, only includes the five original tracks from the 1967 LP. It does NOT also include all the bonus tracks that were included on an earlier Rhino Handmade release. The CCM version has five songs on it. They are: ""I Just Sit There,"" ""I Told My Girl To Go Away,"" ""I Would Marry You Today,"" ""My Best Friend's Girl Is Out Of Sight"" and ""Pammie's On A Bummer"" ...And they are pretty funny, in a painful, ""The 'Sixties were so kooky"" kinda way."
5,Customer service as it's BEST!,"Dragonfly customer service has been absolutely wonderful to work with. Their timely responses and personal one-on-one care has been a breath of fresh air. The Dragonfly company truly lives up to the pride in ownership that seems to be lost with most online companies. I have great respect and confidence in them and their products.As a teacher in the Art of Stained Glass, Glass Eye has allowed me to open a world of original designs aimed at beginning students. The software is user friendly and my students can start creating thier own original patterns right away. It is so nice to be able to teach them HOW to design and then be able to produce the piece. The amazing array of glass samples is outstanding! My students just marvel at the details within the program and the ease of use. They cant' get enough!Once again. Dragonfly has great customer service for a great user friendly product. A BIG high 5 for Dragonfly!-- Cheryl Hall of Glasworx in Sanford, Maine"
2,Buyer Beware! Don't Lose Your Dongle!!!!,"The software is wonderful, BUT...I have (had) the premium edition ($1,200+). During a recent move, through no fault of my own, my dongle for the software got lost. They told me that I would have to pay another $1,200 to replace it. I'll do my designs in Illustrator from now on and will never do business with that company again.In this era of secure digital registration, there is no reason to require a hardware security device.To Glass Eye; you've just lost me as a customer, and as many other people I can advise against buying your software."
1,Cheated,I had been using the demonstration edition of this software for quite awhile and finally decided to upgrade to the standard edition for $150.00. What a colossal waste of money! It DOES NOT give you anything more for the money than the free edition does. How disappointed I was when I finally realized my mistake! Don't waste your money unless you are going for the big and most expensive version! Buying the Standard Version is a complete waste of time and money.
1,This looks like a winner ( sic ).,"All I had to do was take a look at the jacket to formulate an opinion.Two of the photo's are from WWI ( both widely familiar ), left to right, an infantry advance in Flanders, circa 1917, and the remains of a German skeletal corpse in the aftermath of Verdun 1916. The third photo is of a torch-light victory extravaganza, that were commonly held throughout 1933.This is how the producers of this junk present their "" product.""But inside, in 60 minutes, they are going to broaden your horizon on the subject of the Waffen SS. Sure!Avoid this kind of throw-away. If the conjurers' of this stuff can't even locate a real Waffen SS action photo for their cover ( which afterall is the beginning of attracting your money ),do you trust them to say something expanding inside?"
3,Be warned - IT IS NOT IN COLOR,A standard review with nothing new. The description says it is a color DVD. This is not true: everything is black and white.
1,Utter rubbish - do NOT waste your money! (013),"They should be sued for saying it is a colour production, it is not. The only colour is on the cover, along with the photos that have nothing to do with the Waffen-SS. I could go on and on about the errors but why waste my time and yours? Whatever you do, don't waste your hard or otherwise earned money on this rubbish. Honestly, after over 60 years since the end of the war, and we still get stuff like this. I couldn't even sell it after I'd watched it, I ended up giving it away.A disgrace!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This Cr*p,Another slapped together video that foisted upon the public by a cynical and opportunistic publisher. There really is nothing worthwhile on this disc. The historical research is nonexistent and thus the content minimal. Virtually no real images of Waffen SS troops. An absolutely horrid product. If I could give negative stars (-) below zero I would have done so.
1,Look out for HIDDEN FEES!,They whack you for $5 bucks shipping and handling for emailing you the pin.
3,It is does the job...,"However, it really is not suited for more than one teaspoon of loose tea. So if you like your tea strong, or the directions require more than one teaspoon, you would be better served looking elsewhere."
3,Works well for larger tea leaves,"This infuser works well with my Teavana tea because the leaves are large, but does not work as well with other teas with smaller leaves. If you drink tea with smaller leaves, the mesh basket-style infuser is definitely the way to go. I wish I had bought another mesh infuser instead."
4,Nice scooper,"The scooper-clamper aspect is fun and convenient. It doesn't work that well though with some types of tea, like Honeybush or Gyokuro. The little stick bits escape into my cup and then the experience becomes a bit chewy ..."
1,poor??,"simply not what I was looking for. It was intended to be a b'day gift for my Mom. She doesnt know I purchased it, just merely mentioned the movies in the package and said they were pretty bad movies, there have been better selections. It will ge returned."
5,WONDERFUL TRIP BACK IN TIME!!!,"For anyone who enjoyed the 60's and remember a more innocent time (at least compared to the movies out in theaters now); this will take you back in time. Great collection; especially the wonderful scenery in Rome Adventure. Never been to Italy, so watching this was more like travelling with a tour guide! Troy Donahue was such a heartthrob!Well worth the money and will enjoy watching again and again..."
5,"Warner Bros. Romance Classics Collection (Palm Springs Weekend, Rome Adventure, Parrish)","This package certainly deserves a five star rating, because Troy Donahue is such a good actor along with alot of other actors and actresses I like. I would recommend these movies to people who like romance and adventure."
4,Troy Donohue,"Any time I see the name Troy Donohue, my mind automatically goes back to the time I was growing up in the late 1950s and early '60s, a great time with wonderful memories.I saw ""Palm Springs Weekend"" at the RKO Albee a beautiful golden-age theater in downtown Brooklyn, New York. The film holds many pleasant memories and is an all-around enjoyable experience. I even own the soundtrack album with Troy singing ""Live Young."" About ten years ago, I sent Troy some lobby cards, from some of his films, to his home in California. I got them back signed in less than a week.I can't wait to get this set. Now if only we could get Warner Bros. to release some of their classic series from the late '50s/early '60s, including the ones Donohue starred in: ""Hawaiian Eye"" and, especially, ""SurfSide 6,"" one of my all-time favorites. I also wouldn't mind seeing them release Troy's large-scale western ""A Distant Trumpet,"" as well."
5,Romance Collection DVD's,"A wonderful collection of good 'chick flicks!' Although the acting was a little bit artificial, the stories were good and the movies are clean without nudity and foul language. I highly recommend this collection for good old-time romance movies!"
5,WARNER BROS ROMANCE CLASSIC COLLECTION,"IF ITS MOVIES YOU WANT THEN LOOK NO FURTHER HERE IS A WONDERFUL SET AND TROY DONAHUE IS JUST WONDERFUL IN THESE TYPE OF MOVIES . THE PRINTS ARE VERY GOOD AND COLR, ALSO SOUND AND WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT . THE SET ALONE IS WORTH IT JUST TO LISTEN TO MAX STEINER AND HIS ORCHESTRA, IN THE BACKGROUND, HE REALLY MAKES THE PICTURE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES THAT WAS THE REAL REASON FOR MY BUYING THIS SET, WHEN I SEE THAT NAME COME UP ON THE SCREEN MUSIC BY MAX STEINER, I KNOW IM IN FOR A REAL TREAT AND KNOW THIS MOVIE I WILL ENJOY SO IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND LOVE THESE KIND OF ROMANCES THEN I SAY BUY RIGHT AWAY YOU WILL ENJOY THEM NOT ONLY WITH MAX BUT THE SCENES OF LOVELY ROME THIS SET IS FIRST CLASS . PARRISH IS JUST WONDERFUL WHEN IT COMES TO ACTING LIKE KARL MALDOM"
3,Warner's Romance Classics,"Was initially happy to receive this collection in a prompt fashion, and renewed memories of Mr. Daves filmmaking. The problem was, after putting the videos in production date order, we at last came to Palm Springs Weekend.What a dog, neither the established players, nor the young up and coming actors could save this project. The other issue of course was that this film was not a Daves vehicle either.In short, the earlier ""From The Terrace"" should have been included, as it was the beginning venture in the first place. Palm Springs Weekend will certainly be sold to the highest bidder."
1,Love Romance,"Haven't watched yet, saw it in the theater many moons ago.Have to find time to watch my oldie movies soon"
3,Palm Springs Weekend,"This was an okay movie. Think I purchased it in a package of movies from the 1950's. If you enjoyed living during the fabulous 50's, then you will like this movie."
5,Romance collection,Great movies I love all of I'm glad I have them in my collection. I enjoy watching them when ever I want.
5,warner bros romance collection,i always was a person would like the older picturces and i always like the romances one and this collections i always want but couldn't find until i went to amazon and look it up you guys usually have what i want and i really enjoy this collection that stars troy donahue i was born in the 50's so in the 60's i seen the picture and i have like them every since those are movies you can enjoy thamks again for a wide selections of movies
3,Be careful - watch DVDs right away.,"I ordered this and waited to open until I had a group of girls together to watch the movies. What a surprise -- Every Single DVD was Blank. Thank you so much Warner Bros. for nothing. I could not beleive it - all 4 DVDs were blank.I returned the DVDs to Amazon and received promptly replacement DVD's that had the movies. There must have been a glitch in processing the DVD's as the first order I received did not even have the name of the movie on the disc on it this is why I gave this a rating of 3 stars.Since, I was a kid I loved Rome Adventure and Palm Springs Weekend. For this day and age they are dated but it was fun back in the 60's."
4,Baby Boomers,Being one of the first year baby boomers and hitting high school in the early 60's. I see these movies as a sense of the times. Growing up and experiementing with first loves. Exciting times back then. Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette epitomized the kids we were. Anyone who experienced the sixties as young adults would enjoy going back through these three classics. Quality is as good as the theater presentations were then.
5,a blast of the past,I enjoyed all of these movies..it took me back to the early years. the quality was excellent..thank you
2,only for the way obsessed,"I love Sylvia Plath. I think she was a brilliant, insightful writer with an incredible sense of craft. I adore The Bell Jar, her poetry is amazing, and I have read biographies on her as well as her letters home, and I am now reading her unabridged journals.BUT... I found Johnny Panic to be tedious. The stories seemed to be lacking Plath's biting humor, and the journal excerpts were edited, and felt stilted read out of context.I was dissappointed."
3,Not Her Poetry / Not The Bell Jar,"I wasn't disappointed, per se, as much as surprised that this collection didn't live up to the standards I had set for her after reading the collected poems and The Bell Jar. This fault, I assume, lies more with me than Plath's work here. I consider myself a true fan, but I would suggest this only to those of you firmly interested in taking ""all"" her work into account. For most readers, though, the collected poems and The Bell Jar should suffice."
2,Another depressing femdom story,"What is it with writers of femdom? Just like Grant Antrews, G.C. Scott, seems determined to protray dominant women in a sad light. Perhaps it is the British style that is throwing me off, but I do enjoy my BBC. No, I think instead that the reader is left beliving that no matter who dominant this femdom may be, our main male character will evidentually overcome her (or another man will) and shown her the ""true role of women""."
1,Unrealistic and Unsafe,"I gave this book 1 star only because you cant get less than that.I read this book and as it went on became more and more annoyed. It is unrealistic to the point of laughability. For example: Every woman effotlessly had multiple orgasms under this hapless twit of a main character's minimal attention, and the Domina lounged around at home in skimpy leather outfits constantly.The safety issues concerned me as well. People who have no clue about bdsm might think ""Oh, Ill try that!"" and do one of the VERY UNSAFE things he had in the books....ie; hitting someone full force across the stomach...leaving someone alone, in bondage overnight, leaving someone with their arms, wrists, etc bound behind them overnight.This person obviously has no clue and really ought to just go write something where people wont be able to Hurt Themselves from mimicing his book."
2,You should always read the blurb,"I accept responsibility for not understanding what this book was about before I opened it and started reading. That being said, I tried to read it all the way through. It wasn't even the subject matter that drove me away. It was the unbelievable plot and silly characters. I am going to give this book the rating I thought it deserved from my point of view, although others may disagree."
2,Not Well Made,"Clock is cheap with no glass and crooked as well. No way to fix, even though most of it you must build yourself. The paper clock would be destroyed if I tried to remove and replace. Good heavy wrought iron, but wouldn't buy another."
3,Not so good,"Although I love this series, this book seemed to be filler. It could have taken up several brisk chapters."
4,"More of the same, but that's not such a bad thing.","Grass For His Pillow is the second book in Lian Hearn's Tales of the Otori series. It could best (although somewhat unfairly) be described as ""more of the same"". And by that you can take away the idea that a little bit of freshness has gone off the bloom. And that's true.On the other hand, ""same"" is still a pretty high standard. I like how Hearn is developing these characters, particularly Shirakawa Kaede. She's actually turning out so interesting that I find myself annoyed when the voice switches back to the perspective of Takeo. I very much appreciated the author's exploration of the limited role of women in the context of her world.Keep reading, is my advice. I still have high hopes for the series.(Liam Hearn is the pseudonym of Gillian Rubinstein, by the way. It makes me curious to read her children's books.)"
5,Feudal Japan,"Excellent story. The reader presents it very well. Holds your interest. Look forward to more. I you like stories about feudal Japan, you will love it."
3,adventure with more romance then the first,"Mr. Hearn is a good writer. His stories of the Otori are truly interesting and enjoyable. They are pap, but I enjoy that. There is magic in his stories, so you know the good guys will win, but it is still fun to read what happens."
3,Fun and light,"This book reads as light and easy as the first. I alternate between books that take effort to read and ones that just carry you along for the ride. This is of the second variety.Two points:1. The author relies too much on your memory of the first book. I read this one a little over a year after the first and was definitely a little lost, trying to remember specific characters and plot turns from the first book without any real refereshers.2. This is definitely a second in a trilogy book. Just like the Empire strikes back or the Matrix Reloaded, this book felt like mostly set up for the final installment."
1,Grass for His Pillow,"I totally loved Book One. Book Two, Grass for His Pillow was a complete disappointment. The first half of the book was nothing but a repeat of material from Book One. In many instances, it was paragraph and chapter upon paragraph and chapter repeating text from Book One. Book Two was a rip off, I bought and read it based on the quality of Book One, and I was sadly mistaken. I am sorry I got and would not recommend it."
3,Doesn't quite hold up to Nightingale Floor,"Unfortunately, this series take a little downturn after the debut. I guess Hearn's world, as well as her characters, are more fresh and new in the first book. There just wasn't enough here that inspired me. It was still good enough to warrant $10 and a few days of reading."
4,Grass for His Pillow,"I am very impressed with Amazon's great service. The book I ordered was at a great price, much lower than when I went to the store. Plus, it came almost a whole week ahead of schedule. The book is also great. Its a wonderful sequel to Across the Nightingale Floor and a highly recommended read for anyone since it has mystery, fantasy, action, humor, and romance. Great for any age but I highly suggest teens 15 and older to read it.JohnellHonolulu, Hi"
2,Handi-Press Ironing Center,"This ironing board does work, but is cheaply made (though not cheaply priced) and not worth the money. The cabinet is steel and the most of the pieces are riveted together. However, several of the rivets were lose or broken, and the fit of the steel pieces was bad. The door is attached with a piano hinge, but the fit to the cabinet is poor and cannot be adjusted.There is a shelf in the top of the cabinet that in a picture looks like a shelf for an iron, but it impossible to fit a normal size iron on it.I would not recommend this product; it gets 2 stars because it can actually be used even if it irritates me every time. Lee Valley sells a wood cabinet with swiveling board for a considerably lower price; I would get that if I had not already bought this."
3,Expensive for what you get,"This volume contains 75 pages of crucial information about the big three. It also contains inane pictures of a ""green-toed [sic] sloth,"" an amazon parrot, a hybiscus, bouganvillia,and a statue of some people somewhere. There are also several pages of detailed resort descriptions that lend the book a distastefully commercial air.The information about bonefish, tarpon, and permit is of high quality, but it seems diluted by empty glitz and commercialism. Take that away, cut the price in half, and you have a good value."
4,A Harrowing account of Witches in Old Salem,"This is a captivating detailed account of the witchcraft trials in Old Salem. It tells about events leading up to the allegations made against the various suspects, and the strange role of Cotton Mather, as well as many other sub-plots relating to the long saga.For anyone wanting to learn the involved historical background, as well as a lot of speculation about it, this seems as if it has been well researched. It is a gloomy time in that era, and there is not much in the story that is uplifting. I certainly would not recommend it as youth or young adult reading!"
2,Good?,The book I received was in poor shape. It was clearly water damaged with a warped cover and was in poor to fair shape overall.
4,Cleans Glass,"Not nearly as abrasive feeling as I expected, it works well to clear accumulated smog, tar, wax, etc, from windshields. Didn't quite give me the brand new glass clarity I hoped for my ten year old car, but it does go way further than any typical spray on cleaners."
3,Not what i was expecting,"It works i guess but not as easily as i wanted it to because its tells you in the title that its ""No Touch Auto Glass Stripper"" so i was expecting that i would just put it on and it would do the work on my windows to get rid of the water stains but no I ended up scrubbing really hard to get rid of the spots and it still didn't work that geat as i wanted it to. I thought oh I'll just put it on and then do a little scrubing or let it sit and then just rinse it of and the spots would be gone but that was not the case at all."
5,Works,"I've been using this product for several years now, it's easy to use (wipe on wipe off) and it works great."
1,Slowest shipping ever,Took 4 days to give the order any attention and ship. Another week after that to arrive.Slowest retailer ever encountered on amazon.
5,The Temptation to tango: Journeys of Intimacy and Desire.,"Tango appeals to the very core of our emotional and primeval instincts of dominance and surrender in a most elegant and seductive way. The Temptation to Tango by Irene Thomas and Larry Sawyer leads the reader into this magnificent and mysterious world of intimacy in the eternal game of sensuality. Irene has first hand knowledge of the process of learning Argentine tango. Her essays are most informative in a beautifully crafted and unpretentiously terse prose. Larry's vignettes show us the raw emotions and the obsession of the tango dancers, constantly looking for and craving that magical tango moment. Together, essays and short stories present a multi-dimensional view of this magnificent cultural phenomenon. This is a must read book for everyone, especially, for those who are curious about that dance that the initiated cannot live without. Kudos to Irene and Larry!"
5,"Style, Function and Sex Appeal All in One","These briefs stretch in all directions, therfore they fit perfectly to your body. The lower rise makes them a great pairing with today's trends in jeans specifically on the club scene. Along those lines, the material ensures that you will not accumulate sweat in this important area. All of that, plus they look darn sexy. An all-over wonderful product!"
5,How Finding Nemo and Star Wars follow same basic plot points!,"The films Finding Nemo and Star Wars are broken down into Sheridan's 40 basic plot points.As finding Nemo is deconstructed using many of the techniques discussed earlier in the class DVDs, my understanding of the ""classic"" structure of story became clear. THis DVD pulls all the information together. I just saw Toy Story 3 and the same 40 plot points were used almost in the same order! I am starting to see these plot points in EVERY movie that I see (that is any good.) This DVD shows how GREAT scripts/films adhere to the 40 basic plot points-- whether it's a children's movie, or an epic classic.Excellent for using in a Deconstructionist or postmodern course such as my class Cinema and Subjectivity. Allows the students to see clear examples of the 40 plot points."
4,Gritty and to the point.,"If you ever have a insomnia, I would recommend this book to you. However, that aside, as far as information on the IEEE 802.3 standard, this is a good book to start with. It covers in detail: Standardization, OSI, Networks (LAN, MAN, HSLAN, etc.), IEEE 802.3 and ISO 8802-3, CSMA/CD, MAC and LLC (LLC to a lesser degree obviously), internetworking elements (transcievers and the like), cabling issues, 100 MB (802.3u), engineering, bin-hex conversion and HR concerns. A very thorough if dry book. Gave it a four since it missed some important elements such as 802.3z (Gigabit Ethernet) and encapsulation with other areas of the OSI model (eg application layer and routers). This book is primarily a LAN reference."
3,bauble mess!,It's possible that my 2 1/2 year old is WAY to young for this toy! She likes to take the pieces and throw them every where. She has a hard time getting the small hole to go through the rope so for now we are putting this away until she is a bit older for now its a PAIN!!!
4,This is my workhorse pen.,"I use this pen nearly exclusively for the following reasons: (1) The base provides a comfortable gripping surface, (2) the cap stays on tight, (3) it is reliable, (4) it rarely makes ink globs."
1,Hand Piece melted,I'm not sure if it was the game or the batteries but the handpiece completely melted with the batteries in it. It was smoking and scared my son very much. It's very disappointing because he just got it this morning for Christmas.
1,Broken in 5 minutes,"Within 5 minutes of use, the elastic strap on the hand controller broke due to very poor workmanship -- (made in China), rendering the controller useless. Item is being returned."
3,Works fairly well,"I bought this for my son when he was 5 and he still plays with it occasionally. He mastered the controls fairly quickly, but only played with it for a few hours before he became bored with it. It's still held up well and nothing has broken on it yet, even with some abuse."
1,Very User UnFriendly,"I purchased this game for my 8 year old grandson for Christmas. He's excellent with all the other video games, but this game was difficult for him at the beginner level. The first level is just endless climbing with nothing to indicate if you are getting anywhere or nearing the end. You are supposed to be able to move from one building to the other, but we couldn't get that to work. My grandson was never able to get into the game because of the difficulty of the first level. Also the controls don't seem to work properly. This game looks cool, but needs some serious redesigning before it will be friendly enough for kids."
2,Convenient but poor motion picture playback,"I'm not going to talk about the convenience of 300 disks in one vault. That's obvious. My complaint is that complex scenes with motion, particular motion in the vertical direction, degenerate badly. It's truly embarrassing given that my kids' Playstation 2 offers better video from DVDs.Specifically, complex textures look as if they have not been antialiased. They shimmer and stutter as they scroll past. Since this is something that will irk me every time I use the device, regrettably I'll be returning it and getting something else."
5,Good machine - in comparison - still lacking usability!,"I have several DVD players and the picture quality and sound on the DV-F727 is very good. The lack of usability actually comes with loading and maintaining the disc inventory.It is NOT STATE OF THE ART, that for the TITLE as well as for ONE ARTIST there are just 12 characters, despite the GUI interface and the mouse and keyboard. I do like this product, but it obviously never went through some USABILITY testing. I can only hope that there will be some software upgrade available. I seriously recommend the product, but be aware that the nice part - the disc database is MORE THAN LIMITED."
1,Pioneer has DISCONTIUED this product!,"I TRIED to use/enjoy two of these to no avail.The first failed after four years via main IC board failure,the second after 18 months,same thing.Pioneer was absolutely no help.Now Pioneer has discontinued this product.Over one thousand bucks bucks down the drain!Fool me once,shame on you.Fool me twice,say goodbye to all my future business Pioneer!"
3,"I love it, when it works.","I have a huge DVD collection. So I decided to buy thisDVD changer. And for about a year or so I was in heaven.Not having to search for A DVD around the house was great.The only problem with this changer, and most peoplewill not have this problem, but alot of people have.Is it just randomly stops reading your DVD's.So I would keep that in mind before purchasing this dvdchanger."
2,"without the ability to play MP3 discs, it is all but useless","Title says it all. With so many folks either recording their own play lists and downloading their music, any player without the capability to play them is obsolete."
2,Not a replacement for Sony Jukebox CD Player,"Hoping to find a replacement for the recently failed Sony 300 Disc Jukebox Player; this alternative was tried. Wanting the Title Editing feature, it was too complex to use. Returned it and now have another of the Sony product.It is working fine.The novel addition of DVD Play seemed good but was not needed nor wanted."
3,Not too bad.,"Its an alright book, the only thing I dont like and doesnt really help is that most of the cases that are talked about in here are Drug cases. Its hard to get an insite to other cases that are NOT about drugs. But it does help a little. I wouldnt have paid the amount I did for this book had I known this before."
2,Misrepresentation of product,"This item is listed on Amazon as a ""Brother TN-250 toner cartridge"" to be supplied by Abacus-24-7. However, when the order was filled, it was filled with a ""compatible"" toner cartridge. I paid extra thinking that I was getting an actual Brother toner cartridge. A phone call to Abacus was handled politely, but they claim that the ad represents it as ""compatible"". It does not."
5,Ranks as one of the best cook books I have read,"I am not a vegetarian. However, this book by Kurma Dasa has altered my preconceptions of vegetarianism.Kurma has done his research. He not only shows you how to cook but shows you how to blend the spices for the authentic Indian taste. It has a wealth of information even for folks who might think they know what is Indian cooking. The glossary with photos of spices and herbs will help those who don't know how to navigate their way through Asian grocery stores.The book concentrates mostly on Indian vegetarian recipes but has many dishes from other parts of the world as well. One of the surprise packages in the book is ""Juicy curd steak"". Try it, it's good. Try 'em all, you'll embark on a saporific journey of ethereal proportions."
5,Life is changed with this book,Outstanding vegetarian recipes.We are Indian and we find these recipes better thanany even the traditional recipes we have.Our life is changed with this book (and there is another book by Kurma Dasa)
5,Real old school horror!,"I saw this film for the first time as a young girl, and was scared to death! I had a vivid imagination, and that's what you needed when you watched horror films back then. They just dont make films like this anymore! Watched this on FearNet today and wanted to purchase it, but it's not on dvd. Mia Farrow is great, and the film stands the test of time!"
5,Perhaps One Of The Best Creepiest Theme Songs Ever!!,"Never mind the excellent movie - ""The Haunting Of Julia"" (a.k.a. ""Full Circle"") has one of the creepiest opening and main theme songs ever featured in a movie! This one came on TV when I was a kid one night, and the song has really stuck with me, as well as the movie. Enough of the song, this movie is a great example that you don't have to have expensive and fancy computer effects to make a movie scary. In a way, I kind of pity today's teenaged kids who only know a scary movie by virtue of it's computer effects and not it's story, mood or narrative. I'm sure all of us ""older"" folks have stories of when we were kids and we stayed up one night on a Saturday night and a scary movie came on one of the UHF channels to chill us all to the bone!"
4,"make some popcorn and get some cokes,your in for a goodnight","if you and your significant other don't have anything planned for the night, I recommend this movie for a entertaining evening. although, I do reccommend that you get the whole series. this movie is both scary and funny. if you like friday the 13, you are bound to enjoy this flick."
4,Sleepaway Camp 2 is the Best!,"Sleepaway Camp 2, and the Sleepaway Camp series are my favorite movies. The dialog in this film is so funny that there is no way that you will not laugh at it. It will either make you want to visit a real sleepaway camp, or never go to one. This movie is very entertaining, I have seen it many, many times and I still enjoy watching it."
2,Goodnight Viewers,"What can I say? This movie was just dull, with some borderline comedy thrown in so it could try to pass itself off as a spoof. Just stick to the original, which is a genuinely enjoyable B-movie."
4,I was a happy camper,"I love slashers in the woods.Shame,that films like this doesnt exist anymore.With 80's actors that you must love,beautiful camp,sun and inventive murders,you can watch this film over and over again."
1,not the best,not a good movie!!! they shood have a remake a remake starring Fillisa rose!!! {the original sleepaway camp!]
4,Another Pretty Good 80's Slasher!!!,"I have not seen the 1st one yet, so stay tuned for that review! This was a pretty good sequel! Angela, the sexy transsexual killer is back killing naughty campers at Camp Rolling Hills. Whoever doesn't listen to her, ends up dead. The gore and death scenes were very creative! If you love horror, gore, and transsexuals, you'll love SLEEPAWAY CAMP II: UNHAPPY CAMPERS!!!"
2,Too much comedy for me,"If you were expecting a real cheesy, humor-filled horror-fest with the first Sleepaway Camp and didn't get what you were looking for, then don't worry, because Sleepaway Camp 2 brings all those elements into the mix, and gratitutous sex and violence are present throughout. And if you're a big fan of comedy-horror films, you're in luck. But it does have one common thread from the first film, which is the death scenes are pretty cool. My personal favorite is the ""crapper scene"", as I like to call it! As for the storyline, its really not that bad, but don't get your hopes up..there is no shocking ending like that of the first film. I'm just kinda disappointed that they chose to go in this direction after the first movie. I'm not a big fan of comedy-horror movies, especially when its a sequel to a more seriously made movie. Again, I liked most of the other elements this movie brings, but there was way too much comedy for me in this one."
4,Just as good as the original!,"There's a new counselor at Camp Rolling Hills just near Camp Arawak named Angela (Pamela Springstein) as the happy campers seem to be dying mysteriously one by one by a psychotic killer.A funny and entertaining sequel to the shocking and outrageous 1983 slasher shocker ""Sleepaway Camp"" is just as good as the original movie! the make-up effects and splatter effects by Bill Johnson are gruesome especially some of the imaginative death scenes like girl drowning in a outhouse and battery acid to the face. Before ""Scream"" parodied the slasher genre there was this movie with spoofs to ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday The 13th"".The DVD has a crisp transfer and good audio with some fine extras like audio commentary, behind the scenes footage and outtakes, trailer, teaser to ""Sleepaway Camp III"" and still galleries."
4,"A Movie Of Blood, Boobs, Drugs, Sex, And Classic One Liners.....","Fun. I love it... that all:). Ok this movie is great. It is the second in the sleepaway camp francize and it awesome!This movie is a sequal to Sleepaway Camp one of the biggest cult films ever! So we have crazy Angela killing teens who don't fallow camp rules... Fun. And there is a lot of bloods, sex, creepyness and more! BUY!Jared"
3,Angela Is Back.................. *YAWN* Again,"Ok well this is a pretty good movie for its time the acting is better than the first in the trilogy, which still in no way says alot about the acting in this film.Well in this one Angela is older and a camp counsellor, so now she is in charge of the poor unfortunate kids and she is not letting anyone get away with anything.This movie is great if you want some tacky one liners and to be scared witless (only of the acting), but all in all it is great to add to your collection :)There are also some references to Angela in the movie that to understand them you would have to see the 1st in the series where she is a kid at summer camp, no wonder she ends up the way she does from the way she was treated there as a kid."
3,Sleepaway Camp 2,"Angela's back, only this time, she is the lead councilor at Camp Rolling Hills just a little ways down the road from her old killing grounds. Now, Camp Rolling Hills is about to become Camp Rolling Heads for any of the unlucky campers that decide to break the rules! Any shred of seriousness that may have been left over from the first film is traded in for gratuitous boobs, blood, and bad jokes in this campy sequel. Angela spends most of her time spouting out silly one-liners when she's not taking stabs at each of the major Horror franchises. Even though Felissa Rose is missed in the lead, Pamela Springsteen's cheery attitude makes her an excellent replacement as the transgendered terror. Angela torches two teens, drills another, drowns one in an outhouse, decapitates a few, and then dices up the rest with whatever other gardening tools she finds lying around. SLEEPAWAY CAMP 2 is a bloody good time with plenty of late-80's cheese to go around!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,Get this one while you can ...,"It seems this text is becoming harder and harder to get a hold of these days. I suggest that if you're interested in Sarracenia that you get a copy of this while you can. The price isn't bad and, while the book is a bit thin, it has a unique coverage of areas you won't find in other books. Definitely check it out and add it to your library of CP books before it becomes unavailable."
5,Salmon and Pineapples! Oh My!,"I love this marinade. I am looking for it here because my Wal-Mart doesn't have it anymore. I use it on Alaska wild-caught salmon, and grill it with some sliced pineapple! Yum!"
4,Better than the title indicates,"I came into this movie with pretty low expectations, and boy was I surprised!Definitely a splatstick film.. tons of blood, gore, and wooden acting. BUT - and this is the key point - it was well done.Sure the VFX are weak. Sure there's no CGI to speak of. But it has the critical HUMOR intact and doesn't take itself too seriously. There were some serious surprises and whomever wrote this worked some good twists into the script. I got a lot of laughs out of the over-the-top stereotypes.Not grand cinema, but worth a rental. Definitely now onmy list of ""funnier thanit should be"" movies."
4,Enjoy it for what it is,"We were looking for a cheesy B-movie to watch, and The Devil's Cock sure fits that bill! In the same category as Attack of the Killer Tomatoes (only apparently with a much lower budget), TDC looks like it was made with love and shoestrings - and a chicken puppet. And some ketchup. And a twelve-year-old with a computer. Anyhow, if you're willing not to take it seriously and just go for the laughs, it's great. The actress who plays Mascara (I'm guessing that's Thirtina O'Blivion?) is terrific, totally chews up the scenery, and you can't help but root for the tough redneck girl who won't let the devil loose in her little town. If you have an hour to kill and flexible expectations, then this might just be the movie for you!"
2,for busy parents with short attention span ?,"This book is not very well-written, and a lot of what is said is actually common sense. It feels watered-down and rush, although I believed it was intended for busy readers for a quick reference. Certainly not all books have to be ""scholarly,"" but the writing and content seem to reflect the author's lack of academic background and credentials (??)There are much better options for books on this subject."
2,"Advise sounds good, but based on what???","Overall, her advise seems logical and in my experience it is probably largely on target. But sometimes I am left wanting explanation or justification and there is no supporting information. It doesn't appear that the author has any special experience or education with child development or any related discipline. It mentions that she has a tween child, but if this is all information only from her own experience, who is to say it is the best or right or ideal way to do things? And if her tween is not out of her tweens yet, then we have no idea if she is even successful! So I am going to look for a book that may be a bit more authoritative. Another reviewing someplace said that good parenting books for tweens are few and far between and I have to agree. If you want to try this book, there are a lot of cheap used ones...."
4,A solid introduction to an intriguing man,"Love him or hate him, John McCain is one of the most interesting and provocative public figures in America today. This book, by Robert Timberg, does a nice job of introducing McCain to the voting public, much of which knows little about this presidential candidate. Timberg's book is short - you can read it in a day - but it is surprisingly deep and well-researched. Timberg's judgement of McCain is positive, although not gushy. You will come away from this book not only with a better understanding of Senator McCain but a better appreciation of his positive impact on our country."
4,a good introduction to a great american,"This is a book which i have had on my bookshelf for 5 years, and have not read until this past month. Mccain is the man i will vote for president, so it was about time i read. It is not a great literary read however i have learned much about this man and my respect for him has grown. Of course since this book was written in advance of his 2000 campaign I would reccomend one of his more updated books."
1,John McCain and the Doubletalk Express,"An especially revealing passage indicates that McCain does not practice what he preaches, hardly a surprise. While he supposedly now supports abstinence education and favors the repeal of Roe v. Wade, previously he supported legalized abortion and clearly does not practice abstinence, by his own admission in this book (his last nite in Rio). Wake up and don't fall for this power-hungry septagenarian. America can do better."
4,prayers for extreme disciples,"Not entertaining, nor is it for the faint hearted. This cd is serious and doubtless a Holy Spirit inspired, pentecostal work. Prophecy and music syncronised well, allowing the hearer to experience what God is definately saying to this generation.I purchased 6 copies for my young adults group after playing just one track. Don't buy this cd unless you want to be challenged about becoming an ""extreme disciple"" for Jesus."
4,Good book,"Overall this book was good, I think it was the best of the series so far but I think that's because by this time we understand more of the characters and how they act. I really enjoyed this book and suggest it to anyone."
5,Great Mapping program,I love the Delorme program and the Earthmate GPS. They work very well. The program is easy to use.
2,My mistake,"This product is not bluetooth, but USB. Either I didn't read the description well enough, or it was not clear in the product info. I didn't need another USB GPS sender, as I already have one that came with Microsoft Streets and Trips. I returned this product because of the misunderstanding."
1,"Not good, and watch for bait / switch software","Bought this unit to provide NEMA data for other than Delorme software (Google Earth). Nope, LT-20 apparently doesn't provide NEMA data, only Delorme software will work with it, so I'm stuck with Street Atlas 2008 that is hard to use and really outdated by at least 10 years. Software came with a coupon for $40 worth of map updates/downloads from Delorme. Nope, that deal is not being honored by Delorme. Also Amazon's product listing states this comes with Street Atlas 2008 *PLUS*. Nope, this is not the case. It comes with the less expensive and mostly worthless standard version, not plus. Could this be ""bait and switch""? Really disappointed with this purchase, and seriously considering returning it."
3,Not for small notebooks...,"I use an Asus Eee PC 900 as a portable and thought it would make a great little GPS. I had to install it over a network because the PC 900 has no disk drive (it's also got a small flash memory which has limitations.) It took forever to load, and it's response is so sluggish I passed my turns and it did not recalculate the route for more than 2 minutes!.... Again, THIS IS NOT DUE TO THE PROGRAM OR GPS!!!, it is the limitations of the computer. The software appears to work well and I will try it in my wife's laptop soon. Many more features are in this software than in my low-mid-priced standalone GPS, even though my Earthmate has 2008 mapping software. Earthmate GPS LT-20 and it's mapping program are WELL WORTH THE PRICE with a normal laptop!"
4,WARNING: GOOD JUDMENT STILL REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE USE!,"We purchased the Delorme Earthmate GPS, along with the ""Street Atlas"" for a long road trip a week ago. The product, with its voice instructions, worked fairly well.So far, our main observation is that it did not distinguish between, let's say, exit ""20-A"" and exit ""20-B"". It instructs you only to make a turn at exit 20.However, after traveling for about a minute or two in the wrong direction, it will recalculate your route and point you in the correct direction.Consequently, as you have no doubt discerned with the use of most other equipment/software, good judgment and common-sense is required to use it effectively.See also:Delorme Earthmate GPS LT-20 with Street Atlas 2007"
3,some kinks,"There are a lot of great features in this GPS.........but it either isn't up to date, or the satellites and my GPs and car are 'out of phase'....thetracking arrows seem to run alongside a road, not on top of it and then the recalculate notice starts...but I like the 3 different zoom maps all showing at the same time. Just make sure you have a back up checking source when using this system, and take the time to learn it to save yourself trouble on the road."
4,Simple but Interesting Illustrations,"I read this book as an assignment in my ""Literature for Children"" course at West Virginia State University. Although the story and the pictures are extremely simple, the story has a good moral and the pictures are really interesting. It is amazing that all of the illustrations (especially the background) are drawn with only a simple line. This is a cute story."
5,Just What I Hoped For,"This is my favorite childhood book. I wanted to get it for a friend.I wasn't sure what ""school and library binding edition"" meant but I took a chance. It was everything I hoped for; brand new, sturdy, hardcover, and affordable. Just like I remembered it. It should live for decades. A beautiful and timeless meditation on the qualities of stillness and observation!"
5,This book Rocked!! THumbs up,"THe Malkavian Clan book rocked. People thought i was nuts. It makes ya think a lot, just as the other clan books. Do they really exist? Using mirrors and backwards writing. It was tough it is the perfect source book for those of you who like crazy but intellegent things."
4,"Good book, yummy!","The book has some cool illustrations, gives a good overview of the malkavian history, and of course is hard to follow because it is based on the essence of maddness. So if you are looking for something concrete, find something else. However, if you are a Vampire: The Masquerade enthusiast, then by all means go for it."
4,Fine tips for fishing the upper Sacramento River and environs,"Lots of details for mainly trout fishing on the upper Sacramento River, even to the points of suggesting where to park, where to walk, and what hatching (fly) are happening when and where."
3,Write stuff,I was excited to find these pens online. These are the ones I always used in the past. What's not to like about a pen?
2,powder stevia,"I did not care for this product, it had a very strong, unpleasant aftertaste. I did not taste that with the liquid stevia."
2,2012 new design is BAD,"I have always used these PaperMate flexGrip pens. However, the latest order I received are not the same as before. Even though on the box they show the original style pen, the pens inside are now changed to the 70% recycled material version). There is nothing wrong with the new pen appearance. The major flaw is now the new ink is much lighter blue. If you liked the original dark blue ink, this will disappoint you.I just went to the PaperMate site, and I confirmed that they don't carry the original pens as shown in the photo anymore."
1,It came smashed up with pens missing,When I recieved the package the box containing the pens was smashed open and looked awful. Then I noticed that two pens were missing from the box also! Unbelivable!! Never ordering from here again! It was actually packaged that way?! What a rip off!
5,Breathsavers Cinnamon Candy - 24 count,They shiped fast.Came a lot faster then they said when orderd.They are hard to find in any local stores.
5,"One of the best pens, ever! - Paper Mate","We were running low in supply so I had to start hunting for a deal. Low and behold there it was on Amazon.com. We used these pens for almost twenty years. We tried cheap generic brands that must have come from China or somewhere outside the US. They were not working out at all. It pays to make everything right here in the good ole USA, no matter what anyone says!I highly recommend this smooth feeling fantastic reliable writing pen to everyone around the world! Hey Paper Mate want a new spokesman?Thanks everyone, get writing with your Paper Mate, today!Paper Mate Comfortmate Stick Medium Point Ballpoint Pens, 12 Black Ink Pens (6130187)"
4,Good basic red pen,"This pen does what it says. It has a rubberized barrel, which makes it a bit tacky to hold. If pens slipping out of your hands is a problem, this will help.The ink does not smear, not even a little. I'm left-handed, so that is important to me. It doesn't clog the tip, so no problems with writing. I don't get any ooh and ah feeling when writing, but it is smooth enough for the money. The red ink is bright and will show amongst a sea of black."
2,Very Small,This product is very small and seems to be more of a choking hazard than anything. I was very disappointed.
3,very nicely made but not much fun for a toddler,"All the adults are impressed with the details in the items of this toy, and I can see an older child appreciating it more so than a toddler. The items are very small, which adds to its cute factor, but my 18 months old uses only the basket to carry other toys she has around."
2,Batman interactive game,"This game is very fun however, there are only 4 or 5 levels so after about the first day my kids lost interest. Each level consists of solely fighting 4-5 ""bad guys"". There is no opportunity to go out in search of items that will help you through out the game nor does it allow you to explore the levels in search of bad guys. Played on easy the game lasts about 10 minutes. I also noticed that the game started to freeze up in the middle of battle and had to be restarted. I must say it was a bit disappointing."
2,"The game was ok, but got boring quickly!","I bought this game for a friend's child and it did not really work that well. When it worked it was only marginal fun, but since it did not work well, he never really played with it. Save your money and get something else! It also took way too many batteries."
3,My son was 8 at the time and it was okay.,"He played with this toy all of 2 weeks. It still works, however, there was so much to hook up that pieces got missing and a wire got lost. He would jump, kick, spin and it would work fine. It just wore him our quickly and he eventually lost interest."
3,Sexy,"I love the look of these shoes, but when I got them the clear band was too narrow for my feet. I haven't worn them and I probably will just give them to a friend or family member."
4,Classic House from a Chicago based label.,"This album offers a nice spectrum of deep house. Sparse vocal samples but loads of texture and build up. Classic tracks from Marshall Jefferson, early Kevin Yost and Abacus make this album a worthy purchase. Great introduction to the Guidance Label when it was really good! Volume two kept the pace."
2,May be okay for light use,"Original, Feb. 2012: Haven't yet tried a waiter's style corkscrew which failed to perform but this one does it's job well. It only looses one star because the foil knife feels just a little bit loose in it's setting but still works fine. Some people may find the plastic handle a bit slick for their liking but it hasn't given me any trouble.Edit, May 2012: Now just a few months later the plastic housing broke at the fulcrum when I was trying to start a synthetic cork. It was used fairly regularly just for home use, probably 50/50 real corks vs synthetic. So that's pretty unacceptable by me. I'm downgrading from four stars to two: if you only use it ""at camp"" for real corks it might be okay."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CORKSCREW,It literally broke apart in my hand the first time I tried to use it.I'm still trying to get my money back.
1,WINE CORKSCREW,Unfortunately this item arrived damaged. I was disappointed but can't give a proper review on it in bad condition.
1,SHAMEFUL AND BLASPHEMOUS!,"Michael Bolton does for classic soul what The Boston Strangler did for door to door salesmen.Just because he somehow manages to sell X-million units of his ridiculous bellowing and caterwauling, his ego inflates even more to the point he thinks it gives him a license to massacre and devastate some of the most revered soul/R&B; classics of all time.If only there were laws against such aberrant behaviors. Whoever signed this idiot should be banished from this planet, along with Mr. Bolton altogether."
2,The American songbook,"This album by Michael wraps up most of the american songbook classics up to the early '70's.I suppose after covering all of those songs for his previous studio albums he wanted to get more than only his feet wet with it.God knows i really like Michael, but these songs cannot get under my skin.Probably a purchase for the die-hard fans only....DRIFT AWAY is the only track i really enjoyed off the whole cd..."
1,HORRIBLE,"I can't believe there was ever a time when i like Michael Bolton. Well after listening to this cd i never want to hear another note out of his mouth ever again. Michael Bolton's ego is so huge as to think he's qualified to massacre classic song. Anyone who has never heard the original versions of these songs will be so turned off after hearing Michael's versions. And would you look at the cover photo of the cd: tell me he isn't marketing to the female audience. What man would even want to look at that cover photo of Michael trying to look ""sultry"" and emotionally deep in that leather jacket and hair that BADLY needs to be cut?? Not me. This cd is just BAD cover versions done by an egotistical guy who thinks his voice is so monumentally great that he can sing anything and have it sound great. WRONG!"
2,Sickening cover,"I guess the songs are decent on this CD, but the cover of the CD is just truly sickening to behold, from a male's perspective. I guess Bolton was skewing towards the female sex of the consumer sector when he conceived of this CD.I'm burning a CDR copy. That way at least I wont behold his demuring visage everytime I play the CD."
3,Didn't quite meet expectations,"In buying this book, I was hoping to get a good history of the York race riots, but the book is really fashioned more as a memoir for the lawyers and journalists involved in the case. If you want more insight into the defense of Charlie Robertson in 2003 or so, this could be an interesting book, as long as you can handle some of the egotism of the author. As a potential historian, this book just did not meet my needs."
3,good but short,I love Delerium and heard it since 2000.It has evolutionate from industrial electronic to pop electronic and trance ambient.This DVD is a concert about the last Deleriun era and is the one i like more.I missed some very good songs and miss some very good female singers that play in the last albums but these two ladies sing very well too.But what i more criticise is the length.Only one hour of concert too short for a band that has create more than 15 hours of music
5,a wonderful collection of music,"This compilation is a great way to get introduced to the music of capoeira. This compilation spans several decades and shows the way the music of Capoeira is growing and evolving. The CD's are set up so that one CD is more of a training style of CD. The arrangements and instrumentation are kept very simple and enerjetic. The other, although still very much Capoeira music, has more arranging and added instrumentation not normally found in Capoeira music to give a more artistic interpretation of the music of Capoeira. Very pleasant to either listen to or train to. Either way, you have two beautiful CD's packaged together that showcase many years of dedication to the art of Capoeira that shows in the quality of the the music."
1,Good Biblical foundation but....,Biblically spot on but it was boring. It was bad quality and like sitting in a lecture. My kids were not thrilled
3,Good information but bad presentation,"I agree with all the information presented in the DVD (God created the dinosaurs along with all the other animals during creation, dinos were on the ark, fossils are the result of the flood, & medieval ""dragons"" were probably dinos). However, most of the DVD time consists of Ken Ham lecturing. He's standing behind a podium with children sitting quietly in rows listening to him. He has a white board behind him. From the cover of the DVD with the fun dinosaur cartoon you'd think this would be geared toward young children. I think it was created for children by people who don't have young children. This was boring even for me let alone for my creation-theory-dinosaur-loving 7, 4, & 2 year olds. 5 stars for content. 1.5 stars for presentation."
2,Doesn't work properly,"I am really disappointed with the quality of these pens. The first criterion of a good pen is that it should write well, and these fail on this itself. Next is the ergonomics etc, which the pen is fine. Looks good. I have tried nearly all the pens from the box and they seem to stop while writing which disappoints me."
1,PENS DID NOT WORK !,BUYER BEWARE . Purchased very similar Paper Mate pens @ Office Depot & they were smooth writing with great ink flow.With these there is minimal ink flow for a FEW SECONDS & then they stop working altogether !
4,Good Writing Pens,Those pens are very good and helps me to write neat. But the refills for each of them didn't go close to all the way to the top to be full. I'm planning to buy more in a dozen package of the same blue and black in fine point soon. Is it okay to have a full refill on them.
1,"Rip Off - would not cover ""normal wear and tear""","I bought one of their service plans for some very nice headphones. Short story: even though it says they would cover ""normal wear and tear"", when the headphones broke, they said they were only an extension of the manufacturer's warranty and as the manufacturer only covered defects, that's all they would.I would never buy this again. If there are defects, it usually happens soon after you buy something. The whole point of add-on warranty is to cover you in case it breaks while you're using it."
3,"Ummm, debatable","Okay, I bought this coverage after reading why I shouldn't. I like ease of mind and live with someone who couldn't change a light bulb without direction. I am not totally sorry as I at least know my investment on my bike is safe. I would not call this a rip-off entirely, but suggest considering the purchase investment versus the need."
5,Hopefully I will never have to use it.,Well they say that this IS THE PLAN.......... if anything happenes to the machine in 2 years they wil fix and/or replace.... Hopefully I never have to use it.........
5,Perfect Seller!,"Excellent Seller, Product(RAM) delivered befor the scheduled date, came in exact size box with invoice, very professional service.Product quality: excellent, installed on dual core computer, and now computer pefromance has improved lot (Previous mem 1GB now its 2GB)Ready to purchase from this seller."
5,"David Ault's ""The Healing Bridge""",Universally spiritual and uplifting sounds guarenteed to remind one of their worth.
3,why get this if you have so many other good scrapers,every thing on the chisel is not finished as well as it should be the handle is but the blade is notwhen using this the blade gives you some hot spotsthis chisel does not cut wheel at all it catches and is not safei gave it three stars because hiw it is for the price it is hssthe other psi scrapers are great but not sharppsi is a high value brand
1,Disappointing,"First of all, HOW ON EARTH could these lunkheads have replaced the original single version of ""I Can See Clearly Now"" with this incredibly inferior ""alternate version"" with new (electronic?) drums and an inferior mix? For that alone this CD is docked two stars. The remaining bulk of this CD consists of unreleased tracks, which, for the most part, should have remained so. Furthermore, calling many of these tunes ""reggae"" is stretching it.My advice: Buy the DELUXE version of THE HARDER THEY COME. You'll get the only Johnny Nash tunes you need (including the original, remastered version of ""I Can See Clearly Now"" - yeah!), as well as the cream of late-60's to early-70's reggae."
3,"Disappointed with the ""alternative"" mix","I didn't realize that the version of ""I can see clearly now"" is a remix with synth drums added. I much prefer the original to this dance mix. The original should have been included on this collection -- so I've docked my rating by one star.Otherwise the album is quite good. Admittedly I'm not a definitive Nash collector, this effort does include my favorites ""Hold me tight"" and ""Tears on my pillow."""
4,Smooth and easy,"Johnny Nash, from Texas, made his mark for all time with his reggae-pop tunes like ''Hold Me Tight,'' and ''I Can See Clearly Now,'' and faded off. But the simple magic of this music still rings today. This ''Reggae Collection'' is among his best. Viva Johnny!"
5,Always a favorite,"Reggae, some R&B. A pleasant, upbeat album with Johnny Nash's gorgeous vocals. My fav cut is the Bob Marley written tune Guava Jelly. I bought this when I saw it as cassette, again on CD and I'll probably buy it AGAIN in the next format."
1,It's like purchasing a high school classroom presentation.,"I'm guessing that this was recorded for a class and just played for them because there are numerous references to worksheets that you won't have.Visually this film is very painful. There's a teacher, a blond woman, who is at the lower part of the screen talking. Her head is green screened behind random backgrounds that make sense for what she's talking about but are not entertaining to look at in any way. Graphically its an incredibly low quality and there's a ton of repeated visuals.She uses good movie references to explain a point, which is about the only plus here.If you need someone telling you about story archs, etc etc You could truly look this stuff up easily online for a list. There is not anything you wouldn't know if you didn't know the basics.These would never and should never be worth 20 dollars!! They are worth about 3 dollars for giving the basics with pictures."
5,I love it!,"I've always had trouble getting interested in excercising, but this video makes me feel good, and I can feel the burn, feel my heart rate growing, it's great! Madeleine is inspiring, she has great motivating words that keep you moving throughoutthe video! I give this video two thumbs up and five stars! I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting out and trying to get motivated!"
5,"Awesome workout, adjustable to fit any schedule!","This is a great workout that will fit any schedule. There are four ten minute segments which can be done separately, altogether or in any order. Madeleine Lewis is energetic and has the motivational skill to make the workout very enjoyable. She is joined by two other people doing these routines in moderate and advanced levels. This is the type of exercise that will work up a sweat without injuring bum knees or over stressing the heart. I've been doing this workout for over a year and still enjoy it several times a week. The setting is also beautiful and has just the right touch to aid in reducing stress. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in a healthy exercise program to stay fit."
5,I love this walking video!,"I purchased this video after trying one of the segments out on a cable fitness channel. It is a great short workout to get your heart rate up and boost your energy level. I like the short weight segments after the walking portion of each segment, especially on those days that I know I am not going to have time for my normal weight training."
1,Don't Get BURNED!,"This is a good workout BUT it is the SAME as two others from Gaiam. If you already have Cardio Walk for Weight Loss or Cardio Burn Weight Loss, then don't buy this one."
2,Not motivating to me,"If you're looking for an intense work-out, this will give it to you. On the other hand if you're looking for fun with your work-out, I don't think you'll find it here. I did not like her cuing and in particular did not enjoy her constant ""grunting"". Some may find that motivating, I find it annoying. I have several Leslie Sansone DVD's and I love her workouts. Some complain about her chatter, I find it motivating. Leslie makes you feel like you can do it and she's right there with you. Her walk kick is a great, just as intense as this DVD but a lot more fun."
4,Not for those just starting out.,"I personally enjoy this workout. I have been doing Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's and was looking for a variation. This workout is a great alternative for someone who has been exercising for a while. I really like that you can do just one 10-minute segment at a time if you wish.If I were new to exercise, I would definitely be frustrated and discouraged trying this DVD. Even the lower intensity is challenging and it's definitely more difficult than Leslie's DVDs.If you are just starting out try Leslie Sansone's DVDs first."
5,Walking for Weight Loss,This video has it all! Madeleine Lewis knows how to keep you motivated and make you push yourself just a bit harder each time. The steps are easy to learn and fun. The cool down yoga type workout at the end is also very good and a necessary part of this workout. I feel great when I am finished.
3,Not bad,"This was an okay workout, I didn't like that it was split into 4 different segments. I prefer the Leslie Sansone walk away the pounds 4 mile challenge to this one.But I'll do this one once in a while for a variety from LS WATP."
5,amazing,"This album has aged amazingly well - whenever I'm in the mood for Fishbone, I put this one on. Although ""Truth & Soul"" is probably their best, it sounds a bit dated today. ""Monkey"" is simply amazing in its breadth, from the crunching metal of ""Servitude"" (which at first I didn't like but might now be my favorite track) to the more melodic rock of ""Black Flowers"" and ""No Fear"", to the straight-up P-Funk style ""Lemon Meringue"", to the fantastic sunny ska of ""Unyielding Conditioning"", quite possibly one of the happiest-sounding tunes ever recorded (though with somber lyrics). This is the last album recorded before the weirdness with Kendall caused the band to turn into the ""speed metal with horns"" incarnation. This album captures that ferocity balanced with the melodic hooks of their previous works. You gotta love it."
4,Get yourself together,Fishbone march to the beat of their own drummer and they are one of America's best live bands. I have high admiration for these brothers . Even though I love Chim Chim's... a lil' more this album has a metallic edge which gives it distinction. They usually begin shows with Swim and I really dig this tune. Lemon Meringue and Unyielding Condition are two well-written and Played tunes as well. Fishbone Rock ON!!!
5,One of my favorite albulms of the 90s,"Most attempts to combine message with music fail miserably, but these are some of the best tunes of the decade. ""End the Reign"" is simply beautiful in its build up from quiet tension to a killer rock release. ""Servitude"" stands out as another powerful song. The other hard rock songs are just jam, jam, jam. ""Swim,"" you may remember from the Last Action Hero soundtrack (bad movie but a good soundtrack.) There's also some funk songs, some people don't like the fact that there's so wide a mixture, but I liked it. When this record came out, I played it over and over hundreds of times."
5,Gotta let your taste buds blossum,This is the most amazing musical talent i have ever heard. These guys are so underrated it is unbelievable. If you want a cd that is everything all the way get this today.
4,"great hard rockin,funk filled fishbone album","fishbone shows that as they mature they can still play funked up music and learn to rock harder than ever before.....""swim"",""servitude""and""lemon meringue"" stand out on this record"
3,Better Live,"New York's Fishbone are one of the wildest, most energetic bands I've ever seen live. A shame that their sprawling array of musical styles (covering anything from hip-hop, ska, reggae, and soul, through to metal) doesn't quite translate in the studio. My main gripe with this album is that it lacks any real coherence, with its song structures going awry on frustrating tangents. There's also too much going on in the songs, resulting in the whole picture being cluttered up. Despite that, the positive message and subliminal melody of 'Black Flowers' and the twisted funk of 'Lemon Meringue' do them justice. But on the whole, this is a disappointment."
3,Disappointed,I gave Fishbone's Give A Monkey A Brain And He'll Swear He's The Center Of The Universe a three because thats the number of songs i liked on the album. There song writing is incredible but the songs fall apart when they bring in the ska and reggea. Servitude Black Flowers and End Reign were the only songs i liked they rocked. But songs like Unyeilding Conditioning really made mad the lyrics are exellent but they just mees it up
4,John Jame's hand quilting needles,I already knew this product but this was the first time I purchased them through Amazon.They arrived perfectly on time and are as good as I knew they were :)Big Eye Quilting Hand Needles-Size 10 20/Pkg
3,Wrong product - ordered by mistake,I thought the pen was retractable - my fault - hard to tell from the photo.
1,Good idea,"It is an interesting book and for the highly keen ELL learner wanting to break down English to the levels that this book does, it may work well. Perhaps there are evem lauhgs to be had, but for example in Unit 1 the learner is exposed to the following idioms: He's a s nutty as a friutcake, He's not right in the head, and She's a basket case.I am not sure why I have such intuitions, but someone keen enough to master 60 units of idioms is probably looking for a bit more in their lessons.I think as a reference book it may be a great book to have, as part of a language learning institutes library, but not essential. Good attempt here, but not sure I would want to use this text, in any way, as part of a course."
5,Great book!,I am using this book in a EFL intermediate course and it is great! The students like using it and they say it is very interesting.
5,Oh Oh What will she nag me about now!!,"I used the large AXE blade and in a couple hours had my old 16 ft fiberglass boat cut up and loaded in the back of my Ford Ranger for a trip to the dump. One blade did the job. This blade cut through nails, fiberglass and plywood and begged for more."
5,What a blade,"What a beautiful blade.Demo'd a vanity top and cabinet. Hate to use the old cliche',but it cut through ""like butter"" and with no effort.I've used the saw many times before but was really impressed with the ""Ax"". Great product."
5,great!,This product was purchased later on after my husband received his saw. He like having variety for different projects. Great price.
5,Blades,"Great variety great price. The storage container is a good bonus too. You can't compete with Milwaukee blades. I would recommend this to everyone and I will be purchasing these again. You can never have too many blades. Spend the money get Milwaukee blades don't try and save money on cheaper brands, you'll thank yourself later."
5,Tough Blades,The blades are not cheap. However you get exactly what you pay for. Milwaukee blades are the best for longevity and ease of cutting. Think about that the next time you buy cheapo or generic blades.
5,Great addition to your sawzall.,These are great saw blades. They always last longer than any other brand I buy. The roll-up pouch is real cool. Makes for easy storage. Price is pretty good considering it is Milwaukee.
5,Extremely tough professional quality blades,"These are the toughest blades I have ever used. I am remodeling an old house. To facilitate installing insulation and wiring I am removing the plaster over plasterboard exterior walls but keeping the ceiling and interior partitions intact. This requires cutting the embedded wire lath corner reinforcement. This task is brutal on blades, a 14 foot long wall requires a cut 30 foot long with the blade plunging past the wire into the supporting wood, not to mention cutting through about 1-1/2"" of rock hard plaster/cement.These blades can take it. They refuse to break. I bend them like a pretzel, lay them on a 2x4, hammer them back straight and continue cutting. I would not have believed this was possible if I had not done it. I don't think you could buy a better blade at any price."
2,Milwaukee demolition set,"The first time i used the Torch blade it went dull after 3 pieces of 1.5"" EMT. The 2nd blade only lasted a little bit longer, but the third is lasting a decent amount of time so not sure whats up. The case is pretty cool though. Havent used the other blades yet so cant comment on them. I think ill just stick to lenox blades"
4,Product name,"This set was named ""Ultimate Demolition"" I wrongly assumed it was just a hype type name. No fault of the seller. I'll keep it in case I need to destroy something, but I will need to get some different blades for every day use"
5,Far Beyond Nuggets,"60s Brit band who recorded under several odd names and are generally, and wrongly, lumped in with the period's garage-rock bands (not that there's anything wrong with garage-rock...) Les Fleurs were a much more polished, professional and groove-savvy outfit; though they never got to grab the brass ring, their collected output shines as some of the most booty-propulsive of the era, perfectly blending rock, soul and psychedelia far better than many of their contemporaries. ""Mud In Your Eye"", ""One Girl City"", ""Tick Tock"" and both versions of ""Hold On"" deliver the goods in fine, spirited fashion - Bryn Haworth's stinging lead guitar forcefully driving most of the material. I bought this expecting it to be good and was knocked out by HOW good it actually is. Pounce!"
4,They Never Made It?!......Must've Been The Name!,"Yes, that's the only explanation for this bands chart failures because the music speaks British psych rock brilliance! I'm guessing some picked up their singles back then, tried to pronounce their name, then put the single back down in frustration. Anyone who loves the Who, Kinks, Creation, Small Faces, NEEDS TO ADD THIS TO THEIR COLLECTION PRONTO!!! I only knew of ""Circles"" and ""Mud In Your Eye"" on the Nuggets Vol.2 compilation, which I both loved upon hearing (their version of ""Circles"" outdoes the Who's version). But this CD will be such a treat to anyone interested in the ""lesser"" bands of this awesome era in British rock. Check it out...I'M GLAD I DID!!!"
3,Heavy Psych and Third-Rate Soul,"This compilation starts out strong with heavy hitters such as ""Circles (Instant Party)"", ""Mud In Your Eye"", and the absolutely rockin' ""Hold On"". This is great guitar-heavy psych stuff, to be sure. These tunes have been available on British Psych comps like the legendary ""Chocolate Soup for Diabetics"" series. The bulk of this comp, unfortunately, consists of pedestrian rock and roll and competent-at-best imitation soul and R&B. Get the genuine articles (Curtis Mayfield and The Impressions, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, etc.) instead."
2,Instrumental Imagery,"This CD was scratched and not up to standard. I was not able to return it on time due to medical issues, however, I think I have learned my lesson re: ordering from Amazon."
3,Underwhelming,"I have to agree with Arif Akhundzada's review below. I was quite suprised, after reading the many glowing reviews here, to find the music on this CD very mediocre and derivative. It left me without any emotional response or lasting impression, just mediocre. I suggest you keep shopping."
4,This is good.,I don't know much about electronic music and I don't know if this is electronic or not. It doesn't matter; this is very pleasing. Soft but with enough rhythm to keep it interesting. Try it.
5,Nice alternative to Yanni,"I must admit, I like Yanni. I find his music very moving, and not intrusive while I am working. I have been listening to this type of music while typing papers for an online class. While looking for more Yanni, I happened upon this artist and I must say I like the music very much. I now have purchased 2 albums.I cannot say anything bad about this music, it is very pleasent to listen to."
1,Misnomer,"This book has nothing at all do to with angels or people who have experienced their grace. This book is an arrogant treatise on Graham's personal opinion that he is ""worth more"" than angels in God's eyes. Attempts are made to legitimize his claim with his self-serving interpretation of the Bible. Unless you are interested in Gtraham's personal opinion of himself, the book is pointless."
1,not useful,"It is just a person talking, and talking...not very useful. No examples (from a-z, not details for cases."
3,Pretty....but,"I really love this set, HOWEVER, within several weeks two knives had broken, and several spoons are loose......So, my advice is to buy extra if you really love it and were naive like me and bought the dishes to match....or if you're hard on flatware (ie.use it every day like I do, and have children), then you may want to pick out a sturdier set. I do want to say that these haven't been washed in a dishwasher, so that isn't a concern in my case. I guess they're not made to be used everyday."
4,Acceptable performance of great music,"F. Schmitt's compositions seem to be difficult to ""mess up."" I had another rendition on vinyl that introduced me to these two pieces, thus I consider any deviation from that to be at least slightly inferior. My rating may not be completely fair for that reason. This belongs in any music collection that is even moderately serious. I must caution younger listeners that in addition to rhythm, this music also has melody and harmony but completely lacks foul language!"
2,Too pricey!,"Their was only 1 strawberry in the package. I was not happy about that. It states this, but in small parenthesis. It was too costly for just one little wooden strawberry."
5,Life Sized Strawberry,This strawberry is beautiful! It is true to life in size and a wonderful addition to any Haba play food set. A must have of all the Haba foods.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD/VCR combo so that I could play DVD, VCD etc. multi format as well as PAL tapes from UK. However, I found out now from Philips Tech Support that it does not play some compact DVD as well as VCD. Their website states that it plays it all in region 1 but now I found out it does not. Hence, I have to return it to Philips and find out if it is a problem with the unit or not. I could play these on my neighbors Panasonic DVD. It is a bummer.HB DVD reveiwer"
5,classic Miss Marple,"The acting is professional and the clues are intriguing--not too little and not too much. An enjoyable mystery, and no sex."
1,Very Boring,Very slow moving story...not very enticing...sound quality not great. We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest. Unusual experience at best.
1,"Beware - not ""band approved""","I was recently browseing the Lunasa site and found they had a new albulm. Joy! Lunasa is one of the driving forces in modern Celtic music IMHO, so I was all ready to rush out and get copy from Amazon. However, the band also mentions (on their site, http://www.lunasa.ie) that they have split from Green Linnet, and that the version of albulm from them is not as they wanted. They offer an ""artist approved"" version for sale from their web site. I suggest you get that instead, at least till Amazon stocks it."
2,Sent mine back to Amazon.,"Even if mine had worked properly (it didn't) I probably would have still sent it back.1) Video from the latest iPod models will not display on the LCD screen.2) The unit protrudes too far from the cabinet if you leave room for the cable connection. My cabinets are standard 12 inches deep and the TV protrudes more than two inches. If your cabinets are deeper this won't be a problem for you.3) Cheap plastic look and feel. For almost $400 it should be sturdier.Mine was also defective - one of the speakers didn't work. However, it's very easy to return to Amazon so I would give Amazon 5 stars for customer service."
4,The Family Loves It!!!,"I installed this unit in our kitchen about a month ago and the whole family has really enjoyed it. TV, DVD, Radio all work great. We do not use the iPod dock. One caution ... it is a very tight fit under standard cabinets. You have to connect all your inputs prior to mounting because there is no room behind the unit afterwards."
2,Not satisfied but the reciever of the gift was,"The color varies greatly by channel. Sometimes looks pale and off tint. The user manual for TV setup functions are terrible. The radio is a pain to set. Can't go direct to a channel to set. Only mfg who had a decent reliability rating. But she liked it for the kitchen as a gift, so she kept it, but I'm not happy with it."
2,Dont Buy for the iPod integration!,"The iPod integration is pretty basic to the point of irritation. Can't navigate iPod Menu on the LCD screen and Can't play video from the latest iPods(Apple to blame here.. but Philips is not doing much to fix it either).The LCD size is too small for viewing from more than 4 feet away.Product is otherwise of good quality... Good Sound, easy to use."
5,under cabinet kitchen TV DVD,Arrived on time. Easy to install. My son and daughter were using the ipod docking station and watching TV in the kitchen before we left. It was great.
4,so far so good,"so far I am satisfied, the item was easy to install under the cabinet, have a good TV signal and audio is what I expected. the DVD eject system is a little slow ejecting, but I can leave with it. I still believe i picked the best one out all the others I researched."
3,DVD opening,"Where is the opening to put the DVD disc? Sounds pretty silly isn't it, but we have not been able to locate it. Ashok"
1,Doesn't light...at all!,I bought a lighter from this manufacturer about a year ago and was pleased with its price and performance. This time around I got the more expensive version because I wanted a bit more longevity from the thing and I needed a spare (I'm always losing stuff like this). I'm very disappointed with this lighter. It barely lights and is completely useless. I've adjusted and filled and cleaned... all to no avail. There's obviously a quality control problem so I would urge you to stay away from this one.
1,The lighter that never lit!,This lighter never worked as I took it out of its box filled with premium butane...I will return it!
1,Nobo Space 6 lighter review,"I'm very disapponted with Amazon. The Nibo Space 6 Triple flame lighter never worked. I sent a customer complaint back in the beginning of August to Amazon and the vendor and as up to date I have not received any response.Again, the Nibo Space 6 Triple flame lighter never worked."
2,Not working,"This lighter lit a few times and now it will not light even with any of the recommended procedures to fix it. I have emptied and refilled the lighter several times, adjusted the flame up and down several times. I would like to return it and get a replacement. Please let me know how to make that happen.Thanks,Bruce Kohl30459 Via VictoriaRancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275bruce.kohl@cox.net"
2,NIBO disappoints,"At the beginning, everything was looking good, I was happy with the lighter. Only a few months later the flame goes out after less than one second, the torches are uneven even when the flame lasts... It has fallen apart and is basically unusable.Do not waste your money, research and buy a better productI have seen similar comments made by users at a cigar cite I use, so beware"
1,won't light,"I bought this lighter a year or two ago, and it only worked for a very short time. I had bought another lighter from this company as well, and the same thing happened... Spend a little more money on a better lighter."
4,Buy this album - now!,"This album was recommended to me... I had seen Matthew Herbert rape a cereal box on german TV once before (he was being his 'Radio Boy' charater) which made me decide to stay far far away from him.However, after downloading the first half of the album, I immediately decided this was definitely one (of many) to own! It's something you'd play after coming home from going out, after coming home from work whilst taking a bath, while smooching on the couch with someone special and even while sitting on your balcony on a mid-summer night.If you wanted to compare this album to something else; think Everything But The Girl's most recent studio album, Temperamental. It's dancey, but not too loud... Very jazzy, melodic. VERY soothing.I honestly don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Welcome to Limousine music at its best,"This is the quintessential chill-out album of 2001. M. Herbert throws you the minimals and leaves you wanting to dance at the same time. From start to finish, this album sets a mood that can go well with just about any occasion."
1,this is horrible! don't buy it.,"i love herbert's earlier work and nearly all of his remixes are sick, twisted, funky, and incredible. he is an incredible artist! but this album is full of avant garde lounge music that tries to mix subtle undertones of electronic music into it - and it fails miserably! there is only 1 song (""leave me now"") on this worth hearing and it is not even worth the price of a used CD to get it! i have never been more dissappointed by any artist - much less one as brilliant, skilled and funky as herbert. this album is simply awful!!"
3,"Great housey stuff, but overall very patchy.","Herbert should stick to what he does best, and that is making awesome, smooth, house-flavoured dance music.This album has some tracks that really got me pumping, and show the work of a talented musician behind the scenes, but man, some of those jazz ballads are lacking... they sound ""nice"" and might make good background music for somebody's dinner party, but ultimately, they are totally forgettable, meandering songs which I have heard a million times on a million albums before.Lots of people told me that Herbert is really progressive, but after having listened to this album (carefully, and a few times), I have come to the conclusion that Herbert is pretty old hat."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD,"I was totally diassapointed in D.C. Curry's performance on this DVD. I have to say I think Don D.C. Curry is one of the funniest men on earth, when I saw him live in Atlanta, I thought I was going to die laughing.But his performance on 'Nervous Breakdown' was pitiful, he just did not seem prepared. I've never heard him use as much foul language and unfunny bathroom jokes before. It seemed like desperation to get the audience to laugh-- which most of them didn't seem to be. I maybe laughed once.If I could rate this DVD '0' stars I would, save your money."
3,Out of date.,"Like many other books in this series, the non-local editor, author and publisher all live outside of the state of Arizona. Although frequently reprinted, the trails shown have not been re-ridden in some time. Many are out of date or simply no longer exist. In the meantime, many, many new trails have been developed and are being enjoyed by Arizona Mountain bikers."
2,poor maps,"Maps drawn with a mouse have a generic look and give very skimpy info. When you are in the woods, the devil is in the details. A good, accurate hand drawn map with lots of useful detail is much more useful and fun. I also like a contour profile which shows elevation gain over distance, so that I know what I am getting into before I begin. If you want the local mountain bikers' guide written by a local that does the job right and has the ""real"" rides, get Cosmic Ray's FAT TIRE TALES AND TRAILS: ARIZONA MOUNTAIN BIKE GUIDE."
3,Out of date.,"Like many other books in this series, the non-local editor, author and publisher all live outside of the state of Arizona. Although reprinted in 1996, the trails shown have not been re-ridden for nearly 10 years. Many are out of date or simply no longer exist. In the meantime, many, many new trails have been developed and are being enjoyed by Arizona Mountain bikers."
2,too many roads,"This is one in the ubiquitous Falconguide series, and it has the same virtues and vices of all of them. Virtues: good info on the region, OK maps, OK trail info, good energy. Vices: the author seems to think that mountain biking is done on dirt roads. Almost all of the rides are on roads, and there seems to be a concerted effort to not talk about the famous single-track rides--most of the ST's listed are out-of-the-way oddities. If you want to ride classic single-track, this book is next to useless. Cosmic Ray's book is much better.Two months later: I reviewed this book after I bought it and before I went to AZ. Even then, it was clear that the book is almost entirely about roads and rarely about single-track trails. Now that I know the area, I am appalled. Bennett literally directs you to ride fire roads while ignoring the world-class single-track trails that run right around those same roads! Inexplicable. Good book if you hate single-track, I suppose."
3,"Wow, it's still in print!","I have an old copy of this book. It was old when I got it ten years ago. She doesn't include the national trail, but she covers a lot. She even covers some trails Cosmic Ray (my favorite) ommitted. If you notice the bike on the cover and photos inside, all bikes are rigid. I don't think bike shocks had been invented when this book was published. So, take it for what it's worth. I paid four bucks for my copy ten years ago and I am happy with my purchase."
3,"Ok, but not as good as the Cuisinart","The pot is very lightweight. I don't need a heavy stockpot, but this is really insubstantial. I wish I had gotten another Cuisinart 12-qt pot. Those are perfect. They do cost a bit more, however. This one is all right, I guess. I hope the heat distribution is as good as the Cuisinart, but it probably will not be."
1,Bad Luck,"Although I received the film I ordered, I have yet to receive the novel that goes with it and which I already paid for. I have complained to both Amazon and to the seller, but thus far it's simply bad luck.-nancymoore"
4,So good!,"My mom recommended this book to myself and my siblings. It's life changing perspective helps pin point areas I've struggled with for years, and provides the solution. I've since recommended this book to many friends and loved ones."
5,End of the Line: The Rise and Fall of AT&T,"I had previously purchased this book when it first came out. I was recently reading it for a second time and bought 2 additional copies for friends. As a retired AT&T management employee with over 30 years of service, I felt like the author's account of the characters and events leading up to the fall of AT&T was totally believable and accurate. Looking back and having retired before the collapse, I can now very well see how it happened. Although it makes me sad and angry each time I read it, this book is a very informative no holds barred account of just how bad management, tremendous egos, poor decisions, selfish competing agendas and ineffective communications brought down one of America's greatest companies."
3,An Odd Perspective,"For such a serious subject with grave impact on many shareholders, the author is far too flippant and cavalier. Having read the earlier Brooks book, this carry forward is nowhere near the same quality of verse.Some factual innaccuracies that could have easily been corroborated however also some interesting material on the very brief Walters reign."
3,End of the Line: The Rise and Fall of AT&T,"Not of the same caliber as Ms. Cauley's ""Optical Illusions"", but a good read nonetheless. If you're not part of the the turbulent telecom industry, this is not your cup of tea. A few innaccuracies here and there, but over all it's got the story correct."
3,"Interesting read, but not very insightful","The book hinges on the fact that AT&T's core business, long-distance service, had seen it's best days gone, and therefore serves as the poignant backdrop for most of the book. However, Leslie does not provide any strong argument or analysis as to what AT&T's senior management did incorrectly. Specifically AT&T's board and Goldman advisors had supported every [mis-]step of the turn around endeavour. It seems like AT&T fell as a victim of being at the wrong place at the wrong time, basically trying to shift away from a long-distance business while doing it at the END of one of the biggest booms in history, that of the internet."
5,Eye opening page turner on the fall of an icon,"Written like a good novel and researched in depth, this perspective on the rise and fall of AT&T was not only a fascinating historical piece on this great American corporate institution, but also an expos'e on the egotism and ineptitude of a handful of corporate officers who disregarded common sense and good counsel and brought this great corporation to it's knees."
3,Pedrini wine and bar universal stopper,"I have used these stoppers for a long time...keep an open bottle of champagne ""bubbly"" for up to 4 0r 5 days if you do not drink it all once open...I repeatedly have to get a couple...as once people are aware of them, they want one and I usually give one of mine and reorder...Make a good hostess gift.MST Los Angeles Ca."
4,All the Basics,"Basic Camp Management covers all the basics one needs to know about the summer camp industry, plus new sections that include retreat/conference centers. It is a great resource for both the new and vetern camp director. Any one thinking about going into the camping industry should read this book. It covers everything from finances to programming. The book basically reads like a text book with review questions at the end of each chapter. I would reccomend this book as the most comprehensive resource for the summer camp industry to date. It would also be useful in a recreational sciences course."
3,"Too basic, without enough juicyness","This book is small and cheap, hence the reason many professors use it for anthropology. I was glad when I received it and found it was a small, short book. The information is very basic, almost too basic for the college level. However, it really did quite little to hold my interest. Although the chapters were short, it was difficult getting through them. Overall, not a terrible reading experience."
4,A Comprehensive guide,The Hasselblad System (Hove Pro-Guide) by Bob Shell is a comprehensive guide for amatures and professionals alike. Bob Shell does a great job taking you through the components of the Hasselblad. He gives you tips on how to get the most out of your camera. The chapter on films was particularly good; I especially enjoyed his discussion on infrared films.
1,Louzy book as it is,"IF you want more detailed Hasselblad equipment information. try to buy the book ""Hasselblad Compedium"" which is a lot better book you should read. If you want to understand how this system all about. Find another book ""Hasselblad Manual"" This one has less pictures but more variety information about how to use your hasselblad gears. Buy others!!"
5,A trip down memory lane for sisters,Flipping through the pages of this book took my family on a trip down memory lane. It is a great keepsake for sisters who are friends.
2,Not much brighter than the smaller one we bought.,"We bought this light bulb to replace our other, smaller, similar bulb, in order to see better for our screen printing dark room. It works, but turned out not to be much brighter, or the same, as the smaller one. I don't know how that is possible, but it is. Maybe they use a higher wattage bulb and then coat it with thicker red stuff. Now we use a 60 watt CFL bug light which is way better."
1,Couldn't even give it away.,"This product was purchased for work. I'm a server and do Wine Service at least ten times a night. Everytime I atempted to use this, it split the cork, the screw part is very thick. The handle is uncomfortable in my hand and it is the WORST wine key I have ever used. I tried giving it to someone after I got another from a Wine Rep and no one would even TAKE it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,NOT the Professional version they used to sell,"This is not the Pedrini Professional that you used to be able to buy. This one has a slightly thicker corkscrew so it breaks the corks. It has been almost disastrous, several times I have been lucky to not get cork into the wine. I still have the one labeled ""professional"" and use that one because it works EVERY TIME. I bought this to have a spare. But when it consistently broke the corks I compared the two, and this ""waiter's corkscrew"" has a slightly thicker screw, so they must have changed their manufacturer. Terrible! Do not buy!"
2,DisappointIng corkscrew,After using this corkscrew the first time it bent badly. This is a cheesy flimsy piece of junk. I'm very diissappointed. I should have heeded the negative reviews. Sometimes it's difficult to sort out reality on Amazon reviews because there are a lot of folks with axes to grind. Do not buy this corkscrew for everyday use.
2,It rusted,"I liked using it, it got good reviews, I did not open many wine bottles with it, but it would work well. Recently I looked and the ""metal"" had rusted, so I just threw it away. ( I have had it for about a year or two) the bottle opener function works very well"
2,HATE IT!!!,"I had a Pedrini for 4 years and loved it but it got taken away at the airport so I had to replace it:( I ordered the same one, or so I thought!!! The new model doesn't have a serrated blade and it hardly cuts through the foil on a wine bottle. Also, it is VERY hard to open up a beer bottle with this one for some reason. I am a bartender so I use it A LOT and everyday I get angry!!! Don't buy this if you are a professional server/bartender!!!!"
3,"perfect corkscrew, if you get the right one","i've had one of these for years and, sadly, it recently disappeared. the pedrini is simple, elegant and very easy to use, however, if you look at the product photos, they show two different ones: one with the serrated knife and one with a smooth knife. my old one had the serrated knife. the one that i just received has the smooth knife. it's still a good corkscrew but not quiiiiite the same. the serrated knife cuts the foil cap easier than the smooth one and frankly, the hinges are very stiff. maybe it will 'break in' with time."
3,OK,"It does the job, but it isn't great. You still need to muscle it out to get the cork to come out."
2,Love Daniel Bryan but....,"There's hardly any content on this DVD that would compel me to purchase it. On top of that they failed to include Bryan vs Miz vs Morrison US championship match? The Bryan vs Ziggler trilogy? Or even a look back at Bryan's feud with Michael Cole on NXT, or his shocking turn as part of The Nexus? I'll wait until WWE decides to actually make a real collection of Daniel Bryan... YES! YES! YES!"
3,Uhhh,No Bryan vs. Miz vs. Morrison from HIAC or Bryan vs. Ziggler from Bragging Rights?? These matches should be no-brainers.
1,What a piece of dreck!,I am a big fan of Lovin Spoonful and Clapton. I could always take or LEAVE Butterfield as he is not the real thing. But this awful cd is not worth the price of the plastic it's made of. Wow...what a waste.
2,If you are using a command-line compiler,"Then this book may be a 4 or 5 star intro. I have done little to no programming, and am trying to learn with Visual Studio.NET, which made the first couple of chapters a nightmare- until I sat down in a bookstore and read the first two chapters of the Dummies book on C#, which told me what I needed to know about how to use the Visual Studio environment.Just a qualifying remark for people who are planning on learning C# as their first language using Visual Studio- look into one of the other books. Already know how to use VS? Maybe this book is for you. :-)"
3,Its only So So,I am a start out Programmer but I figured it would be a good book to start from. I did it for a while and I got really bored the leasons took forever. Then I tried a C++ book called WeekEnd Crash course and it was great and kept me interested if you want to do C++ instead of C# try that book
5,must have,if you don't have it you better get it igot it here for 20.00 & that is cheap m.l. from piqua peeeeeeeace.ohio ...representen
4,Wonderful starters and shipment was unharmed....:D,These two beautiful Masja Bigleaf Hydrandea bushes are now in my side yard and have them covered for the winter....Very excited to see them in the Spring!!
2,Great product but shoddy workmanship,"I agree with most that has been said about this player: the sound was excellent, its features were easy to use, and truth be told I didn't mind not having a remote. But the unit arrived shoddily put together, in particular the disc tray, and within hours of setting it up the tray stuck. I don't know whether this is an isolated incident or not, but I can't recommend for that reason."
2,"Mediocre, but what do you expect for $100?","Sounds OK. No remote control. Designed to be used with JVC unit. From an audio viewpoint, it does fine.From a functional viewpoint, it will play 5 CD's, but with no remote, it's necessary to walk over to the unit and change the program, etc."
3,"OK, but definitely overrated.","I bought this CD because I wanted to see how these modified arrangements would be since you all said that this CD was God's gift. It isn't. I can't really sit through the whole thing but it definitely isn't a total waste. The worst track here is definitely Emotions. I just wasn't feeling it much.Make It Happen, I'll Be There and Can't Let Go are the best. But the rest is just OK. And I definitely can't say that any of these songs can stand up to the originals (besides I'll Be There, it IS an original debut) And this verison of Emotions wasn't too good. And like her first CD it's OK, but overrated.Listen to the samples first, buyers!"
2,THIS THING ISN'T VERY GOOD.,"THIS CD WAS SOOOO DISSAPOINTING, AND I GOT AS THE FIRST CD I EVER OWNED AT THE TIME. I MEAN, COME ON, HOW PATHETIC, ONLY 7 SONGS? THAT IS DEFINETLY A WASTE OF MONEY & NOT TO MENTION TIME!"
4,Agree with last review,I totally agree with last reviewthe regular cast was the bestI think kris williams ruins the whole thing!!!!
2,Not any more.,"This is the fifth in this Stan Kraychik series. It seems Grant Michaels has been going downhill. This issue is just boring. I won`t read the next one(""Dead as a Doornail""). Enough for me. Sorry Stan. You used to be so fun..."
2,It was ok,"Did not enjoy this book as much as I was expecting to, judging from the nice cover. ""Boston"", the main character as nicknamed by another character named Cozy Dinette, is just plain nosey and gets himself involved in a myriad of nonsensical situations - I even started to hate him - I wouldn't like to meet him. The storyline drags on, but the novel DID have a decent ending, which kept me from giving this book a lower rating. The author's writing style kept me from becoming too intrigued at any point, and I had no problem putting it down. It took me about a month to read it when I could have read it in about a week. Key West is a much nicer town I feel than this book pictures it to be as well."
2,tiny and a waste!,"This is ridiculously small, I love Haba toys and am not at all thrilled with the tiny size of the ice cream, the pear or the apple...bummed about only one in the package, as well as the lolli pops. incredible waste of money and shipping. I know my son will like em anyway, so I will keep them but not happy!"
4,Parker for Trombone,"The book is an awesome transcription of Charlie Parker and his amazing solo and style. It is very accurate. It's a great way to enhance your improvisation library. The only problem that I had, was that the music is written down an octave than sounded by Charlie Parker. Obviously the tenor sax plays in a higher range. It's not really a problem, but you have to play an octave higher along with the recordings to try and match the timbre of the instruments. I guess it saves you from reading ledger lines or tener clef. Anyway, great book for a great price."
4,lively bellydance music,"This is the perfect CD for an ADD hyperactive bellydancer...the music is Middle Eastern, rich, lively, and the rhythm changes so often that it never gets boring. I absolutely love it! Along with the fast moves, each track has a short section of slow moves nicely played with either a violin, ney, or oud. Otherwise, be prepared to be breathless at the end of the song. It is definately a feel-good CD - puts a smile on your face."
5,One of Epson's best,A beautiful rag cotton matte paper. The colors just look so natural. Others have reviewed this paper in smaller sizes and gave it 5*.
1,old lousy movie,"Stupid story line, poor photography and bad acting. Supposed to be erotica but really misses the mark badly. There is not ones redeeming quality to this film.I think I saw it for free but I realized early even for free it was not worth watching."
1,A Rip-Off,This is a review of the DVD. It is possible (but unlikely) that the on-line version is better. I am sure the movie was a great movie when it was made and still would be BUT they cut out all the things that make a Sylvia Kristel movie interesting. It should be rated PG.
2,Bait and Switch,"This seems like a well made light, though not much better than a similar light costing $4.99 that I also purchased through Amazon. The frustrating part of the purchase is that I decided to buy it for the strobe function, as the website description says ""a durable machined aluminum body with Hi and Low settings and emergency strobe function"".Alas, there is no strobe function, or at least none that I could detect after reading the instructions and fiddling with the light for minutes. Maybe I'm missing something, but usually I find the descriptions fairly accurate."
3,"Worked well, then broke","I love the weight of the machine, though the small screen was tough to see and I had to use my reading glasses for it. Also, I had some software compatibilty issues with Windows XP for Tablet PC. Still, it was quick and portable and OneNote worked well at recognizing my handwriting, though it couldn't do it in real time and I had to convert it paragraph by paragraph after a meeting. Then, after about 13 months the hard-drive crashed. I had it replaced and 3 months later the motherboard croaked, so I gave up. I would think about a tablet PC again, but I'd want to be sure the software issues with the operating system were fixed, and that the hard-drive could take being tilted while running (what else is a tablet for if not to hold in your hand while you write?)."
5,"Call it regression therapy, if that sounds easier!","Morris Netherton, MD, is a pioneer in the relatively new profession of medical practitioners who have learned the value of taking their patients/clients into the realm of the ""unconscious"" when the painful symptoms they have been suffering from - sometimes throughout their lives - refuse to abate as a result of more conventional therapies.Netherton's book is so clearly and simply written that it leaves no doubt in the reader's mind that he has been able to make the break-throughs he describes through varying levels of regression work. It is to be hoped that his valuable book will soon see the light of day once more by being newly re-edited by some enterprising publisher!"
4,Happy With My Purchase,This book was written back in 1978 so it was hard to find. I was thrilled to find a good condition used copy here on Amazon and am very happy with the service and book received.
3,diamonds in rough...,"Personally I think that all Sleater-kinney albums have their own style. There were a few songs that really grabbed my attention like Ladyman, Youth Decay and Milkshake and Honey. Some of the album seems less exciting but its all about your preference. Its almost a blend of Dig Me Out (their slightly punkish album) and the Hot Rock. If you think this album is great make sure you listen to the Hot Rock! (its the best!)"
3,I dunno...are we all listening to the same cd?,"I'm amazed at the other comments here. Others say that the songwriting here is less assured than on their earlier albums--on the contrary, there are far more hooks and sparse arranging touches to differentiate the songs from each other than usual. Others say the vocals are vague--I disagree. Sleater-Kinney do more singing and less shrieking on this release, while still retaining enough of a punk attitude to be fun. I'm encouraged by Sleater-Kinney's new direction, as exemplified by You're No Rock and Roll Fun and Milkshake and Honey--way more poppy and radio-friendly, but by no means a sellout. I'll be curious to hear what their next release sounds like."
5,My first Sleater-Kinney CD....,LOVE IT <3I picked this up from the library and instantly fell in love with this band.
4,Lots of Rock and Roll Fun,"They rock, they play fast, hard and well, they have tons of 'tude (in that and practically nothing else they are like Jason and the Scorchers), they are nobody's victim, they assert their independence, their uncertainties and their confidence in every cut, and they are great to dance to -- for whatever age. In other words, the music that Sleater-Kinney produces is everything that has been best about rock since Elvis took the stage on Ed Sullivan years ago and, rooted in sources both black and bluegrass, reinvented popular music. And if that's not enough to sell you on this CD, Sleater-Kinney and their record company price CDs at considerably below the ridiculous stratospheric numbers most companies and performers are demanding today. Buy it today and strike a blow for rock and consumers everywhere."
5,This CD really deserves five stars.,"I buy a lot of music, rarely do I think that a compact disc really deserves five stars, but when it has all one could possibly want, great lyrics, amazing cords and music and fun -rock- songs that one can sing along to then five stars is due. Both if you are new to S-K or are a long time fan this is a good cd to start from or complete your collection. People's favorite songs are usually ""All hands on the bad one"" and ""Ironclad"", give those a try first and see what you think."
4,Great Album By a Great Band,"A powerfully inventive and unique album, ""All Hands on the Bad One,"" is certainly one of the best Sleater-Kinney records made. Highlights include ""Was It a Lie?,"" ""All Hands on the Bad One,"" and of course, ""Iron Clad,"" among others."
4,Pretty Good Rock,"This is a pretty good rock album. With this one, I can see why the band has received the positive spin. Really a three and half, but I thought three was too low"
2,nothing new here,"Well, it may be premature, but after one listen there was very little to grab me. Amazing to say it, but their sound, so vibrant and refreshing over the last couple albums, is starting to sound a bit stale--while I admire the purity of their indie/punk aesthetic, they needed to take a stylistic step forward here, and didn't."
5,#1 Must Have,"Sleater-Kinney is my favorite band. I just bought their new album, ""All Hands On The Bad One"",a few days ago. I have listened to it everyday nonstop since then. Sleater-Kinney is the only talented band out there right now. If you like REAL music by bands who can write songs, play instruments, and look darn good while they're doing it, this album is for you. The voices of Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein mesh perfectly on this CD. The drumming of Janet Weiss complements the precocious and adorably bratty sounds of Tucker and Brownstein almost like a game of catch in the backyard. My favorites: ""All Hands On The Bad One"", ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"", ""The Professional"", and ""Milkshake n' Honey."" In my opinion, the album is worth buying just for the following line: ""I've always been a guy with a sweet tooth and that girl was just like a king-sized candy bar."""
5,Not Quite So Politicized...But Still Good!,"While I don't like it as much as previous CDs, it's definitely work your money and much, much better than 99.99% of everything else out there."
1,cacaphony,"if your ears could smell crap that's the sensation you'd get. I can't understand how anyone can judge this mouseketeer, garage band done by middle school kids whose parents bought them instruments 4 weeks ago for Christmas, as deserving a record label and a career."
1,These caterwauling apes need their Motrin,"Gimme girls who're demure for boys who are fearful of getting an earful! Or even better, just play that Eminem single again!"
5,Refreshing and powerful!,"The women of Sleater-Kinney never seem content to repeat their past accompishiments-- their new album takes them in a decidedly different direction than ""Dig Me Out"" and ""The Hot Rock"", and the results are truly phenomenal.Sleater-Kinney's new sounds result from two things: Corin Tucker's willingness to step out of herself and sing from different points of view (listen to ""Milkshake and Honey!"", and drummer Janet Weiss' vocalization on a number of tracks. Weiss is an amazing musician, and the addition of her voice to songs like the title song and ""You're No Rock'n'Roll Fun"" give the group new harmonic possibilities.The music itself is a lot of fun to listen to, yet it also gets to the heart of what music has become today, and what it can become in the future. I hope the women of Sleater-Kinney lead the pack into the unknown!"
3,Photo books,"Good condition as stated but I would not buy this again, I thought it was more of a instructional type. Just pictures of TEXAS."
5,Old favorite,"The Bernstein bears were my favorite books when I was a kid. My husband and I decided to tell our parents we were pregnant by buying our favorite childhood books and writing on the inside ""this was mommys favorite book. Will you read it to me when I get here in September?""."
4,nice fun visit,Wasn't what I was expecting but a O.K. book. I will enjoy reading it to my Granddaughter. She is almost 2 1/2 and has stayed with both Grandparents when her parents go away so she will understand the story line well. Do not love the price. I usually buy hardback books for her.
2,Undistinguished melodies pleasantly played.,"For all the five stars awarded by other listeners, I would expect unforgettable melodies. There are none. Despite the new age marketing, this is actually electronic pop that did not drive me away as much as never compelled me to listen again."
2,Music for yoga and snogging,"Mehdi makes nice instrumental music, but I don't find it as as compelling as most of the rest of the reviewers on here. (...) I found the music of Amethystium more visceral and compelling. I found Chimera by Delirium, while not strictly instrumental, more engaging. This is the music I hear when I go to my favorite sushi restaurant. It's good music; it's not necessarily music I need to hear anywhere other than my favorite sushi restaurant."
1,Strikingly familiar....where have I heard this before?,"Oh ya, it was inside that elevator at the embassy suites...Or wait, I think it was the background music in that 90's soft-core porn movie on Skinomax the other night.....Actually I got it now...it was playing over the ending credits of that movie my wife was watching on the Oxygen network.....No wait, it definitely was the music that that horrible magician used in his act at that small Reno casino...Now that I think about it, it was the music played by that German guy with a mullet during the fund raiser on PBS......No no no, it was the intro music on the instructional video that came with our electric dog clippers...Either way, I'm definitely NOT going to ever ever ever buy, or willingly listen to this, the musical equivalent of agent orange."
5,Unbelievably Beautiful,"I cannot tell you how incredibly inspiring this album really is. Words just wouldn't do it any justice. I had never before heard of Mehdi until I found him here at .... I hadn't really paid attention to his music until I read the reviews on his first album, Instrumental Dream. The reviews were all very positive so I was curious to hear the cd, so I bought it. I don't regret buying it for one second. The first track alone is amazing. Soon I went out and bought all six of his recordings. They are all wonderfully beautiful and also very different from one another, which is a good thing. I highly recommend you buy his first volume to start out with, because it will leave you wanting more."
5,Fell in Love with this immediately.,"I love this new sound, it's like a greatest hits compilation and all my friends are asking me where I got it. Mehdi is very talented and I will definitely buy all of his CDs. If you like instrumental music this one is special and you just can't go wrong."
2,Drums Distract in Instrumental Dream,"I couldn't help but hope that the drums would stop throughout the music so that I could hear the instrumentation. But alas the drums take the ""Dream"" from the ""Instrumental."" About the time the instruments seem to be winning, enter the drum machine. I was looking for something a bit more flowing."
5,Beautiful Music,"I've never even heard of Mehdi until I was at Downtown Disney in Anaheim last week. I saw 2 guys playing some very soothing music and they were also selling CDs. After hearing a couple of tunes, I decided to check out their CDs. They had 5 or 6 available, but the last song I heard them play, ""The Dream"", was just beautiful, especially with that middle eastern intro. That tune happen to be on their first album, so I bought it. Needless to say, the whole CD is just excellent. The only thing I didn't like was the album cover. I only wish it wasn't so dark."
5,Refreshing & Enchanting Melodies,"Well... From the very 1st time I saw Mehdi on PBS A while back, I instantly fell in love with the music.If you're looking for ""enigma-genre"" music like some others, then this will disappoint you mightily. However, if you're looking for refresh music, then there's no better, PERIOD. Start with East meets West with ""Eastern Sunset""... by the time you get to ""Flight of the Eagle"", you'll be so exhausted waiting for something bad. NO, you won't find it in this or the rest of his CDs. Very refreshing, very enchanting and best of all, very satisfying..."
2,Uninspiring.,"While I was in the process of ordering some CD's by Tim Janis and Phil Coulter, some images of this CD popped up on the screen. On the basis of all the favorable reviews, I ordered a copy. Unfortunately this recording leaves me unimpressed. I have heard it said that most of the music written by Puccini and Andrew Lloyd Weber is a variation on just one theme. More so with Mehdi. Each track seemed to be very much like the next: rhythmic noodling with lackluster melodies. Obviously there are a lot of people who like Mehdi's music. For me is it unispiring."
4,Soothing music but somewhat generic,"Mehdi's music flows well and is soothing, but I agree with some reviewers that it loops a lot and is somewhat generic. The melodies are not all that memorable, but it's still a good CD. I think Yanni has more sweeping and beautiful melodies, and the Narada artists are also a good choice for quality instrumental and electronic music."
5,Great ATG!,"I bought it thinking I will be happy if it lasts for 6 months. Now, its more than 10 months, and still going strong. I had used it everywhere from normal day wear to light running, and even for rafting once. It's difficult to lose it and mine was not made in China. Great to have one like this."
5,cool,"won't wear them until summer, i can tell they are very well built.AND WHAT A HECK OF A PRICE. ! WOW!"
5,Best Pens,"Of all the push button pens I have ever used, these are by far the very best. We look for them whenever we are out of pens.Black mediums are the name of the game!"
3,Not like I remember,"These have been the best pens I've ever used with the exception of this batch. Not sure if something has changed with production, but the ink seems to blob up at the tip of the pen from time to time whereas this had never been a problem before."
5,"Features an artist named Explicit, but doesn't have Explicit Lyrics!","This is a great Christian hip-hop album by Sev Statik. Lots of throwback beats, good hooks, and Statik's adept lyricism. And while one of the songs does feature a lady rapper who goes by the name Explicit, the album does NOT contain explicit lyrics of any kind. Hopefully, Amazon will reevaluate this and remove the ""Explicit"" tag so people won't miss out on this great album."
5,Scar Tissue,"William G. Tapply is one of the finest mystery writers working today. In ""Scar Tissue"", Brady Coyne receives a phone call from Jake Gold telling Brady that his son, Brian had been in a fatal auto accident. Brian's girlfriend, Jenny, has been killed, but Brian's body hasn't been found. Brady feels there is little he can do, but when he finds Ed Sprague, chief of police in Reddington, murdered in a motel room and when Jake Gold disappears, Brady begins to investigate. Brady uncovers a child pornography ring and blackmail, as well as murder. This is an excellent addition to a top-notch mystery series."
4,Great for beginning birders,"I read this book as part of my exercises to complete my activities for the book ""Forty Excuses to Get Together with the Girls,"" specifically ""Excuse #10: Because I Want to Know that Bird's Name."" (This is a chapter that has step-by-step instructions on how to start watching birds. The book has 39 other chapters devoted to other areas of interest.) I am a beginning birder and so much of the information was new and fascinating to me and it really helped put my local expeditions in a much larger perspective. I found myself picking it up every once in awhile for a birding ""fix."""
3,so-so,"This book is ok. It's not exactly the enrapturing saga that you may expect (yea right) but it is authored (sorta) by T.S., who also co-sorta-authors another, more interesting alloy book, '...any advice?' featuring the most interesting dillema's ever asked to alloy. I wouldn't buy it, (which i did, big mistake) but i would borrow it from a library. a one time use."
4,Government Getting You Down?,"Denizen Kane, a name that reminds me of the very old average man versus the crooks movie ""Citizen Kane"", is an open mic poet and emcee rapper that got his start with the Typical Cats. In this second volume of ""Tree City Legends"", Denizen Kane gives us ten more pieces of some new sounds and familiar beats. He sounds off in ""Patriot Act"", which is unyielding on government snoggery and pokery. Reflecting on his bootleg life, Denizen Kane comes through with emphatic seriousness in ""Junie's Song"". The remaining eight songs aren't quite as convincing - I mean Citizen Kane is sliding down the slippery slope to a Nazi Amerika along with the rest of us, but where's the passion? The Blair-n-Bush crime alliance has broken more laws and killed more people than Al Capone, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Bonnie and Clyde combined! At times holding back in emotion, overall this second volume doesn't quite make 5 stars."
4,An Ethereal Experience,"An eclectic mix of jazzy, soulful and gospel vibes, makes this CD a most enjoyable listening experience. To paraphrase another reviewer, the work of Mateo and Matos is on a similar par to the Naked Music genre. It is not as smoothly produced as the Naked Music or Jay Denes style, but that all adds to the appeal.Tracks like ""Unconditional Love"", ""Got to be free"" and ""Sunshine"", mark the essence of this compilation. These tracks (for me particularly) in addition to the other tracks are literally inspirational.If you're feeling really low or down, these tracks will uplift you. Raw, soulful, deep-house energy captured on disc. A truly stimulating experience."
3,was disappointed,"Maybe this is wonderful for dancing which is why I gave it an OK on the scale. I purchased this mistakenly thinking it was worship music to assist me into the throne room of God. It does not. It's typical music you hear when the dancing with flags are used. So, if this is what you want the music for, then maybe it will suit you well. I still listen to about four of the songs, if I'm already in the spirit, but the rest I pass by. Hope this helps someone."
5,Best buy on the best Nag Champa,"I've been buying Goloka for more years than I can remember. It is much less expensive than the more ""popular"" brands, but in my opinion it is also the highest quality I have found. There is a subtle depth in the scent that I do not get from any other Nag. I love it, I burn it often and I give it as gifts."
5,incense with a conscience,"received the item fast! Goloka Nag is pure bliss; the scent is easy and wonderful. with a 1 kg box, i'll be burning these outstanding nags for a while:)"
1,Gary Krist has stolen part of my life...,Where to start...this book was simply a waste of time. The characters were empty stereotypes. The plot was transparent. I wanted more detail. His presentation of Internet technology was awkward; he is clearly out of his depth. Ditto for his presentation of the pharmaceutical industry.
5,Gary Krist's Bad Chemistry,"Gary Krist's 'Bad Chemistry' has an outstanding message within this fine piece of literature. The message is that no matter how well someone knows someone knows someone else, they will undoubtedly be surprised. Joel Baker definitely surprises his wife Kate within this book. He surprises her by disappearing, and leaving his drugs from his drug ring behind. Kate is held aghast by this and is determind to find the man she married only three years prior. When Jin Liang Lu, another member of Joel's secret life is found brutally murdered, Kate's suspiscion increases dramatically. All in all, Joel's return was not for Kate, but for information off of their home computer. While this scenario is going on, Kate is getting closer to they boy who found Jin's body, Evan Potter. Everyone can relate to a character within this book, or a point of view, or the message. The message being that even the people closest to your heart will have a few surprises along with them."
5,A realistic heroine solves an unusual mystery,"Two aspects of this thriller set it apart from the average. First, the heroine is believably fallible. She makes stupid mistakes, trusts the wrong people, and lets her emotions control her thinking. How could I not care about the fate of such a familiar character? Second, the crime she uncovers is an interesting twist on the typical techno-biological plots. As an added bonus, Krist writes clear, effective prose that is a pleasure to read. Kathleen T. Choi, HAWAII CATHOLIC HERALD"
3,Not a complete dictionary - more of a phrasebook.,I guess I should have read the description more carefully. This is not a complete dictionary. Mostly it's a phrasebook. I guess if you're new to Russian this book might be somewhat helpful.
1,This is the worst text book,This was convoluted and boring. It was so hard to read through the two writers writing style. You spent more time trying to understand the writer than the concept. I would not recommend this for any class.
2,There's better out there..,"I got this book for a class I was taking. For a book about visual design, there were very few pictures/colors. It was also hard to follow."
5,I love it!!!,I absolutely love this...it is so much fun and you really feel the burn! I've used it a few times and really feel like i'm getting the hang of it
2,not a favorite,"The first dance is okay, the others didnt do much to get my heart rate up at all. I have only done this dvd once and Im just not happy with it. The dances are short and not at all heart pumping work outs, maybe for a beginner they would be ok. I am 48 years old and I did not feel like I got a work out even doing the entire dvd. I have several of The Firm dvd's that I like very much but I would not recommend this one."
1,Not so hot.,"I got this at the same time as Tracey Mallett's FuseDance Cardio Melt. I sent this one back. Not only did it not raise my heart rate, but only one of the three instructors even looks like a woman! The main instructor looks like Godzilla leading a waltz! I would not spend money on this! I am going to use the money I get back for another Tracey Mallett DVD."
1,Why are the refills more expensive than the pens?,"Zebra's F-301 Stainless Steel Retractable Ballpoint Pen 0.7mm Black Dozen (27110AMZ)for $20.18 (and free shipping with Amazon Prime).Zebra's F-402 Stainless Steel Retractable Ballpoint Pen 0.7mm Black Dozen (29210AMZ)for $38.92 (and free shipping with Amazon Prime).The refills, however, typically are priced around $6-$7 for product & shipping, for a 2-pack.That's $36 for one dozen refills, barely better than the cost of the F-402 pens, and nearly twice the cost of the F-301 pens.Now, the environmentalist in me wishes to reuse these pens, as their construction is solid, and they should last several refills. However, at these prices, it makes no sense!If I could get a dozen refills for $12 (including shipping), I'd buy them."
4,Its all good but the shipping!,"The product is good, hard to find at a bricks & mortar store. But, the shipping is not reasonable. It is obviously just extra profit. It is certainly not a reimbursement of costs. But, all the competitors do it too. What can we do?"
5,My favorite pen,"The Zebra Ultra F-301 is my favorite work pen. Everyone seems to steal them but for those few that I've managed to keep and have run out of ink, these refills have worked great and save me money in the long run."
5,Perfect refill,Refill fit my pen perfectly. Items were in perfect condition upon arrivel. Nothing negative about item to mention. Would recommend.
5,Good refil!,"They write smooth, don't run... and they are better than the cartridge you get with a new pen. highly recommended!"
2,The ink is dry!,"I bought a Zebra F-301 ball pen in Hong Kong and I loved to use it! But when I went back to the States, I used it up so I wanted to buy some refill. Compared to the original pen, the refill I bought could not write smoothly as the ink was dry. Disappointed with the purchase :("
4,Pleased with this frame,I purchased this frame as a birthday gift for my wife who is not computer friendly and has asked for ways to look at all the digital pictures we have without sitting down to a computer. This frame is great. It works well and is easy to set up. I had it going with both memory cards and a flash drive in no time. I resized photos to 480x320 as recommended by another post and that resolution works perfectly.No complaints and I may buy another one for parents as a Christmass gift. The size is right and the price is great.
3,Not suitable for bench competition.,"This works well enough if your goal is to sight in rifles and have some fun shooting off the bench, however there is slop in the windage adjustment which makes in unsuitable for bench competition. Even with modification I was unable to stop the slippage. The rear ""holder"" is coated with some type of rubber type material and allows the stock on my rifle to rock. All-in-all this is a get what you pay for product. I sold it."
5,A+++++++++++++++++++++,"I have well over 80 Railroad history books, and I would rate this one amoung my top five, the quality of the photos is beyond what you would expect for the time period, and I love reading the quotes from the old ""hogers"", fireman, and others about their experiences, I paid $30 for it and it was well worth the price."
5,My son loves this book!!,"This is my son's favorite book, since he was about 4 months old. The eyes first attracted him, and captivated his attention. He is eleven months old now, and enjoys reading it over and over. He especially likes opening and closing the flaps, turning the pages, and sticking his fingers through the holes! A definite winner! We are going to try the rest in the series for his birthday and Christmas."
4,10 page lift the flap book with moving eyes.,"My 13 month old daughter loves this lift the flap book. The flaps are big enough for little fingers to find easily. Every animal that is ""found"" has big moving eyes that she loves to poke and laugh at."
1,Ditto on the Caveat Emptor,"This short collection by the prolific, Joseph Campbell is disjointed, incomplete and misleading. That's probably due to the heavy handed editing mentioned a previous reviewer. The selections are skewed heavily toward traditional western religion, particularly, Christianity.Most of Campbell's followers understand that his religious inclinations were more in line with Eastern religion and philosophy. Campbell did not believe in a personal God and made that fact well known throughout his life. Yet the editor appears to go out of his way to imply that Campbell had some sort of bedside conversion or Christian revelation just before he died. Ridiculous! It difficult to imagine just how this editor was able to arrange this work. There are many great books written by Joseph Campbell, but this is not one of them."
2,A Rip-off of Hot To Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. With The Soul,"The title of this book bears a strong resemblance to the recently published book, How To Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. With The Soul. The title of the book and the approach of the editor use the unique language of the above book to delve into religion and spirituality and myth making. I would suggest that readers review the above book and compare the similarities.J. HansenNew York, New York"
4,An Encyclopedic Knowledge of Mythology,"Joseph Campbell is a brilliant thinker with an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology. THOU ART THAT, however, is filled with dense material and is not an easy read without some prior familiarity with Campbell's work - such as his TV interviews with Bill Moyers.I am also beginning to read books by some of the Jesus Seminar scholars and I find that Campbell's writings are somewhat similar while his interests are much broader in scope."
5,Excellent kit,"This kit is just like the one I trained on and used over 30 years ago. Simple, and it has everything you need to deliver a birth (human) provided there are no complications. I keep a few in my emergency medical supplies as a precaution, and a open one for training others. For the price, it's a great value."
3,3.5 Stars,"A good CD. I love ""Soul With a Capital 'S'."" It's awesome. This CD is good, but some of the songs aren't. ""Educated Bump"" is cool. Lenny Pickett is great. I recommend ""TOP."""
4,I Came To My Decision And Bought This CD!!!!,"This is the only CD that I own by T.O.P. It's a mixed blend of funk, soul, jazz, and rock. Although some of the music seems to be dated...The playing and the singing are top-notch! The best songs are Quiet Scream, Cruise Control, Please Come Back To Stay, You, and Come To A Decision. I came to my decision and bought this CD several years ago...Now, go and do the same and you won't be sorry!!!"
1,CD is useless if you are using 64bit,"System requirements does not specify that the software can only be used on 32 bit. This is the second time I have purchased materials from REA specifically because of the CD for study on computer but was unable to use it because I have 64 bit. When contacting the company via e-mail about the GRE study materials, I was told that 64 bit version was not available. I am still waiting for a reply for ESL beginner. I feel that it is the company's obligation to notify customers of this problem prior to purchase and offer a solution (either refund or offer 64 bit)"
4,Good for ESL Students,My adult student from the Philippines said this was just the kind of book that he needed.
2,Excels at Mediocrity,"This is neither a satisfactory product nor a helpful organization. The company is a study in mediocrity. Their website, although newly redone, ultimately isn't helpful at describing products or distingushing between products, their salespeople hardly know their product, their technical support are unhelpful novices. The better news is that the product somewhat works. On clean print, the product did scan well. Practice helps but you still need to concentrate on a perfect swipe. I was suprised that it scanned very small print and even worked with fast swipes. Ultimately between the futzing around with trying to get a perfect swipe, incomplete dictionaries, frequent pen reboots, I decided to return the product. In its present state, this pen is only good for a narrow group of uses. I am hopeful that a future generation of product will scan with less effort and have a complete dictionary. Bluetooth instead of IR would be very desireable. Hopefully they will get staff 2.0 too."
2,D.L. Moody,"I didn't finish this book. I am not real familiar with D.L. Moody, though I know he is well respected in the Christian community. I did hear that he was one of the people who discovered and taught ""Christ in you the hope of glory"". The problem I had with this book is that it seemed to contradict that understanding and the title. Seemed like the usual legalistic self-effort to clean up ones flesh. I could be wrong though and I will not judge Moody based upon this one book."
5,Absolutely Worth It!,"This book is a marvelous compendium on the numerous variety of native Californian oaks. The authors amaze you with information about the oaks, and pictures that are stunning. The charts of flora and fauna species associated with oaks in the back are worth the price.--which by the way is ... cheaper than on other websites!This book makes a fabulous gift for any Californian in the oak region, living abroad and homesick, or any Californian traveling abroad and wishing to take with them a gift that uniquely expresses what is a quintessential icon of their native state."
3,this book is no gem,"i found this novel a little too short, and a little unreal. the mystical aspect of the novel was ok, but because it didn't have a real depth, and seemed to have been written in a rush (sorry, just felt like a long short story to me), it was hard for me to love the characters.ruby was a darling, but really uneven. however, poor orlando bloom.. oops i mean orion woolf.. eh hem.. was so invisible i couldn't care for him at all.. tho i was glad she made his back better.i love the genre, i love the lovely cover, i even nearly loved ruby... but this book was pretty weak.. i wanted to like it much more than i did.(aaannndddd.. you really didn't disguise orlando very well, ladies... lol)"
3,"Beautifully written, if a bit disturbing.","Really poetic, but a not quite as much as Block's writing usually is. It's a bit more straightfoward. The only issue I had with it was the subject matter being a bit explicit/disturbing for me. It's still a compelling book, though, and I enjoyed it."
1,couldn't even finish it.,"i bought this book because ms block is one of my favorite authors, but i was really disappointed with it. the style is very different from block's usual stuff, and the plot starts out just a little cliche... there's a girl who's father hits her and she's leaving but the memories stay with her and tear her up inside. then she sees this guy in a movie and just ""knows"" that she's destined to fall in love with him...blech. much as i love ms block's work, and i mean really love...i have to say skip it. this book has somehow become a teen issue novel instead of a block novel."
2,Just OK,I am a long time Block fan and found that this book just lacked the imagination and poetic language as her other books. I was so disappointed I didn't even finish it.
1,Magical,"I read this book wondering how having a co-author would influence the writing and story. Once again FLB visits the fantastic and the real with the evocative writing that she is well-known for. This was a powerful book that I read today on the ferry. I couldn't put it down---but did to cringe in reaction to some of the passages of abuse that just shook me. Early in the book there are quick references, but later especially the last seciton of the book it becomec clear that the protagonist's father was an evil, abusive man.I look forward to other collaborative books between these two authors.This book won't dissapoint."
4,Great themes for kids,"I've shown this movie to groups of 6th graders-- they love it. Themes include family stress, gender, honesty, friendship, and more."
1,"I Wouldnt, Either!","I'd let it burn to the ground, I wouldnt even spit on it. What exactly is this album? I bought it for Everclear, hoping some other bands sounded like them on it, but nope. It's just some lame album loosely thrown together with some bad bands, and even worse bands.I couldnt sell this album to anyone, heck, I couldnt even GIVE IT AWAY to some Used CD Stores.Dont Buy It."
1,junk!,had a set of 12 I've used for 2 years....loved them. the ones I rec'd were leaking ink all over the place and only 3 were usable.Too bad
2,Disappointing,I ordered four dozen and had to return 24 that were defective (retractors didn't work). Now I'm finding the ones I've kept have very poor ink flow performance.
5,Smooth,"This is my father's favorite ball point pen.We order it for the business all the time, about 15 dozen a year.He says it's always smooth writing and the retracable mechinism doesn't break down as easily as some other brands.Tried and true because I've ordered some other more expensive pens and at least one in each box would have some problem.But with the paper mate flexgrip ultra, every pen works great.The only reason why we have to order so much is not beacause they breakdown, it's simply because it's so nice that the employees take them home all the time. But that's another issue we have to deal with."
1,Leaky pens,Don't order these pens unless you are okay with gobs of ink on your paper. Each time I use one of these pens there is a blob of ink at the tip that gets smeared all over the paper. This is unfortunate: I expected higher quality from PaperMate pens.
4,Idiots & Computers,"Clearly the only reviewer of this product doesn't understand what they purchased. If you have a PS2 keyboard and want to plug it into a USB slot, you need a MALE PS2 to FEMALE USB adapter, not this product."
1,hhhmmmmm,"If you upgrade your computer on a regular basis, beware.You have to send for a new ""key"" every time you install (it is not included with the software). The last two times I upgraded my computer (or moved software to a different machine), I had to wait over a week to get it. The last one didn't work, so I gave up. I got ZERO customer service when I tried to get the last key corrected. I am NOT a computer novice...this was not a question of someone who doesn't know how to use a computer.Now I see they charge you to get a user guide?It was $120 wasted, as I barely go to use it."
3,A Disappointing End,"Pioneer has outdone itself in the audio arena, as this unit flawlessly plays CD and CD-R discs (even with blemishes) better than any CD or laserdisc player I've owned. Frankly, the 3-disk tray has only been used for music since I made the purchase 10 months ago. Unfortunately, the DVD player's abilities do not rate as highly with regard to video. First is the loud, obnoxious POP! and black screen that occurs during layer switching on the DVD. Second, rented DVD's have never played ""clean"" from start to finish, often being interrupted with what looks like old-fashioned vertical hold problems. At first I thought this was typical, but friends do not have the same problems. Even on newly purchased DVD's the player can produce a loud POP! and skip a few frames when a new chapter switches in. Outstanding features, but a disappointing end to a promising, diverse player."
4,I wish it weren't so thin.,"We buy a lot of paper each year. Mead provides a good basic (cheap) paper that will no doubt meet the needs of most students. However, I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day. It's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option but for wide-ruled paper (for younger students) I think it really shouldn't be quite so thin.Pricing Note (not part of the review):The price as I write this review is $1.33 for 200 sheets of wide-ruled filler paper. That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping. If the price is higher as you read this review you may want to consider coming back at the start of the next school season and stocking when they are on sale."
2,What a rip-off,"I am a home school mom of 2 boys. I don't have a car so I try to shop online. I thought this was a good deal-wrong! After about 20 pages the problems started. The lines on the paper were all messed up or not there at all, some pages were in halves and stuck together and to top it all off when I made my monthly trip to Walmart I found much more paper(almost double) for MUCH less. How sad."
5,Love the convenience,This is a standard product at a good price. It is great to be able to get refills to your doorstep. The wide ruled paper helps my son write more easily and neatly due to the greater gap between his lines.
2,"Decent Product, Terrible Price","Obviously I chose to buy this product at this price- orginally 6.47 Prime price 4.47. It was out of convenience/necessity but never again. The school supplies on Amazon, unlike many of Amazon's other amazing deals are a rip-off."
2,Not Up To My Standards,"I'm not very picky with paper, as long as it's nice quality but Mead is no exception. Although Mead sells quality products, their looseleaf papers have always been a problem for me. The problem is that they have such a bad, cheap smell and the quality of the paper is very close to what I will find at a 99 cents store, minus the sandy texture. I've been buying Staples paper for as long as I can remember and I find that their quality is so much nicer (and cheaper!). I don't think I'll even spend more than $1 on Mead looseleaf, let alone $4."
2,my fault,I was disappointed in the music/worship. I cannot put my finger on what or why. It just did not click with me. But may be my taste.
4,Entertaining historical fantasy with multiple story lines,"I purchased this book based on the positive reviews, and it was a pleasant read. There is a lot happening in this book- the spunky artist heroine and her struggle to survive annd her romance with our intrepid hero. In addition there is Da Vinci code like story line with a Prior of Sion group who are out to get her and restore the Merovingian kings to the throne of France. Besides this there is a villain who brings forth a demon and the angel Hadriel who battles the demon and helps our heroine. Plus there is the story of Mary Tudor and her marriage to the King of France and the successsion battle after he dies! Personally I think the author could have cut out one or two of these story arcs to make for a tighter read. Nonethless it was pleasant and I really like our heroine Suzanne and the Hero Robert Ashton. I will try some more of this authors books."
4,"Fun, quirky read","I actually own the hard copy of this book and have read it 3 times in the last 5 or 6 years, I enjoy it that much. I highly recommend it to anyone who has a penchant for historical fiction.While not a work that is not exactly based upon any particular person or events in history, the author is still able to transport you to the court of Henry the VIII while adding a touch of humor as well as some interesting facts about miniature painting.After reading this and loving it so much, I also read others by this author and was not disappointed."
2,Silly and Really not all that interesting,"The attempt by the author to incorporate ethereal beings such as angels and demons into Tudor England fails miserably. It just ends up being silly and ridiculous. It's like the Thomas Kincaid of the literary world-- this really artificial and sticky sweet vision that is supposed to make you feel all warm and cozy--but it really just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Someone pass the tic tacs, please."
4,Highly entertaining,"I absolutely love Judith Merkle Riley's accurate incorporation of the living conditions faced by women during the periods she writes about, and her creative, fun ideas about how they deceive others to survive and thrive in such a harsh culture. The angels made me laugh throughout."
4,Very good book!,"I've been a fan of Judith Merkle Riley's books for a couple of years, and this book is really great. Susanna is a strong female character, and it is easy to get involved in her story; also, to see a woman in such an unusual position, where she is supporting herself, in the early sixteenth century was refreshing. However, The Serpent Garden doesn't quite measure up with another of Riley's books, The Oracle Glass, which I count among my favorite books. Susanna, though adventurous, is also sometimes overly modest and goes on and on about women's traditional roles, being a good wife, etc. However, if you like historical fiction, and if you enjoy Riley's books, I really recommend this one. Despite its shortcomings, it really is an enjoyable read and I'm happy to have it in my library."
4,Typical of a Jinks McGrath book: visually wonderful,"Like other books by Jinks McGrath, et al, this book is visually appealing with great photos and clear instructions on a number of projects involving metal working skills. While not the end-all, be-all, it is informational enough to help one become practiced easily with simply written explanations and clear visuals. This is a nicely formatted book, worthwhile for introductory and beyond skill building."
5,This is the BEST,"I've got every Terri Hendix CD, and with each one I think - Wow! This is the best ever! Playful, introspective, thoughtful, funny - with music and lyrics complimenting each other to a 'T'. This is one of my favoite CD's of all time - Can't wait for the next one!"
2,Fabric ripped!,"We bought this for my son who loves the Wiggles & loves this chair, but the fabric on the seat ripped after we had it for a week or 2. I've called the company & I think they're going to remedy it, but still seems unsafe."
3,good product,im 181cm tall and 32 or 33 by waist i took a medium size it fitted me well i use it for concealed carry although it shows under my arm because there is a bit of a gap so it shows the holster if i raise my arms but i still like this product ..
1,What has become of us?,"We used to camp out days in advance when the new model year's ballpoints came out. Now people can simply have them shipped directly to their house right after release. Kids today will never know the excitement of flipping over a Bic truck and fighting over the contents, and we'll never have another unifying event like the EraserMate Panic of 1981. People have lost all sense of perspective in this country."
1,Stopped working . . . what a rip off,"These are almost 3 dollars for a dozen of them. After writing with one every day for several months, I found that it stopped working. Theres a built in 'power indicator' kinda thing that reminds me of a thermometer. Well the black colored 'temperature reading' of this thing has been steadily going down for months, is now at 'zero', and this pen won't work at all. What's up with that?! For almost 25 cents per pen, you think they could at least make a quality product that wouldn't stop working."
2,As Advertised...,"You would think that now, in 2012, our writing implements would be more advanced. As a consumer who has much experience with the older models of pens, I was expecting much more technological features in this pen by a trusted brand - Bic.Needless to say, when I received my pens I was ecstatic to try out this new version.I was very disappointed when I discovered that it is only any good at writing. Not only did it not have a voice-activated hands free function, but it wouldn't write in different colors, in different thicknesses, and I couldn't even calibrate it to efficiently write in cursive! Buyer beware - this thing is useless for signatures unless you have been properly educated the old fashioned way to sign your name.You get what you pay for."
1,Warning!!! Not Mac Compatible!!,"I recently bought these pens only to find they are not made for macs. In addition to only working with PC's, I found that also lacked a USB 2.0 port, installation software, and were extremely susceptible to spyware. These pens are not y2k compatible and contain no slot for extra memory. All in all I was not impressed with this product."
3,Writes in English NOT Spanish.,"I am taking a Spanish class and saw this pen in a store with packaging both in English and Spanish. Since I had to write a short essay in Spanish and I only speak English, I thought that this pen was perfect. But I tried to save some money by buying these on line. Notice that this packaging is only in English. I started writing my essay but it only came out in English (which will work for most people). But I needed the bilingual pen. 'Very disappointed."
2,"It's Bic Pens, not a BIG PENIS !!!","Coming home a bit drunk after a bachelorette party a friend and I decided to go online to order some sex toys for use to use with our boyfriends. I don't know if it was all that tequila we drank but we both went a bit crazy ordering various items. The next day we awoke to find ourselves in bed, together, naked, with my thong spinning around the room atop the ceiling fan. We were both pretty embarrassed. We've not spoken in the weeks since then, but did manage to be cordial at the weeding in which we were both standing up in. The day after the wedding I received one of my Amazon boxes (you don't even want to know how many I received since that one night) and was shocked to find a box of Bic Pens. I realized now, I thought I was ordering a Big Penis. These was was too narrow for my intended use (I tried). They seem to write fairly well, though. Repeat, it's not a big penis."
1,Doesn't work on birds.,"These pens are fine for writing on paper, which is great if your life is so friggin' boring that you write on paper. I bought these so that I could draw on some small birds that I caught out in the woods behind my house. One was a cardinal. I think the other one was a sparrow but I can't be sure. When I tried to draw on them, the birds kept making a huge racket and getting all upset. They hated these pens. One got loose and flew all over the room, all freaking out and making noise. It scared my mom and knocked over a lamp and broke it. And all because of these stupid pens! Also the ink just doesn't work on feathers. You'd think that someone at BIC would have the common decency to put some sort of label on the packaging warning people of this defect. Horrible product. My mom says I should make them pay for the lamp, but they probably couldn't even write me a check because their pens are such a joke."
1,Health hazard,"Users of this item should exercise extreme caution. The product arrives with neither instructions nor warnings about appropriate use. While excellent for the purpose of writing on paper, this product is useless for extracting eye motes, cleaning the ears of pets, and other tasks which its shape suggests. The absence of instructions left me wondering about proper use until my son (cleaver lad that he is) stopped playing video games long enough to demonstrate its use. And, he is only 37 years old. Isn't he a cleaver boy!"
1,BUYER BEWARE -- cristal not as advertised,"BIC, YOU FLIPPIN SUCK! My brother Kip and I nearly died the other day due to your shoddy product. We made a valiant attempt to revisit the year of 1982 in order to learn some sweet dance moves. When we put in the pen and Kip turned on the machine, it freakin' killed. What a piece of crap. Kip noticed that your product seemed to be of inferior crystal. Are you guys freakin' nuts? My Uncle Rico is going to kill me if he can't use the machine to go back in time and take State like he planned. That machine better not be broken or I'm gonna have to show your my bow staff skills. This is pretty much the worst pen ever made. You guys are retarded. Plus, it made my liger look like total crap. Gosh."
4,Great for the price,I have really enjoyed this lens. It allows me a much larger field of view with good quality. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a good quality lens for the price.
4,A SWEET PIECE OF MUSIC!!!,"this is a collection of ""gifted"" songs handed over to O G Ron C to ""slow and throw"". this is an r&b; collection screwed, first off. i really wanted to give this r&b; mix 5 stars but i dont like all the songs on this cd although none of them are bad. not one! its just that they are not all my style.also on an important note, these songs are not blended together, which i personally prefer. although, OG ron C does advertise his F-Action/Wrecking yard label on almost every track, but its not too bad.here are my personal favorite off this album:1) Intro -by Andre 30002) Proto-type -by Andre 30003) Walked out of heaven -by Jagged Edge4) Come over5) U dont know my name -by Alicia Keys(and silly insert by OG ron)6) Read your mind -by Avant9) Me, Myself, and I -by Beyonce10)More and more -by Joe13)Coming where i'm from14)Purple rain15)Clubbin' remixthis really is a great collection. even if you're expiermenting with something new, you wont be disappointed."
5,Destined for Greatness,"If you want to feel really good, this is a definite go-to CD. High energy music that makes my day. Look forward to the next release. Can't wait to hear Sojorn live!"
1,What happened to Jennifer?,"The first time I heard Jennifer's voice singing her country songs, I stopped and said ""who is that?!"" Because it was so so good. She has such a moving depth to her voice. I hear none of that on this current album or her next one. Apparently Jennifer is not looking for success, but just wanting to try new things in a funky way. What a shame! She could have such a huge Bank account if she went back to the producers of her first album. Jennifer, are you listening? My ears yearn to hear more of that beautiful sound you showcased in your first album."
4,Zoom G2,"Great effects pedal, and tuner. Setup your sounds, carry the box everywhere, and just plug in. Great for practicing with the headphone jack.The only negative is the foot switches could have been bigger (like the 5150) or closer together."
5,Zoom G2 Pedal,"I got this for my hubby and he loves it. He finds cool new stuff to do on it every time he plays with it, only thing is, it says that it takes a certain type of AA battery to be cordless and still haven't found where to get them, so far no one we have talked to knows what we are talking about when we tell them the name of the battery and regular AA's dont work LOL. Over all Very pleased with it!"
5,Great pedal for the money!,"Easy to use, tons of features. Does require lots of tweaking to get the sound you want but then you can store it. Presets are ok but you will do better to create your own.I like the zoom stuff but some of it can be quirky and difficult to use. However, this particular pedal is not too bad as far as usability and is made well with metal and rubber. I expect it will hold up to heavy use. It's cool looking too. [...]"
2,More biography than explanation,"A bunch of mini biographies of statisticians, along with sort-of descriptions of why what they did was important. I say sort-of because there was often not enough for me to really understand why what they did was important. I will certainly accept that the difference between parametric and nonparametric statistics is vital and has real-world implications, but this isn't the book to explain why, and maybe such a book would have to be a textbook. To me, the book hung awkwardly between ""popular"" and ""science,"" and I would have liked more on the latter."
2,Stories of the statisticians,"I am statistically semi-literate. I work with numbers all the time, but not with very much statistical sophistication. This book did nothing to enhance my understanding or use of statistics. It's a bunch of stories about statisticians that Salsburg has known or heard about. Yes, it's interesting to hear more about folks whose names I have seen before. But I learned nothing about statistics in the process.This is an example of popular science writing that has no science in it, it's been dumbed down so much. I am sure that this is the book that Salsburg set out to write, but it seems like a crying shame.If you already know statistics, this may be some interesting professional gossip. If you don't, why bother?"
5,Recommended for leisure browsing as well as study,"Lady Tasting Tea is an unusual guide which explains how the statistical revolution in science came about, examining how statistical modeling examples were developed and used. Unique to Lady Tasting Tea is an exploration which includes no math formulas and assumes no prior grounding in math concepts, statistics or math history; making it quite accessible to lay readers, and recommended for leisure browsing as well as study."
4,"Overall, a good book.","I liked this book. It is well written, covers a lot of ground, and is a fast read for those who don't have much time. Being a scientist, though not a mathematician, I would have appreciated having the concepts explained in a little more depth, and wished there was an appendix, or a companion book, that went into the math."
2,More like a used one,It should be a new one according the website.But it has a lost scratched at the under and two block spots which cross about 15-20 pages
5,Great product Leica,"This is the second time on two different cameras that I decided Leica strap was the correct choice. Leica has a strong reputation of making a strong and great strap. It was the correct choice for me. It's on my latest Nikon camera, D7000.Thanks Leica."
1,"Racist, sexist, homophobic. Should not be sold.","Explain to a young black student why it is okay for books to be sold which promote racism and stereotypes by making fun of him/her. Explain to parents of students with disabilities why is is acceptable to market and sell materials which supports and promotes discrimination of their son/daughter. Explain to young women why is is appropriate for materials to be sold that make light of rape, incest, sexual assault and abuse. Explain to ethnic and religious minorities why our country tolerates materials which make light of oppression and violence against them. Freedom of speech? Freedom of the press? Yes. Responsibility to boycott these materials? Yes. Responsibility of corporations like Amazon.com and Borders to refuse to see materials that promote hatred, stereotypes, discrimination and abuse? I wish."
1,Shining example of human de-evolutionary bliss,"The fact that some people find this waste of paper (calling it a book is a GREAT injustice) even remotely amusing is quite interesting. First off, I will say that I am not a prude by any respects. But Blanche Knott has found a way to compile everything that's screwed up about human arrogance and ignorance into a compendium bursting with banality. Racism, homophobia, bigotry, misogyny; all things that people were oppressed, persecuted--even killed--over and someone (namely Blanche Knott) had the audacity to profit from this. Nice. Don't forget the Jewish jokes, Dead Baby jokes, even the disabled. I guess that de-evolution is ON THE RISE, and apparently profitable, too. I suppose we should all just destroy each other, then make it into a great joke book. Imagine: ""The Apocalyptic Jokebook, or, Natural Progression Gone Humorously Asunder."" Imagine the laughs. Save your money for a book that doesn't advocate stupidity."
3,Psychology,"I have to admit that this book is a pretty interesting case study. Unfortunately I'm not sure how much science and forward research was actually done. The experiment was done in the late 1950's - early 1960's. I wonder how much of it would be considered ethical and acceptable today. Interesting read, though it's important to remember that this is not a novel or even a non-fiction book as one normally conceives it. It's a case study. It makes the point/style of the writing, resolution, and 'character interaction' much different.21 Apr: After reading three young adult novels in a row at first I found this a bit difficult to start up. Now that I'm 25% through it and back in 'grown-up' reading mode, I'm finding it very enjoyable."
1,disappointed,"the pens looked attractive online, but in real they was not attractive at all and the ink is not flowing though the pens properly making them annoying to use."
1,Poor build quality - defective unit.,"I really needed a second DVD player and after much searching I settled on this Pioneer unit. But like so many other Pioneer DV-626D players reviewed..., this one also failed to display any video. I eventually went with the Toshiba SD-2200...and have had zero problems to date. I gave up a few features from the Pioneer, gained a few others on the Toshiba, and saved...(money) to boot. It's doubtful Pioneer equipment will ever make it beyond my front door again."
1,Need's Driver for Win2k/XP?,This item ships without any software. You can't just plug any ps2 keyboard with this adapter into a usb port and expect it to work. I will be returning this item soon.
5,"Outstanding book, outstanding professor","I took Dr. Jones in 1997, for the Indians of the High Plains class, at UCF, Orlando. He is, without a doubt, one of the most articulate, fascinating, and knowledgable people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. Sanapia is based on the time he spent with a Comanche woman of the same name, and it is a fascinating glimpse into the customs of the Comanche tribe. He spends a great deal of time discussing the spiritual concepts of the Comanches, as well as the use of various plants for ritualistic purposes. I recommend this book to anybody not only to anthropology students, but also to anybody with even a slight interest in Native American beliefs/culture."
5,comanche medicine woman,"Since I am Comanche, I really enjoyed reading about this woman. It was a shame that her children did not wish to follow in her path, and of how much knowledge was lost forever with no one to take her place."
4,Very very funny!!,"This is a very funny video. One thing, I love the behind the scenes on all of the stupid and funny things they did (""Nice dress, Chris!"" lol.). And also the bloopers are really funny. But one thing, why don't they have anything for Allison, and/or Ttark?? That's why my review is only 4 stars, not 5. I love this video, nonetheless."
1,Garbage,"It did very little to boost. Also, the indoor antenna is extremely directional, beaming in a very narrow cone. had to stand in one spot and within 6 feet to get my phone to work with it."
2,Not so hot...,"I held out high hopes for this device after reading some of the reviews. I get a very weak signal in my apartment and often drop calls. I have to go out on the balcony to get decent reception. After deciphering the unintelligible directions (come on folks, add a few pictures!!), I found that it did little to boost the signal I received in the apartment. Certainly not worth $500 to get a slight improvement and still drop calls. I'm trying to send it back to Computer Brain, but their return policy is not easy and they charge a re-stocking fee."
4,Caution with Installation,"Great product and we have tested others for less amplification power. In some cases installastion is tricky and although we might have 5 bars on cellular phones outside and installed antenna at that location, situation in the place is not the same and it might be necessary to install a better antenna on the outside or the inside.Any way, first and notably most important thing is that wherever you install the outside antenna, you must cross check that you can make a cell phone call and that signal is good. This system as it comes does not make miracles. If you detect that outside signal is weak, then proceed to change outside antenna and install a directional one which might correct situation.If inside you get a good signal but it covers a reduced place, you can try installing a better inside type of antenna and situation might get better."
4,The Avenger,This game is very fun when u play it on multiplayer but like most games back then u have to take turns. The objective is to shoot all enemy crafts and bomb any moving things on the ground. It is allot eaiser to play this game with the nes advantage because of the joystick. The only bad thing about this game is the shooting sound gets very annoying and it is very hard to beat. I only got to the thrid level. Other than that it is a great multiplayer game.
3,Mixed!,"The graphics in this movie are well worth watching. Fabulous! But the story and acting are atrocious. I've never seen such bad acting in any other movie in my life. Even if you ignore the soundtrack and just watch the acting it's BAD. It's like they took a group of really BAD actors, gave them a script written by adolescent children, full of dirty words and nothing else. BUT, if you can overlook all that long enough, the tidal wave scenes are well worth seeing.I will say that I don't speak the language the movie was obviously filmed in but it's like it was translated by someone who doesn't speak English and has a warped idea of what teenage Americans might sound like."
3,Tidal Wave or Haeundae,"Most of us are familiar with the plot lines of disaster movies, most of these movies are divided in to neat segments. The first segment consists of the buildup for the impending disaster, the disaster itself and the last part is the aftermath. This time is no different, however the settings have changed and the action has shifted to Korea. However although Ron Emmerich will remains the king of CGI laden disaster flicks, this movie is still bearable even though it features some annoying characters. 12/14/10"
2,the requisite characters...,This disaster flick with lotsa CGI has little to distinguish it except for its South Korean origins. The requisite characters die or survive.
4,Gone with the Wind of the Midwest,"This was a wonderful reading experience. The author made the likable characters so likable. Knowing that the author Barbara Vroman lives in the rural Wisconsin area, made reading the book more personal. As a point of interest not mentioned in the book, the fire from the Peshtigo area actually spread over the bay to the Door Penninsula and killed 77 persons as marked at a wayside approximately 7 miles South of Sturgeon Bay. I look forward to reading her new book ""The Experiment"""
1,"Film expired 3 years before delivery, batteries dead","Must have been in stock for too long, never expected that from Amazon.com!"
3,"Good camera, Good fun","This is a good little camera for fun, however its not really suited for serious photography. if you are looking for an economically good deal, a camera that will take pictures of friends and family, and record ""kodak moments"" this is it."
5,The Crem de la Crem of the Matter,"This book is inspiring, insightful and riviting. it describes the changes that have taken place in the Churches of Christ over that last 50 years (1950 - 2001) and does a great job in portraying its true values. This book is a real page-turner and should be read by all in the COC and some outside this fellowship as well. Perhaps it may shed some light on some misconceptions within this movement. Read it, love it and apply it."
5,BEST EDC EVER!,bought this as a 3 yr anniversery presemt for my boyfriend and he loved it! he has plenty of generic forgein knives that arent sharp but this was amazing. so sharp and he uses it everyday for everything. hooks into his pocket for easy use. its lightweight handle make it easy to bring everywhere and it came in a box with the benchmade gaurentee!
5,"Great knife, one of the best","Comparing with expensive, basement made Emerson A100, this a Benchmade knife is just a dream. It is ambidextrous, easy and smooth to open, no need to fix it like a A100 knife with a Dremmel tool"
5,Awesome knife!,"Benchmade sets the benchmark for utility knives (lewl).Awesome quality, super sharp, precise and easy to use locking/unlocking mechanism. Very smooth action. Steel quality is fantastic. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a high quality, basic pocket or utility knife that will last forever. This knife is deceptively big though...if you've got small pockets or hands, you may want to check out the mini version. In pink. c:"
5,Awesome Knife,I received my knife within a few days of ordering and I must say I am totally impressed. This is my first Benchmade but definitely will not be the last. I priced this knife on other sites and ended up paying a lot less on amazon. This is my new EDC
4,Simple and Necessary,"I've seen some other bags at camera stores that are lead lined, but they were absurdly priced and extremely heavy. This bag is heavy, but not overly heavy. It holds several rolls of film. I put eight rolls in it, but it could probably hold a few more. It's really necessary for when you're traveling with unused or undeveloped film. Plus, the price on Amazon (and Adorama) is much lower than I found at camera stores."
1,Many better books available on this topic...,"Wading through the extreme and indulgent verbosity in an attempt to gain some self-defence knowledge from this book is a waste of time, as are most of the photo-illustrations. Find one of the many user-friendly books available that address the subject with practicality and insight. Good luck!"
1,"Good Lord, it's awful","What can I say? The technique is completely unrealistic. The prose is unreadable. ""His Holiness The Dalai Seng-Shi"" Simon can not put words together into coherent paragraphs. The stuff about psychology and crime prevention doesn't have anything to do with the real world. There is a lot of crypto-racism.And the technique. G-d above, the technique. It's lousy. It's elaborate. It requires a lot of strength and a cooperative attacker to even theoretically work. It would be a lot more convincing if it was demonstrated by women against larger men; mostly it's Simon doing it to someone he outweighs by at least twenty pounds.About the only good thing I can say about it is that the recycler took it. Maybe it will come back as a copy of ""Beauty Bites Beast"" or ""Real Knockouts""."
3,Some useful information!,I thought that it contained a fair amount of useful information that would be helpful in self protection. But I found that the author got a little to wordy for things that did not need to be. Too much detail for the average person.
5,"Terrific, on its own terms","I agree with the reviewer who said ""Who wouldn't want the box set?"" True, but when you are given this as a gift....why not! fabulous review, something for everyone, a bit of Bon Soir Barbra, TV Barbra and Movie Star Barbra.Almost anything with Cry Me A River On It is worth owning!"
1,Poor Customer Support!,"Since day one of downloading the s/w for the internet, I have not been able to get it to synchronize as advertised with Outlook (bi-directionally). I made several attempts to get this resolved with their online support staff to no avail. They essentially gave up and referred me to their telephone support staff, who then wanted me to buy a srevice ""tag"" in order for me to get help (now that this problem had dragged on past their stated 45 day warranty period). The manager of support (Howard) would not budge from his stance that after 45 days, there is phone support given without a $19 service tag being purchased by me... he did not care that their online support staff could not resolve my problems when I first asked for help. I would not recommend any products offered by this company because of thier poor customer relations."
1,Product Works Erratically and Tech Support is Poor,"I installed this product in early February and have been fighting to get it to sync my e-mail from Lotus Notes 4.5 ever since. The calendar syncs fine, but the software terminates every time during the e-mail sync and nothing transfers. I have reinstalled both the Intellisync and Palm applications, had my drives and network profiles reinstalled, and configured Intellisync every way under the sun. Pumatech tech support gave me a few suggestions, none of which worked. When I called back, they wanted me to buy a ""tech support ticket"" for $19.95 because my 30 day free tech support warranty was expired!I'm not wasting any more time or money on this product. I'll switch to something that works."
1,Doesn't work with Lotus Notes 5.0,"While this product worked flawlessly for months, it suddenly failed for no reason. Reinstalling did not fix the problem. Users with identical Intellisync settings on the same platforms had conflicting results. Upgrading to Pentium 4 system resulted in nearly complete failure to synchronize. As others noted, customer support was worthless. Intellisyn says they will not support custom templates in Lotus Notes, yet, it works on some PC platforms and not others. Easy Sync is a much better option."
4,Great Product - Still needs some work.,"We got this product to use with a Novell Groupwise mail system. It works great for most functions except memos. Groupwise has a memo system, but Intellisync will not map to it. Otherwise it has worked wonderfully for those of us with Palm and Handspring devices."
1,When it works it is fine.... BUT>>>,New issues and this stuff hangs... READ FORUMS ON INTERNETNow owned by Nokia and they have cancelled tech support. No mention of the hang problem on their FAQ's..... Wait until they get their act together
1,Horrible customer service support,"I bought this product and it worked well for a while; however, several months ago, I started having problems synching with my desktop. I lost all my information on the palm pilot and I've not been able to synch for several months now. I tried calling the Customer support line for several weeks and when I did eventually get the right number, they were of absolutely no help. None, what so ever. Based on the horrible service I received, I will never buy another product from this company."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I tried Intellisync with two different PCs, one a new Compaq.. to synch with my iPAQ 3670. The application never worked properly and worse yet it froze my PC three times. I followed the install and synch direction to the letter with the second PC but to no avail. Intellisynch did credit my account within 1 day however and were very nice."
2,Complex and unreliable,"I received Intellisync free with my organizer and had such a hard time: some of my data got duplicated a number of times, while other times instead of synchronizing, Intellisync would simply delete all records and replace them with new records. In particular, if you were to change the field mapping in Intellisync, you would see data scrambled (the country name repeatedten times but the actual address deleted)! I finally decided to buy Chapura PocketMirror (which was free with my previous organizer) and never regretted switching back."
2,Park your mammaries at home - they won't fit under these sweaters.,"I'm not a huge person. I wear things from 14-20, depending on what it is and where it's got to go.I was thrilled with 1000 Sweaters, until I realized that it had that pretty hard limitation of 40"" in all the bust sizes, for all the sweaters. Someone in another review said you could knit on it a bit and get it up to 42"". Well, I'm a 50DD, and there is no way I could stretch or knit these sweaters well. I'm an intermediate, not a knitting engineer. =)Anyway, I gave the book to a friend, someone I'd call ""willowy"". She has trouble making the patterns up due to the lack of complete plans. We have both run into trouble with the book on the ""yuppie sweater"" front, too. You expect people to have a bow and a matching vest for each one.I give the book 2 stars, because it really could have been a good idea, and the layout is great."
2,some problems,"I didn't like this book for several reasons. First of all there aren't enough sizes. I wanted to make a sweater for a friend who wears a woman's xl and these sizes only go up to finished size 40. Also, i found there some pattern problems. Ok, I'm going to get technical. At the armhole shaping on the body it says to bind off 2 sts, but on the sleeve shaping it says to bind off 5 sts. How could those pieces be sewn together and still lay properly? And, although my gauge was spot on, the finished sleeve was simply too small for the body of the sweater. It wouldn't fit into the sleeve opening. I had to seriously change the pattern to make it work."
2,OK for ideas,"I want this book to be better than it is. I bought this book years ago with the intention of learning basic sweater construction. I usually tweak every pattern I come in contact with, so I wasn't that worried about the actual patterns in the book.I made a basic ribbed sweater for my first - I thought it would be easy enough. Wrong. First of all, the directions didn't match the picture. Second, the sizing was just way off. I made the sweater to match my bust size, with the gauge dead on, but it came out way too large. I was swimming in a fitted sweater!I would only recommend this book to someone who wanted to pick up sweater ideas and who has the ability to remake a pattern with the correct measurements."
3,disappointing,"I'm still deciding whether I'm going to keep this book. It's disappointing for two main reasons: 1. All the sweaters are in one gauge (22 st/4 inches) and 2. All except for a few ""oversized"" are only as large as size 38 (finished size 40""). I'm not a huge woman, but size 38 as a large?All in all, it's an interesting book with a lot of different pattern combinations, but I wish there were options for different yarn weights and for larger sizes."
3,No schematic diagrams for sweaters,"A third reason that this book is disappointing (besides the DK yarn and size limitation mentioned in previous reviews) is that there are no diagrams showing the measurements of the sweater pieces. Most patten books and magazines include these diagrams to aid the knitter in any size or yarn gauge modifications. Without them, it is more difficult for example to adjust body shaping for a waistline to hit at the right place for one's own body. Or to shorten or lenghten sleeves. Or to use worsted weight yarn instead of DK. Generally, the concept of this book is good (mix and match), just wish it was more usable."
1,1000 Sweaters - only if you like the same gauge,"When I first saw this book - I thought what a great idea that could be helpful to new knitters wanting to design their own sweaters.However upon closer examination - all the patterns are knitted to the same gauge (22 sts/4 in as I recall) using all yarns from Rowan. In addition, the size range is very limited.If you want to invest in a book of templates to help you with design and shapes there are other books on the market much better than this one - for example Ann Budd's recent offering."
4,Nice.,They are just good pens and that's it. I was hoping the ink would be a little darker but they are not. I'll be using them for a while until I find the ones that matches my style.
4,Nothing magical but just Good pens.,"I got these about 3 days after I made the order. They are good. Simply good. I just thought for a moment that the ink was gonna be more darker, cuz I like to write with dark ink in other colors as well. I got Blue and Red ink also."
4,ink,you do not need to dip these pens in an inkwell as they somehow put ink on the tip magically.hmmm.May be the work of the devil.......
4,Sometimes hard to start?,"Round Stic bic pens have always been my favorite and these pens were on a better then department store special. I just started working as a teaching assistant and needed correcting pens. These are great pens, but sometimes they have a hard time getting started. I've spent sometimes 5 minutes scratching them on odd surfaces until they start to write. Once used for the first time, they have never failed me since."
4,Decent pen,"Does the job. An good quality for the price. Clean on paper, no smudges. Good for rough use ball pen."
5,great!,"this is a great product for a great price...thank you, i always loose pins so it is nice to find cheap ones"
3,"Writes as usual, but the pen tube is a little thinner than it used to be","The writing quality is okay, but I buy these by the box for my kids to take to school and the pen tube is a lot thinner than it used to be, these will bend and get beat up in their backpacks before the ink runs out so they've just been leaving what's left of the box at home to use for homework and we bought some heavier cased pens for them to take to school."
5,Awesome,"These were stocking stuffers for my children, and they loved them, as they do all things Dr. Who. Thank you&#65281;"
5,This a very practical and useful product,"When you want a pen that works, and don't need to make a phony impression with it's looks, this is the pen for you."
5,Pens,I love thois item I think that its an assume product I would sugget this item to all of my famil and friens.
4,Basic pens,"These are good, basic pens for the price. They write a little lighter than I am used to, but I guess all pens are different so it just depends on your preferences and how picky you are. Still, it writes cleanly, not blotty or inconsistent."
5,Excellent,This was an awesome deal compared to the prices at my daughters college for 6 of these kind of pens. I wont have to buy pens for a while.
4,My favorite color.,I guess this pens would do for a while. They are normal. Nothing amazing about them. They are just good.
3,pens,"I just needed pens for my home and my banking. These are great pens, Bic has always been a good value."
3,ran out the 4 days i got them,they worked for a four days and they ran out and there was still ink in it.oh well.thanks anyway.merry christmas
3,Can never have enough Bic's,A good investment considering being so inexpensive. Although the small size may take some adjusting to get used to I think they are very comfortably light.
3,Doesn't lock on 1D Mark III or 1D Mark IV,"Years ago Canon made a anti-fog eyepiece that locked solidly onto the 1D series cameras. You had to squeeze it hard for it to release. The viewfinder of the 1D Mark III and Mark IV are slightly longer than on previous 1D cameras so the original anti-fog eyepiece literally won't fit on them. Canon apparently introduced this longer more universal anti-fog eyepiece that will fit on all 1D cameras.However, it doesn't lock onto the Mark III and Mark IV versions of the 1D. The latches never lock onto anything. Only the friction of the latches pressing against the outside of the viewfinder keep it from sliding right off... and it will come off eventually.If you're lucky your $40 anti-fog eyepiece will still be in your camera bag when you find it missing from your camera. Someday you may not be so lucky. I keep this in a separate pocket and only use it when I need to."
2,wrong part,"When you buy something from Amazon, they give you this little idea section that says ""customers that bought this. Also bought that"" Well, I took their advice and got this item, it was the wrong size for my camera. So either the customer that bought that item and their camera screwed up or amazon messed up. BTW, I have had this happened 2 other times so i think it is amazon being very confused! BTW when you try and return it be prepared for amazon to make you pay s&h; cause they say ""It isn't our fault"".Maybe they should get the recommendation section fixed or start taking responsibility for suggesting something wrong.I never buy anything in the suggested area!"
2,terrible!,the first one was a lot better. at this point the authors just got stupid. i dont even want to read the other sequels!
3,An interesting volume - requires serious thought,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book. Each of the photos is controversial, but most of the controversy requires some background information, which the book provides. This is not a book that will shock or offend, but it is not for children. Most of the pictures are fairly tame, but it is the historical background of each photo that reveals the reason for censorship. The editor is British, and the book gave me the impression that censorship is more prevalent in the United Kingdom than in the United States. I thought the best photo in this book was the very last one, and I was pleased to see this point of view expressed, unpopular though it may be. Don't buy this book for shock value, you will be disappointed. Do buy this book if you are interested in discovering the subtle ways that censorship of photography has been used to prevent information from being disseminated."
2,Seriously....Where is Bruce?,"I haven't even bought the cd yet and I don't think I'll be going to now that I know Springsteen's rendition of ""Viva Las Vegas"" is not on the album. This is the best song in the movie and is the one that gets the movie rolling. Sure there are other great songs, but ""Viva Las Vegas"" was the main reason I wanted to purchase the cd. That's too bad."
4,Revealing the Father to his children.,"a great praise and worship CD.........Takes you into the throne room. Jesus said, "" If you have seen me, you have seen the father."
4,Journeys by DJ - Another in a great series,"Digweed, Oakenfold, Coldcut & DJ Rap plying their trade on 2 disc's. Progressive House, Breakbeat, Techno, Drum n Bass, Big Beat. Another in a very underrated series. By '05 some of this music is dated, but still a very credible release. Shag a copy of this badboy and gitcher groove on! (if you can find it!) It'll be worth the effort."
2,Should Be Called Six Ingredients You Probably Don't Have and Can't Find,"The recipes rely too much on special, low-carb products that certainly aren't available in smaller metropolitan regions (250,000 people). It also uses sugar alcohols that many folks don't handle well. As a result, many of the recipes are useless. The recipes that don't rely on special ingredients are simple enough."
1,Easy and delicious,"I found many new recipes and ideas using this book. I love that you only need a few ingredients. I really enjoyed the Almond Shortbread Cookies. They looked pretty and tasted very good. I can always detect the Splenda in most recipes, but I don't mind that. At least, I can have a cookie now and then. Have you every read Dana Carpenders books. I have them all and love everyone. If you like this book, I think you would also enjoy her books."
4,Intellgience mixed with Emotion,"Jeff Suffering has done it agian. Here you can really see his partnership with the thieves has blossomed into something magnificant.Musically the album explores several different types of generes all used to convey the tone of the song. The music is not your typical indie stuff. It takes unique instruments and truly let's the natural beauty shine.Lyrically the music is very bitter and harsh. Even when your listening to a lovely waltz the lyrics exclaim how "" I will always find a way, yes there is a way without you,"" I've been thinking of leaving you, since the day we met,""Together the album is worth the standard amazon price but if you get it used your a ot smarter."
3,It's ok,I wasn't expecting much from this product. The ears fit fine on my son...the velcro strap that goes under the neck wasn't sewn on very well and fell off immediately...
1,too big for a new born,"way too big, the costume was cool but entirely too big for my month old. three to six months would be more accurate"
4,Good costume,"Ordered the infant size, after 3 tries they sent us the newborn size because they'd run out of it in infant. Supposedly, it should fit up to a 9 month old, but the hat was small on my 4 month old. Other than that, it's a great costume, and REALLY cute. The robe fit great."
3,"Just ""okay""","The toddler size fit my 3-year-old okay. I wish the outer robe had more velcro closures, and the ears are floppy--they don't stand up as pictured."
2,Hat is infant size for toddler costume!,"I was very disappointed in this costume when it arrived. The hat/ears are too small to fit my 2 year-olds head properly (and he does not have a large head!) and it isn't as it appears in the picture. The ears flop down and won't stand out. The rest of the costume was fine, but I without the Yoda ears it defeats the whole purpose!"
4,Sizing seemed fine to me,"Based on several reviews, I decided I'd be better off with the toddler size costume for my 11-month-old. Wrong! I reordered the infant size and it was perfect. My son is exactly in the middle of all the percentiles so if you have a very large baby, maybe go for the bigger size. The fleece is very soft and warm.I do have two issues with the costume overall. One, the sleeves are very, very long - just like in the picture. This is frustrating for a little guy who has just started walking and wants to grab and hold onto everything. We ended up pinning them up a bit. Two, I would be more comfortable if the chin strap were elastic. Not a tight elastic, just something with some slight give.All that said, it's a YODA COSTUME for babies! Hilarious and adorable. We love it. :)"
4,Super cute!,"Great costume! The only downfall is that the jacket doesn't unzip all the way, so I still had to get it over my son's head."
5,Very CUTE Yoda Costume,"This costume looked so cute on my 2-year old son. He wore the ears (finally) after we told him that the hat was a ""candy hat""!"
2,Disappointed with Yoda,I bought this for my normal size two year. The robe fit but the hat was to small. People kept calling him a rabbit:(. Disappointed!
3,The headpiece problem,"The costume is so lovely. The gown is so snu that my boy can wear it until 3yrs and more. But the headpiece is so small that he takes off the headpiece for its tightness. regarding the headpiece is the key attraction of the costume, the size of it let the evaluation down"
3,Nice enough,"We just received the costume. It is a little big on our 16 months old, but she might wear it again next year.Seems fine overall, just the ears are hanging down and not standing straight as it should be and as it is depicted in the photo."
1,disappointing,"the hat is WAAAAAY TOO SMALL. lets face it, the hat what makes this costume yoda. i bought 2t and the hat is small, almost for a newborn. super duper small. sadly i just may have to return this."
1,head piece tiny,"Ok, granted my two year old has a large head, but this head piece literally wasn't even close to fitting him. The rest of the outfit fit great, only the sleeves were long, but if you're child has even a normal sized head, i'd plan on needing something else for above the neck."
4,Warm Yoda Costume,"I ordered this for my 3 1/2 year old son. I loved the fact that it was warm. Also, it was big enough to put a jacket or sweatshirt underneath. Not too long, so he didn't trip on it. The head thing though... was a little small I had to put it up more on his forehead so it wouldn't be too constricting on his throat. If it was much looser, I don't think the ears would have stuck out. Nice that it's not a full face mask. Would recommend."
4,Great Costume But Small Head Piece,"We purchased this costume for our 14 month old son and it was a big hit. The costume was comfortable for him to wear and it was easy to bundle him up underneath the robe and keep him warm while trick-or-treating. The one potential down side to this costume is the size of the head piece. Our son had an average sized head for a 14 month old yet the snap at the chin that was a bit snug. When we tried to use the costume again with our next child, who was just 8 months old (and about 18 lbs.), I couldn't get the head piece to snap without pinching his chin. This costume is supposed to fit children up to 18 months old but the head piece may be too small for some children in this age group. I suggest buying the costume well in advance in case you need to return it for the next size up. The costume is adorable and is worth the extra effort. *Note: The robe was cream colored- not brown like it appears in some photos."
4,Yoda costume is great!,"This costume is great, although I ordered the 6-12 month size and the head piece is too small for my 8.5 month old. Other than that, I love the costume!"
3,WAY too small,"Just be warned... sized 2 does NOT mean size 2T. It means tiny. Like appropriate for a 1 year old. My son is in a 2T and this rode all the way up to his knees. I had NO time to bother with exchanges, so I modified the tiny Yoda hat with a ribbon.Other than that, it was a fine costume. Just be warned that you need to get a size or four larger."
4,Good toddler costume,"I was very satisfied with this costume. It has a fleece vest attached to a long fleece robe, and a head piece. With just some sweatpants and an undershirt my son was plenty warm. Velcro closure so it was a breeze to put on. Also, dressing the kid up like yoda gives the father a good excuse to buy a light saber. Worked for me!"
4,Yoda Costume,This costume is pretty cute and made pretty good for the price. The hat is definitely undersized but the material stretches a little so I could fit it over her head. I have a big two yr old though.
2,Defective!,"I was so excited to get this, but when we had our 16 month old try on the outfit, the one arm hole was sewn shut, and it is unwearable! Needless to say, it has been returned. Also, he is of average height, and we got him the toddler outfit-the robe fit fine (mid calf) but the headpiece was snug."
1,I just can't figure out the defect,"M Y dog stands 3ft 2in in his stocking feet, and he doesn't quite fit. Granted, his knees turn from a backward opposing joint to the entire lay of the fabric runs parallel to the direction needed. But. Digress from the main complaint, which is the sheer disappointment of not having my dog pull my fighter out f the swamp."
2,Meh,"It's a cute costume and all, but the ears have no rigidity leaving them to just hang down. This of course means my son no longer looked anything like yoda. Oh well, maybe next year he can wear the robe only and go as Obi Wan"
4,Good,A little too expensive for the quality but it was ok because my son loved it and he looks so darn cut in it.
3,Infant Yoda Costume,"I received my son's Yoda costume in a speedy manner however as outlined by another reviewer, the green Yoda head and ears is very tight and almost doesn't fit my 16 month of son's head who measures well within his percentile. I would recommend ordering the next size up if you have concerns. Also, the robe is more a dirty white flannel than a cream/brown but it is nice to have the dark brown undershirt connected to the robe!"
5,Everything was great.,"Price, delivery, and product were all great. I highly recommend this vendor and this costume."
3,Newborn? Huge!,"We ordered the newborn size, and it will definitely fit our baby girl next year as well -- it's huge! She's 6 weeks old, and about 10 lbs & 22 in, so she's pretty small, and the robe and hat are ginormous on her. I compared the sizing to some clothes we have that are 6-9 mo, and 9-12 mo -- and the robe is even bigger than I would've thought compared w/an airy dress in the 9-12 size. Granted, it's a costume, so we'll work w/it, and I'm kind of glad that it'll fit next year as well, but seriously...it's just plain huge."
4,Cute but hat too small.,My son at 3 years old loves Star Wars characters thanks to my husband and saw this in a catalog. We ordered from Amazon at a better price size 2-4. The robe is mid-shin length and the hat/ears is too small to fit around his head so I will have to make some adjustments for Halloween.
5,Adorable and simple!,"I really love this costume! It's adorable, lightweight, and really easy to get on a squirming toddler! I can't stand it when a costume is nearly impossible to get your child to wear, but this one is really easy, and my son didn't even have a problem with the ears!"
5,Great and Fun Costume,"It's just like the picture, the robe and the little yoda ear hat. My child didn't complain while using it and everywhere we went he was the center of attention with his costume. Good Costume"
3,Quality,"This is one of the best books you can read for your intranet applications, it is a oranised very structurely."
2,Boring Book,Not one of the best from Ms. Howell; save your money. The characters were boring; I didn't care if they lived or not. The only reason I finished the book was because I paid for it! Boring to the last page!
4,Be aware - this is a reissue...,"At the end of Hannah Howell's 'Highland Knight', there was an introduction to her 'newest novel'. While reading the excerpt, I had a case of deja-vu. I knew the characters, the story line, etc. So I did some research, and found that this book is a reissue of a book Hannah Howell published in 1995 under the pseudoname Sandra Dustin, but the same title. I don't know if any enhancements have been made to the writing, but I don't want people to buy this book believing it's new and then find out after the fact they've read it before. In addition, this book is not related to the other novels in her ""Highland"" series. I will say that I did enjoy the original Highland Hearts novel, and that the writing, character interaction, and fast moving storyline are classic Hannah Howell."
3,Scattered brilliance,"One of the better players in the Chicago area. Seem him live many times. He has the skills and can mix it up live with funk, blues, classic rock and a little jazz. Fine to keep everyone in the bar happy but not for a CD. His strength and love seems to be power trio blues rock. Bought the CD and was a bit let down that there was no structure to it. Kinda like spinning the radio dial after every song and listening to whatever station it lands on next. To his credit he is not one to live off one sound like most other bands. You'll also have a hard time catching a better live show at the local bar. Check out his site at pistolpete.org The CD is 3 Live is a 5"
3,size,It seemed very nice and advertised that it would fit my camera but it didn't. I returned it and the return process was flawless.
1,save your money,It lasted less than a month & the cats hated it. Water got slimy after a week & eventually water fountain stopped flowing
2,Defected Product,I purchased this product because my cat prefers to drink from running water source. I bought it to replace a fountain we had for three years. This one did not even last a few months. At first I was pleased with the noise level (nice and quiet) but within a month the water stopped shooting out of the mouth. I believe the motor is defected. The only way it works if you remove the fish and with cover. Not sure if this is an isolated case but I would be wary of purchasing the Cats Rule Fountains. Too bad because they are cute!
1,I'd like to smile...,"We have a DOMKE 711-11B (used from Amazon) and are VERY pleased. This was gotten for my son 10 June 11. However, the reason for my SAD FACE...I had ordered a ""new"" DOMKE 711-11B that same day also from Amazon but have ""as of this date"" NOT received it because it has ""NOT been shipped."" Okay, chill your heals,until you read that there are ""ONLY 5 IN STOCK...order soon""!!?!! We like our used DOMKE, but never got a chance to encounter a new DOMKE. So now you know why the SAD FACE. No pictures please"
3,The band stretches over time.,"The watch runs fine. The band stretches after some months, and I will have to keep shorten/remove a few links."
4,good value,"Overall good watch that keeps accurate time and is nice looking. Band was perfect size for me and being expandable it is easy on easy off. Only down side is that there is a little play in minute hand. After pulling out stem to adjust time, there is about 1/4 turn play of stem to engage hand movement. An instruction page would have been nice help when setting up day and date. :)"
3,"A decent debut, she would get much better.","Cindy won the 1992 Dove Award for New Artist of the Year with this album, but her win was due far more to her voice than the quality of the songs. In fact most of the really good songs are on the second half of the album. Standouts are ""Let It Be Love"", which rocketed to #1 on the CCM charts; ""Love Will Break Your Fall"", one of her most powerful ballads, IMHO; and the tender album-closer ""How Could I Ask For More"", which Cindy wrote."
2,A good beginning,"This is Cindy Morgan's first album and it was enough to get listener's attention, but it pales in comparison to her later albums. There is too much production in this album, and she isn't able to be herself. She is a remarkable lyricist and she wrote some of the lyrics here, but she really shines on her latest two albums ""Listen"" and ""The Loving Kind."" I'd check those out first."
2,"Ocassionally funny, mostly falls flat.",This CD contains only random bits of humor and some downright vulgar songs! This is why only 3 of the tracks on the CD have been on the Limbaugh show. I haven't heard ANY of Mr. Silhans songs on Rush's show for quite sometime. Perhaps Rush heard the rest of Mr. Silhans CD and decided that humor needn't be filthy to be funny!
1,Short of Good Measure,"The plant hanger's were sturdy, of good manufacturer. The product did not meet advertised specification. I ordered a hanger that would reach 18""'s from my building to replace hangers that reached 15""'s to keep the flowers from touching my building. When the hangers arrived, they measured 16 1/2 inches, not 18 inches. That in a nutshell did not correct my problem and I therefore returned the hangers to the supplier. What can I say, if they had met my need, they would have been installed and worked perfectly. My complaint is directed at the supplier/manufacturer for not checking his merchandise to insure that it met advertised specifications."
1,Losing Strength,"A third of thew way thru, you will have spotted the killer and curiosity is the only reason to finish. Strange disappearance of Zee, though she wanders through sometimes. The book is weak."
3,Nitpicking,"Another day on Martha's Vineyard. I continue to play ""catch up"" with this series, because it IS something akin to a vacation on the Vineyard---old familiar characters and their exploits. It's relaxing and comforting. I do have to make some nitpicking observations on the Jackson children. If these children are ""5"" and ""almost 4,"" how on earth are they spending the entire day in school? Maybe Martha's Vineyard is far and away ahead of most public schools, but an ""almost 4 year old"" in all-day school, riding a bus no less, is pretty weird. Preschool, maybe--but I thought money was pretty tight! And time after time, JW and Zee sit on the balcony with their martinis while they hear the kids pounding down the sandy driveway when the bus lets them off. Wouldn't you go MEET the bus for such young children? Sheesh. OK....I said it was nitpicking. Just really BUGGED me the whole way through the book."
2,"Great expectations, greater disappointment","This book caught my eye in the bookstore and I stopped to read a few pages. Seemed like an intriguing premise, and I decided to buy it for my niece as a gift (so I could finish reading it myself!). Imagine my disappointment when the book degenerated into what I considered sexual misconduct, even rape. I'm pretty liberal, but when Lady Cottington was intimate with the man she clearly disliked because the fairies made her NO into a YES, that basically sounded like rape to me. I couldn't give it to my niece and had to return it to the bookstore. Such a neat idea, such a disappointing ending."
5,Brilliance! Once again genius rises to the top!,"Ever so often a brilliant writer and artist combine, Thank God it happened again with this collaboration. Abusrb becomes sublime, Un-thought of becomes 'but of course'. Thank you for a moments flight into your wonderful world, where fairies get theirs and imagination soars. Thank you for delighting me, inspiring me, stringing me along, surprising me, making me laugh, and giving me something to believe in again. Coco Dolenz"
4,lady cottington's pressed fairy journal,"it is a datebook, i thought it would be more like another book to the set, it is very pretty though."
5,A riot!,"The fairies are so cute! And those expressions and poses are hilarious.If you press flowers or know someone who does, this book is for them. They will definately enjoy the fairies."
5,VERY unique wonderful book !,"I borrowed this book from a friend, after I read it I went out and bought my own! I have shared this book with many others who have since purchased their own copy. I love this book ! The story is cleverly put together. This is a MUST have ! I even went out and bought the calendar that goes with the story. (Note... this book is not for young children, but why not get it for them when they are older? )"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"THIS IS JUST WALK AROUND THE VILLAGE WITH 2 FANS POINTING OUT PLACES WHERE DYLAN LIVED AND PERFORMED. MOST INFORMATION (WHICH, AS A DYLANFAN, YOU ALREADY KNOW) IS GIVEN BY A WOMAN WITH THE MOST ANNOYING, NASALVOICE SO YOU'RE TURNED OFF AT THE GET-GO. THE FELLOW WITH HER ENLIGHTENS US WITH ANECDOTES ABOUT HE AND HIS WIFE -- SUCH AS THEY HAD THEIR PICTURE TAKEN AT THE EXACT SPOT WHERE BOB AND SUZE DID FOR THE ""FREEWHEELIN'ALBUM COVER. HOW CUTE IS THAT? I CAN'T BELIEVE I ACTUALLY WATCHED THEWHOLE THING BEFORE THROWING IT IN THE GARBAGE."
3,Pure Academia,"This is classroom moved onto the street. The two narrators are walking encylopedias (almost) of Bob Dylan and certainly admire him. Most of the material is shot outside walking around various boroughs of NYC with narrative commentary. I missed inside shots such a Bitter End and other cafe venues as well as Dylan's apartment etc. It is essentially a visual tour and if you like that buy it.Bob Dylan - No Direction Homeis much more comprehensive in every way if you are looking for more material. But for the inquisitive and collector, this DVD does hold some value and information and would be worth the few dollars it will cost you."
1,shipping costs too much,"I was looking for a good, inexpensive plastic canning funnel, and thought I had found it.When I went to checkout, I noticed the shipping costs would be about $10 on a $2 funnel. Not worth $12 to me..."
1,Images unreadable in Kindle,"The Kindle version is absolutly horrible, the star maps are completely unreadable even under zoom. The Zoom feature will enlarge images to fit screen size at maximum, since the star maps are big and the text in it is small theres no way to make sense of the maps making the kindle version useless."
2,Alpen only okay!,"The Alpen Magnaview was inexpensive and not really worth the money spent. The image is neither sharp, nor crisp and it is awkward to focus the lenses. If I had known how poorly the image was I would not have wasted the money spent."
4,Great read!!,"Very well written, keeps you interested to the last page! There was definately justice for Selena, gone too soon! Good book for true Selena fans!"
4,after effects user,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the core dynamics of adobe after effects and some advanced features. But if you are looking for a guide to building effects, this book is not for you."
1,rice cooker,I HAVE PURCHASED TWO OF THE AROMA RICE COOKERS WITHIN THE LAST 6 MONTHS AT [a local store] AND NEATHER ONE OF THEM WORKED MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS. THEY SIMPLY STOPPED WORKING. THE PREVIOUS RICE COOKER FROM WESTINGHOUSE LASTED FOR MORE THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS.
2,great product for occasional rice cooking,"It is a decent rice cooker for occasional usage. There are two major shortcomings: one is that it is relatively hard to clean if you leave rice in it for a while since it doesnot have non-stick pot. You cannot leave the cooker on with rice in it for more than 2 hours since the rice with dry up with the sealing lid. For its price, you get what you paid for."
3,It does what its supposed to,"... The old maxim you get what you pay for is very true in this case. I used this guy throughout college and it worked great for my needs at the time.Yes this thing will burn rice, it has to otherwise it won't cook properly. I had a non-stick version of this type and it was horrendous. The hard rice on the edge would get mixed in with the good stuff and I would have crunchy bits in my rice. So when it burns rice onto the pan, thats what it is supposed to do....you have to wash the rice on these guys very well. Unfortunately when you wash away the white milky stuff you are also washing away nutrients.So the final word is this guy gets the job done, not any better than a pot on the stove though. I now have the Zojirushi fuzzy logic and that thing kicks butt. If you can spare the cash its well worth every penny. Doesn't burn any rice and rice is perfect every time. The only thing you can screw up is the amount of water you put in."
3,first rice cooker,This was our first rice cooker and it was a great way for us to decide whether we liked rice cooker rice cooked at home. We have since given the cooker to our daughter and purchased a larger one for home. She uses it at college and loves the results.
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"I was so excited about getting this rice cooker, but it's been a total disappointment! It sprays foamy water all over the place through the vent-hole in the lid, like onto the counter, the floor, the side of the cooker, you, and anything else nearby. The directions that come with it are for the larger model that has a ""warm"" cycle, so I can't tell if this cooker turns off automatically, but it doesn't seem to. It always burns the rice even though I turn it off as soon as the water quits spraying all over the room. Also, the recipe booklet that comes with it, ""Yan Can Cook"", doesn't have anything to do with this cooker. Most of the recipes, in fact, don't have anything to do with ANY cooker, and involve stir-frying in a wok or using an iron skillet or saucepan, and don't even mention a cooker/steamer. Anyway, I'm going to return it to Wal-mart and get my money back and buy a good one somewhere."
4,Love it!,"I have had one of these rice cookers for the past 6 years. I am replacing it because I shattered the Glass Lid on the floor this evening. We use it at least 2-3 times a week to make sticky rice. When I do make rice I only make 1 cup at a time (enough for myself and my husband), so we don't seem to have the ... problem ...with the overflowing. We have had the rice burn on the bottom, as a simple solution I just soak the pot with hot water overnight and give it a light scrub the next morning..that seems to work great for me. I have and will continue to recommended this product to my friends/family."
1,Poorly designed; poor quality; can be dangerous.,"The blade arm's hub protrudes beyond the top alignment bar, preventing you from positioning your paper, photo, etc. squarely against the bar. The blade itself is visibly deformed near the three screws that hold it to the arm. After only a few uses, the non-adjustable arm-lifting spring stopped working (thereby creating a safety hazard for younger users), and after several light uses the bottom blade was visibly sloped inward near the top. My other cutters lasted more than 5 years before showing signs of wear; this one lasted less than 5 months. Not recommended."
3,Padded,"As another reviewer wrote, I too would suggest you look elsewhere for an introduction to weather, probably by a meterologist. Villiers isn't really that strong on science and a few howlers have crept into the book that rather show it (p. 44 mentions -1000 degrees C!). Otherwise, it's a bit of a tedious fact dump rather than a synthesis of a wide acquaintanceship with the subject matter. I gave up after a hundred pages."
5,Blends people's encounters and experiences with wind and storms with scientific fact to make for a lively read,"WINDSWEPT: THE STORY OF WIND AND WEATHER joins others on the topic of weather but here provides an award-winning nature writer's survey of how weather has been perceived and described through the ages: wind, in particular. From wind's ability to influence world patterns and paths to how wind influences health and crime in human affairs, WINDSWEPT is much more than the usual meteorological analysis: it blends people's encounters and experiences with wind and storms with scientific fact to make for a lively read.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Generous at three stars.,"Long on appendix and on anti-God, pro-environmentalist boilerplate, and short on real substance, this book is not the best value for someone wanting to truly advance his knowledge of wind and weather. Granted there are many interesting ancedotes, and the author will deepen your knowledge of the latest advances in the science of understanding and predicting weather. But pound for pound, you don't get all that much. This kind of book keeps a publishers press running and pays the authors mortgage (on his oceanfront home). I would look for better value elsewhere if I were you."
2,Not for the casual military history reader,"I would not recommend this book to the casual reader of military history. It doesn't take long after diving into this tome to become completely bogged down in stats, unit numbers, unfamiliar geography and confusing tactics. This would be a good book for the very serious student of the SS. Anyone who loves the writing styles of say Stephen Ambrose or Antony Beever will be very disappointed with this book and will find yourself heading back to the bookstore or post office to return it for a refund or something more readable or understandable to the average reader of military history."
5,Bring these back!!!,"Love these pens, larger barrel works for me. Also purchase for my mother that needs a larger barrel to be able to grip. Believe this item is being discontinued which is a big disappointment. Just can't find anything like it."
2,Awful construction. Complete failure.,"These pens are awful. The plastic pen is terribly constructed. It's held together with plastic-on-plastic friction. If you press down too hard while writing, the top click-button mechanism pops off, along with the spring and ink barrel. You then have to re-assemble the pen by pushing it together to continue writing. If you press too hard again, it pops off again, and the pen falls apart. There's no way to tighten it.In this day and age, making a decent pen should not be difficult. BIC is definitely saving money and skimping on quality."
1,I wish I could rate this ZERO stars.,"This book is so bad that it does not even deserve ONE star.This is honestly one of the worst things I have ever read.Not only is there virtually NO research in it at all, but the writing style is childish at best and downright awful in most parts.The entire thing reads like a history report written by a grade school child who doesn't know the meaning of proper research of decent writing."
3,Are Republicans smarter?,"Although I am not sure that this author has established that Republicans are smarter than Democrats (if that was his intention) it is interesting to note that a new book has convincingly made such an assertion.Democrats and Republicans - Rhetoric and Reality: Comparing the Voters in Statistics and Anecdotesis a book that asserts that Democrats are only 75% as likely to have high or fairly high ""apparent intelligence"" according to interviewers for the National Election Studies. That contention is supported with extensive surveys and stats."
2,It could have been good,"This was a book about the New York Mets season of 1972 from a fan's perspective. It could have been good. I thought it might be great nostalgia, and I like reading about Mets seasons that weren't championships too. But the writing wasn't very interesting and often went on tangents such as the author's views on politics. There did not appear to be much if any research for this book that could have provided interesting information about the team. Also the book is written only in lower case letters. I found that an unnecessary distraction. The book ""We Won Today"" by Kathryn Parker is also a fan's perspective about a Mets season from the 1970's (this one 1976) in which the Mets didn't win a championship. Parker's book was much more interesting."
2,so not worth watching,"We loved the first Alvin and the Chipmunks so we were really excited to get this when it came out on DVD. What a waste of money and time. It was boring and dumb and so not worth watching at all. If you want to see it I would rent it over buying it, save yourself some money."
3,Not as good as I Expected,I really enjot Alvin and the Chipmunks but this one was not as good as I had expected. My 3 yr. old grandson feels the same about it. It lost his interest quickly.
4,Squeakin for Chipmunks,This is a good movie for Adults and kids alike. If you like the first Chipmunk movie then you will certainly want to watch this again and again.
3,Not as good as the original,"Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquelisn't quite as good as its predecessor,Alvin and the Chipmunks. There are a few problems. First, Dave (Jason Lee), the father figure in the first film, is unceremoniously dumped early on in favor of Toby (Zachary Levi), a loser who adds little to the film. Also, the villain, Ian (David Cross), seems more interested in being goofy than a real villain. The high school setting also takes away from the plot and seems out of place. I suspect the film would have been better had it focused more on the Chipmunks and less on the humans. That being said, this is a fun movie and should appeal to kids. The Chipettes are a good addition and manage to have their own personalities. This squeakquel will be fun, but not as enjoyable for adults as the first."
3,A FUN SQEAKQUEL THAT ADULTS CAN ENJOY WITH THEIR KIDS!,"With all the kid films that are unbearable for adults, it's nice to find films that you can watch with your children and actually enjoy! Both the original and this sequel are just such films. The stories are cute, but not so dumb-ed down that you can't stay interested in them. The chipmunks are adorable and they are funny with fantastic CGI work. This one isn't quite as good as the first film(what sequels are?), but it is certainly a very fun movie for the whole family. Too bad Jason Lee phoned this one in, it was certainly worth his time. I give this one 3 stars for adults and 4 stars for the kids!"
4,Entertaining for Kids and Adults Alike,"There won't be any Oscar nods to the cast of this movie, but my family still found it entertaining. My boys (3 & 4) love the movie and subject us to repeat performances. While the original is better, the squeakquel is worth considering. It offers music, dancing, good values, lots of humor, and of course the Chipmunks. Your kids are bound to like one or more aspects of the movie; as our did."
1,Alvin and Chipmunks new dvd faulty,Just recieved the new Alvin and Chipmunks Movie to find wont play in two of my players its very noisy and pauses during trailers and on layer change stops and cant get going.The disc looks clean so it must be warped.Will be sending back for replacement.Purchased this through Amazon have printed out return details which is great.
5,Excellent movie,I received this product in great condition with nothing wrong with the movie. I was able to watch the movie and had no problems watching it. I really liked the movie and would see it again when I want to.
4,They're missing on the opening!,"At least on the digital copy - haven't put in the BD yet. In the theatre, when the FOX spotlights appear, the chipmunks were singing in place of the trumpets. Why would they remove that from the iTunes version?"
4,Grandchildren loved it,"We've seen the movie twice and the grandchildren, ages 7 and 3, loved it both times. They were dancing in the aisles. Good, clean, fun movie. They still watch the first movie and I will be buying this one when released."
1,it would not download,We purchased this video while we were in a hotel with our 2 young grandsons. It would not download. So we were unable to view it.
1,The first was much better,"The first movie was cute. It had a good story. It featured good music. It was worth owning on DVD.The second one just doesn't live up to the first. The story is drawn out to cover the span of the movie. This leads to a fairly boring movie. It tries to pick up a bit in the middle, but I was already considering shutting it off and returning it to Redbox.My child thought it was 'cute' but ocnsidered the story too slow. It made it hard to concentrate on the story. The story of the former producer out to get revenge really started to grate on my nerves after a while. Small kids might find this movie fun, but I just can't recommend it."
1,PLEASE NO 3DEQUEL!,"Unless you're a kid, there's nothing to recommend this movie. The chipmunks and chippettes become irritating after about 30 seconds. The ""music"" is cookie cutter pop and Zachary Levi and David Cross are just awful. While the original chipmunks were novel n the 60s, they're obnoxious in this millennium!"
1,Poor quality DVD,"I pre-ordered this DVD for my 3 year old because he absolutely loved the movie. And, as his mom, I was pretty much into the movie as well. When the DVD arrived I think I was more excited than my 3 year old. I put the DVD in the player and the player started making a terrible vibrating noise. Well, I thought it was the DVD player, although on a few months old. I attempted to play the DVD in two other players as well as the computer's DVD player and none of them worked either. For the players that attempted to play the movie a loud vibrating noise was occurring. I took the DVD out and it appears to not be 100% level - so it is a little harped. Not fretting too much, I went to a store nearby to purchase a second DVD. I got it home and it too appears to be a little warped. And, the unfortunate results of this story is that I now have 2 unusable DVDs that I can't return because both have been opened."
1,Video does not show in library for viewing.,I ordered the video and clicked view later. The video does not show up anywhere for viewing. The $3.99 was collected though. When clicking the link I see a pane where I can order it again. I do not think I want to go $8.00 in the hole.
1,are you kidding,"This was almost as bad as the 1st which I'd give a minus 3 I only saw it in hopes it'd go into the Chipettes oragins. It didn't in fact rather than bother to go into anything close to the classic cartoons values it centered around compitition, some nitwit cousin and a few sight gag. the only redeption at all was when Alvin did risk his life to protect Theadore from a bird of prey.. Frankly my cat could've writen a better story.For you who want to introduce your kids to the chipmunks who had comedy and values try the Cartoons that are now avaiable on DVD. Don't waste time or money on this tripe."
5,Loved it!,"My 3 year old loves this movie...& has watched it numerous times. Oddly enough, for a kids movie, it isn't bad. I catch myself watching it with him. I think the songs are what holds his interest! It was definitely a great buy."
5,Love it!,My nieces love the DVDs. Especially the sing along. They call it Alvin girls how cute! I was able to get the DVDs quick enough for my nieces birthday!
5,Great dvd!,"We now own all of the chipmunk dvd's,and we love every one of them! Great family movie! Worth every penny!"
5,excellent,this was bought for my 5 year old nephew has been having this movie for a while love chipmucks cant get enough
3,"Son loves this movie, I think it's 'fair'.","My 22 month old can't get enough of the chipmunks, so this movie is perfect for him. As far as for adults, I think the saying is true that sequel movies aren't as good. ""Dave"" is only in the movie for probably 5 minutes total! Introducing 'girl' chipmunks (the Chip-ettes, as they call them) who are identical to the boys- in personality, shape and size and even what they wear...a far stretch for entertaining I think. And, maybe it's just me, but I think all the chipmunks are a little harder to understand what they are supposed to be saying. Overall, my son who obviously can't comprehend the movie loves it- so good movie for kids. For adults, in my opinion...just so-so."
5,Chipmunks Forever,"I am more in the senior citizen category and I got this movie for my grandson to watch when he is with us. We also have the first movie. The only problem we have is that we have to limit him to watching the movies only once a day, otherwise he would watch them over and over and over. They are great entertainment for the young and he just loves them. I also enjoyed the movie but stopped watching after the first dozen times."
4,Amusing movie,"This is a funny movie, although not quite funny as the first Alvin movie. I was pleased with the speed in which I received this movie."
3,Not as good as the first movie...,"It was nice to have the ""guys"" back again in this squeakquel but the movie just didn't live up to the hype or the first movie. It needed the character Dave to be in it more and maybe Claire (Dave's romantic interest). The swapping of guardians, the plot that didn't take the time to really go in depth with any of the story lines, trying to explain all the new characters, and too little music just really took away from the movie and made it seem kind of hollow. I didn't like the style of music the Chipettes sang or how they sang the music. The Chipmunks were great in the first because they sang classics with a twist.It was still interesting to see being a fan of the first movie and the kids may get into the movie but for an adult it was missing sold plot points. The people producing the movie tried to do too much in too little time and ended up doing not enough too much of the time.Unless you have kids, would be better to rent or borrow than buy."
1,Overly simplistic and poor graphics,"When you compare Plotkin's book with those written by David Kay and Diane Koers for Paint Shop Pro, Plotkin simply does not measure up. Some descriptions and instructions are very good, but the photo examples are of poor quality -- in a book about photo editing! While there is definitely a need to supplement Microsoft's meager instruction manual, this book on Digital Image Pro 9 does not do enough to fill that void."
3,Cute bed but.....,"We bought two of these beds for our twin daughters about 2 months ago. Within about a month of them having them they managed to pull out the bars the mattress sits on! This bed might work for a child that is laid back, But not for my two. We're going to buy them a twin bed!"
3,great music for a good cause,"the best among these cuts is madonna's 'supernatural'. she was still doing that cheeky combo of latin beats and saucy lyrics. she also still had that tight, closed sound to her vocals that made her voice distinctive. damn that seth riggs for training her out of her style!because this was a sony release and george michael was a sony contractee, he is the most featured artist on the disc. his contributions, save 'too funky' are not very memorable.the remixes aren't bad, especially 'change' by lisa stansfield. but there would be more and better suprises with later red hot discs."
3,Best description: ADEQUATE,"As other reviewers have stated, the strongest cuts ARE those contributed by George Michael, an artist whose news-making sexual activities placed him in, what best can be called, ""musical leprosy"". However, when he was in the limelight, he did shine brightly and the three here exemplify why he was hot.The other jewel is Todds CD Mix of Sly & The Family Stone's ""Thank You (Falettin Me Be Mice elf Agin). Adding a heavier bass line reinvigorates a true classic.The remainder of the album, however, doesn't cut it. A weak Madonna entry and other lifeless remixes seem to contradict the terms ""red, hot, and dance""."
4,A good text in anthropology,It suggests a theortical framework for explaining many cultural beliefs.
4,Great combo,"Yep, it replaced my USB Keyspan Vista remote control. I like the fact that you can customize the buttons on both the remote and the mouse which is tilt and span. Love it, looks great, works great. 3-1 product"
2,Beautiful but painful,"I've had my teakettle for 5+ years. It really sits on my stove for decorative purposes but about once a holiday season, I need to boil water for the coffee press. The whistle is pleasant. However, the handle gets incredibly hot even though it is well out of the way of the steam and the handle attachment point is well above the water fill line. I've burned my hand on it. My guest have burned their hand on it. My wife has burned her hand on it. Each time, people don't expect the handle to be hot but it's hot as an iron. I've got the burn marks on my palm to prove it. I write this review telling future buyers that if you are an occasional teakettle user, this thing will burn your hand. I also write this review to make sure that I don't forget how &$^@! hot this handle gets. Maybe I'll just give it away. Sigh."
5,Seinfeld Loves It,"Ever since I saw this Chantal Kettle on Seinfeld I had to have one. The classy design is enhanced by the harmonic, non-intrusive whistle and the stay-cool handle. If you go through tea kettles like I used to I recommend investing in a Chantal; a teakettle with class and staying power. Oh yes, it boils water just fine."
1,Junky whistle,"It is both outrageous and perplexing that a previously reputable company like Chantal (I do have some great Chantal pots that have served me well for many years, and I love them) would stoop so low as to have rusting parts in its kettles' whistles. Message to Chantal: If you can't equip your kettles with working whistles, get out of the kettle-selling business."
2,Harmonica whistle sounds terrible,"I bought this tea kettle because of Chantal's reputation for quality products and because I fell for the ""harmonica"" whistle. The whistle is terrible, though (sounds like a train horn in a tunnel), and the kettle itself is rather small. Would not purchase this again nor recommend it. It is being sent back. (It is, however, attractive.)"
2,"Looks great, poor performance","I bought this high end kettle thinking I would get a reliable tea kettle. Although it is beautiful, the handle gets extremely hot and requires a pot holder to pour the water. The tea kettle gets stains from my gas burner and this requires extra maintenance. Lastly and most disappointingly was that the kettle leaked from the pour spout only 1 year after I purchased it. For the price I paid, I thought I could get at least 7 years out of it. I would not recommend purchasing this kettle. I'd look for something more reliable for a more affordable price."
1,HAZARDOUS,"This can be a VERY DANGEROUS teakettle. When full of water, the handle broke off. Scalding water everywhere. If you like visiting the ER, buy it."
1,For decoration ONLY,"I bought this kettle for looks and that is all I got. It gets so hot as to be unusable and I had to make myself a little sleeve to put on the handle to even hold it. The finish has not held up well and even though I use commercial stainless steel cleaners and polishes it still looks horrid. In general I do not recommend Chantal products - I have had two saucepans that held up well, but a roaster and stockpot have been huge disappointments. If you actually want to USE your kitchen utensils, I would avoid this brand."
1,Chantal Tea Pot / Poor Choice,"I got talked into buying this $100 tea pot and it seemed to work fine for a while, maybe because my range was electric. But recently with my new gas range I hate this tea pot. The obvious problem is that I have burned my hand on the HOT handle! Now when I pour it always ""dribbles"" water down the front and onto the counter no matter if I pour slowly or fast. I actually thought that there was a leak in the seam of the spout where it meats the body. Slightly hard to fill up because you have to hold the handle and aim the water past your hand holding at an angle. Very disappointed in this brand. But now what do I buy?"
4,Nice design and works well,"I was searching for a more retro style tea kettle but I didn't trust buying an old used one. I decided on this kettle because I like the design. I was specifically looking for a kettle that had no plastic...which I think makes anything look cheap and ugly. I would have preferred an explicitly retro design but I think this is a great purchase anyway.The whistle doesn't work, but I bought it for the design and didn't even know it was supposed to have a whistle."
3,chantal teapot,"Very nice teakettle, but there's no plastic on the handle so they give you a potholder to slip on after it's boiling to pick up the teakettle when it's hot. I was disappointed in that. I almost returned it, but decided to keep it. Every time I use it I'm mad that I have to slip the silly handle potholder on. I wouldn't order it again."
5,Love my Chantal tea kettle!,"I have had my lovely shiny grey Chantal tea kettle for about six years now and I still am amused to hear the harmonica sing. I manage the handle easily, it pours fine, and it's fun to show friends. I've never regretted spending this much money on this classy kettle!"
1,Did not even make a sound,"I tried a few times and could not get this to whistle. Also, I handle is way too hot. I am returning it."
1,No Good,"Extremely boring and nothing funny about it all. Perhaps a nine year old might find this funny, but I doubt it."
5,Watched Several Times: Still Laughing,"We have literally watched this probably a half dozen times and still laugh at it. Funnier than movie/TV bloopers, these are mishaps that often went out on the air over live newscasts. I have the VHS version, and if this is the one with the ostriches checking out a newsman, that one alone is worth the price. We loved the segment where the cameras went crazy and did things they weren't supposed to."
4,My Naked Soul,"I loved this CD. Terisa Griffen has a very wonderful voice and I don't know why she is not more widely known. In Detroit, there is one radio station that plays her song, ""Anymore"", but they never say who it is. I heard it about four times before a friend of mine went online while it was playing on the radio and found out who it was. I immediately went on the internet to find the album and purchased it. I have no regrets."
2,"Please, stay away! It will eat your wallet!","This printer is pretty good I guess. But its slow and when is time to buy ink, you will be asking your self.... ""Why did I buy this printer"". Trust me, there are better choices out there."
3,The best thing about this printer is that it looks good.,"It is pretty noisy. When printing, it shakes like a wet dog. It keeps forcing me to press the select button when I'm low on ink, for each and every print job. The quality is good (when there's lots of ink), but it prints VERY SLOWLY (about 10 ppm in b&w;, and 3-4 ppm in color).And I can't save the software to a folder I want. It has to choose, and then it copies its files to a separate directory. If I delete either one, it refuses to work. Then I have to reinstall the drivers.This cost me $159 brand new. I have to buy new cartridges every month and it's costing me around $1000 a year, JUST FOR INK!-EDIT-I want to lower the rating to 2 stars, but it won't let me."
1,Way too confusing!,"I had to read this book because I love Seaquest. But beware, this may be one of the worst books ever. It actually is two small stories that have nothing in common, combined into one. This author needs some writing lessons; the entire novel is written in about 3 paragraph segments, jumping between anywhere from 3 to 5 sets of characters throughout the story. Only read this if you need a Seaquest fix and are truly desperate!"
1,Terrible,This was a poorly written historical novel. It wandered all over the place and left out critical material. I would suggest removing it from your inventory!
2,Not Meaty Enough,"I thought I had left a review but in looking back I haven't, so I will. I was REAL disappointed with this book. I spent a lot of money on it because I was excited to learn about the Bourn's, but the book left me with very little knowledge. Possibly there was no reason to write a book about them, but there just wasn't anything to sink my literary teeth into."
5,"A treasure, a gem for the Soul!","In a world where most news is bad news and there is so much fear, this CD is a ray of hope and light.Ellen Edwards' music touches our hearts with meaning and depth in her lyrics and melodies. The arrangements beautifully compliment her songs. She vulnerably sings of the loves in her life; her children, husband, friends, and her world.The music is varied; some of the songs are upbeat and some are more ballad-like. Some to get your feet tapping and others to just sit with and experience. There is a lot of fun and joy here!Ellen's songs are especially valuable in a world of so much apathy and empty performance. Her music is honest, personal, rich, and significant. With depths of emotion and gifts of her love, this CD will speak to your heart and soul. A true gem!"
3,very good quality,workes very good but the head is not self leveling and the upper pins are sloppy so i repaled the with bolts to titen them up
1,Burned the rice everytime!,"A huge disappointment. It burned the rice every time we used it. A defective model? Maybe, but we'll return it and try another brand."
2,Wish it didn't burn so often,"I'm pretty disappointed with this product. It frequently burns the rice on the bottom of the pot, and the various suggestions in the instructions for avoiding this (oiling the pot, warming the rice first) don't seem to help very much.The steamer racks are great - I love being able to cook rice and steam vegetables without having two extra pots on the stove.Buying and using this product has sold me on rice cookers - I used to doubt how useful they are. Still, I'm not sold on *this* particular model. We're going to do some shopping around and try to find a different brand that doesn't burn our food!"
3,Why Tester?,I want to purchase a large bottle of my favorite cologne Loewe's Pour Homme which I usually obtain from El Corte Ingles when I am in Spain. How come when I buy product in the States through Amazon or any other on-line purchase I end up with a Tester bottle? Sometimes they come with tops and sometimes without the original box and packaging but it is always a tester bottle. What gives? I feel cheated that I am not receiving the real deal. Can anyone explain?ThanksRicchard TejeraMiami
4,Good Box,This is a very good box for the price. It has a low profile and a small footprint. Definitely good for a set of everyday watches.
1,Poor quality in all regards,"DON'T BUY THIS BOX!! I ordered it about a week and a half ago, and was extremely disappointed. Having bought 3 identical sized piano black glossy boxes from this company (Watchmaterial) about a year before, I was staggered at this new version. It is lightweight, poor (cheap) Chinese construction, and the watch pillows are old school at best. They are hard rectangles, and will not conform to bands and bracelets that have been sized. The old boxes used to have dark grey charcoal color soft velour pillows that would easily fit all bracelets and bands. Apparently, Watchmaterial has decided to save a buck or two, and ship out poor quality merchandise. Well--there are other purveyors of high quality watch boxes!"
1,problem with product,The product I received came in time but was damaged. The latch did not work and a divider was broken as well.
4,Love it,I feel like Kimora Lee Simmons with this diaper bag. Of course I only use it when I am not needing a super practical bag. Dont mind paying the $40 bucks to feel a little glammy.
4,Cute,"Not as compelling as the book, 'Watercolor Fairies: A Step-By-Step Guide To Creating The Fairy World.' But definitely a must-have for anyone who enjoys Faeries and wishes to illustrate in this manner. I consider it a fantastic resource, but I would definitely recommend purchasing the above mentioned book as well - they work superbly as a pair, and you don't need to be interested in Water Color for it to be helpful - it's an utterly amazing book covering everything you'd want to know about Faeries and more!"
2,Well ... two and a half stars,"Overall, the book was interesting. However, if you're actually planning to use this book to learn how to draw faeries I'd think twice before spending the money. The book has all kinds of drawings, but not much instruction. And -- hello, it is a book about faeries -- I thought there would be at least a page or two describing how to draw faeries' wings. Nope."
1,Try Something Else,The front cover picture is deceiving as it was the best picture in the whole book! I found the pictures to be mediocre at best and I am sure there are better artists out there. I also thought it did not include enough pictures. The Watercolor Faeries book looks much more interesting.
2,For the more experienced drawer,"I bought this book for my 10-year-old daughter, untrained in drawing, but when I received it, I knew it wouldn't work. There really are no step-by-step basics. This could be a great book, I'm guessing, for someone who already knows how to draw and wants more info for bringing their drawings to life and fleshing them out.I do have to nitpick, however, on the title (as did other reviewers). I suppose since faeries aren't real-world creatures, there can be different interpretations of precisely what a faeire is, but this book doesn't conform to what the general interpretation is: a WINGED creature. Faeries without wings are pixies. Nearly every ""faerie"" in the book is wingless; possibly a minor point, but one worth pointing out if you are interested in details like different wing styles, wing attachment to the body, etc."
4,The manly-man review,"This book so amused me when I saw it in the bookstore that I knew my wife would get a big kick out of it.It has inspired her to create wonderful works of art.The author covers the basics of fairy anatomy, and also intermixes it with some amusing fictional 'facts' about faeries.Even if one is not an artist, this book is entertaining."
3,Riddle Me This,"What do you call a fairy without wings? The answer: an elf. The title of this book is misleading. I expected to find numerous illustrations of fairies, but instead all I got were elves with pointy hats. Throughout this entire book I only came across *nine* illustrations of fairies. There was nothing that went into detail about fairy wings or various kinds of fairies. I wasn't really blown away by Hart's book because there was nothing new or exciting. Even though this book offers instruction on how to draw bodily features and environments of elves, I wouldn't recommend using this book alone if you're interested in fairies."
2,Drawing Fairies,I thought this book would have more of an easy step by step guide for drawing. It is more of a book for people who had have some artistic training.
2,Wrong Title,"Nice enough drawing book, but NOT A FAERY BELIEVER'S GUIDE.This book is about fairytales drawings, NOT FAERIES!Again, a dissapointed purchase about misleading information on the description or title. The book is all about fairytale characters, not about Faery art, and certainly not for believers. It's only for childrens story books. And even then, just a small reference book with several drawings for each character, not a serious drawing learning book."
5,Great drawing lesson,I think this a great imaginative book for anyone wanting to create a fantasy world with Fairies. The book shows how to draw the characters with the correct proportions and details. It is easy to understand and teaches good solid drawing tips. I highly recommend it for all ages.It is a great addition to my library of Chris Hart drawing books.
4,Drawing Faeries,"My niece loves to draw, especially anything having to do with faeries. This book starts out with a great story about the artist meeting a faerie and then goes in to detail about drawing them. The only thing I think is missing is detail on the wings."
4,Great service!,The item that I requested came in a timely manner and was in excellent shape! Thanks!
4,A New Sound for Joan,"...though its more orchestration than pop.I adore Eleanor Rigby among the other hidden gems in this oft over looked album. I enjoy it, adore it and recommend it!"
4,Joan Baez at her best.....,"My review partially relates to the MP3 download as offered through Amazon. Though the sound is clear there are faint, muffled rattlings apparant on the transfer. The overall result is adaquate for casual listening but I'm prejudiced in favor of my LP recording that was purchased 1n the 1960's and still sounds perfect. The selections and arrangements were done with great care. The listener's attention is invited to drink in the sweetness of Joan's clear and unhurried voice. The efforts of the support performers results in a shimmering expression of music. This is my favorite recording by Joan Baez."
3,great performance--terrible audio engineering,"Baez is one of the greatest folk singers ever to come along. Her performance on this CD is superb. However, the transition from LP to CD is sadly lacking. It is one of those cases when someone is trying to put something into the sound that wasn't there originally. Track 4 (The Dove) is a perfect example. The snare drums come in sounding like raspy tin cans. If you can get your hands on the LP, it is well worth it."
4,"If You're On The Fence, Get It","I bought mine for use on a rebel XT. Between that smallviewfinder and the poor ergonomics of keeping my faceagainst the back of a tripod mounted camera, I was gettingworn out trying to capture anything from a sunset to amacro subject. this little beauty solved all that. And,I like that I can flip a lever and get a magnified viewto help in manual focusing.For me, it was well worth the money."
4,Great item,This is a must have item for any one taking low pictures. Also is great for keeping your face away from the view screen
2,sloppy adapter springs,"As a wildlife photographer with a stiff back and neck I was looking for an alternative to my skimmer ground pod and whimberly gibled head for low angle shots with my canon 1d mk III /500mm f4 set up. Being able to set up and look down would relieve my back problem and allow for low angle shots. When I first put the angle finder on the mk III it fit ok however the second time it was very loose and i found it difficult to use and lost many good shots of a group of shore birds until i took it off and discovered that the springs were very loose. I pushed them back into place with my finger which improved the fit but any adjustment and the adapter loosened up again. Others have reported this same problem. The optics seem ok. I would recommend this for a static set up but not for any dynamic subject. Note, the box that contained this product is labeled made in china. All of my other canon product boxes say ""made in Japan""."
5,seal cement & muck boots,I had an almost new pair of muck boots that had been cut off of my son's feet after an accident -I was able to glue them from sole to top making them watertight and completely usage again. Great product!
3,"""site of a para""...",or 2.5 stars for this weird 80's film. the dvd vid. quality should have been better; not enough monster action as i thought it should have by seeing again now. demi moores' 1st film; i saw this 1st in college when this came to theatres believe it or not. cooler to see this in 3d & theatre.
3,It wasn't what I had hoped it would be.,"If you are buying this CD to hear Garrison Keillor talk, you won't be disappointed. He also sings a few solos. Unfortunately, the CD, a recording of a live performance, did not contain many of the traditional favorites that I've enjoyed hearing the The Hopeful Gospel Quartet perform on various broadcasts of A Prairie Home Companion."
4,A LOT OF FUN ALONG WITH GOOD MUSIC,"This is a mixed quartet singing old gospel favorites, for those who have grown up on them and also some new ""original"" songs. I really enjoyed the ""Hymn to Sweet Corn"", and his comments on his puritan ancestors."
3,Good but a couple of bad spots,"I love Garrison and the Hopeful Gospel Quartet and most of the songs on this CD. However, two of the songs were a little muffled. Perhaps it is because they were taken from a live performance that in itself was not the best taping quality. Looking forward for them to do another."
4,Too much talkin' and not enough singin',"Despite being critical of the talking, this review is moved to rate this album four-star worthy because it is good listening, especially while driving in the car."
5,classy piano,"Enrique Chia came to my attention at a restaurant in Aruba.What a pleasant change from the ""usual"" stuff of overhead noise.I HAD to ask for the information on the piano music. The cashier showed several CDs used. Four or five were by Enrique Chia.The selections are melodic, original, familiar and varied.Great stuff compared to what is usually out there."
1,Almost useless for the exam!,"I took and passed the 70-221 exam yesterday despite buying this book. There is very little technical information here and if you have passed the the core exams on Professional, Server, Network Admin, and Active Directory, then you already know more than they tell you here. Secret to success is a good test prep simulation like Transcender. The forms and information collection methodology presented here could be useful in a real design perhaps but have little or nothing to do with what is on the test."
2,"Good foundation, but a poor format.","While the information in the book is revelant and provides a good foundation for study, the format leaves much to be desired. Especially cumbersome is the lab format, which requires a great deal of writing and can only be graded with use of the included CD. This makes it difficult to study on the road. This is a good study guide, but it should not be your only one."
3,Reference book @ Best!!!!,I passed the exam but it had nothing to do with the contents of this book. The other reviews are pretty insightful and I would look to only add this. I like this book for reasons outside the exam. I am a consultant and I always strive to find information useful in helping me prep for a new design or somehow enhance my documentation. This book for me was useful in that respect.For exam prep I would also have to recommend a study aid tool. As much as I like to REFRAIN from mention study aid tools by name I would say invest in the transcenders for this one. I did and was successful.
3,Not strong,"Bought this to replace one of my Jeep's worn out and sagging exhaust hanger bushings. Unfortunately, it's not quite strong enough to hold up the weight of the exhaust without sagging, which defeats the purpose of replacing the worn bushing to begin with. This will work for a smaller car with a lighter muffler, but using it on a Jeep's heavy steel stock muffler is a ""stretch."""
1,Warning - part not as pictured,"Ordered two of the identical item from Amazon. Both arrived in the same box but are distinctly different parts - one is all rubber and looks just like the part in the picture, the other does not have the intermediate webbing and looks to be rubber laminated over a metal core. The kicker is that both parts have the identical part number on the plastic packaging - so this seems to be an issue of consistent supply, not necessarily Amazon's fault. Physical dimensions are very close but the ""elasticity"" is way different - the all rubber part having (as would be obvious) way more ""give"" than the rubber/metal part.So in summary, let the buyer beware - probably best to look at these physically in a local autoparts store than buying them online from Amazon."
2,"Ok, but not that good","It only has 30 degree field of view at 21 mm and that is EXTREMELY narrow. Too narrow to be of any real use in finding anything. That is why I returned the item and instead bought seperate eyepieces which I think are better, even though you have to change them out. I don't think a beginner like me would realize this at first but I quickly realized this is NOT what I wanted and my $60 would be better off going to better individual eyepieces."
1,First One Didn't Work,"I checked the unit when I recieved it, to make sure it worked. The first night that I was able to use it, the unit was stuck on 21mm. Since it took over 30 days to get a good night for viewing, I didn't think that I could return the unit for one that worked. I came here and vented my frustration and gave the part a low rating.I then contacted Orion Telescope and they exchanged the stuck unit for a new one. I haven't had a chance to take the eyepiece out and try it, yet, but I'd give Orion 5 starts on customer service."
3,Not entirely satisied.,"I have to admit, I'm not entirely satisfied with these Bic pens. I just got them, and the ink doesn't seem to last very long, and isn't that strong. If I push the pen across a piece of paper, it often won't make a line all the way across.Still looking for the perfect ballpoint pen."
1,"Pens leak, average review is deceiving, i would not recommend these.","So I bought these pens thinking they would do the job based on the reviews, but it turns out they have been so irritating I'm going to return them. They leak ink onto the paper and onto your hands and it's extremely frustrating because when you try to wipe it, the ink just smears and makes an even bigger mess. I've never had any trouble with pens like these before and I would not recommend these nor purchase any more pens from bic in the future because of these pens. That is all."
4,"Great little book, but...","I was given this book by a friend and my 2yo loves it. This book is so sweet and simple, yet is not too complex for kids just learning how to manipulate objects and their environment. I do wish that ""Baby"" came in a variety of skin tones. (We had to make ""Baby"" a sibling.) That would make this little book perfect. OH...and some Scotchguard!"
2,The Big Letdown...,"Believe me guys, I am a fanatic of Classic Outer Limits, I remember when my Mother would not allow my brother and I to watch because we couldn't sleep later that night...anyway, the story was very original, but it just crumpled to nothing, it started with a bang, but why would a man with a beautiful wife do that to himself, and he did it all for nothing, I mean it's like the writers got tired of writing because the second half was very disappointing, and the ending...please, a waste of human life.."
3,Clarinet reeds,"Rico La Voz Bb Clarinet Reeds, Medium-Hard, 10-packThe reeds have an ok sound, but unless they are really wet, they do not sound right. I couldn't get the sound I was looking for, but that might be because my clarinet is not a professional model."
3,Lonesome Entrepreneurial Consultant,"In March of 2004, I left a high profile job just to see if I could make it from scratch bottom on my own. For the past nine months, I built a solitary consulting practice on the second floor of my house. Each day as I worked, I would listen to the New Age station on AOL Radio (now an XM version) - the most pleasant, satisfying, but non-distracting radio I could find. Each day, John Adorney's cuts from ""Waiting For The Moon"" came on at various times and they each stood out for me. I would turn up the sound, sit back - and enjoy my freedom.Thanks, John."
5,Cartoon Network PC video game,"It's an awesome Cartoon Network video game! It's an old one but it's the only PC game from Cartoon Network. So, if you are a Cartoon Network fan you should buy it. (Unfortunately, it's not soled on Cartoon Network Shop)"
5,kids humor!!,my son read one of these when he was like 8 or 9 and still remembered it at 11 years old so when we saw one at the thrift store we got it. We had to order a few more online because he liked them so much. It is not a devotional or a book with any scripture (not that I saw!) but it is good clean silly humor that kids enjoy!
4,Graet series,I love all the books in this series. They are funny and easy to read and each book is a story in itself. I am collecting them all and have read about 10 or so. This is a great book for grades 4-6.
5,An amazing book!,"What an amazing book! John Minor Botts tells the history of the Civil War from his personal perspective -- what could be better? Although his language is rather flowery at times, he makes his points clearly, giving dates and names to take you back in time. Although he was a Virginia slaveholder, he was a loyal Union man. I am so thankful that his story is still available for modern readers."
1,Increase Your Score in 3 Minutes a Day: SAT Critical Reading,"This was a horrible book. My teenager would not read it -- very boring. I wish I had not bought it. There are many other SAT prep books out there that are better, but I was intrigued by the title of 3 minutes a day."
2,Don't bother,"As a tutor I bought this book thinking I could use it for some of my students. The book is too short and what there is consists of vague generalizations, and cutesy comments. Some of the quotes are funny, but there is too little of substance to justify buying this over the many other SAT books available."
4,Classic Historical Work,"Originally published in 1871 after the Author spent 8 years in Paraguay as a U.S. Diplomat and later U.S. Minister to Paraguay in the 1860's - including part of the 'War of the Triple Alliance'.The History of Paraguay combines well researched facts on the emergence of this fascinating country with personal accounts of those who witnessed independent Paraguay's torturous past.While the information presented in this book is truly inestimable, it also offers its own historical value in the way and times it was written."
4,Great Irish Music,"If you are new to the genre of Irish music, or just to the Dubliners and Clancy/Makem, then I would suggest this album. The selection of songs is great. Just remember, this is a Drinking Songs album. Don't expect any ballads. A note to Clancy/Makem fans: the tracks ""Tim Finnegan's Wake"", and ""The Moonshiner"" along with the introductions to ""Juice of the Barley"" and ""Jug of Punch"" are all previously unreleased material from the album ""In Person at Carnegie Hall"""
2,Horrible Service,"The shinai itself is great. The quality and craftmanship is flawless. However, it took me 2 months to recieve this item. After the expected dates of recieving the item had passed (a month), I checked the UPS site for my package and it said that the item had been returned to sender 3 weeks prior. I was NOT made aware of this. After a few awkward emails to the seller, i recieved the shinai about 3 weeks later. a whole month after the expected date of arrival."
1,Don't buy used,I bought this camera used. I took one picture and the camera never worked again after that
1,clunky and awkward...returned it,We have been looking for a good counter top compost bucket. This one is heavy and looked difficult to keep clean. Attractive from the outside but it would get broken easily in my house.
3,great but breakable,"The compost keeper was great, until the lid broke when it slid off as I was taking it out to empty, but now it's a lovely vase. The lid never sat down completely in its place. It is also little small for our compost needs, but it was beautiful while it lasted, arrived quickly, and we'll probably purchase another. We'll go for something more durable though, like stainless."
5,FINALLY I GOT ONE,"Before I purchased this compost keeper, I was using a plastic container and it was driving my wife nuts. Its very attractive (enough to place on your kitchen countertop), and does not smell nor attract those pesky fruit flies."
2,Compost Keeper - Too Small,"The container seems to keep the ""stink"" to a minimum but boy when you open it, you can sure smell the rotting stuff! My wife says it is too small, but I think it fits under the cabinets pretty well, but it needs to be ""emptied too often""-- which I guess is the size issue."
2,Handle falls off,"Our's broke as well (The handle fell off)! It was nice while it lasted... Purchased the Oggi Countertop Compost Pail with Charcoal Filter, Made from Eco-Friendly Bamboo Fiber as a replacement. Much better!"
3,Don't trust the handle.,"This attractive compost pail is very effective at controlling odor and having a convenient receptacle for compost materials in the kitchen makes composting much easier. However the handle cannot be trusted. It will slip off the handle knobs, fall to the floor, shatter into sharp pieces and spill your compost everywhere on your clean kitchen floor. Put up the extra money and buy the stainless steal model."
4,Does the job for me!,"Like the other reviewer I find the handle comes off all the time, but I didn't mind the look at all. It is virtually odorless, even when almost overflowing, and I stick the filter right in the dishwasher from time to time. I have only handwashed the crock, but it is easy to care for. I'm happy with it, and am not making hardly any waste since it arrived."
1,Gnat haven!,"Before purchasing the Norpro ceramic compost keeper,I stored food waste to be composted in a plastic tub...no problems, but not as good looking as the Norpro product. However, the Norpro compost keeper is a haven for gnats. I never had this problem before - now they swarm in and out of the compost keeper. I don't know if it is because the lid isn't tight or if the aerated cover lets them nest inside. Whichever - it is not something I would ever recommend to anyone!"
2,Unpleasant experience the first week,"This seemed a good Christmas present for my wife (believe it or not) who is a composting afficcianado. However. the ceramics are not made uniformly. The lid was not perfectly round, and the seal on the lid came off every time we used it to the point that we have left it off. I will be contacting Amazon to replace it with either one of the same that is produced in a uniform cylinder/circle... or give us another type that actually works. We are tired of the odor, one week after Christmas. I guess made in china connotes what I thought it would.. and this is made in china."
2,Poorly designed,"Used this item for about 3 months. One day, after rinsing, I grabbed the metal handle without realizing it had lost its ""connection"" and the 2-piece compost keeper became a 100-piece compost keeper. Worked as expected prior to that. A definite design flaw. I feel I wasted $20."
3,"Norpro 1 gallon ceramic compost keeper, white",This item is okay but not great for me. What's not great is it does not have a full gallon capacity and I find the handle inconvenient as it comes off very easily. Perhaps it was made to come off for easier cleaning; however it is difficult to use when dumping the contents into the compost pile. The up side is that it is attractive and easy to keep clean and the filter part works very well.
3,Broken top!,"I received the Red compost keeper as a Christmas gift this year and loved it! I could throw anything in it and smelled nothing. I would throw it in the dishwasher every couple times I emptied it and it was good as new.My two complaints are about the lid. The knob on the top is very small and not easy to grab--especially when you have wet slippery kitchen hands! The lid slipped out of my fingers multiple times, but the last time it shattered. I don't know where to get a replacement lid for my very new crock. The other trouble I had with the lid was the silicone gasket came off when I washed in the dishwasher and it never fit quite the same."
3,Condider design issues before you buy this one,"Others have commented on problems with the handle and the weight of this item. I agree. In addition, the plastic lid gasket would not stay on, and we quickly lost it despite efforts to keep track of it. (It's now somewhere in compost heaven but may reappear in the pile next spring.) The gasket helped to keep the item tightly closed and air penetrating only through the filtered holes. When this breaks (and it will), I'll get something else--most likely from another manufacturer. Until then, I'll use it cheerfully but carefully."
2,Ceramic Composter,The composter is difficult to empty . You need 2 hands to do it and not get the material all over. If it had a plastic liner with handle it would be easier to carry out.
5,Great compost pail,This pail looks good enough to sit on my counter and there is no smell from it - putting the entire bag in my compost pile is wonderful.
2,a mess to clean,"This product is good in theory. It does the job. Pretty much as advertised. What they don't tell you is it is difficult to clean. The lip of the lid inside has a crevice that goo gets stuck in when you dump out the food scraps. Think egg yolks, in a crevice. Nasty. You can put it in the dishwasher and that really cleans it good, but it is so big that it takes up a lot of room in the dishwasher and do you really want to do that every time? Not very environmental. So now I usually just use a small bowl which is already dirty so it is one less thing to wash and small, instead of one more big thing."
5,Kitchen composting,This is a nice addition to my kitchen. It makes it much more convenient to add trimmings etc. to my compost. Prevents my lazy habit of throwing things directly in the trash. One good tip would be to buy the compostable bags to make it even easier!
2,Terrible design,"The footed bottom, while decorative, catches all kinds of mess in the bottom and makes it difficult to clean. Also, it is very heavy, also making it difficult to clean. Pretty, but function suffers."
2,handsome; poor quality,"Somehow my first one broke. I assumed my fault and boughta second--they do look nice. Now, after 2 years it has developed three cracks inthe sides and a crazed bottom, definitely not my fault. I'm afraid it will fall apartwhile I'm carrying it outside. I will get a stainless steel replacement before thatmess happens."
2,Not sturdy!,I've had this compost bucket for a year and really liked it. I kept the filters fresh and never had a problem with odor. It looked nice on the counter- that is until first I chipped off a 2 inch hunk from the bottom rim while emptying it in my large compost bin outside. I was able to glue it back together and turn the bad side toward the wall. Yesterday I bumped it against the counter and got another huge chip in the base. Now I'm replacing it with a stainless steel one.
1,Impractical!,"This compost keeper is way too small to be usable. I would fill it up twice a day! The ceramic is too heavy and the top requires the use of two hands, difficult to do when in the midst of cooking and food preparation. Its ended up as a dog food receptacle."
3,worked for a month and then broke,"I ordered the red one and was happy with it initially. It looks good and keeps the compost stuff odor free. But the handle has a poor design and it eventually killed this item. During my last trip to empty the compost bin, the bin dropped to the floor and I was left hanging with the handle. The bin broke into 5 or 6 pieces and I am now looking for a new compost bin. Definitely not this one again as I am sure I will break it again. I could have been more careful, but a ceramic compost bin with a poor handle just doesn't work for me. I owned this item for a little over a month (well, I still own the lid and the handle, but the bin is now in trash). RIP."
