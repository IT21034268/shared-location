5,Great SOundtrack,"this is an awesome sountrack. I especially like Spiders by System of a Down, Wait and Blled by Slipknot, and Crowded Elevator by Incubus. I highly reccomend this CD."
4,Almost A Perfect Rock CD,"The opening riffs to ""What If"" by Creed stick in my head all day after I've heard them once. I got this cd yesterday and i must say, it's one of the best soundtracks of the decade. Highlights of the album are: ""Creed- What If"", ""Slipknot- Wait and Bleed"", ""System Of A Down- Spiders"", ""Coal Chamber- Tyler's Song"", ""Dope- Debonaire"", and ""Creed- Is This The End"". Also the songs by Finger Eleven, Sevendust, Full Devil Jacket, and Orgy were awesome songs. Now, the terrible songs are as follows: ""Static X- So Real"" ""Godsmack- Time Bomb"" ""Powerman 5000- Get On, Get Off"" ""Ear2000- Click Click"" (no offense David Arquette)I like heavy metal, but, trash by Static X doesn't qualify as music. Any songs I didn't mention were pretty average. I think that overall, Scream 3 is a winner. But, there are pieces of crap on it that should be skipped if you like music. You might have a different opinion. This is what I think."
1,WTF kind of joke is this??,"Having seen SCREAM 3 a year ago (closest I can figure), I loved the movie and I saw the soundtrack at the library today..The first thing I noticed when I looked at the track listing is that only 4 of the songs in the movie are on the soundtrack CD, and for the rest of the album, what do you get? the rest of the album being bonus tracks having nothing to do with the movie!The SCREAM 2 soundtrack is good because all of the songs in the movie are in the soundtrack. Meanwhile, for this CD, System Of A Down (my fave band to this day) and Slipknot (ewwwww) had nothing to do with this!So avoid this soundtrack at all costs."
4,Great Metal Soundtrack,"This is probably one of the better soundtracks out. The new Creed song ""Is this the end"" is a jewel and Sliknot,PM5K,Fuel,Staind and many other great bands provide great songs for this awesome Soundtrack.I highly reccomend it."
3,Think twice,"I bought this CD because of the tracks by Creed and Slipknot and because I was interested in the other artists. I spent about ten minites listening to it in the store and then I knew I had to have it. I love the first half of this CD, but hardly ever get through the second half. I would recommend this CD, but would suggest you think of buying the CD's of specific artists instead."
3,"Good, but doesn't compare to first two soundtracks","Both the Scream 1 and 2 soundtracks featured a wide variety of artists and music. Though the SCREAM 3 SOUNDTRACK does include many great heavy metal songs, it lacks the imagination. If you are into heavy metal, then it's your dream album. By the way, where's Nick Cave's song, Red Right Hand?"
3,Edwardian Hats: The Art of Millinery,"This is likely to be a book with appeal limited to those of us who are fascinated by vintage fashions, including their construction. I am finding it to be a technically useful book for creating reproduction hats."
4,helpful but confusing,it's a handy little calculator but it isn't intuitive to use. Still trying to figure out how to store daily totals. Also wish fat and saturated fat were on the same calculator.
4,Great for keeping track!,"I don't use this anymore, but when I was keeping strict count of my calorie intake, this was my best buddy. It's very portable and entry of food is simple to do."
2,I gave it away,"I didn't like it, was not easy to use was not easy to add a calorie count and if you did and wanted to use it had to put in the asterisks. Gave it away."
2,Wireless mic has static with it,"Brought 2 items few years back. Always have statics when I try to utilize both of them, have contact problem within the mic that the power always off. I would not recommended if you try to buy 2 for the cheap price."
1,I recommend other movies instead,"If you are looking for a ""new baby"" movie for the 2 year old range, I would recommend ""Arthur's Baby"" over this one. My son finds ""Arthur's Baby"" much more entertaining."
2,Gold Mining - Should Not Have Bought,"A disappointing buy. I must have made a mistake while looking through the info because I thought it will be something about modern techniques, with color pictures. Instead the only colour was the cover. Rest of book was monochrome, illustrations are not very useful."
4,nice collection of early LSH comics,This volume contains lots of older comics that I had never read before. The book is good quality and looked brand new. Good quality replication of the original comics.
3,"A pleasant, innocent read","Comic books have matured considerably in the years I've been on the planet, but Vol. 4 of the archives is a trip to an innocent era, when stories could be somewhat campy instead of on the edge and the artwork merely servicable rather than striking.D.C. has put a lot of thought into these archives, assembling the Legion stories that appeared in other comics in addition to their regular appearances in Adventure Comics. For me, it was a pleasure re-reading many of the stories I read as a boy, but I could see where this collection wouldn't thrill current comic book fans, accustomed as they are to explosive stories, occasional profanity, and suggestive dialog. For me, this was a good buy. Young children would certainly enjoy it. For others, perhaps it wouldn't be worth the money. For the comics book fan who wants to complete a collection of stories he will probably never be able to puchase if he could even find them, this is something he must have."
3,***READ BEFORE BUYING THIS CD***,"Although this CD is Michael Buble who does have a great voice, and shows to be a big star some day, he DID NOT wish to have this CD released! This is what he had to say about it himself:""Totally Buble"" is not an album that I wanted to be released. They were songs I recorded for a film called ""Totally Blonde"" many years ago before I was signed to 143/Reprise Records. The decision to release it as an album was made by the film's producer, and I had no control over stopping him.It is important for everyone to know, that I only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and I sincerely apologize if you purchased this album."" - Michael BubleBut, if you are a fan of him and enjoy whatever he puts out there, it would be a good one to add to your collection."
3,Depends On Your Taste,"If you are a Michael Buble fan and like his renditions of ""up-tempo"" swing style music of Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin during their Capitol years, then you'll like this ""new"" CD. However, don't be fooled. This is NOT a new CD by Michael Buble. It seems to be session recordings for a movie soundtrack called ""Totally Blond."" The producers or who ever owns the rights to these songs pressed a quickie CD to cash in on his popularity. The songs are short and they could have done a better job on the sound. I happen to like the way he sings that type of music, but some of his younger fans may not. So, if you can't get enough of his voice and like straight forward ""Big Band"" style arraignments, then give this CD a try. If you're expecting something like his first CD, then pass this one up."
3,Buy his debut album instead.,"It's a good addition to your Buble collection, but not as good as his debut album. The songs aren't too bad and are actually quite likeable, but it just doesn't have that good Buble quality."
5,Just tooooo short,"the music was OK, and Bublé does as well as he could with what he had to work with. It was just much to short, although the video stuff was excellent. And Bublé does have a fantastic sound"
1,taking advantage of buble the wrong way,here's a case of a someone trying to capitalize of someone's good name. don't buy this if you care about fair artist treatment.
2,Wasted space,"Don't waste your money! Gees, what a disappointment. Yes, Michael Buble is a fantastic voice. Why, oh why, didn't they fill the other 45 minutes with something. This CD is only 17 minutes long. Give us more of the music like his first CD. Sorry, Michael, they done you wrong."
5,I just LOVE this !,This C.D is an excellent pick for anyone intrested in good quality music. I find it to be very romantic.
2,Poor Quality,"First, the CD only runs about fifteen minutes. The quality of the recordings is very poor. Otherwise, the songs are good and Michael Buble has a great voice."
1,listen to Michael and you'll know why.........,"I love Mr. Buble and his voice and respect his talent and wishes........ Reading many reviewers posts and going onto his website myself to see his reasons for not supporting this cd, I see that he was not in agreement with this cd being released as it was and because of that, will not support or purchase this.. So listen to the man himself and don't support this."
3,Definitely worth $5...,"In spite of Mr. Buble's disparaging remarks, the songs weren't bad at all. Especially considering it was his first outing."
2,Disappointing,"The is the first CD I've bought that iTunes/Gracenote has no clue about...Then I listened to the CD to see if it was good enough to be worth the effort manually enter the data - the answer is No!Michael Bulbe is a great singer - this CD doesn't do him justice - go buy ""Crazy Love"" or one of his other CDs instead."
3,Early performances,Great album with a few normally unheard performances including a good swing number but sound quality is a little lacking and performances are not as polished as his later works. Love Buble and wanted to add this to my colleciton but it's not in the top 5.
2,"Buble' great, cd not.","As a Michael Buble' fan, I was really disappointed to read his caution about this cd. He said something to the effect of ""I did not want this released"" as it was taken from a movie he'd starred in. The movie folks obviously are just trying to cash in on his rising fame, choosing a title like Totally Buble' implies that it's all about him, when it is apparently all about the movie folks trying to cash in......not fair is it?The songs are poorly written, although I have to admit even with poor writing Michael makes them sound pretty good. I bought my copy before learning of the truth and now wish I hadn't. Save yourself the money and at the same time, don't encourage folks to try to cash in on an artist."
1,michael got ripped off,"I would not go out and purchase this c.d. on the basis of it having nothing to do with Warner Bros. or Michael Buble for that matter. I have heard it and as always Michael's voice is wonderful. But people look at the dates of this album being recorded and check out the name of the record label..This is typical of what happens when a wonderful voice is out there and people try to make money on it. Like one othe reviewer mentioned in this section, don't blame Michael for this he has never given his O.K. or even talked about it at any shows or on the radio. Obviously if he endoresed it or had anything to do with it he would have at least mentioned it. So stay true to Michael and only buy c.d.'s that he talkes about. Their is many bootlegged copies of his live shows out their now too. Beware. A Michael Buble fan for ever"
5,Frank Sinatra Would be Proud,"Michael is amazing, his voice carries that light and airy feeling of a newly renovated Frank Sinatra. His vocals are distinct, yet familiar. The CD is incredible, everyone should own a copy. Bring the Rat Pack back!!"
2,Ho-Hum,"I simply adore Buble but this wasn't really worth the money. Be sure and pick up ""It's Time"" and ""Michael Buble"" WAY before this album. I haven't ever seen the movie, but I'm guessing its one of those enjoy-the-music-during-the-movie-but-not-necessarily-after-it situations. Of course, Buble sounds good but the songs don't really do anything for me."
1,Estos productos no me han llegado aún.,"Estimados señores Amazon.el día 26 de diciembre 2010 encargué por intermedio de ustedes la compra de varios discos de Michael Bublé, lo cual a la fecha de hoy, 28 de diciembre de 2010 aún no los he recibido.Agradeceré que me den las explicaciones del caso, ya que se encuentra esta compra cargada en mi tarjeta de crédito"
3,Everbody has a beginning...Not to shabby I might ad,"While this CD may not be his best. It is what it is. Many up and coming artist regret earlier less then perfect productions. Nothing new about that. It is called the road to success. This is a earlier performance that was featured in a movie, it show cased his talent- what could be bad about that. Let's not be so serious about whether it is a 5 star or not.I personally think it's great. Maybe we should thank the producer."
1,too bad they did this to Buble...,"Listening to this cd it is no wonder that Buble did not want this released and this company did so against his wishes. Obviously they are just trying to cash in on the good Buble popularity but it won't work when we all can hear for ourselves. You producers should have called this a sound trak to the movie, not tried to make it sound like it's all about Michael. It's all about money to you and the quality shows."
2,Don't waste your money,"The songs are good - however, the cd is very short. If you play this in your car cd player, you get 16 minutes worth of music - that's it folks. Sure, it has 3 bonus videos but it's the same music as one of the 7 songs on the cd. Makes me think twice about buying future cd's by this artist."
1,tricked,sadly i feel tricked....yes michael buble can sing but the cd is short and the songs are not so good. reading other critisims posted i see my feelings are shared.
3,Critic of this Album,He should have interspersed this album with a few of some old standard ones that he hadn't recorded. He's known best for his arrangements on old standards. These song are to new on this album to hold their own.
2,A bad trip off the train of success,"It seems not too much effort was put into this album - rather, a quick knock-off of Michael Buble's debut cd. For first time Buble listeners, definitely buy the debut album. The great voice and style captured on the debut album are completely lost on Totally Buble. Totally not worth it."
2,It's a rip off,"I bought this CD because Michael's first CD is great. This one only has 7 cuts with 3 so-called bonus songs. My normal equipment won't allow me to hear the ""bonus"" ones. He has a nice voice, but I wish I hadn't bought this one."
4,Very cute but not good for teaching beginners,"My 2 year old daughter loves this video. She actually will sit and watch it all the way through. It has little girls dancing and dressing and being exciting aobut it all, and she loves to watch them. They show footage from professional ballets and even show the girls in the video doing a stage performance....all this is great to spark interest and help my daughter understand the whole world of dance a little better. However, if you are looking for a video to begin to teach ballet I would choose another one. The video assumes that you already know what a Plie is and goes right into a full fledge dance. It dosent start from square one as far as form and postition go."
2,could be so much better,"Unless your child is at least, perhaps, seven, and has ballet experience, I think this DVD will mostly be frustrating. It attempts to ""teach"" some pretty complex choreography, while posing as a DVD for younger children. It does have some moderately fun warm ups and glimpses into a ballet school, but the majority of it, the dancing, is really far too complicated for little children. This could be simplified and made enjoyable to a wider range of kids."
2,2 hard and too short,"This video is not for beginner dancer with less of 5 years old. I bought this video for my daugther of five years and the first part is to hard and too fast for a girl that never took ballet class, and the second part very short of class, because the most of time is speaking about the ballet academy in others part of world. She saw only one time and never wanted again. very sad..."
4,Good product; keeps kids moving,"I bought this DVD mainly for my 3.5 year old ballerina wannabe, but it ended up drawing in my 7 year old and myself! We all had a great time trying to follow along, and the narrator's voice is encouraging and soothing. This is, I believe, a British production. If your kids watch Angelina Ballerina, you may notice a similarity to the ""real life"" segments of that show. Well worth the cost and I am sure will be watched in our house for some time!"
4,Hope replacement lasts as long as original,First Insinkerator HOT ONE lasted 16 years perhaps because water supplied post reverse osmosis treatment unit Suspect lever a bit more flimsy than original model so family warned to use with care. Price very competitive from AMAZON
1,Poorly Constructed and Short Life,"We purchased this Hot Water Dispenser (junk) two years ago and the first problem was the noise. After the first year the cheap plastic faucet lever broke ( a very poorly constructed faucet) leaving us with no other means of using the dispenser. We eventually found a way of forcing the water lever up to operate the faucet. Then the heating element burnt out and no hot water. InSinkERATOR was a DIFFICULT INSTALLATION! We have since purchased a KitchenAid. OH NO! Another disapointment, but EASIER INSTALL. And FINALLY WasteKing, YES! YES! YES! Another VERY EASY INSTALL!"
1,"Un-dependable, poorly constructed junk","I had two of these go bad on me at two different residences. Use cycle of the faucetbhad been very low on both of them, perhaps a hundred gallons each over several years.When they fail, you have steam and scalding hot water spewing about so it is not fun.Will not use these ever again..."
1,You get what you pay for,"In 9 years I have had 3 of these. Until recently, the customer service department actually sold me a replacement for less than the going retail price. I guess they had to stop that practice based upon all of the problems evidenced by the number of terrible reviews. Now they tell you to buy a new unit. Unfortunately, once you install this unit, switching to another model or brand involves a new more complicated installation. There are no other models the size of the HOT1. If you figure that this unit, at best, lasts 3 years, it makes more sense to buy a larger more expensive unit that would last longer and have a longer warranty. There is a reason that Insinkerator only gives you a 1 year warranty with this unit."
4,Long Life!!!,"We are in the process of purchasing this unit to replace our prior unit (same model) which has just burned out. We installed the first unit when we built our current house in the summer of 2002, so we got just a little under ten years of good usage from the unit. I am willing to try it again. I will turn the water temperature down slightly as suggested by one other reviewer who feels that doing that extends the life of the unit."
4,They don't last forever,"This is my third instant hot water heater in 24 years.First lasted 16 years, second (like this) lasted 8."
4,Great for the price,"I had the more expensive model (H770-SST) In my last home and it was no better and much harder to install. This one is simple to install, and so if it lasts only 3 or 4 years, so what. That is excellent service for a product that is on 24-7, I think. I am on my second one (in 11 years) and am now ordering another for when inevitably I must replace the one now in service."
1,cheap black handle,"DON'T BUYI didn't use this InsinkErator instant hot water very much, but the black handle still broke off with normal use so I can't use it anymore. Also it was noisy."
1,Don't buy!,"Bought about 2.5 years ago. Factory setting about 140 degrees, way too cold for tea, so must be turned up to maximum. At higher temp the tank slowly fills with vapor. If the unit is not used hourly, the tank will first need to be vented, then allow 10-15 mins to reheat, to be able to dispense about 8 ounces of very hot water. This is quickly followed by cooler water. Not exactly instant and not very practical for two or more simultaneous servings. Perhaps due to higher setting, tank corroded and ruptured in less than 2 years. No warranty service. We're using the Waste King offering. It also had to be adjusted up from a cold factory setting, but it does provide instant delivery of 12-16 oz of very hot water."
4,Works great,"I had one of these in my house when I bought it, but it did not work. I bougt a replacement and it worked great for about 2 years or so and then the tank started to leak and no way to fix it. I bought this replacement and was a pretty easy installation since it was exactly like the old one. Hopefully I can get it to last longer than the 2 years everyone seems to say it lasts. It is a time saver for heating water and is one of the cheaper costing ones."
1,Cheapest Insinkerator Instant Hot Water,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. I'VE HAD TWO PLUMBERS AND TWO INSTANT HOT WATER DISPENSERS. BOTH OF THEM AGREED THAT THE PLASTIC PARTS WERE NO GOOD, IT LEAKED BOTH FROM THE BOTTOM AND SHOT OUT HOT WATER FROM THE NOZZLE. IN ADDITION YOU NEED QUITE A BIT OF CLEARANCE TO LOWER THE LEVER WHICH I DID NOT AND THE NOZZLE DOES NOT ALLOW ANY CHANGES. THIS IS A TERRIBLY DESIGNED PRODUCT, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A FRANKE OR A KITCHENAIDE."
1,Not pleased.,We bought this unit a little over two years ago and it sputtered and popped hot water from the very beginning. About six months ago it stopped working entirely. Our new one is another brand and I confess I am very disappointed that a good brand name like InSinkErator would produce such garbage.
1,Leaking InSinkErator Instant Hot Water Dispenser,I have just spent the better part of the day cleaning up the mess that was created by this instant hot water heater. It damaged the sink cabinet and all it's contents. A hot water kettle such as the Aroma AWK-115S 1-1/2-Liter Hot H20 X-PressWater Kettle from Amazon is a much safer and more energy efficient solution. Do not install this in your home unless you like leaks.
1,I'm looking for a replacement,"I installed this item myself. After about two years the plastic handle broke. I was actually able to find a replacement locally at an appliance repair store. But here in Albuquerque the water has a lot of dissolved solids that wind up in the tank, gradually building up and fouling the lines. Eventually, after about 4 years, it simply wouldn't pass enough water to make it worth the hassles. We unplugged it and I've been looking around for a replacement item. I will not buy this model again. The next step up, the H770, seems a much better deal, but I can't get it in the finish I want to match the rest of our kitchen fixtures. I'm looking at the Series 1100 but it's much more expensive."
1,hot water plus plastic parts equals a waste of money,"We have this in our office kitchen and it's super handy when making hot cocoa,tea, oatmeal etc. We've had to replace the plastic washer/nut because the hot water/tubing literally melts it away and the unit begins to leak and the dispenser begins to fall apart. Now the replacement washer/nut is melted to bits so we're going to have to replace it AGAIN. I'm going to try to find a different unit because this one is just too much hassle."
1,DO NOT NOT NOT BUY THIS,"I read the reviews of this product only after having it installed by a plumber. It constantly has to heat water due to poor insulation and made a lot of noise when it heated water -- so loud it will wake you up at night. Worse yet, it rusted through in only a year and a half and leaked all over our kitchen cabinet. This company appears to make decent upper-end products, but this is trash and should never have been put on the market. The price may appeal to you, but you will regret your higher electricity bills and lack of sleep and need for extensive repairs that will follow if you buy it. I know this is a downer review - something I usually avoid, but I just wish I had read the other reviews before this was installed."
5,CAN NOT BE WITHOUT,I was very happy with this product. It does a great job. Mine started to leak and needs to replaced it is 7 years old. That is about right for today's appliances. I will most likely replace it with the same.
2,insinkerator hot-1 inoperable after about 3 years,"I have bought 2 of these units. They work great for about 3 years and then you have to replace them. I have good, low iron city water. The first unit leaked. The second one would spit steam when dispensing even when the water temperature came out at 185F. If you want to spend about $45us per year for hot water then the HOT-1 is for you. Me, I am going back to a tea kettle"
5,Great!,"i actually bought this unit from lowes and was a little bit worried about all the plastic. i had it for over 5 years but nothing broke. and i worked it good! it did do the sputtering and squirting thing but only in the 6 mos to year. mine died from the extremely hard water we have here, so i thought five years was good. the tank has a nice low profile and fit below my 3-bowl sink with all the other stuff that comes with that."
5,Hot-1 Instant Hot Water dispenser,"This is our second unit, and I admit that it has spoiled me for instant hot tea no matter what the time of day is. I also find it handy to use hot water for my instant soup rather than the microwave. It is faster, and with much less mess."
2,Does not do its job,"I replaced an old one of the same model, but have had continuing problems with the new one. It does not heat the water, and retain it for the requisite time for a single cup of hot water. This was the second one received, as the first one leaked immediately after the plumber installed it."
1,don't buy this model,"I am currently looking for a new hot water dispenser to replace this one. It has sputtered and leaked water since I got it. It has never worked correctly. It has scalded me a couple of times- sputtering water out of the spicket. It also makes a lot of noise. I have a guest bedroom under the kitchen, and need to unplug it when guests come, because it wakes them up, everytime it kicks on."
5,Ilove it!,This globe is beautiful. It is worth the price. I love how it looks in the garden. I also like that it is made out of stainless steel. I highly recommend it. Shipping was really fast as well. Get it! You will love it!
3,Gazing Ball,"I received the ball in a timely fashion,but, in the picture it shows a small metal attachment on the bottom. There is no metal attachment with the ball. There is just a small hole there."
5,Big Time Hero.,"During this past winter my wife's gazing ball was broken during a storm. She was very disappointed. I bought this blue (her favorite color) stainless steel gazing ball and she was surprised to receive it. I was her ""Big Time"" hero. It is of good quality it being stainless steel instead of glass, it really holds up to the weather. It's a great product and the price is right. You can't go wrong with this merchandise."
5,BEAUTIFUL GAZING BALL,"ALL THE ONES I HAVE SEEN IN GARDEN STORES ARE MADE OF GLASS, THIS ONE IS STEEL AND LOOKS GREAT , I LOVE IT IN MY FRONT YARD...SHINES NICELY AND IS THE PERFECT SIZE,VERY WELL MADE"
5,very pretty,"Nice packaging, nice solid color. Was very pleased with this product. It was a gift, so it was doubly important that it was as stated."
3,Nice,VCS PSD12 Mirror Ball 12 inch Purple Stardust Stainless Steel Gazing GlobeFlorida Sun too strong. Ball fades. Will try some car compound or auto wax on it.
1,Magic Ball no Breakage,"This stainless steel mirror garden ball adds a touch of magic to my backyard garden without the possibility of breakage. Other glass gazing balls have not weathered a full season, but this one will add color to my garden throughout the year."
4,nice shades for guy's with big heads,These glasses are great for the money. If you have a large head like myself this glasses are exactly what you need. Very dark so not the greatest on a cloudy day. I would buy again.
4,Nice Knife Packaging is VERY Tacky,"While this knife is a nice one, be sure that you have alternate packaging if giving it as a gift. It comes slopping around in a large white box wrapped in what looks like a hamburger wrapper."
3,decent,"This book is not terrible and provides a good overview and introduction to assessment. The previous reviewer of this book could not have been more wrong about grades. Actually, research shows grades are a horrible predictor of success when controlling for other factors (income, socio-economic status, etc.). Research also shows there is *no* link between a grade and what someone has learned. This is because grades are relative and measure an individual's performance at one time, although I will admit that using multiple methods and more numerous testing will increase the validity of grades. If tied to the learning goals of a course, grades can be effective. But as a policy making tool or measure of what someone has learned, grades really don't say much, if anything at all."
1,This book is a cure for insomnia,"Unlike the book, this review will be pithy. Purely out of academic necessity I am required to read and utilize ""Knowing What Students Know: The Science and Design of Educational Assessment,"" for a class in the masters program in which I am enrolled in the area of Educational Management. The authors go to painstaking measures to demonstrate their knowledge of a subject that could be explained in half the amount of words and explanations. The book makes the subject matter more complicated than is necessary. It turns a dry subject into a veritable Sahara-like atmosphere."
4,Very nice anklet,"This was exactly what I was looking for, I love the soft jingle and that it adjusts to fit."
5,LOVE THIS!,"When I found out that Entertaiment Weekly was putting out a compliation of greatest hits of different decades, I couldn't wait to get them. When I saw this one at my local K-mart and saw that a song that I really wanted on CD(""No Myth"") was on here, I bought it immediately and was not disappointed. Sure, I have half the songs on this CD on other CDs, but I still like it. Hey, it even has ""Ice Ice Baby"" on it...a cult classic(HA HA)!"
1,Only One Decent Song,"An utterly dreadful look at an admittedly horrid year for popular music. Michael Penn's magnificent hit ""No Myth"" is the only bright spot here and it makes much more sense to buy his album ""March"" (which contains that song) rather then this mess. At least there you will be guaranteed that there will be other songs you will listen to."
4,great book -- gets you through the basics -- quickly!!,"similar to the dummies series, the idiots version was proofed a little more carefully before it went to press. A wonderful book for beginners or experienced computer buffs who want to get the basics out of the quickly"
5,Great product,"Great product! My plants really do well when I use as directed. I love the excel, it helps to remove the black algea and keep it at bay. Will e buying more of this product when I'm out."
5,Movie collection,"Great episodes, including some I had never seen; just had read the books. David Suchet is Hercule Poirot."
5,Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection,"As always, Hercule Poirot starring David Suchet, is the ultimate Hercule. No one does it better. This is a great collection and although we had some of the DVD's already from the ACORN series, we love having 12 in one box. A great buy and hours of great entertainment!"
5,excellent,I have always enjoyed Agatha Christie's Poirot. The Definitive Collection is one of the most entertaining of the series. I would reccommend it to whomever enjoys a great mystery.
5,Should get 10 stars!,I can't say enough good things about this collection. If you've ever read any of the Poirot books you'll know that David Suchet IS Poirot. He was born to play this role. The sets and costumes are beautiful and the supporting cast is great too. I missed these stories when they were on PBS. So glad they are out on DVD now.
2,Wondering about the Homosexuality?,"As much as I love Agatha Christie and these Poirot series, I have been surprised at by at least 2 episodes in which homosexual relationships are wound into the plot. I do not remember this being in the books. ""Cards on the Table"" & ""Five Little Pigs"" (I think that's the title) added material and even made it crucial to the plot to use specifically homosexual relationships. Why?"
5,Christie's Poirot is a must for mystery lovers.,This is a wonderful collection of Poirot mysteries. Many of them were unknown to me. This set is a great addition to my collection of mysteries.
4,Poirot Collection,Great collection of Poirot but I wish I looked closer - I really enjoy the shows with Hasings in them and this collection is not the ones with him in it. It has one or two but the majority is Poirot alone. That being said it's still a great collection.
3,Why old TV format?,"The film making, adapted stories, and of course David Suchet are great. But why does A&E put these out in the old 4:3 TV format when the originals were filmed in widescreen 16:9?"
5,A Mystery Lovers Dream,An excellent collection of Poirot movies that will entertain over and over. Great value and great entertainment. Highly recomended.
3,OMG too many variations...,"OK, I'm among the Dazed & Confused.I love Hercule Poirot and David Suchet is brilliant.I now own 59 titles between Acorn & A&E.;Does anyone know where to see the whole list of what is available on DVD?And does anyone know when these will be available:Appointment with DeathCat Among the PigeonsHallowe'en PartyMrs. McGuinty's DeadThe Third Girl"
4,"Great collection, but buy the european version if you can play it","Great collection as always. However in the US version (Region 1) the format it 4:3 Full Screen, which means the picture has been cropped from the original European version (Region 2) which was shot in 16:9 Wide-screen. If you are into cinematography this is a big deal and sometimes the cropping is pretty awful. It still great TV though!"
3,Okay shoe,"I know the description said ""pointed toe"" but from the picture it didn't look like it was quite so pointed. It's okay, and for the price I feel I got a good shoe, but i would have preferred a little less point to it. Al"
2,Compatibility isssue,I took a class to learn how to use the product. Even with good instructors I found the software complicated. Now I've made peace with it and would like to transfer it from my laptop XP (that I took to class)to my new Dell Desktop running Vista. Nope. Adobe offers a patch to make 5.0 compatible but not 4.0 and apparently does not plan to do so.
3,Decent but room for improvement,"I use this software primarily to make desktop wallpapers and other graphics. I love the magic extractor tool to drop out backgrounds. Once I got used to the tool I found it much easier than just the lasso because you don't need such a steady hand. However, I would like to see some additional features, like more shapes and a better help manual (the current one is awful. I find myself googling all my questions because the Help function is useless). It also baffles me that I have to hunt online to download additional shapes, gradients, patterns, etc. Why can't adobe just offer these themselves? Maybe I'm nieve but I think it would be nice if they had a section on their website where users could share any shapes, gradients that they have created for FREE. I can't believe how many websites want to charge a person to download some shapes. Anyways, great software with hopefully some improvements in the future."
1,Not Worth the Cost,"I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived!I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost."
1,NOT A WORTHWHILE UPGRADE,After loading the software I tried a few of the new features and found some of them to be quite useful.The ability to view thumbnails easily and catalogue has great potential -- perhaps more so for a hobbyist than a professional with thousands of images. However there is not much that one could not already do with Elements 2 and a curves plug in. I believe Elements 2 is a great product. The response and performance of the version 2 is adequate. All the Adobe photoshop products have a learning curve -- but this product seems to be unwieldy and slow. It locked up my machine and took a long time to load.I returned it and will continue to use Elements 2 -- a great product. Not so for Elements vers 4. It needs more work.
4,Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0,"After learning this new software (I previously had 2.0), I really love it. I've been preparing a Memories Album (4 of them in fact) and it has been so helpful. Thumbs up! I didn't give it a 5 star simply because it wasn't as easy to negotiate as I would have liked....I purchased 2 4.0 books, The Missing Manual 4.0 (really helpful) and Teach Yourself Visually 4.0 (slightly helpful)...very good software after you learn your way around."
1,LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE.,"I have Photoshop album (elements 1), Elements 2, and Elements 3.So when Elements 4 came out, I got that too. Big mistake. Elements 4 is unwieldy, quirky and clumsy. It's very slow and unreliable.I had no trouble with the other versions so I never found out that Adobe's tech support is almost non-existant. But with Elements 4 I discovered that it's loaded with bugs and Adobe just doesn't care, unless you pay for each encounter.Then there is the business of upgrades. They have upgraded from version 1 to version 4 in slightly more than two years. That means if you want to keep the software up to date, you need to pay and pay and pay every six months or so for new versions. You don't get any discounts for upgrading.If you're looking for a photo editor, get the full photoshop if you can afford it or look elsewhere; there are many similar programs for sale."
1,Bad service,"The real product is not the product announced; I received and returned Adobe Photoshop 4.0, not Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0."
4,A must have,"This is the next step up for the more serious digital editor. I have been using this software for the last year and I still haven't used all the cool features. Slide shows are real nice, especially if you take pictures for a soccer, or any other team. Adding the music to the slideshow puts on the finishing touch."
1,SLOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!,Loaded on a HP ZD8000 with 1gb ram and XP PRO it ran 10-20 times slower than Elements 3.0. Had to uninstall (not easy as Adobe leaves LOTS of parts and pieces scattered all over your drive) and reinstall Elements 3.0. Something is clearly wrong with this product.
1,a downgrade instead of an upgrade,"Having used PSE in all its versions since the first, with PSE3 being a REAL step forward, this one is a REAL DOWNER!Not only are the few alleged ""improvements"" not up to what claimed when used,Adobe has ELIMINATED such valuable tools as the file browser. And this version is even SLOWER! How can they offer such an obvious step backwards? Forget it. Stick with PSE3 and wait for Adobe to make amends for its sins."
1,Strictly XP product,"I intended to upgrade from Photoshop Elements 2.0 to P.E. 3.0, and found that P.E. 3.0 had been superceeded by P.E. 4.0.Then I discovered that I just couldn't use P.E. 4.0 on my usal photo machine: PE 4.0 is XP only. Stricly XP, that is. Adobe doesn't support your Win2K anymore, whatever SP you have, period. Knowing that only about 30% of the Windows market was XP at last count, that looks to me like a dispising move to the rest of us. My dual CPU, 1 Go machine would be largely good enough to support PE 4.0, but Adobe decided not to let me do it. Reading from the other reviews, it looks like I souldn't have too much to regret, though. I'm going to look for an ""old"" (or used) PE 3.0 instead, and I'll stick there."
3,Absolutely Frustrating,"I have purchased every version of PhotoShop Elements 2.0, 3.0 and now 4.0., and have been pleased with each one, except for a strange and very annoying quirk with version 4.0. Installation is normal and the program works flawlessly for about a week, and then my validation disappears, and the program closes.In order to begin again, I have to uninstall the program and go through the installation program again. It makes no sense, and I cannot find any way to get through to Adobe. It's been a waste of time to upgrade.I am now using PaintShop Pro 9 with no problem.Just thought you would like to know."
1,Important Omission,"Elemets 4.0 has eliminated the very useful ""File Browser"" function from its ""Edit"" program. It forces the user to use its ""Organizer"" to gain access to folders containing collections of individual photo files. If the user doesn't like ""Organizer"", it becomes somewhat difficult access folders in the Edit program. In this respect 4.0 is a giant step backward from 3.0. The latter gave users the option of using ""File Browser"" in the Edit program to find and access files -- if the user doesn't wish to use the ""Browser"" program. For me this is reason enough to resist 4.0 and stick with 3.0."
2,Poor -- don't bother,"I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0. Performance is very poor, especially the organizer. It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements. Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable. The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly."
2,A big disappointment,"I recently purchases Elements 3.0 and I used it very often. I read the upgrade benefits in Elements 4.0 on the Adobe website and went for the upgrade. Very disappointing. Elemets 4.0 has eliminated the very useful ""File Browser"" function from its ""Edit"" program, giant step backward from 3.0. Also The slide show producer only allows one photo per page. Overall Elements 3.. it is faster and has better features If you already own PhotoShop Elements 2.0 or 3.0 don't bother with this upgrade."
1,Adobe Ripping Us Off????????,"I am so disapointed with version 4. I have 2 and 3 and I've been very happy that I have them. But this time I think Adobe wants to just make more money. The only new tool that seems to work is the skintone tool. I wanted it for the new extraction tool, but I found out it's no better than using the magic wand or lasso tool. It is also very sluggish compared to Elements 3! I won't pick on everything, It is just VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTING. BOOOOOOOOO TO ADOBE. SHAME ON YOU!"
2,Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 - Is it Better than its Predecessors?,"I have owned and used Adobe Photoshop Elements in its original issue, and Adobe Photoshop Album in its original issue, the two programs which are melded together for the current Elements 4.0.Is 4.0 better, and worth its price? Only marginally. The new version is considerably more complex, with little improvement in actual photo editing capabilities. About the only improvement is the linking of the two programs, Elements and Album, although that could be done manually with the earlier versions. Although I am running Windows XP Pro, with plenty of memory and storage, the 4.0 seems sluggish, and slow to respond.The photo editing aspect is, to me, not as satisfying as that with my original version of Elements. Compared to Google's Picasa, 2nd edition, however, Elements really is over-priced.Picasa is free, while Elements costs approximately $90!"
1,Keep Your 3.0 Version Of Elements,I was sorry I did not read all the reviews before I bought 4.0. Someone else wrote that they took out the File Browser feature in 4.0. It is true. One really useful feature and they took it out of 4.0. I am not sure the other minimal additions make up for having to use the extremely slow Photo Browser. It takes for ever for the Browser to load the photos. I tried to email Adobe to see if i could somehow load the file browser feature from 3.0 to 4.0 but I do not think you can even email adobe from their web site. How lame! The whole upgrade is lame for the price.
5,Best photo elements,I brought this for my daughter. She had used this version in school. She takes alot of pictures on her digital camera and now she can enhance them. she loves all the different effects. It is easy to install and use.
5,Really nice slide shows for TV,"I bought this version for the editing, and have used it for filing and creating slide shows for my TV. You have to have a DVD player that will recognize burned at home discs. Two of mine do, two don't. The ""how to"" manual is thick, and I haven't had time to learn very much yet. I think the programs only limits are my own."
1,Disappointing For A New Release,"I have had a chance to further review this product and wish to change my review. I see features in the Album that Picasa does not have. I really like the side by side photo comparison. I also like the way Adobe allows you to scroll around on a picture if zoomed in. It's zoom feature allows you to pan similar to a CAD package and being a CAD Guru, I like that alot. I would only like Adobe to add dual screen support. That would be extremely nice. Also, compared to Elements 3.0, this one is quite a bit slower. I would wait for this product to come down around the 30 dollar mark before a purchase."
4,Keeps getting better,I started with Elements 3 and thought it worked great. I have Elements 4 and can see it got better.
1,Are they joking,I have been using version 2.0 and loved it - downloaded a trail of 4.0 and was disappointed in the quality of the product. Who are they trying to fool - If I want to spend $100 on a new version I at least want it to be a superior product.
1,Do not upgrade!,I've been using Elements 2.0 and thought it was great. So I upgraded. MISTAKE!!! The new version is a nightmare to use. It's so clunkly compared to the old version. And SLOW! I wish I saved my money.
2,Beware AMD X2 owners,"I bought this program when I bought my new Nikon D50 so I could catalog the NEF files. It worked wonderfully on my 5 year old system but it was a little on the slow side. I decided to buy a new computer. An incredibly fast AMD X2 processor with 2 GB of RAM and a great nVidia 3d graphics card. I loaded PSE4 and it would crash on me. In the Adobe user forums an Adobe representative confirmed that the problem was the AMD X2 processor. Now I'm waiting for a patch or a new version to fix the errors. I REALLY like this program when it works correctly.I would not hesitate to recommend this program to anyone who wants to catalog and edit pictures but does not want to step up to Photoshop CS2. However, I would recommend downloading the demo first and using it extensivly for the month of trial you get."
2,Not For Beginners,I used to own Photoshop Album Deluxe and called to ask Adobe what replaced that. (That ran on windows 98 and now I have windows xp. They told me Photoshop Elements 4 replaced it.It is so much harder to use and the tutorials are not so good.
4,"Incredibly conprehensive, but little instruction.","Kit Summers' book is perhaps the most comprehensive juggling book out there. However, while it contains photos and brief explanations of tricks, it lacks detailed, step-by-step instruction. A beginner or accomplished juggler can read about what can be attained with practice, but how to get there, he must leave up to his own devices. I am a seven ball, five club juggler and use the book as a wonderful reference tool; however, for instuction and guidence, books such as Charles Dancey's Encylopedia of Ball Juggling, Dick Franco's Three Ball Digest or Martin Probert's Four Ball Juggling as essential."
3,Horgan is all over the place,"Just finished the book. Horgan writes like a journalist (and of course, he is one) and the book reads like a series of articles loosely bound by a weak central theme, if you can call it a theme. Like most of the other reviewers I recommend using RM's bibliography to do your own research. I kept waiting for Horgan to tie up the loose ends in this book. His conclusion: every path to enlightenment is flawed, but maybe enlightenment is not worth striving for anyway. Horgan's message is a real downer for the spiritual seeker. Just because he does not understand another's spirituality does not make it any less valid for the seeker."
1,What a waste,"Don't be fooled, this book is not rational, mystic, nor will it do anything to enlighten the reader. The title of this book is as decieving as it possibly could be and if you are interested in any of the things mentioned (science, spirituality, myscicism, rationailsm, or enlightenment) this is NOT the book for you."
1,A book to titillate skeptics who pretend to openmindedness,"In his first chapter Mr. Horgan writes, apparently sincerely, of ""the perilous waters of mysticism."" This is the first certain indication that the author literally does not know what he is talking about. If you are about to read this book in the belief that you will learn something about mysticism, be advised that you are mistaken."
2,A relative disappointment,"My impetus for reading this book largely came largely from my fondness for the author's superior The End of Science. The title of this book is a bit odd, since it doesn't make any particular case for the rationality of mysticism. The book is an easy read, but some of the gurus it discusses are not even interesting in their oddness. The author seems as fascinated by psychedelics as he does by spirituality, and the reader will likely come away having learned as much about the former as the latter."
5,wonderful picture book and supports a good cause!,"The tale of Fatty Coon is a cute, funny, picture eBook that is sure to delight your little ones.The images are beautiful.The story is simple enough, that after a few reads, your child should be able to tell you the story. My children are in college, but as toddlers they would have loved this book.The tale of Fatty Coon is available on Kindle. I reviewed this on my pc, and the images were crisp and clear. If you do not own a kindle, you can download the kindle app to your phone, personal computer, tablet and iPod. Treat your little one's to a fantastic picture book and help out a good cause."
2,Don't use for applique,"The one good thing about this shirt is that it is very soft. It is also very small - I recommend ordering a size up. It is thin which is nice for hot summer however, it does not hold it's shape well. I bought for applique and after washing, the shirt is twisted so the applique is not centered. Even if I washed it prior to applique, I would have measured to center the applique on the shirt but the shirt doesn't hang straight. I won't buy any more of this brand for this use."
1,Slow and Badly Packaged,"After not receiving the HP Fuser kit I ordered in a timely manner, I contacted the supplier to inquire. Their response was generic and failed to consider the information per my inquiry, including my now-immediate need for the part or that I would have to make other arrangements. Due to their lack of adequate response, I was forced to ask them to cancel my order. They refused and told me that I would have to return the item (which had not even shipped yet) if I did not want it. I eventually got the part I no longer needed more than three weeks after my original order date. The part I received was in a box that looked like it had been through a war; it was obviously very used and it even had a part cut out of box. It was simply unbelievable. The only effort they made toward me was to plead to not give them a bad review on Amazon. I would NEVER order anything from these folks again. If you are reading this, then you have been warned."
5,Incredible machine!,"This machine lasted 10 years. It is rare to find garbage disposers which last this long. It has also been trouble free; I had only one jam during a holiday dinner clean-up, but no other problems. Now that the capacitor has finally died, my new disposal will be an InSinkErator 444."
1,Defective design,"Mine started leaking after five years. That might sound ok, but we give it pretty light use, and a disposer should last at least ten. A little online research shows that this is a common problem and is due to a design defect. The casing rusts through and can't be fixed. ISE has known about this problem for years, and in fact came out with a modified design in 2005 that tried to address this problem.ISE refused to do a thing for me. My next disposer will be from a different company, one that cares about its customers."
1,The insinkerator 444 is a poor choice,I have owned and used two insinkerator 444 disposal units. The first onefailed after 2 years due to a bearing failure. Insinkerator replaced theentire unit free of charge. (Husband performed the labor) The second unitlasted about 2.5 years and it seems like the same problem is occurring(noisy operation and locking up). I do not abuse the disposer and havedecided to purchase from a different manufacturer (waste King) this timeand hope that insinkerator will learn to make a better product.
1,It Leaks After A Few Years! - NOT Recommended!,"Read the reviews posted here (and elsewhere), this unit will develope a leak in the casing that can not be fixed after 4 or 5 years. I will not be replacing mine with a InSinkErator model!Not recommended!"
4,Disposal,"I had one of these before and replaced it with the same unit, as I think that that makes it easier for the plunbing connections."
1,ISE is Crap.,"InSinkErator, designed to fail--just after the warranty expires--feh. Well, they've lost another customer. I used to be a fan of ISE but no longer. Went to replace my failed 444 (motor just hums) and can't believe they're charging double what the old 444 cost. Insult to injury, they're all made in China now. So, my question to their mgt. team is where's all the savings passed along to your American customers after outsourcing to China? Yea, that's what I thought. Sorry ISE, I'm through being screwed by companies like you schlubbing crap on American consumers at premium prices. Spoke with the wife and we'll just do without a disposer--its not a necessity."
1,Just awful!,This product was terrible to use. I was trying to laminate some bookmarks and they just curled up and were unable to be straighted ever again. Nasty stuff!
2,Always curved and extremely weak glue,"For starters, all of Xyron's products come on two rolls that bind together when fed through the machine so when you feed it, your finished product is and will always be slightly curved. I used this machine with the double laminate, the sticker, and the magnet rolls and all of them have this result. The double laminate does a terrible job at sealing around even the flattest of paper and if you cut anywhere close to the edge-it WILL come apart so expect a few centimeters of dead space around your final project. It absolutely does not work if you use any types of layers- it will bubble and warp and not have a smooth lamination. I used this product for my homeschooling daily charts so they could be reused and easily wiped off. It is very thin plastic which stained easily even with a dry erase marker. I do not recommend using this product."
5,Hard to find -- except on Amazon,"I have an older Xyron, and my kids like to use the laminating feature. I was unable to find the right cartridge at Michaels, and found exactly what I was looking for on Amazon. At a great price, too."
5,Makes you wish you were Latin!,"The woman is amazing... her vocals, her orchestra. Delivers merengue the way it's meant to be heard!"
2,you lied to me,"I bought to you this movie because this version says that it is with the language in Spanish, but it is not true, you lied to me, apart from me to have paid more expensive of as it is the price that it has in this moment."
2,"Nice pictures, but...","There seems to be little content here. Some nice images, but I didn't learn any how-to from the techniques. This is another guide to lucky dice-rolls with infrared."
2,a little disappointing,I was a little disappointed in both the images and text. The author/photographer could have done more with the landscapes he had to work with.
4,I love this makeup.,"this is the best makeup I have ever used. It gives a lovely matte finish, and you don't need to use a lot. doesn't promote breakouts, and is also a sunscreen. It's great."
1,Sorme Mineral Illusion,"Very bad makeup. It is oily, thick and the vanilla beige is actually yellow. They would not allow me to return the product so I actually had to throw it away. No way I am putting that on my face."
3,Entertaining but I can see why it was cancelled...,"I am only through disc 1 in watching these, and I never saw the show while it was on the air. I am a fan of the original Ellen series, and of Ellen's talk show, so I thought it would be logical to get this as well. The story is fun and as always Ellen is very funny. I watched most of disc one in a straight (hehe) shot and after a couple of episodes I found myself a little bored but nevertheless I am going to finish watching the series."
5,Absolute Yummiest! so...Where's my CD!?!?!,"Listened to this many times years back on vinyl, gave up in divorce years back. Just bought sealed vinyl cutout because I can't find the CD....& I don't even HAVE a turntable at this point, just didn't want to lose this totally yummy album! Anyone got a link to John, rattle his cage to get this one out again, it's one of the top 10 I'd keep in a fire!"
4,adequate,"Very cute looking, but bristles are a little cheap. But, hey, they are for young children so do the job."
3,Decent but not great brushes,"They're ok, but a little like straw and not as easy to use as some of the synthetic ones we've used. Seem fairly durable."
1,junk...,"the brushes smelled toxic, and the varnish they applied to the handle obviously spilled onto the bristles making them hard...I would NOT recomend, especially for a child!I bought some quailty brushes (by crayola) even though they were a few dollars more..."
1,Half the brushes arrived with some sort of lacquer dried on them,"When I pulled these out of the package, the bristles of the flat brushes were as hard as a rock like they'd been used in some sort of clear lacquer and left to dry without being rinsed out. I was able to rinse out most of it but am a little uneasy about whatever that was since the brushes were made in china.. Would purchase a different set instead."
3,Sent as a gift,"Sent as a gift to my neice and nephew. I think they are enjoying them, well my neice will when she gets old enough!"
5,Wonderful resource,"This is an excellent book to look at whenever you're trying to study the pyramids. The illustrations are so wonderful, that it definitely projects a clear view on daily work on a pyramid. I recomend it for adults as well..., we're never too old to aloud a good illustrated book to stimulate our imagination when studying the ancient pyramid builders."
2,Diabolical sound quality ruins this,"Admittedly where I am this is cheap ( 9 - and even then I got in on discount ) and what I got was not pretty. The tape that Mark E. Smith has of this seems to nearly give up the ghost. There are some nice moments on this though. Enough to inquire investigation over some of their other material ( admittedly I'm new to the game ) but you have to bear with the terrible sound quality. However given that this is MES we're talking about, the front cover says all - if you don't like it, this is what I think of ya anywayStill only one for possible diehards but the price Amazon here is a little off-putting nonetheless"
5,Love her Puerto Rico concert!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jennifer LOPEZ Does a good job in this Puerto Rico live concert!Jennfer has always been a good entertainer, she is a great actress and limited vocals on singing and a good dancer, she puts all that into the concert and easy to love her while she does the show.LOVED HER SELENA TRIBUTE, she did a great job with her song.I DO wish she released another dvd of live performances, from ellen degenerous show,vmas, etc..I MISS THAT!This is a great DVD TO GET."
5,"The Best I've seen, bar none!!","J-Lo live in Puerto Rico...WOW what a show!! Let there be no doubt, no one in today's music can move an audience like Jennifer Lopez, bar none!! This is a DVD that will be watched over and over. Once it start's you can not stop watching."
3,Bought as a gift,I bought this video for a four year old little girl. Her aunt had passed away and before that she would go to her aunts house and sing and dance while watching this. The video her aunty had was a library video so i ordered it from Amazon. Shipped fast
5,this dvd is the best !,hey people i really reocomend this dvd concert 100% im a j.lo fan but is really good and she is really hot in there.
2,Another J.Lo product...haven't we had enought?,"I would rate this dvd as just ""o.k."" Nothing spectacular, nothing blew me away. Heck, No Doubt packed more punch in their two-song performance on their SuperBowl performance a few weeks ago.Note to J.Lo: stick to movies. You have no stage presence and your ""In Living Color"" fly-girl moves are getting old. Try something that suits your age...umm, I don't know...maybe class and dignity. Surround yourself with real talent (you're good at that...see Ja-rule, LL Cool J, Ben Affleck), in order to deflect your weak vocal chords.;"
1,boring,"This concert could have been so much better, and and the slow motion parts every 10 seconds made me sick. The concert was boring too, don't waste your money on this trash."
2,Below Average,Relative to other concert videos this one is below average and not a keeper. Perhaps a good one-off rental.
4,Blood Chet and Tears,"This is an excellent CD (especially at this price). I regard it highly as I have found it impossible to get hold of Blood Chet and Tears by Chet Baker and this CD has three tracks off that album - Evil Ways, Spinning Wheel and the brilliant 'Vehicle'. Other stand out tracks include 'California Dreaming' by Wes Montgomery and Everydays by Kenny Burrell. Highly recommended....."
2,I received a used copy.,"Nowhere in the description does it mention that the book is used. It arrived in pretty good shape, but the cover had a crease and it was clearly marked on the inside cover that the book belonged to ""Siobhan."" As I had purchased this as a gift for my niece, I was not happy to have been misled."
5,a glimpse of my childhood,"This book brought back fond memories of my childhood, growing up as a young boy in the South Bronx. Me and the rest of the gang used to let our creativity run wild - while boys in other neighborhoods were into professional wrestling and BB guns, we used to go antiquing in SOHO and sell baked goods at our little roadside stand.Anyhoo, gotta run - these muffins won't bake themselves! :)Ciao for now,Petey"
2,Nikita: Khrushchev Remembers,"This book was an inheritance from an uncle and I reluctantly read lightly thru it. As a Cuban American my greatest interest was chapter 20 on Fidel Castro and the Caribbean Crisis. From Khrushchev writings it is obvious that he is a devout communist and this strong bias obviously comes thru in his writings (e.g. when describing initial contacts with Cuba thru Raul and Che and when poorly apologizing for anti-Castro dissent), however there are a few moments of interesting and candid honesty throughout the book, such as his assessment acknowledging that Stalin's collectivization efforts halving the agricultural production of the Soviet Union and when recollecting that the idea to install missiles in Cuba was his, not Castro's. For those hungry to get to know about Khrushchev's life, surviving Stalin's rule, World War II and his side of the story during the Cold War, this is your book."
3,Nature Walks in Southern New Hampshire,"As a Trail guide I think it definately needs more description of the trail and put trail names on the maps. It's nice to go by a map once you are on a trail, but these maps leave out a lot of important trail markers and was very hard to follow. Usually on any given trail there are a lot of loops you can take, nothing was specified on these maps. The description on what is on the trail is pretty nice, but using the maps turned out effortless. You need to concentrate more on the trail so people don't get lost."
2,Coast Flashlight,"I have had this flashlight for about 4 years, and have used it gently. It is very bright, and the bulbs and batteries last much longer than in a standard flashlight. However, the black rubber button that turns the flashlight on and off was starting to disconnect from the moment I purchased this flashlight, and now it has completely fallen off. Considering that Coast is supposed to be known for quality, I am disappointed."
4,"Great product, but only if you have a 100 mbs network","This is a great product, for any type of network storage. I liked it, but when I tried it on 10 mbs it dragged! Don't waste your money if you don't have a 100 mbs network. Besides that it's a nice drive. 8GB good for mp3's or whatever else you want to be able to publicly acess. All in all, a good hard drive for those of you with 100 mbs networks."
2,pain to use with newer computers,"I thought I could just copy the existing hard drive onto a 250GB drive and use it that way, turns out, this is not compatible with anything newer then windows 98. I ended up having to format the drive and install NASlite on it. now it works great, but it's not something your average user would do."
5,Great Invention!,Love i! Excellent price. Better than I expected! You can hang multiple items and some. I would recommend it to everyone looking to save space!
5,Rack,No more slipping ties on the bottom of my wardrobe. Great idea.perfect for my belts . Could be larger though.
4,works well,"the belts stayed on well have to even place belts so that it balances well, have also used for ties too works well for them too."
4,Sturdy & Stylish,"Great price on a well built attractive item. Does exactly what it is intended to do, and it does it well.Could have been designed a little better with more hooks to hold ties as it only holds 8, but you can put a few ties on each hook if you need to."
5,Husband loves it,My husband liked this so much he asked me to buy him another one. It's perfect if you are looking for a solution for all your belts
2,Not a great product!,"I was not satisfied with this product. The picture made it seem the product was much bigger than it truly is--it is not big at all. The belts also did not stay on the hooks. Don't even think about using wide belts on the rack--they do not even stay put for a minute. I thought using smaller belts would be better, but they were still falling off the rack. I was very disappointed with my purchase. I really do not understand its purpose if the belts do no stay put. The manufacturer needs to go back to the drawing board on this."
5,Good Rack,This is a really nice chrome rack. I like how it is made to hang in my closet. I use it to hold my belts. It can hold a lot of weight.
5,great organizer,"Some reviews had me worried but i am completely satisfied with this purchase. The belts fit properly and once weighted evenly, the rack itself is very stable and does not tip over. I highly recommend."
4,Nifty belt and tie organizer,"This is a great little belt and tie organizer. The belt hooks are little too close together and so some of my larger buckles are overlapping each other, so that is a little annoying. Other than that it's a great product and I am satisfied with it."
2,Being at home with Claude,"I have ordered this film and it was written French original version with english subtitles on the description and on the case. It was ok for me but I had a surprise when I put the fil in the VSH. The film was ""doublé"" in english. No french version at all! Being at home with Claude is now in my garbage bin."
3,This is one of Roy Dupuis' top performances.,"I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this film because of the subject matter, but since I am a fan of Roy Dupuis decided to try it anyway. I am glad I did because he gives one of his best performances. I was completely wrapped up in the story. The reasonI only gave it 3 stars was because it sort of slowed down in the middle, but by the end I was very moved by his character Yves. It is a great ""study"" and I am glad I have added it to my collection."
2,Poor Performer,"Though fairly easy for a diy installer, this disposal won't grind lemons, chicken bones, or many other food items. Don't think this model is made any more, so this poor performance may not apply to newer units. Going to buy a Waste King L-8000 to replace it."
2,"Great Pieces, Poor Orchestration","I'm a huge fan of Shostakovich, and the Violin Sonata and Viola Sonata are two great works. However, I wasn't impressed by the orchestration of these pieces on this CD. Only a string orchestra and some percussion are used, which, rather than give the pieces a fuller sound, make them sound thin. There were moments that begged for some woodwinds or brass to jump in, and without them the pieces lacked the amount of emotional impact that they could have had. Furthermore, the lack of contrast in timbre between the virtuoso and the string orchestra sometimes made the pieces feel dull. I'm hoping that someone out there will take these great pieces and orchestrate them for a full orchestra."
5,new looks...better than ever!,"I have everything that BJ has recorded(as far as I know) and this CD just like all the others is incredible! I was so excited to see some new material for BJ. He does a fantastic job on the remakes (with his own unique style of course)of the songs on this CD. (Make the world go away, My Elusive Dreams, Don't worry....They all blew me away!!! Worth every penny and then some!"
5,"the ""true"" Luis Miguel","I will always insist that Luis Miguel's talent is first and foremost as a performer. This album proves this. Although I have yet to buy ""Vivo"", this album features some of LM's finest singing that I have yet to hear. I don't know if it is because LM's range and depth as a singer has grown so much since he recorded the studio versions of many of these songs, or if it is because he simply sings better live. Of particular note, the medley on disc one is incredible. Also, the mariachi tracks on CD two we hear a side of LM fans rarely hear. The mariachi tracks alone make this record a keeper. This is obviously a must for fans of LM, but it is also an excellent first LM record to own."
5,The first Live album,"This is the first live album of Luis Miguel, has almost all his songs from the record Luis Miguel Busca una Mujer till Segundo Romamnce, the music and the sound are perfect, and his performance is incredible."
3,Powerful Stories,"Very powerful short stories about the interplay and tension for Native Americans between traditional life and life in the city. My favorite stories were ""Angry Fish"" and ""Museum Indians""."
2,Gray Brander's ROT...,Kyle Brubaker takes time out from his California life of surfing to help a sick uncle take care of the family farm in a small Wisconsin town. He quickly falls for a local girl and takes her to the town Carnival where they're brutally attacked by a trio of hoodlum brothers. Throw in a helpful gypsy and you've got yourself a story. At least that's what Brander thought when he laid this tale to paper. This is the type of work you would expect from a college student. Not a veteran writer whose book THE HOWLING was made into a decent movie. ROT is too short and quick. If your looking for a similiar story that's well done try Stephen King's THINNER.
1,A Reference Manual,"And perhaps a good reference manual at that. But this is not ""A Beginner's Guide"" as the subtitle states. The author ""describes"" the properties, data types, functions, syntax, etc., of SQL Server 2005, but does not implement the step by step building of a sample database along the way, as one would expect of a beginner's book. It's like trying to learn this high powered program by reading help files; not very helpful if one is not first presented with relevant questions in a practical application. I would recommend this book to anyone with a photographic memory."
3,The Novice,"This book was a little too advanced for me. I need a true beginners, very, very basic book. I have decided to go back to school, for the training I need.This book would be perfect for someone who has some knowledge of SQL. I will keep the book, as a reference book in the future. For a book that was listed as ""Used"", I was surprised, it was in perfect shape and could have been sold as ""New"". A nice purchase for 89 cents. Amazon is great for purchasing books, bedding, printed music, even home decor items."
4,Great,Great for younger children. I bought this for an autistic child and he loved it. It would be better if it came in hard cover though.
3,the girl changes skin,years passed by but the girl is still on top. Great changes but good changes as she said grunge helped her to change skin
5,"Una descarga latina, caballero!","All of us know the enormous relevance of Carl Tjader in what Latin Jazz concerns. This circumstance earned him the admiration, stem and affection of millions of aficionados worldwide.Dave Samuels is a undeniable virtuoso who gave Spyro Gyra that preferential status ; currently he plays too with Andy Narell, that eminence of the vibraphone.Eddie Palmieri, one of the last living legends; five time Grammy winner composed Tjaderized. But if you consider the superb musical support with artists of the stature of Dave Valentin. Joe Santiago, Alain Mallet, Ray Barreto in congas (Triste), Marc Quiñones (percussion), ""El Negro"" Hernández in drums, Michael Wolff and John Benitez, you must agree we have a ""Big Leaguers Team"", that hardly will be far to disappoint you.There is no minor track. This is a well deserved homage to a notable figure of Latin Jazz, his majesty Carl Tjader.Buy it without dilation. The album is a jam session."
4,"Good, but not as good as ""The Pope of Greenwich Village""","I read and really enjoyed ""TPoGV"", so I bought this book. It is not nearly as well crafted, and drags in a few places. Still, I enjoyed the book."
3,It's okay,"My baby is 10 months old. We got him this toy for Christmas. At that time, I figured it was maybe too heavy or he was just too little because he wasn't really interested in it. Now that he's gotten bigger and stronger, and more interested in toys, he plays with it if it's given to him. He doesn't go for the toy without it being given to him though.He hasn't figured out how to change the shape of it or twist it, but he likes to put it in his mouth and shake it. It might be more popular with him as he gets older. For now it's just okay."
3,a lot sillier than you might think,"This book features a madcap adventure of stolen human eggs, with multiple gangsters, actors, deranged fans, a philosophical priest, and CIA agents across the globe. The adventure is funny, but the romance between the spoiled actress and the police officer is too difficult to believe."
4,trunk organizer,This organizer is exactly what I was looking for! It has a lot of compartments and fits many things inside. It seems to stay stationary in my trunk area of my trunk/ I am happy with this purchase.
5,holds a lot,"the bag was larger than I expected but I do like it. It holds a lot of items and has several pockets on the outsides. Great to help grocery bags, maps, etc."
2,Not exactly as it appears...,"This container has numerous pockets and has the potential to be very useful. However, the bag is unstructured and simply flops over or onto itself. The walls of the bag are flimsy and actually make the bag feel cheap. The picture shows the bag standing upright and firm, but that is definitely not the case. I was expecting more and I think the picture is deceiving."
2,Too Soft,"This soft sided organizer is too soft...you have to pack it with stuff in order for the sides to, well, actually BE sides. It's kind of like one of those plastic swimming pools for kids where the sides only stay up if it's filled with water. I bought this to place groceries and other misc. items in to prevent them from rolling around in the back of my explorer. The cardboard box I was using before is/was much better. I do not recommend this item unless you plan to pack it with items as shown in the picture."
5,Organized... FINALLY!,"The back of the family's Honda CRV had become a disorganized scatterbox of CDs, umbrellas, tape cassettes, and other sundries.I wanted something with exterior and interior pockets that was sturdy enough for the job, but also portable for when we get a new car. I considered purchasing a product made by Honda, but figured that it might not fit inside the next vehicle.This organizer is perfect. Highly recommended!"
3,Meh. It holds stuff.,"The title kind of says it all. It holds stuff. It seems determined to not want to keep its shape. I am debating installing a wire along the bottom so it will keep its shape when not full, perhaps with coat hangers."
5,Works well. Good size.,"I found myself having to keep some loose items in my trunk on a regular basis and was tired of it always being a mess. This unfolded well and organizes my shopping bags, toddler necessities and the occassional random object that will inevitable roll around the trunk while I drive. I'd buy this one again."
3,Not exactly what I needed,Needed something a little more ridgid and taller. Will work for smaller items and other loose stuff in the trunk.
5,A Perfect Fit,"A Perfect fit for my new Honda Fit! I already had two smaller organizers for the trunk of my old car. When I purchased a hatchback, I wanted to make sure everything was totally organized in the cargo area. This organizer is worth the extra money I paid. I can take it into the grocery store and use its many compartments to add my groceries to and take it out in the cart and from the cart to the cargo area with ease. Then from the cargo area to the kitchen with ease. Very sturdy, yet lightweight organizer. Then it completely folds compactly before going back into the cargo area (if you like). Highly Recommend it over the others I own."
3,It works,"It works fine and the build quality is fine. Like others have stated this is entirely soft fabric so it will not stand up by itself and it is not easy to move in and out of the car with stuff in it. If you are planning on leaving it in the car all the time it is fine, if you are planning on using to move items around or remove it from the car often then you should look for something else."
4,Great for long trips and groceries.,"I bought this before a long road trip and put it in between my children's car seats. One side for my 2 year old and the other my 4 year old. I filled it with books and toys to keep them busy. In the outer pockets I put snacks for them that I could reach during the trip. It kept things handy and organized. Also is great for minivans to put groceries in since the back. I wish it were a bit more stable, though. It is collapsible, which is why it is not as stable."
2,not quite what I wanted,We have had organizers for the back of our Pickup and needed new ones. These looked like the same ones so we purchased them as replacements. Sadly they are not the same. The previous ones had hard inserts that made the compartments stand up without any help. They were very easy to use. These have no such inserts and the whole thing flops around and collapses. You need to hold it open with one hand while trying to get the grocery bags into the compartments. VERY inconvenient and ackward.
3,Just Ok,"So, maybe I should have gotten a hard sided one. It's handy, but collapses immediately. So, in the back of the car you need both hands to get it to stand up and then where does the 3rd hand come from to put the bag in it????"
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED......,"I have an organizer for my trunk and bought this one to give me more space options to put my stuff when grocery shopping. This organizer is so ""soft sided"" that it's a pain in the neck trying to place stuff in it. If you load it fully then I guess it works ""okay""....but just ""okay"". When you take anything out the sides collapse and the remainder of items in the organizer.....are no longer organized!! It is so ""soft sided"" and made of such flimsy material that you cannot carry anything with a little weight to it into the house using the organizer. Not a fan of this one....my other organizer is 100 times better!!"
4,Great trunk organizer!,"We keep all of our miscellaneous car accessories in here as well as some emergency items. Tons of pockets around the outside make it easy to grab what you need. We keep sunscreen, bug spray, and paper towels in some of the outer pockets. I wish that the 4 outer panels were a little more stiff as the organizer kind of collapses in on itself without much in it, but it's still a great bin. The handles on the ends make it easy to pick up to take it out of the car. I noticed that some people use this to load and unload groceries. I'm not sure that would work too well as there is no stiff support in the bottom of the organizer. Unless you have really light groceries, I think the center of the bin would sag and you'd end up with a mess. As a trunk organizer, it's a winner."
3,It does what it says it does,"Nice little organizer for my car for the price. I gave it three stars because I had hoped the sides were stiff, but they're just the canvas material, so if you don't have anything inside to hold them up, they kind of collapse inward. But hey, it keeps all the crap in my trunk in one place so it's not rolling around all over the place and there is room to carry my groceries, and if I need to empty my trunk to carry other things, the whole thing just lifts out."
3,It's okay,"I was excited to order this item based on the reviews but once it arrived, i find it just okay. Its useful only if you buy lots of groceries and use this for saving few cents by not buying paper bags."
3,Good but dividers are needed,"This needs to be full to be structurally sound. I should have realized that. However, it is still useful to stow away items that would normally be rolling around my trunk."
4,Nice Storage unit,"I bought this to store gear like: tow straps, chains, trailer hitch/balls, tools, etc.It fits well under the rear seat of my '03 2500HD Extended Cab.Only downside I see is Zippers are poor quality"
5,Works as intended,"Velcro helps it stay put. Items stay in containers. I looked at more expensive options, but this got good reviews, so I bought this. The reviews were accurate, and I'm happy."
3,"It's OK...not the end-all, be-all","Got a new car and wanted to keep the trunk organized. This is soft sided and floppy unless filled. Also note the pockets are big but most are solid fabric so once stuff is stored, you don't see it (not a good thing...would prefer mesh/see through all around.It's not big enough to put a bunch of filled grocery bags, but it's a great place to store the empty bags, as well as other nice to have items.I wouldn't buy again, but don't dislike enough to return it."
3,another for collectors,"this new job from cidade negra its a recopilation of hits in live versions with a new track and 3 bonus tracks from studio......i went to see that show in miami but was a great disapoinment.....not much to say about it,just another cd in their career"
4,It's all Ara!,"The harmony of life is music that enables humankind to lay down their weapons and pick up their instruments. Four creative musicians have gathered their wordily knowledge and persona to this pleasant album that mixes jazz and strong culture music under the name of NIGHT ARK.But this album belongs to Ara Dinkjian who wrote most of the compositions and whose oud, cumbus & sazbus feature heavily with the assistance of a great bunch of musicians you would love to spend the evening with."
4,"Great soap, why so much more than the others?","I stumbled upon this at some point and purchased it. For the price I guess I assumed it was a three pack? Eitherway, I won't hold that against it! The soap is great, but it isn't any better than the Yardley you can get at most retail places for about a dollar a bar."
1,TERRIBLE!,Nice concept and GREAT crackling sound to enjoy! However this disc will display different resolutions depending on which dvd model and make you have. The other discs from this company I have purchased are awesome but this DVD in my opnion just has poor quality video . I would NOT reccommend this one. One positive note is the company did respond quickly to my email complaint with 24 hours.
1,Never Again!,I first received a damaged disc -- then received a replacement which is just as bad (in fact worse)! Never had a problem with any other blu-ray discs from anyone. Never again am I ordering a product from this manufacturer!!
3,"Awesome guitar, crappy vocals","I agree with the 5-star reviews except for the vocals. This CD would be perfect if it weren't for the weird-sounding voice. It's also bad in other Annihilator albums too. I am sure this is the main reason Annihilator isn't as popular as we all wanted it to be. Just listen to the samples above and check for yourself. And the lyrics suck too, with repetitive annoying rhymes. But, hey, the guitar is awesome, the speed is as fast as it should be, with original rythms. All songs kick ass, specially ""Schizos"" and ""Loving the Sinner""."
4,Annihilator - 'Criteria For A Black Widow' (CMC International),"Haven't heard this CD in ages, as this looks to be the Canadian thrash metal band's eighth album - ? I was never aware they had so many CD's out. 'Criteria For A Black Widow' reportedly reunites most of the original line-up (always a good thing). Tunes I remember hearing (and liking) when this CD first came out were ""Bloodbath"", ""Nothing Left"", the heavy-duty ""Loving Sinner"" and ""Sonic Homicide"". Line-up: Randy Rampage-vocals, Jeff Waters-guitar & vocals, Dave Scott Davis-guitar, Russel Bergquist-bass and Ray Hartman-drums. Should do a lot for fans of Helloween, Pantera, Sacred Reich, Children Of Bodom and possibly Celtic Frost."
5,From Meringue to Magnificent !!!,"Nuevos Senderos was Olga Tanon's breather from her regular ""Queen of the Meringue"" status. The songs were artistically written and well produced by Marco Antonio Solis from Los Bukis fame. For fans who are expecting a fast-paced meringue workout, this album is not it. Instead, you get well-crafted and very beautiful, romantic boleros, ballads, and maybe a few cumbias. From start to finish of entire c.d., vocals and instrumentation are magnificent ! You can feel the passion and emotion that Olga put into this project along with Solis; She can really belt out with her voice on these ballads ! This c.d. is highly recommended. Do not dismiss it simply because you might think it's too slow- paced--there are plenty of surprises that may change the way you think about Latin boleros, cumbias and ballads with this one!!!..."
3,Not for Newer Fans,"Olga Tanon's ""Nuevos Senderos"" is a great CD for old Olga fans, seeing the way they react to it. But I am a newer Olga fan, and ""Nuevos"" really didn't get me that excited. I have four Olga CDs, most of them upbeat, and this CD kinda turned me off. The only songs that I almost always repeat are ""Cuestion de Suerte"", ""En Ti"", and sometimes ""Basta Ya!"". I like the live version of ""Me Subes, Me Bajas, Me Subes"" much better than this version, it seems slower. All in all, a good CD, but better get more experienced with Olga Tanon before delving into her more experimental works. :-)"
5,Best One,"It is the one which, I have been looking for, I am completely satisfied. I will buy this item in future too."
2,Contractor's cheap coice,"We got this new with the house when it was built. We use it daily. It started leaking badly after 4.5 years, then died shortly after. In short it lasted a few weeks under 5 years."
1,Case cracked,After 3 years of very light usage (I compost most things) the case cracked spilling water into my cabinet. I just amazed me that something like that would happen. I really made me feel like this is was a complete piece of junk.
5,"Good product, fast shipping!","Product as promised, shipped on time and was easy to install. Works fine in the last month of operation. The Badger disposer which came with my new home lasted about 7 years and then rusted through to leak. Hope this one has a longer life."
1,"""Garbage"" disposer","The new house I bought in December '11 has one of these. It hasn't cracked or leaked (yet), but I certainly don't recommend it. It doesn't grind worth of crap. The cheap model GE disposer that came with my last house (brand new) gave nearly 6 years of pretty good service, and it would grind just about anything pretty well. Don't get this Badger 1. I was just looking on here for a replacement and figured I see what other folks said about 'em. It figures....."
5,In Sinkerater,"Product was delivered on time. It was easy to install after i reviewed the instructional Lowe's Video on You Tube. I also went to Home Depot with the product and they helped me connect the Electric cord which was not included in the kit. I could have re-used the old electric cord but I opted to buy a new cord kit for 12 dollars. Overall, I saved quite a bit of money by using Amazon and doing it myself. It was a my first successful major appliance installation. I love the internet!!"
3,Value for the money,"This disposer was installed by my builder about ten years ago. it had light to moderate use (vacation home). It finally kicked the bucket just in time for Christmas. I did all the troubleshooting steps just to find out that the inner parts had rusted into dust and that was why the machine no longer worked. I had never heard of such a thing, and when I contacted the company, found out there was only a one year warranty and somehow I was ahead of the game. The company handled it well, they were professional and prompt. I did make sure that the next disposer I bought had a longer warranty and more horsepower."
2,Disposable Disposals,"When we bought our house, the garbage disposal was a cheap Insinkerator contractor model 333. It lasted 4 years. I replaced it with an expensive 3/4 hp model Insinkerator. It lasted 2 months past the 5 year warranty. So, if I've established that Insinkerator is junk, why did I buy another Insinkerator (InSinkErator Badger 1, 1/3 HP Household Food Waste Disposer) to replace it? 1) It is a quick and easy replacement. The quick change mounting system is the best feature of insinkerator. Obviously the manufacturer knows something about the durability of their products. 2) We are selling the house within a year."
1,Badly designed - Leaks through reset button after very light use,"I bought this unit in HD and installed it myself. I've had this unit for around 5 years. After the GE that the builder installed failed in 7 yrs i expected this unit to last longer. But NO.. it leaked through the reset button in the bottom of the unit and ruined my cabinet with black mold. Even worse the unit had only very light use not more that 15 secs a day disposing soft food like rice and veggies. Do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this, this unit has design flaws.I called Badger service for whatever it is worth.. and they gave me the out of warranty story and gave me a discount for a new one ($50 + tax and free shipping). Not a good deal, as i find that Amazon has it for $64.96 i am going to look for another brand."
1,leaked and stopped working after 7 years,ISE Badger.1 1/3 HP started leaking from bottom making mess under sink. Motor stopped working a couple of weeks later.
3,After-sales service and support was good,"InSinkErator offered better service and support after the sale than most other companies, and assisted me in replacing a faulty part."
1,Would not Buy Again,Unit started leaking through the case after a few years. Poorly designed and made. Probably designed to fail.Replaced with a Waste King and it looks to be better made(less expensive also...it was the same price for a 1/2 hp).
4,17 good years!,"builder installed when we had our home built in 1994, I think I killed it last night (though maybe not). Anyway, I'm going to replace and plan to buy another of the same model. Never had a problem with this one, so why go with anythingdifferent?InSinkErator Badger 1, 1/3 HP Household Food Waste Disposer"
1,"4 years, Leaking, Rusting, Jamming, Junk","I will not buy this brand again. Looks like there are MUCH better, longer-lasting options out there for a little more money. Looking to replace with this:Waste King L-8000 Legend Series 1 HP Continuous Feed Operation Waste Disposer."
1,"Leaks, rusty junk.","I bought a new house in 12/04, the badger-1 came with the house. Worked fine for five years, I live alone and eat out most of the time so I rarely used it. However, I made guacamole one night as I had done several times before and put the peels in the disposal. The next morning I noticed a strange sound when running the disposal, so I looked inside the rubber seal and saw that the peels were gone but the interior was rusted. I then looked under the sink and was horrified to find that it had been leaking for who knows how long, with black mold everywhere. I will never buy another insinkerator product.After looking at reviews on Amazon, the Waste King Legend 8000 seems to be the way to go, with a lifetime in-home service warranty, averaging 4.7 out of 5 stars, and only fifty-two dollars more than the incredibly poor-performing badger."
1,Flawed product,I have bought Two of these units in ten years. Cracks in the upper housing seems to be a common problem.
1,Garbage Literally. Worthless.,Had mine for a short time it hardly gets used and it started leaking out of the reset button. Avoid this product or come over to my house and throw 70.00 in my new non-badger disposal.
4,Was exactly as stated,overall a basic version and does what is required. Was easy to install and simple instructions were included. Worth the cost.
1,leaks after 4 years of gentle use,"I thought the leaking was caused by worn out seals. No, it's caused by rusted out metal. The bottom of the end bell assembly, which seperates the motor from the shredder, is completely rusted. There is one hole already. I can poke through the iorn sheet at several other places. In other words, the disposal can at most last about 4 years under light use."
1,Short Term Fix for a Larger Problem,I bought this thinking it was engineered for at least 3-4 years but sure enough it lasted just over 12 months. This is an upgrade from the disposer installed in your home most of the time but do not purchase it as a replacement. Spend the extra $50-$100 and do it once rather than $80 here and then $80 in a year. Your time is worth money. This is however a great option if selling your house depends on replacing the disposal.
2,"By Evolution model, not Badger","I too have one that leaked water through the casing. I can understand if it fails after awhile where the blades wear out or motor wears out but they shouldn't have a casing that opens up and leaks water in the under sink cabinet.I've replaced this with a more expensive Evolution model. It costs more but I figure over a 10 year span, I'll have saved more money and frustration than buying Badger models over and over. Too many Badger reviews also say their casings leaked."
1,Another Cracked Casing... Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"I am convinced that the number of 'leak' reviews here (and elsewhere) points to one conclusion.... InSinkErator has clearly engineered this disposal to structurally fail so that you will then buy their more expensive products. My unit is just two years old and has multiple cracks in the molded metal casing. The internal wiring is likely to be getting wet, since the cracks are all over the unit.I'm considering buying another brand, but they have conveniently designed the collar (the only well-made part of this unit and hardest part of a new install) to accept any of their higher priced models. I feel like sending them a bill for the water damage this unit has caused.Here's an idea... stop selling this crap and design a slightly more expensive/safer unit that doesn't cause your customers to consider going elsewhere. Let's hear it for the InSinkErator marketing team for tarnishing an established household name through designed failure! Wheee!"
2,Buy something better,"Well, this disposer is cheap. It's also noisy and vibrates a lot, so you get what you pay for. Also it rusted out and started leaking after five years. I would spend the extra money up front and buy a higher quality model."
1,Another cracked case - Pick a different disposer!,AVOID THIS PRODUCT! I'm yet another owner with a cracked case on my Badger 1 which led to leaks. The internal blades are also completely rusted. The disposer probably only lasted about two years before the crack occurred. The best feature of this disposer is that it's easily replaced with a better unit because of the common mounting system. I can't believe anyone continues to buy this after reading reviews.
2,Cheap piece of junk!,"Loud, inefficient, below grade disposal. Will not grind anything but wet cereal. It WILL give up on you after about 5-6 years of light use. Buy the evolution model and save your money and your time."
1,new house 2 years 4 months ago,"and when I first moved in I thought that it was very quiet and in spite of the fact that my very first disposal over 46 years ago was an InSinkErator that I did not like, I felt this was great. But then the reason I am here is because it looks like we may have to replace it before too much longer. I put apples in it every night and it can't even grind up an apple for me. It is at a point where it will work one day and not the next. I am going to go for a generic brand next time. Brand name things are not what they used to be when my husband and I were first married 47 years ago. My washer from this new move a little over 2 years ago went out tonight as well."
3,Not what's advertised,"The title on Amazon for this product shows 1 1/3 HP. It was only after I ordered and recieved the product that I found out they have cleverly titled it the InSinkErator Badger 1....and that's only 1/3 HP. It's both false advertising on the manufacturer's part and ignorance on Amazon's part that they've listed it so poorly. It may be a fine product, but we never even opened the box. Once we realized it was only 1/3 HP, we immediately returned it for a full refund."
1,Badger 1 leaked through bottom casing,The Badger 1 disposal in my kitchen leaked through the bottom casing plate after only a few short years. This is a repeat discripancy noted in other reviews at Amazon. I do not recommend this product.
3,Works well until it fails,This is my 3rd one in 6 yrs. Works great until it fails. Easy install. Probably should buy a 1/2 HP motor but then I'd have to install the whole new setup instead of just sliding the same model on the existing fitting.
2,Stopped working after 3 years,"After 3 years of very light use, ( maybe used 2-3 times a week) it has stopped working. There is visible rust inside the unit where the sink drains into it. Just makes a grinding sound. Not cool"
1,"Dont ever buy a badger, plastic piece of junk cracked",cracked within little time and started leaking on the side so i pluged it with some plastic glue..next it cracked on the other side so i decide to ductape it. Few months later started to leak on both places again so decided to get a wasteking. Dont waster your money and time with this company.
1,2.5 yrs of use,"Was a new install in our house and motor burnt out after 2.5yrs of minimal use from a 2 person family. I expected many more years from it. Went with the waste king for the replacement. Should have it tomorrow and expect much better results. Consumer reports recommended the waste king. And honestly, the price on the waste king is very comparable to this product."
3,Did Ok,"To be fair, I do not have a lot of experience with garbage disposals. This one came with out home, and we used it for 6 years. I guess the solenoid went out because it began to operate intermittently, ad then finally crapped out. For $75 bucks, I guess 6 years is not bad. It is what it is."
2,Badger 1 leaks after 3 years,It appears that these models are built to leak. I should have read the reviews before I purchased mine. Looks like I make the move to a Waste King.
1,Cracked case - can no longer use.,"We are very disappointed in the quality of this product. After 5 years of moderate use, a crack appeared in the side, causing water to spray everywhere in the cabinet and on the floor. This is now a useless product to me and I will be looking at other manufacturers to replace my disposal. I'd heard such good things about this brand, but clearly this is a problem with this model."
4,I learned a lot--and had fun doing it!,"I bought this book to make a reproduction quilt for a friend who does Civil War reinactments. I was enthralled by the history I learned in this book. I've never found history interesting, but this book took me into the lives of the women who made the quilts. The only disappointment was that the main focus was on Union quilts. Ms. Brackman mentioned several Confederate quilts, but never published a picture or a reproduction of the quilts. I realize that Confederate quilts are rare (and I learned WHY in the book), but I would have liked a better balance. All and all, I found this book to be quite informative. I even bought an extra for my mom who doesn't quilt, but loves Civil War history."
3,"This book is not worth the price, in my opinion","Having read and reviewed many books about quiltmaking, patchwork and the like, and also having read other of Brackman's books, I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in the projects and the directions for the ""civil war"" quilts etc. The patterns are not full size, which is not unusual, and there were very few authentic quilt photos of the civil war era. Most of the quilts featured were reproductions that varied widely from the originals, and did not inspire me to want to re create them. The text and background work, and also the repro quilts featured were good. I also would have liked an address of where they obtained the fabrics, and could not find out from reading the book. I checked this book out from the library, and would not highly recommend it...but, you may want to purchase it for the elaborate text if you loved the civil war."
1,A customer,"I am surprised that this book was so highly rated. It appears to be as much or more about the slavery issue than quilts of the era. Barbara Brackman says in the Introduction: ""I realize where my prejudices lie...."" She writes: ""Many Southern white women were at a disadvantage in the first months of the war because they had no practical sewing experience."" Since about 7% of southerners owned slaves (By the way, slavery should be evil to all of us), I would guess that most Southern women were poor or near poor in the 1860s and knew survival skills, one of them being growing, processing cotton and sewing. I think I prefer Ken Burns' version of the Civil War history.I felt that many quilts of the era were missing. I also thought that much quilting information was lacking in this book."
3,Left a lot to be desired.,"You would expect a book with this title (misleading)to be a little more complete. It seemed as though the book consisted of page after page of P-51 and P-38 pictures, most sitting on the ground.There is nothing at all about the aircraft of the Pacific theater much less Their Japaneses rivals."
5,poems by a powerful modern poet,"Another wonderful collection of poems by Cirino. It is well worth the time and effort to get to know and appreciate this poet. My favorites include the lyrical poems, especially the poem ""The Phoenix: Sunday Morning Before Solstice"". Cirino's poetry is powerful, able to make you cry, laugh, and think. He has been for some time and remains a poet worth discovery. -Kenn Mitchell"
5,WHOO HOOO!! I like my GRASS BLUE!,"These guys play bluegrass without some kinda gimmicky-trying-to-be-hip crap sticking out of their pockets. This is the ROCK n ROLL of the Mountains! I love the traditional takes on the songs like ""Medicine Springs"" and ""Wild Bill Jones"", but the new songs like ""Lisa's Joy"" and ""I Don't Mind"" sound like they've been played for years. Each tune is catchy to stick in your craw all day long. The Busted Hearts play it loud, straight up, and to the hilt. I'm thinking now that punk rock got it's cues from Tennessee Bluegrass. WOW."
4,Definately Warm!,My husband loves this hat and finds it extremely warm. We've seen similar hats for a lot more money. Good deal for this product!
3,funny looking,Hat seemed to be made well enough but looked really funny on my head. I had to return it. If you only wear it with the flaps down it would be fine.
4,Not Too Bad,"I bought this CD for ''Hold On To My Love'' because it is one of my best disco tunes from the early 80s but very rare on any CD. I knew this CD is re-recorded one, mainly thanks to the previous reviewer, so did't anticipated much. However, I have found the recording condition and sound quality is not bad and almost satisfactory, even though the original recordings are naturally better. The low price is also attractive."
2,mediocre.,"a mediocre attempt at a biography. Extremely poor acting and a ridiculous plot surrounding the ""biography"". Robert Ripley was much more interesting than shown. Many mistakes, poor interviews. Rating=c. Seems like a highschool student really did film it!"
4,Recompilation plus,"I bought this cd mainly to get one favorite cut by Donald Fagen that I was only able to find years ago on a tape of the movie soundtrack Bright Lights, Big City. That is Century's End. I now have it on a more secure media as the tape is starting to distort. Another bonus is the other Fagen single, True Companion. I searched on many online download stores but was no able to find since they were probably only offered as singles."
3,"""All the pretty......pretty ones.....""","Most of you techies out there can almost burn a copy of this disc save the final few tracks. I would only recommend this to the most devout ""Dan-heads"".That being said, the introduction to the live version ""Bodhisattva"" has got to be one of the most interesting live sound bites in music history. A drunk introduces the band and has multiple moments of incomprehensible murmuring and slurring which brings you to the point of being bored and then the band crashes into the beginning of the song. This final track is worth the price of the CD."
3,Mold Sold Cold,"Putting together a hits collection for the duo that tried not to have any hits is probably futile, at best. Even so, this is an unusual collection. I suppose this was supposed to compliment the long deleted ""Greatest Hits"". These songs are best heard in the context of the original albums."
2,Compare the vinyl,I've returned to Steely Dan after a long absence and after hearing Cousin Dupree on 'Two Against' which rekindled old desires. I have this album on vinyl but as I got rid of my deck a few years ago with the advent of CD I decided to buy the CD especially as it contained bonus tracks. Frankly I wish I hadn't bothered. My favorite Dan track is FM and the ending with the extended sax solo has ruined it for me.The bonus tracks are also a waste of listening time. Is there an unmastered copy of the original Gold album out there somewhere?
4,Yet another Dan repackage with hidden value,"The tunes on this disc speak for themselves to any Dan fan. Chances are you already have some of this in your CD collection. However, like all of these repackages, the boys have elected to include something that will require the hardened DanFan to own it. In this case there is a special mix of ""FM"" that includes a very angular Phil Woods sax solo on the long outro instead of the guitar solo which has been in several previous released versions. For fans of the actual movie, this is the mix that was played during the final credits. For a danophile such as myself, this one track makes the CD worthwhile."
3,"FM, Western World","There are two reasons for a sane Dan fan to buy this CD: FM and Here at the Western World. Those *are* good reasons, tho'. Thanks to MCA for putting them both on the same disc.Most of the rest is on studio albums. Fagen's songs are alright, but I think most can live without them. I know I can.The live version of Bodhisattva really kicks, and is worthwhile, but I have to differ with Mr. Caylow's review - the drunken introduction is excruciatingly annoying."
3,Not really a work of genius.,"I obtained a copy of this book mainly because i was interested on the section about Botvinnik. Kasparov or Plisetsky gives a reasonable account of Botvinniks chess career and this is easily the best section.After the section on Botvinnik the book isnt really that good, the sections on Euwe and Smyslov being average and the section on Tal is very dissapointing.Infact the section on Tal gets me abit mad as Kasparov wastes lots of space with pointless analysis that nobody is ever going to follow. Kasparov never really comments about Tals openings repertoire at all, i can find no mention or discussion about Tal playing the modern benoni or what he played against kings pawn openings.Surely if Kasparov wants to write a book about his great predecessors he should mention a little bit more in depth the way the players played or the systems that they used.The book is reasonably good dont get me wrong, but its not a work of genius like ive heard it described."
3,Bad notational format,"I have a major issue with the books notational format. All 40 of my other chess books have the main line as a new paragraph, in bold type, so as to separate it from non-main-line analysis.This book often, and ""randomly"", imbeds the main line, albeit in bold, inside a paragraph analyzing alternative lines. I don't know the motive for this break with tradition, maybe to save space, but in any case it makes the game extremely difficult to follow especially when you have several different books open and playing the same historic game.As an example, on page 242, a single paragraph starts with a single main line move, then two rows of alternatives, then 3 main line moves, then two more rows of alternatives, followed by a single main line move. And this is all contained in one single paragraph.My 3 rating is based solely on the books new, non-traditional, notational format."
1,Hi-MD is a lemon!,"SonicStage software occasionally causes irreperably damage audio files. This is a fact. I have lost several discs during title labeling, downloading and especially during recording. The ""Cannot Record Cannot Read"" error message means that the disc and all of the data is irreperably damaged. Sony has the recovery program but will not release it to the public. Moreover, Sony acknowledges that Hi-MD was not field tested. Sony does not take responsibility for selling the hi-MD--it is a lemon. My own experience with Hi-MD as been disappointing. I do not recommend this product. Don't make my mistake. Save your money and wait for quality to catch up with technology.Lee"
1,A Piece of Garbage,"DON'T & I MEAN DON'T buy this piece of garbage that Sony has decided to make without testing thoroughly,its no wonder that they no longer make this.The Sonic software that it comes with didn't work so I had to go to their site & download a newer version.That worked fine for one day and I managed to transfer files from it to my computer.The second day the ""recorder"" started having problems.It would lite up & the minute I attached the cable to transfer files from it to my computer it would shut off.I recharged the battery,still the same problem, so for the price of over $300.00 for this piece of crap,I'm going to take my size 12 shoes & stomp the hell out of it.I will never again buy anything with the Sony name & with that said,even if Jesus himself came back & gave this a 5 out of 5 rating,I would comment to him in that wonderful Seinfeld tradition,""I don't think so""."
2,A truly ordinary film...,"Great cast but the movie is just a drag. A tad bit clichéd and just plain boring at times.I love independent movies but ""An Ordinary Family"" was rather disappointing."
4,As much as I hate Inuyasha...,"... This is one great soundtrack. Regardless of it's status of an Anime Soundtrack, it's a great J-Pop sampler."
5,Memories !,"This album contains several tracks that wil bring you back to memory lane and will make you jump up & down, left and right. It's a boomin', one of a kind, unprecedented album that set the tone for other artists of this genre. This makes me remember my first nights of ""jangueo y pariseo"" when I was younger...Collect it, Janet !!!!!!"
3,excellent study of how Japanese schools work,"the author is an American anthropologist, and a Mom. She sent two kids to a Japanese public school, and sat back to watch what happened. I admired the book, and learned from it, because the author seems to have no axe to grind. She also demonstrates that a lot of stereotypes about Japanese schools are wrong. For example, she finds disciplinary rules considerably looser than in American schools, with kids given much more responsibility at earlier ages than in the U.S. Her experience tracks closely with what happened to 2 of my kids in a Japanese public school."
5,Narrative based upon Lincoln archived photos and interviews with designers.,"10-12-12Rating 6-Stars on a 5-Star basis. James W. (Bill) Howell's book, Lincoln 1958-1969, engages the reader in the chronology of production designs which encompass the 1958-1960, then the 1961-1969 models. The book includes Lincoln Styling Studio images as far back as 1955 for styling exercises of the 1958 Lincolns and Continentals. He incorporates the inner workings, personnel changes and overall themes for each year interspersed with designer's interviews.Overall, a book that you can't put down. The archival images of the men working on the clay designs with the renderings posted on walls behind them are captivating."
1,not very good,"this book was written by an author well known for writting about the NHL, hockey. soccer and hockey are worlds apart, the book seems aimed at american audiences who do not know much about soccer, actually do not know anything about soccer.the book contains no real facts, it is like a summary of ronaldo's life, news i could get off tabloids.what really frustrated me though is how the author keeps calling a shot a punch! if you strike the ball it can be called many things, shot, kick, fired, scored even blasted, but for gods sake not ""Punched"" punched emplies using your hand, nobody used their hands in soccer..............except ofcourse the goalkeeper, which by the way is called goal tender in this book (its the hockey thing i tell you)overall i think i've wasted my money, the book is a disgrace to one of the worlds best strikers, it is written in a horrid way as well, and worse off really has no solid facts, no why, where when. just a brief summary."
5,Akira Toriyama's finest and most original Dragonball Movie,"The newest movie in the Dragonball series poses young Goku at his finest level of fighting. Join Piccolo, Trunks, Goku, Bolma, and others as they fight for the life of a young princess. A title no anime fan should be without!"
1,don't be ripped off,"This book is an excellent resource. But don't pay $200 for it here! That is outrageous! Especially for an out-of date version! Current edition is 8th edition. It can be purchased through the International Fluid Power Society for about $20. If you don't know who the IFPS is, you are a moron and you shouldn't be designing fluid power systems!!!"
2,Not purchased as a toy,"Hello,My daughter LOVED the figures but she is an adult not a child. She collects things Halloween and Nightmare Before Christmas is one of her favorite movies. She displays them rather than plays with them but I am sure that they bring out the child in her even so.Barbara P.Grand Rapids,MI"
1,Bad Cartridge,"I have purchased this HP 78 color cartridge to have it on hand, so I would have a replacement. I have just gone to my desk to use it and the box was spotted with ink. It is leaking. I needed to know about receiving a refund on my account."
2,Printer Cartridge Purchase,"The HP 78 Tri-Color Printer Cartridge I purchased was not good. The colors were off and no matter what I tried to do to correct it or recalibrate the printer, it did not work. Very disappointed. Ended up going to down to the local Wal-Mart to purchase another cartridge."
3,Decent ink cartridge,"This is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP. It performs exactly as you'd expect. The price from amazon is good. The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club (and why do you want so many cartridges for printers that become obsolete so fast) or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit, which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff. If you need this cartridge, buying it from amazon makes sense - the cartridge will be the same no matter where you buy it so why not go with the best price?"
1,Wrong answer,"I have nothing against the product itself. My complaint is the fact that when I entered the information about my printer as to whether or not this cartridge would work, the information I received said it would. Well, it won't. The cartridge fit in the printer, but the printer will not operate with that cartridge. My printer is an HP Deskjet 722C. The HP No. 78 Tri-Color Inkjet Print Cartridge (C6578DN) will not work. I suggest you change your information so others will not be mis-informed as I was."
1,Consistent Problem: NO YELLOW INK!,"I have purchased 3 of these cartridges, from 3 different stores, and NONE of them will print yellow. When I blot the printhead with a tissue, only the magenta and cyan appear. This is RIDICULOUS! I am planning to buy a new printer just to avoid having to use anymore no. 78 inkjet cartridges."
1,Bad color ink cartridge,"This was the first time I had ever ordered a cartridge from thisthis company. The cartridge had bad streaks, and left a horrible image of color ink on my clipart pictures and photo's. When I emailed this company they did not get back with me until days later. I have not received my replacement cartridge."
1,DOesn't Fit DeskJet 812c,I was outraged to find that the ink fit my printer but would NOT work! When I put the information into the computer it said that it would work with this type of printer! I am letting you know so that you don't make the same mistake as I am. I am going to try to see if they will give me a refund...I will keep you posted as to how that went since the box is opened.
1,Horrible,I received the HP78 tri-color ink cartridge right away. I installed the cartridge and now everything I print out is PINK!
1,HP 78 color cartridge,"Cannot get it to align, and the colors are way off. Colors are pink and continues to give me a message to align."
1,Defective Print Cartridge,"The print cartridge was defective. It did not print at all. I tried another identical cartridge I had and it worked fine, so my printer is OK, but your cartridge just doesn't print. Can I get a replacement?"
3,Ink Replacements,I'm not sure if I am the only one but I seem to run out of ink fast withthese little cartridges. I am not real happy with this printer.
4,Great Ink for Great Printers,"Owning a 970 CSe, this ink cartridge does wonders. High quality imagery, through vibrant colors, this ink cartridge is just fantastic. Not only that, but it tends to dependanable, I only give it 4 stars, due to price. But, if you want something that's good, you have to pay for it, and this is surely no exception."
1,"unable to use, company wouldn't return","We purchased 2 color ink cartidges back in November. In our dental office, we order in advance and we don't use color ink much, being that we print mostly xrays. Both cartidges were missing yellow ink so we could not use. We asked for an exchanged and they said ""no"" b/c of a 30 day return policy. They were not budging, not even willing to replace one being that it was the first time ordering from that company. I even told her I'm never ordering from them again and writing a bad review, she replied ""ok"". Well, here's their bad review!"
1,Worthless,"I received my order today of two (2) HP 78 color printer cartridges for my vintage HP 1220C. Neither of the printer cartridge worked; absolutely no color on the test pages except black. I was extremely disappointed to discover the dates on the cartridge boxes were May 2007 and July 2007. Obviously, the cartridges, and ink contained in them, has a life. These were knowingly sold well past the date on the box (5 years!). Extremely disappointed!"
4,Beautiful color at last,"Outstanding color, very easy to load in just a few seconds. It does tempt you to print all the photos you have been storing on disc. No problems with lines or blotches when printing. Great product only suggestion for improvement would be more ink."
1,HP ink 15 +78 combo-pack,"I purchased the tri-color ink cartridge. It would not print vivid colors such as red and yellow. I contacted HP and they insisted that the problem was the (HP)printer that they consider obsolete. I swapped out the old low level HP tri-color cartridge and it printed perfectly. Replacing the old cartrige with the new one produced the same results with the colors not printing. They recommended purchasing one of several other HP printers that use the FHP 78 tri-color ink. Then if the new cartridge still printed muted colors, it could be the ink cartrige itself. HP would not recognize that the cartridge could be defective in my printer. HP did not try and replace the ink or admit that the ink could be the problem. Very poor support for an expensive product (the ink costs $60.) It seems I would have been better off purchasing it at a big box store at a higher price with the hope of better service."
4,Very Good Buy,I believe this is a very good buy. I have looked elsewhere and the prices are much higher for the same product.
4,It did the job,"Colors come out nicely. Price is a bit high.. only bought it because my other ""non-name brand"" refills were a waste of money; they were ""full"" but didn't work."
2,HP 78 Tri-Color Printer Cartridge,The colors for the cartridge are washed out and faded. I should have had the original cartridge refilled at Costco
5,Re: Non OEM Replacement Cartridge,Oem replacement failed. I have 2 hp inkjets that I am testing.I have never had A PROBLEM WITH AN OEM BEFOREUNTIL NOW.
1,Does NOT work with my hp deskjet 940C.,"Does NOT work with my HP deskjet 940C, so I wasted a lot of money for junk. Don't buy this product!"
4,"Goggles is great and has beautiful, dark-color illustrations","Goggles teaches a lesson that anyone can win at any given time. It's a true story about the author running away. All the big boys were trying to get Peter, the character in the book. They were fighting over goggles. It's one of my favorite books by this author, Ezra Jack Keats."
3,Goggles,"This is a very good book. It is about two boys who live in the ghetto. When they were in a junkyard playing around, Henry stumbled upon a pair of motorcycle goggles. They looked great on him. One the walk home two bullies want to take the goggles. The punk pushes henry down and the goggles fall out. Everyone looks at them, Then the dog runs off with them. The boys split up and go to the secret hideout. The dog gos slowly after. They run though a pipe and give the goggles to henry.Well hope you enjoy reading this book. It is written by Ezra Jack Keats. It is one of the many books she has written, hope you get a chance to read them all."
3,Goggles!,"I enjoyed reading the book Rich Cat, Poor Cat! It was about these two cats one is a street cat and is poor, scubby, dirty, no one pays attention to him, and he has to find his own way to live, his own shelter, food, and the other cat is a indoor cat that lives with a very rich family that cleans, feeds, give shelter, and takes care of him! Yes, I think this book is great for kids because it makes you think about all the cats out there that don't have homes! I think children would like to read this book because it teaches you things about cats and you should take care of every pet you own!"
4,Great Read Aloud,I read this book and used the Linda Hoyt read aloud book as a guide. This is a fantastic book to use to teach sequence.
5,Fushigi Yugi,"One of the best books i read,very sad, The gang left a treasure behind for the memory- im not telling who it is but is sad ;-;Poor Tasuki was the one who was crying the most. Then they all left in sorrow to go north. Please read this book its worth every penny...."
4,magic will survive,"It's funny how some people here cry ""he broke the code!"" and give it 5 stars, and others make THE SAME CRY, and give it one... I don't think the magic in magic is entirely in not knowing how it's done, more, its in the presentation. As demonstrated every day, when we enjoy fiction and theater, we CAN suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy an artistic or spectacular presentation. We know that is NOT Richard II up there on that stage, and we know that magic is an illusion, but we allow ourselves to believe it is, at least for the moment, what it seems to be.In other words, though somewhat demystified by this series, I think magic will survive. As someone else here said, magicians will continue to invent ever more amazing tricks, which will continue to astound audiences for a long time to come. Those of us who wish to keep the most magic in magic need not watch this expose."
1,hmmm....,"This video should be banned. The person that reveals these illusions violated copyright and patent by showing the secrets to these illusions. There is a difference between this video and instructional videos. This is video merely gives the secrets, whereas an instructional video explains the secrets, as well as, methods, history and other information about the trick, and has enough background in magic to know that half the fun of seeing magic is not knowing the secret. I'm thoroughly displeased as a magician."
5,great deal,this is a great rod for surf fishing. action is perfect and the rod is strong. i took it to malibu for a little surf fishing and had no problems landing a leapord shark. ive got it paired with a okuma abf 90. i liked it so much i ordered a 12 footer with a abf 60.
4,Decent - terrible shipping?,"This may or may not have been the seller. But there is a part of me that is pretty sure it was. The rod came to me in a box that had been taped together. At first I thought the post office did it, but the tape used to 'repair' the box was the same tape that was originally used for shipping. The pole arrived broken and two rings werent bent severely. Fortunately - Amazon took care of replacement relatively quickly. But I would definitely advise opening up your box from them IMMEDIATELY to see if it's in good shape. The pole is definitely killer for the price. It's not the best pole I have, but for the money I wouldn't be able to get better."
2,To heavy,The pole was too heavy so ended up not using it. I sold it during a yard sale for half the price I bought for. Ended up buying a better pole for $100 at a sportsmens. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,invest in a better rod,"this rod is heavy to handle, the rod's ""ceramic guide inserts"" easily break.the rod gets stuck when put together.needless to say save your money,pay a bit extra & get a better rod like the Daiwa beefstick.you don't need any rod longer than 11 or 12 ft. I ended up returning it to amazon after a nasty cut on my hand due to ceramic guides breaking."
1,Junk,"Okuma Fishing TU-120 Tundra 12-Foot 2-Piece Surf/Pier Spinning Rod (Large, White/Blue)The third time that I used this rod 2 guides came out.I did not abuse the rod. I am 73 years old and have been taking care of fishing equipment since I was 7.Sadly the time to return this thing has expired."
4,Novice Fisherman,The pole looks solid but I want to remind people that it does not come with a reel. Now I am looking for a reel...
3,"Quality reel, but uncomfortable.",It is a quality reel but the handle is too large for prolonged use. I returned it for a Daiwa Regal Plus Saltwater Bite & Run 5000. Will forever remain a Daiwa fan.
4,Kuma's Long Pole,I checked out this surf rod and the Ugly Stick surf rod at my local Sports Chalet. They both felt like good solid rods. The biggest differences were in the color and the price. The Ugly Sick is black and the Tundra white. The Okuma Tundra retails for less than half of what the Ugly Sick sells for.My Sports Chalet did not have the 15' model in stock and that is where I first discovered Aamozon.com. They found me the Tundra in the length I wanted and mailed it to me within a week for no shipping or freight charges.
4,Awesome !,Gave this as a gift and the recipient keeps thanking me. He loves it and has caught several fish already.
4,Okuma Fishing TU-150 Tundra 15-Foot 3-Piece Surf/Pier,I love this pole..Must sand the connections or you cannot take the pole appart. I did not sand them sufficiently and i left it togeather for several months.. I finnaly had a friend help separate it after several months.... I sanded it some more and all is well now..
3,Item not as described!,"I ordered an Okuma Tundra TU-100 rod on September 17,2012. In the product features, the rod is described as having a line weight of 10-25 lbs. The rod that I received has a line weight of 20-50 lbs. This a much heavier rod! For the cost, it is not worth shipping back to Amazon, as I no longer have the shipping carton. I destroyed the carton before I noticed the mistake. If I needed the heavier rod, it seems well made. The shipping was quick."
4,Affordable,"I like this rod for the price, I'm not up on fishing rods but for 30 bucks I couldnt pass it up! There is a 14' down the street for 70! And amazon gave me free shipping. I didnt find anything wrong with it I would buy it again."
5,Passing the NG Exam,"I took Sarvang's 4.1 Check Point class a couple years ago and, based on his teachings, easily passed the test. Now I have his book and it has been an excellent resource for studying for the NG exam. If you go through the book and the review questions, you'll definitely pass the test."
4,Everything you need to know for CCSE,This book was great. Very helpful in preparing me for the CCSE NG FP3 exam. The step by step instruction for the labs and the exercises at the end of the chapters were extremely helpful in my preparation. I plan to keep this one on the desk for reference. Two thumbs up!
5,Fresh Pants,"This is the best Dotsero CD yet. Full of energy, soul, funk. Green Goblin rocks, My Leap of Faith is beautiful, Just Because is funky and fun. Completely in love with Dotsero's version of Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion !!!!"
5,My Daughter LOVES It,"Mr. Young is really onto something! This book and CD with original songs is fresh, witty, practical, and a complete hit with my 11 year old daughter Emily and her friends. Murphy is a HOOT! We can't wait for the next book in the series."
4,Good video,"This was good for its in-depth interviews with the women who danced for Balanchine (Maria Tallchief, etc). For someone looking for more studio footage, however, this may not be the video for you. While certainly interesting, it is interview- heavy."
2,"Cute, but small on substance","While this video gives a great account of Balanchine and the persona of the dancers who he was particularly attracted to, it fails to deliver much in the way of substantial information. Balanchine is continually underrepresented in academic study. If you're looking for something a little more meaty, try Robert Garis' book ""Following Balanchine"". This video is a fun watch though. The woman with the flower is something to behold!"
5,This is steak not hamburger.,"I've heard Three Dog Night without Chuck and now Three Dog Night without Cory and Danny and believe me, this is MUCH better! This live concert recording makes me hope that Chuck Negron comes to a concert venue near me so I can hear it live myself. This recording is ""nostalgia"" for the old Three Dog Night Fans but sounds just fresh enough for (hopefully) some new listeners. For a true live recording the sound is quite good, the instrumentation is great and oh that voice of Chuck's.....makes me want to hear more!"
5,Chuck Negron - LIVE IN CONCERT,"This is a GREAT listening experience. For a Live performance album anyway. The band behind Chuck is tight, clean and right on with their vocals and accompaniments! However, Chuck's phenomenalvoice was not so phenomenal. His own signature hits like, ""One"", ""Easy To Be Hard"", and a couple of others were just fine. But when it came to the vocals on many, they seemed a bit weak. The back up vocals by other band members stood out more. Which is a coup for Chuck, putting together such a superb group of musicians.Yet, the only new song, ""Voices"" by Chuck from his first solo album was superb!I gave this album 5 stars: 3 for the band, 2 for Chuck.I am a Chuck Negron fan regardless. It is great to see the Best of the 3 Dog Night threesome doing what he does best.Now it is time for more new and original Chuck Negron songswithout the usual baggage carried over from 3DN."
2,I guess I'm just different....,"It's a weird world when we have Chuck Negron putting out albums of TDN hits, and Danny Hutton and Corey Wells (performing as TDN) putting out albums of TDN hits. Listening to Chuck sing songs such as Black and White (originally Hutton) or Never Been to Spain (originally Wells) is jarring to say the least. It just doesn't sound right. It's like having Hutton sing Joy To The World (originally Negron). Doesn't work.Negron does well on the songs on which he originally sang lead, such as Joy To The World, One, etc.TDN is a case of being greater than the sum of the parts. This album proves it."
4,Bought it along with vol. 2 on a whim,Just as I said I bought this on a whim. I flipped through the book and Horyu caught my eye. The stories seems disconnected at first but as I read on they aren't. The events are just that...events in the life of two bishonen. The side stories are nice also. It's got just enough angst to keep you interested but not enough to depress you. The thing I really liked was the love between Horyu and Shouin and how their relationship developed throughout the two volumes. I think anyone looking for a boys love story will enjoy this.
3,One word: Dull.,"Defiantly not the best Yaoi Manga out there, but this series may get better. It's about two friends who confessed their love to one another and bobs your uncle. Average story but instead of being mainly situated in a school, it plays around the fact the Seme is a surfer.There's not a lot to keep you motivated into buying the next few titles, but it may get better. It's rather dull in areas and easy to guess what will `happen next' but it's up to others. Maybe other people saw a better Manga then I did."
2,Sorry I bought it,"I bought this phone based on the Consumer Reports review and the largely positive on-line reviews here. I also bought three additional handsets. This phone system is awful. The range is terrible; anything over 20 feet gets static and occasional dropped calls. The battery life is awful, you can only get about 1 day of battery life and that's if you're not using it, so basically you have to keep it on the charger. I only bought this a few months ago, and already one of the handsets has died completely. Minor problems are: a horrible menu system; caller ID doesn't show the name only the number; if you try to redial a number that just called you it dials the area code first with no ""1"" in front of it so if you use it, you'll be calling a wrong number. Even though I have sunk several hundred dollars into the base and three additional handsets, I will probably junk the entire system because it's just not worth the hassle."
4,Way better than Panasonic,"I'm sorry but I just don't get the problems people are having with this phone. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I still prefer the Vtech i5867. But guess what? Vtech had to have made this phone. The menu is the same, the ringers are the same, and the sound options/quality is the SAME. I did read something about Vtech and AT&T being linked somehow, well this is practically a Vtech phone. With the i5867 you can record your own ringers and put your own pictures on it, that's what I like better than this phone. That being said, this is still a good quality phone. I like the earpiece VOLUME, I can hear people! EVERY Panasonic I've EVER talked on was horribly LOW!! This phone has also already survived me dropping it (something that tends to happen in my house a lot). So in summary : Like the phone, would recommend it, planning on buying an additional handset."
3,Terrible battery life,The one disappointing aspect of this phone is the positively anemic battery life. My old Panasonic cordless could go 3 or 4 days before I would have to charge it. With this unit I have to put the handset on the charger at the end of every day. I would highly recommend purchasing the extra set of batteries that are stored and charged in the base. You'll definitely need them if you talk for any length of time on this phone.
4,main pros and cons,"This phone is top of the line AT&T has to offer. It includes all the features we often use as consumers. However, remember that this technology is rather new to the cordless phones market. If people learn about them and find out how they are best used, it will minimize the complaining factor. The only negitive thing i see about these new phones is their warrenty. When you pay that high the warrenty should be at least 3 years."
4,"Pretty good phone, but...","I've been using this phone for about 5 months now, and I'm reasonably happy with it. Sound quality is good, battery life sufficient for my purposes, etc.The big flaw is that the answering machine and the phone are not well integrated. The interface for configuring and using the phone is quite good. The interface for the asnwering machine is quite different and rather difficult. So the whole unit is somewhat like an apple glued to a pancake.A minor flaw is that calls are timestamped with the day of the week, not the date. This is fine unless you're going away for several weeks at a time."
4,Decent Phone - I'm Satisfied,"We bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago. One handset gave us problems from the start, but was promptly replaced when returned for service. The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home. I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house. As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street. I like the features, including paging system, call transfer, and handset speakerphone. Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus. I think the sound quality is very good, and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive. I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.Overall I feel it works as advertised, and we'll be using it for a long time."
2,Base transmission problem,"After weeks of problems with the handsets, I purchased two more new handsets only to find that I could would still receive a terrible signal. 4 of my 5 handsets had the same problem. Thinking it was a quality control issue with the handset I called cust. service, but they were of minimal help. I decided to swap out the base and sure enought that was the problem."
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to getting this phone, but first of all, I wanted a phone that was wall-mountable. This was advertised as such, but the bracket was missing and the seller didn't have one. I was going to try to locate one, but then I decided to at least try the phone first. I fully charged the battery and used it to make a local call. The clarity was very good, but then I noticed that it was echoing a little bit. The deciding factor came when after 15 minutes on the phone, the battery just died. This phone has some very good features, but the bottom line was it just didn't measure up so I sent it back."
2,Could have been better for the price,"It's just an okay phone, nothing special except the looks. Low battery life, voice quality on the answering machine is low also. unlike other expandable phones, this one can not tranfer info from phone to phone, so if a friend called you and you needed their number to return the call later, you have to find the phone they called in on to find the right call log, I have 3, I feel sorry for anyone that has more. The phone itself has good range and voice quality and speakerphone, for that I give it 2 stars"
4,good produce/ Bad customer service,"We purchased this item based on extensive consumer reports and research. It arrived in good condition and is exactly what we want. The manual is complex and not very user-friendly. The items that you would think would be listed together are scattered throughout the manual. With time and use, it has become easier. The screen bulges out and thus, get scratched easily because I often lay the phone face-down for quick answering. There was no clear plastic protective cover when purchased."
3,Nice battery hog,"Both incoming and outgoing voice seem to be very good. The phone is ergonomically acceptable, though nothing that should fetch a high price. It is silly that the base and handsets can't share a single directory. The reason I'm returning the phone is that it is a battery hog. Inexplicably, it comes with laughable 1400 mAh AA batteries, which really is embarassingly cheap of whoever AT&T licenses the brand to. But even when I put in a longer life Nickel Metal battery, it is drained far too fast. It sure is hard to buy a quality, reliable cordless phone anymore."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,VERY DISAPPOINTED!! I have a very small apartment (960 sq. ft)and if I take the phone 4 feet from the base it cuts out. The second phone has to practically be next to the base to function.
2,Features missing,For prospective buyers: This phone has no ability to transfer the phone book between handsets and/or base unit (you have to enter the number manually into each one) and has really irritating ring choices.
2,wireless LAN users please read this,"I do not own this wireless phonebut I was checking the replacement of Vtech, which has a lot of static, and the voicemail records without any reasonwhen I check this model, I found this phone is running on both 2.4 and 5.8GHz (same as Vtech)wireless owners, pls think twice before buying this unit"
2,too large for most soundholes,"I bought this to try it out. It will only fit in the soundhole of my dread or jumbo. Plus, you need to make certain that it is completely dry and not overflowing with water. I checked it after installation and the absorbent pad had allowed water to pool around the edges and, had I not checked it, would have created water damage where the unit touches the top wood. This is a poor design and I will stick with my other humidifiers."
3,kyser lifeguard steel string guitar humidifer,Very good item but I will not use because my instrument has the smallest hole and did not work anyway thanks.
1,Poor Design,"Unfortunately, in their directions Keyser forgot to mention the screwdriver. Yes, the one you need to fit this thing into the sound hole as directed. At first, I was glad to see that the Lifeguard is made in the USA. Right there in Detroit by the same guy who designed the Ford Pinto. Maybe it was really made in China and they stamped a ""made in USA"" label on it. Finally, I got tired of fighting it and, like others, I left the tab on one side ON THE TOP of the sound hole. Would it have been that hard for them to design and manufacture something so simple that actually fits?"
4,Legends in Their Own Time,"This is a must-have for crossword lovers. If updated to 2002, it would be of even more value. Has last names with occupation, other names used and even names of books or films made. There is also a dictionary in the back of the book with first names as the identifier."
5,coast led flashlight,"I am a physician, consequently I have gone through countless penlights. Most are pendarks and last for about three minutes. The fact that they were free is of little consolation when you need to see and the light dosen't work. The Coast LED is small, extremely bright, and lasts for months on end. After 6 months of using it up to 20 times per day it is just now beginning to get a little dim so I am going to change the batteries. If you actually need a light for a useful task I highly recommend an LED."
3,Not the most complete guide,"The Official U.S. Casino Chip Price Guide, Fourth Edition, is not the most complete chip guide out there, but does make a very good attempt on the subject.If you specialize in chips from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, this guide does provide one of the best sources for that casino. As for as other casinos like the Palms in Vegas only their basicchips were contained in the guide, none of the special releases(such as Playboy or Betty Paige) were in the guide.This guide does not feature any casinos in Arizona. I found a number of errors as well in the guide, a caption quoting a $5 chip as a $1 and a picture for a 3rd Edition Excalibur $5 chip, but no price or listing for that matter in the Guide itself."
4,A must have for chip collectors,Actually the title says it all. While somewhat out of date (it's been 3 years since this was published) it is the most comprehensive guide to casino chips at this time. I wouldn't bid on a chip without first looking it up in this guide.
2,For the rich and dedicated,Deals mostly with higher demominations of chips. Many people like myself collect as we travel and only collect $1 chips.
3,Limited Value,"While nice to look at I am finding it to be of very limited value and would not recommend it, but that is just me, I am sure others like it, but I feel it is out of date, does not cover everything it claims to cover"
4,US Casino Chip Price Guide,Living so close to Las Vegas we often get casino chips. In our second-hand business the knowledge of casino chip prices is an asset. This price guide is a wonderful handy resource.
2,Good quality. Cheesy movie,The movie was less than awe-inspiring but it was okay. #-D effects made it more worthwhile and worth the purchase.
1,not received,"I ordered this product in Dec and the first shipment was damaged and did not bother telling me, I only found out when I traced it and saw that and contacted Amazon and they re-ordered it and I received the other item on the order within 5 days but I have stil not received this item and it is going on 2 months"
2,Nada especial (nothing special),"Creo que Luis Miguel cante muy bien, sea guapo (para las mujeres) y tenga mucho talento. Pero esto no es suficiente para que salga un buen compacto. Canciones como Nada es igual estan bien, pero el tema es siempre lo mismo: no te vayas, quedate conmigo, te quiero besar. Armonia y melodia bastante simple, saltos armonicos demasiado fuertes. Nada especial. I think Luis Miguel sings very good, he's cool (for ladies) and talented. Unfortunately this is not enough to make a good CD. Songs like Nada es igual are ok, but the topic is always the same: don't go, stay with me, I want to kiss you. Simple armony and melody, strong armonic jumps. Nothing special."
5,FABULOSO,"ES EL MEJOR ARTISTA DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS, ESCUCHAR SU VOZ ES UN PRIVILEGIO..ES LO MEJOR QUE DIOS HA CREADO EN ESTE MUNDO."
5,El Rey!,"If the photograph on the cover doesn't convince you that Luis Miguel truly is ""the King"" of sensuality this cd will. His mezmerizing voice will ease you into candle lit dinners, slow dances and romance, then command you to ""feel latin"" even if your aren't. . . He'll have you dancing with ""a rose between your teeth"" swearing that you are!"
3,Very Good but not Great,"This was Luis's CD after the tremendous success of Concierto. It echoed back to his pre-Romance phase, but is not as well rounded as CDs such as Aries and En Busca de Una Mujer. The CD undoubtedly has some outstanding hits, among which are ""Suena"" and ""Dame,"" but on the whole, there is much better LM out there, still, for collectors, this is a definite addition to your collection."
5,ES MUY LINDO,"ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES CD QUE HE TENIDO EL GUSTO DE ESCUCHAR, TIENE TEMAS REALMENTE HERMOSOS QUE LLEGAN AL CORAZON."
1,not nesecary,"This Antenna Adapter is not nesecary for hook-up in a 2000 NISSAN FRONTIER, It has a standard plug like most American made vehicles.Metra 40-NI10 Nissan Antnna Adapter"
5,"Used in 2005 G35, works perfectly","Replaced the Bose headunit in my 2005 G35 using this adapter. Works exactly as designed.You'll have the extra ""tail"" on it that doesn't get plugged into anything, but don't worry about it.This model has the tabs included so that it locks into place with the original antenna wire, so there's no worries about it coming loose over time either.Performs exactly as designed and expected, radio comes in loud and clear."
3,Not Perfect,Product is good and fits fine.As a previous review mentioned. We also received better radio reception with the factory pins reversed. Used electrical tape to secure since the clip was reversed.
5,this is the perfect one!,"this is the only book which I've seen all the details,projects and photos together in it, about stand design.It's explained excellently the projects."
5,Finally a new DVD on Warhol,I was excited to see a new DVD was to be released about Andy Warhol a month ago. I bought this right away when it was finally released only to find out it is a documentary that was created in Canada that was broadcast on US television about 8 months ago. I had taped this when it aired so I was a bit disappointed to learn they are one in the same although it's nice to have it on DVD instead of tape. This is a great DVD and covers some new angles and material not found in 'Portrait of an Artist' or 'Superstar'. It's interesting to see some new interviews with members of the Warhola family. To see how they have aged since 'Portrait of an Artist' just proves it's about time something new was released. I highly recommend this DVD if you did not already watch it on television or if you are an avid fan of Andy like myself. Well worth the price of admission alone:-) Enjoy!
3,Informative but Generally Goofy,"Although the film is really informative and offers a great anectdote about Warhol's supposed asexuality, the film has a cheesy PBS documentary feel to it. It's high art approach to Warhol's life and art seem opposed to his own intentions in his work. There's still some amazingly funny moments, all unintentional."
3,Pantasya,"very well done, was disapponted withthe lack of nudity that was advertisedbut stories were well done"
4,The picture is misleading..,"I received the Fluke 63 IR thermometer and it is not per the picture on Amazon. The picture shows a device with buttons below the display but what I received had no buttons, just a plain grey surface, although the box and the device had ""63"" on them. The manual says the buttons only come with the 66 and 68 models. Misleading picture, not good......"
3,Avalancha De Exitos - Cafe Tacuba,"This is probably one of the best albums as far as cover albums go. They covered a few recent hits such as Botellita de Jerez's Alarmala de Toz, which actually sounds better than the original. They also cover the girl band Flan's No Controles in such a way that you would never imagine a male band to cover. They also bring back the popular classic Como te Extrano by Leo Dan. Overall this has to be a very enjoyable album by one of today's most entertaining and best of the spanish rock bands. Cafe Tacuba Rules."
3,Pequeno pero grande.,"Su sonido es tan abierto como antes, pero al abordar canciones ya conocidas por mucha gente, ellos tienen el instinto de crear una nueva tradicion musical. Estas canciones, de varios estilos musicales, son Mexicanizadas de una forma ideal. Aqui entra la genialidad de los Tacubos: ¿como lograr darle un nuevo sonido a una cancion de Leo Dan? ¿O como edificar una nueva irreverencia a 'No controles' mas alla de la fabricacion pop de Flans? Yo creo que hasta Juan Luis Guerra preferiria tocar 'Ojala que llueva cafe' de una manera que refleje el altiplano mesoamericano. Es una avalancha de exitos, pero con el sello idividualista y unico de los Tacubos. Es recuperar canciones y hacerlas actuales."
4,Musica de Cafe Tacuba,"Buenisimo, pero todovia no es el mejor disco. Ademas, el disco es excellent. Si te gusta Cafe Tacuba por seguro te disfrutara."
3,The most commercial of the Class Reunion Series...,"Of all the available volumes in the series, this one contains the most commercial, widely available songs. If you want a Class Reunion CD to provide you with hard-to-find songs, this isn't it. But if you want very pop-centric songs, get this CD."
3,Es bueno pero le falta algo...,"Este disco tiene muy buenas canciones, Calle Mayor es una de las mejores, pero entiendo que no se compara con su primer disco, que no encuentro aquí, que tenía canciones como El dorado y esperando mi tren. El disco necesita esa melodía que tiene el primero pero tiene canciones para recordar como El mismo Hombre y como dije Calle Mayor, que para las personas que no conocen a España, como yo, nos da una buena idea de como son algunas cosas allá. Los surcos de tu espalda es la canción romántica del disco pero no se compara con Por un beso. Por eso digo que es bueno pero le falta melodía e inspiración."
5,MST3K fans will love it,MST3K fans likely already have this in their collections.I purchased this DVD as a gift. The recipient loved it.
4,The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection Volume 2,"This is the nineth MST3K DVD box set that I have gotten. It contains three episodes. All of them are from the Comedy Central-era of the show. Unlike the first volume, this set contains only three entire episodes. The fourth disk in the set is packed with shorts from different seasons of MST3K. This set, like the first one, has moving parts on the front of it. The only problem that I had with the one I ordered was that a bit of the cover was missing. Somehow, it must have been torn off. Overall, I would recommend this set to any ""MSTie."" It's great fun."
3,Review of MST3K Vol 2.,I was hoping for the same greatness as Manos hand of fate and Santa Claus conquers the Martians. It's still pretty good at being awfull and that is the attraction I suppose.
5,Bravo! Finally a book with creditability.,"I must say! Hats off to the author of this book. Finally a Dillinger book that say's it all. I have read my share of gangster books through out the years, and I must say that this book is truely one of the great heavyweights on Dillinger and the gangster area that I have ever had the pleasure to read. It takes you along for the ride of a lifetime. It exposes and opens your eyes to new information. Im telling you folks, this book is a must read. Dillinger, The Hidden Truth....The title say's it all."
1,Complete Embarrassment ...,"Being the son of this so called ""Author,"" I have to say that I am utterly ashamed. My Dad's ""hard work"" he put into this poorly written book lack perfection on So many levels. I have to wake up to hearing his annoying childish bragging of ""I wrote a book!"" EVERY day of my life. I tell him, ""No, you didn't Write a Book. You just terribly pushed together a lot of misspelled and repeated information."" If you think the way he tries to explain everything in the book is bad, you should try hearing him just say a full sentence, with it actually making Some sense. I warn all who even think about wasting your money on this piece of garbage, Please save your money. Then again, it's always good to have a copy around if you're running low on toilet paper. That's all I have to say.- Keith"
4,An entertaining and interesting strory,"Despite the numerous typos and grammatical errors, for a first attempt to write a novel, I commend Tony Stewart for his courage to put pen to paper and to publish a story of this caliber for the world to see. Mr. Stewart exposes several issues, primarily that our government has the ability to be as corrupt as any other criminal enterprise. That is what we need to address and change. Notwithstanding, I do not believe in Dillinger's lifestyle, nor condone his actions as a criminal. Millions of other poor starving citizens survived the depression and came through all right. Dillinger: legend yes, hero no. A good and easy read, absolutely. I thank you."
1,Stay away from this book,"This is a semi-literate, poorly written vanity publication that is not worth even the Amazon.com discounted price. It is rambling, with poorly organized, run-on paragraphs. It has a decided dictated but not read, first draft quality that makes for a painful read. As history, it is also dubious, relying on absolutely no footnotes, endotes or citations. And what's the ""Hiddent Truth""? Stewart's thesis is that Dillinger and his ilk were not ""cold-blooded"" killers as characterized by the press and the FBI. No, being ""cold-blooded"" takes premeditation. Dillinger, et al., just killed when trying to escape from prison or the law or when shot at while robbing banks or kidnapping people. See, they really weren't so bad after all, just trying to make a living in the Depression. This is a vanity publication with no reason to be vain. Amazon.com should have have a warning when a book is self-published."

1,One of the few books that I could not finish . . . .,"When I purchase a book I usually finish reading it -- I feel compelled to -- but I just couldn't make it past the first chapter. This book is not very well written and, as someone already stated, the grammar and punctuation is a bit strange and distracting. I ended up putting the book in my ""destination Goodwill"" box so maybe someone else can read it and have a better experience."
2,Natural selection.,"Two star because it is indeed music from the show.Unfortunately, compared to how much good music is in the series, this CD sucks. Spend a little more money, get better rights."
2,Overrated,The songs actually played during the show seemed much better than what was on this album. Maybe the next season's soundtrack will be better????
5,good music,i bought this as a gift for my mom who is a huge fan of the show. she really likes all but one song. she said that the songs aren't exactly from the show itself but they are still good.
3,Fun but shallow,"Phoenix has a good sense of everyday humor, and in the millions of Kodachromes Americans shot from 1940 to 1980 there is plenty of material to make fun of. But I think he missed an opportunity for a more serious look at the era of the home slide show, the role of Kodachrome in preserving American history and the need to preserve potential treasures in our attics and basements. I also have to say that I have sold many slides that were of better quality than those used in the book. What I got from this book was an urge to do one myself."
2,Disappointed,"Good concept, but poor execution. The pictures look like the worst vacation pictures that weren't good enough to make it into the album. They look like the pictures that you might find on that awkward family photos website."
2,You can call him Al,Well. The poor bugger got sacked after having sacrified most of his life fixing things for the boys. The story is clattered with errors but that's probably because it is told straitght from the heart. This is probably also why you have to read some stories at least three times. Having complained before about this publishing house I will once again urge J.Blake to invest in a senior editor.
5,EXCELENTE,"este es el primer disco de lydia y es excelente, en ninguna otra parte lo podras encontrar!"
3,When good couples go bad,"Spousal abuse and adultery runs alongside the red thread of murder through Janet Neel's latest in her series about the British detecting duo of Francesca Wilson and John McLeish.""A Timely Death"" has the possibility of turning into a very hot book, part soap opera, part mystery, but we end up with a cool, conventional story that doesn't seem to make much of an effort to distinguish itself. Francesca's estrangement from her husband due to his long hours seems shallow and unconvincing, and makes her a unlikable lead. Left to his own devices, John is a cipher, meaning the suspects have to carry the load. Only the one of the characters, a female physician learning to escape an abusive boyfriend, gives ""A Timely Death"" its emotional power.-- Bill Peschel"
5,Good hat for price.,"For the price this hat is good quality. If you want a hat without paying the price of a stetson that you can use every day this one will do the job. The quality is good. Buying the size you need may be difficult, I found they ran a little larger than the size I usually wore although the fit was close enough that it was satisfactory. I would purchase the product again."
4,REALLY GOOD GAME!!,"GREAT GAME , BUT IT GOT CONFUSING SOMETIMES. THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND SO IS THE SOUND AND MUSIC.overall its a very good game!"
4,Great Game,"King Kong is a great game, full of adventure and excitement. It van be confusing sometimes, but if you're patient, you'll find a solutin to your problem. The screen can be very dark at times: the creatures are a dark gray or black, the rock is dark gray or black, you are usually in a cave so there is little light, the plants are ususlly darki red or green, and your weapons is gray or brown(if your using a spear. So it can be very difficult to see. You'd think that carrying a torch would help, but the flame on;y gets on your way.King Kong is a reat 1st person sooter, despite the flaws mentioined above. Playing as Kong is fun but it too is complicated. He only has on ""hit"" button and he caan also grab the enemy, and then use the two in a combo, but thats about it."
4,Shonen fun!,"Formerly known as 'Yami No Matsui', 'Descendants of Darkness' has been translated, much to the joy of American viewers - like me. :) This particular story deals with a violinist who involuntarily finds himself in a pact with the devil, and the hot dead guys (known as guardians of death) who are out to fix the situation. This arc is especially coherent, which is a plus. *Lots* of drama. Plenty of blood. Dan Green does a particularly good job as the voice actor for Tsusuke, our violet-eyed protagonist."
4,"Thoughtful lyrics sung to wild celtic, Spanish rock.","I am so glad that Celtas Cortos is finally available in the United States! I've enjoyed their music since seeing them in concert in Spain in 1992. Their enerjetic music and thoughtful lyrics make them unique, as does the fact that they are the only Celtic, Spanish rock band I've ever heard of. In this CD, as in previous ones not available in this country, the lyrics are insightful social commentary. I highly recommend this group."
1,Poor build quality on power jack,"While this product is quite easy to set up and seems to work fine in applications not requiring the power supply, it is completely unreliable when the power supply is needed. The connection between the power cord jack and the unit itself is such a poor fit that it comes loose just sitting on the desk. There is little point in buying a powered hub if the power can not be relied on. I can not recommend this unit and will be seeking to replace it."
1,"Gee, what brought you here?","I was tempted to give this CD a negative review based purely on the fact that some ""customers"" (uh huh. riiiight) recommended this CD ""in addition to/instead of,"" oh say, seemingly every indie rock album of the last five years. The annoying ubiquity of this album finally drove me to the point of giving it a listen (yet, thankfully, not purchase). This album might have been something were it not for the overproduction (too much tinkering), the headache-inducing arrangements (the nascent hooks are very nearly lost) and the laughably pretentious lyrics (""nevermore, nevermore, nevermore."" you got that right). Do yourself a favor... buy any of the other albums that invariably led you here."
1,dont be mislead,"i read the review of this. it prompted me to purchase the CD. this is poor, especially for a debut. do not be mislead"
3,Before John Gray became an idiot,"This book shows real insight into human emotion and interpersonal dynamics, presented in a very gentle, simple way. Why he gave up and became the gender stereotyper from hell, I don't know. I guess because it sold better. Too bad, because this is the better approach. He discusses the dynamics of emotional connection without resorting to ""men do this, women do that"" by showing that when one partner, regardless of gender, behaves a certain way, the other will respond accordingly.The tone of this book, again, is simple, almost childish, but gets the points across. ""The Two Step"", is the grown-up version."
2,not that great,The book was really childish and didnt help me at all. Its all big pictures and little useful information
5,Excellent,"A must read!!! It is written in a simple and ""fun"" format but with extremely profound principles."
3,A fun winter book!,"This book is like Cinderella because it has one mean mom and two mean sisters and Little Nell. One day Little Nell went to the woods and got her animal friends, and buillt a huge snowman. I like this book because it's cute and funny and has nice pictures. If you like to read winter books here is one. It's the best winter book you could ever see."
2,Not what I expected,I received this product 3/4 full as if someone was using it before I got. The scent was divine but I couldnt give it as a gift because it looked used
1,Not enough sticks and Bojeux could not care less,"Emailed (no response) and then called Bojeux because there were not enough sticks to complete the kit. Explained that even though the sticks were used efficiently, there were not enough. Bojeux said that that's impossible and I need to buy more sticks. Epically unsatisfactory response."
3,It was like they told,It was great... I order a newer book with expideted shiping. Guess what IT DID NOT ARRIVE. So this was a little damage in the cover arrive promptly and was my best choice. The book was in better conditions of what I expected.
1,Introductory? Says who?,"I bought this book a few weeks ago thinking that it will give me a good base to begin my first thermo course next year. I was so lost and confused by the book that I immediately sought help, and my tutor told me that I had completely wasted my money. If you are someone who has never done thermo before, like myself, save your money for something more useful: there is nothing introductory about this text. Try checking out Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach by Boles (a MUCH better introductory text-book)."
4,THERMO REVIEW,I AM JUST ABOUT TO COMPLETE AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE INTHERMODYNAMICS TAUGHT BY DR. ELLIOT. I THOUGHT THAT THIS BOOK REALLYMADE YOU WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS PROCESSES AND EQUATIONS. THAT IS A GOOD THING CONSIDERING THAT WE ARE NOT JUST LESSON LEARNERS BUT ENGINEERS. AND THAT BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT ARE ENGINEERS? THEY ARE PROBLEM SOLVERS THAT SHOULD NOT BE SPOON FED. IF YOU NEED TO BE SPOON FED ENGINEERING IS NOT FOR YOU. WHICH IS FINE. THE BOOK OVERALL HAD A GOOD PACE TO IT AND SHOWED A LOT OF SAMPLE PROBLEMS RELATED TO ACTUAL PROCESSES. OVERALL IT IS A GOOD REFERENCE BOOK THAT I WILL USE IN MY FUTURE CAREER I AM SURE.
3,Decent,"A decent introduction to Thermodynamics. Some very good examples, just not enough of them. The steam and property tables are very clear and user friendly. A little more explanation of some topics, especially the classical relations would help."
1,Student Review,"Having just completed Elliot's introductory thermodynamics course at the University of Akron with the pre-published version of this book, I would have to point out that several of the concepts introduced after chapter 4 are vaguely explained. I say this because several other books had to be used to gain a full understanding of the concepts. The example problems are another area of major concern throughout the entire book. The example problems often have several crucial steps skipped and offer a poor correlation between the homework problems at the end of the chapters. This is not to mention the numerous errors still found in the solutions of the sample problems."
2,Rather incomplete.,"I found this book to be rather unsatisfactory. I realize this is an APPLIED thermodynamics book intended for chemical engineers, but I still think it wholly incomprehensive. NOWHERE in the book is there even a sentence regarding the themodynamics of chemical reactions. Aren't chemical reactions important to the engineers performing them? Also, the majority of the mathematics behind all of the derivations is not included. Example: ""for a throttle, dH=0."" I realize this is somewhat intuitive, but mention could at least be made of the reasoning behind it, guys (and preferrably more than one paragraph)."
3,Makes you work!,"I think the text was pretty good; it made you consult references frequently, and that is a necessary skill to have as an engineer. As an engineer you have to know how to pick up theory and put it to use quickly. The problems were rough and time consuming, but that's because no problems in engineering are easy! When completed, though, you are satisfied. To the last guy: ""physics"" is the one major that can do anything! Everything in science is either physics or bug collecting, whether you like it or not :) But, engineering is more marketable."
3,Siempre Lucero,"I was very dissapointed with this CD. There is one song that is repeated twice. Song number 3 is supposed to be ""Se me Olvido otra vez"", which is one of my favorite songs, and instead of that song, they have ""Volver, Volver"", which is song number 10. I don't need to listen to the same song twice. They should be more careful reviewing their CD's before they release them."
2,"Better than LEFT BEHIND, but . . .","THE THIRD MILLENNIUM is better than the LEFT BEHIND series because it doesn't try to drag it out, but it's still a pretty poor attempt at depicting the end times of biblical prophecy. If you're looking for something that is incredibly exciting and biblically correct I recommend you take try THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY."
1,Truly terrible - don't waste your time.,"I was hoping for a story that might realistically portray the next coming of Christ, but this isn't it. The Third Millennium is poorly written and simplistic beyond belief. Like this - the (evil) President of the United States decrees that all citizens will now carry ID cards starting with the digits 666, because that is his favorite number. Right, I'm sure that's how it's going to happen. And when the Chinese man says ""ah so"" I almost threw the book away. (Note to the author: without even mentioning your stereotyping, ""ah so"" is Japanese, not Chinese, you moron). This book is an embarrassment. If you're looking for an excellent millenium/second coming story read ""The Last Day"" by Glenn Kleier (easily 5 STARS!)"
2,"A sincere, but bad book","I actually mostly agree with the person refered to as the ""idiot from Ohio."" This book is very bad literature. It is choppy and in many places contrived. Manuscripts like these give Christian fiction a bad name, because it is so far from reality. I'm not talking about the Biblical imagery, but rather the very unrealistic way the people relate to each other."
4,Great Book,"Although I felt the beginning was a tad long in explaining the characters, I liked this book very much. The story picks up a rapid pace just where it should, at the Rapture. I was so engrossed in the story at that point, that I finished it in two days by staying up until two in the morning until I finished it!"
4,Slow starter but good finisher!,"This is a good depiction of the end (or beginning). While it starts off quite slow by intoducing the players, scenery, etc. it begins to escelate near the middle of the book and ends up in a pretty good finale. A good first book for the new Christian. Confusing for a non-Christian as there are Biblical truths through-out."
2,Weak,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who have pointed out that this novel is simply not very good. With so many quality endtime novels that explore the concept in a superior way, it's become obvious that The Third Millenium is just a [copy] of Left Behind. Both We All Fall Down and the Christ Clone novels are far superior to this book"
3,Left Behind left this one Behind,An entertaining book but lacks the character depth of the left behind series. Was somewhat hard to finish. I was ready to move on but the end would just not come. You seem to loose contact with the characters in the last chapter.
1,"This was awful, just plain awful","This was, by far, the worst book I read in 1998. The plot holes were large enough to manuever a diesel locomotive through, the characters were worse than two-dimensional...they were transparent, and Meier's view of the world is appallingly skewed. Further, The dialogue was stilted and flat, the scenery was non-existant...the entire philosophy was never really explained. Meier apparently believed that his readers would come to see his point of view through sheer force of will. Anyone considering reading, let alone shelling out good, hard-earned American dollars for, this garbage should seriously reconsider."
1,Review of 3rd Millenium,"A wise man once said, ""each day we live we are one step closer to death"". The days that I spent torturing myself reading this drivel brought me 20 days closer to death. One part in particular stands out when the author chooses to ignore Revelations 10:10 and says, ""The judgement day willth riseth on the blood covered shores of Jeruselum and death be its name"". This is an obvious misprint for anyone who knows ANYTHING about the bible. Another horrible blunder by the author was to include a dog and cat as unlikely heroes of Christian soldiers. What the heck was that about!! I have never heard of anything so ridiculous. The one part that saved the entire book was where the doctor and his son went on a spirtual journey through Eden in their dreams. That was biblically accurate and had some real thought provoking moments. Overall, I wouldn't advise this book be read by anyone who seeks enlightenment."
2,"BAD, VERY BAD","This book had potential, but the terrible character developement and choppy flow of the book blew it. The end leaves you with more questions than the LEFT BEHIND SERIES books do!!!"
4,Educational of Bible truths,I read this book many years ago and lost my copy. I wanted to get it again and read it. It was the same effect! Loved it and checked bible references constantly and realize how close we are to the Messiah coming back!!
2,Not as good as expected.,"Because it was released directly to DVD, it allowed them to have nudity andlanguage that is really unnecessary. If you want to see a great movie, I recommendthe original RoadHouse with Patrick Swayze."
3,So terrible its good,This movie is so bad its good.like alot of people . I got pulled in by the name boy was i wroung. This is nothing like the first. The acting is awful . The story sucks . And there aint that many fights to begain with.it get to the point that even thou u want to turn it off u wont. Becouse u wanna to see how cheesey the ending .gonna be. So y did i give it three stars . Couse even thou its bad .itll do to kill time.buy if u must have both movies .if not skip it.
5,great,fast shiping and will buy again the best way to buy movies ... and it saves you money ........ thanks
3,Road House 2,"Very good action and Romance movie. There is really good action, plus a little romance at the same time."
2,Not even close to the original,You might enjoy this if you have not seen the original. On its own not to bad a story. If you compare to the original you will be disappointed. The quality of the video is also below the original.
2,Not Bad Enough To Be Good,This is not a horrible movie. Where it misses is where Roadhouse hit. The origional was so stupid and so goofey that it was actually hilarious in its 'badness'. This movie is just an ok straight to DVD movie.It is worth a watch if you might be a fan of the origional but it is hardly in its (the origionals) class. It is just not stupid enough.
1,1 Good ! 2 Bad !!,"Thanx For MUSIC Of James Otto. The Best Part Of The Flic. Watch It People James Is A RISSING STAR. James Otto Has 1 CD Out. ""Days Of Our Lives"" And It Is Worth Having In Your Stack!"
4,Not too much burn and a classic scent,"I expected this product to burn more than it did. Thankfully, it is nice and soothing on freshly shaved skin, plus it makes me smell like the old barber shop I used to go to. Good stuff and worth the purchase if you're getting other classic shaving implements."
3,Not what I wanted - pure cinnamon and cloves,"I tried this on a whim, only having tried a scant few bay-rum-scented items before. My basic experience with it has been that this aftershave is pure cinnamon-and-clove-scented alcohol. If you go open up a spice cabinet, sprinkle some cinnamon ground cloves in a jar and smell it, you'll get the same olfactory experience. The scent is very long-lasting, and a small amount will go a long way. If you are looking for this scent, you won't be disappointed with this product. However, if you're looking for something a little more subtle, I would look elsewhere."
3,it was ok,I like the spicey fragrance it was probably my third favorite out of them all would probably use this one again.
1,"More ""chemical"" than ""fragrance""","I had read the positive reviews on this product and decided to try it. Unfortunately, I immediately noticed that the smell whispered ""chemicals"" more than ""fragrance"". And it seemed rather weak and not very long lasting.I've tried several Bay Rum's. Some I liked. Some I didn't. ALL seemed to disappear too quickly. Is there ANY Bay Rum out there that truly has both the elegant quality and the lasting power of finer men's colognes? My search continues..."
1,Scentless,"This Bay Rum is almost scentless. I can't believe the reviews that say it is too strong. Tried it twice, then put something else on top of it."
5,Good old time after shave lotion.,This item is refreshing to your face after shaving. It has the smell of the old barber shops I remember from so long ago. I am glad to see that these bay rum after shaves are still available.
4,An old time aftershave,As a boy back home in central New York I recal the barbers using two Clubman bay rum products. I found this one at Amazon. It is exactly as I recall and a great old-time aftershave.
4,"I like it, wife likes it. what more do you need.","much cheaper than fancy cologne. Smells a lot like cloves and other spices. Wife says I smell good and you can't go wrong with that. Definitely not a lotion, more a pure aftershave. I still use my nivia lotion after a shave for moisture."
2,smells bad,not as good as the original product. but no were as bad as the vanilla that i bought.i dont recommend it.
4,LOVED THIS BOOK !!!!!,I can not say enough about this book.. I have read it several times and each time it gets better and better.. If you Love CHOCOLATE and ROMANCE then you will find this book to be a GREAT read.. The chacters in this book are so lively and the whole story is so upbeat.. It shows what a lot of determanation and a little love with the help of some Yummy Chocolate can do.. This book will always have a space on my shelf..
2,Not very thorough. Incomplete,"I bought the book believing that they would have something on tanning a buckskin hide and leaving the fur on. Well I was wrong, and disapointed, enough so to send the book back and take a loss. They had some historical information,and photos, some of which I enjoyed, but not all that helpfull for the task at hand. Another problem with the book was that the book is very disorganized. To find out some of the meanings you have to read closely, verses having a carefully listed content page that stears in the right direction. You can find just as much info by just doing a search on the web. The book has some helpful suggestions, and has some chemical gobbly gook if that interests you. I can only recommend this book if you are a fanatic on the subject."
2,Detailed Method For Buckskins,"The author took the complex task of making buckskins and makes it even harder by explaining the most minute details of the process. I was looking for more step by step detail on hide tanning. This book will be great for you if you really want every detail explained. I would have given this book 5 stars if it simply had an an appendix at the end of the book with step by step instructions of the process, but with much of the verbage removed."
5,Excellent book,"This book was well written, entertaining, and motivating. I'll definitely be tanning some hides this fall, and I plan to keep the book close as a reference. I appreciated the level of detail and the photos & drawings which answered all my questions about the tanning process. It also contained a healthy dose of humor to lighten things up a bit. I couldn't be happier with the book!"
5,Trading for time,Deerskins into buckskin will alow the reader to trade the time it takes to read this book for MANY YEARS of trial and eror. I have over 40 years exprience tannen hides if I would of only had this book back then. This book goes into great detail where so many get discourged and quit this will alow them to create a peice of history and art. If this book was more well known and avaiable we may be able to save many young minds. Helps build self confidence and brings out creativity. Loyd Arthur
4,"Good book, tough job","Using this fascinating book I managed to tan a few deerhides. None of them turned out perfectly, but they were close. The book is well written and enjoyable, but the actual work of turning deerskins into buckskins is a tough, tough job."
4,"Great classic movies, a bit disappointed in the quality -","Beautiful movies but the quality is better if you get them individually, especially with An American In Paris. I didn't mind the others :)"
5,expressway for quick learning,i am in awe of this book.it gives all the necessary and sufficient information needed.a must go through book.it cleared all my fundamentals.
3,A True Economist!,Hal Varian is a true economist: he has the ability to state the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible!
1,School books,"Text books are all lame. I buy them, but never read them.Save your money and go to class instead."
2,Okay,"I think this book is okay but as many reviewers have said the math is a little lacking. While math is important to economics, it isn't necessarily for the math's sake that that is so. Incorporating both the math and specific examples utilizing math really clarifies the theory. I found myself confused about what microeconomic theory meant when there wasn't a lot of numerical examples to back it up. There are far better text books to get a really thorough grasp of microeconomic theory, but if you already have that fundamental grasp I think this one might refresh your memory. But I would recommend others if you are looking to learn the theory for the first time."
2,Verbose,"I used this book for the Cornell Econ 301 course, a calculus based intro to microeconomics. The professor taught everything in lecture so that the book was used only as a supplement. I read part of the book and found that it is too verbose and repetitive. The author could have explained everything in less than half of the book. The exercises are not helpful. Moreover, this little book is sold for more than a 100 dollars. Not worth the money at all."
1,Dull Blossoms,"Apparently, the fact that the author/former journalist has spent many years in prison for killing a policeman, gives this book a pass, for the author's many supporters. Basically it's a thinly veiled manipulation to garner support for his appeals of his sentence. Some of the writing, such as a excrucriatingly long analogy of children and acorns, wouldn't ever see print without the author's notoriety, and ability for self-publicizing."
5,Blossums in Hell,"A book from Death Row. Would it be about bars, death chambers, law and lament I wondered as I took the book from the hands of my friend? No, he reassured me, this is a book about life. I laughed at the irony but began reading. I now wonder what kind of acid the justice system is on to silence and still the intellect, insight and the voice of this modern small-time profit. A book that should be on the stands everywhere. This is no 'for lefties only' publication.Tim Buchanen, Northern Ireland"
4,"Profound essays by a ""prisoner of conscience""","In this book, Mumia Abu-Jamal deals a lot with faith and religion. He talks about the hypocritical past of Christianity, the militancy of the Nation of Islam, and of his own faith (and the faith of many MOVE members): ""Life."" Mumia has managed to keep an optimistic view on life even though he has been on death row for over fifteen years.This book is of mostly one or two page essays concerning objectivity in the media, prison brutality, the outlook on life many death row prisoners have, faith, and his past. There is an excellent interview at the end of the book, conducted by the publisher. Whether or not you believe in the guilt of Mumia, this is a profound book that will provoke much thought and discussion."
4,A book of truth and of hope. No writer is objective.,"After watching the HBO documentary ""Mumia Abu-Jamal: A Case for Resonable Doubt?"", I came to believe that our government has sentenced to death an innocent man; so I attended a rally for his freedom in Philadelphia on April 27th and bought this book there. This book is not only about Mumia's life, but about all of our lives. None of our lives in America exist outside of the system. By not doing anything we passively concede to what our government decides to do for us. Either we're for it or against it. There is no middle ground. This book breathes of life and of freedom. It has opened my eyes wider than I had wanted them to open and has exposed the truth a little more. I wouldn't call this book an excellent piece of literature, but I would say that it's good because it gives life and hope in a dark and unjust world."
2,Pocket-sized disappointment,"When I saw this compact book on-line, I was thrilled with the prospect of having a handy PORTABLE cooking book to add to our Boy Scout Troop grub box.The size is just right, but there are very few recipes that typical boys would make. The cover shows a fish ... and recipes tend to that direction -- more 'elaborate' than most boys are interested in ... or often, have the TIME to make during camping events.I gave it to the Troop, but don't feel it was as useful as it could have been."
1,disappointed,I expected a more simplified version of a ccokbook with common ingredients found on a camping trip. This book may be better suited for an adult crowd with gourmet camp food in mind. I should have selected another book geared for families and kids.
5,Watch it again and again...,"This is a great video from a great teacher. If you like to explore a message from several arenas (video, audio, book) this is a great addition. Watch it again and again and hear something new every time!"
3,Interesting Protagonist,"Ehrengraf uses devious ways to win his clients' cases for them. So, is he a good lawyer or a bad lawyer? I enjoyed the stories, but after reading several of them, they all seemed the same. Even so, I'm still a Lawrence Block fan!"
4,"Nice quality, but its a bright red",The bracelet is well made but the leather was a brighter color red then i was expecting.
5,Excellent foundation for learning Jun Fan Gung Fu!,"Although I don't think someone can learn martial arts just from a book (as opposed to a qualified instructor), I believe this book comes pretty close as it gives great explanation of techniques and principles in laying the groundwork of Jun Fan Gung Fu. He discusses material in a progressive sequence starting with Footwork, and ending with the Five ways of attack in Jun Fan. Besides the very good pictures and good explanation of techniques and concepts, Kevin Seaman also provides excellent partner and solo training drills and tips so the student has ways to train the techniques presented in the book. Overall, if you are studying Jun Fan Gung Fu or Jeet Kune Do, or want to learn some good basic concepts to supplement your current training, I feel this book would be a great addition to your library."
5,Old School Classic,"The scene looks a little old in terms of what surrounds the road but at the same time, it's very close to what it is now so the buyer recognizes and appreciates what it is and at the same time what it was."
3,this is not as good as into deep,"I was expecting something phenomenal oviously. When I listened to this CD my expectations were made high by into Deep which I must commend as being truly innovative and a really succesful solo produce/mix album (actually probably the best).The Hive however aims at a more hard paced progressive sound and some seriously repetetive sounds, there are some good upliftingg melodic moments on this CD and it does cut the mustard in certain areas but as a mixed compilation of self produced work I have to say this floats the feather rather than dropping the hammer."
3,Beyond My Touch,The stories are segmented into parts. I really wished it was one novel itself--it would have been easier to read.
2,"Lightweight shed, not for robust use.","I was disappointed in how flimsy this shed really is. Despite the excellent assembly instructions It was very difficult to hold together while I was trying to assemble it. The floor is not rigid and the sides move easily, I had to buy racks for the inside because you can't lean anything against the sides. I have this shed under my deck so it's in a protected area. I wouldn't think of putting it out in the weather where strong winds would no doubt topple it. I would not purchase this product again."
3,Not half bad. 5+hours.,I got this as a Christmas gift because my girlfriend knows I like these kinda things. Not half bad. Decent stories but some are slow paced. Video quality is standard definition at 4x3 ratio. Just as it aired. You can get this pretty cheap used. Worth a look.
3,"Young James Brown, old TV productions","The 2 shows included in this package--Boston '68 and the Apollo in the same year--certainly capture James Brown at the top of his game. But both picture and sound leave something to be desired for both shows. Basically, these are DVD's taken from the old TV procuctions: the Apollo show images in particular make you feel like you're watching television in the 70's. The performances are good, althogh nothing comes close to Brown's performance in the '64 TAMI show. Having said all that, I'm especially glad to get to see the Boston performance--it contains some great moments. But you can save some money by buying just that single DVD. The triple DVD might be worthwhile if you're a hardcore James Brown fan, since it does include the Apollo TV show, which is after all, James in '68, in spite of the inferior production values. But if you haven't seen James full performance in the TAMI show, GIT ON IT!!"
4,I've been waiting for this,"I saw most of the great R'n'B performers of the '60's at Washington, DC's Howard Theater, but never got to see JB. I've been waiting for a performance DVD since the advent of video technology, and while this set has some production flaws , it more than fills the bill. Now, if they'll only release The TAMI Show on DVD...."
2,Product Review,"James Brown is my idol and I was really looking forward to sharing these with my uncle, however one of the disc was defective and the other two I already have. Really looking for older James Brown videos."
4,Hotness!!!!,"I love this disc set. James Brown is the bomb! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because some of the scenes are recorded with bad quality. Not bad enough to pass on though. I highly recommend this set if you really want to experience that James Brown ""Feelin""."
1,The Worst of the Worst,"I read about this DVD in the newspaper. It sounded like I would have the opportunity to view some of James Brown's great moves and singing. Instead, I received a barely visible DVD, the picture was taken from what appeared to be a great distance and was of very poor quality. On some parts of the video, the screen said, ""Video not available."" I thought this was supposed to be a DVD. The quality was so poor that I did not choose to waste my time viewing the whole set."
2,"MILDLY INTERESTING, NOT WORTH THE PRICE","James Brown will always be the godfather of Soul/Funk, the proof is in his classic 60's and 70's recordings. BUT as far as this dvd collection goes... DISC 1 / Blah Blah interviews, almost no music, just windbags like Al Sharpton blabbing away, don't bother - ZERO STARS. DISC 2 / Horrible sound, very distorted vocals, too bad. DISC 3 / The best disc here, but still the distortion on the vocals is tuff to take. Just get the CDs ...""Payback"", ""Jungle Groove"", and ""Hell"" to start."
2,Music only your (grand)mother could love,"I'm a huge fan of Al's mellow-but-mighty horn sound, but even he can't save most of the music on this album from fading into the wallpaper. There are some good tracks, but mostly it's just very blah. I guess 40 years ago these were hits, and I'm just barely old enough to even remember some of them. Al, as always, wrings the last drop from them, but some of them just don't contain much musical worth to begin with. If you've got all his other albums, or are curious as to what he'd do with some of these songs, as I was, buy it; otherwise, go for one of his better albums."
2,"Misleading, but still interesting.","From the book jacket, I expected Reluctant Assassin to be pieces of Booth's diary interspersed with a present-day mystery. I was disappointed to find that the present-day pages were unnecesary filler. There was also no discernible plot in the present-day and journal chapters. Everything Booth did was interesting, and it was funny to see that, like Forrest Gump, he was involved in some way with many famous people. However, there was no goal he was trying to achieve or mystery he was trying to solve. It was just a diary. I wouldn't have picked up this book if I had known what it was about. It was a quick, easy read, so at least it didn't get boring."
5,I loved it!,"The Forrest Gump scenario is applied to John Wilkes Booth in this really entertaining book. Booth interacts with significant characters of the era giving insight into himself and Mark Twain, Wyatt Earp, Noel Coward, and assorted others. The Post Civil War era of the West is brought into clear focus through the complex mind of a misunderstood villain. I loved it!"
4,Flex Grill Basket,"It is a great tool for grilling fish -- without the usual loss factor. The flexible basket wiring contours to whatever it is you are cooking on the barbque. Makes flipping fish really easy. Large -- it can hold up to 4 lbs of fish. Other reviews mentioned the sticking problem, but all you have to do is spray olive oil on the wiring and it should not stick.The one negative part is cleaning the basket. We recommend soaking it after usage in hot water and dishsoap. But you still have to scrub it to get the food off."
4,Good one,I liked the way veggies are held in place even when overloading. The clean-up is very easy with the stainless steel wire construction. I'm buying more for gifts!
3,Good grill tool--a devil to clean,"This is a very innovative grill tool. I like the way the two basket pieces flex with the thickness of the meat. It's also well made, often a rarity these days. Especially good with fish, which seem to stick or fall into pieces and drop into the fire regardless of what you do. The downside is that it is a real chore to clean. Instructions are specific not to put it in the dishwasher, which I was aware of before placing the order. Reality is that after enjoying a nice grilled dinner + a couple of adult beverages, who wants to face cleaning a grill basket with burned on fat?"
2,"Don't bother, unless you like to scrub for hours...","We purchased this (not from Amazon) to grill fish on our Big Green Egg Grill. The fish grilled fine, but stuck to all the little wires (we were grilling whole fish). When done, the mess was incredible. My husband soaked it for over an hour and it was impossible to clean. We finally gave up after a ridiculous amount of time working on it and it ended up in the trash.So buyer beware--if food sticks to it, you'll either scrub for hours or it becomes disposable. We're still on the search for a good fish grilling basket. P.S. The folks over at Cooks Illustrated apparently have had the same frustration with grilling baskets and have developed their own, low tech method of grilling fish without a basket. We'll be trying that next."
5,Excellent analysis,"Scheuer's book is a gem, a worthy companion to Mander's Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television and Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death. His taxonomy of how television mediates reality -- especially political reality -- is informed and thorough and should become the locus classicus on the subject. And his reflections on how the structure of television reality undercuts an open and organic view of society deserve a wide audience. To boot, the writing is clear, witty, evenhanded -- a good read."
2,"Too bulky, rubs my sound hole edge upon insertion","I bought this for my Jose Ramirez S1 based on another JR owners' review. It would be better if the device were a 1/4"" thinner. Upon installing you must lift away one of the outer 'E' strings to squeeze in the device between the string and the rim of the sound hole. It is bulky and that makes it difficult to avoid rubbing it against the sound hole rim. I hate doing that. My sound hole measures 4-3/8"" in diameter. If your sound hole is 3/8"" to 1/2"" greater in diameter then squeezing might not be an issue.Does it work? Yes, brought up the humidity in the sound hole area 10%-15%. I suggest upon recharging you shake it out, the excess liquid is hard to notice and can drip excess inside the guitar."
1,Not for all dogs,"It's hard to know in advance whether a video will engage a dog. This one didn't work for Chloe, primarily because only the first segment features dogs. The other segments feature squirrels, ducks, hamsters, and other wildlife. Even the dog segment was a bit off the mark (features monkeys dressed like cowboys riding dogs to herd sheep). If I buy another such video, I'll try to ascertain that it's 100 percent dog-content."
3,where is it?,I bought this because they were featured on a movie and thought they sounded different. Well... After the shipping date got pushed back for the third time i gave up and canceled. Ill find it on Itunes or something
4,Good and handy references,"It is a good and handy references for finding different tools on problem solving and project completion for a busy business man. This is not a book to read, but a book for search.Everytime, you search it and the treasure will be here."
4,"Beautiful music, romance and troubled times in one's life.","A wonderfully written story about a Spanish painter, Francesco Goya,and his viewpoint of life during the Spanish Inquisition, and his obsession with an intriguing and beautiful woman, the Countess of Alba. This is a movie worth seeing. It tells of life during the inquisition , of trying to stay in favor with the courts and also keep their social standing even when associating with the common people. Beautiful Spanish music makes you feel as if you are there. This movie has a combination of love and romance, jealousy, hatred and death and combined together makes a very good story. Anthony Franciosa and Ava Gardner were very believable in their portrail of these characters. They draw you into the story and make you feel as if you are a part of it all."
2,Not as advertised !!,"Beware!! The ad for this pole says 3 in 1 and indicates that the pole comes with three different tips included: a grommet tip, a snap tip and a rubber tip. Even the OEM packaging says that three tips are included and my OEM package was undamaged and untampered with. There were however no additional tips included. The pole ONLY comes with the rubber tip pictured. Useless for me since I need the grommet tip as most boat covers do."
4,Great deal on headset among myriad of choices,"CON: There is a little bit of distortion at higher volume, and it took a little work to adjust along the 6 settingsPRO: good quality+price, I am pleased to say this headset works well.Other reviews are right you need to follow setup directions-- plug it into the handset and you pickup and hangup using the handset."
4,So much better,"I bought 2 of these for our office. We love them because we make a lot of calls every day and it is So much better than using the handset. I like that there are volume and mute controls right on the base. Also it is easy to switch between the handset and headset. The sound is clear and the ear piece is very comfortable. The only upgrade I would have liked is a way to easily connect/disconnect the headset to the base - I would leave my headpiece on my head all the time - but when I need to get up from my desk I have to take it all the way off - it would be nice to just ""disconnect"" it. Overall Great Investment!"
2,Nice when they work,"I have had two of these phones now. Each has been comfortable and functional. Both have died within a year. The headset is fine, but the telephone stops working. The buttons stop functioning. You can get a refurb off warranty for $35 but it is only good for a year or less.Would be a great product if it lasted."
4,Love it,"As a customer service representative, comfort and sound/mic quality are very important. This headset exceeds my expectations so far. I did purchase a used unit so setup was a challenge, but after visiting Plantronics webpage I found instructions for this unit. By following these instructions, I was ready to take calls in minutes. I do recommend after initial setup that you use it to both place a call and to recieve a call so you can adjust volume settings and become familiar with the headset's operation with your phone. All in all, Plantronics is the only brand I'll trust."
3,head set,"Recieved this in excellent condition, but microphone was too weak to be heard. Have to get new microphone put in head set."
1,Very Low Quality Item,I was expecting that a fifty dollar headset would be high quality. I was mistaken.The first S11 headset system I received wasn't fully assembled. The earphone was hanging from the headset by the two tiny speaker wires. The headset didn't work at all. Thinking that maybe I had gotten a rare lemon I requested a replacement.The replacement arrived and it had parts rattling inside of the earphone. Upon plugging it in the sound and voice quality were horrible. I followed the instructions to configure the device but no combination of settings resolved the sound and voice quality problems. I returned this headset for a refund.My experience with the two S11 headsets has been frustrating. For two out of two sets to be defective indicates a generalized lack of quality from the brand. I recommend you avoid the S11 headset and find something else.
2,Not what i needed,"It was ok, but the headset came off leaving the wires exposed. And the mute button did not work. Very disappointed."
3,"Not bad but, not great.","I bought the Plantronics S11 Headset System for my work at home job. Easy to install if you follow the instructions. The amplifier seems to be fine but, the headset is crap. The earpiece pops regularly and the mic has a lot of static. I will probably upgrade the headset and I imagine I will be happier."
3,You get what you pay for,"I needed something cheap and quick while starting my home business. So I really got both, that is why I am giving this product 3 stars. The headset is very fickle and can be very uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Also I would suggest paying the extra dollars to find a headset that has a keypad accessory. Please don't make the mistake that I did and assume that finding a phone that has an extra jack port to connect this headset to is easy to find under $40. Because in my experience it was not. Thankfully I found a used phone at the last minute at a Thrift store for 4.99. Overall.... I am able to get by until I can find something better in the future."
3,I would like to give this a higher rating but it has one major flaw.,"The sound quality, ease of use and comfort of the headset are all superb. For it's price this unit would be a good value.Except that the headset doesn't comfortably fit onto the headset rest. It falls down all the time. The width of the band that goes over your head is larger than the width of the wire loop it's supposed to rest in and the wire holder isn't tall enough so that instead of hanging, the headset is resting on the unit itself. What a huge flaw and so easily avoidable.It plugs in with a mini phone jack so the headset could be replaced easily enough. Which I guess I'll do as soon as this one breaks which won't be long as I've had the unit for a week and it's fallen to the floor 3 times already."
2,Doesn't Work With Phone,I ordered these for our remote employees but we purchased the wrong phones for our employees. The S11 will not work well with the phones we purchased. The one employee who could get it to work say that the headset is very uncomfortable and that a client complained that they could barely hear him on the phone in spite of the built-in amplifier. Will probably be returning these headsets.
4,Good Headseat,"Good sound quality, easy to hook up and use as long as you read the instructions. Volume is good, almost too loud on with my phone. Headset is comfortable. Would like it if the cord between the phone and the base unit were a little longer and the headset cord for me would be better if it were about a foot longer. That would allow more flexible placement of the base. Still for the price I can't complain."
3,Low Volume,"I really like the headset; however, people have complained of me being really quiet when the volume for ""speak"" is at max.Also, the headset rest does not work; I cannot get it to stay ""hung up""."
1,Doesn't Work With Many Phones,"Bought the thing, need to return it--only found out after buying that it doesn't work with my phone! I have a ATT 2 line office phone for my home office, but turns out these don't work with those. Check first!"
1,This is a problem item,It came and I attempted to connect it. The only trouble is that it is apparently designed for very new telephone lines and not for those more than a couple of years old. I couldn't get the lines to connect because my plugs were just a fraction bigger than the holes provided.Amazon was very nice about letting me send it back.
3,Office Staple,"We have 11 of these and they really get a work out every day. We have almost no problems with these, replacement of one headset. Worth the price."
2,Not worth the money I paid for it!,I did purchase this headset over a year ago and it instantly started cracking and I had to resort to using tape because I work from home and couldn't afford to lose time and money trying to wait for another headset to be delivered and now it is completely trash. I guess what angers me about the whole situation is how it broke when I first got it and that I barely used it since work had been scarce for me. I cannot remember what company it came from but I bought one on here that was used that held up so much better and it was used! I need to know if there is a way I can just buy a headset instead of replacing the entire phone the base is perfectly fine! I will send Plantronics an email to see!
2,It's toreable,it's tolerable. I don't look forward to using it and am glad when the call is over. I feel as though i have a sea shell against my ear.
2,Disappointed,The volume controls didn't work; the mute button didn't work. The only thing the headset did was to transfer the sound from the phone to the headset ear piece. That's it.
3,Consider the S12,If you are trying to decide between the s11 and the s12 my advice would be to get the S12-It's worth the extra money. There is no hum in the background and the sound quality is better. At times using the S11 it is difficult to hear the speaker/caller on the phone call.
4,best investment,I love my headset. It has helped me with my job as a telemarketer 100%.The clarity of the headset is amazing. The noise canceling feature is great. The people only hear me and not what is going on around me. I work in a call center with 40 other people and it is great to have the piece ofmind knowing that the person I am talking to can hear only me and understand every word I am saying. I would recommend this product to anyone that spends their day talking on the phone.
5,Great product - well designed,"These phones are an excellent choice. Read the above features for all the normal stuff.The phones work great. Unusual items of interest:1) The phones SHARE a phone book. This is very cool. If you are using the second handset, and you have typed all the numbers into the first handset, they will all be there.2) The phones use standard size NimH batteries. This should make it very easy to replace them when they wear out (a common cordless phone problem).Downsides: Only supports the 2 handsets it comes with.I am very happy with my purchase."
5,"VTech 5.8GHz, a great bargain","I've owned two VTech phones, this one being my second--and I've had this new 5.8GHz model for a couple of weeks now. I am very satisified with the reception, clarity, ease of use, and give this product a full, 5 stars. The speakerphone is even much clearer than I have heard on other, comparable, phones. For the price, you surely cannot find a better deal?"
3,Lasted just under two years,"The phones worked just fine, very easy to use, no interferences with our wi-fi. We bought them less than two years ago, and around two months ago both phones needed a new battery, first the one we use the most and then about three or four days later, the other one, which we don't use much. After replacing the batteries, the display started to fail, one line at a time. Now it's to the point where one of the phone's display is completely unreadable, and the other one is only somewhat readable in the first line. We were pretty happy with them, and we have given them good use, but it just seems like they are somehow programmed to last a couple of years."
1,Chek Battery problem!!!!,"The extra handset has had the same problem that I see reported in numerous other reviews of this product. You have to remove one battery, replace it, and then the handset may work for a few days or as little as a few hours. I called VTECh and they said to replace the batteries. They must be aware of this problem and yet they were dishonest. I replaced the batteries with nickel hydride and I get the same problem. So now I am out the price of the batteries (around $15) because VTECH was not forthcoming. I will never purchase a VTECH phone again!!!!!!"
4,Very good phone,"I would have rated 5 stars except for the fact that the ""message waiting"" light keeps coming on. I have it connected to my Vonage line where I do not use the voicemail feature and I don't know why it keeps coming on.Otherwise, good phone."
1,VTech ip 5825 - Not a good long term buy - Battery problems,"This VTech phone is not a good buy in the long run. There are some rave reviews onlines for this phone, but the battery problem starts in first few months. Messages like ""CHECK BATTERY"", ""PLACE IN CHARGER"" etc start displaying even though you have placed the phone in charger for more than 8hrs.The call center representative told me get a new battery, as though I didn't know that answer.Will never buy VTech products. Bye bye VTech.regards,Shailesh"
1,Check Battery ????,"Just like a lot of other users, after 1 year of good services, one of the phone won't charge anymore. The message ""check battery"" is displayed. How many users will have to contact VTech before they actually act on this reccurent problem ????"
1,Batteries Won't Charge,"After about two months both units started displaying the now infamous Vtech battery error message. We discovered, like a lot of other reviewers, that if you move the batteries, or take the batteries out of the phone it will cause the phone to work properly for a day or two. Who really wants to do that?""Honey, did you remember to take the batteries out of the phone and put them back in so we can use it again?""Also, the phones, bases, and AC adapters, get very hot charging.I ordered two new GE phones that I found here on Amazon to replace these worthless Vtech junk phones...in the trash they go!The Vtech battery problem is very well known so I don't understand why companies are still allowed to sell them. There is no excuse."
1,Battery Trouble,Same as many others. Until eight months all was fine and good and then check battery warnings started. Take out the batteries and put them back problem solved. Sometimes it would be nice to make a call without doing this though! Too expensive to replace batteries compared to price of phone and others have mentioned this does not solve the issue anyway. Not expandable either. Should have kept the receipt. Live and learn.
3,3 stars for value,"Pros:inexpensive (relatively speaking)clear reception (very good)phonebook featurepaging featureCons:Lightweight almost to the point of questionable constructionI would not buy this again, instead, I would buy another GE, which we've had good luck with, or maybe try panasonic. Our Motorola has poor reception and two ATT phones only lasted 3-4 months."
1,NO Quality Control,"I purchased two pairs of these phones. They worked great for four weeks before developing a series of recurring problems. In some cases the phone would click and chirp when you tried to establish a dial tone. Other times they would not ring for an incoming call. We tried everything before returning them to VTECH four weeks ago. Of course, VTECH has not bothered to respond, send a replacement, etc. This is very disappointing since we really loved the last generation of VTECH 2625 phones. BEWARE-- this phone is useless junk."
2,Vtech Cordless phones,"The phones didn't even last a year-the batteries started losing their charge/not charging. And even if they did manage to charge, they did not have a very long use time/talk time. We thought about replacing the batteries, however it was cheaper in the long run to get new phones-this time we went with Uniden and have been happy with them."
4,Very Convenient!,"Having dual handsets around the house is very convenient. They have been awesome during use. Battery life leaves something to be desired, as you can only leave them off the base a day before they die--good thing you have another to use! Also, the phonebook and caller ID are shared between phones, cool feature, but sometimes you have to try a couple times before it can pull the info from the base to the handset... you get a ""Not available at this time"" message."
3,Well 1 out of 2 isn't terrible,Got this set with 2 handsets. One handset says put on charger.. I purchased another battery and it still says put on charger. The phone is defunct. I have 0 issues with the other phone so maybe it's a fluke. Hope so.
5,Nice phone- recommended.,"I own older (900mhz) v-tech phones. They are still in use. So far these phones have exceeded my expectations. I have used them outside over 100 feet from the base and they are crystal clear. I agree with other reviewers that the volume adjustment is annoying, but a minor inconvenience. The phone book is extremely versatile; you can easily move phone numbers from the stored caller id list directly in to the phone book. No more manually typing in those numbers!"
2,Not Recommended,"We purchased the 5825 about a year ago. I will note that in general, the phone worked, with a few inconveniencies. Editing numbers in the phone book was a pain - to add a ""1"" or an area code to a saved number means deleting the whole number and starting over. However, since the handsets 'share' the phone book, the editing needed to only be done once. Still, competing phones have a much easier add/edit feature.After about a year, however, the handsets would not hold a charge. Logically, we replaced the batteries. The new batteries charged three days. The phones only display a 'searching' message, and annoyingly BEEP every 10 minutes or so.We cannot recommend this phone."
1,0 stars - Battery issues,"As you'll see from other reviewers, there is definitely a battery issue here. There should be a lemon law in effect for this - time to look for consumer protection laws against this product."
1,Battery problems,"When it works, it's mediocre. Unfortunately it doesn't work all that often. I had battery problems a month or two after purchase. Pass on this one, folks."
3,No Caller ID Redial???,I have/had a slightly older model VTech and LOVED IT!!!! This phone has great quality sound but a bit of inconvience with it. My old phone had a nice feature that if someone called you on the caller ID and you wanted to return their call all you had to do was dial 1 then scroll to find their number in the caller ID log and then ON. This phone does not allow you to do that. I find it quite frustrating. I was so used to using that function. So I was quite disappointed. I am in the process of retraining myself now. I actually have to remember numbers!!!!
3,Great for the first 8 months,"This phone worked great with great sound for the first 8 months. Suddenly both handsets stopped taking a charge. No big deal, just replace the batteries. That worked for the main phone but the extra handset will not charge, either in the additional charger or the main charger. Haven't tracked down the problem but will keep trying."
1,Batteries wear out after a year,"I first bought this phone two years ago and after about a year the phone started giving me the message ""Warning, check battery."" I called V-Tech and they told me to make sure the phone was charged, which it was. We hang both phones up every night and they are charged at least 8 hours a day. Then the other handset started giving the same message. I looked into replacing the rechargeable batteries but found they were very expensive - not worth it for what I paid for the phone. To V-Tech's credit they sent me a brand-new phone - same model - about a year ago. Just last week the new phone started giving me the same message. I have always loved the V-tech phone and owned another one prior to this for about 5 years. I am sorely disappointed with this model and don't think I'll be buying another V-Tech now that I'm in the market - again."
2,Battery issues,"This is amazing. I got on Amazon to see if I could buy some additional remote bases for this phone and immediately see the reviews about the same issues I have and have been putting up with because I think we get used to electronic products working poorly. I have the same battery issue and the handset in the main base does get very warm. Nevermind additional handsets, I am just going to buy a different phone. Sounds like a consumer class action is in order!"
2,Where's Steve?,"The sound quality of this CD isn't the greatest, but it's certainly a step up from the terrible series of ""official bootlegs"" that the new Asia have put out. One of the big selling points of this CD is that it features original Asia member and certified guitar hero, Steve Howe as a special guest. Steve appears on only a few tracks at the end. He might as well have not been included, his quitar playing is barely audible in the mix. Do not buy this CD if you are expecting some great playing by Howe! Only buy it if you are a fan of the new Asia and must have a complete collection. John Payne does an adequate job in the vocal department. The CD does rock at some points and has it's moments, but is certainly not a ""must have""."
3,Nice but,pretty strong smelling - doesn't seem like the light fragrance of a true natural scent - smells sort of like cherry to me - I wanted something totally natural and - it just didn't seem like the description - the oatmeal was scarce which was suppose to be sticking up like a scrub - I didn't see it - just didn't seem like a natural soap to melooking for something I can use on delicate skin without irritation - probably need to go back to Reviva soap which is truly natural for sensitive skin
2,"No animal testing, but made from animals.","Yardley makes a big deal about how they do not test on animals, but the main ingredient in their soaps is sodium tallowate. This is derived from ANIMAL FAT. So, they may not wash animals with their soap, but their soap is made from dead animals. Before I discovered this, I was very happy with Yardley's soap, because it smells very nice, and doesn't leave the waxy residue that soaps made from petroleum byproducts leave. I wanted a natural soap, but I did not want to bathe in the fat of dead creatures. I know many people aren't fussed by this, but just in case you didn't know (especially since yardley comes up if you search for ""vegan soap"" - now you do."
4,Excellent,The best thing about this soap is the scent. I just love it. Note: meant to rate with 5 stars.
4,Strong Hailey,"""Strong Medicine"" may be the best Hailey novel of all. The characterizations are believable throughout. This applies to all of the Jordans, plus Vincent Lord, Noah Townsend, Gideon Mace, Senator Donahue, and many others. A vast improvement over earlier works such as ""Wheels"" and ""The Moneychangers""."
1,never received,"I never recieved this item as the shipper ""claims"" item was returned undeliverable and still charged the 2.50 shipping cost on a 3.99 item?? I wote Clearly charming with my disatisfaction and was still charged. Buy your charms somwewhere else. My rating for clearly UN Charming is Zero Stars"
1,Misleading Title! No Photography Activities!,"I was very disappointed with this book. There are no photography activities in the book. The book mentions different aspects of an image: mood, angle, etc."
3,B Movie At It's Best,"I've read the other reviews and I don't get it. This is a very, very bad ""B"" movie, complete with bad acting, (watch for the Bo's 'agonized' scream when she is given the urn containing Johnny's ashes), bad editing, and more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. It is, therefore, hilarious. For those of you who love silly, bad ""B"" movies, rent it and have a good laugh. For Gods sake, don't waste your money buying it."
2,Funny comedy of manners but not really a Stephane Rideau movie,"This is a typically good comedy of errors and manners the French do well, but be warned if you're looking to add to your Stéphane Rideau collection, he is only in two scenes, as a policeman, and not on the screen for more than two minutes. But still, if you're a big Rideau fan, he is in this movie if only for those two minutes and should be in your collection."
3,"Bad sound, good music","For real Hawkwind fans, a real historic occasion, for collectors. If you're not a collector/Hawkfan the sound is so bad that it's not worth listening to. I mean, it is funny when someone comes up to the person recording it (probably on a small tape recorder) and asks him for Rizzlas, and says 'Great concert mate' but it is not what I call a good recording. There are much better recordings of these great songs!"
1,mud,"I agree with what the other folks are saying about this one. great tunes, dreadful sound. not worth buying at all. the crowd conversations are much louder than the band! avoid this one!"
3,Running Short Review,"These running shorts are OK. I was disappointed they were not more generously proportioned for being extra large. I am size 14 - 16 and I like running shorts to be loose and these are not. They are nice light material and wash up well, but I would like them better if they were more roomy. Remember to buy a size or more larger than usual if possible."
2,pretentious gibberish,"This is probably one of the most overated 'works of art' films that I have ever seen. It's pretentious gibberish repeated over and over again. Boresome, repetitious, meaningless, and slowgoing.I appreciate Brakhage and what he's done (insignificant, repetitious, overated 'works of art'), I just personally get very little out of it."
1,tedious experimentalism,"I'm really trying to see the value in these films. There's obviously no narrative, so the films would have to rely on beauty of composition. Sadly, there is none of that. These films never coalesce into a whole greater than the sum of their parts. Mothlight, for instance, never achieves its intended effect and remains merely something akin to a cat's vomit after swallowing a bug--placed on fim stock."
5,Brakhage is a genius,"Finally we have a beautiful and deserved collection of works from one of the most influential and original post-war cinematic artists. I will not describe what type of films Brakhage made, since you must see them to comprehend, but know this: Along with Kenneth Anger, Maya Deren, Jack Smith & Jonas Mekas; Brakhage was one of the all-time great avante-garde filmmakers so if you are at all interested in avante-garde, underground & experimental films, Brakhage is one of the best. This entire DVD package is worth the price alone for ""Window Water Baby Moving"", a 12-minute short that's Brakhage's treatment of the birth of his daughter. The result is so full or primitive wonder & love, so far beyond civilization in its acceptance, that it becomes like an experience like few in the history of the movies."
1,"Not the ""original Air Chair""","Don't be tricked, this is an inferior most likely far east built knock-off. You get what you pay for.Beware!"
4,Good Value,"The item is fun. We hung two in the screen room and two under the deck. It's a little too ""ropey"". The ""foot sling"" tends to squeeze together and become uncomfortable on one's ankles. The cup holder is a bit strange to hang and never seems to be at a convenient height, but the chair itself is very comfy and a deal for the money. The only other objection I have is that the instructions are vague and there is NO indication of the weight limit. (You can get that info on Amazon - 250# limit). Choose a VERY sturdy eye hook to hang it."
2,"Looks good, but--ouch!","Got my two hammocks and am STILL trying to put one together!!! I read the previous reviews--I figured if the guy who loved it AFTER he put it together was sharp enough to figure it out without directions, I could. Ha. It looks easy enough, but those knots and ties are aggravating! Maybe I'll change my mind IF I ever get the thing together--meantime--I'm hatin' it. Oh, the red and black coloring is very GA Bulldogs :)"
4,"Mmmmm, cinnamon.","The cinnamon chip refill was slow to arrive. The product appears relatively fresh. It smells wonderful when ground and has a nice cinnamon taste. But you do have to get pretty close to it to smell it. Considering the cost of shipping such a small light weight item, I was dissappointed that it took so long to get here. Still, I bought it to topp off my cappuccino and it serves it's purpose well. It's also an item I've had a hard time finding, so I hope the seller continues to make it available."
5,Great Grooming Aid - and Made in the USA!,"My first Magna Lite 5x magnifier was purchased from an office supply store in the mid 90's. After all of these years of daily use, it finally died last week. In record shipping time, I received its replacement yesterday.In addition to all of the uses suggested on the packaging, I have found this to be the IDEAL grooming aid (especially for that errant eyebrow and nose hair).The Magna Lite Illuminated Hand Magnifier 5x isn't frilly and isn't fancy. It's a magnifer, with a light. It does exactly what it was designed to do - and does it very well!!!"
4,Works for my application,I ordered the 5x and 10x to do initial looks at cracks in materials. It works as expected.
5,The Rejectionist was Barak the Failure was of Clinton&Arafat,"Kimmerling and Migdal in the part four of their book provide the readers for the first time the true and non-biased story behind the failure of Oslo-Taba talks, within a wide historical perspective. It is a must be reading for every person who want to understanding the reasons of the recent development between the Israelis and the Palestinians. A scholarship at its best."
3,ok game,"I'll make this short. Hard and boring in the begining, but does get better the farther you get. Wierd controls for jack, you have to touch the screen to look around which tires your thumb and scratches the screen. Bad graphics. Overall: good game, but if I were you I would'nt waste my money on it."
2,*##**Brief Review of King King**##*,"I have to admit it was the one of the worst video games I have ever played. The only reason it got two stars was 'cause of the graphics. If you want graphics, go watch a Star Wars movie!First of all, you don't even get to be King Kong and kill all the people. You have to be that stupid Peter Jackson, who doesn't have a gun or a knife and can't even punch. It has an unrealistic price. If you want a good DS game, I advise you to get Mario Cart DS. In other words, DON'T BUY KING KONG DS (but the movie is great)!-the pwnzor"
1,MORE LIKE KING SUCK!!!!!!,"grahpics-2/5,the highest point of the game!controls-1/5,very confusing and unearthly hard.story-1/5,no meaning,no feeling.overall-1/5,hard,very hard and very boringNOT RECOMENDED(you want a good portable version,try the PSP edition!!!!!)"
4,Lowrider Oldies 4,I enjoyed the oldies for easy listening music. Good easy music. I would recommend this CD to anyone that want to hear a variety of smooth music.
5,convert-a-bench,"Love them. They seem very sturdy. They are perfect for us at our summer place, we can use them as benches around the campfire and then be made into a picnic table for meal time. Very versatile. I was really please by how soon they arrived also."
5,Wonderful,I ordered 2 benches to make a picnic table. They are lightweight and easily movable for a picnic. They are easily transformed from a bench to a half picnic table with just a flip. Exactly what I wanted!
5,BENCH /TABLE,"I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. MADE OF HIGH QUALITY PLASTIC, MAKES WONDERFUL BENCHES AND THEN CAN CONVERT TO A TABLE"
5,Made in the USA!!! Love this Convert a Bench,I only ordered one to see if I would like it. I love it. I will prob order another one. It was easy to put together and very comfy.I would def recommend it.
3,Interesting but incomplete,"I found this book interesting but the contents seem a bit disorganizated and publication quality is sub-standard. It's inexpensive, so it's probably worth the price. However, it lacks practical advice and other travel information not related to churches and monuments."
1,Additional Garbage,"This product is futher reason why the PSP is a failed system for anything, but video games (that is unless you have a playstation 2 were the games cost at least $10 less I would't bother) The video transfer is useless unless you already have an encoder program on your computer. The files once bragged and dropped are put in to it's own filing system not yours. If you want to organize your photos for get it. If you think you can create your own musical playlist anyway you want think again.The Media Manager is is less like a helpful employee and more like a tyrant boss complete with whip.I usually like Sony products, but the PSP is a money pit and this is just one of the snakes at the bottom."
1,"Great, another MEG","Well, just when you thought it was safe to go to the bookstore, another laughable novel about a giant man-eating shark. Definitly a wannabe, if not incoherant copy of Jaws. When will this ""Megaladon lives!"" kick be over?"
1,Didn't fit 2001 BMW 530i,"Fitment guide said it fits 2001 BMW 530i, but the plug turned out to be wrong. A trip to the local stereo shop and $20 solved the issue with correct part number 40-EU10, which Metra website lists as 2003 530i application. Now I'm stuck with this adapter as a paper weight."
2,2000 Buick Lesabre,"Be cautious when ordering this cable for a 2000 Buick Lesabre. Even though the manufacturers web site (and all other sources) say it will fit, it did not for me. My car was built 02/2000 and it still had the old 1999 antenna connector behind the HU. At least in my specific case, a 40-GM10 adapter was needed.Visual quality of the adapter was good, but in lieu of actually testing it, I have to give it a poor rating due to inaccurate data supporting the use of it."
3,OK,"Fear Me is a typical dark horror novel that doesn't shy away from pain, death, or red stuff. Characters aren't too grating and I can understand their motivations, and the ending is anything but wimpy. Still, Fear Me lacks some luster by not standing out enough, using a quick enough pace to stay interesting but not riveting. The villain isn't explored too deeply and just comes across as cruel - which, for this type of book, is good - but I couldn't care less about his fate either. Mild cheesiness during moments brought it down more points. A book worth reading but not seeking out."
2,moment,This is a disappoint novel about a vampire seekingvengeance against three women. There are just twomany characters in this novel which slows the pace ofthe plot. Also there are too many unanswered questionsabout the vampire. The story has it moments but they're few.
2,"Lesson # 1. ""Do not trust Customer Reviews""",I am a big fan of Italian music. Never heard of Laura Pausini before but Customer Reviews were favourable so I gave it a shot. Disappointment! Mediocre voice and very mediocre songs. I could not single out one memorable number. A few cute pictures of her inside though...
2,Boring game,"I don't recommend that game for anyone, unless they have money to burn. Army men 2 Sarge's Heros is a vehiclar combat game. Sounds cool, huh? The game has 9 differents vehicules to control. Sounds very cool,huh? The first mission is quite cool, you destroy all the enemies on the map then you go to the second level after noting the password. The second level is the same, destroy all the enemies. You become bored very very fast, especially when the vehicles are the same exept for their speed. What got me very very very bored is the boat stage. The stage is huge and your boat moves at such a slow pace and you need to explore all the level and it takes a lot of time... You get the idea..."
4,Very Cool Game-But.,"Lets start with the pros. You get to drive in tanks, motorcycles, boats and more. You also get to pick who you want to be. The conns are that you dont get to walk in the game.The graphics also need improvement, but it's still a good game. It's a 4 star game."
2,Not pleased,"This game is hard to control, very slow moving and very DARK. I tried putting in new batteries, standing in lots of lighting and even using a worm light, and it's still very hard to see anything. I would not recommend this game."
3,I had no idea that there was such thing as a bad Army men game...,"...Untill now.I bought this game because we were going on vacation.Now do not get me wrong,I am not one of those Army men haters, in fact I looooooove Army men I am buying all of them.But I was soooo surprised to find that this one was a joke.The story line is constantly changing,You can not be sarge,The guys you play as do not even relize that they are fighting tans untill like the 7th or 9th level.The gameplay graphics are so so but the comic book-like are actually pretty good.All the sound effects stink exept the sound the tan rifleman make when you shoot them.Please do not buy this.It was a waste of money even though I only paid about 5 dollars for it."
2,Not very fun,"This is overall not a very good game. It is hard to control and there is no aimer. It is also very hard to make out the enemys. The only thing good is that the graphics are pretty good. The game is also boring. You have to go around looking for enemys and you move slow. If you get lost, it takes forever to get back. Do not spend your money on this game!!!"
5,Incredible and inspiring,"This tarot deck is the one I use above all my others, having done Tarot for over seven years. I spent a long time researching to find the perfect deck for me, and this is the one, using images and archetypes from nature rather than the material ones (eg. swords, knight of.., etc). It has been used constantly since that time and has been an invaluable guide. I cannot recommend it too highly."
4,pleases my toddler,"CAN WE FIX IT? YES WE CAN! is the rallying cry for Bob the Builder and his friends, including his cat Pilchard. At age 2 1/2, my son LOVES this video, and he asked for it daily for several days after I had to return it to the library.The characters are funny, and the episodes teach cooperation and respecting others.The characters are not annoying at all. I enjoy watching Bob the Builder myself.ken32"
1,wrong item,After receiving DVD we found it to have the wrong movie in it. I contacted the seller and my credit card was credited for the purchase right away. very happy with the seller and I would definetly do bussiness with them again. Thank You for your Quick honest response.
5,Very cute book.,"Purchased for my grandsons and they love it! It's such a sweet book that I don't mind reading it to them again and again. Plus, since the stories are interesting, they are really motivated to try and read it themselves."
4,Kindle Editions,"Length:: 0:57 MinsI had a tough time finding reviews for children's books on the Kindle. This is a classic. As for the port to a Kindle it actually works pretty well. The pictures are nice. My main complaint is that at times you have pages that are only pictures and it would have been nice if they could have put some words with each picture. My son enjoyed it...and that's the important thing. Overall, good. Just not as good as I had hoped for."
5,love oldie's,"I was looking for this song "" tell it like it is"" and ""angel baby"" and this cd had it all plus more! Thanks, it arrived on time and the quality of the cd was very good. Thanks again. bye"
4,Easy flow,the book was easy to follow and the cd was a great help. I was able to teach my 10 yr old and my 13 yr old.
3,"Original ""Trip"" is a Video Treasure","While I will always maintain that the original ""A Trip Down Market Street"" is a video treasure, in my opinion the rest of DVD content is of no value. That said the price was well worth adding this film to my collection... I just won't waste my time viewing the other films again. Two stars off just for the wasted time... otherwise five stars for the original film."
3,Live Choose Your Mask Tour 2CD set,"This is a nice FM quality recording of the 1982 Masks Tour. Thelineup is Brock, Bainbridge, Langton, Turner & Griffin. It has anice booklet with the lyrics (though printed rather small) Songs are Choose Your Mask,Coded Languages, Magnu, Angels of Death,Psychedelic Warlords, a killer version of Social Alliance, Waiting for Tomorrow, Solitary Mind Games, Brainstorm with Ejection-Shot Down In The Night-Master Of the Universe combined as an encore. It is an album which will be enjoyed bay any true Hawkwind fan. The quality could be a bit better as the name implyes, but it's not too bad."
3,Take the rough with the smooth,"First the ""smooth"": I got this album because it had such good reviews; namely well recorded and a competent collection/anthology. I would certainly agree with those comments and overall it is a worthy addition to the long time Hawkwind fan's collection.On the ""rough"" side: This CD brought back the uglier memories of seeing Hawkwind live in the early 80's (which I did many times, including this tour) - the inclusion (tough to edit out I suppose) of Nik Turner's ghastly (IMHO) saxophone playing. Off key at best, a distraction from the powerful space rock music at worst. On listening to this album I remembered why some Hawkwind concerts left such a bitter aftertaste; Nik's terrible sax.Oh well, you can always fast forward past those bits and enjoy the rest which is space rock at its best by the best band in the genre."
4,Details other books miss!!!,"This book is descriptive in a way that other books are not. It is in a style that is interestingly informative giving the reader a look into the heart and mind of Scotland and the Scots. It contains a background on the history of the nation, but in a way so as not to send one off to sleep. It gives a context to allow one to develope an understanding of the Scottish psyche. Geddes MacGregor is a Scot who has lived out of Scotland, giving him an advantage of knowing his subject but also knowing what people who have never had the opportunity of going to Scotland want to know. I would have liked to have seen more photos, it only has a few black and white ones, and a new edition would be timely to take into account the new Scottish self government. Despite the dearth of photos it is a worthwhile book, for it's excellent descriptive approach."
4,"History, Humor and People","I found this book to be wonderfully informative and extremely entertaining. I found the history presented in relative terms; not dry and boring as in some books. The humor is uniquely Scots. The information about the Scottish people is hard to find anywhere. The only negative is that as time passes, this book becomes an unfinished work. The recent events of Scottish Nationalism and self-government are sadly missed. However, it is an excellent read for those wanting to know the true nature of Scotland and its people, not just who ruled and when."
1,frightful!,"I purchased this book and returned it hurriedly after I started reading it. It's horrendously twee, the kind of ""heather, haggis, and shortbread"" view of Scotland that causes most Scots I've met to shudder. It's also very dated, both in its substance and in its presentation. If you want readable, popular history, there's better; if you want an introduction to Scotland and the Scots, there is more up-to-date. Pass by, reader, pass by."
5,Her best CD Ever!,"I bought this cd since my sister had stolen my original copy, lol. Need I say more?"
5,Laura rocks!!,"I love Laura Pausini, she has a special voice, she puts a special feeling in her songs, she is a great person and this CD ""Las cosas que vives"" is a five star, my advice? Buy it, you won't regret, actually you will love it. Laura rocks!!"
3,Information from the real band,"Half the songs on this CD are not the real Animotion. One of our best songs, ""I Engineer"" went to No 2 in Europe isn't even on this compilation! A better choice is the one on Polygram label released 1996. See the official Animotion web site for more info and tour dates. www.animotionlive.com"
5,Upbeat and fast-paced,"A great album for driving long distances. or even short distances, for that matter. ""Room to Move"" is a favorite of mine."
5,Read it aloud,"If you know a boy ... have a boy ... who ""doesn't like to read"", read him this one. You will love it and he will be pulled into Ian's world immediately. Besides, is there a better way to turn on a non-reader than to read aloud. Do it. Then give your copy to a sixth grade teacher so he/she can read it aloud to many kids every year."
2,Unedifying rendition of a magnificent piece,"Brahms' piano-quartet masterpiece was manhandled by uncertainty. Disappointing-I expected more than I got. The playing was not polished enough for publication in CD format. Best, choose another ensemble. There are many better renditions of this remarkable work for the same price."
4,acrimony-tumuli shoomaroom,I agree with the review above:this is one of the best albums I know together with 'Thick As A Brick' by Jethro Tull and 'Bomber'by Motorhead. I've had it for two or three years now and it gets better every time.
5,Essential Practical Spiritual Knowledge,I consider THE FOURTH WAY to be one of the top 100 spiritual books I have ever read. It describes a practice called Self-Remembering which makes us present-in-life and lifts us out of our robotic habits. It describes the emotional and chemical changes which happen in our body and mind when we do this practice. It talks about the two most important places to apply this willed effort (when we remember and when we are under an negative emotion which makes us not want to do it). The book gives a comprehensive advanced psychology which allows us to make deep sense of this practice. The only reservation about the book is that it makes the practice seem harder than it needs to be and it makes the theory feel overintellectual at times. This detracts from its practical value.
5,A guide pinnochio would keep by his bedside,"1. there is sleep2. there is not-asleep3. there is awakened4. there is beyond awakenedLife offers numbers 1 and 2. The fourth way offers 3 and four.Unlike most books, this one says believe in nothing, prove everything.Read this book. Discover everything for yourself!"
2,"Has some value but is not worth the effort,,,,","I read The Fourth Way some twenty five years ago. It is not an easy book to read. For the most part, it contains highly esoteric teachings which are largely unimportant. This notwithstanding, some of the topics covered are noteworthy. These include the sections on negative emotions, identification, and the need for sincerity.Anyone interested in studying and learning about highter consciousness should read a book entitled, ""I Am That,"" by SRI Nisargadatta Maharaj. This book is the most insightful and comprehensive volume on mysticism I have ever read. Another excellent resource on the same subject is, Handbook to Higher Consciousness, by Ken Keyes. This is another truly exceptional work. Both are well worth the effort!"
5,GREAT,"If your local store is like mine, then it's really hard to find a LARGE supply of condoms. Most of the time they only have a 12 pack. I guess that's good if you don't mind going to the store like EVERY OTHER DAY. But some of us just want to go once a week, so that's why I stepped it up and bought this 36 pack. Not only is it a great buy, but you also get a great variety. After all, you wouldn't wear the same sweater on two dates in a row, right? So you need a little variety all over. And this pack comes with brands you can trust, like Trojan and Durex, as well as brands you've never heard of that may or may not be manufactured in a crazy man's basement, like Trustex. Because everyone could use a little more danger and risk in their life."
2,NOT MUCH VARIETY!,"The product details and pictures makes this package look great but I didn't receive any Kimono's or the Trojan's that it showed. Most of what i got was like 9 yellow and 9 red Trustex. What the HECK! None of the ""fun"" little stuff like the suckers or the glow in the darks are there either."
2,Lack of Choice,"It would have been great to choose how many lubed and non-lubed condoms you wanted. I don't use the non-lubed, but half of the package was non-lubed. They were wasted."
1,Disappointing.,"1. Ordered ""expedited"" took four business days came first class. Could've been priority mail.2. Packaging was awful! Came in a bubble envelope... By the time it arrived, the envelope was all dirty and crumpled. Product needs to be wrapped in at least ziploc bag before putting it straight into an envelope!3. Product description very poor. ""Assortment"" was minimal. NO rings. Yes, each shipment may vary, but this was EXTREME lack of variety. Lubed, no lube, ribbed, thin, regular...4. Needs a better picture showing closer image of actual content. No Trustex, No Kimono, No Trojan. Only Durex and Lifestyles.5. Contacted seller six days ago-No response. If it wasn't for their ""store policy"", I'd have requested a refund, but threw out contents instead."
1,Ridiculous variety,Save yourself the money and just buy some from your local drug store. The only use I can imagine for this set is if you want to throw them in your drawer and hope your roomates are impressed.
3,"Good, on the hunt filming, a little lacking in tactics","Capstick is a bit of a hero for me. So I would watch a video of just him talking. With that in mind,I like the feel of AFRICAN LION. Just as in his books Capstick is able to give you a little of the rush that comes only to those who are hunters of hunters. There are no big charges but in 1 or 2 spots you can catch the hunting jitters from this video."
3,Capstick speaks,"The video has only one lion kill, but covers several days of hunting, tracking, and stalking. Capstick passes on a large male with a medium mane. His hunting partner takes a very similar lion later in the video but on a completely seperate hunt. I enjoyed the video simply because it has Capstick on film talking about hunting. Make no mistake though that this video is for Capstick fans as opposed to those seeking documentaries of lion hunting or a lot of technical advice."
5,Take my advice...,"...and don't listen to the whiny, liberal reviews. If God didn't want Capstick to shoot animals, He would've made their skin out of kevlar."
1,poor form,"I have to say that I saw this video out of curiousity more than anything and it sickened me to my stomach. How Capstick calls taking potshots at animals hundreds of metres away 'fair game' I'll never know. I have worked on game reserves in South Africa and the first thing I learned was that the true measure of one's 'manhood' is not how accurately they can place a pellet in an animals head from afar but rather, one's ability to stalk and coexist. To shoot is easy, but to study, follow and enjoy is the true challenge. Capstick's lame attempts to justify the slaughter as 'conservation' are transparent and represent the consumerism and exploitation that has eaten away at the African habitat through Western Imperialism. If you want to learn about wildlife then look at the modern day animal safari books instead of the primative blood-lusting acts of cowardice which South Africa wishes to erase from its memory."
1,Cowardly acts,"Anyone interested in books on wildlife may have chanced upon this nut called Peter Hathaway Capstick. I made the mistake of buying this video hoping for some footage of art of tracking different animals. What I watched on the video was truly disgusting, a bunch of cowards going after innocent animals with powerful guns equipped to shoot at animals from safe distances. Mr.Capstick also fashions himself as some kind of a hero with all his talk and posturing as someone knowledgable about the African bush and one may also get the false impression after reading his book, but his true identity is clear on the video. He is a wheezy old geezer who thinks he is being a man by shooting at these animals who would probably not dare to even take a step in the bush without his gun. Shame on you sir,and everyone who thinks like you."
3,Good basic reference,"This has a lot of classic poses. It shows how the body works in a lot of different positions, how joints rotate, things line up etc. However the male models are rather formless. There is no muscle definition or contour. They work OK for outlines, but for instance, a full back view in a sitting position shows a plain rectangle, you can barely tell where the backbone is. That said, there is a pretty good variety of positions and a wonderful variety of POV angles on each pose."
5,Classic Health Information that WORKS!,"Adele Davis' classic descriptions of vitamins, minerals and what they do should be on every one's shelf. She got it right and her classic books are the standard for getting and staying well. After all, body structure and chemistry have not changed and her suggestions and remedies WORK. It is a shame she is not still around to apply her expetise to some of today's tough health problems, but, she has left us with the basics to keep our bodies and immune systems tip top. This is a ""go to first"" book for many major health problems or to just ""stay fit."" Chances are, what ails you is a deficiency or combo of one. Just what are you deficient in? Check to see if the information works for you!!! The best part of the whole book is the Index. Use it well."
2,Chopped up songs,"I bought this CD solely because I wanted the ""Blue collar"" track and found that the last three minutes of the song were edited out...Big let down."
1,Horrendous Music For Simpletons,"I first heard this ear-ravaging drivel when I was about fourteen years-old back in the mid-1970s. And even then, I was intelligent enough to realize that this was unquestionably, music for morons. The vocals are mercilessly irritating and sound like a bunch of dumb jocks singing in a locker room. The lyrics sound like they were written by someone with a single-digit IQ who was intoxicated as well. How this group-or whatever they really were-got to be so popular is truly beyond me. ""Taking Care of Business"" ranks, in my opinion, as one of the stupidest songs ever written in recording history. And having to hear this song over and over on the radio at the time felt like some kind of punishment being inflicted upon me by God himself for whatever reason."
5,Just try it!,"I spent years and years learning about Paraguayan music and still I found this CD very interesting. Besides its high quality, I was extremely pleased to find the famous classical ""Gallito Cantor"" (by J.A. Flores) in its rare Paraguayan harp version. That single piece makes the entire CD worth to try! In general, this CD is great for those who are about to explore the amazing world of the Paraguayan folk music."
1,Avoid this version,"This is just an edited and repackaged version of the classic Principia Discordia, with a new title so they could slap a copyright on it. Avoid it and get one of the others, or one of the many copies on the web."
1,Disgusting,"How shameless can you get? As other reviewers have noted, this is a poor quality ripoff of a public domain work."
1,...,A better example of an artist misunderstanding the point of her subject I have never seen before.
1,Yes please,I regularly buy reprinted editions of public domain works. Please support the publisher by buying a used copy. Hail Eris.
1,Ronin Publishing is a hippie hack!,"Ronin Publishing runs a crappy website with fruity hippie garbage regurgitated in shoddy paperbacks.They will steal anything they can from the public domain just to turn a quick buck. Not only have the confused Discordianism with Neo-Pagans and other pseudo-hippie, crystal rubbing non-sense, they seem to think Discordianism is some cute, trendy crap like everything else they publish.Like Doctor Evil said, ""There is nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster""Read it off the web its online everywhere! Hail Eris! and F RONIN PRESS!"
1,Horrible ripoff,"At first I thought this would be a wonderful remix of the Principia Discordia, updated like the New King James Version or something. After opening the book, I was immediately disappointed. My mistake for not returning it, as it sits on my shelf, a reminder that sometimes originals should simply not be messed with. Every minute I spend with it reveals more typos, sloppy edits, and obviously messed-up intentions. And worst of all, it claims it is protected by copyright, simply because it plagiarizes a copylefted work but makes a few changes here and there. Garbage.Get the original from Loompanics or (my favorite) the Steve Jackson Games edition. This one is a waste of time, money, and paper."
4,Steal this review.,"Alterations to the unalterable holy text improve the Godness quotient of this rampant publication.Preternatural references to the Godless Padre Pederastia cannot help but uncover certain samenesses within blue typography.Samoan natives try, and Alaskan King Crab weep. But, still, without copyright nor copyleft, nor common copies, all stand."
5,Whatever Black Hole did for you...,"Green Winter will take you higher. Taking cues from the Love Tractor past, there's a terrific cover of Roxy Music's Three and Nine, which I like even better than the original. There are some weird keyboard moments across the whole record that take me back to old LT records, while remaining vigilant in the pursuit of this trilogy of records. It's an amazing trip and should be listened to in full - like classic rock albums of the past.Old fans don't seem to realize - the old band was asked if they wanted to record with Mike. They all said no. Since Mike was/is the frontman, vocalist, guitarist - he kept going! You're going to get down on him for that? Come on - I got multiple words - Fleetwood Mac, Genesis, Heart, etc. etc. Comfortablity isn't compatible with creativity. This is a trip of a record. Don't take the trip if you don't want to."
4,Dad's requesting that I write a review,"I have a lot of lego Star Ships and this one is more durable than most of them. Overall it was pretty easy to build. I like the way the star fighter hooks to the docking station. The docking station was the most difficult part to build. I really like the jedi's that came with it, Obi-wan Kenobi and Kit Fisto. I would recommend this product.Parker."
4,christmas present,"Ordered for my grandson for Christmas. He loves assembling these Lego products. Unfortunately, once asssembled, he seems to spend less time than I'd hoped actually playing with them. Could be just him. I would probably order again."
1,Not what I had expected.,"I was duped. This item I ordered for my niece was supposed to be in its original box, with a booklet telling you how to build it, not in a cardbox box pre assembled already and with out the booklet to finish it. I give it a negative 50 out of a 10"
3,Don't overextend your expectations -- enjoy!,"This is not The Moody Blues, or Yes. It isn't The Who's ""Tommy"" or Tull's ""Aqualung"". It is just a handful of random songs from the '60's. If that is what you seek, or you want to fill some gaps in your collection, or you just cannot find the Wee-Five's greatest hits, this is fine.Indeed, there is no theme, no nexus between the songs. They are unrelated, save the fact that they all seemed to get lots of airplay back in the day. Where else might one find ""You Don't Own Me"", or ""You Were On My Mind""? For that reason these '45's on CD are nice collections.My only beef remains that there is a lot of empty space in these discs. They could put twice as many songs on one."
2,"one stereo rarity, some mono versions for no apparent reason","interestingly, they managed to find the ultra-rare *stere* mix of We Five's ""YWOMM"" (heretofore only available on one of Dick Bartley's excellent comps). Stranger is that they put ""King of the Road"" and ""You've Got Your Troubles"" (commonly available in stereo) in MONO. A waste of money unless you're getting it for under $5."
2,Another corporate-created random collection of '60s tunes,"Why on Earth would anyone think that this is supposed to be aBeatles compilation? The title is pretty clear, I think: ""45'son CD -- 1964-1965."" That covers a pretty wide girth.This is basically another one of your '60s collections that have been thrown together without much thought as to theme. It jumps willy-nilly from country (Roger Miller's ""King of the Road""), to sappy ballads (""You've Got Your Troubles""), to the standard frat-house stompers (""Wooly Bully""), to folk-rock (""You Were On My Mind"") to surf (""Little Honda""). None of these tunes really work together. It's your standard cut-and-paste collection of '60s tunes.A mediocre collection at best. END"
3,Excellent Hip-Hop Funk from Public Enemy Spinoff,"""Banned for Life"" is the debut album from The BaNNed, the backup band for veteran hip-hop group Public Enemy. Group members featured on this EP include DJ Lord (turntable man for Public Enemy since 1999), DJ Johnny 'Juice' Rosado, Khari Wynn on guitar, Mike Faulkner on drums, and bandleader Brian 'Hardgroove' Hargrove. These instrumentals here combine rock, funk and hip-hop with revolutionary fervor.A bonus DVD includes a couple of music videos from the group, as well as behind-the-scenes footage, and bonus imagery from fellow Slam Jamz artists."
5,Sir Bob can fix it!,"Bob the builder is great fun. My two boys are big fans, and even I get a kick out of Bob, Wendy, and all his talking equipment. This is longer than most of the Bob the Builder shorts, but the kids watch just as intently. Bob's dad (and near the end his Mom) are a great addition to the Bob family of characters, and this episode even has a little suspense...though nothing to upset the little ones."
1,10 minutes of advertisements!,"I was very frustrated when I put this DVD in. You cannot navigate it at all, and it forces you to sit through 10 minutes of advertisements for other HIT products before the show begins. If you know what it is like to have your child whine in a grocery store for candy and gum displayed prominently at child eye-level in the check-out line, you know the feeling.This reason alone makes it totally unsuitable for repeat viewing. I give it the lowest rating."
2,Disappointing waste of time,"For those looking for the fresh creativity and quirky semi originality of their first album, you'll find nothing here but a sub-mediocre, contrived and pretentious load of rubbish. It's too bad these guys have to waste such brilliant guitar work on their below average song writing and goofy vocals. Not to say the album doesn't have a few moments, such as the first track, but it peaks there and stumbles down hill. I listened to it sober and I listened to it stoned and it just doesn't cut it. Perhaps this album will impress 11-14 year olds. Yet another example of a band with the right idea that falls short. Don't waste your time or money. For something similar, but better, see: Simian, the Kingsbury Manx, Super Furry Animals, or the Byrds."
2,Move along...this is hollow in multiple ways.,"Kinda like a bad trip that has a few touching moments amidst shambly chaos. I dug their first album in opposite fashion. ""Once We Were Trees"", has a good title and cover design, but the possibilities alluded to by the title are not coherently presented. The music is drowned out by noise. I suppose it is a matter of taste. There are better records to buy with your fifteen bucks. Try The Apples In Stereo."
1,Birkenstock Cowboys,"This was recommended to me by a store clerk who had a decent knowledge of Uncle Tupelo and it's successor bands. I don't know what the significance (if any) of the name Beachwood Sparks is, but they should think about changing their name to Birkenstock Cowboys, or maybe Rodeo Tree Huggers. The music sounded pretentious and overemotive, completely sans-hook, and the philosophy evident in the lyrics essentially oversimplified transcendentalism. Think Thoreau on his most overbearing days, wandering around Walden on an acid trip, losing focus and taking it out on a guitar.I won't be back for more."
4,They don't make em like this anymore,"When I was young, I sometimes had to listen to new Beatles records several times before I got it..and when I got it, I became obsessed with the album..and stayed that way. Beachwood Sparks' second album strikes me with pretty much the same reaction. After several listenings, I was hooked as I was with their first recording. Their creativity in blending that country Byrds/Beatles/psychedelic feeling is a real welcome throwback to an earlier time in rock history. Think lap steels mixed with Rickenbacker 12 strings and ambient tape sounds over real catchy melodies and you get the picture."
4,not just the neo-byrds,"Upon hearing the Beachwood Sparks, I, like so many others, quickly retorted with comparisons to the Byrds, the Grateful Dead, Buffalo Springfield, Gram Parsons and so on. Let it be said that these comparables are certainly justified. Without them, it would be difficult to describe exactly what it is that Beachwood Sparks are shooting for. However, there is an element of reverb-drenched, sonic experimentation that adds innovation and depth to their compositions, far transcending any similar attempt by their previously mentioned and oh so obvious influences.Which gets me to my point: if you love both the vintage 1960's west coast sound and the sonic experimentation that has flourished so much since, there is hardly a better band than Beachwood Sparks.If this is the case, get both Once We Were Trees and the album Beachwood Sparks."
3,sad time in Rose's life,"This is a sad tale about Rose's life during the years right after leaving Rocky Ridge Farm in Missouri and moving to California. The cover illustration has nothing to do with the story, and is rather misleading because this book deals with Rose becoming a city girl in an era when most people traveled by train or street car. Rose seems to be very isolated in California, and her few friends are a sordid crowd from which she meets her future husband, Gillette Lane. After falling in love & marrying, Gillette becomes mixed up in several financial schemes causing the couple to have legal and personal issues. Rose has to deal with much of the aftermath on her own, as she realizes the magnitude of her husband's actions. The book left me with such a desolate feeling."
3,Read 1/2 the book,"He is an apologist for becoming conservative, which I felt was unnecessary.The book gets repetitive. You should choose to read either the first half or the second half, but don't bother with the whole thing. Well written otherwise."
4,"In all things, moderation","What, another diatribe against the liberal agenda? Who is it this time. Robert Bork? Pat Buchanan? Dan Quayle? Oliver North? No, it's Harry Stein, erstwhile liberal turned conservative (actually, more like moderate but to a leftist that's probably a distinction without much of a difference). He gives a recounting of how he turned from being a left-leaning liberal to the realization that the conservative voices he'd always disdained were actually starting to sound right, not simply right-wing. Along the way, he skewers most of the herd of liberal sacred cows: feminism (his favourite punching bag), affirmative action, multiculturalism, etc. On the issue of abortion he's still pro-choice, but at least he's asking the right questions: which is more sacred, ""human life or the woman's right to choose"". His anecdotes from the last 30 years of his life are both funny and chilling, humourously appealing and mouth-droppingly appalling. An entertaining read."
2,Beating a Dead Horse throughout!,"Although, I can relate to Harry's new found political philosophy, I would have liked to have had more issues addressed. He spent way too much time with feminism and not enough time with the issues of today. The tile should be ""How I discovered the lies of feminism."" Furthermore, do we really need more opinion oin Clinton's escapades?"
1,Boring,"The title sold me on the book.. I am happy for Mr. Stein for finding his inner piece, however, his story of how he got there was painfully boring. During every page I turned, I was hoping that the pace or direction will go somewhere. Eventhough, I was excited about the subject matter, there are better books out there that are more interesting"
1,Waste of time and intellect,"The tone of the other reviews says it all. If you're a fan of Dr. Laura or others who love to hate, then you'll like this book. I was hoping to find provocative arguments but came away disappointed. The author's attempts to prove his ""liberal"" roots are laughable. The title of the book should be How I Purposefully Joined the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy so I Could Make Money."
3,Politcal Conversion in Progress,"Catchy title, but Mr. Stein, in the end, is more of a moderate Republican than a Right-wing Conspirator. His stories of feminist extremism and other conservative Points of view are similar to Rush Limbaugh's books of the early 90s.What's different is his political upbringing and conversion to right-of-center politics. As an ex-hippie and ex-member of the vast left-wing media, Mr. Stein shares telling examples of how journalism works. He describes the assumptions that liberal media types make when reporting a certain kind of story. These are the tales that he tells best, and why the book is worth the time.Stein's conversion may still in progress it would seem. He has harsh words for conservative stalwarts Trent Lott and Tom Delay, he is pro-choice with some reservations and he's more accepting of marginal behaviors than mid-American Republicans. I guess you would best describe him as a Compassionate Conservative that Found Inner Peace."
4,An Entertaining Read,"Harry Stein began as a liberal, started thinking about the issues and the approaches to them espoused by the liberal orthodoxy including the NY Times, Feminists, Rev. Jackson, etc and lo and behold, discovered he no longer agreed. This book is an amusing exploration of his journey as well as a satire of liberal views. It also makes me realize I am not as alone in my views as watching CNN would make me think. And to top it all off, his daughter chooses the best college she could given these times, my alma mater, The University of Chicago. Great book, worth reading."
4,A Refreshing Breath of Critical Thought,"As a Bred-in-the-Bone liberal Jew, I tried hard for years to suppress these niggling doubts I had about certain stances, i.e. - the ethics of abortion, morality of those who represent the Democratic party, etc. I feared that caving on any of these issues would make me seem to be a horrible, callous conservative. Well, the past few years have been unbearable and I must rebel against all this fuzzy-headed liberalism, and it does my heart good to read that others are facing this same crisis with clear heads and a sense of humour. I found myself nodding vigorously as I read Mr. Stein's book and wondering why so many people refuse to see such hypocrisy as he outlines in this book. An open mind and a personal determination to examine our own behaviour and motivations will benefit us all."
4,Another Liberal grows up,"Stein joins a number of Leftists who find that simply sounding like you care and feeling good about it doesn't solve social problems. His focus on the specific events which led to his ""coming out"" makes this an easy and entertaining read. Readers who find this insightful will learn even more from Sowell's, ""Vision of the Anointed""."
4,Political Thought Draped Behind Humor,"This is a good book to read if you're Conservative. It has some nice anecdotes, some humor, but nothing earth shattering in the way of politcal thought. I can only hope that every liberal will evolve into a Conservative."
5,At its best,"If you like Spock's Beard or super-group Transatlantic, you will absolutely adore this cd. I say this because throughout this cd you will often find yourself as if you were listening to Transatlantic or to the SB's classic The Light. I can't understand why people criticize this cd simply because of its christian lyrics. Just pay attention to the music that so limited amount of people can create: a masterpiece. You can really tell that Neal was not alone while writing One. This time, he was open with drummer Mike Portnoy (especially in Author of Confusion) and bassist Randy George. This CD is heavier than Testimony, although it still contains the great touches of violin and others. If you are open-minded to different types of rythmes in the same song, just buy this album. You will not regret it."
5,God exists and really does love everyone no matter what they've done,Neal spins a tale through the wonderful medium of progressive rock that relays the story of the human race from fall to redemption. This is not Neal's best work (? is) but there is enough here to keep even the pickiest prog fan happy and quite content. There are some Christian lyrics but they are done with very good taste and stick to the flow of the storyline. People that have a problem with these lyrics probably have just completely shut God out of their lives and really can't help but hate the words that shed light because of the darkness they are living in. Kind of like Plato's cave. But they probably don't even know who that is either...
3,Touching versus teaching,"It's hard to fault Morse for failing to deliver a convincing whole package on any of his elaborate and lengthy solo discs, but there can only be so much instrumental inspiration before the bombastic prog-pop yearnings center around formulaic religious lyrics."
5,The 3rd Transatlantic CD,"This cd sounds like Transatlantic's 3rd with Randy George taking over from Trewavas and Stolt. Mike Portnoy is at his best here especially on the heavy ""Author of confusion"". The lyrics are too Christian for my taste but if Mike Portnoy who's Jewish can deal with them then so can I!"
3,A Weird But Funny Episode By The Z,"First off, the introduction of the female longneck: Ali was a little weird at first. I bet Cera is gonna have some competition with Ali making the first ever love triangle in the land before time series. The songs were pretty funny but some were annoying like ""Who needs you?"" It gave Ichy and Dill a chance in the spotlight but the song is D-U-M-B. ""Grandma's Lullaby"" For once, Grandma is given a chance to sing and it made an impact in the series. But the best was aved for last ""It takes all types"" gives Ali a chance to sing that all creatures are different in all shapes and sizes. That is basically the moral to the story. Too bad Ali had to go. She would have amde a very valuable asset to the gang making her the voice of reason. All in All, this was a pretty good episode but I hope Ali comes back..."
2,Journey Through the Mists,My 2 yr old absolutely loves The Land Before Time series but this is one we could have done without. The bad guys are really bad and Ducky's voice is different and more irritating. We usually love Ducky's little voice but not on this one. Normally my son loves the songs and sings along with them but on this one he just fusses for me to skip past the singing.
4,Very good purchase,"I recieved the product I ordered quickly and in perfect condition. Very simple and easy transaction,"
1,THE WORST LAND BEFORE TIME,I am a fan of the Land Before Time series but this was horrible. it was boring and had a bad plot.
5,My kids loved it!,We had a great time watching this one. My kids are always asking to see it again. I appreciate the positive messages too!
5,Land B4 time movies are the best,I am an adult who love kid movies. I think ALL the Land B4 time movies are great. My kids have watch each of these movies over and over and over..... (so have I:) My kids own every one of these movies. We can't wait til they come out with another one.
4,approval,"This VHS tape arrived damaged, and I wrote that it was and I would like a replacement. The company that sent it, replied speedily with an affirmative answer. We received the replacement within a matter of a few days. Thank you. The movie was wonderful and my GreatGranddaughter is very happy with her 7th L B T movie."
1,regret buying this one,I was very disappointed with this title having seen V which was MUCH better. The story line plodded along and the villians were more irritating than funny. The songs weren't appealing to my 3-year old.
1,Disappointed,"I couldn't get the closed caption or ASL to work. I had a family movie night planned for my deaf preschool children and their families and I had to cancel. It doesn't even say on the box that it has ASL. I called tech people and had the school tech people working on this, but never had success."
3,Old information,"The book is well organized, and much of the information is solid. However, everything is so dated that you have to concern yoursel with the possibility that some information is no longer considered accurate or beat practice."
4,"Lonely Planet - Useful, as always11","I've always used Lonely Planet travel guides in my travels. There's way more to NYC than a guidebook could ever cover but Lonely Planet did a great job as it always does. It's always good to know that I can trust LP to provide the basic information regarding how to get to/from the airport, transportation around the city as well as other information regarding sights and restaurants."
1,Very disappointing,Usually lonely planet is great. This book unfortunately is poorly organized and covers the highlights that everyone already knows. Not worth it.
4,"Good guide, but double-check the maps","I had to buy this book at the last minute, due to the fact that I wasn't contented with the format and information thatNew York (Eyewitness Travel Guides)had, which I borrowed from a friend. And I was fairly contented with the amount of information that LP has for this book. It has a detailed coverage of Manhattan and its neighborhoods, and it covers areas outside Manhattan more extensively than the other book.The one complaint I have about this edition is that they do not double-check the maps. The map at p. 282 especially is at fault. For example, the Majestic Theater is at w 44th St. but the map lists it as somewhere in 41st St. Perhaps somebody forgot to proofread the maps this time."
1,Just stick to Fodor's.,"I actually returned this book. It had next to no pictures and was very poorly organized. The categories were neither by theme nor geography, so it was really hard to find anything or make much sense of the book. Most of the text was just the writers' cheesy editorializing that fell very short of their attempt to be witty and insightful. When I buy a travel book, I want to be informed and guided, and this book did neither of those things."
2,Very difficult to use,"I've been a Lonely Planet traveler for over a dozen years. I was excited about being able to leave the bulky tomes home and be able to use them on the Ipad for instant reference on the road.Alas, not so much.Very difficult to navigate and the maps are virtually worthless the way they are spread across several pages and scrolling is difficult.LP is a great resource. If they want to continue to be the go-to reference for me, they have to clean up their act on the digital version and actually field test their product before unleashing it on the unsuspecting public.What they need to to to improve their digital guide:Google style maps with improved scrolling and searchClick on an icon and have the info (eats, drinks, sights) pop up.Better indexing of articlesI still buy the print versions of the LP guides but feel they are far behind in making the digital versions as useful."
2,High price,"I thought it was cheap but you can find great deal with Walmart online. Walmart has many books that have greater deal than Amazon. Of course, Amazon has more sources of books but if you look for a specific book and you have the title, always check with Walmart.com before you place an order with Amazon. You can get one with cheaper price.Beside the price, we haven't read the book yet since my daughter now just sticks with her ""The Great Monkey Race"", we haven't got a chance to read this book with her, so not know yet if she will like it. But I myself think the book is nice and sweet."
5,Great software; on sale at Staples,This student helper software makes the best Santa's gift this Xmas! It's got tons of tools and runs smoothly on my PC.BTW it's on sale for almost free at Staples this week. Merry Xmas!
1,MS Student 2007 not recommended,"I am a secondary math teacher looking for software resources of which MS Student will not be included. I utilize other electronic curriculums and am familiar with (& own)other programs on the market for Algebra, and was very disappointed that Student 2007 contained very little actual text book source info, contrary to several reviews that deceived me. It is ok as a supplement to text books, particularly where a graphing calculator is used, but will not tutor students as claimed in a systematic fashion. Student 2007 disappoints me because it claims: ""In one convenient package, Microsoft Student 2007 provides students with templates, organizational tools, tutorials, translator tools, and a just about everything else they'll need to finish -- and ace! -- their French homework, algebra exam and research papers."" Wrong choice for algebra. Glad I only bought one copy for me."
5,Great Educational Tool!!!,"I've been using this product for awhile, and I'm delighted with it. I got my Algebra I Homework done in 1/5 the time it usually takes me! In addition to this, when I feel like learning, I watch some of the Discovery Channel videos that are included with this. Even better is that this product comes with a $[...], reducing its overall price to $[...]. Today I'm going to use it to help me write a five paragraph essay.I love Microsoft Student with Encarta Premium 2007, and you will too! Buy it! Trust me, you WON'T be disappointed."
5,Ms. Pac Man is great!,I rented this for my 7 year old daughter and she enjoyed it so much we had to rent it again. I had a hard time finding this game to purchase until I thought of buying it online. My daughter and I enjoyed it very much. I do recomend the extension pac for memory. If you turn off the game you will have to begin from the very beginning without it. :-)
3,The company cancelled the order,American Apparel clothing is great- gets softer and better with each wash...and its an ethical company so I definitely recommend buying their stuff. This order was cancelled so I can't truthfully rate the item.
1,Ancient of Days Stinks and is non-commercial (...)!,"This is just Pure Noise with sharp out of tune horns contrasted with a good bassist. Besides being noise,I do not reccomend this recording to the timid average listner who does not have the hard skin to take such abuse from a recording that is just artistically non profit junk."
4,Better that Expected,"I was concerned after reading some reviews about it being difficult to set up or not working. I followed the simple steps and was able to get several successful launches on the first try. The rocket is a lot safer than I thought it would be. No massive explosion and the rocket does not go much higher than 85 feet. Will not get lost, even in a smaller field. Great and safe introduction to model rockets and hydrogen fuel."
3,Worked but I broke it!,"I got this rocket for Christmas. I produced hydrogen for one complete cycle and got a launch of 2-3 feet. I produced hydrogen for 2 complete cycles that resulted in a launch of 100 feet or so. Just like any other guy, I next produced hydrogen for 5 (five) cycles, and blew the rocket apart on the ground, although there were a few pieces that traveled 30 feet or so upwards. I had a 'blast' with it and immediatly went back to internet to buy parts. Decent fun for 40 [...]!"
4,Directions Need Work - But Good Fun,"We have had plenty of experience with the 'regular' Estes rockets that use powder engines - so we thought this hydrogen rocket would be a fun lesson.It is a great way to introduce kids to the process of generating hydrogen fuel, and the benefits of using hydrogen.The problem with the rocket is that 1 cycle of generation never seemed to produce enough hydrogen to get a lift off. Once I let the cycle run through twice before ignition - we got a decent launch (twice) of ~100' (30.48 meters).The base unit gives some useful recordings with facts about hydrogen while the process of electrolysis generates the gas (about 3 minutes)."
2,Disappointing Fantasy,"Like most Beatlefans, I approached this book looking for a fun tale on what ""might have happened"" if the bubble never hit. However to me the only consistency was that Lennon was always going to be attracted to Asian women, George will still find fault in religion, Ringo stands by his friends, and Paul will always be the star. However, there was too much drivel and too little fun. Suprisingly to me the best characters I found were the Beatle wives, namely Maureen & Cynthia."
1,A waste of time,"The idea is great, the writing is poor. George Harrison a Jesuit priest, maybe. Half mad? Doubt it. John Lennon bitter middle age man, maybe. Sitting around doing nothing when not being ""Looney Lennon"" when crazy drunk and living on welfare? Doubt it. Paul McCarthy doing mediocre pop songs he wrote in Vegas, maybe. Womanizer who marries American celebrities who are known skanks? Doubt it. Ringo came the closest to the possible. I can see him married, fooling around, drumming for money on weekends barely making ends meet, drinking too much and too concerned about looking good.I could forgive the plot if the writing was better but it's bad. Nothing much happens but a lot of complaining about what could have been. That got boring. And maybe the slang they use is correct but you need a story. I found it a waste of time."
2,Unsatisfying,"'Liverpool Fantasy' works primarily as a vision of an alternative England, rather than a world without the Beatles. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's unlikely that John would've faded into the woodwork. His work would not have been as substantial without McCartney (and vice-versa), but he would have been a presence *somewhere*. The author fails to integrate the known characteristics of John, Paul, George, and Ringo effectively and bring them to life. Ultimately I put down the book and felt cheated; this wasn't an alternative history. It was a rant."
1,what is this?,"This book doesn't even deserve 1 star.I realize this is just a fantasy-type what-if book, but it was just plain poorly written. I really tried to read this book and had high hopes for it, but couldn't last past chapter 4. It's boring. The author should stick to his band and leave book writing to others.Don't even bother buying this book, it's a real stinker."
1,"If you are a Beatles fan, DO NOT buy this insipid potboiler!","I agree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this book is ""unsatisfying."" The writing style is sophomoric (downright corny) and the story has little to do with music."
5,Brain Tunes,"The Basals play the type of music that you can't get out of your head. Out of nowhere, a refrain from their hit song ""Angel in My Pocket"" will pop out of your mouth. The lead singer has an incredible voice and is backed up by an equally incredible band. I definitely would advise all music fans to buy this cd, which is destined to become a classic."
1,Don't buy this record,"This is the worst CD I've ever heard. Imagination was obviously absent in the studio this was recorded in. Don't waste your money. Get a good CD like ""Audience of One."""
5,BUY THIS MUSIC!,"Well, I have seen David live! I love all his albums--but the songs come to life with his wonderful explanations. The guy just writes beautiful songs--one after another. And his voice! It has a bit of a edge in the live setting. Listen to his vocabulary! All of this from a construction worker, school bus driver--and most importantly--the keeper of faith in the human heart.Buy all his music. He is a gentleman. He is a true original!"
4,Wonderful Reading,I enjoyed the creative stoy line in Tender Is The Storm. I thought Lucas was a kind but strong man. The love story between the two character were well written. These two character truly belonged together. This was a wonderful story.
4,"Not her best, but still very good!","I did enjoy this book alot. But do have to say it was not one of her best, but still a great book!!! I like the way Slade/Lucus was one in the same. It made it easier for Sharise not to have to chose."
3,It Was Not The Best.,"I think, sad to say that I really can't remember, that this is the 2nd book by Johanna Lindsey that I have read. I am an avid romance reader, especially historical romances. I found this book somewhat lacking in many respects. First, both Lucas and Sharisse each fall for one another based on lies. They're not even the people they actually claim to be. Second, why Sharise never questioned Lucas as to why Slade and himself were never in the same room together is beyond me. I also found that alot of important things that supposedly happened were cut out of the book to make it shorter. We were never shown the actual nuptials that took place between Slade and Sharisse or the birth of their daughters. These were all things that just happened without it being written. I prefer to read it while it's happening, not after the fact. I think this book could be taken out of the library rather than purchased."
2,Ugh,"I'm sorry, I don't like Westerns.... and I definitely didn't like this book. Everything about it just GOT to me... unbelievable plot and there was no chemistry whatsoever between Lucas and what's her name."
2,WOW can't Beliveve this book got 4 stars,"The story of Sharisse Hammond and Lucas Holt barely dragged along. I have this annoying tendency to finish what I have started and I was thinking to myself ""when is this story gonna finish and when is that ""dense Sharisse chick gonna figure out that Lucas and his twin brother are one and the same"" . All in all, save your money!"
1,The Worst Johanna Lindsey book I have ever read,"This book was just AWFUL. I thought this book would be good because of its high rating but I was wrong! I expected a love story, but all I got was incoherent babble. I didn't understand why the characters (Lucas and Sharisse) acted so unfriendly to each other like they just met, rather than being in love! This book is a complete waste of time. I recommend her other books."
1,Typical Lindsey,"This is a prime example of why I stopped reading Johanna Lindsey's books in the 80s. I would hazard a guess that her fans like to read the same story over and over and over and over. What else would explain the huge sales for her books, when they are virtually identical? This book is just like Fires in Winter, which is just like A Heart So Wild, which is just like... Well, you get the idea. Face it: Ms. Lindsey writes by template. She uses one plot, changing only the details such as names, places, physical characteristics. The first time she wrote the plot, it was great, then she wrote it at least 10 times in the 80s alone, and probably more than that in the 90s. It wears thin. But, hey, the masses apparently like endless repetition. Personally, I'd rather read a writer who bothers to try different plots, not one who writes a formula every time. If I could give all of her books no stars, I would."
1,Uncomfortable,These draw reins are hard and uncomfortable to ride with. I soaked them in warm neatsfoot to try to improve the feel but ended up buying new ones made of cotton instead.
4,Cute!!!,"My 1yr old son loves this book & all the pictures of kitties!The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I wish the author would have the pictures in a different order so that it's more working up to going to sleep. There are a few pictures that should be in a different order.Overall, though, very cute!"
4,go go g-boys,"cute and funny. would love to get an ((uncensored)) copy.story line is great, and a lot of good young actors."
2,Ran ridiculously small,"Ok, I know it's probably a junior fit and I'm a 42 year old woman who is a mother of three but I also am 5' 5"" and weigh 126 lbs. So why the heck is an XL close fitting on me.Seems to me, a way to get away with the least amount of material for the biggest profit. Don't bother. Get yourself some tiny-fit Old Navy tees when they are 2-fers and you won't go wrong."
1,Dangerous JUNK,I recently purchased the Vogelzaang model bx26e.I have to comment that having only used this stove twice I can safely safe this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased.The engineer must have been thinking this was for display only and not for burning anything. Some of the upper seams leak smoke. The fire door does not sit tightly against the frame and you can see flame on the other side. The damper collar almost sits outside of its recessed place and therefore leaks smoke the most.Made in chinaThis stove will kill someone.
1,Conflicting ads,"Vogelzang 96,000 BTU Cast Iron Boxwood Stove, Model# BX26EThis is against Northern Tool, not the product. After comparing their web-site with Amazon's ad, I see why my order was cancelled. N.Tool's ad states item cannot be shipped to CA, but the Amazon ad does not state that. I checked all of N.Tool's wood stoves, and the same applies to those stove's not allowed to be shipped to CA & WA."
4,A must for Luna fans,"I saw the premiere at the TriBeCa film festival and enjoyed the film immensely - and notably so did more tepid fans in tow. It's beautifully filmed, well-paced, and of course nicely scored. It provides an often funny and sometimes sad look into the realities of band life and the mixed emotions of deciding it's Time to Quit. The film is a fitting send-off for one of my favorite bands, and in many ways the indie pop era and the lost state of mind of Downtown NYC."
5,luna - tell me do you miss me,"If you are a Luna fan reading this review because you have not yet purchased the film, just do it! You'll be sad if you don't and your collection will be incomplete.Each interview, performance and comment offers a glimpse into their lives, as a band and as individuals, and like their music is another small gift to the world.Thank you Dean, Sean, Lee, and Britta, (Justin and Stanley too)."
4,A Visit from an Old Friend,"Anyone who knows me knows that I love Luna. Loved Luna I should say.Several friends and I went through college and our twenties listening to Luna's groovy, sometimes snarky, dreamy pseudo-pop music. And on lucky years in the fall, we would go to a Luna show - always a small venue and always a favorite show of the year.In late 2003, we went to our last Luna show - they had decided to call it quits. A chapter of our musical lives closed, and we were sad. But we still had our Luna Cds, and all the bootlegs we could get our hands on.And now we have this DVD. Luna: Tell Me Do You Miss Me. And yes, yes I do. But at least now I understand why they broke up - they all looked so tired and done with it. This is a lovely documentary of the decline and break-up of a band. Plus, there's great concert footage. Highly recommended for Luna fans and the newly enlightened as well."
3,Boring,"This CD falls into the category of ""Wish I hadn't bought it, but won't throw it away."" There are no memorable songs on here, some nice chill music, some super bland trancy background music, and a couple of horribly insipid love songs that I can't bear listnening to, one of which reminds me of Gloria Estefan. Except for the love songs, it's all easy to listen to. There are probably people who like the love songs (somebody's buying Gloria Estfan). Obviously some other people love this CD. It's OK, but I can't recommend it. Too bland and uninspired and there's better to be had. I've just bought it and I'm already pulling tracks off onto mixed CD's because this CD doesn't hold my interest, even on the first listen.Craig Armstrong, Charles Webster, The Dining Rooms, Boozoo Bajou, Hotel Costes, Buddha Bar, to name a few, are all better."
3,A Real Look,"Leslie Jennifer, seems to affiliate herself with a masterful plan of trying to cope with what must be depression. I felt like I could see what it was like through the eyes of this author. Never knowing where her mind was going, and where the book was going. The poetry is dark, and depressing at times masterfully done. just not my cup of tea. I recommend at least a look see."
3,Old Hippie Music,One of the first bands I saw play in the mid sixties. Brought back memories of a time of peace and love
3,Limited Functionality,"This card does support A2DP profile, so cannot connect to bluetooth stereo receivers or headphones and play stereo music via bluetooth."
2,zoom bluetooth,"I purchsed this card because I wanted a solution that would allow me to have a wireless mouse without a dongle that could snap off a USB port. It also was to provide the ability to use a GPs, bluetooth headphones and syncing my Dell Axim.well the mouse worked fine, however the card does not support the necessary technology to use the headphones and I couldnt get the axim to syncultimatly i sold the card on ebay because it couldnt work with the headphone, now keep in mind this isnt a headset. these were sterio headphone for music.the clencher was when i called zoom and they said they would call me back with a solution. I never heard anything.Due to poor custmer service and a product that is incapable of accomplishing my goal I had no choice but to get rid of it. I picked up a generic one at frys that was a CF card with a PCMCIA adapter that was very expensive that got the job done."
2,didn't work with Treo 700p,"I bought this card hoping to wirelessly sync calendar/contacts with my Treo, and to use it to connect my laptop to use the Treo's broadband (EVDO) network. At first I tried using the Bluetooth stack from on the mfr provided CD, which didn't work. I then tried uninstalling that and using the Bluetooth support built into Windows XP. I got the network connectivity to work barely (three ping responses and then got the error message ""general failure"") just once - couldn't get that to work reliably. And I could not get anything to work with Palm OS sync (apparently other reviewers have had success with Microsoft ActiveSync but I don't have a Windows-based Treo). Finally, trying to sync caused my Treo to crash. That's a PalmOS problem not a Zoom problem, but it made the card useless to me. I returned it, and now just plug my Treo in via USB."
2,Drivers caused huge problems,"I have an IBM Thinkpad T42, so this review should be qualified by the fact that any computer makes use of different drivers, but my computer is no more than 3 months old and yet the drivers for this device caused innumerable problems, and essentially the bluetooth did not function. This may be a good product for some, but it's far from a sure thing."
5,Complete and fun,"Has everything you need (as long as you order the omnibus edition) to learn to play, and lots of tunes to practice on. Highly recommended."
5,Great for self teaching.,Great information taught at a pace that makes sense. It is designed to be used with a teacher but can be done by yourself. It would be better with a CD that had the teacher's accompaniment to play with as shown in the lessons. I like the variety of songs and there are a lot of them. Its a hearty instructional book.
1,Do not buy this book,"I am very displeased with this book. There is very little that is basic about it. As a novice, it has left me completely in the dust. After using this book I am seriously thinking of returning my recorder, and doing something else.Definitly a no fun manual. It struck me to be in the same ballpark as reading lengthy insurance policies, or home mortgages."
1,"Flimsy, cheap","not a good buy, worst buy! Would definitely recommend to any of my friends.Look cheap, like second-handed one!Will never try this brand!"
1,Believe in happydogpotatohead - he knows his onions(!?),"Sadly, I can only echo and endorse happydogpotatohead's comments. I saw the band several times during '79 and the quality of this recording undermines some of my fondest memories of them.There are portions that sound as if you're listening from another room entirely and others with your head stuck in a bass bin. If I remember correctly, these shows were recorded while the Hawks were out of contract, having left Charisma, and they self-recorded these shows and hawked(!) the tapes around until Bronze picked them up - so maybe Bronze cherry-picked the best for 'Live '79'. For the record 'Satellite' is 'The Phenomenon of Luminosity' from 'Church Of Hawkwind'.Whereas 'Live '79' is very good this is poor - sometimes less is more! A tragedy and a crying shame."
2,An Okay Game,I wanted to get this game because it was 5 stars and sounded good. But when I started to play the controls were hard and everywhere you went there were enemies. I couldn't get past the 1st level. You had to find something that was impossible to find. But the graphics were a 10 and the weapons were good too. That's why I gave it 2 stars. It's a good game for those who like a 1-level game and those who just like to roam around. It's not worth buying.
4,Mostly good,Loved the DVD and the color for the second season. This DVD had a few skips in it. My only complaint.
3,"Silly, wholesome Entertainment","Silly, wholesome entertainment that transports you back to the time when life was so much simpler and we still knew how to dream and strive."
5,jeannie 2nd season,"This show hit its stride this season; lost some of the charm in the transition from B&W to color, otherwise no complaints."
4,second season,a good tv program from my childhood. I can recommend this program. Barbara Eden is pretty and funny.
4,I'm waiting for the release of Season 3 - the best one!,"I'm waiting for the release of Season 3 - the best one! This is where Jeannie's evil dark-haired sister shows up for the first time. So silly, so much fun, sweet memories ..."
4,The Shows Are Cut!,"I'm not sure about every episode, but there are cuts in the second season.""My Master The Rainmaker"" - What happened to the footage of all the rain in Alabama after Jeannie blinked and turned it into a lake?There are also some cuts in ""The Mod Party"" - the ones I noticed were after Dr. Bellows drove Tony & Roger into the woods to go hunting. Several lines of dialogue were cut, as well as a few scenes where they were trying to set up the tent."
3,I dream of a blast from the past Jeannie,"This was a great show. If you've seen one, you'll have to see them all. In this season Jeannie is seen more in the garb of the times and less in her traditional Jeannie outfit. You also get to meet her sister (Jeannie with dark hair) four times during the season. There are one or two episodes that leave you with a ""what were they thinking?"" But overall the show is a great collection to own. I bought it to introduce my son to some of the shows I watched as a kid and he seemed to like this show quite a bit (even more than ""Get Smart"" and ""Bewitched"").Although, I should warn you: My son (8) loaded it on his iPod and watched an episode on the school bus. One of the children complained to their parents he was watching an inappropriate show on his iPod with naked women. As a result I had to speak to the parents and assure the school he had nothing of the sort on his iPod. My how times have changed... but then again, maybe not."
3,Good while it lasted,"This was good for the two weeks I used it before it broke. I put a larger plate on it to weigh two unwieldy potatoes. After I removed them the needle was out of whack, and the internal mechanism stopped working. I could no longer zero the scale and it didn't read accurately. Frustrating!Too delicate for measuring anything beyond 2 cups of flour or a single potato."
3,Looks bigger than it is. But it works and no batteries,"I like it and will keep it but of course, I probably should have investigated a bit more as in the photo it seemed to me it would be larger. It isn't. But does work and no batteries. I'm happy with it."
4,A Dark Sorta Fairy Tale,This book seems a little dark for a children's book. The mice prepare for there first Mardi Gras and make masks that look like monsters and forget they are mice and become the monsters.It seems the author is really either voicing his opinion of Mardi Gras or just thought of being careful not to lose yourself in something bad or I suppose both those things.Why it is called the Greentail Mouse is because one of the mice tail gets paint on it and it never can remove the paint. A reminder that even if they forget that they were monsters once and to not to return to that way of being.I think it is a good message in general I don't know if it has to be applied to Mardi Gras as I have never participated in the event but I can see how it fits
3,"See the ""Really Painted Pictures"" at Your Library","In a take on the town mouse and the country mouse, Leonni tells the tale of happy forest mice who try to recreate a Mardi Gras celebration of their own, after hearing about it from a city mouse. This fable is, as always beautifully illustrated; although this time, there are no torn-paper mice, but, as my seven-year-old noticed, ""really painted"" pictures. However, we never find out why the mouse`s tail stays green -- as a reminder, perhaps of the dangers of trying to be what you are not? A little too ambiguous, maybe. Not as captivating as so many of his other stories. Save your money and borrow this from the library."
4,Wonderful album.,"Ms. Caram's voice is so lovely, it puts one in a state of pure bliss. The recording is excellent except that the saxophone is recorded too hot and can be a bit startling. Otherwise this is a marvelous album.The tone and light-jazz bossa feel to the music is dreamy and peaceful without putting you to sleep.The reasons for the -1 star are first the sax volume, and the second reason... I just wish she didn't sing in English for part of Fly Me to the Moon. It's less ethereal."
2,did not specify that some songs were live!,I bought this CD because it has the greatest hits. Amazon did not specify that the majority of them were live!
2,Think twice,"Well, this game is not as fantastic as the cover promises. The graphics are lousy, the magic are lousy too. The stages are difficult and frustrating. Think you have to be very paitent to finish the gaem. I've got sick of the game after reaching stage 3...."
1,This was awful,"This game looks a lot better on the cover than it actually is. The graphics are boring, you can't save until you get to a certain point, the plot is non-existent, the whole game is just confusing. I could complain forever. 3DO usually does pretty well with it's games, but not this time."
1,Really disappointing,"If you are expecting another Zelda, don't get this game. The play control is terrible, making jumps frustrating and sword fighting a mess. I have played about 30 times, and I get killed before I get anywhere. I get killed before I reach the save point, so I have to play the same dungeon over and over! Worst of all, I don't really care. Nothing I have seen so far makes me even slightly interested in making the 31st try."
5,A must-read for any fan of baseball history.,"If you have a passion for baseball history, or even a passing-interest in the subject, this is a must-read book. In 1999, most baseball teams are owned by media companies, or the mega-wealthy. This book recalls a time when an individual of modest wealth could own and operate a team. More importantly, it recounts the behind-the scenes discussions that resulted in important baseball decisions. The faithful description of what actually transpired when Judge Fuchs acquired the Braves, and when the Babe made the decision to return to Boston, transports the reader back in time. Most of all, this book describes a time when owners cared more about baseball than their own amitions. Be sure to pick up this book! Herb Crehan"
2,No ending,I was disappointed in this book. A lot of good information was written by Judge Fuchs. However after 1935 he was no longer the owner. This book doesn't explain why and how he lost the team. In one sentence it said he lost Babe Ruth and the Braves. How? Why? Does the author not want us to know the truth or the facts?Another Baseball fluff book that does not give you the hard facts. Spend your money on a better ending not this one
3,This book is an annotated index to Perry's,"Warning: This is not a textbook. Basically, they took out some of the stuff from Perry's and rewrote it more carefully and filled in some of the details. In general, this book is hard to read, missing important things, and burdened with unimportant things. It really does no justice to the quality and quantity of amazing insight inside the head of Peter Harriott (from whom I've taken classes). I can't deny that it makes an awesome reference book, but woe to any class that depends on this book."
2,Interesting thrill ride with NO ENDING,"""Breathing Room"" is a thrilling ride with a terrible conclusion. Fourteen strangers, thrown into a room together, forced to play some horrible, sadistic ""game."" Basically, it's a blending of ""Saw"" and ""Cube,"" but it still had potential. You're trying to piece it together, trying to figure out the true nature of the players... until the ending. The ending is absolutely TERRIBLE, because it MAKES NO SENSE. At the end of the film, you're left with an empty feeling that there was absolutely no point to anything you just watched. Avoid this movie at all costs."
3,Locked Door Mystery on the Cheap,"An even better comparison thanCubeorSawis the English thrillerExam, whose premise is so much like that of Breathing Room that a comparison between the two is practically a controlled experiment. I don't know if I would have enjoyed Breathing Room as much if I had not seen the other one first, so that I could appreciate how it avoids the trap of seeming like a stage play. Breathing Room is, strictly speaking, not good, with no tension, uneven performances, too much repetition, and a disappointing sputter of an ending. But still if you like puzzle movies, this one makes a gritty virtue out of its shoestring budget into and delivers the goods in a workmanlike way. Nowhere near thebestexamplesof the genre, but if you're a sucker for twists, this'll do."
4,An Exploration of Self-Myths,"Murdoch explores how people's actions are driven by their self-images and personal mythologies. The vanities, fears or ambitions that dominate the way our lives unfold vary all over the place - from the need of the protagonist to ""think well of himself,"" to the craving for love, the desire to serve humbly, or the need to forget something awful. Murdoch lets these motivations play out through her plots, which are really extravagant thought experiments. She focuses in particular on our secrets, the various reasons we have for hiding them, and the ways in which we slip into self indulgence and self-justification.Some may find this approach a bit artificial and intellectual, but I felt that although the situations might be somewhat contrived, the characters' responses and actions rang true. I found the book very readable, and it met my main criterion for a novel - it taught me something new about why people act the way they do."
4,A Good Book... Nice too.,"This book is half soap-opera and half occult-murder-mystery. I genuinly enjoyed this book.But... That's not what this review is really about! This review involves some soap-operatic (is that a word?) mystery of it's own; you are possibly reading this review as part of a wild goose-chase. Perhaps, looking for an electronic address of some kind, eh?If you concatenate my first name with the name of the animal you are chasing (including no capitalization and no spaces) you will have the address you are seeking.The host of this address (the part after the ""at"" symbol) is closely related to a search engine that was named in honor of a very large number. More precisely, the name of the host starts with a ""g"" and ends with a ""mail"" (and there's nothing in between)."
2,Over-rated,"This is my first (and possibly last) Iris Murdoch novel. Although I'm not a fan of the mystery genre, I was looking forward to reading it. The central plot involving the suicide or possible murder of a civil servant involved in black magic is surpisingly uninteresting, the pace plodding and the 'revelation' predictable. The periphary characters are heavy-handed from the all too free-spirited civil servant couple to the all too anguished Dachau survivor. The only sub-plot of interest involves an adolescent crush which also gives the book its rare suspense. The coincidentals of the plot are absurd to the point of being Dickensian and the story ties up altogether too neatly (and happily) although I did enjoy the final irony of the love-sick teenagers. I'll stick to Cormac McCarthy for my debate on good, evil and the nature of man"
3,Too Short,"King Kong has many good points. The unobstructed camera view makes you feel like you are in the movie. There's lots of creepy creatures and sounds. The graphics are great. Controls/gameplay are very solid. One of the things however that makes this game old is the repetition of finding levers to unlock doors, and finding fire to burn down grass. Apparently you're bad enough to take on oversized spiders, centapedes and mastadons yet walking through tall grass is an impossiblity. The scenes when you play Kong are pretty cool, the best of which is at the end of the game. The major complaint however is how short the game is, however shorter is probably better considering it is based on an hour and a half movie. Buy it used."
3,Can't get game to work on our xbox 360,I bought this game for my 10 yr old son who was really wanting to play this game but we couldn't get it to work on our xbox 360 for some reason. My husband tried to figure it out to get it to work and he couldn't. So if someone knows how we can get it to work so my son could play it that would be great. I know this is an older xbox game but apparently it must not work on the 360 xbox. Can't really give it a rating since he can't play it.
5,"You Mostly Play Jack, But The Game is Great!","Jack is the main character you play, and in first person, which makes the game extra cool since you get to see scenery from the movie first hand. The detail put into everything is amazing, from the island and city to the dinosaurs on Skull Island. The T-Rex especially is scary and makes me sweat with fear when it chases me every time, because it is so big and I am so small. The levels of Kong are also fun to play, especially swinging in the jungle. Too bad that you don't get to be Kong longer, but it is still fun. Overall, I say that you need this game if you don't have it already. I've had it since the year it was released and I'm still not bored. It is fun, definitely if you love the movie"
5,Just Beat It Yesterday!,"I thought King Kong was an amazing video game! It is the first video game I have ever beaten. I thought I was never going to beat it after watching some people play it and realize how past me they were when I was at the 4th level. I thought it was going to be so hard. It is not overly difficult or overly easy, unlike some other video games out there. I would totally in every single reason in the world buy this game if you have 49.99 on you some day. Totally awesome! King Kong the video game is just as astonishing as the motion picture!"
4,Yet another gmae based on a movie.,"This game is farily good, but has some warts. I mean, why are there so many doors that are missing levers? And why are the levers always in bushes? I mean, is Ubisoft trying to make me write a bad review? But, the beasts you encounter as Jack Driscoll are purely imaginative. But, after awhile, the creatures start to repeat. But, all the problems melt away when you play as the ginormus ape himself. There, you can kill giant t-rexs and bats. But, there is no point when you know he's going to die. But, there is analternative ending where Jack saves Kong. So I guess you don't feel so bad. But, the voice acting is terrible, and Jack Black looks absolutely disgusting. There, I said it. Deal with it."
2,Just an ad for the movie - horrible game,"If you actually like to play video games, avoid Kong. The enemies are repetitive and easy to kill, the weapons are pointless, and the ending is so anti-climatic it makes you feel ripped off for wasting a few hours of your life on this pile of garbage (so much so, that you will be compelled to write a review to warn your fellow gamers not to waste their money even on a rental)."
3,External Hard drive,"I expected this to be an extention of my internal hard drive. Not so, this unit is for back up only it seems and therefore is good for long term storage only"
5,half great/half good,"I love trembling blue stars. I like the intimacy of Robert Wratten's songs, accentuated by his beautiful tender voice. Of course not everyone's cup of tea. It doesn't rock much, some songs are actually very slow, but after many listening I like all the songs( except the short bonus track), unlike the other albums of TBS of which I love half and don't care about the rest. I consider him one of the best melody finder composing these days( Neil Halstead of mojave 3 is another one). I also love the arrangments and the guitars. My favorites are: until the dream gets broken, haunted days, here all day, the ghost of an unkissed kiss and St Paul's cathedral at night, I find the other songs enjoyable and interesting, so I give it 5 stars."
3,Who needs Enya?,"I had heard a few songs if Trembling Blue Star's from a friend, and thought I liked them enough to buy the album. The band doesn't lack in the talent area, however, the album, as a whole is VERY mellow. The more upbeat songs are toward the end of the album, a funny place to put them. Not to say I didn't like the album, but the fact is, when you need to rock, this album isn't your man. ""With Every Story"", ""Here All Day, and ""Maybe After All"" are the gems of the album, and Robert Wratten of Field Mice fame writes beautiful, lovelorn lyrics. Just not overall knock-your-socks-off exciting."
2,Borders on cheesy,"I enjoyed the first two songs of this CD but on song 3 a cheesy conga beat from a 20 dollar casio keyboard kicks in and it all starts going downhill. It's not as if the electronic sounds have a kitsch retro feel like Air--they just sound dated and cheap like something from an eighties Phil Collins rock ballad. He crosses the fine line between tongue-in-cheek kitsch and REAL kitsch. This would be a fine band if they got rid of some of the horrible background orchestrations. The singer has a smooth voice, the lyrics are good, and they've got nice melodies with good hooks."
3,good holsum movie,My kids love the land before time series and I think it is one of the last good movies out there for kids. They are very innocent adventures that do not deal with killing or bad guys in general. I find the series a refreshing change of pace.
5,gift for my daughter,this was bought as a gift for my daughter and it exceeds expectations. love it! will definitely purchase more in the future
4,good movie,"worth the price paid, but i must say that it is not up to the standards set by vol one of the set."
5,Land Before Time VI,"My 3 year old loves this movie and I think it's great too. It's safe, non-violent entertainment and has some great songs. You can watch this movie with your child and talk about it. Good lessons on prejudice. I heartily recommend it."
5,Computer Resources,"Back in 2000 I was in an AT class and this was one of our textbooks, needless to say things have changed in the AT world and I was so happy to find this updated version, I hope that it is upgraded again soon. I realized how full of information it really is. Easy reading not difficult for anyone."
2,nick 30,"not what i expected at all. the only thing useful for me were perhaps some of the sources, which i could mostly find online. i have chronic pain, and this book was mainly written for people who are blind, deaf, or missing fingers, etc. i wouldn't recommend it."
2,"This is actually ""Wonderful Music of...""","This is listed as ""Donovan"" but it's not. It's actually ""Wonderful Music of...Donovan"". It's a compilation of songs from various stages of his career, and unfortunately, it's got updated versions of some of the songs, which aren't as good as the originals. There are better compilations to be found."
3,"his music is great, but this album is a repeat of others","on which album can I find the music from ""brother sun and sister moon"" the zefferelli movie about st.francis of assissi made in 1973."
5,The Ultimate Reference Source for Collectors of Mysteries,"Ms. Heising has done it again! In addition to a useful tool for the mystery reader, this book is the very best source for the collector of first edition mysteries. Series are listed by date of publication, and indications are provided for those titles which have been nominated or have won major prizes in the mystery genre. No serious collector can be without this resource on their shelf for its thorough research capability (and no serious ""book scout"" can be without its counterpart Pocket Guide - available separately - for on-the-road portability). As a librarian and a collector, I believe that this is the very best work in the field. So if you are a reader who is thinking also of collecting, or a collector who also reads, don't even think about it - buy this book."
1,When will the next edition appear?,"This reference work is invaluable in finding mystery series by woman up to 1999 or so, when I bought my copy. However, it is now very much out-of-date and of little use on newer series/authors/titles. I keep checking to see if there's a Detecting Women 4, and can still hope, but possibly this one is the end of the line. What a shame!"
4,"Decent, could be better.","Overall this case does the job, keeps the ipod video pretty snug and protected in a hard plastic casing. My only complaint is how easy the hard plastic over the screen scratches. I keep my ipod in my pocket and just from the inside of the pocket there's tiny little scratches all over the screen cover. Not that big of a deal but sometimes it shows up when watching movies and the screen darkens. They could have used the glossy type plasic you see on cell phones and such to prevent scratches a bit more. Other than that, this is a nice case to protect the ipod video."
2,Fit?,"The iPod fit well in this case, however, my fm transmitter did not work but my transmitter need to be very close to the i[od, so I don't thnk it will work with any casr. My car jack also would not fit, the hole in the case was to small, the ear phone jack fit, but the car jack was slightly larger diameter. So overall the case is a nice idea, but has very limited use."
4,pretty good,"This cover works pretty well, but there was some trouble assembling it. It also makes the ipod huge once its on, so there are probably some better options out there, but this one works fine."
1,"Defective Product - Prevents use of docking station, a/v out, iTalk mic","Warning - your iPod may already be stuck! Good luck trying to get your iPod *out* of its case once it gets into it. Why, you ask, would you want to get your iPod out of this sleek looking case? Perhaps because, like me, you realize that the case's thickness prevents the use of the docking station (but not the cable by itself), Apple's A/V out cable (which goes into the headphone jack), and Griffin's iTalk voice recorder.If you only plug headphones into your iPod, then the case is great. If you have any inklings of a plan to use any accessories beyond just the headphones, avoid this case."
5,Wonderful lotion with natural scents,"This lotion is very high-quality and has a lovely natural scent. Living in a deep winter climate means that I am reliant on good moisturizers, and this hand lotion is one of the best!"
1,Phewie!!,"GHASTLY strong, unpleasant fragrance. Not at all appealing or comforting. Try to get a sample before buying."
5,Great Subscription,"This is by far the best Michigan magazine I've read. Very informative, full of high quality photos, and is ideal for when you don't have a game to watch! It keeps you updated on recruits and stats and is just full of great information that a Michigan fan craves! This Magazine makes it helpful to follow all of Michigan's sports so if you're like me and only watch their Football games, or Basketball, you can still keep up with scores and highlights of all the other sporting events you miss."
2,Too much steel!,"Well, for me, their first album was everything I could ever ask for; and the second, well, just an average bunch of songs BY COMPARISON - still wonderful, though. On the plus side, Running Wild does have some interesting tunes; but the additional instrumentation, the steel and electric guitars in particular, is really irritating. Sometimes forget to listen for Tony, it's so overwhelming. Still an amazing four acoustic musicians."
3,Perhaps too much??,"Three releases in a very short period of time. Perhaps these guys are a bit used up. For whatever reason, this one didn't hit me like the first two. As a huge fan of the performers in their individual rite, my ambivalence with this effort is surprising. Maybe with more spins it will improve for me. Not to say you might not just love it first trot."
2,Expected Much More,"I watched this film after seeing a trailer then reading these reviews, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It was pretty typical and not really that funny, save for a couple moments. The whole plot (boy/girl 'friends' who really have a thing for each other) has been done plenty of times (and much better). To compare this to 'Swingers' is riduculous, 'Swingers' is a much better film. I wouldn't waste your time with this one."
3,Bashful's DVD Summary #037,"Best:1) It has a few hilariously bawdy moments.2) You get to see the sexy (yet non-nude) body parts of Tori Spelling, Natasha Gregson-Wagner and Katharine Towne (although Carmen Electra shows nothing).3) There's a director/actors commentary track and some funny deleted scenes.Worst:1) The boy-girl friendship thing, where they awkwardly date other people before finally considering each other, is SO tired. The audience knows where the movie is going 5 minutes into the action.2) It was too much like every high-school/frat-party/losers-on-a-road trip movie ever made - except it wasn't all that funny. Sol becomes an adult only in the last 5 minutes of the movie and THEN only to justify that last kiss with his new girlfriend.Recomendation:Get this one cheap (used) or rent it instead of paying full retail. It's funny, sexy and outrageous - but not enough of either to make this one memorable as a great comedy."
4,Funny...,Suspend your filter for old-hand romance comedy genre tricks and this movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing. It's as sharp a portrayal of the LA Singles TwentySomething scene in 2000 as Swingers was for 1995. Laughing so hard at unexpected moments (try the DELETED SCENES section) made me giggle for days after. Why this movie wasn't better promoted is beyond me... I had to hear about it from a friend. I suspect SOL GOODE will go on to cult favorite status. Until then it's one of the best kept comedy secrets.
2,don't be fooled,"This is the 6086, and it says it works with distributorless ignitions. Maybe. Not for me.The 6068 (larger diameter) is the one that really WILL work with any engine. It has an inductive pickup that goes around the spark plug wire. That's the one that actually worked in my 2006 Dodge Caravan. It's bigger and more expensive, but no one makes a 2"" tach with an inductive pickup anymore (at least none I could find).Equus' website for the 6086 SAYS it has an inductive pickup, but IT DOES NOT. It has a wire to connect to your vehicle's tach output port, which many vehicles don't have. In Dodge Caravans, for example, the 6086 WILL NOT WORK."
5,Volcanic samba,"Tania Maria was set to be a concert pianist, but tired of playing other people's music. She has always been on her own, never a sideman, and this double CD presents her at her peak in the early 80-ies. Two tracks stand out: Superhappy and Tranquility. Her support by 2-3 Brazilian percussionists is positively earboggling.Her singing in synch with her pianoimprovisations is superior to anything I have heard of its kind.This is not bossa nova, it's samba nova!"
4,Excellent !! ....Just one problem,"As all ""Illustrated Buyer Guides"" so is this one a top notch resource for the numbers and detail guy or gal. One problem is that the version is getting outdated. Covers only up to the 1998 production year. Now that the f-body died, why not update it one more time for all enthusiasts. otherwise great book !!!"
1,This is NOT the movie (of the same name) with Betty Grable!,"The very fine movie entitled ""Springtime In The Rockies"" with Betty Grable and John Payne is *NOT* available on DVD at this time.Same name, different movie. This is a Western, not a Musical."
1,Enlightened?,"What Joe Kennedy did was to take a reportedly shy and mildly retarded woman (or so they claimed) and obliterate her humanity with a lobotomy. The reason is reported to be that she was considered an embarassment and a potential roadblock to Kennedy political ambitions.It was a ""failed"" lobotomy, the reports frequently say. What would constitute a successful lobotomy? The Kennedys have spent the subsequent decades promoting psychiatric tortures and coercive mistreatments of millions of other Americans who have ended up in the clutches of the ""mental health community."" In short, their ""philanthropy"" is one of support for violence and torture. For this they are feted as humanitarians by apologists such as this author."
1,JUNK,very scetchy..but what u expect for 18.00 cnt use thesegood sound when u get sound from them ...very in n out sound
1,Terrible,It didn't work. I plugged it in and it didn't turn on. Terrible purchase. Do not spend your money on this item
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,Bought this to go with a Karaoke system that Santa brought my daughter. One microphone works half the time the other one makes a great paper weight. DO NOT BUY
5,Naxa Professional Dual Wireless Microphone Kit,"I'm in love with this unit. I bought 2 sets, one for me and one for my nephew. Since January 17, 2012 both sets work perfectly so far. We even tried to use them all four together with our ""base"", 3 worked very good and one was silent till they took it back to the ""mother base"".In short: unit is nice, quite solid made and with decent design. Sound is clear, especially if you stay far from speakers. Microphones works fine at a distance of 22 feet (7 meters), it was enough for my kind of karaoke in my small apartment :)) And the greatest thing is the price I gave - $20.97 for each.Also the seller company - they are perfect, I received 1st set a little bit later than they predicted, later I learnt that it was caused by ""postmen"", but second came really as scheduled. I would recommend them to all of you."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"OK, the quality is lousy, but what do you want for 18 bucks? I won't use them for gigs, but they work pretty well through my little mixer for computer recording, and I don't have to get the good mics out. I saved $8 in shipping by ordering them and they ARE worth the $7 they actually cost me."
1,Piece of Junk,"I should have listened to the reviews of this thing. Very poor quality, cheaply made. The electric plug did not work, it was just 2 pieces of metal stuck in plastic. It broke trying to get it to make contact. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!"
1,Terrible product don't waste your money,"I thought well $16 what do I got to lose, the answer is $16 total waste of money. Awful quality, terrible feedback is ever couple seconds, unbearable. Don't buy this"
1,Do not buy these. Save your money.,"Where to begin?Trying to get the mics to work was incredibly difficult. The instructions were not written by a human. I couldn't understand any of it. There were typos all over the place and misspelled words throughout. After getting one microphone to work, the sound quality was so terrible, it was actually funny. The second mic did not work. There was nothing I could do about it. It was just simply broken. As soon as you turn on the unit, static fills the room. You cannot hear your voice through the static. If you do, it's only about 1/16 of what you actually said. I would have expected a product with this low of quality from the dollar store."
1,Pass on this,"Bought this for the low price...after 5.5 decades on this planet I should have learned ""You get what you paid for"". Removed the receiver unit from the box and attempted to adjust antennaes from shipping to upright position.""Snap"" was heard and the antenna just flopped over. With super glue and a day of rest was able to gingerly adjust antennae.Cheap plastic microphones will only work in direct line-of-sight of receiver. Holding the microphone perfectly still while you sing almost worked. Intermittant loud crackling and constant humming spoils your songs. I changed battery and plastic end cap broke .. now held together with superglue and duct tape. I spent more repairing than using...Unit is now in the ""Hall of Shame"" box in my garage. Save your money for a different brand. Nix the NAXA."
2,Never been used,"I have never used these nor do I intend to. I bought them as a prop for a play I am doing, for $18.16 great price for two prop mics cheaper than going to Radio Shack"
3,Good for the price,We bought these for our daughters to add to their karaoke machine. This is the second one of these we have bought after the antennas broke off the first one. My only complaint is that when I went to put the battery in the microphone the contacts were rusted. Seemed odd to me that it would be that way. They work for the most part although the antennas have to be up and the cord to the outlet is not long enough.
2,aight,"It alright for something cheap, bought for my father! Planning on buying a new and more durable one in the near future!!!"
2,Microphone,"Got what I paid for, not worth the hassel sending back for $20... The first night it was used, I set the red microphone down on the table and it has not worked since... Green one works sometimes have to play with the on off switch. But when it did work, it worked great and I could be about 70 feet away from the wireless device with the microphones which was great! You have to speak directly into the mic not from an angle... Will have to upgrade! I do need to thanks Naxa Electronics for helping me realize I need a better quality product."
1,WORST MICROPHONE EVER!!,"I strongly suggest not to buy this product because for 1 these are terrible sounding and for 2 they are cheep looking. Im disappointed in this product they could have done a lot better for what they call a ""Professional Microphone"". Im curious on what their non professional microphone sounds like...?"
1,Returned,I had to return this product as it didn't work right out of the box. There was a constant crackling noise in the background even when they were not switched on. With RF products you get what you pay for. I may have to go with a traditional wired mic instead. Sad this kit didn't work out.
1,Microphone not working,"Dear Si/Madam,the Wireless Microphone did not even turned on and is not working.I havent used it yet but the first time i tried it the Power wont come on.I dont know what`s wrong with it.Could you please make an exchange to a good and better one that works,Thank you for your time."
3,It's OK,"The microphones are so simple to hook up to your stero system or any thing else you have to hook it up to. The microphones looks are sharp however, most of the time when I turn the microphone on it makes a loud static noise then allows you to talk. As for sound clarity its pretty bad you can hear static in the backround and range is not to far. For a begining DJ it would be good for it's price but for a professional DJ I would not recomende it."
1,looks good in picture,"i tried this product, it looks good but it didn't perform to well. there was static even up close to the reciver.better luck next time. i guess for the price i shouldn't have epected much."
4,ok,It's pretty good for the price. Works good for Karaoke. Just don't drop them they break very easy and not very much range.
1,poor quality,these are great for a one time use but don't expect too much out of these mics. they have poor quality. The best mics to get for any singing etc are UHF mics.
1,JUNK!!!!,dont wast your time and money on these. They are JUNK. Will not connect to base unit. After lookin into it more I found out there is no transmitter inside the mic. TOTAL JUNK AND SCAM
3,Smelly smelly,"I needed this for speeches at a wedding. The mic kit works OK, the volume signal is on the low side and when it's turned up through an amp there is hissing as others have mentioned, but upping the treble on the amp made the hissing barely audible. Unrelated to its main function but rather disturbing is that the base station had a very strong chemical smell. I unscrewed the bottom to open it up and found the source to be a waxy substance on the circuit board. I had to air it out opened up by the window for 24hrs to get rid of the smell."
1,cheaply made,the item had no quality feel to it would not recomend felt cheaply made the sound was tinny and the battery compartment broke before I had a chance to test it
1,manual?,"Wow, you guys got a manual with yours? I didn't :-(well I haven't tried it yet since no batteries came with it. Good thing I actually have another mic then huh?"
3,get what you pay for,i would have to say they are fine for the price but they are chincy really light plastic feeling i am def. going to buy some better ones
3,"It's a cheap fun toy, Not proffesional.","I give these 3 stars because they are exactly what they are, A TOY. These are good for what I bought them for. I purchased these for use in my living room, with a karaoke setup. They work good for that, because in my small living room you don't need a lot of volume. They have a noisy hiss at high volume. Also, one of the has a very loud buzz, unless the other is turned on. It's weird. But none the less, they work and for the price you can't expect much."
1,Do not buy this product,Only one of the microphones worked for about 1 week.The second one works only when I am at a weird Angle in front of the base.Do not buy this product!
4,"For the money, it's pretty darn good!","Ok, so it's not the best wireless microphone. But I paid a total of $24 which includes shipping. Two wireless microphones for $24 is great. The hissing sound can be bothersome at times, but it's not really distracting. You do get a few interferences here and there, but it's only once in a while. It's not perfect, but it performs well for the money.And like a previous reviewer said, beware of the instruction manual. It's a disgrace. The grammar is horrible and there are tons of typos. Whoever wrote that needs to go for writing lessons really badly.Overall, it's worth the money. If you're looking for something perfect, you might want to save up for something better."
1,Cheap price--cheap sound,Terrible quality--an easily audible background hisssssss is pretty annoying. Planning to buy a new one soon.
1,juan,"very disappointed at this buy. well to start one of the microphones (red) did not work. so im stuck with only one, although i paid for two. sound is very low therefore you will need to connect it to an amplifier with high volume. afterall, i couldnt expect this to be a professional microphone for the low price, but at least i could of had both microphones working. save your money and buy something better."
3,Exactly what you're paying for,"If you're expecting a spectacular product you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something adequate for small venues and no need for great sound, this is for you."
2,naxa-984 karaoke,"I purhcased this product new, except it did not come with instructions, I paid $13.99 I got v 9 battereis for each microphone and pulled it all up and attached it to my am fm stero, the radio sounds stopped and the lites were on the microphones and I sopke into the microphones but no sounds came out, so I may take them back because they are not working to me...Yolanda... is compton ca."
5,best bang for the buck,I used this product to teach country line dancing to my daughters school. I hooked it up to my kaoroke machine and the microphones were wonderful. I could be heard over a whole gym of screaming kids. Great product. I purchased two - one for my daughter and her friends to play with and one for me.
3,Cheap for a Reason PEOPLE!!!,"This product is cheap for a reason people. My mics work fine and I've had them for a minute... I don't know what a ""Real Mic"" is suppose to feel like but it does everything that ones on tv do. Its pretty cool for the price. It's crazy how these reviewers pay low prices for something and complain when something is wrong with it. Didn't nobody force you guys to buy the product. You shuld have known by the price. This mic is for a toddler or someone like me who just wanted a cheap one... I like it... It's cool... For the price!!"
3,A lot for a little,"I found this item to work great. It is very cost effective, and I love that. However, the battery drainage is unbelievable! Even with rechargeable batteries the drainage is ridiculous."
1,Junk,One of the microphones dd not work out of the box. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. Spend a few dollars more and get something better.
1,traveling dj,"theses have tons of static, terrible quality in all waysit is made out of the cheapest plastic everspent the extra and but something worth your time!"
1,very bad,All i have to say is buy 1 mic with the cord this only goes 5 feet away from the mixer. Very bad product Dont buy.
1,Totally disappointed with this product,"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my aunt. Voice drops in and out. Cord of receiver is too short. There is constantly a static. Even for this price, it was a waste."
2,WILL NOT LAST LONG,"I USED THESE MICROPHONES WHILE DJING AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY, AND AT FIRST THEY WERE GREAT. THEN AFTER ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES ONE MIC WAS DROPPED AND THE BOTTOM PORTION SHATTERED. THE MIC IS VERY LIGHT WIEGHT AND FEELS LIKE ITS MADE FOR KIDS. THE SOUND WAS EXCELLENT, BUT THE MICROPHONE ITSELF WILL PROPABLY HAVE A VERY SHORT LIFE SPAN, BECAUSE MICS ARE DROPPED ALL THE TIME. MY ADVICE IS SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND TRY ANOTHER."
1,awful,"worst microphone I've ever used. lots of noise, loss of signal within feet of the receiver. had to order new microphones same day. yes it's cheap so I don't expect nearly as much... but cheap trash is still trash.update:ended up buying this: Nady DKW Duo VHF Handheld Wireless Microphone System and it was worlds better and still very affordable."
1,I do not recommend,I do not recommend buying these mics because they are of very poor quality and malfunctions. do not throw your money because they buy and the two only one works very hard and bad sound. Find something more than money and buy something of better quality.
2,When it whalnts to,My bigest complaint with these mikes Thay dont hardly have eny line out power when you turn the mixing board up all the way and half of the time the mike act like the battery is dead and Thay are new As far as the range Dont plan on walking very far with these Things But when Thay work Thay are fairly nice But Look at the cost of the shipping It is more then the mikes
1,Worst sound quality ever,Only 1 of the 2 work. And by far the worst sounding mics I've ever owned. Have had better sound out 8 dollar corded mics
5,Excellent,"This is one of the greatest CDs I own. The songs, performances and production values are all excellent. I wish they would re-release this because my copy has a scratch."
2,Quirky early Bowie,"As a modest Bowie fan I already owned a best of collection and ""Aladdin Sane"" when I heard ""Please Mr. Gravedigger"" on the radio. It was the twisted sentimentality and sinister narrative of this song that attracted me to this first Bowie album. ""Please Mr. Gravedigger"" is, without doubt, the stand out track here. The album as a whole does not seem to have worn well with the years, sounding like a novelty recording - dated and quaint."
5,"See ""The Deram Anthology""","This is half of ""The Deram Anthology"", and ""The Deram Anthology"" is the ""laser disc"" equivalent of the ""Images"" vinyl disc set with additional tracks ""Ching-a-ling"" and an alternate version of ""Space Oddity"". I like the ""David Bowie"" songs very much, but rather than recommend you buy it, I prefer to direct your attention to ""The Deram Anthology"" (compare prices). (And while I'm recommending things there is also the Proclaimers's ""This is the Story"", a first album, and ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"", a method book.)"
2,Anoraks only need apply,"David Bowie is a great brand, and it shifts lots of CDs. This is because of a terrifically fertile creative period David Bowie the artiste weathered in the 1970s, all of which was captured in Glorious Stereo by the good folk at RCA, but none of which is represented here. This, instead, is the godawful ""Deram"" material of the 1960s - which a young and outwardly talentless Davy Jones recorded between leaving school and discovering the Dylan perm. Irrespective of what any of the revisionists say, it is simply not any good. This doesn't stop Decca valiantly trying to flog it off every six months in a different package, of course, a practice they have maintained unstintingly since about 1984."
4,This is a Must Read,"Michael Soulek nails it on the head - great wisdom and advice for the executive transitioning in their career as well the person looking for something deeper in their work/life balance..Reading this book will plant many seeds of success, inspire and motivate the reader.This is a must read for every business person, no matter what position they hold in a company."
4,Something for everyone,"Andy and some of his Roxy Music pals enjoy themselves here with a romp through a variety of music styles; classical, country, rock and pop amongst others with a mix of his own compositions and covers.One of my favourite albums. I wore out two vinyl copies before getting the CD version.It sounds like they had a lot of fun making this record and it gives a lot of pleasure to listen to it."
5,"a great, esoteric album","I wore out my vinyl import also. This album is so eclectic, from Schubert to Skeeter Davis. It's avant guarde and warm at the same time, just a very cool record. In hindsight, Andy was the best thing about Roxy Music."
5,Child Guidance and the School by Isabella Clark MacLean,"The Material in this book is gleaned largely from experience of working in the field of child guidance for over twenty-five years, and represents conclusions reached from the study of many thousands of individual cases.It is difficult to generalize, as no two children and no two backgrounds are alike. Clinical judgments based on years of experience are, however, useful means whereby light can be thrown on the nature of problems facing children in the process of growing up. Many statements, although requiring to be taken on trust by the reader, can nevertheless be substantiated from clinic files and from the study of actual cases, handled in a large and combined school psychological and child guidance service."
5,"Upbeat, fun and great to dance to!",Powerful rhythms and themes which go right to the roots of Puerto Rico music. Great solos by Yomo Toro on quatro. Has been a favorite of mine for over a year now.
5,"Yolandita Monge, Mi Encuentro, absolutely terrific CD","In this CD Mi Encuentro Yolandita Monge gives another meaning to the interpretation of the plena and bomba. I greatly enjoy this CD because once again she demonstrates that she is the best singer we have because she can sing any rythym with such feeling that keeps you singing and dancing with her. I encourage people who will like to become familiar with the island, Puerto Rico, cultural music to purchase this CD that they will not regret it."
5,As good as it get's,"Okay let me start off by saying that I don actually own one of these yet, but I will. I used a neighbors and it was awesome. This baby has it all! Sure you can spend thousands more on stainless steel BBQ monsters, but you'll never be disappointed with a Weber. Most Weber's in the Gold, Silver and Platinum series perform well and have good features, but the storage, style and BTU give the Genesis Platinum my vote!Happy BBQ"
1,"BIG and great features, but poor performer.","This has been trouble from the get-go. We've used it for less than a season and it has been very unreliable -- doesn't heat evenly, cooking times do not correspond to what's written in the manual, often requires numerous complicated procedures to get lit. We previously owned a smaller Weber Genesis grill for 15 years and had no problems. Apart from the nice big cooking and storage spaces and the side burner for heating sauces, this big grill has been nothing but a BIG waste of money."
1,APC was supposed to be the standard?,"I own this product. I have it only to supply power for 30 seconds until my generator kicks in. I had way less than the load plugged into it, yet every time I got a brownout, this unit would beep and all devices (including computer & switch) would go offline and stay off until I reset the UPS. Worst part was that any devices NOT plugged in to the unit were usually fine in these situations! What's the point in the unit? I tried 2 or 3 different APC units with the same results until finally I found a comparable Belkin unit that (surprisingly) has been MUCH more reliable."
1,NOT THE LITTLE MERMAID BY DISNEY,This was an amazingly stupid rent. my kids were disappointed and didnt watch more than 10 minutes. dont do it!
1,Don't waste your money,"This is probably the worst film I've ever seen! Poor quality and just poor film all together. My daughter, who loves mermaids, didn't even give it 2 minutes before saying she wanted to watch something else. Please don't waste your money."
2,A little frightening,"We rented this movie thinking it was ""Disney's Little Mermaid."" There are some scenes in the film that frightened my 5 year old. They only watched it once..."
1,Wasn't the version we thought,We purchased this thinking it was the Disney and it wasn't. We only watched 5 minutes and turned it off. Couldn't return it
1,Disappointed,"Not what we thought! We were looking for the Disney movie ""The Little Mermaid"" The characters are different than the Disney movie !"
1,False advertising,"I expected Disney's Little Mermaid and got this weaker version. If it had been an amazing animation, I would have been happy, but the animation was just so so and the story was different."
2,Not the real deal,"I wish I wouldn't have purchased this. I thought it was the most recent version but, this movie was probably made in the 70s when I was a kid. :)"
1,NOT THE DISNEY MOVIE!!!,Rented this through my Roku so my sick little girl could watch. Roku doesn't show reviews or I would have realized it was crap. Amazon shouldn't even have this piece of junk movie.
4,Brenda Song rocks,"For those who laugh with London, the heiress to the Tipton Hotel at Zack and Cody, this DVD will be a surprise. The story reveals another facet of the actress. Cute, not boring at all. I saw it with my nine-year-old girl."
2,cheesy and phony,"4 screenwriters came up with such bad screenplay? what kind age range disney targeted this time? teenage over 11 years old didn't like it, parental adults had to bite the bullet to co-watch it with their children, from age 6 to 10, maybe? or this was just for the purpose to sell more sound tracks of this childish movie?"
3,A bit disappointing,"It's very rough for a kids' movie. I though Read It and Weep was much better storyline and a more detailed sypnosis. Anyway, I think Shin Koyomada's character, Shen, was a bit weird. He had been living for about a thousand years or so! Weird...!These are my favorite DCOMs:1. High School Musical (Now on DVD)2. The Cheetah Girls 2 (Coming to DVD this December)3. The Color of Friendship (Now on VHS)4. Read It And Weep (Coming to DVD this November)5. Cow Belles (Now On DVD)6. The Thirteenth Year (Currently Unavailible on VHS)7. Now You See It... (Coming Soon to DVD)8. Kim Possible: So The Drama (Now on DVD)9. Twitches (On DVD September 5th)10. The Cheetah Girls (Now On DVD)"
1,What are they thinking?,"The first review is true- I saw this movie on Tv and didn't know disney would be stupid eenough to put it on Dvd. Some movies like twitches and Cow belles and High School musical and the cheetahs are better that this one-ridicolous! Most of the movie Is NO DIAlouge! jUST FIGHTING WHICH IS EXTREMELY BORING TO WTACH. It's funny though to wtach it andlaugh at it.A money waste. Buy twitches instead. I think it rocks. Jumbled story, poor martial arts-all in all what looks like a last minute lowbudget-thrown together messily film. No haertwraming content or momets you'll rmember. No significance. Dreadful.What raelly is surprising is that their next movie that was a DCOM sucked too! Let's hope it dosen't get worse, disney. Get a clue. Mark my words. Do not buy Wendy wu. Cheesey cheesier."
1,DIE WENDY WU!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wendy wu completlry stinks. The story is dredfulbecause there isn't one! Die wendy wu! Brenda song let everyone down-this is sooo bad! Die wnedy wu! DIEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The story: WEndy wu is a prima donna who is desprate to be homecoming queen. Now a ponytailed freak for bhudda temple in wherever comes syaing that it is wendy's time to defaet a viliian an d forget the homecomingThe cheese: it's cheesey because the villian is extremely weak and passes a sgreen gas form one person to the other-possessing the person it's in. SCARY FOR YOUNG KIDS EVEN! iT even enters the DOG- LAME! Also, martial arts masters posses the bodies of four teachers which is feaky and confusing. A lot of the movie has no worgs or story-it's all about fighting and ridcolous stunts- tae kwan do and stuff but it's overly dramatic and you can almost see the strings attached to wendy as she flys. Bad bad bad."
4,One of the best from disney channel,"brenda song is one of my favorite actor's from disney channel.If you love Brenda song or love a good kung fu movie,this is for you"
4,Wendy Becomes a Warrior!,"It turns out it was sort of not like I had expected. I mean, Wendy never really fought another girl, but a male villian in a girl's body! Still, this movie is quite good.This movie's about a popular teen who starts to learn that she's a Yin warrior and must train her martial arts skills to defeat a non-mythical creature, Yan-Lo. Yan-Lo keeps going from body to body, searching for this soon-to-be warrior!So, I give this movie 4 stars. It's probably not the best Disney Channel movie, (like ""Read it and Weep,"") but let's see how you'll like it!"
3,It Was Okay,"Problaby not the best, but it was pretty good. But I bet that when you very first saw the preview of this new movie, you problaby thought that it was an actual ""Girl vs. Girl"" scene, right? That's what I thought! And me and my cousin completly agree that it would have been better if that happened, 'cause sometimes she says, ""It would be better if she fighted a real girl""!"
5,Leslie Sansone: Walk Away the Pounds - 5 Day Fit Walk,"Work at your pace, easy to follow, and worth the money. Really enjoy using this program. What a great find."
4,Great DVD,Leslie Sansone has made a great DVD with this 5-day fit-walk. She has a great way of making you feel that she's a good friend whose just called around to your home to work out with you! It varies well from day to day so one never gets bored with the same routine. Found the music harder to hear in the background and not as good as in the 3-mile Walk your Belly Flat DVD. Loved the kick-boxing part.
2,What happen Leslie?,"I love Leslie Sansone's walk exercise programs and I have about 4 DVD's. This is the worst. The music is too low to the point you can barely hear it. Everyone seems like they are off beat. I can't even watch them while they move because it throws off my workout. Because you are basically doing the same moves for every workout I think the music should be good and loud enough to hear as well as the people should be on beat. I am in the process of trying to get rid of it via ebay, so if you want it for cheap, check out ebay later this week."
5,the best band,"Back in the 80's the scorpions were not my favorite band, but i picked up this cd mainly for the bargain price- and was totally blown away! They have an awesome sound, the songs are all catchy and the level of musicanship is very high. I only regret not giving them a chance before. Pick up this album! It's a must have."
5,Incredible,"I sat an read this book cover to cover in one sitting, it was that good. D.L. Sparks makes her characters come to life I felt like I was watching it on the big screen. AWESOME!!!"
5,wow,I was just thummin' through some free downloads when I ran into this cd and thought I would give it a try. thinking nothing of it I started playing them. after listening to the samples rour times I decied to get it for myself. the songs are equally catchy up deat and addicitve. the banjo is a beautiful insterment which the cd contains a lot of is old time sound. if you like bluegrass your collection wont be complete without this cd I imagin the frist one is just as good.
1,A Hurried Collection,O' Brother was put together with great care. There are great artists here - this is not their best work! A rush for the buck!
5,Wonderful collection,"Although I am neither an expert on Bluegrass nor on women performing Bluegrass music I like this record very much. It gives an overview on Bluegrass played by women which is excellent for beginners who have no idea about that kind of music. If you hate what some people might call ""Hill-Bill"" music don't buy it. But if you like Bluegrass you will enjoy it.How can one not enjoy Rhonda Vincent or Laura Lewis?"
3,Lacks the Cohesion of her Brother,"The collection of songs on ""O Brother"" was made very deliberately, with a wonderful ear toward a ""comprehensive"" overall sound. But there was no such brilliant and strong guiding force at work for ""O Sister"", which is essentially a compilation of various female Rounder artistes.Don't get me wrong - I like many of the songs included here, but they don't always blend together in the best way.I haven't yet heard a superb compliation collection of female bluegrass artistes, but if you want to hear an excellent and cohesive collection of Rounder artists, buy the 2-CD ""Hand Picked: 25 Years of Bluegrass""."
4,a Rounder sampler,"This is essentially a sampler album of female bluegrass artists with Rounder Records. Like all sampler albums it lacks overall coherence, but like all good sampler albums it is a great way to discover artists new to you. Few record labels could pull this off well, but Rounder has the catalog with enough depth to do it. If you like bluegrass (and who doesn't?) and you like female vocalists then this album is well worth owning."
1,Not very interesting...,"Like the reader from Walnut Creek says, this book is essentially a weight training book, and frankly, not a very interesting, thorough, or original one. I was sorely disappointed. There was really no information that hasn't already been published a hundred times before in a hundred other similar books and magazines. Nothing cutting edge or inspiring or anything that makes you stop and think, wow, now that's a good idea, I can't wait to try that. I've enjoyed some of Staley's writings in the magazines and on his website, but this was just a real let down."
5,Super Fun Stackers,"We purchased these stacking cups along with another set by another company. We have owned these for over a year and our toddler still plays with these. They are colorful, but most important they are all a diferent size to actually teach stacking!!! Great product!"
3,Young Jazz Guns' Dave Festival,"This disc will be attractive for those interested in contemporary jazz players or fusion of jazz and international music or, of course, Dave Brubeck. I was attracted as this cd included the name Bill Frisell (He is my favorite and so is 'Summer Song' ) and Dave Douglas. The musics are nice when you sit on the corner of cafe in Paris or walking around maze of paths in Venice. Scene changes."
2,Average at best...,"We were able to borrow this DVD from our local Family Video for free. I was plenty disappointed with the quality of the it. The stories were not clever (even confusing) and the animation was unimpressive.We rented this for our 2 and 3 1/2 year olds who were mildly amused for maybe half of one episode.The worst VeggieTales video was better than this for Bible lessons, animation, and quality of the writing.Two of the episodes deal with a nightmare and a severe thunderstorm. It was more intense subject matter than we'd prefer.I don't recommend this DVD. When I turned it off in the middle of the show and asked if they wanted to watch ""Franklin the Turtle"" they both cheered and my three year old said, ""That one was kind of scary."""
4,No labels.,"Kind of bummed, I didn't buy this to play, I bought it to hot glue onto a trophy for a gaming tournament. I couldn't use it because it didn't even have the stickers with the game title on it. It just looked like a black square. When there is no label, shouldn't they tell you that?"
5,"Oh, Langhorne!",His songwriting is just as impressive as his performance . . . Langhorne is SUCH a good time!
1,Consider the source...,"When you read Carrell's books consider who he is/was. His real name is Paul Schmidt. He was a chief spokesman to the press for the National Socialist Foreign Ministry and worked for the Nazi propaganda magazine ""Signal"". He was a Nazi before they came to power and eventually was a member of the SS. Although he didn't see combat."
1,"BE CAREFUL: ""Hitler Moves East, 1941-43: A Graphic Chronicle""","ATENTION!!! BE CAREFUL: ""Hitler Moves East, 1941-43: A Graphic Chronicle"" is an artwork book that consists of photos of toy soldiers and toy tanks, it is by Levinthal and Trudeau who STOLE the TITLE to Carrell's history book ""Hitler Moves East, 1941-43""!!"
5,AMBIANCE IS EVERYTHING!!,"As you might put romantic music on when entertaining a prospective mate for the evening, so it is the same when sharing your thoughts with the Devine. This experience was different for me in that the affect of the the cd created the environment for limitless spiritual possibilities while I found a new spiritual component in everyday surroundings. This cd can also be used to created blissful visiualisations. For those who believe in God, finally a rendition of what He might want us to put on during a chat/prayer session with Him. Explore, create and allow the other side of your brain to feel the freedom as well as the force."
1,"great music, really bad quality of recording","Put it on a maximum volume and can barely hear the sounds, either the download or the recording itself is not good, can U put a different copy? Hoping to play it during savasana in my yoga classes."
5,excellent cd,"i've seen the movie, and it is really good. the movie is what inspired me to buy the soundtrack. i went out and bought the soundtrack and i was not disappointed at all. the songs have a nice slow rhythm. you can feel very comfortable listening to it. i am stuck on the song ""4th of july""."
2,No Vocals???,"Where are the songs with vocals??Forget the ""new age"" crap, the beautiful female vocal I heard during the credits is nowhere to be found.Oh well, ""new age"" = ""pointless""... at least musically.J"
5,"Fantastic, enchanting...really resonates on a deep level","It's hard to describe the way this music made me feel, so I'll sum up by saying it's an excellent score for an excellent movie. It's unlike any other kind of music I know, and hard to categorize; it makes you feel innocent and introspective at the same time, makes you forget all the world's woes for a short time and refreshes your outlook on life."
5,The Best,"Edward Shearmur is great. He is a young talented artist who has once again created a gem, a diamond this time. This is the best CD I have ever listened to. It's wonderful for removing yourself from your mind for a few minutes. I listen to it while driving on the highway and it's so relaxing, it has a sort of ambient techno-quality to it. It is also great to fall asleep to. If anyone likes Moby they would appreciate this soundtrack.This is similar to The Fog of War, where the movie would not have been as fantastically defined if it weren't for the life-changing soundtrack by Phillip Glass. From the start of this movie it was apparent that this soundtrack alone would make this movie memorable, and it did.Highly Recommended, to all."
4,"answer for ""preaching to the choir"" question","Though the song for the credits did not make the cut for the soundtrack, it is still availible to the public. The artist is Sheryl Crow. The album is ""C'mon C'mon"". The song title is ""Safe and Sound"". Hope this is helpful to any and all who enjoyed this stirring music!"
1,Where's the beef?,"Just saw the movie (fantastic - loved it), and was excited to hear Sheryl Crow doing the closing number. BUT WHY ISN'T IT ON THE SOUNDTRACK? Sure, the rest of the music is O.K. too, but if you're a Sheryl fan, you want this tune. A real shame it's not included on the CD. Oh well, hopefully it will appear on her next album (if she ever gets around to releasing it!)."
1,painfully inappropriate score,"I am not one to describe any music as ""bad"", but this score was terrible for this film. It did not fit the film whatsoever, whether you are trying to convey the touching, sentimental side of the film's message, or the more appropriate science fiction aspect. The music might conceivably be enjoyable out of the context of the movie, if you really wanted to put on music that makes you forget music is on.I'm no film composer, and kind of just felt like being critical this evening, but I just watched the movie and felt the music detracted from the story and the mood."
2,Buy the Book!,This CD is no more than a simple reading of the official rules of the road with often irrelevant stock footage for eye candy. Buy the book!
4,adequate tool for occasional use,"Basic, no-frills caliper. Works wells but wouldn't recommend for prolonged use. The sharp linear edges can take its toll on your hands during long duration or frequent use. On the positive side, I like not having to deal with batteries. This is the type of caliber I used as a teenager and I don't see any need for digital displays that simply add to the price and inconvenience while not improving on the inherent functionality of such a tool.Joe"
3,Hard to Read,"This is a stamped metal tool. It does have a tenth of a millimeter interpolation scale, but on the one I got the markings are so faint that you better have your magnifying glasses on to read it. I think I could get just as accurate a measurement using a ruler. I'll keep it, but it will mostly be relegated to the toolbox."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,La Mer Lip Balm costs $45 at retail stores. dont pay these fools the money they are asking. this is an AMAZING product at a horrible price. you could buy 2 or 3 for the price these thieves are asking.
3,Passable Lip Balm With A Hefty Price Tag,"Although it lives up to it's hype, it is what it is - A LIP BALM! It moisturizes lips. It smells amazing (think Andes Mint). It lasts (I've been using this for 5 years and have purchased a total of 2 lip balms in all). The texture and consistency is amazing. It is non-irritating. It does not, however, have the same anti-aging benefits that La Mer is known for. It offers no 'miraculous' effects, not even sun protection. Your lips will not look younger even after years of use. You have to dip your finger(s) into the pot which to me is an inconvenience (read unhygenic). But overall, it is a good albeit pricey lip balm - nothing more.The main reason I love it is simple because it's La Mer. Just like Chanel is to handbags or Patek Philippe is to watches. Bottom line is, if you don't mind at all spending $50+++ for a lip balm then by all means this a great staple. Otherwise, just save your hard-earned moolah or spend the $$$$$ on something else."
2,Speed kills,This has to be the most frustrating out of the Prince of persia series. The game itself can get to you performing a speed kill on your enemys is so annoying the long jumps the health up grades. I found my self yelling and curing at the tv when i did not do a speed kill right timing is every thing. I hope the new prince of persia game is great not frustrating to play i hope it is better than the rest of the prince of persia games out there.
2,Boring Gameplay/Strategy,"I must agree with others on here who gave it a bad review. The game play design is atrocious. I spent hours trying to get him to go over walls and jump zig zag across pits. And even if he falls a few feet, he dies. Isn't the point of a supernatural hero supposed to be they are a *little* more durable than regular mortals? I've gone back to playing God of War over again instead of messing with this anymore."
4,it was good but it could have been better,"i really enjoyed this game but its only fun to pass it like two times.i passed it for the first time in like ten hours!!!!i was very dissapointed how short this game was the second prince of persia game was much MUCH longer.Now the pros of this game:it is really fun to play as the dark prince and the new stealth kills really puts something new for the game and the chariot racing was amazing but there are alot more cons.the cons:the graphics seemed to get worse and the game looks alot worse,it was a short game,the final boss was very easy and you cant choose which prince gets to suceed(you know what i mean if you own the game)i really dont know why the game is mature because there isnt intense violence not alot of blood and no nudity!!!!overall the game is good stuff but you should wait till is a lower price"
5,Best Game of the Year,"Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones deserves five stars: as expected, the graphics, gameplay, and storyline are all great and more than what you would expect from most other games. Some parts of the game remind you of the first two in the trilogy, but there are also some new gameplay added into it, such as the Speed Kill system and chariot races. In my opinion, PoP: TTT is definitely one of the best games of the year, and I think that all fans of the series would agree."
4,Great with some detracting flaws,"This game has excellent and innovative game play if not for some flaws:1. It is too difficult about mid-way through2. Never developed online playThe graphics and gameplay are really excellent otherwise. Hopefully, the nnext gen version for PS3 will have online and be a bit more forgiving."
2,Couldn't stand it.,I sold this game quick and in a hurry. It was the first prince of Persia game Id ever played so I wasn't real sure what was going on in the first place. And after falling off walls to my deaths over and over and over again I started getting soooo annoyed! This game is horrible! Dont buy it!
5,Awsome,this game is so much fun i played it non stop till the end. i also liked how each level of difficulty the whole game changed a little. Very fun.
3,Prince of Persia 3 Review,"Bought this as a gift. Was very suprised to find a new copy of this game.Was a little disappointed that it didn't arrive before Christmas, but overall happy with purchase."
2,WAYYY overpriced,"so, how dose a 22"" webber grill with ash catcher cost $129, but this grill, twice the diameter and twice the material, ends up being 10 TIMES the cost?????????"
5,Prepare to Entertain!,"If you like the 22"" or 26"" Webers you will love the Ranch Kettle. Cooks just like its smaller kin but with the ""Grande Meals"" in mind. Plenty of room on the grill to move things around from direct to indirect heat. Weber says you can put 27 game hens at once on it. Heck with the little birds, to give you an idea of the cooking surface - I filled the grill with 20 chicken halves. A great investment!"
2,Not that great...,"I bought the small size shirt, size 6-8, for my son who just turned six, and is average size. It is WAY too small for him, and it barely fits my three year old, who is also average size. The shirt is also way too long for the width, making for a very odd-looking shirt. If it hadn't been so cheap to begin with, I would send it back."
5,nice design,This is a great camera for its price. It's very easy to use and fits well into the hand.
4,"Of what's available, this is helpful","You don't have a ton of options for Western Armenian. This CD will help your ear to understand pronounciation. The pronounciation is clear and the vocab is useful. There's a book that comes with it, although it's translated from English to written Armenian, so unless you read Armenian it's not helpful. I found ""Western Armenian Dictionary and Phrasebook"" (I'd give this book 5+ stars) to be much more helpful. It's written in English and the Armenian pronounciation is phoenetically spelt in English. I'd buy the phrasebook (written by Nicholas Awde and Vazken-Khatchig Davidian) to actually learn words, etc but the cd helps to hear the pronounciation."
5,The comprehensive guide to NFL QB trivia,"Outstanding book. 11 years later (1988 publishing), it is still an entertaining and informative book that I often refer to during football season. I wish they'd publish an updated version. Many things have happened in 10 years - Elway's rise, Jim Kelly's 4 Superbowls, Brett Farve, Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe, Scott Brunell and Steve Young just to name a few. The book covers many interesting aspects - preponderence of star QBs from certain universities, aging not so gracefully, Steve Deberg's many trades, the QB class of 83, black QBs, ""franchise"" QBs that never materialized, etc. Highly recommend the book to any NFL fan. One of my favorite books on football."
1,Uninspired music,"This CD is a low point in Argentinian rock. The childish lyrics, and the more than common melodies, gives us a pale reflection of argentinian rock when you compare it with Charly Garcia or Fito Paez. For people with a low IQ.Pablo"
5,A stable album.,"Five stars because, perhaps, this one is the most mature and complete album out from all Andres Calamaro's discography, which also flag the end of an era on his career as the following releases would have a lesser media impact and be quite more experimental rather than focused on mainstream. Probably the best one to listen if you're a Calamaro newcomer as it exactly portrays his musical background and sonwriter talent.A stable album, with no surprises or exaggerations, which maintains a balanced tone, just euphoric enough and just sufficiently paused, worsen as the end of the record gets closer.A good example from the so-called ""latin american Bob Dylan""..."
3,Not as Strong as the First (but I am still a fan),"After reading Fesperman's first book in this series, Lie in the Dark, I was excited and with the lubrication of a scotch or two downloaded all of the Vlado Petric novels to my Kindle (it is too darn easy). And though I enjoyed this second entry it was not as compelling or gritty as the first. In fact it was a bit clumsy with the ""digging up the past"" metaphors beginning with a Nazi bunker. And the chase prompted by the plot was more of a travelogue that was not very thrilling for a thriller.Still Vlado is an interesting character and his wife and daughter have added some additional grip. That is why I stay optimistic that the subsequent efforts will improve because Fesperman has now coughed up the foundation to move forward with these characters. He remains at his best writing about the absurdities and contradictions of the former Yugoslavia and also when he slags the UN for its ineffectiveness. I remain loyal but guarded as I move to the next one."
4,loved this book,"A friend recommended this book and I was pleasantly surprised.It kept my attention and kept me fully immersed from the beginning to end.Well written, interesting and well on par with other best selling crime/mystery writers.Am looking forward to his next book."
5,The best ever!,I have used this product for a few years now. I keep coming up with new ways to use it - my new favorite is to mix it with tuna for a sandwich. It's also good as a glaze for grilled chicken.
5,Finally an authentic Reiki book!,"The author's have done excellent research into the history and other aspects of the Reiki system. This book distinguishes between traditional and non-traditional information taught in Reiki classes. The author's have even noted the origins of much of the non-traditional Reiki information taught in the world. This book is very densely packed with information. It takes some time to read through it, but it is well worth the effort for those who really want to know as much information about the Reiki system as possible. Thank you Frans and Bronwen for citing your research! :) (...)"
5,Congratulations Frans and Bronwen,"Congratulations Frans and Bronwen, on THE difinitive book on Reiki. I particularly applaud the unbiased reporting of the facts, past and present, all meticulously researched and the Sources of the information listed.No claims of having all the answers or even any hint of pushing your own barrow. As a Reiki Master I often felt that there must be more and was puzzled by some of the conflicting history and the different methods of practising and attuning that are prevalent. Despite the differing methodology, the book doesn't try to invalidate any other methods. This is certainly a great reference book and I have no hesitation on recommending this book to my students and other Reiki practitioners."
5,The Best Reiki Book you will find,"I picked up my early copy of the Reiki Sourcebook hot off the press in November 2003. Having been trained in the western style of Reiki as well as the more traditional Japanese style Reiki, I found the Reiki Sourcebook to be an excellent source of information about Reiki, its beginnings, its history, the people involved in its development during the early 20th century, as well as some of the techniques. The information on Japanese culture is excellent as is the information on lineage. The glossary is brilliant. The authors have also included a comprehensive list of Reiki associations around the world. This book stands head and shoulders above the many other Reiki books that I have read. It is a must for every Reiki practitioner to have in their library."
5,Reiki source book,This is a must have!!!!! Chock full of soooo much information. Anyone interested in Reiki should have this book if no other.
3,REIKI,I was some what disappointed in the information included. If you want history this is your book. If you want to work with Reiki there are better books
2,RIP OFF,ok i totaly think this is a ripoff. there are only 4 episodes and even though it is cool i spent more than 2 months allowence on this and i worked hard. it could have been put toward other cooler cheaper things. decide 4 urselves
3,Hannah Montana,Not a real good purchase. Nothing to do with Amazon.com though. Just don't like Hannah Montana.
5,Hannah Montana DVD.,I recieved my DVD in time for Christmas. I was very happy with it.. It was in great condition. I am very pleased with the product and Amazon.. I got free shipping because I ordered more things.. so it was very nice..
5,LOVE HANNAH MONTANA,"I can't beleve there's A hannah montana DVD I am so getting it!I love miley cyrus I am one of her biggest fans ,but I am ashley tisdale's 1#fan!these are my fave epesods.oops I meddeld agen,new kid in school,I my party and I can lie if I want to,miley get your gum,its a maqunnes world,mask god love."
3,i like the show but the music is....,"i love hannah montana but her music is 100 percent bragging. ""I got the best of both worlds and you dont haha, i can be anyone and your just a little person...."" it goes on and on, if you dont believe me listen to the soundtrack yourself. another problem is that even when just preforming for a live audience outside the show, miley still is dressed as hannah. its just like saying, ""dont be yourself, wear a wig like me"" besides for that, her show is good."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!,"i tunded in the first day this show was on and i loved it! i watch it every time its on. i am now MILEY CYRUS's BIGGEST fan! ( me and miley are like twins!i also like ashley tisdale,emily opsment is very good at playing lily in this show,) but this show was very cool. a girl living double life! pop star hannah/ regular girl miley! it's one of the best tv shows i have ever watched. 1000 stars!"
4,Hannah Montana DVD,"Kids love it. Best part was the audition feature because you got the rest of the story. It is bubble gum sweet, but my girls love Hannah and her friends and their mom can remember the good old days with Billy Ray Cyrus. It is a great combination for families. Even if every episode has a happy ending."
1,Disney Teen Girl shows are brain dead trash.,"One of the worst shows on the Disney Channel. I doubt that this is her real name, It makes her sounds more like an add for plant food or something. The scripts are awful and the songs are even worse. For those who gave this five star reviews, once again I ask, ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!"""
1,I think i just threw up,"I dont get it! whats the point in this terrible show! This show is about a popstar/californa girl wannabe. Oh, and for the hundredth time.... SHE IS NOT A ROCK STAR! She is anything but a rockstar! This show is supposed to be about the life of a pop star. They are way off. The real kind of life of these kind of pop star wannabes is full of too much make up, driving like a maniac, and Kevin Federline. At first glance you think its some cool teen super star show untill you hear the heavy texas accent. When a so called ""popstar"" Says ""howdy!"" You know its over. Over all this show/DVD is horrible. From the bad acting to the terrible songs I give it a well deserverd 1 STAR."
4,The best Nanny Book on The shelves,Coming from a nanny of two years this is by far the best nanny book written. It is a book that I recommend every nanny and parent to read if you are either thinking of becoming or hiring a nanny. I give it two thumbs up!!!!
2,A PROFESSIONAL NANNY POINTOF VEIW,"I have been a nanny for 36 yrs and find that this book like many other do not address many issues that nannnies face. its more for parents but again if you want to keep a good nanny resect her time and effort for example i love job but things get taken for granted>I choose to bath the kids i care for and wax and mop and changes bed and much much more, because i wanted to help out between cleaner but now its expected and when i do the wash on fridays no one puts it away so i am left feeling used and unhappy so parents if your nanny helps you because she wants to don't leave every thing for her to do sometimes she just does not want to.Respect your nanny treat her well its the little things that bother her even if she does not say so .Most nannies I know go above and beyond for the famies that respect them"
3,The Literacy Coach's Survival Guide,"Just as the title states, it provides essential questions and practical answers for literacy coaches.The book consists of 168 pages of information, references, index, charts, graphs, tables, and learning webs, etc.I used this book as a suppment for my textbook for my graduate studies. It is an excellent resource and research tool."
5,Good book for newbies,"Just as advertised, this book answers the practical questions new (or practicing) literacy coaches may have. Your college will teach you content, but this book will help you consider the practical matters of working with adults."
5,Great book for newbies!,I had to purchase this book for a class and really enjoyed reading it. I am in my last semester of my Master's and look forward to using it as reference.
3,Nice listening music,"I liked this CD. As far as the music goes, it's good for listening to. However, the beat didn't really fit my workout needs."
1,aerobic music that didnt work,"I was disappointed when I found that I couldnt use this CD in my aerobic class. It says it is non-stop, yes, but it doesnt flow from one song to the other with the proper 32 ct beat. I like the music but that doesnt matter when I cant use it for what it was intended for.Very disappointing."
3,Goldsmith's Only Entry In 2001,"""The Last Castle"" was the only entry from Jerry Goldsmith in 2001. 'The Castle' is a noble militaristic theme played on the trumpet by the gifted Malcolm McNab; it sounds a little bit like ""Patton"", but its noble feeling makes it catchy. The theme is fully developed on 'September 11, 2001', a elegiac cue which Goldsmith dedicated to those tragic events that occured on that infamous date. The action tracks are interesting, but somehow they don't quite reach the level of those from something like ""Total Recall"". However, the elegiac music is worth the price of this CDThe two songs are the only real lowdown of this CD, especially John Hammond's 'Get Behind The Mule'. So repetitive and boring. Personally I think this album would have worked better without the songs."
5,Perfect For Anybody,"This is the first PDA that I've bought, but when this gets old I'll definately buy another Dell if they continue to make them. The pre-installed Pocket PC 2002 is perfect for writing Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, or just viewing them. There are 3 different methods to input letters including a handwriting transcriber that you can personalize to fit the way you write. It took me about 2 minutes to set up my computer so that I could share files between the two of them. You can view all types of pictures on your Axim with the awesome colored screen. The operating system's name says it all, this is definately a Pocket PC because of all of the things you can do with it."
5,"Fun, useful, and easy","I got one about 3 weeks ago. It's helped me keep my work schedule, my date schedule, and my to-do list down great. I get the news downloaded every day, along with the weather and a few other web sites too. I've been able to store all the needed files and edit them on the go. I can even look at pictures, watch movies, and listen to music directly from the device. The speaker is outstanding. In no time at all, i've been able to write efficiently directly on the screen as it all gets changed into text.This was definately a good buy, especially for the money."
1,biggest piece of junk,"My Dell Axim is the stupidest $500 I ever spent. It locks up, won't recharge, needs constant tending and the battery life is like that of an insect. If you need this kind of useless equipment, buy another brand. Sure, they ship quickly, but using the Microsoft platform just adds to the problems."
1,Save your money for something else...,"Dell does not make a reliable PDA. I am on my third one and it is now a paperweight. Dell does not support their PDA's so if you do buy one, spend the money for the extended service. In my case, the repair cost was stated at $199 and they would send a factory reconditioned unit. You can buy there bottom end PDA, brand new for $199."
1,globe stand,THIS STAND WAS A VERY UNATTRACTIVE COLOR. I SPRAYED IT WITH A GREY STONE FINISH AND IT LOOKED BETTER.
2,Make sure it works first,"We live in a very poor cell reception area so the opportunity to improve the signal into the home was very interesting. We ordered the product from Jubees and after 17 days the product was delivered. We questioned the products ability to work on our cell provider but were assured by the literature it would work. It didnt and it has cost us over $150 to find that out. If you are unsure don't buy this item until you have a guarantee that it will work for you. We spent some time dealing with W-Ex directly and they were very helpful and professional. Unfortunately we could not swap out the unit with them as the dealers have a non compete clause with the company. While I gave the product a low rating, that was due to the limited information about its suitability, if it works on your cell band you should be fine. This is not a small ticket Item and shipping is expensive, so unless you are sure its right for you dont buy it! a restocking fee of 15% leaves you with a bad taste..."
2,"Cheaply made, difficult to use","The case does not close easily and is made of thin plastic that does not hold up to use. The loom is small and has short tines that allow the loops to pop off. The hook is too short to fit all the way across the loom. The loops are neon and thin. We replaced all of it, hook, loom, and loops, for less than the price of this set, and have been much happier."
2,Just ok,"This wasn't really shaped like a foot around the toes. Cookies came out with the general shape, but the toes looked deformed in a lot of them (especially after baking). Overall, I wasn't impressed, especially after having to carve the shape more accurately. It's a good cookie cutter idea, but the shape needs work."
4,Just one little problem . . .,"This soup is absolutely delicious. Its only problem is inclusion of a few asparagus segments with inedible strings. Easily avoided during preparation by snapping the bottoms off the stalks or peeling them at the bottom. Spitting out what I can't chew up is uncouth, but the soup's good enough to put up with it."
1,Get the story straight,"How does a soup with artificial flavors get into the Natural and Organic section? It states ""No artificial flavors"" as one of the features and then lists artificial flavors in the ingredients section!"
1,Serious Disappointment -- broken cans -- loss,"I have bought other Baxter soups so I looked forward to this. It was not worth the wait. I suspect I won't finish the pack of 12. I have had two now, they are lacking in flavor and seriously lacking in asparagus.This is an addition to the first review. I don't have an opportunity to give away the remaining ten cans, as I prepared to remove them from the boxing, some in center were broken, leaking, and cans rusting. In view of rust, I assume the breakage occurred very early after packaging. The entire mess was thrown away. I consider myself lucky that I only disliked the first two cans and did not get sick after eating them."
4,Good resource,"This is one of the few books in English to give a glimpse as to how Chinese style architecture (temple design) can produce beneficial effects on the environment and humans. Most books on Feng Shui are from the fad perspective and are more interior embellishments, often poorly done and hardly resembling true Feng Shui. This book is for those who want to begin to understand the energetics of shape and function and how they interact with energy. Suggest you also find out about BioGeometry TM by Dr. Ibrahim Karim of Egypt."
3,"Useful for college student, don't fear refurbished","I bought this inexpensive refurbished printer to use in my dorm room. I really loved the small footprint -- it fit easily on my desk and was perfect for daily, few-page print jobs. Anything hefty, I would have just used the library's laser printers. This was easy to pack in a box to move to another dorm room or send home.This printer has the same issues as many small inkjets: after two years or so, things start to malfunction. My sister has this printer right now and it only prints in pink and blue mostly. The black ink won't work and the troubleshooting doesn't help. (Google the issue of black ink not working and you'll see that lots people have this problem across many kinds of printers.)Bottom line: Don't be afraid of refurbished printers, but make sure you know what to expect from a small inkjet."
5,Amazing,"This book is fascinating and an excellent dictionary. It doesn't have much explanation, but it does have a very useful index. It arrived on time and in great condition. My Maya club is loving it and we are learning to read and write glyphs."
1,The Uninteligible Life,"The above, is of course a play on words of the book written by these two called the Unimaginable Life. This had to be the most boring confusing and useless thing I have ever bought. Kenny and Julia Loggins are absolutely besotted with their own disfunctional view of their love? and marriage. They had to outline a whole new set of life rules to explain every breath that they take. This is a tome to a deeply troubled relationship that is controlled and defined by Julia Loggins, and unfortunately the directionless Kenny Loggins is in for a rough ride, because if you dont follow the ""rules of discovery"" as dictated by the controlling Julia, this relationship is going to be doomed and so will yours if you follow this.IN FACT, THIS COUPLE HAS SEPARATED AND IS DIVORCING, SO THIS HAS ABSOLUTELY NO VALIDITY AT ALL, AND I COULD SEE THIS COMING A MILE AWAY. ANYONE COULD IF YOU LISTENED TO THIS DRIVEL."
3,A decent industrial album with a couple really strong tracks,"Some excellent tracks in an album that is a bit monotonous. Abyss is an excellent track, with real emotion and a good hook.. just don't pay too much attention to the lyrics."
3,The great divide,"I again with the earlier reviewer who pointed out the noticeable difference between the first part of this book and the latter; when Van der Post is recounting his experiences with the Bushmen (or San, if you prefer) and with various other folk who have come to inhabit the Kalahari the book is very interesting and informative. However, in the second half he feels the need to reinterpret the Bushmen's legends or myths through a Jungian perspective, a treatment I found neither compelling nor convincing. While the fragments of the Bushmen's tales are interesting and Van der Post's ruminations are occasionally thought provoking, I didn't particularly enjoy his technique of intercutting between a few sentences of the one and heavy doses of the other. I suppose that for the reader who cares to interpret everything by archetypes and quests it might prove intriguing, but I soon came to find it rather annoying and distracting."
5,Heart of the Hunter,Anyone who has ever wondered about mankinds early past and development should read this book. A truly loving read about early man on the savanahs of Africa as told by a South African.
5,Awesome Product Will never use anything else,This is an excellent product. 100% natural with natural sunscreen.
1,awful,"This is one horrible CD! I am a major fan of the AEC, Ornette and Air. There are great musicians here who were once a cohesive outfit, These musicians have now created an awful release . Amiri needs to remove himself from the mainstream of existence. His work here is sophmoric.Please save your hard earned money and stay away from this!"
4,Solid Collection of Russian/Soviet Marches,"This disc presents a solid of collection of good Russian marches. The collection spans the Tsarist period into Soviet times. Some of these marches are known under different titles in other parts of Europe. Several are also well known. Agapkin's ""Slav Woman's Farewell"" seems almost like the ""Stars and Stripes"" of Russia! Nearly every Russian march CD seems to have this work on it, as well as the standard ""Preobrazenskii March"" The quality of the playing is first-rate. The band produces a strong and solid sound as only Russian army bands do. The linear notes contain a lot of interesting information in rather chaotic English! Still, this is better than nothing. However, i was surprised at the strong nationalistic tone of some of the writing. This inclined me to think that perhaps this was a work re-issued from recent Soviet times! Its hard to tell. Still, this is a good starter disc for those interested in hearing some good Russo-Soviet martial music."
5,Lots of Fun!,"This disk is a delight for children as well the young at heart. The songs are fun and singable. The acompanying booklet contains the words to every song, so that you can sing along. The booklet also includes motions and/or other activities to go along with a few of the songs. This disk is a great way to introduce young children to the wonderful heritage of American folk music. Adults will enjoy it as well."
2,Minimalistic Webber,"Andrew Lloyd Webber's flop ""Jeeves"" is reborn as ""By Jeeves"". It hasn't been improved, it has just been cheapened. The ""Americanized Premiere Recording"" features a small score played by a small orchestra with a small cast. Definitely, second rate Webber given a second rate production and recording."
5,best game on the market,"i play military games exclusively. this is by far the most intense game ive ever played. whether you're looking for a sweet single player campaign or an even more addictive multiplayer shooter, this is the game you have to get. it has a good blend of strategy and just flat out action to keep you involved and interested without becoming frustrated. the controls are easy to understand, the graphics are the best out to date, the 5.1 makes it that much more intense, and because of the online play, this game will be something you can hang on to and play for a long time. being former military, i can tell you this game is probably as realistic as youre going to get without having to actually go to war. pick it up or even just rent it, try it out but i can guarantee.... you'll be buying this one."
3,Too many glitches for a next-gen game,"Although I feel the graphics are good and the game-play is solid I noticed a lot of technical glitches in the game. I noticed characters being able to walk through each other, your character being stuck in a kneeling position when he should be walking upright, and a humorous side effect of when your character is lying down and by moving the left stick his body would rise up as if the scruff of the neck was carrying him through the air. Put the stick back in center position and he lies down again. I also noticed it caused my XBOX 360 to lock up a couple of times. Maybe I got a bum disc but I feel the glitches and the locking up are related to the software. Jut a warning. I recently got GRAW 2 but have not played it yet so I will see what happens."
5,Amazing,"Visually stunning, and the most fun I've had in a video game since Halo. Easily the best 360 game."
3,Simplify,"Without a high definition TV and a big screen this game is not particularly enjoyable, the HUD is annoying. Needlessly complicated. Harder to maneuver your men then in real life. I haven't really enjoyed Ghost Recon since the 1st one. This will be my final purchase of the GR franchise."
3,For War Buffs Only,"Theres too many button combinations and commands to make this game move from the realm of ""cool"" to being ""fun."" If you are a current or ex-soldier then you'll probably love it as its a pretty realistic simulation of squad based combat. If you're looking for a game to just turn on and blow stuff up mindlessly, this wont be your cup of tea. Dont get me wrong, its good, but it seems geared more toward hardcore gamers than casuals (which I am). Besides, not being able to jump and melee really bugs me. So it depends what you like. The graphics are cool, but the gameplay's fun will depend where your tastes lie."
4,good game,"pros-Graphics are pretty good-large section of weapons-squad control-the act of taking cover-multilayer-Slideing!,there isnt alot of games where you can slide but this one does it well but make sure you have alot of space to slide becasue you can slide far.-3rd person view,im a big fan of 3rd person-HUD has news reports sometimes and you can see what your teammates seeamazingcons--control take a while to get use to-in training you cant identify the text-Squad AI,they run out over corners and sometimes move without me telling them to move- take cover feature,you wall cover automatically, good idea but you can go against a wall and then pop off the wall again or if you wanted to look over a corner you might go past the corner trying to wall cover and then your found out.overall this game is a great game to havei recommend getting it"
3,good game but a little glitchy,"I liked Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, and since this game was reasonably priced I bought it to understand the references to it in the second game. A fun shooter but there are a few glitches. At times you protect VIPs and they do some strange stuff, like push you from behind cover and exit cover themselves to get killed and fail your mission. For the price, it is worth adding to your collection, just be prepared to put up with the glitches."
5,Great gameplay,"GRAW 1 is one of the best games for Xbox. The gameplay is incredible, each map gives you a new way to play and strategize, and the weapons are cool.What makes this game even better is playing multiplayer on Xbox LIVE. Running team eliminations, capture the flags, or defending territories are a blast with a team. You can even dream up your own game like ""president"". That's where one player is the president and you have anywhere from 2 to 3 bodyguards (depending on how many are in the room) plus a mole on the other team. You then hide and defend your president from the attacking team. All the while your mole is going around the map killing the attacking team. It's a blast.Game is A++. And if you like this game then check out GRAW 2."
4,Far Superior To Previous Installments...But...,"Still not as good as the Rainbow Six Series. GR still stands far ahead of most of the rest of the pack. This is a great game at a great price. The main story lacks, but is made up for in the numerous ways the game can be played either solo or with friends."
4,Spc. Massey tells me what he thinks.,"First off, we never finish a game. But when it comes to this one, we got stuck on a rooftop somewhere near the end and it really bothered both he and I.The game lacks a realistic feel, due to the lack of blood.The actual game itself was O.K.The multiplayer, we couldn't figure that out either. Were in Iraq and have a system link. We both felt the multiplayer would make us feel better about getting stuck in the game, but we couldn't!"
5,Must Have for all 360 owners,"This is a must have game for any owner of the XBox 360!! Excellent gameplay, and beautiful graphics."
4,Great game for the Xbox 360!,"I bought this game the day it came out, because I was bored with my current Xbox 360 library. This game is pretty fun. The graphics are truely next-gen. The only complaint that I have with this game is that you can't individualy control your team mates. You can only control them as a group. Other than that, if you like real-life shooters, pick this game up."
5,Truly a great game and I highly recommend it.,"If you are a fan of the Ghost Recon series then you will really like this game. I can't wait to play the 2nd version ""Advanced War fighter 2"""
4,FUN,"A great start for the 360. fun gameplay, decent graphics, good control over your squad. Just try it already."
1,B rate game killed by Bugs,"I have played this game to my end point something like 12 times. This took like 6 hours. How did it take 30 minutes to beat it? Simple. Every time that I called in an Apache to take out a tank, it would come in low, sweep around the tank, and then leave without firing a shot, never to return. The tank that it should have killed then murdered the president of mexico, ending the game. w00t. 1337, dude. $2 per minute of first time through gameplay is the worst deal on a video game that I have ever gotten, hands down. If I had paid $30 for Doom95 Freeware, that would have been a better deal. Also, leading up to this point, I fell through several obscure patches of dirt into hewhaY (also known as avoheJ, hallA, or doG), the creatorless zone; hence the name. I don't know how many bugs there would or would not have been in the rest of the game, but it seems that there were at least a few.It doesn't matter how good a game you can't play is."
2,Not Next-Gen,"I Bought this game with the intention of seeing amazing graphics and spectatular next gen action, and well, that isnt what i got. I play on A Panasonic HDTV and this game does not match up to Next Gen HD graphics, its just like Ghost recon 2, This game is not worth the buy"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"this game has good graphics, ill give it that, but your way better off playing halo 2,(and halo 3 is comming out soon), the graphics are worse, but its a way better story plot, and the controlls are normal, plus the live is much better!!U were warned!!"
2,"OK if you're looking for a ""dance mix""","Quite frankly disappointed. I bought this because I wanted to replace other Djavan CD's that I'd ""loaned"" to friends over the years. These are no longer available; this compilation contains many of the same titles but they are not the original recordings. They have obviously be re-mixed or re-recorded for use in clubs."
5,"Reliable, powerful and wonderful sounding","I already own the Fostex MR8 MKII and love it. I decided that I needed more tracks and bought this unit. This unit performs beautifully. You must use high quality mics to get the full potential of this machine. I use a Mackie 14 channel mixer, a DBX 286A expander and a number of high quality condenser mics. The sound is awesome!!!"
5,Presby Director,Rilling is the definitive interpreter of Bach using modern instruments (as opposed to period instruments). This is a fine recording in every way and assisted greatly in our recent Christmas performance for interpretive ideas.
5,I saw them Live,"Wow on the reviews. They are much deserved.I saw the Wipers live a number of times. Remember they formed in about 1977. So I wouldnt call them post punk, but maybe the first westcoast punk band.The Nirvana connection is warrented, since Kurt Cobain was a big fan of the Wipers and saw many live shows.I agree with the others, the Wipers arent a punk band. What is punk anyways. Im 44 and heard the Ramones in 1974, were they punk, no, they were pure Rock N Roll.Greg Sage has a style that defines original.Greg if you read this, I saw you a bunch of times at the Satyricon. Also some industrial part of Portland when the microphone hit you in the teeth. You missed about a half of sec, then kept singing.Greg and the Wipers, thx for the memories.Zenorecords.com go to buy Greg and Wipers itmes.BTW, Roky Erickson rocks. Check his music out also."
5,not from Seatle,"The wipers are not from Seattle.Been seeing the wipers since the early 80's in PORTLAND, own the three CD's on this set on record, bought it for the extra stuff. Best band ever. My friend spray painted ""doomtown"" on the highschool stadium in honor of the same song."
2,Single Players Beware!,"GAMEPLAY: Presumably okay for multi-player addicts.GRAPHICS: Average, flat grounds and environments; nothing to write home about.SOUND: Again, average -- nothing that we haven't heard before.I bought this game because the trailers looked fantastic, and the self-proclaimed best single-player ever.DON'T BE FOOLED!This is a multi-player game only! I had to spend sixty-dollars to learn this! If you like multi-players, then this is your average run-of-the-mill multi-player. However, if you are like me and, really only enjoy playing single-player, consider yourself warned, the single-player campaign consists of mulit-player maps with AI competing against you. No bosses, no breath-taking missions, just capture the flag against AI.I've never been so disappointed...Oh wait, then there's Alone in the Dark..."
4,Good game,Personally i think its amazing at first.. but it gets boring if you dont have anyone to play with.. the multiplayer though is great.. coop is very fun and exciting when youre splitscreening.
2,Its a good game but no more online,"I loved the speed of the shipping and the disc wasnt even scratched, but when i tried playing, the servers were down. Apparently they shut down the servers for the game and i am more of a multiplayer gamer, i dont do single player, so finding this out was quite a bummer for me. Now the only way i can play it with others if i use xbox system link, or play on the same console."
5,This game is a blast!,"This game in my opinion is one of the best shooters out there. I really like the taunts that your character can say to keep the action going. I also love the team deathmatch which you can play with other players on your team to try and defeat the other team online. Go out and buy this game, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Great game, classic Unreal Tournament action","This is a great game upholding the Unreal Tournament franchise in fun and intense action. I give it 5 stars for the fun-factor but have to give it an overall 3 stars for the lack of a party system and requirement to hold down a button to voice-chat (yes, I know about the unplug hack)."
4,"Fun Game, Better than expected!!","A 4-5 stars rating is what games deserves. This game is more fun than the PC versions. The Graphics & Gameplay is what stand out in this game. Vechicle CTF is a lot of fun and creative. The gameplay is lightning fast. If you like fast-pace FPS, you will be pleased with this game. Epic changed the graphics to look more like GoW. The Sound is little lacking.So far, this is my favorite Xbox 360 game."
1,Received item on time but not in good condition.,"I bought this item on February 20,2006. I repotted it in some good potting soil about a week after I potted it the leaves and buds starting coming off now they are all off. I contacted the seller and received a very negative response. Told me they were not married to my plant. In other words they were not responsible for the quality of the plant. I was shocked."
2,"Sure, it holds stuff...","But, it took me an hour or so to remove the stickers. Why can't they put them on the back for god's sake? I'm not sure what kind of glue they use on those, but it took a scraper to get it off. Doing so quickly revealed that the color is not consistent all the way through the product. The scratches from taking stickers off turned white. Also, there isn't adequate space in the slots to get a decent size screw in. There are better products out there (i.e. Gladiator) and I'd stay away from the cheaper stuff like this.Update: Everything is assembled and the baskets are attached, but it doesn't take much weight to pull them out of the slats. I'm returning this for a solid wood system."
5,"Suncast SW04 Slatwall 12x48 Inch Section, Light Taupe","I installed one piece outside close to my pool equipment. I can hang brushes and small cleaning equipment on the slat-wall rather than inside a storage box so it dries easier. You have to drill through the resin (plastic?) material to mount. However, it's easy to drill through but no hardware is included. The instructions are on the 8.5"" x 11"" label attached to the piece. I hope you have better luck than I did removing the label. Overall, worth the price and well made."
3,O.K. game,The first thing that you will notice is that the graphics and sound are amazing. The next thing you will notice is the game play is slow at least to my preferences. Now the game is better than the movie the movie looked great it just was too corny. Man was it corny I fell asleep. The game provided some mild entertainment but not enough for the hard core gamer. I suggest renting or a purchase for a child under 16.
3,Easy achievements,"Most of you who are looking to play this game are looking for the super easy 1000 Xbox live gamer points.. That's what brought me to this game too, however I was not expecting a mildly entertaining game. I was pleased to find this game was okay to play... Decent graphics, amazing sound, great voice acting. It's a nice little time filler. Give it a try!"
3,Rental at best,"This game was very fun, that is, while it lasted. The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is solid. You get to play the game as Jack and (just a little) bit as King Kong. You get to use a variety of weapons (sniper rifle, pistols, bones, spears, etc) which was pretty cool. In the end though, this game is way too short and(...)is just too much for this game."
1,"This game made me sick, literally!!!",I could not play this game for even 5 minutes. The graphics gave me motion sickness and I had to lay down for 30 minutes. This has never happened to me before with any other game.
3,Good graphics? I think not.,"I judge a game's graphics beginning with how well the character's mouth moves to the dialog/words. That tells me if the designer really cared. The characters in King Kong have mouths that just open and close like they are saying ""ma ma ma ma"" over and over while the dialog is happening. It actually looks ridiculous. Not only that but even in the first scene in the boat, if you look to the side you will see the oars never even touch the water, create a ripple, NOTHING. One even goes right through a huge rock.This is the first game I put in to show off my 360 to other people and they laughed at how pathetic it looked, after I had hyped what I had heard about this game's ""great"" graphics.And the first action scene? Shooting at crabs with a pistol? What am I, 6 years old?Big thumbs down."
3,not 2 great,"This game let me down prety bad , i didnt expect it to be nearly as good as call o duty 2 which is an amazing game and lived up to all the hype, but this game did look realy good and the grahpics looked amazing and they are , and thats about wher it ends nothing else impressed me with simple shooting and puzzles so simple any 4 year old could figure them out. I jus didnt have any fun with this game besides the grahpics looking amazing there isnt anything else to see , you just fight the same dum ass looking enemies including big spiders ,crabs and scorpions that all look quarny as hell . And thats about it you dont even get 2 use kong much its prety much all fps and shooting the same old enemies and only bein able 2 hold one gun at a time with little amo. Yep this game jus isnt fun its prety lame and DEFINATLY not worth 60$. My opinion rent it or wait til its cheaper."
4,King Kong is strangely fun,"This game is awesome the graphics suck though but there are realistic effects to like when you approach a dinosaur your character shivers. WHen you tap the ""B"" button your character tells you how much ammo you have but if you run out of breath he wont. There is also a system called ""The food chain"" you take a stick or a bone catch a fish or a bug or a fly on it toss it and the other creatures of the island will run towards it to eat it this is a fantastic time to have spears ready as to ambush them. Over all I bought this game for ten bucks and it is well worth thirty bucks and is allot of fun I recommend a purchase"
3,"Good game,","Great game for the price!!!!!But as you must know, It's old, so don't expect the best images.The sound is perfect!"
3,Great game really fun...way too many flaws!,"This has got too be one of the funnest games made for 360. In my opinion, it would be in the top 10, but there are so many flaws. For example, you have to turn your 360 off and then back on every once in a while, because the AI wont interact with you properly. It gets sooooo annoying! But anyway, I would reccomend it! Maybe they will come out with a patch soon..."
2,Great at first,I have had this fryer for just over a year & it suddenly quit working.it worked fine when it was working but they need to use a better gauge wire to the heating element & maybe it won't short iteslf out.
1,"Works great for 18 months, but then fails","Our Euro Pro Fryer has a lot of nice features and worked great for 18 months in which we used it 10-12 times. However, its operation then became erratic, where it would not quite reach temperature and then became useless when reaching only 190F when set to the max. We kept it clean and took good care of it, but to no avail. I called customer service and reported that many of us are seeing this problem, but they could do no more than offer to repair it at a cost of $20-$30 plus $9 shipping, since it was past the year warranty. That is a lot of effort and money and I have had poor experiences with repair jobs where there can be a lot of back and forth before you get a working unit. I am going to look into a more professional unit at a kitchen supply store this time. I would not recommend purchasing this one unless you only plan to use it occasionaly and are OK with throwing it away and getting a new one periodically."
5,Best Haggadah on the market!,"Without a doubt the most wonderful and gorgeous modern Haggadah of them all! Transforms the seder experience. Becomes a focal point in and of itself. Refreshingly different! The suggestions for discussion are often quite interesting, but this Haggadah is all about the photography,"
1,micrometer caliper,"recentley i purchase this caliper, i was so excited to get it, now i had gotten it i am disappointed as it is not accurate, efforts to tune it prove futile.I wasted my money"
5,Ultimate tortured hero,"First, what didn't I like? That this was part of a trilogy, and I didn't know it! I have the first one, I realized, and don't know where it is. Story of my life. What else didn't I like? Can't think of one damn thing. This is one of the BEST books I have ever read! Absolutely freaking phenomenal. The hero and heroine are two of the bravest people you'll ever read about - they've been through the fires of hell (Nicholas literally), yet they struggle through and manage to find love. This is the first book I've ever read with a pregnant heroine who is about to give birth. Nicholas is the ultimate tortured hero. The building of their relationship together is beautiful to behold. Yes, I'm gushing. I just can't describe how much I love this story."
3,Strange cover for a book about the French and Indian War era,"First, this was an entertaining, quick read. Good, not great. I had ordered the book from an online description. I was astounded that it has a gym-sculpted man's chest on the cover...looked very contemporary and had NO RELATION TO THE STORY AT ALL.A book about the French and Indian War/Benjamin Franklin era with a gym-sculped man's chest on the cover?I am really curious as to why a publisher, or whoever does it, would choose such inappropriate cover art-- in my opinion, a real disservice to the author and the reader."
3,"Nice romance, but a bit too detailed in the horror area","I like romance in my romances, and the description of tortures in this novel was overly graphic. It's entirely possible to get this across without the gore. Does not belong in romance in this reader's opinion. As a Native American, I don't like repeated references to my people as ""savages"", either....especially when equally harsh treatment was given to Indians by white people.That said, the couple is quite likable and the writer's knowledge of colonial America is evident. Worth a read despite the gore."
5,Fantastic!,"This is right up there with Pamels Clare's Surrender and Untamed.Fantastic read from all aspects - hero and heroine, storyline, history, the way it is fantastically written by Pamela Clare.I especially loved the way Alec and Jamie from the first two books of the trilogy, play a part in the last chapters of the book.I absolutely loved it!"
4,Two wounded souls that will grab your heart from the start!,"I really liked Ride the fire. Granted, the tortue scene was graphic, but to me that made it all the more gut wrenching. It made me FEEL. Whether it's a good feeling or a bad one, empathy is a driving force in all fiction be it romance or otherwise.I liked the way Pamela Clare drew out the mystery surounding the hero and heroine's past, giving away just enough to make want to know more.Bethie was a lovely character with a lot of heart and I liked her imediately. Nicolas was fantastic! Anyone would be hard pressed to not love him. His chatacter was so earthly and believable - given the circumstances.Overall, a fantastic read, with chatacters that will grab your heart and not let go!"
2,Low Quality Water Gun,"I bought two for my 7 & 4 years sons. One was broken when we received it, the other one only worked for a day. Very dissapointed with the quality of the toy. And it doesn't really shoot far. What a waste of money!"
2,this gun is a rippoff,"i got this gun and played with it for a long time! until it started to break after about an hour of play. it does not shoot far, it wastes batteries, it breaks after the first time of use. this gun should not be bought. =("
2,OLY FOR KIDS GET A BETER GUN IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE GFUN LIKE THE BUZZBEE,DOESN'T SHOT FAR AND ITS NOT REALY FUN ALSO IT NOTHING COMPARED TO anything from buzz bee toys
3,"Death, resurrection and transmigration.","Ah, could it be? Could the shame and the horror of a truly great band going [...] up and turning out two humiliating albums of pure suckage come to an end? Will this be an Ali-style rope-a-dope? Or will these guys be the next Gary Numans, with an entire generation of apologists trying to convince the rest of us that they were cool once?These are probably high stakes. Happy Tom has been talking for years now about growing up from punk into glam. Not even David Bowie could do both glam and punk on their own terms. If these clowns manage to hit *that* ball out of the park, they're gonna write the blueprint for pretty much the whole rock scene for a long time to come.So far, the prerelease tracks on YouTube and elsewhere are promising... Boys From Nowhere, We're Gonna Drop the Atom Bomb and Welcome to the Garbage Dump are pretty great.But it remains to be seen if these are truly the ubermenschen we've all heard about."
