1,Who let this one out of the trashbin?,"Vanity project about two hookers who survive a car accident, steal the boss' diamonds, and make a break for freedom. Amateurish, lame and boring. Complete waste of time from start to finish."

4,Great DVD for New Vegetarians,"Pros: The recipes are simple and easy. Jeff Novick shows how to make lunch or dinner meals, plus a few other breakfast and dessert items. Sometimes the camera moves to an odd angle, but the overall presentation is very good. Jeff explains how he came up with these recipes and presents his extensive background in nutrition and cooking. Having young children help in the kitchen shows how easy these recipes really are.Cons: Most of the meals are too similar, although our family enjoyed eating all of them. Using a different base for some of the recipes might help with providing more variety. Jeff's assistants sometimes make rather innocent, although distracting comments."
5,Awesome fast & healthy recipes that even the cooking-impaired can make!,"I own 2 copies of both Fast Food 1 & Fast Food 2 because they are always out on loan. I've lost over 80 lbs. (from a size 3x or 24W to a size 6 or Small!) after attending the 10-day live-in McDougall program where I first saw Jeff's demo of these recipes live. I bought copy #1 right after the program and copy #2 after so many people asked to borrow it. I don't like to cook and I am not good at it....but, even I am able to make these recipes (which means ANYONE can do it) and I give these McDougall diet-friendly recipes a great deal of credit in making my weight loss and road back to health successful. Everyone who has seen my amazing transformation asks about what I eat and I point them towards this video. Every family can use a way to make fast healthy meals....well, here is the answer to your prayers!"
2,8 recipes for $23.00?,"I wondered why this wasn't offered as a cookbook instead of a DVD. Since I don't have a lot of time to make dinner, I also don't have time to watch a 2 hour DVD. Now I know why it's not a cookbook. There are 5 main meal recipes, a few smoothie and side dish recipes plus the principle that if you use his 5 basic ingredients, you can make a wide variety of dishes. I'm not a cook. I don't make up my own recipes nor do I want to. This video was a waste of money; I am not at all pleased."
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of learning how to put together delicious nutritious meals, fast. What I got was what looks like a (poorly made) home video of basically one recipe repeated 5 times. Throwing a few canned and frozen ingredients in a pot and just heating it up is not cooking. Nor does it give the dish any flavor. The recipes all taste awful. If you eat crap food to begin with and don't have any taste buds, then you might like this DVD but otherwise, all the recipes taste like warmed up V8 juice. Maybe if a little bit of olive oil (which won't kill anybody) was added (along with salt, which Jeff says can be added) and if the food was actually allowed to cook properly, maybe half an hour, to allow all the flavors to blend together, then maybe these recipes might be edible. Otherwise, save your money. And what's with the two girls (his neices I'm assuming) ooohing and awwwing every 5 minutes? Very annoying!"
2,DOES NOT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS CREATED BY BOOK TITLE,"In general this book was a disappointment.I am not exactly a beginner but I found myself spending more time trying to figure out the system or format that the author was using than I was spending actually playing the guitar.There are a couple of pages with some interesting information on them but not enough interesting information to make the purchase of this book worthwhile.If you are looking for a guitar book that helps to make it all make sense, this is definitely not the book.Unfortunately, I purchased several of these ""Roadmap"" books at the same time. I think that they all suffer from the same deficiencies."
2,Half Assed,"This books was way too overhyped. Upon purchasing it I was greatly dissappointed. It does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory, but a lot of its information is half assed. The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong. A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid. Who cares how to play ""Louie Louie"" in a bunch of different ways, but I suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard. Nevertheless, this book is boring and incomplete. Buy something else."
3,"There are better options - this one is ok, but not great","This is a ""good"" summary text, but I do not recommend this book because I felt that the author did not explain terms prior to thier use, which for beginners, is very confusing. I was familiar with the terms so it was ok for me. It covers the major topics but not that well, in my opinion.I'd recommend instead the following package for beginner/intermediate guitarists: Alfred's essentials of Music Theory Complete Student CD-ROM, Barrett Tagliarino's Fretboard workbook whch is excellent, and if you are looking for a full guitar curriculum, the DVD course ""Learn and Master Guitar"". You can get everything you need without purchasing this book. It's not bad, but its not complete and you'll end up buying other redundant materials to understand it."
5,Juggernaut of information,"This book should be the standard in guitar education. It tells you everything you want to know and then some more, and will take anyone learning guitar, regardless of genre of interest, where they want to be. Fred Sokolow is an amazing guitar teacher, and I own many of his books, and would advise them to anyone, after all, the methods are tried and proven, and by far the MOST potent efficient teaching technique. You can't go wrong with""Fretboard Roadmaps"". Thanks for giving us the information, Fred."
5,This book made music make sense!,"I have been banging my guitars around for years, and I play pretty well, but I'm like a monkey - monkey see, monkey do. I know basic chords, and I've tortuously put some lead stuff together with some tab help. But now that I've started this book, I am understanding what I'm doing; I understand how the notes work together, where to find them, and how they make up chords. Instead of just ""put one finger here, and two more over there"" you will understand the relationship between the major notes and it's 3rds and 5ths, etc. I'm not even halfway through the book, and I have gotten much, much more than my money's worth from this. These ""roadmaps"" are getting me past the ""roadblocks"" that have kept me from really advancing in my level of play. I'm so fired up from the doors this book has opened, I can't believe I put my guitar down long enough to type all of this."
3,Only so-so,"I can't recommend Pacific Beat. Granted, Parker has a good prose style, and developed the characters well. Unfortunately, the story dragged and the ending was a disappointment. I agree with the reviewer who thought this was too dark and too slow."
4,"A good read, not a great read. I'd give it a 'B' or a 'B+'","So, why not an A?For my tastes, it was a little too dark and a little too slow. Sometimes it felt like some of the plot twists were forced on the reader by way of surprise information (to the reader) that all of the characters already knew about, such as the many connections between the land developer and the local politicians.On the other hand, I was surprised by the ending which, despite the slow parts in the rest of the book, just flew by.Strong character development, good use of false leads. Solid, solid work."
3,Too long!,"Jefferson Parker has talent, he writes in the Ross MacDonald manner which is great but he really needs to shorten the books a bit. This one went for 450 pages and I think 300 pages would have been more than enough.The lead character has just returned from Mexico after a hellish trip there (not too sure why there was a need to push being falsely accused and thrown into jail then mysteriously released, if you aren't going to explain what happened with the release) and is catching up with his family. That night his sister is found murdered.The novel is based on the mystery of what happened to the sister and in the best private eye tradition, there are deep dark secrets going back many years that come to light during the course of the book.It is not a bad book just dragged so much."
1,Stay In Your Lane,"This jogger/stroller has a mind of its own. Just like that crazy shopping cart that steers left. This stroller has that same tendency.We wanted a big wheeled stroller for our forthcoming colorado vacation.The first stroller would tend to gently veer left. Well thats ok for a block or so, but a mile into our test walk it got pretty irritating. My left arm was getting tired trying to keep in lane. So we exchanged it for anouther one. . . . . . Well sure enough it kept gently pulling left also.At the store you really can't appreciate the pull because you walk a few feet down the lane. So we went back again. Plopped junior in and strolled the store. Yep. That one pulled too.Its a sturdy stroller. Easy open - easy close. Nice consol for keys and stuff. Under the stroller storage bin. Not too heavy given its sturdiness. . . . . . But that veering is unbearable."
3,Good functional stroller.....,"I am not what you would call a ""hard core"" runner, so for me this works pretty well. I average about 35-40 miles a week and my daughter is 18 months old and it still puts along just fine. It is not very functional for use outside of the athletic world, but all in all it is a great product!"
2,baby trend stroller,they sent me a different model and I had to return it (I wanted the front wheels with the option to swivel). Got mad at the time but had everything solved and was reimbursed afterwards. I ended up buying another model in a local store.
3,good for the price,not as heavy as what is needed for stability but may be able to mount it on a block of wood-good for the price
4,Real Country Lives,"I am not really a big Country fan especially the slick-overproduced rubbish coming out of Nashville for the last 20 years.A friend dragged me to a see Emmylou Harrris backed by Spyboy with Buddy on guitar and the best Bass/Drum duo I've ever seen live.I was absolutely blown away by the band, sure Emmy was great but the90 min warm up set had the whole place up rockin, they blew the roof off the place, Buddy is the most versatile guitar player I've ever seen, hecan wail with the best but is also very tasteful and never stepped on Emmy's singing while she did her Red Dirt Girl/Wrecking Ball stuff. He played the original Daniel Lanios guitar parts MUCH cleaner & better than the studio version. He can also sing like an angel.A new fan and a convert."
4,Not bad at all.,"I'm not joking. Budddy's my mother's brother, so I love all his stuff. This CD was made by Hightone Records when he and Julie were leaving them. My favorite song on it is probably either ""Take me back"", or ""Out in the rain"". It is a repetition of songs from their other albums, mostly their duet album, called ""Buddy & Julie Miller""."
5,Excellent Point-And-Shoot Camcorder,"Prior to buying this particular Camcorder I have owned over the past 6 years 2 digital Mini DV Camcorders from Sony, but felt the media is now outdated for the multimedia environment of today, so I opted for the Sony DCR-DVD403, in the belief that Sony's DVD Camcorder design is now on a par with Mini DV Camcorders. I must also add that I was looking for a small point-and-shoot camcorder, and not a Pro-Cam.I was initially pleasantly surprised by the small size of the Camcorder and its simple interface. I was also impressed by both video picture (3.3 mega pixel CCD) and sound quality. The DVD is a real plus for me as I use DVD+RW, and these are both re-recordable and recognizable by my laptop (Sony Vaio), so I have no compatibility complaints. Overall, I rate the Sony DCR-DVD403 very highly for those who want a quality point-and-shoot camcorder that is easy to carry around."
3,Auto Lens Cover broken..same issue,This happend with in year. I seriously think sony should recall this product . it has major issue with this lens cover. if it happens u need to pay 150 $ for fixing. for labor. I sent a big email to sony . I don;t think they will do any thing about it.
2,"Great Camera, Now USELESS! (auto lens broken)","We babied this camera for less than a year--low mileage, carrying case, etc. Great quality, not a cheap unit... Now the auto lens is broken and won't open. No photos, No video. From the reviews it seems like this is all too common. You'd think Sony would put some thought into how they could make one of the only moving parts last longer than a few months! Buyer beware...(or take the replacement policy!)"
2,Lens Shutter stopped working,"I had bought this Camcorder 4 months ago and now that I am about to leave for vacation the lens cover (shutter) does not open. I called Sony and told them about this and they asked me to send this to one of their service center and asked to pay $150 upfront for labor charge.Other drawback is that for outdoor shooting 5.1 audio captures too much wind noise.I am very unhappy with Sony quality in recent products I bought. I ""WAS"" a Sony fan but no more. I have a 2 year old Mini-DV Camecorder in which the Mini-DV does not come out. You pay BIG bucks for very poor quality.Stay away from Sony products...there are other better products for half the price"
3,Mixed feelings,"Sony DVD-handycams take excellent video-shots. However there are a few disadvantages with recording on DVD. Although, I have an earlier model, I assume the problems are the same. The small discs are quite expensive. If you use the regular non-re-writable discs, you can't regret, rewind and retake the last scene. This is particularly annoying if you forget to turn off the power switch before you put the camera in the bag and accidently trigger the 'record' button. The entire disc can be wasted! And you are stuck with Sony's editing software. Other standard editing packages assume DV-input from tape, and nothing else! So, nowadays I always use rewritable discs to allow for more flexible recording. And at home, I use the Sony software to copy selected scenes to less expensive DVDs."
1,Mechanical Problems,"This camera has built-in lens cover opener. After powering the camera, they should open. Soon after purchasing this camera I started to have problems with automatic lens cover opener. Sometimes they didn't close. I ignored it. Now, they just don't open at all. In a nutshell, after just one year this camera is JUNK!!! I believe that Sony's ""precision"" gear mechanism opening lens cover has faulty design. Secondly, for such basic thing as lens opener, they could have provided some ""push-up"" button to unlock it. Don't buy this camera w/o some ""protection plan"". Sony's warranty is miserly 3 months. Dust accumulation, parts friction or minute dislocation etc could kill this camera after 3 month, then what???"
4,Great Camcorder,"I love this camcorder and I have had no mechanical problems with it whatsoever, the only problem with it and the reason I gave it four stars is because of the wind noise. If you can get over that this is the dream camcorder. Everything is working perfectly even after having for a year and clunking it a few times! LOL. Also I lost the manual to the camcorder so I e-mailed the customer support and they gave me a link to get a new one on the internet. yay for sony!"
2,Auto Lens cover broke,"This camera has a nice picture and sound, and easy to play disks, but after a month and a half the lens cover (shutter) stopped working! The camera won't take videos or even pictures now, not even if we prop open the lens cover, so if I don't get it fixed we can't use it at all. And even with the 1-year parts warranty, Sony still is charging $150 flat rate labor fee to fix it because I didn't report it before the 90th day. And with no guarantee it will stay fixed, I am wondering if this camera is an endless money pit trap. I see several other reviews with the same problem, so please be forwarned."
3,Does not work on Mac,I am very dissappointed with this cause it does not work with apple technology. There is no way to download anything to my computer(Mac) and no one told me. I have talked to the people at Sony and at Apple and they told me that there is nothing I can do...which I am not happy about at all. On the positive side the quality is very good for the recorder although to record on the highest quality on disc you can only record for 20 minutes per disc which can be a pain if you want to record for longer without replacing the disc. I dont know about the quality of photographs cause I obviously can not download to my computer to look at them or print. This is probably a pretty recorder for someone who owns a PC and never plans to get a Mac
2,Mac Owners Beware,"My husband and I were very excited to get this camera because we wanted to edit video on our Mac. We did our research, compared several models, and even called Sony to make sure that this camera was compatible with our Mac and they told us it was. In the last few days, we have really enjoyed using this camera, it has great sound, a crisp picture, and is easy to use. It is virtually worthless to us, however, because it is not Mac compatible. I really do not appreciate being misinformed. Sony, shame on you.I'm sure that I can find some third party software out there that will enable me to convert the video, but right now I am EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED with this product- Sony's website offers virtually no support for those of us outside the PC world. Thanks for nothing, Sony."
1,Lens Cover 17 days over worthless warr..,Poor lens cover design this is an offical money trap dont buy this product311 spending towards a quality cammera!
3,Not always possible to transfer movies to PC Picture Package fauld,"I share the view of many others in this that the product is fairly good. And it produces a good quality video. It is possible to transfer clips to the pc using included Picture Package. But this does not work always. Picture Package does not copy the movie in some cases for XP home edition or in same cases when the user has changed from user accounts and is not the Admin.Wind is a fairly important problem, there is no help on cancellation of this. It will make your voice un-usable in this cases.Practical in the sense that you can make copies of the small DVDs"
4,ATTN: MAC users,It does not matter what OS is running on your Computer. To access the videos and pictures stored on the DVD just pop the DVD in the DVD drive and launch your favorite file manager to get to the files. You can also use your favorite Image/Video editor to do what you want with the recorded content.The only thing that is not compatible with the MAC is probably the included S/W which is pretty useless for for most purporses. I like the whole idea of not having to wire the camera to the PC to access the recorded content (which is the case with MiniDV camcorders).
3,Better off with miniDV,"I just returned my DVD403 and purchased the Canon Optura 600 instead (brand new just came out miniDV with 4.3mpx photos).The 403 is nice, but the miniDVD is too limited, specially if you want to edit a lot of video after shooting it like I do. No 1394 port was disappointing.It's a good camera strictly for simple home movies and not much else. Well built, good features, but mpeg2 is just not as good as miniDV output...Do your research before jumping into this one. Oh, getting -RW media is not all that easy either... A lot of places don't carry it and it's a tad expensive..."
1,Lens Cover BROKE in 4.5 Months - Sony DCR-DVD403,"I thought Sony was a trusting brand but don't be fooled.....Sony doesn't make things like they used to. My camcorder also broke in 4 months. When I called their 800 number to get it serviced, they want $311!!! Are they NUTS!!! I was also told by the woman on the phone that they received lots of calls today about the LEN Cover failures. Someone should start a class action on this CHEAPLY made/OVERPRICED product."
1,Wind noice is the killer.,"When recording outdoor, even there is not much wind at all, this camcorder produces a lot of wind noise just like a thunder storm out there. I set the volume to low in the setup menu, but it does not help at all. The picture quality is good, the wide screen produces a very nice view on the 16X9 TV."
1,Don't waste your money,"The shutter stuck the second time I used the thing. Unfortunately, I didn't try to return until day 91. Sony wants over $200 just to send it back for repairs! Don't spend this kind of money for something with a 90 day warranty!"
3,DANGER! PICTURE PACKAGE!,"The camera works great but ...Neither Sony nor Pixela, the makers of the Picture Package software that comes with some Sony camcorders with mini-disks tells you that the software IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP, SERVICE PACK 2! It will crash your computer or not work properly. DO NOT install the Picture Package software if you have run Windows XP. If you have a DVD player on your computer, you can download the photos from the mini-disk without this dangerous software. Shame on Sony and Pixela for selling the software to Windows XP users or including it with the camera without a warning."
3,Mac Problems,"The Mac comments so far have been both right and wrong. Yes you can pop the DVD into your Mac and access the files, but you can't edit them with any included software on the Mac, and Sony doesn't have anything for us. However there is shareware available that will convert the DVD footage into something iMovie can edit. It is called MPEG Streamclip.It really isn't hard, but it isn't very friendly either. If you are a no hassles Mac owner, you might want to skip these DVD camcorders."
1,Perfectly dreadful,"This is a boring song from the musicalSunset Boulevard, sung by Glenn Close. She sings pretty good, but the song stinks. The ""b-side"" is even worse. It's an instrumental medley from that same show, by Andrew Lloyd Webber. This is the track listing:1. ""The Perfect Year"" by Glenn Close2. ""The Sunset Suite"" by Andrew Lloyd Webber"
4,You'll like it if you like music,"Since I first listened to Caniballi over 5 years ago I've become a fan of Raf's music. In every album he manages to include songs for different moods and it seems to me that Manifesto takes this sort of electicism even further. You'll find some typical radio-ready Italian pop songs, a couple of romantic tracks, some that border on the jazzy side and even an instrumental synth/techno, almost dancefloor oriented, tune. I wouldn't say this is album for just everyone, but rather for the fortunate people who love and appreciate music of several different styles."
4,A Great CD,"Raf's ability to write beautiful songs over and over astounds me. His music seems to get better over the years. This CD has a wonderful dance-pop flavor to it. The first track, ""Sei la Piu' Bella Del Mondo"" is my favorite. The upbeat melody and lyrics take you away to another time and space. The beautiful love song, ""Dentro al Tuoi Occhi"" will send shivers down your spine. The whole CD seems to rebound off catchy dance beats and heart wrenching love songs -- ending off the CD with the VERY JAZZY, ""Interagendo"". I never realized Raf had some heavy jazz in him! A great CD. You don't have to understand the Italian language to enjoy this masterpiece!"
3,Buyer Beware,"I just received my copy today, and, although this is a very fine, high quality, and emotionally moving concert CD, I experienced one major disappointment. The first two tracks listed above under ""On this CD,"" are NOT on the CD! (Come Sweetest Death, Come, Blessed Rest, and Choral Prelude for organ ""Schmücke Dich o Liebe Seele"".) And one of them was the main reason that I bought the CD. Apparently, the pieces were not even part of the concert. The mostly modernist pieces that are on the CD bear a sharp contrast to harmonic, uplifting, beauty, that I had hoped to experience from those missing baroque era pieces, but fortunately a few Bach works are present. I'm not sure why Fox wasted his sublime, masterful talents on some of those disturbing, sometimes excruciating modern works, but I suppose it had something to do with the obligations of the academic environment in which he operated."
2,Flat as a Pancake,"I must give this company high marks for service and shipping. Product arrived on time and well packaged. The ball looked great and I was excited to get and use it, however it would not hold air more that 12-20 hours (sitting on table) No instructions were sent, but I'm sure there is no special trick to airing up a ball, is there?Unfortunately the company was in an out of stock position on this item, I would be willing to take a second chance on it."
3,Shipping Problems,"This company will not ship to Canada! How dumb.The ""World Rugby Shop"" on-line store charges US$20.00 to ship to Canada - a rip off! Their customer service would not explain why the charges were so high. I found another company that will ship a rugby ball to Canada using ""UPS Standard to Canada"" for US$9.04."
1,poor,"I had bought 2 of these within 1 week they both broke, just stapling up insulation. I think this is junk,"
5,Finally a stapler that works,"At first, I was a little wary of buying a different type of stapler. WOW -- this thing is great! It takes a little getting used to but once you do -- it is easier on your hands and just as easilly fires staples flush. Never thought I'd leave my old reliable but this thing has made me change my ways. It also uses all of those T-50 staples I have in my truck! Thank God!"
1,Constant jamming...,"...right out of the out box, it didn't work. If it wasn't jammed, it wasn't shooting staples either. Maybe one in twenty shots actually produced a driven staple, but, more often than not, it simply jammed. Nice ergonomics, but seems to be poorly manufactured. Arrow or Bostich staplers may not have the kinder, gentler ergonomics, but they have been very reliable and are more serviceable."
5,"""Yum Yum Good!""","""WOW!"" This is a terrific cookbook for both beginners and experienced cooks. Who wouldn't find it interesting and a challange to cook a sesame chicken speciality from Jane Fonda;(pg. 168)an eggplant casserole from Debbie Reynolds (pg.82)and a chocolate cake speciality from Diane Von Furstenberg (pg. 285).I am finding the pages at the end of the sections helpful to add my own notes too. And the tips and tidbits throughout the book are always a great addition.Thank you Ms. Rothstein and Ms. Neft - your cookbook ""Recipes for Our Daughters"" has landed a permanent spot in my kitchen!I highly recommend this book to everyone who eats and cooks!Beverly Zucker"
5,Great resource for 'new' chefs,"I just got this from my mom as a pre-graduation gift and it has already been really helpful. The recipes are great - they cover a large variety of cuisines and seem to run the gamut from easy to prepare to more difficult (and thus, impressive!). What I appreciate most are the numerous 'tips & tidbits' and problem solving suggestions. As someone without much experience in the kitchen, these hints will make troubleshooting a lot easier and will probable save more than one potential disaster in my culinary future.This is a great gift that I highly recommend!"
4,An Excellent Reference Tool,"I am a community college English instructor. I have used this handbook in my classes from the 3rd edition to the new 5th edition. I find that it is an extremely useful, well organized, and useful guide for students in all levels of composition courses (pre-college through college sophmore level) and for students writing reports or research papers in other disciplines as well. I highly recommend the text."
5,Excellent complement to Season 1,"Been a long while since i read this or watched Season 1, but it did a good job filling in the blanks and letting you imagine how things would play out. i enjoyed it."
3,Good for anyone who digs 24,"This book is essentially just a recap of everything that happened Season 1. The author just made up the words as a transcript for a Congressional Hearing about the events that occured that day. It's a fun read for anyone who likes 24, and the author has the voice of the characters down, it just seems kind of cheap. There is some good information about what happened in the series between Seasons 1 and 2, and it also provides some more detailed character analysis.I know this author is writing a few more 24 books, so I'd be advised to to review them first before I bought them. If they are the same thing for Seasons 2-4 I'd probably pass on them.Overall though, it is a fun read, and the style (it poses as an investigative reporter who is telling the ""true"" story of that day's events) is cool, it's just not the most thrilling book in the world."
5,Informative,Anyone who enjoys this show will love this book. The book is about Jacks testimony about the events of that day as well as detailed information on all the key players. This book goes into detail the mission he lost all his men in 2 years prior to the California presidential primary. It even tells you what was on Alexis Drazens personal PDA. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of 24.
5,Salad on Ice with Dome Lid,Prodyne AB-3-D Salad On Ice with Dome Lid - Acrylic Salad Bowl and ServersThis is an excellent product and I love the fact that it keeps the salad fresh for a long time.
1,Waste,"Hated it! Ok, the dish is really cute. However, it would not be helpful for an outdoor event. The area that holds the ice is a joke - it would probably hold about 1/2cup of crushed ice. So think about that prior to making your purchase. This dish would not be suitable for an outdoor event. So if you want a cute bowl for indoor entertaining, then this is it!"
5,Awesome,This item works very well especially for a toss salad. Love it This item was a hit at ladies night
5,Great for Popcorn,"I got this bowl from an Amway Ribbon Gift card, and it does serve salad really well, I use it almost daily however for popcorn. It's large enough to catch all the popcorn from my hot-air popper, and excess toppings/oil drain through the grate into the bottom."
3,Think out of the box!,"John Milor's Book Aliens in the Bible examines personal experience, UFOs and new age philosophies through the looking glass of scripture. He supplies verse-by-verse support for his theories while maintaining his views are just a possibility. Importantly, Milor never clouds or diminishes the gospel message of Jesus Christ. Overall his book offers an intriguing perspective and an excellent tool for reaching new agers by introducing those interested in UFOs and new age philosophies to the truth of Jesus Christ. Be warned, some may find its contents shocking."
4,Very possible,"This book's theory that aliens are probably the Biblical beings from the Bible is interesting. Interesting why God might have started the deluge, because the Sons of God mated with human females. Angels or extraterrestrials? You decide."
3,Hire An Editor!,"Hey, Slick: Commendable job tying religion to the whole alien thing--a connection I've always wondered about. But here's a tip: Hire an editor. Virtually every page of your book contains at least one error in punctuation, grammar or spelling, not to mention wrong word usage, mixed metaphors and generally unnecessary rambling. Sure doesn't help your credibility."
1,Just Barely,"As usual, another book that ""proves"" all sorts of things, using the bible. Only problem is, is that one can ""prove"" most anything using the bible or any other book of lore. Remember, the Christian bible is as valid as the story of the tooth fairy or any of the urban myths that are floating around. My advice is to skip this one and use your money, thru Amazon of course, for something a bit more edifying. TaTa"
5,excellent movie,"I like every thing about this movie! It is by far one of the best movies ever made. Great acting, story, action, mystery. Good. Come on, Mel Gibson, Patrick Stewart and Julia Roberts! Conspiracies based on real events and real conspiracies. The R rating makes no sense to me, there is nothing in this movie they couldn't show on public television, I let my kids watch it. Can't beat it for the price. For sure in my top ten of all time."
2,Imitation Milwaukee Sander,"I purchased this sander from Amazon last month and finally used it last week. First off, the sander I received was not made by the Milwaukee company in the USA. I own five other Milwaukee tools, which are fine products that were made in the USA, and this one is not.This sander is not an orbital sander, so I don't know why it was listed as such. I also discovered that it had been manufactured in Taiwan, and with cheaper, weaker materials.The arms holding the sandpaper in place bent completely out of shape on the third piece of sandpaper I inserted. BTW, I'm 69 years old, and not an overly strong person.Instead of the stronger spring steel arms that are supposed to be on the tool, these arms are made of a cheaper, non-flexible steel that bends.I figure that the arms will snap off after about six to eight more sheets of sandpaper are inserted, making the sander useless."
4,Milwaukee Orbital Finish Sander is a great value for the money.,The Milwaukee Orbital Finish Sander has good power and feels well built as it's name should imply. Good value for the money and quick shipping. Right on time! Tom from South Haven
3,very very breakable,I bought this item afew years ago. It snaped off of the base and now i have a plaic base and a metal ship that dosnt look right together.
3,Worth the money,"I got this to fix some metric bolt holes that had stripped out in my Toyota's 22RE timing cover, which is aluminum. The water pump bolts started backing out, and well, they were stripped on the timing cover side...the instructions on the helicoil were simple and easy: Drill, tap with included tool, and then screw in the helicoil part to create the new thread.The only drawbacks I saw in this kit were:1) Not clear how best to address a hole that's deeper than one helicoil unit (I ended up screwing in a second on top, then carefully snipping the excess rising above the hole's top).2) The small tab at the bottom of each helicoil is designed to snap off when the coil is seated, but it's a pain, and I worried about disrupting the new threads when I forced the tab to snap with needle nose pliers.Overall, it's a good kit and I'd use it again."
3,MIXED BAG....BUYER BEWARE.,"This is a review for the 2008 re-issue on Caroline Records.First of all, the good news. The disc has been Remastered. So the music sounds as good as ever. The disc art is somwhat cool despite being somewhat simple. A white disc with the Exodus logo in a hand-written font in red similating blood, with a bit of splatter. Same for the album title on the bottom half of the disc.Now then, for the band news (if you're a collector like me)...the disc comes not in a jewel case with an enhanced liner note booklet, nor in a digipak. It comes in a thin cardboard LP-replica sleeve. And the disc has an inner paper sleeve to protect it from the cardboard. But that's it! No booklet at all...no lyrics, no nothing.Anyway, I give the album 5 stars for the music minus 2 stars for the cheap packaging. I like collectible packaging just as muc as the next guy, but this is throw away stuff."
4,Exodus - 'Force Of Habit' (Capitol),"'Force Of Habit',is in fact the band's sixth lp.I liked this disc at least as much as I did 'Bonded By Blood'.If you're a big Exodus fan,you're sure to dig this record.As for myself,this is only the second of their recorded works that I've had the pleasure.Heard others say that 'Force...' is a bit more melodic than they've been on past releases.Basically,just good old school speed metal.Tunes that I thought stood out were ""Thorn In My Side"",""Feeding Time"",the eleven-minute head smasher ""Architect Of Pain"" and their two unlikely covers,the Stone's ""Bitch"" and Elvis Costello's ""Pump It Up"".Should appeal to fans of Metal Church,Flotsam&Jetsam,Hirax.Overkill and Testament.Sad footnote:not sure as to what the band is doing now,but their vocalist Paul Baloff had passed on awhile back.I'll have to check out some of their other CD's."
2,Didn't even bother going from cassette to cd on this one,"I've been a fan of Exodus since the beginning and I am even a fan of the newer Exodus releases. I had the cassette tape at one point back when it came out and got rid of it eventually. With so many great releases by this band I wouldn't even bother with this one. It sounds like ""thrash lite"" or ""thrash by numbers""...and some of it is just not thrashy. There doesn't seem to be any energy to the songs. Gary's great riffs and crunchy sound are there, but not served in a manner that I care for. Also, when Zetro tries to ""sing"" it gets awkward and unlistenable. I'm amazed that more people aren't ragging on this release (although not too many are praising it either, most people probably just ignore it!)There is a reason that Exodus never plays ANY of these songs in their shows. Think about that."
3,Exodus Force of Habit,"I don't seem to listen to this album very much. Not the thrashy stuff they're known for. A few speedy songs on this, but overall a change of direction by going slower, heavy and chunky. They tried a more melodic route. I liked this line-up they had. I acually like the cover art too, for some reason. Some catchy songs. Iconic thrash band, unique album. This is no lightweight."
2,Only Left Of Center is live...,"This mini-disc has only one live cut, ""Left Of Center"" from a show in Bournmouth, England on 12/17/87. A studio version of the song was originally available on the ""Pretty In Pink"" soundtrack, but I find this version more lively. The other cuts are ""Luka"" from Solitude Standing and ""Neighborhood Girls"" from the her debut album. Only for the Vega zealot."
2,Dated,"While some tried and true prospecting techniques are as old as dirt, this book is dated. It has a lot of general information and can help you understand the jargon, but the info is maybe 40 years old and some things have changed since then. It very broadly covers everything from panning to dredging and camping to staking a claim. As a fairly new prospector I didn't feel as though I learned anything substantial from this book, most everything I had already picked up from other people or my own research thanks mainly to the internet. I wish the book went more into where to find gold, not specifically where but what to look for and reading a river, geology, topography and so on which it only slightly touches on. Definitely a newbie book can be read in one night, might be worth a quick read if it was free but spend your money on something more up to date."
5,Information and history of U.S. guns.,A good resource for pricing and understanding the history of many different firearms.Many drawings help with the descriptions. Anyone with an interest should benefit.
3,Very disappointed,"After the more recent editions of this book in 2nd Edition, I felt disappointed in the lack of information this book contains. There should have been more on the creation of Character and Prestige classes and the treasure tables are very scattered, the collected tables in the 2E books were far superior. However, splitting the treasure into mundane, minor, etc... is a good idea.WotC haven't spoiled the game, though they almost did with the d20 system. Thankfully, the system makes more game universal and interaction between them more possible.The chapters on running games are interesting, but only for new DMs, they are utterly wasted on experienced DMs such as myself, wasting almost half the book.Hopefully, if this is ever reprinted, it will be corrected to make it easier to use for generating treasure, I have never flicked through so many pages whilst handing out magic items before in all my 15 years of gaming."
4,This should have been 1st Edition,"For those people out there who are thinking of playing D&D, this is the book to get you started. For those of you who have been playing for a while, this is the book to keep you playing. WOTC took quite a bit out of 2nd and left a lean version of core rules. So many people had become disillusioned with D&D over the past couple of years with all the different modifiers and convoluted rules, they left for almost anything else. WOTC 3rd edition core rules should excite people into playing D&D again."
3,Dissappointing and Confusing,"WOTC could have provided a book that was clear and easy to follow. Unfortunately, what is presented is full of basic grammar errors, non-original (why do these guys continue to remake the old spells, magic items, and systems?) and poorly organized.I've been playing RPGs, D&D specifically, for about 18 years now. 2nd Edition was able to better organize things, but lacked coherency. 3rd Edition provides better class and ability structure, but failed to provide easy to use manuals and references:*Why are there no colored tabs on the page edge for each section? *Why was there no section of ALL the game tables for easy reference? *Subsections do not stand out well on the ""faux parchment"" background.Someone should be ashamed at this product they created as it could have been much more than it is."
1,Please!,"Junk, enough said!This is really a joke, the worst version of D&D ive ever seen. only good thing is they got rid of THAC0 and added some ability scores that they were missing. But thats it, A waste of money in my opinion. They could have done much, much better."
5,3e Just Gets Better and Better,"This guide is the ultimate must-have for a 3rd Edition DM. It is amazing. It has just about everything you'd like to know about running the game.There is but one drawback I find, although it does not take away from the value of this book. Unlike the Players Handbook, which was readable in a manner that you would a novel, this book is full of tables and such, making it very difficult to see through. You'll probably only read the first six chapters, and use the rest for quick reference during play.Still, it is definitely a five-star buy."
3,"Good, but not Outstanding","As usual, the DM book is neccesary and a ""must-buy"" but it is not as useful as the player's handbook counterpart. I was hoping the DM book would come with a CD-ROM demo of some sort as well, but it did not. The DM Guide is a useful tool for storytellers and Dungeon Master's alike who are either new, rusty, or just looking for ideas for their campaign. Chapter 4 gives you dungeon dressing to drop into your stories for expanded detail and all that jazz. It's a good enough buy for the price and it has some good information, just don't expect to be grabbing for it during the game as much as you will the Player's Handbook."
4,They Keep Getting Better,"I must say, this 3rd edition Dungeon Master's Guide is absolutely fantastic. Just as in the Player's Handbook, the team at WotC has worked to streamline all of the rules and clarify a whole lot of little things. Not to mention, the artwork is awesome. I love the look of the new books -- much cooler than the drab, red-and-black of the old 2E tomes.Anyway, I must recommend this book to everyone who's interested in playing this game. If you're not a DM, you may not actually have to own one, but it's nice to have as a resource, so you can know what's going on...Oh yeah - possibly the most welcomed improvement in these books is the price: $20.00 in stores! That's a bit of a drop, considering the last books were all around $30.00. [The reason it gets 4 stars is because the binding of my book is already starting to break. Hopefully this wont happen to everyone.] So pick yourself up a copy of this book! Good Gaming!"
4,A great complement,"This book really makes things easy when creating adventures.Explains certain topics which could be confusing in the player's book and helps to create more solid worlds, dungeons and places to challenge your players.A simple good book that helps to build your own worlds with a better structure."
5,Underated Rock From Syracuse NY,"Spark Lights the Friction features former One King Down singer Jon Peters. As far as comparisons go that's the only one you're going to get between both bands. A far cry from One King Down, Jon and Jim Heffernan's (Guitar) vocals compliment this perfect melodic mix of hardcore, punk, emo, and indie rock. Despite the majority of the songs being written by Jon (Bass, Vocals), there are still a few tracks written by Jim and Grant (Guitar) to appeal to your other tastes. Not to be out done by his lyrically and musically talented band mates, drummer Emmett lays down an amazing back beat to this record. For fans of hardcore, emocore, and college radio."
4,Wikked cool!,"This album is really great! It's like a mix of punk and hardcore rock. Very different and unique. If you like punk, you'll like this! Grab a copy and jam! =)"
5,"The ""Back Stuff"" is the Best","This is a great book and clearly shows how Christian leadership is different from secular leadership. It is more about ""who"" you are as a leader than what structure you use. But I thought the best part of this book was the ""back stuff."" The audits and surveys in the last part of the book are practical, helpful and hard to find anywhere else. They make this book a must have for those who want to be good Christian leaders.Also look at:The Painful Side of Leadership: Moving Forward Even When It HurtsOrganic Disciplemaking: Mentoring Others Into Spiritual Maturity And LeadershipDeveloping Leadership Teams in the Bivocational ChurchThe Biblical Role of Elders for Today's Church: New Testament Leadership Principles for Equipping Elders"
3,Not bad for a first effort,"I think this is probably one of Foster's first, if not the first novel. For that, he gets a sympathy vote, and for those of you exploring the history of a rather decent SciFi writer, it won't hurt to read this one.Bear in mind though that the characters are not as well-developed or enjoyable as those in later works. And the plot is so subtle, you may accidentally pass right over the climax.You can already see, though, Foster's view of the universe, whose denisons and inhabitants are so varied and strange that discovering who and what they are can be the basis for a unique and readable story.Look for this and other of Foster's books in used bookstores. They do show up ocassionally."
3,Joey Hill is a treasure,"but this is not her best book. I liked it, but wasn't passionate about it. It was something about the hero being so bruised in his former relationship and lacking affection/warmth in this one. He was dominant sexually but not open emotionally and so while he felt like a real person - I think there are probably a lot of male doms out there like him - I didn't warm to him. I guess part of you always wants to fall in love with the hero. I didn't here, so it's only 3 stars, but Joey Hill is an excellent writer and her misses are better than many people's hits."
3,Not her best,"I have read many of Joey Hills books and this is not her best work. I found it interesting by not as exciting as her other books. It seemed to drag on and I found myself skipping over parts of the book. I will continue to buy and read her books, but this was not my favorite."
5,Great pack!!!,"I love this pack, it's small enough to fit in any of my purses yet big enough to put all my supplies in. (eg: test strips, lancets, pen needles, both of my pens, meter, alcohol swabs, and glucose tabs.) I definitely recommend to any diabetic!"
3,Interesting Enough,"The bulk of this book is Plastic Canvas. I don't enjoy plastic canvas myself, but the instructions seemed clear enough and the patterns truely do have some nice items, such as a Grandfather clock and a sofa that really folds out into a bed. Most impressive is a recliner that actually reclines! I'm working on translating the instructions from plastic canvas to some other medium, such as foam and pine, to make the sofa.There are two nice sewing patterns, a few to crochet, and some that combine techniques of sewing with plastic canvas. All in all it's a nice book. I can't justify a higher grade, however, since everything comes off amaturish and unrefined.If you're looking for plastic canvas, try ""Fashion Doll Dream Castle"" by Diane T Ray. There's a lot more variety and the designs are more elaborate."
2,Common Knowledge,"All the recipes in this book are sound and practical, but I was quite disappointed to find nothing interesting or original. All the standards are here: basic bruchetta, bagel chips, mini pizzas, caramel corn, fried ravioli and various cookies. If you are completely new to hors d'oeuvres or cooking in general then this might be a fool-proof way to start. Otherwise, you're highly likely to already have or know good recipes for almost everything in here. Definitely flip through a copy at your library or local bookstore before ordering."
4,"Funki Porcini - Love, Pussycats & Carwrecks","Funki Porcini's second album,Love Pussycats & Carwrecks, starts off with the feline and sensuous ""Purrfect,"" an auspicious start if ever there was one. ""Groover,"" however, starts in with the off-kilter jazz, with some sweeps that sound almost like a dying vacuum cleaner. Indeed, Funki seems to move away from the smoothness of his previous album and more keen on introducing elements of noise. ""Last Song"" has plenty, as does ""12 Points Off Your Licence,"" with its modulated horn stabs and compressed squelches of sound. He seems to be exploring the idea of sound: ""Carwreck"" has a skittering energy, while ""Elephantitus"" wanders from one idea to the next. ""Venus"" hearkens back to the earlier album, though it does embrace some of the chaotic zeitgeist. ""I'm Such a Small Thing"" takes the ambient tack, and ""Going Down"" takes out the album in that mellow, sleepy vein. While not as immediate asHed Phone Sex, this album certainly offers its own pleasures."
1,dangerous - do not buy this stapler,"this tool is very dangerous. anyone who has used a stapler of a standard design should avoid buying this tool. just search the web for ""powershot stapler injury"" and you will find that many users have been inured when using the tool. the tool is the reverse of the standard handheld stapler design, so that the staples exit at what would be the rear of a standard stapler. no matter how many times you read the directions, and no matter how many times you remind yourself that this tool is backwards, this tool will eventually drive a staple into your hand. I pulled a staple out of my ring finger using needle nose pliers yesterday. it was hard to remove, as it was buried in the bone. Lots of blood everywhere. This stapler is designed well, and in fact is a better design than standard staplers. But i don't want to die for it. Either you or a friend or relative will one day pick up this stapler and experience great pain. it is only a matter of time."
1,Avoid This Piece of Junk,"I am not one who leaves reviews, however, in this case I made a exception. To anyone looking for a decent stapler just keep looking because this is not it. Like most on here I have had issues with day one from jamming. And then you pull it away, and the stapler goes off automatically, yea thats safe. The stapler is now at the point you need to squeeze the handle 10-15 times per staple. The only thing you will get from this stapler is a chance to brush up on your swearing."
1,DANGEROUSLY RE-INVENTING THE WHEEL,"Yes, the product review makes sense. By reversing the traditional setup of a staple gun your weight is applied over the exit point giving more control. It makes total sense! But there's a problem: that EVERY OTHER STAPLE GUN most of us have ever used is designed the opposite--the staple exits on the end where the lever angle is located. I borrowed the stapler from a friend and on the very first shot the staple went right through my pinkie bone and warranted a trip to the E.R. Only after did I discover that a friend who used the same staple gun had the same injury. I'm not saying the design is bad in principle, but the Powershot is running against an overwhelming tide in staple-gun design and its causing actual injury in the process."
1,Won't work,"I just purchased this product and filled it with T50 10mm staples, as recommended on the packaging, in the manner described in the instructions. It isn't even jammed -- I can see all the little staples in a row waiting to be stapled -- but it won't work. Brand new, and it doesn't do a damn thing. From the reviews here and elsewhere, I'm definitely getting the impression that it's not worth getting repaired/replaced. I'm returning this thing tomorrow. I wouldn't recommend that anyone else buy one."
1,Antiergonomic.... Bad news.... Will return,"I agree with those who think this is a very dangerous product. The forward action requires much UNtraining. And staples do not go in flush -- ever. It doesn't seem to matter how you poise the gun.And I also stapled my palm -- twice. While working, I operate by feel. The handle angle is just opposite the older duo-fast/arrow types.Obviously they've had some problems, since there are bold arrows in two places, which attempt to warn of the staple exit."
1,not a good staple gun,I've had this stapler for a year and its jams all the freakin time....very annoying. I m now in the market for a better one. please dont buy this.
4,A REAL SOLID TOOL,This is a real solid tool.With a wide range of staples available it should fit just about everyone.I bought mine when powershot was making them for black and decker.(exact same tool)I havent fired any brads with it butI have gone through some staples.It hasent jammed yet. Mine didnt come with the adapter or the cool little case and I paid a lot more.This one is a real winner.It is well worth the money.You wont be sorry
5,Excellent Heavy Duty Stapler,"The forward action of this hand stapler is by far the best that I have ever used.!! I use to put off the wiring jobs and other chores that would require using the typical staple gun, or worse, hammering those itty-bitty staples/brads. But with this staple gun, very little forward pressure is needed to trigger the shot, AND there is very little recoil, which is my main complaint of the ""normal"" staple gun.Great for laying wire and installing fiberglass insulation, the forward action will firmly seat the staple into the wood. The 9/16"" brads are NOT seated entirely into the wood, but in my case, that is what I want. I use the brad stapler for preperation of thin wood for ""stack cutting"" scroll saw projects. The hand held PowerShot makes the prep time for the thin wood a breeze, and easy, AND it doesn't tire the hand.Easily fires staples flush, easy on the hand, HIGHLY recommend the PowerShot 5700KB Forward Action"
1,Dangerous product..,This product is very dangerous. It jammed up every time I tried to use it and shot out staples even when the trigger was not pulled. I have reported this to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and I strongly urge others to do the same.
2,Not worth the trouble,"This book is not helpful when trying to find a degree program that matches your interests. Only for a handful of universities do they provide the masters programs offered by the school.We looked up the NIU college of performing arts and the ENTIRE entry was copied from the NIU college of liberal arts and sciences...What does having a plant molecular biology center have to do with performing arts?Most of the book is just basic information: phone numbers, addresses, and requirements for admissions. But this information is useless to me unless I intened to call every single school and find out what programs they offer. It's easier to just search over the interenet!"
1,Useless,"I was expecting something more along the line of what the Princeton Review makes for undergraduate colleges or med schools ... not at all. This book is useless. They basically provide you with contact information, which I can look that up online for free. All they do is list programs and do not include any helpful information about them such as admission statistics or student opinions."
4,"Ho, Ho, Ho. It's for Christmas.","Good and fast service, plus the items were well packed. I thought they might arrice squished (sp). Thanks you and Happy Christmas."
3,"Eh, they're okay","I've always been a bit indifferent to the Ho Ho. I don't know what it is about them, but they just are NOT a favorite of mine. They're sort of a lighter Hostess snack cake, and therefore one must consume several in order to be even remotely satisfied. There are numerous Hostess products that are preferable."
5,Movado,The watch arrived quickly and is as beautiful as I thought it would be. It looks like a piece of jewelry vs just a watch. I chose it for that reason and because it looked like it would go very well with my platinum ring and it does!
5,Armitron Women's 753415CHTT NOW Two-Tone Stainless Steel Expansion Watch,"I got this watch for Christmas. The picture does not do it justice. It's very lovely, a lot prettier and attractive than the illustration shows. I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. As another reviewer stated, you do have to have small wrists to comfortably wear this watch."
4,Introduction to the American Legal System,This book is a great introduction to the basics of law. It covers the basic necessary to understand our legal system.
2,Good Idea-Big Disapointment,"The idea behind this book is very good. A comparative history of vaqueros, cowboys and buckaroos is needed. These three groups share much in common but they are nevertheless historically distinct. I was hoping to understand the uniquess of each experience by learning about the common threads that tie the three groups together.Unfortunately, the authors were not up to task. The authors are amateurs who share a great love for the subject. Unfortunately, there is large chasm between an enthusiast and a professional author. Sadly,the writing and analysis was weak. While reading the book, I wanted them to succeed but in the end, this was a book written by enthusiasts. This book only proves that gifted amateurs are a rare bird."
5,I liked the ending..shocking,"superb plot and i liked the way john moon's helplessness and his view of unsympathetic , cruel world were captured in the words. the ending was a total surprise to me and it goes with my line of thinking that things not always end up with black and white and we ought to see grey ends like this."
3,WHAT?,"I fell into the trap of judging a book by its cover, and was sorely disappointed. Twice, I threw the book across the room, disgusted. Twice, I picked it back up and continued to read, morbidly fascinated. It was like rubbernecking at a terrible car accident, not wanting to see the devastation but not able to drag your glance away....With a stronger stomach, I am sure I could have appreciated the quality of the author's writing. However, I mainly found myself repulsed by the book's content. Strictly personal. I'll hang on to it and give it another read someday to see if I was wrong."
5,Best sander Period!,Do you want one sander for hardwoods or stubborn areas; then this is it. Forget the little orbitals and buy this half sheet sander. I have owned mine for over 10 years and it still works as good as day one. The dust will fly and the orbits are outstanding. This is my time saver in the shop and one of my favorite tools. Make sure you secure your boards as this sander has some serious power in both amps and orbits. Have fun!
3,Disappointed,"I found that this doesn't fit well, and doesn't line up as it should. Pleasure, but not what I expected."
1,A waste of money,this product is a total waste of your money. it isn't contoured correctly at all and is actually pretty uncomfortable. the batteries are an odd size and therefore hard to replace. Save the money and get something out of the Rabbit line instead.
1,Arrived DOA,"This arrived DOA, I tried to reorder but it was going to be a MONTH before it would be available..."
1,"worked 2 times, then died","This toy was great the first time, and good the second time.....after that it just died. Tried new batteries and everything, but no go....would not buy again"
5,OPUS 2,"BRASSENS continue where he left us with his second lp.His réputation rapidly grows in FRANCE with songs like BANC PUBLIC and PUTAIN DE TOI displaying his original style with subversive lyrics accompagnied only by another guitar and a bass.The list of later FRENCH folksingers who were influenced by these recordings is endless.BRASSENS when he started was really a sensation.It is worth mentionning that all the songs of the first two lps were written before his official debut in 1952.Like LE GORILLE from the previous lp,PUTAIN DE TOI wasn't allowed radio playing at all.We've come a long way since then.Bonus tracks are unnecessary,apart from a second hilarious live version of PUTAIN DE TOI,in which BRASSENS is clearly enjoying himself."
2,Reader Beware,"This book is fairly well researched. However, it is poorly written and poorly edited -- ""pour"" substituted for ""pore,"" ""to"" substituted for ""too,"" and so on. On whole, it comes off as an amateurish job; it looks to be self-published. It would have been good to have known this before I ordered it. I expect more for my money."
4,"All together this is a good book, with a few exeptions.","This is a good book if you are a Nez fan or a Monkee fan. Although my oppinion, along with a friend whom also read it agree that this book is more of an attack on Nez. It tends to focus on all his bad qualities and rarely anything good about him. -Rick Mente Nez and Monkee fanatic"
1,worst book ever,"It's not even an issue of it being the worst Monkees-related book. It is simply the worst book I have ever read. The writing is awful. The book is littered with typos, tense disagreements, childish psuedo-observations and misplaced jokes. There is no cohesive narrative to speak of and the facts are pointless and tabloid worthy. This is the first time that I have ever actually felt sorry for an author for the choices that they have made. I was actually cringing while reading the book. Wow..it is so amatuerish and poorly rendered. Reading this book is like reading the worst junior high essay possible and feeling cheated because you really care about the topic. here is an amazing chapter cliff-hanger.PAGE 141""he would never again remind people of the ""monkee"" known as Mike from the TV show. I'm certain the suspense is killing you by now. Michael grew a beard. end chapter"
1,This is pure trash...mispelled!,"look, I do not worship Mr. Nesmith, but most of the info in this book has been stolen verbatim from other sources without telling. That's called robbery. This book is from an ex-fan and if you are going to read this tripe, remember that. The original thoughts from the author read like they were put to paer from a 10 year old. Take a class in writing before you do in the future. This author has always had unkind words about the whole ""Monkees"" franchise, yet calls herself a big fan! Make up your mind! Don't waste your money on this. If you want to read it, find it in a library like I did. Even the photos are typical. Leave the writing to authors Ms. Randi."
4,Two thumbs up!,"Randi has done a marvelous job in bringing us a complete look at Nez' life. The editing does leave a little to be desired, but over all the book is exceedingly well done. For those who complain about a misspelled word here or there, even John Grisham, Mark Twain, and Piers Anthony don't have perfect editors. :) Good job, Randi!!!!"
3,What happened to proof-reading?,"I have always been a bit of a Michael Nesmith fan. Therefore, I really enjoyed the facts and information that this book has to offer. Unfortunately, the book and poorly written. Worst of all, it contains the most typos and errors that I have ever seen in a book. The book is interesting, but the mistakes are very distracting."
1,Totally Boring,"I have been a Mike Nesmith fan for 13 years (im 26 but ended up in the kids section so ignore the age field!!) and was really looking forward to finding out about his life, him as a person, and exciting Monkees related stories. This book was full of boring business stuff and gave me little emotional insight. I appreciate that some things are personal but thats the point of this sort of book. I felt like it was written by piecing together newspaper articles or something. There was a shortage of photographs too (possibly just as well considering the hideous beard. Generally it was sadly lacking. There must be more to a strong character like Mike Nesmith than this? Maybe its an English thing but this just didnt satisfy my curiosity!!"
2,This book is more of a research paper than a biography.,"Total Control reads more like a college research paper than it does a biography. Lots of facts, summarized and outlined, it would make a good reference book for Trivial Pursuit. As a biography it leaves a lot to be desired. Made up mainly of sound bites from various articles, the book feels manufactured and sterile. The author's effort to round out the biography by interviewing friends and family falls short due to the mostly negative portrayal painted of Michael Nesmith. I recommend Total Control to anyone who is interested in the history of 60's Rock Icons. I do not recommend Total Control for anyone looking for insight into the man who is Michael Nesmith. I was left wondering if the image presented by the book was truly factual, and if it is why would anyone want to be his ""number one fan""?"
3,"Well researched, but poorly written","I was fascinated by the details of his various lawsuits (divorce and corporate) and the inner-workings of the Pacific Arts Corp. But everything written portrayed Nez in a negative light. I would have preferred a more unbiased account of his life. There were obvious holes in various parts of the ""ographies"", and none of Nez's bandmates (Monkees, 1st National Band, concert musicians) were interviewed....which I believe would be essential. Proofreading would have been helpful, and the writer's skills are subpar at best. Only devoted Nez/Monkee fans would find interest...."
1,Nature's Gate ruins a good shampoo,"I had settled on this shampoo as my personal favorite because of its natural ingredients, moisturizing properties, and the way it left my hair feeling. It also smelled great.Sadly, I can no longer recommend this product. Earlier this year (2006) Nature's Gate reformulated its Organics shampoos, subordinating most of their natural ingredients to chemical ingredients and adding several more chemicals. Most disturbing, the company added parabens (methylparaben and propylparaben), which many health-conscious consumers don't want in their body care products. The absence of parabens in the original product was a key reason why I chose this shampoo to begin with.I'm very disappointed that Nature's Gate has adulterated what was one of the best shampoos I ever used. The new formula doesn't even smell the same. As far as I'm concerned, Nature's Gate is more interested in profits than people's health. I've switched to another brand."
3,Extensive but incomplete,"This extensive collection with its 18 tracks provides a good overview of Gaynor's career but inexplicably omits two of her greatest hits: I Am What I Am and Never Can Say Goodbye. It does contain her other great hits: the anthemic I Will Survive, Reach Out I'll Be There and How High The Moon plus minor successes like Let Me Know (I Have A Right) and Anybody Wanna Party. Gaynor's recipe for success was her powerful rousing voice, the right melodic songs and that addictive disco beat. Not all the other tracks here are equally memorable although I like her cover of Walk On By and tracks like Can't Fight The Feeling, Honey Bee and This Love Affair. The album Ten Best is a better buy as it contains all the greatest hits, including the aforementioned I Am What I Am and Never Say Goodbye. Otherwise The Collection is fine as it showcases one of the great singers of the disco era whose work has stood the test of time."
2,can't use it,sides come all the way up to the arm pit. not usable at all. doesn't hold up. will find someone to give it to I suppose. Wouldn't buy it again. No way to return. Guess you take your chances when you buy things this way.
4,"Good value, runs slightly small","My band size is 34, however since so many reviewers said this item ran small I decided to take a chance on a 36. I'm glad I did because the 36 is SNUG. The front fastening is a single row of seven eyelets so ""letting it out"" or using a bra extender is not option. The 36 is comfortable under the bust so I wouldn't go to a 38, but ideally I'd have ordered up one cup size too. The bra runs small allover, not just in the band.I find the bra comfortable: the front darts and center closure keep The Ladies where they should be with minimal adjustments over the course of the day. My single gripe is the material: the 80% Nylon, 20% Lycra Spandex blend can start to feel like scratchy pantyhose if you work up a sweat. A touch of cotton for breathability would have edged this closer to 5-stars.At full retail price I might drop this to 3-stars, however for 40% (or more) off the value overshadows the shortcomings."
3,so-so,"I have some bra's that don't have padding and the underwires came out of them-- this bra wasn't even as comfortable as they are....close... but just not quite. I wanted it for something to sleep in, but I don't think I could have slept in it without being extremely tired- and even then it probably would have given me fitful, restless sleep from aggravation. reviewed. :)"
3,"Straps too short, at least in larger size","About what I expected, and I might update the review after a break-in period.PROS: comfortable fabric, like having front hooks to easily change how bundled up these babies are. In other words, if I have to answer the door or go to the mailbox while still in a leisure bra, I can hook all the hooks and I won't bounce like I'm bra-less.CONS: Straps are SHORT with NO PADS. The no pads wouldn't be a problem if the straps weren't so short. Again, maybe a break-in period will help."
1,size 40DD is more like a 34D,Everything about this bra was much smaller than the size it claimed to be.I was very dissappointed and dissatisfied with the purchase.
4,"Very soft, nice material, order size larger!","This is a really nice looking bra. I ordered it to wear after my lumpectomy and I think it would've been perfect had I ordered one band size bigger. I am a 42C and the 42 B/C/D is a little tight around. I agree with other reviewers to size up on the band size. Still recommend though, good price."
3,Good leisure bra,I purchase this bra to wear after breast reduction surgery. I had a get a size larger but other then that I like the bra. Sometimes I wear it in side out because of the seams. Thn it is really comfortable.
3,uni -boob!!,"This bra is somewhat comfortable, Its not completely comfortable because I'm a DDD and my boobs are pushed together.I was under the impression that the front closure helped to separate and I could wear to bed and help avoid some of those cleavage lines.I may try wearing to bed, but I wouldn't even wear around the house."
2,very skimpy,"Unfortunately, for me, this bra did not work out at all. I ordered the same size I always wear and could barely get it on. Cup size and all over fit way too small. I returned both bras."
3,Looks nice but TOO Small and NO Support,This item looks very nice in the picture but I ordered 2 different sizes thinking I would get a good fit. BOTH my normal size and one size larger are WAY TOOOOOOOOO SMALL. The bra offers NO support for a mature full figured woman. I will say that the straps are nice and comfortable and the front closure is very nice and the fabric is very nice and soft. HOWEVER I wish I had read the return policy before I ordered because you can only get a refund if you can return the product in it's original UNOPENED condition. How you know if it will fit without opening the PLASTIC bag it comes in and trying it on I do not know. I would NOT recommend ordering bra's off the internet because you can't return them if they don't fit. I will be donating these to our local women's shelter.
2,Bra for someone with limited upper arm dextrity,"The bra size does not relect normal bra sizes. I am small sized and yet I could not use the bra even with the help of another person. The design was nice,"
2,Only if you like being tightly wrapped........,"My regular bra size is 38DD. At the recommendation of several reviewers I ordered this bra one size larger in a 40DD-F. I think a 42 might be better because I had intended this as a sleep bra and the bottom elastic is a bit tighter than I would like in a sleep bra. However, the real problem is that the cup size runs very small. If you place your hands over your breasts and press tightly to your chest, you will have an idea of the way this bra supports. The stretch fabric crushes my boobs to my ribs, creating huge cleavage in the middle and with a surprising amount of overflow ending up at my sides - effectively under my arms. I think this may be a contributing factor in other reviewers' complaints that the bra is uncomfortable under their arms. I cannot recommend this bra to full-busted women. It does immobilize the girls, but not comfortably."
5,awesome bra!,"Loved this bra, really comfy and a great sleep/around the house bra. I do wear it a lot when I go out just because its so comfortable! highly recommended."
2,Smaller than the size advertised,I wear a professionally sized DD bra which is what I bought. This bra looks like I am wearing pasties. It is very small cupped and not the DD-size it claims to be. It is very soft though. I returned it.
4,"Good bra, decent fit","I really like this bra for lazing around the house, but I also don't feel weird if I go to the mailbox and see someone. At first it was a little tight through the band, but after a few wears it was great. I put this on after wearing a regular bra all day and feel so much better. Obviously it is leaisure and doesn't ""lift"" but rather just ""cradles"" for comfort."
2,Glamorise leisure bra,This is uncomfortable -- don't like the fabric and it is cut for a very broad shouldered woman. I much prefer the cloth and cut of the Leading Lady brand
3,Very Nice But Seems To Run Small,The bra was nice but very small. I had read the other reviews but didn't realize how small it ran. I had to return it and decided not to reorder.
1,Sizing way off,You mine as well call the 34 a 32. I could hook it but it is so snug I would never be able to wear it.
2,Itchy band,Wish I couldv'e loved this more but the band was so itchy! Everything else about this bra was great. You need to go up a size though.
1,not the bra to buy for a nursing home resident,"I ordered this bra for my mother, hoping it would be easier for her to dress herself. When I received it, they said it could not be returned if worn. I understand that, I guess, but I immediately returned it without taking it to my mother, because if it didn't fit, I couldn't have returned it. So I don't know if it would have worked or not."
3,I should have listened to the bad reviews,"I purchased this before going on a two-week out-of-country trip. I have tendinitis in my left shoulder, and putting on a bra is difficult. I have a couple of front-opening bras and they have been easier to wear, but I needed a couple more. I purchased this in white and black.First time I put them on, I did feel they were comfortable. But they would not stay up on my shoulder! One of the problems with my tendinitis is that my shoulder isn't square, so there is a risk that the straps will slide down. However, this bra slid down on both sides, and it was uncomfortable to wear them. They otherwise held my ample bosom well in place, but they were so uncomfortable I took them off after 30-40 minutes and found another bra.Stay away from this bra if you aren't completely square in your shoulders. This should not be used as a sports-bra either, it will not hold things in place. Do not recommend them."
4,Snug but comfortable,"I wear a D cup and this bra comes in size ""BCD"", which I ordered. I can wear the bra, but would be a little more comfortable if the cup was a tiny bit larger. I think if it were made in a ""CD"" cup it would fit better. It is a very comfortable bra and I like the front closure style better than the Playtex 18 hour bra."
3,Its going back!!!,"AFTER READING PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS REVIEW ON THIS BRA ABOUT IT FITTING TOO TIGHT......i TOOK THEIR ADVISE AND PURCHASED ONE SIZE LARGER THAN i NORMALLY WOULD...LO AND BEHOLD....THEY WERE RIGHT!! iT WAS SO TIGHT IT PUSHED MY BOOBS UP INTO MY ARMPITS!!! I COULD NEVER HAVE COMFORTABLY WORE IT. I DISLIKE HAVING TO PAY RETURN SHIPPING, THO. sEEMS LIKE AMAZON COULD HELP US OUT IN THIS AREA.THE BRA WAS NICE IN APPEARANCE AND SEEMED TO BE GOOD QUALITY, ALSO NICE AND SOFT...BUT THAT FIT IS JUST SO BAD!IT IS NOW SITTING ON MY KITCHEN COUNTER ALL PACKAGED UP AND READY TO TAKE TO POST OFFICE TOMORROW TO SEND BACK. I DID GET VERY FAST DELIVERY, THO.I JUST CAN'T HANDLE MY GIRLS BEING SMASHED!!!!"
1,Glamorise Bra,Terrible fit. Extremly samll and I had to return it. I do not recommend this product unless you order a couple of sizes larger.
3,Not what I need,"The bra fits okay, if you don't mind a uniboob. I bought it because I was having a problem with my shoulder and could no longer deal with back hook bras. Six hooks are not easy to deal with when your shoulder is compromised and getting the back to be at the right level is no easier than a back hook bra. So, if you are looking for a bra that is easier to put on than a back hook bra, this is not the one."
2,Not what I expected at all,We have been searching for a metal headboard for over two months and wanted something that would go along with the wrought iron decor of the house/bedroom - this was definitely not it.The images show the frame as being slightly more slender than normal but what we recieved was a headboard with brackets the thickness of pencils and nowhere near the color we expected. The color is gray...literally it looks like the headboard was gold and they just brushed a gray brown paint over the top...it makes the bed look very modern and almost impossible to match to anything in our home or to find anything in stores that would match - and defeats the purpose of saving money by just replacing a headboard rather than replacing an entire bedroom suite!
4,"decent, but...","just got this in the mail today, and i'm more or less happy with it. the main complaints seem to be a) lack of separated speakers, which doesn't bother me, and b) low-quality speakers, which, as a non-audiophile, whatever they used works fine for me. sound is a bit muffled, but i imagine that comes from the speakers being in a small, compact cabinet.the one INEXCUSABLE absence, however, is the lack of outputs. so you can never wire this to your home stereo or listen through the solitude of headphones. maybe this option wasn't found in the stack players of the 50's and 60's, but these days it is a must."
4,Very Good Replica & Sounds Better Than The Original,I'm very pleased with the Crosley Stack-O-Matic. It's an excellent replica of the original except that I believe it sounds better. The stacking feature works flawlessly and the portability is a real plus. Competititve price with immediate shipping. Very satisfied.
5,"Learning history, having fun","Here's a neat little book that combines learning with a guessing game. There are 10 chapters in the book, each dealing with a major American historical event or theme (The Civil War, Old West, Military establishments, etc.), and then within each chapter there are 10 sites listed: first you have to try to guess what the site is by reading through a list of clues, and then there's a fairly lengthy description of the site. It's interesting, informative, and a lot of fun, too."
3,Very good at times but too long.,"When his father dies, Jonas Cord Jr inherits his father's business empire, Cord Explosives, and before long he's also involved in aviation and the movie business. Cord's story, told in first person narrative, is the frame of the novel, which also tells the stories of people Cord gets to know throughout his life, including Nevada Smith and Rina Marlowe, creating a rather complex, nonlinear narrative, spanning at least four decades and running over 600 pages. It works quite well, up to a point, but about two thirds into the book we're again introduced to new characters, David Woolf and later Jennie Denton, and get to read their whole life histories, and by then the novel starts to feel a bit too disjointed. Although the characters are interesting, and all the stories tie up nicely together the pace suffers from too many protagonists. If the book had been shorter, with some of the weaker parts removed, it would have been great but as it is, I'd give it a 3+ rating."
3,Did not met expectations,"This book's description said it was in very well kept condition ""like new"". Nothing close to that. As far as the book selection and content is concerned, it is highly recommended for everyone who's about 17-18 and older. Adventure, Passion, Money, Power, Lover, Work, Business and Business compose the book's narrative about the life of Howard Hughes."
5,became a fan of rock because of arnel,"the only songs i know and love from journey is open arms and faithfully,now i enjoy all the music.live in manila is the best,i recommend this to everyone,i'll buy blue ray when it comes out.i bought mine at sam's club,cheap on a quality concert/dvd."
4,Great concert - unfocused video,"I would love to give this DVD a 5-star rating based on the sound quality and the concert. But something isn't right. At first it appears the video is washed out - in a haze. OK so there are fog machines on stage and the picture quality takes a hit. But even at it's best, the colors are blah and nothing is really in focus. Did they makes this from a VHS transfer or just use lower quality cameras?It's standard DVD format so I was not expecting blu-ray sharpness and color definition. But usually, standard definition video close-ups are sharp even when the audience and wide shots are fuzzy. The video is consistent regardless of scene. I'm guessing they shot this video with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen) and then cropped it into a widescreen video. Maybe it looks OK on TV, but on a projector screen it reminds me of videos from the early 90's.In any case it's great to hear the music of Journey again.What a high energy performance!"
2,Overpowering guitar from Schon,"Pineda's voice is excellent and powerful, but Schon's guitar dominates the mix to the point that this is nearly unlistenable for me. This seems like nothing new as I saw Journey live in the 80's and walked away with the same impression and disappointment in the mix. Don't get me wrong: I love rock guitar and play guitar myself. However, there is something to be said for a balanced mix where the other band members can shine too. Journey's recordings always had great vocal harmonies and they are lost in this mix. When Schon stops playing for a moment, you can hear a glimpse of the melodies and harmonies. Then he comes back in and completely drowns everything, but hey you can hear every palm thunk, string slide, and bum note out of his guitar! Woohoo!"
3,"Nice, but","I recommended it, but 3 stars, Why? Cool show, excellent play list, and amazing camera shots. No lyrics""subtitles"" on screen, no dts, the 5.1 sound is so,so,so if you have a nice home theater you will miss the sound. Arnel is an amazing singer, Dean sings in some songs (still they ride, mother, father are really for Dean), the beginning of open arms is great. 2:20 running time, 16:9."
1,32.00 no way,Why would you pay 32.00 for something that you can get for 10.00 at walmart. Don't waste your money PLUS it will be out on bluray before Christmas. WAIT FOR IT!
5,Simply Amazing,Look - I get the die hard fans who won't be happy that Steve Perry isn't with the band anymore. DO yourself a favor and open your ears...this is the tightest I've heard a live performance in a long time. Well worth the money and well worth watching over and over again. I'm going to see them next month and as a musician myself can't wait to hear it live! Accept the change and enjoy the music.
2,Poor sound mix,"I just viewed the concert on the HD concert channel, ""Palladia"". I have read all of the reviews of the poor video quality but it was crisp and clear on Palladia.My complaint is it sounds like Neil Schon did the final audio mix and mastering. I tried listening in 5.1, stereo and other settings with the same results. Schon's guitar dominates the mix way way way too much especially on the right channel. The drums are lost and muddy and the keys are almost nonexistant. ""Seperate Ways"" is a keyboard driven song and I couldn't even hear them over the guitar.The new singer sings great but even his vocals are overshadowed by the guitar and like another review said the backup vocals were weak.I was wondering if others noticed this on their DVD copies of the concert before I make the decision to buy or pass???"
4,Blu-ray is better than the DVD,I have the original 2 disc set of this DVD they featured at Sam's Club for $10. I thought the regular DVD had a mediocre audio track and it seemed to bury the vocal tracks somewhere that was not mixed for listeners. I read that this Blu-ray was an improvement in audio and video quality. It is a major improvement over the DVD but the percussion seems muffled and muddy and the lead guitar is featured a little too much in compared to balance with the rest of the instrument mix. It is not as good as some Blu-ray audio quality I own but Blu-ray does not always guarantee an improved product that is worth the expense.The cost of this Blu-ray was right on the threshold of maximum of what I will pay. I like Journey and this is a pretty good representation of their song catalog with good video quality and decent audio.
2,Sound mix a disappointment,"I'm a big Journey fan and was looking forward to the Blu Ray version of this concert. I have a 7.1 home theater in a large room, system calibrated with Audyssey Pro. Unfortunately, all audio options suffer from the same problem. The center channel vocals take a back seat to the left and right main speakers in this mix. New lead singer's vocals are rather muted and overpowered by the rest of the channels.Perhaps I expected more, but when compared to say the Eagles and the David Gilmour discs, the poor mix really shows. I put on various other concerts in to ensure my system was not causing the problem. In fact, the above mentioned concerts sounded as great as always.For the price, this disk is a disappointment."
4,a little better than I expected...,"being an average journey fan I have several albums and some videos. I was of course dissappointed when they lost steve as lead singer, but arnel is a worthy replacement so the nostalgic fans like myself are not too let down. his younger fire for the music and performing has helped keep the journey fire alive. also not forgetting the wonderful contribution to drumming and singing from deen castronovo. this video concert was a joy to watch and probably watch again. sound and picture were pretty good."
2,"Good tunes, video, bad audio","The audio on this DVD sounds extremely compressed. Listening to it on my laptop, the volume was nowhere near loud enough. On my home theater system the volume sounds like there is some limiter in place. Like FM radio hitting its limit.The video clips online are much more ""live"", though bootleg in quality."
3,Journey Past The Prime,"No matter what some of you say, Steve Perry was the greatest and last voice of Journey! Nice camera work and nice concert. But can't top the Real Journey!"
1,Bad mixing,"I saw them in concert a couple years ago and the mixing was terrible, same thing on the blu ray."
5,"20 years of use, no complaints, buying two more","I'm not sure exactly how long ago I first purchased these stands, but it was about 20 years ago. I got 3, one got stolen during a gig, and I just purchased two more. Need I say more? No, but I will.They collapse more compactly than other stands I've borrowed, so they're really easy to stow in your gear cases, car or closet, and you can carry a couple in one hand (when I get the new ones I just ordered, I'll find out if I can carry 3 at once in one hand). After 20 years, the rubber on the neck fork is finally wearing a bit, but nothing else shows sign of failing in the foreseeable future. I haven't had a guitar hanging on the stands 24/7, but they've certainly been used over those 20 years. It's such a simple, elegant solution for a portable guitar stand, superior to anything I see in guitar stores nowadays. My guitar/bass collection has grown, and I was pleasantly surprised that they still make these great stands, so I bought a couple more."
5,The best stand ever.,This is my second review for the best guitar stand ever made. Very hard to tip over in case of an accident and it folds up small for easy transport. I've had one for 20 years and still use it along with the 3 other stands I've purchased. Get it you won't regret it.
3,I hope theres a better text out there,"Significant coverage of deriving equations. While important, I feel too much time spent in working through equation development resulting too few example problems and insufficient application discussion."
2,broken books,"Honestly, this book is good if you need spells, want new spells, or just want to have a massive field of spells. More honestly, however, is the uber broken fashion of this book. About 25% of the spells are not thoroughly explaned, or at least not to level of specificity my gaming circle would appreciate. On a personal level, I fell there are much more than are necessary, taking from actual roleplaying, and pumping all the focus on the magic aspect. And most of all, many are too powerful for the level they describe when comparing their stats to the PHb spell list. In my opinion, most of these spells would be more appropriate for plot weapons, intelligent weapons, artifacts, or as godly favors/empowerments. Toward that end, I see great potential for this book, but on the whole, is is overpowered and lopsided for the role playing game."
4,Excellent Resource,A must-have for all D&D gamers... it adds a lot of flavor to the arcane/divine spellcasters gaming experience.
4,Good d&d resource,The Spell Compendium is a good resource for 3.5 d&d. There are a lot of spells in here that will find their way onto casters' lists. I think it strikes a pretty good balance in terms of game balance.
4,A Nice New Set of Fresh Spells,"As far as I'm concerned, there can't be too many spells to choose from. That's why I really like books like this for it's concice collection of new spells. My only complain is that the Spell List by Level is on the back, when all the other books have it in the front. Oh Well. Otherwise the spells are clever, useful and original. Great as an addition to any campaign."
5,Spells!!,The fact that this book is a compilation of spells from various sources makes it worth having. This book does not reprint the spells from the Player's Handbook; which is good because it would have just been wasted pages reprinting what's already in a book that you need to have in order to play the game. This is a welcomed addition to my D&D library.
3,A let down.,"I should start by saying that I believed this product was, infact, a compilation of pretty much every single spell from all the books and dragon magazines of the last few years. Thus, I bought it to use as a quick reference for ANY SPELL. Unforunately it is not. While it does update some 3.0 spells, and gives some descriptions of some of the spells in the core books, it does not, infact, present most of the core book spells again.Therefore, it serves to update some spells that you might have used from various campaign settings and introduced several more but as a collection of all spells, it sadly fails."
3,Limited Usefulness,"When I think spell 'compendium' I think of a volume that contains all spells in the Dnd 'verse period. The whole point of a spell compendium in my mind is to have all the spells in the game easily accessible and organized in one book. Therefor this book falls short for two reasons:a) though it lists spells alphabeticially, it is not indexed.b) it contains all the spells in the game...except for ones in the players handbook. Granted, this volume does reduce the ammount of books open for a spellcaster choosing their ideal spell combinations, but why WOC didn't go the distance to make a ""one stop choose-your-magic-here"" book is beyond me.Upside: lots of fun spells. But that should be obvious from the title."
4,Solid place to get some spells,"Like the title says this is a compendium of spells. It covers the 'Races of' series, the 'Complete' series and several other titles that Wizards has put out over the years. While having all the books is nice, it made it difficult to use them. However, finally having one solid book to lug around instead of 9 others is nice.They renamed some spells, eliminating some of the creator names from the spells and then there were also some general renamings to make some more sense. The format is the same as every other spell presented by Wizards.Overall this is a nice title to have to not have to lug a lot of othe rbooks around. Unfortunately, there wasn't any really new content in this book. I think it would have been much better if they would have included everything they have in it and more new material."
4,Everything you could possibly want in a spell compendium. However...,"After pouring over the Spell Compendium, I must say that WOTC put together a fantastic collection of spells. The organization of the spells being at the end of the book really doesn't detract in any way from the book although I have heard other people criticize WOTC for doing so. Once you know it's there, it's there. Done deal. However, the only reason I don't give this a full rating of '5' is because it truly IS NOT a Spell Compendium. Were WOTC to put ALL of the currently published spells into this book, I would still have bought it even it had been $10 more. A true compendium of spells should include all the spells currently available in print from WOTC. The Players Handbook includes spells that should have been carried over to the Spell Compendium. So I'll rate it a '4' and thank WOTC for my Almost But Not Quite Complete Spell Compendium."
5,Essential for DMs and players alike,"While WoTC churns out more and more fluff based books (Complete Champion?), this book is all crunchy goodness. An absolute must for any caster player, it also provides endless amusement for DMs who like to throw odd puzzles at thier players. Much fun!!"
2,annoying to use,"I have the eBible Discover Edition. I upgraded to new computers, and this product requires very annoying registration and requires you to keep track of your confirmation code for ever and ever. Very annoying in my opinion. I do not think I will ever buy any media that uses the Libronix system. I have better things to do that keep their confirmation code on a floppy as they recommend.And if you do not register within 45 days, you are unable to continue using the software you just paid good money for."
1,Would Not Install On Windows XP MCE,"When this program arrived, I tried to install it on my computer, running Windows XP MCE, and it simply would not install. I tried everything I could think of, but it would not install.Amazon, as usual, was very conscientious about facilitating the return and credit to my account.Since I was unable to run the program, the one star may be unfair. The program is promoted as being compatible with Windows XP, so I have no idea whether or not the particular copy I got was at fault, or if the problem affects all copies of the program; or the fact that I'm using Windows XP MCE was the source of the problem.Another Bible study program that I ordered at the same time, installed and runs perfectly."
5,Oven rack puller pusher,"This a a great product. for heavy items, having 2 of these is even better -- one on each side of rack. This saves lots of burns and enables you to easily pull items from the oven to check them and then to push them back in. No more burned fingers! I thought it was the dumbest thing I had ever seen when someone gave it to me -- then I used it! I love it and am buying for friends. Anyone who does a lot of baking will love this once they use it."
5,very helpful,"As a non-financial manager that had only learned the financial aspects of management ""by osmosis"" (as the authors say), I've felt this book closed several gaps of financial knowledge, with excellent to-the-point explanations, always backed up with realistic cases. I feel much more confident to make some decisions now, and to defend my points against my CFO (and know when to agree with his). I strongly recommend that book to every manager without an academic background in finance."
5,Must read for the TBI community,"An excellent book about the life of a TBI survivor and how brain injury not only changes the life of the survivor, but also the life of his/her family. Crimmins writes with clarity about her husband's accident, rehab, and subsequent deficits. She pulls no punches when she describes HMOs and their lack of caring and understanding. Being the mother of a TBI survivor I can certainly relate to much of what Crimmins has to say about Alan's cognitive problems. This book should be read by anyone who works with TBI survivors and their families. Unless one walks in the shoes of a TBI caregiver it is very difficult to understand what we experience. Where is the Mango Princess? gives a firsthand account of what many of us go through on a daily basis."
5,harrowing and real,"Having read several brain injury survivor memoirs, I was initially reluctant to read one written by a family member of a survivor - how could they possibly understand the experience? But Cathy Crimmins shows us 'the other side' - how the survivor can challenge everyone's tolerance with their suddenly bizarre, unsavoury, often hostile, and sadly unintended new behaviour and limitations. She doesn't sanitise the ordeal, but rather just tells it as she endured it. I'd love to read a companion book by her husband Alan (the brain injury survivor she writes about), for a look at how different the worlds of survivor and carer can be. And how about a sequel Cathy?"
5,Go girlfriend; this book rules!,"Author Cathy Crimmins wisely uses her incredible sense of humor to spin her true tale of what happens when a loved one becomes brain injured. Along with the laughs, she'll probably make you cry, too. But that's what makes it a great book! Oh, and all doctors should have this on their list of required reading. Oh, and all HMO administrators, nurses, teachers, teens, employers, bankers, etc. should be required to read this book. Oh, what the heck, everybody should read this book. Perhaps the world would be a more compassionate place if everyone read this book."
5,Where is the mango princess?,My son recently suffered a brain injury. This book helped me more than anything else that I have read. It also made me laugh and cry. It was really great to know that I was not alone in my struggle to help my son recover. I loved this book.
5,A serious subject told with humor and wit,Cathy Crimmins wrote a remarkable book. She educates us about serious brain injuries while letting us see into her soul. I love her sense of humor - This is a must read.
3,Computer Case is ok.,"The leather on this case is not soft and feels like it's plastic leather (or Pleather). However, the case comes with a tag that claims it's Genuine Leather. The size is perfect for me at 20L x 12W x 10D inches. These measurements are approximate. The shoulder strap is quite comfortable if you flip it over and use the top part to rest on your shoulder. The side intended to rest on your shoulder is harder. The compartment for the laptop is wider than needed but the multiple pockets and other compartments more than make up for the bulky design of the bag. If you are on a budget or need a temporary bag for the upcoming school season, this case will fit your needs."
2,Not Schulman's best.,"As with so many first novels, this one is derivative. Although it has some elements that become Schulman staples, Schulman really comes into her own with her second book, After Delores."
5,Easy to follow for novices,I've never rebuilt a carb before and used this manual to successfully rebuild a carb on a 1986 Merc 20 HP. Clear instructions and relevant pictures. I can now proceed with confidence onto other repairs/tune ups.
3,Not really thrilled with it.,"First of all i understand there were alot of years and sizes listed. But, it made you guess alot. b/c it would say things like your part will match one of these photos. It couldn't tell you which year had what. Still a good sorce of information on basic outboard repair."
4,Saved me a lot of time,"This is full of information and has saved me money on my motor (since I got the book). Lots of detail, the only thing it is missing is a troubleshooting section."
3,mediocre,"Although some of the procedures and pictures go into the details of the work, some of the basic things are missing. For instance, rebuilding the carburetor is described nicely, but does not mention a word about removing and reinstalling the carb back onto the motor."
4,Seloc Mercury Manual,I wouldn't say that it is as good as a Shop manual but it is pretty good for the do it your selfer.
5,Love these guys,"Ok, call me crazy, but am i the only one who thinks these guys sound like George Michael? especially on their other songs ""Heaven help me"" and ""Nothing ever changes"" love it."
4,Tintin in the Congo,"There is definitely some poor depictions of Africans in the book, but the mentality was different back then. In the Blue Lotus, Chinese/Japanese are depicted poorly, as with the Land of the Soviets. Taking the portrayals of potentially offensive material in stride, its an enjoyable read."
3,The turn-off,"Though long a Tintin fan, and having read almost every Tintin book there is, I found this Tintin to be a turn-off. For one thing the storyline and art is not as well-developed as Herge's later creations. However what disgusted me was the Colonial attitudes of Tintin, constantly paternalizing the Africans, and brutally murdering animals left and right. This is not the warm-hearted caring Tintin of later fame, but a young kid who sees himself as superior to the Africans around him and is made King. This episode can be seen as a flagrant advertisement for young Belgian kids to go and work in the colonies, where they can become like gods to the natives. Very similar to the modern day American media stories about the US soldiers in Iraq.Still, it is interesting because it gives us an idea of the Colonial thinking of the time. Herge himself regretted it later."
3,unpolished early work,Unpolished but forgivable considering it was a newspaper comic series. Story kept jumping from one point to another- all over the place. Also may not be suitable for animal lovers and those averse to racism
3,Interesting,"This book was great to have to complete our Tintin collection, however, the time period in which this was written leads to some interesting writing. Don't purchase this book for a child!!! It tends to be racist and there is big game hunting involved. I am glad to have it as part of my collection but my children will not be reading it."
2,Very Disappointed,Drawings are not detailed. Black & white. Paper quality is poor although cover is sturdy. Only plus is that it is in the English language.
3,This book lacks of good quality of graphics and art.,"I already had the spanish version of this adventure-story. That book was colorful and the graphics was great as we found in the other Tintin-books. But the english version is black-white, graphics is dumb and raw - page qualty of this book is below the standard.This book is not for the average Tintin lover - not for the children - only if you are a mad-fan of Tintin you can waste your money by buying it."
2,This should never be your first Tintin book.,"Deeply racist in the classic big-I imperialist sense, plus a terrible story; it belongs in the same category of ""early and deeply flawed effort"" as Tintin in the Land of the Bolsheviks. It is hard to swallow in our modern context. As an, er, 'unfortunate' adventure from the point of view of modern Tintin fans, it is yet, like the first Tintin book, a candid (and illuminating) insight into the popular mentality around the young author. Only slightly later, with the Blue Lotus, did Herge get Tintin's politics (somewhat) in line with modern sensibilities. Either way, all later works eclipse this. By a lot.If you are sufficiently into Tintin-stuff to get it in French *and* English, buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time.Get another Tintin book ! (I recommend Cigars of the Pharaoh)"
1,Don't Bother,"I read all the Tintin books; some I liked, some I found irritating. But Tintin in Congo is not worth reading. Forget the racist imagery; the plot is worse than childish. It's full of cliches about Africa; mean tribal warriors, man-eating crocodiles, curious elephants and apes. I expected Tarzan to show up!If you're not put off by the racism of the book, you should at least be put off by the hunting scenes. Tintin shoots, tortures, and blows up half the wildlife in Africa throughout the course of the book. There's absolutely no sense of adventure here."
1,Tintin Utterly Disgraced,"I was utterly appalled by the horrid depictions of africans in this book. It was extremely racist and I severely disliked it. After I noticed this I sent it back as soon as possible. If you are considering buying this DON'T DO IT. It is very racist and a horrid book. I normally enjoy Tintin books, but this was a disgrace. I HATED THIS BOOK WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."
1,The Adventures Of Tin Tin In The Congo,I am still waiting to receive this book despite the length of time that has elapsed since I order it. So at this stage i cannot see how you can ask me to review it.
1,beware -- this is the same album as perform.00,"I'm sure that true Howard Jones fans will have already purchased the import Perform.00 album. Well, this is the EXACT same album with a different title. While I like the album somewhat (see my review of Perform.00), I think it's misleading to release the same album with a different name."
4,Very Informative,"This book has good information about distribution of the Holy Eucharist by Extraordinary Ministers. But all of this information is also found in Pastoral Care of the Sick. It is a good addition to your library, but not needed if you already have the other."
3,For a Deacon,"Unfortunately it is from the old Catholic Rite for Mass, description led me to believe it was based on the new Rite of the Catholic Church.It is however a fine quality book, service from vender was terrific and I will continue to use him in the future."
2,Holy Communion and Worship of the Eucharist Outside Mass,"The book is out of date and does not conform to the current standards. Although the Communion Service is celebrated the same, the wording has not been updated."
3,What happened to the tapes?,"I enjoyed Spanish for Gringos Level 1 very much. The book and the cassette tapes were really great. I found level 2 in a local store and snatched it up.The book itself is more of the same, which is great.However, the tapes are really BAD in comparison. The original tapes were done by Bill Harvey himself.I can identify Bill's hand in the writing of the script for the tapes, but they are performed by some elevator music DJ. This guy does not capture Bill's ""life"" or sense of humor. He also does not pronounce the words as distinctly as Bill does on the first set of tapes. I'm very disappointed in this aspect of the set. I miss Bill on the tapes tremendously."
5,Sun Up on Lightfoot,"Sundown the album and the song propelled Gordon Lightfoot to the top of the charts. Both reached number one in the summer of 1974 and represented the peak of Mr. Lightfoot's chart success. On the album, Mr. Lightfoot kept true to his troubadour roots, with expressive and vivid lyrics, but spiced up his basic folk sound with a more mainstream rock sound. The title track is a perfect AM radio classic with its catchy guitar riff and sing along chorus. The rest of the album is strong as well. ""Carefree Highway"" was a second top ten hit and is a great road song while ""Circle Of Steel"", ""Somewhere U.S.A."", ""Seven Island Suite"" and ""The Watchman's Gone"" are all strong."
5,Excellent,"I had always heard a few of Gord's tunes on the radio and always enjoyed them. On a whim I went out and picked this cd up, since my wife and I began to listen to ""Gord's Gold"" on a pretty frequent basis. It was time to expand the collection a bit. The first time I heard this cd in it's entirity, I remember thinking how unbelievable it was, and still is. There is not one bad song on this cd. Among my favorites are ""Seven Island Suite"" and ""Circle of Steel"". Really, not one bad tune in the bunch. If you enjoy music in general, this is a good choice. Great sound, great performance. It doesn't get much better than that."
3,"Solid, not great.","The title track is naturally the ""big draw"" here, but arguably the strongest tunes are ""Seven Island Suite,"" and the dreamy ""Watchman's Gone,"" which features some of the best guitar work on the album. Interestingly, ""High and Dry"" is essentially played to the tune of ""Summertime Dream,"" with a lyrical swap.If you want one indespensable Lightfoot album, see ""Summertime Dream."" ""Sundown,"" like ""Don Quixote,"" is simply an essential compliment to the library of any serious Lightfoot fan. Avoid the disappointing, and ill-named ""Gord's Gold"" like the plague--it doesn't deliver what it promises."
5,The rating says it all!!!,"This album is simply the best Gordon Lightfoot has put out. The second half, which you can't sample, is his best. ""The Watchman's Gone,"" ""Sundown,"" and ""Carefree Highway"" are three of his best. ""Somewhere U.S.A."" is also classic Gordon. Buy this and you won't regret it."
5,cd,Excellent seller. I received my item very quickly. I would definitely buy from this person again.
4,"No great shakes, but Garbo glitters AND BENNETT IS THE BEST!!!","It echoes the Sonja Henie-films(Sun Valley Serenade made the same year), but Garbo is at her magnetic best - especially when she flirts and lures Melvyn Douglas away from the charms of Constance Bennett in the night-club scene.Miss Bennett steals every scene she is in - bless her - but though the plot is thin, it is(like the Sonja Henie`s)full of witty 1-liners... It REMAINS a must-c:-)))"
3,VISIONAIRE 25 - VISIOANRY,I suppose trying to follow no.24 is hard when you had Tom Ford of GUCCI being guest editor and it comming in a black shinny light box specially manufactured by GUCCI for Visionaire but that shouldn't have been a problem for the ever creative genius Stephen Gan whose the editor in chief of Visionaire. In it being the 25th anniversary I was expecting it to be a mouth open shock but instead was a shrug of the shoulders. It came in a cobolt blue album like packaging containg 25 sleeves featuring most of the top designers and photographers of the fashion world and a small selection of New Visions by new talent which where amongst the best if not the best in the album. Anyways its a must have for the Visionaire groupie like I but otherwise I suggest you start your collection with no.26 or get your hands on the hot GUCCI issue no.24 before it becomes priceless.
4,Universal Power Supply Goodness,"Contrary to the previous posters review, uncertain as to why they have gone through so many of them. Originally bought back in Summer of 07, this item is heavily used at a Laptop repair facility.Pro: Very convenient having the LED's tell you the voltage to easily determine the correct adapter. Snaps easily together, and tidy when stored.Cons: wish there were more tips for other brands, but very rarely have we come into a situation where a tip didnt work. the ""numbchuck"" cable is a little flimsy, but has held its own over the years."
2,not good for 19v output,"I got this for my son the end of June 07. His notebook requires 19v to run. The first tip lasted about a month before it literally fell apart. I thought no biggy, and ordered two more. Same results. They lasted about 30 days each.At this time I e-mailed Mfuel to report the problem and ask for a replacement. I was told that the tips carry no warranty, and no one else had complained of quality issues. After we went back and forth, they agreed to send me some replacement tips. I actually got 4 from them.They arrived the first week of November. By the 2nd week of January 08, they were all toast.It seems they just cannot handle the heat generated by the charger. The tips get hot and simply fall apart.I really like the charger, but this flaw has forced me to get something else.If you have less power requirements, it may work well. But if you plan on using it at 19v, for several hours at a time, I would avoid it."
4,If you want to run an All flesh (or any other post apoc. campaign) as something other than a one shot this is the book for you.,"A thorough look at long term survival,I've used this as a basis for both AFMBE zombie apocalypse and a GURPS TW2k setting.Highly recommended background material.Adi"
2,not like the video,in the video this unit shows it going from one area to another effortlessly when put together the truck base gets stuck at the point where the unit uses the payloader to load the marbles into the dump truck.
2,"Neat idea, but boring after a few plays","We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old and at first he loved it, as did our 4 year old, but both got bored with it the first day. Once we got it assembled, they had fun watching the trucks go around a few times, but then they wanted to rearrange the tracks. Unfortunately nothing works unless the track is in the predesigned order. It is now a year later, and they have never touched the toy again. :( It did seem well made and did do what it was supposed to, but just not worth it in my opinion since it is so limited in how you can play with it. You can't even interact with it. You just sit there and watch it do what it's supposed to do."
4,Tommy Loader is Fun,Our son had a Tommy Loader when he was 5 (he's now 37) and played with it for hours on end. We originally bought this one as a nostalgic surprise Christmas gift but my wife and I need to stop playing with it ourselves. This thing is really fun to watch.
1,Car Stopped Working After an HOUR!,"We ordered this Big loader from here, got it promptly. Our son was excited, got it set up, we watched it go about for a bit less than an hour and then the motor burnt out on the car. Now it is a worthless pile of plastic with nothing we can do about it. I wrote the company, we will see if they send a replacement."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this toy for my daughter for her birthday, she loves things like this. I have heard this was a good brand, and the video looked great. The thing the video doesn't tell you is that, putting it together is beyond frustrating as the pieces do not snap together well and as you are putting the next piece together, the previous falls apart. The track and trucks are VERY poorly made, very cheap plastic that if you aren't super careful will break easy. The track falls apart at the tiniest nudge. The vehicles at least once ever 3-4 times around fall off the track. My daughter is careful, but still it falls apart so easily. I don't see the toy lasting long. She giggled at it and enjoyed it to start, but keeps getting frustrated at it falling apart and falling off the track. Would not recommend. Really cute idea and concept, but they need to follow through on quality."
3,"Fun to watch, but very flimsy",This toy was purchased for my 3 year old. He enjoys watching it. There isn't much interaction with the toy except for a few track switches. It is very fragile and too difficult for a 3 year old to put together of fix when it falls apart.
2,Tomy Big Loader,I was looking for Thomas Big Loader and found out it they didn't make them anymore. My son had it when it was smaller and he played and played with it. Unfortunately some of the small balls where lost and a piece to the tower is missing. I was hoping this would be just as good for my grandson for his birthday. We put it together and it played with it them but the track would easily come apart and he grew frustrated with it. I don't think I have seen him play with it since.
5,LOVE THIS TOY,I love this toy. I bought it for my grandson this Christmas. I also bought the same toy 20 years ago for my son. My brother who is 38 also had this toy when he was a little boy. My grandson loves it and so do I.
5,Amazing and Engaging,"The Big Loader meets the descriminating parents' requirements of educational and entertaining. The motion and sequencing mesmerize even adults who watch it in operation. It is unequivocally certain that more dedicated design, systems engineering, and quality control efforts were expended in creation of this toy than Lockheed Martin Corporation Aerospace Division has even remotely put forth towards the F-22 and F-35 programs. The TOMY Big Loader provides a tenfold return on investment for every cent expended to acquire this for one's child."
1,"Cheap, do not buy, ratings for this are misleading.",This toy should not be purchased. It will never stay in place while kids play. Very low quality and disappointing.
3,how to combine multiple big loader sets?,"I have 3 big loader sets! Wondering how to combine multiple sets for a more interesting interaction. (At the moment I have just 2 motorized engines, but I'm shopping for the 3rd, and I have all the other parts for 3 complete sets.) If you have successfully combined kits, please write! Thanks."
5,excellent engineering in a toy,"this is a really great set for little ones that are into any sort of vehicles. my sons love trains and cars and buses, etc and really love to watch the loader at work. it's amazing how much thought was put into creating this toy...so simple yet not. highly recommended....i'm planning to buy more sets for the children of our other friends, knowing that they'll love it as much!"
4,For the construction site kiddo!,Easy to assemble. More suitable for kids 5+. The battery operated truck base moves pretty fast! Kids can interact by reversing the direction of the truck base (uses 1AA battery) as it moves around the track. Hours of fun!
3,True to life,"In my busy life (...), I often find it difficult to find books that cater for both my personal tastes and my reading level. Fortunately, Fransesca has come up with a rip-snorter of a read that I just couldn't put down.I would recommned this for anyone with a deep interest in slugs or just a passing fancy."
5,Fit,"Great to buy on line and item fits when recieved, did not see any increase in performance but wipe it off keep going, no more $16 every year"
3,why doesn't it say what the vitamin C crystals are made from?,I want to start by saying that I have not used this product nor purchased it. My problem with the product is it's lack of information. It does not say what the vitamin C crystals are made from. I want to know what kind of vitamin C I am buying. Is it ascorbic acid? Is it made from fruit? Just what is it made from? Even and advanced search on the internet (including the Nature's plan website)yields no results. Usually if I do an advanced search I can find out what the product is made from on their website or another website with the back label showing or a description. Bottom line: if the nutrition label on the product does not even say what the product is made from then it is not something I would buy. Please disclose what you make your vitamins from.
5,Really Good,I put a little in juice or almost any drink (not hot beverages)that I am having. It really helps to boost my immune system fast. In this form (micro-crystals) it can enter the bloodstream faster.I felt a cold coming on and I took some in the morning and in the evening and the next day I felt 100% again.
3,Great For Home / Not For Shipping,"I was very impressed with the fit and finish of this 50 Gallon Stanley Portable Tool Chest and felt confident that it could survive the rigors of actually packing items in it and shipping via UPS or Fed Ex. In my work i must send lab equipment to specific sites so that i can teach others how to work with those tools. Recently i shipped the chest, via UPS, with about 75 pounds of equipment and bubble wrap, from NH to NM. The locking mechanisms were essentially torn from the case but managed to stay on. On the return trip, having repaired the locking mechanisms, Fed Ex destroyed the wheels and cracked the side of the case. That's two trips and two disasters. I would highly recommend this case for home use and job site storage. However, if you plan to ship anything, this is not the case to buy.Follow Up: June 2011.... Just tried to use this as a shipping chest again with UPS and they also destroyed the wheels and managed to rip the top off the chest."
2,Way over priced,"Had I done my homework and wasn't in a hurry to find one I could have saved a whole bunch of money! Home depot has them, same ones for half the price. I like the box and it does the job, but the price was terrible."
5,The new equestrian tack trunk....,"Love this! I am using it at my barn as a tack trunk, and it is fabulous. The wheels and handle make it portable -- no lugging it about by lifting and carrying. It locks to keep my stuff where I put it, and the insert yellow top tray doubles as storage for smaller items (gloves, etc.) or as a grooming bucket.Only hitch -- the first one shipped to me arrived broken -- it had not been adequately wrapped and padded for shipping, and the outer box had been dropped and torn. I received a replacement VERY quickly though, so I am happy!"
3,Good Strong Box Not Made for Shipping,"I work for a company that uses this box only for shipping conference materials. The wheels usually don't make it back with the box, they break off when shipping (I only use Fedex, so I don't know if other companies treat their items more gently?) so I just keep re-buying new wheels for $5.00 each and they are easy to put on. The box itself holds up very well. I have shipped as much as 140lbs in this box, but don't recommend that. I haven't found anything that works better, so I keep using it and putting new wheels on. ( http://www.stanleytoolparts.com/ 037025H 50 Gallon Mobile Job Chest) Fedex will ship the box without the wheels, but it gets very heavy and hard to move. I like this box because it locks and has holes where the lid closes and I put zip ties there to keep the box safe during shipping. You could also put your own locks there. Home Depot is where I buy them :)"
5,great tack trunk,We bought this trunk to use as a tack trunk and for the price it's a winner. The wheels & handle and lock make for a perfect show trunk. Not shown is a plastic tote box that is a little small for brushes etc but still useful. This is a great alternative to other plastic show trunks and costs about $200 less.
5,Perfect BOB/Survival Gear Storage,"Extra deep and sturdy with a removable tray, two wheels and retractable handle. I use this to store all my lanterns, batteries, flashlights and firestarting equipment. plenty of room for camp stove and cooking accesories. 4 or 5 of these filled with your gear are a cinch to load and go or keep all your emergency gear stores. comes with lock but I don't want to fumble with small keys so I replaced them with Brinks pad locks. I have 5 of these and they stack perfectly."
5,Excellent Item Amazon WAY overpriced,"I bought this at the big orange hardware store for 86 dollars and it was worth every penny. I use it to store my camping gear. I fit a portable toilet, couple small canisters of propane, o2 tent fan, cooking items, and various other things in there. I plan on buying another for sleeping bags and the tents. They also double as our game/serving table with a couple 2x4's and some ply wood. Invest in it you won't regret. Wish Amazon would reduce the price to be competitive."
1,Too much money!!!!,"Wow! Amazon can not be serious. When I saved this to my wishlist it was listed for what the retail price really is $68. Where do they get the idea that the retail price is over $300? It's not! Not even the job boxes made of steel are $300. This is plastic. They are very strong and great for what I need, but no way will I pay 2x more. I was getting ready to order 8 of these to organize my life better, but when I did go back to order them they want more then $100. I bought my first one from Home Depot and I love it. I paid $68 for it and it is still $68. Amazon had it for $68 when I first saw it here, but what happened? No way will I pay more for this than the retail price of $68. I geuss I will be buying mine from Home Depot again even if I can only get 2 at a time since that is how many they keep in stock at any one time. Get it together Amazon so I can get them from you before I get all the ones I will ever need from elsewhere."
5,Good TacticalGear Box,Bought my two for about [...] each at Home Depot in Killeen Texas.I used them to ship my tactical gear and personal item to Iraq. They kept everything intact. Great storage for a soldier living in a Containerized Housing Unit.
1,Buy at Home Depot,"I just bought this at Home Depot for $68. They list it as the Stanley 37"" Storage. Same product # and all."
4,Amazon costs too much.,"Product is great, just like expected. Amazon hosed me on the price. I paid over $132, just to find out that the local Home Depot sells them for around $60.00. Amazon is not a good deal."
5,Great Storage Container,"I absolutely love these products they may cost a bit, but they make up for it many times over in the amount of stuff that you can put into one of these. I use them to store household stuff when I move or have to store my belongings for storage when I deploy or am gone for an extended period of time from my primary place that I am living at the moment. I love the wheels on these storage chests as it makes it so much easier to move things although when I pack them and lift them up I always try and use another person just so I don't kill my back in the process as you can pack a lot of heavy things or pack a lot of light things to make one heavy storage chest. I will definitely purchase more down the road when I have another move to make as well as recommend them to other friends and family members."
4,Good for portable tool storage,"I use this product at job sites to store my cordless tools and it does that fairly well. I like the tray from the smaller chest even more because this one just has a black tote. It works exactly as advertised, and is fairly sturdy. The only issue that bothers me a bit is, the handle doesn't pull out or retract smoothly even after I oiled the sides. But overall its still a really useful chest with many excellent features."
4,4 plus years of heavy camping and it is going strong!,"This is a great large storage case. It has survived over 60 week long camping trips in the past 4+ years with the Scouts. I carry 3 of these cases loaded with everything you need plus backup for 12 boys and it is great. It is very durable, easy to latch, the wheels are strong and have handled alot of abuse from adults and boys dropping the box from a foot or less fully loaded. We have each loaded with about 80-100lbs of gear in each. Because of the versatile added features of the box such as the slide out handle, lid supports, and strong latches, heavy duty wheel axles, and 2x4 slots on top we have been very pleased with this. I would be comfortable in recommending this box to anyone. This box will support you as a bench when it is latched. It is fairly water resistant to rain when it is latched correctly."
5,BEST MARINADE I EVER TASTED BUT CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE!,Does anyone know where I can purchase this Roasted Garlic & Balsamic 10-Minute Marinade. I can no longer find it in the grocery stores.
1,Buyer Beware!,"DO NOT use this company!!!!! I purchased an inverter from them which was very over-rated. It has taken me a total of thirteen emails to get to the point where I could send it back. I returned it after one test re-wrapped in the original plastic and in the box as if it had never been sold. The only way I knew they had received it was because of the return receipt I purchased. Now I am getting run in circles as far as getting my money back. After some research, I am finding out this company will delay you until your time runs out on being able to file an unauthorized purchase with the bank. I have also filed a complaint with the BBB."
1,Varg,I bought a 1000W Power inverter Charger Model PE-1000WC.The shipment arrived in ameture brown carton packaging. Chances are it was a return from someone else that was sent to me as new.I used it to back up a sump pump. It did not work. Never connected the pump to line power as it was supposed to and drained the battery. I was lucky that I caught it before my basement was flooded.Dealing with them is like pulling teeth. Phone calls go to voicemail and are never returned. e-mails were not answered until threatened with stop payment.I returned the item and am still waiting for a refund.NEVER DEAL WITH THIS DISHONEST RUDE COMPANY
1,Caution,Our Movado watch does not function correctly. The stem changes the time even when it is not pulled out. Considering how much this costs I expected better.
5,Wonderful,"Having lived in Louisiana most of my life, it is always rewarding to see a well written book on this time period. Christina Vella's scholarship is outstanding. The price of the book is worth it, just for for the notes and bibliography!"
4,A Nice Book About the World of Machines Around Us,"This little book (""Machines"" by Anne and Harlow Rockwell) describes the diverse world of machines from see-saws and bicycles to cars and blenders. Using watercolor style drawings and simple text it reminds parents, and teaches young children, that 'machines' come in a variety of forms and that some machines use gas to fuel them while others use food.Equipment shown includes: construction equipment, a simple lever, a child's wagon, pulleys and gears (block and tackle), a jackscrew, bicycle sprocket, car, sewing machine, old fashioned hand blender, bicycle, typewriter, clock, fan, skate, vacuum cleaner and more.Generally nice, the only drawbacks for very young children are that they will not have a clue as to what gears are. A good purchase however for those who are curious about the world around them."
3,"Reading the Body was interesting, but not as informative as I thought it would be","Reading the Body was interesting, but not as informative as I thought it would be, I did learn quite a few things to watch for that I would have never know had I not read this book."
1,Worst slicer EVER!,"This slicer is essentially ""tinsel trash"". Fell apart upon first use.Forget about buying one... they'd have to pay ME to haul it away.In general: EPIC FAIL"
3,Hard to remove,"My daughter wanted Quick Gems sooo badly for her 7th birthday. She was very happy to receive it, however, as a mother, I am disappointed in the removal of the gems. They are very hard to take out, usually a strand or two of hair comes with them. So, my review is basically, the girls love them, they go on easy, but are hard to take out."
1,Quick Gems - a de-tangler's dream,"This product tends to get tangled easily in hair and can be difficult to un-tangle. We spent a lot of time tryign to remove from my daughter's hair without pulling the hair out. Also, if your child has thin hair, the gems will not stay in and will slide right out. Overall, just not a very practical item."
1,Not worthy of Milwaukee,"I bought this to replace my 15-year-old Porter-Cable 1/4-sheet palm sander, which lacked a dust bag.What a letdown. I love my other Milwaukee tools (cordless and corded drills and Sawzall) but this tool is junk. It vibrates so badly that it skips across the surface of the wood. The clamp levers are so weak that one of them bent the first time I used it. And the pad is so flimsy that it was damaged in two places after a half hour of use. The P-C never suffered any such problems.I've been working wood for over 40 years and have never used such a bummer of a power tool. I think I'll stick with my P-C."
5,Simply A Great Sander,"I use palm sanders quite often at work for finishing. Compared to the Dewalt orbital palm sanders, the Milwaukee sander is a pleasure to use. It runs smoothly, has a stronger motor, and is well solidly constructed. I can feel quite a difference in vibration between the DeWalt and this one... after a half hour of using the Dewalt, I end up with tingly hands. This does not occur with the Milwaukee. Milwaukee's paper holding latches hold the paper securely, and never allows movement (again, can't say the same for the Dewalt). Top-notch unit all-around."
3,High standby power consumption,"It's hard to find information on the power consumption of many products, even though the cost of energy can sometimes add up to be more than the purchase price. Since parts of this unit are powered up all the time, I was concerned, and asked Cambridge. They didn't have a power measurment, but they did have the standby current draw number measured on a sample: 100 mA, which could mean as high as 12 W power draw. That's on the order of $12/year, depending on your electric rate. That's much higher than it needs to be just to run the clock--typical clock radios are 1 to 3 W. I ended up getting the Sony ICF-CD831 instead, which consumes around 1.5 W. Of course, the sound quality (and the price) are much lower so it isn't directly comparable."
2,It's going back,"I had high hopes for the 88CD based on reviews I had read. When we got it we discovered that (1) it's huge (and heavy), and (2) the FM reception is really inferior. Sitting in exactly the same location as an old Sony clock radio, it received only a fraction of FM stations that the earlier one did.CD sound is great; but as an FM radio it's an oversized disappointment."
5,Great Radio + Good companion to my mp3 player,"Cambridge radio is surprisingly quite good compared to its price. Make Bose radios look overpriced. To my untrained ears, both sounded the same. Instead of using the CD, I use it as a speaker for my mp3 player. Excellent sound quality. The fm antenna is in the electric wire, so try moving the wire to get better fm reception."
3,Funny but not the best of Wertmuller,"This film can be compared with Swept Away, but it is milder in terms of not having sexual assault scenes that are so offensive at times in Swept Away. I do suspect that Ms. Wertmuller is mysogenistic, since her general attitude towars women, in my opinion, is negative. Her male characters are almost always shown with sympathy, contrary to her female cast. I still cannot agree with her depicting rape and sexual assault as something funny and I wonder why so many people still laugh when they see crude scenes. This movie again shows that a women is just a female in heat. It is hard to believe that the same director made Seven Beauties, which is a real masterpiece of her."
1,WOW This is unfished junk! Has a bur on the handle!,A kid will think that this is cool but it's looks unfinished!Wood handle has a bur and is of poor workmanship. The item was low Q. and it cost almost what I paid to ship the thing.
2,Gift Basket,overall this was overpriced for what you got and 2 of them items were stale. I would not buy this again.
1,Paid full price but got an empty box of nothing,Product was bought to give as Christmas gift. How embarassing to watch recipient unwrap the present; then they opened the MST 3000 box only to find that each dvd case and find no dvds whatsoever. What a ripoff.
1,Please Tell Me This is a Joke,"Pick a sentence ... any sentence in the book ...Now read it aloud to your non architect friends. Then ask yourself if they are laughing WITH you or, more likely, laughing AT you. I honestly don't know how anyone takes this stuff seriously ... Unless that is, you happen to be in the AIA, and this is just the sort of crap you fall for every time. Before you buy, just ask yourself how much of a sucker you really are. Be Honest Now ..."
5,It rocks!,"In the days of boring cookie-cutter rap-rock, Cramer's debut album is music to my ears. Every track is unique and catchy in its own way, which makes it a pleasure to listen to over and over again!"
4,was not an excellent video,Played fairly well. I thought the video quality could have been better. Had I been able to get it on DVD I would have.
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","I bought this and Pia Nilsson's ""Every Shot Must Have a Purpose"" at the same time, and I found Pia's book to be much better from a standpoint of having practical information that you can start using on the practice tee and on the course. This book was more academic and less practical. However, I did think that many of the ideas he presented apply not just to golf but to life, and from that standpoint the book had value to me as an inspirational or self-help type book. On the other hand, I think his golf-related ideas could have been presented in a book of half as many pages."
3,So-So,This book has perfectly good ideas that are explained in needlessly long detail.The ideas are not miraculously enlightening and techniques for adopting them arequite minimal. Well written but not very useful.
5,Outstanding,It's a pleasure to see a sports psychology book written with such clarity and insight. This is top of the line scholarship.
3,Disappointing,"I did not read the whole book yet (maybe one quarter), because it is very disappointing.The BEST book on that subject is ""Every shot must have a purpose"", this book doesn't even come close. Don't buy."
5,THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR GAME,"This is one of the finest and most effective books I have ever read about golf. There are no""how to's"" that so many golf books are guilty of having. This is all about the game and how it all comes down to you against the course. Honestly, it has reinvigorated my love of the game and I am having fun again. I am re-reading it again.Highly recommended."
4,Very Satisfied,I was very pleased with the condition of the book. It was almost like new. The price was considerably less than what I would have had to pay for a new one in a book store. Thank you!
5,cost of living,"Even though this book is a tad outdated, it is still pertinent to today's lifestyles. Schwartz points out how we've commercialized everything from medical care to education to sports, and due to that, we've lost touch with ourselves and each other. The need to ""have"" and ""have more"" are discussed as well as the cost of this notion and its impact on society. We are continually in competition with each other in a variety of ways we aren't even aware of - until you read this book - and that creates fear and anxiety in everyone. Schwartz says we need to stop and take an account of our behaviors - but doesn't really tell us how to do so. Still a good book to make you ponder your own lifestyle."
5,Tips,"1) Price: Should be about $25. Amazon doesn't always stock this themselves, so be careful. Some other merchants try to charge upwards of $35 plus shipping on top of that. (Should say at top ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"".)2) Add lots of sweetened coconut directly to the pudding mix. Makes the filling go from pretty good to awesome.3) Cook & Serve - Be careful when opening the box. Last case I ordered actually had two boxes of no-cook randomly mixed in (weird right?).4) Availability - This is old school. I can't find it anywhere but online.5) Flavor - I'm big on coconut pies. They are my fave. I've only ever had two ""from scratch"" pies that beat this pudding with coconut mixed directly into it. My tastebuds give it 8 out of 10. Note: In runs a bit on the sweeter side of the spectrum.Enjoy / Good Luck."
2,at least at first if would lost a lot of its material,at least at first it would loss a lot of its material which I then find in my beard or on my lips or on my jacket.
5,lifesaver!,"My mom gave me one of these last year for Christmas & I'm hoping to get another one in my stocking this year! I had neck surgery last summer and the resulting arthritis & hardware are awful in the winter time. I took this with me to New York City last New Year's and it really helped me survive the 13 degree temps. I also wear it during the day in my home in Southern California, since I live near the water and it's cold and damp. I LOVE this product!!!!!!!"
3,Adults Beware,"I bought this neck warmer for my husband, who obviously is a grown man. The description of the product was black, one size fits all turtle fur neck warmer. When the item arrived it was a CHILDREN's one size fits all. The product itself was fine, but I returned it because there was no way my husband could wear it. The description does not mention that it is a children's size so beware!"
5,Warm!,Perfect thing to wear for early morning walks or runs. Great around the neck like a neck gator but also works as a wide headband to keep your ears warm.
1,Bait & Switch - won't do an exchange without more fees!!!!,"I was so excited about getting this GOLD eagle for my Dad for his birthday. The picture shown beside the item I purchased was GOLD. I received a SILVER eagle and the company would not exchange it for me without several fees. I am unhappy with our purchase, but do not want to pay MORE for a flagpole topper. I simply wanted to exchange it for the GOLD eagle they led me to believe I was purchasing. The 121.88 was already enough. Make sure you don't get tricked by the GOLD eagle they show you, it is NOT what you get.Viki"
1,A Slow Deterioration of a Great Reputation..,"Oh, Mrs. McCaffrey, stop it! You are beginning to really hurt your true fans. The latest offerings, most especially Nimisha's Ship, have got me wondering just what it is that makes me love your books so much. I will buy anything you publish, as in the past that has been rewarded, but now I'm getting leary. The possibilities for this book were bountiful, truly up to standard for a great writer, but the execution left much up to the imagination. This is not why Anne became a goddess to me. If you are new to the books, start with Pern and skip this one entirely."
2,"Neat story idea, lousy book","This book follows the trend of Nerilka's Story (a more recent Pern book) in that it is more of a writer's notebook than a completed novel. As usual, McCaffrey has designed a unique set of planetary and social systems and peopled them with potentially intriguing characters. Unlike her earlier works, this book reads like a rough draft. The pacing and time transitions are particularily rough in the first half, and several prominent characters become mere shadows by the second half (without resolution of their story lines). If you're a McCaffrey fan, read it for the ideas (and fill in the blanks yourself). If you haven't read McCaffrey before, don't start here; head for the Pern books."
1,I Swear this was written and performed for children,"I needed a few audiobooks to take on a long drive and took a chance on this one. Big mistake. It is written and read at the level of a 10 year old, and was an insult to my intelligence. The only reason I even listened to the whole thing was because my radio's attenna was broken! Don't bother with this unless your kids are into sci-fi!"
2,Boring!,"When I saw the new McAfferey book I had to have it, what a total waste of money. Absolutely nothing happened, no suspense, no romance, no sinister plots, no friendly mythical creatures, NOTHING! Please do not waste your money on this dud."
5,I loved this book,"This was my second McCaffrey book. And I must say I thuroughly enjoyed it. I found myself being at one with the characters. Though i would have liked to have read more after it ended, I found it enjoyable."
5,very good book title,"Hi,My nameis Nimisha. I hven't met anyone with my name elder than me so far. It seems to me that you have really advertised my name quite a deal. It definitely makes me feel good about being the first Nimisha in this world and seeing my name get the great fame it desereves!I would not miss this opportunity to thank you bringing my name to fame.I have only one problem. (Believe me.) You have priced this book very cheap. I think it should have been a little more expensive! Jushta kidding!Congratulations for the good work! Keep it up!!Ciao!Nimisha Mahuvakar"
2,NIMISHA'S SHIP SINKS,"I LOVE MacCaffrey, but this tale, had no suspense and darn little romance. The heroine faces absolutely no adversity that might build her character except her mother's frown. When she does manage to get lost in space, she finds a new planet, other shipwrecked people to keep her company, a Swiss Family Robinson type crashed freighter that supplies everything needed for comfort, aliens that are both friendly and cute, and her own true love. And even the course of true love runs so smooth that nothing really happens. YaaaaawwwwwnnnnnnnProves good conflict makes a good book and this one didn't have it."
1,Not Recommended,"I think Anne made a bet with someone to see if her name would be sufficient to get ""dreck"" published. That's what this book is--""dreck"". Let me tell you how I really feel, this book is awful. If you are an Anne McCaffrey fan, don't buy this book as you won't stay a fan after the experience."
2,A disappointing read!,"I am a big McCaffrey fan. I bought Nimisha's Ship thinking it would be a good, unthreatening read like Restoree. However, I was sorely disppointed. I did not feel anything towards her characters - they all appeared to be fairly undeveloped. What was amazing was the amount of sci-fi jargon I recognized from all the Star Trek series!For someone who enjoyed the Tower and the Hive series, Nimisha's ship was a disappointing read."
2,Nimisha's Ship,"Having read almost all her works, with varying degrees of enjoyment, I find this is a very standard book. This is certainly not one that I will read again - too predictable, without the surprises, twists and gentleness that are so appealing."
3,"""....................................""","Anne McCaffrey has done better. The book's heroine is perfect from the getgo, faces no challenges, and leads a perfect life(more or less). This work seems disjointed, leaving the possible culmination of a conflict with her sire's other child (Vestrin) in favor of a happily-ever-after-ending, literally on the opposite side of the galaxy. One must wonder if in the middle of writing it she decided to change the plot sructure, you can point to the spot where the two different elements diverge. I enjoyed it and have read it four times in the last six years, but it fails to compare to her other works. The only solace I find is in the possibility of another alien encounter in a sequel alluded to at the end with the mention of engine traces. Buy it, but don't count on it to enthral you."
3,interesting...,"I liked this book for the most part, it entertained me and provided good descriptions of fascinating worlds. However, I think that she could have toned down the sex just a little bit, the random love sessions without any love kind of did ruin the plot. The only real romance in the story, furthermore, could use to have been better developed. Also, that part towards the end where everyone keeps having babies was confusing and seemed sort of choppy and moved too fast without having smooth transitions -- several years passed in the story before the I was aware of it, and it took rereading a few paragraphs to figure out what was going on."
4,very pleasant,"I found this book to be a very light enjoyable read. Perhaps it is not the best of McCaffrey's work, but it is fun. The first time I read it, I was a little disapointed, but its turned out to be one of those rare books that I can enjoy reading, but be able to put down when I need to. Which makes it perfect for between classes, or during my lunch break.If you looking for some great epic adventure, NIMISHA'S SHIP isn't it. But if you are between reads and looking for something fun, I highly recommend this book."
1,"Upon recieving, destroyed","I ordered these a week into December as a gift. When they arrived, a week before christmas, they were destroyed all over my other purchases. Of two boxes of staples, the 1/2""'s were destroyed and the 1/4""'s were pristene. They were obviously shipped torn and then when I went to look at this page, they are now out of stock, and I will have to go to a physical hardware store to replace this gift... =( ...I would reccomend that if you are interested in staples you do the same! Staples were never ment to be shipped. (too fragile)"
1,Comfortable but poor quality,"Although the lounger is comfortable, within a month or so, the color(blue)completely faded. 14 months after my purchase, my knee went right through thefabric and made a 2 foot tear. The material had gotten thin and weak. I calledcustomer service. A supervisor called me back. Since the warranty is only forone year, I am out of luck and $200. I would expect a $200 chair to last formore than 14 months. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product andthe fact that Brookstone does not stand by its products, or care about thequality of their products, or care about the satisfaction of their customers.they are not the company I thought they were. Buyer beware!!!!!"
1,Thumbs down on Brookstone,Our experience with Brookstone products is consistent with our own. On two occasions we've bought defective or premature-failure Brookstone products they refuse to return or replace.
3,"Miss Congeniality Great, Cinderella Story Horrid","Miss Congeniality is a great movie for the entire family,but A Cinderalla Story is soooo bad dont buy the set. Buy Miss Congeniality"
4,a good book for the intermediate doll maker,"Elinor Peace Bailey is a wild and wonderful doll maker. Her book ""Mother Plays with Dolls"" I think is intended to bring out the creative doll maker in all of us. I have found some of the patterns Ms. Bailey does to be a bit tedious. However, once you get into the swing of things and realize that you really can't make a mistake you will have fun, and come to know that playing with dolls is such an important part of life! Enjoy the wonderful illustrations, and get busy doll making."
2,doll making books,I did not find this book to be inspirational in any way. Most illustrations are just pencil drawings... It was not a worthwhile purchase for me.
1,Not Happy,"I bought this staple gun from Home Depot for stapling targets out on the range. On the first outing I noticed that if I did not have the entire front of the gun resting on a surface the drawer would shoot out and spill staples everywhere. Ok, no big deal, I'll just have to remember to keep the thing flush right? No. About 20 staples later the drawer pops out no matter how I hold the gun, every time! I like the size, and ease of use, but durability is a big thumbs down. Every staple, the drawer pops out and drops all the staples."
2,Found weakest point,"I like the reverse hold over traditional staplers, easy one the hand. But with this one being all plastic the piece that holds the staple draw closed developed a crack along one side where the plastic pivots when you pinch it to release the draw. Now it pops open from the vibration of firing off a staple, the draw opens, and all the staples fall out."
3,It is what it is. LIGHT duty.,"I received a clear green stapler instead of the one pictured. Had I seen a picture of the one I got, I would've realized just how light duty it was going to be. It reminds me of kiddie craft tools. I'm sure it will come in handy for something, the size is small and it is easy to hold but I will look to get the upgrade to a metal one for the real mommy tool box. Next time I will rely on the description instead of relying on the picture. It is my own fault I assumed it was a small version of the ""real"" thing. As the old saying goes: Sometimes we only see what we want to see.. So only purchase this if you need a handheld desk type stapler that can open to shoot straight."
5,good value choice,very easy to use. compact size. good video. thought it was the best value based on the specs and reviews and we are not at all dissapointed with our choice. hard to go wrong with a sony.
3,Why would you buy this at full price?,I have had this for 6years and enjoyed it thoroughly but now I cannot buy the discs from the store like I used to which is why I am here. On Sony website I put the model number in and it said no accessories available!! So it is outdated....why would you spend almost 800$ on it?
2,Very disappointing purchase,"Yes, it works well within its (limited) parameters. But, what is the point of making recordings that you can't copy? This limitation was not mentioned by the salesman at Circuit City. When I went back and complained about this, they sold me $100 of software to allow downloads to my computer, for editing and copying, which did not work. The best I can do is copy discs to VCR tape. Also I have suffered the ""black screen of death"" others have mentioned."
4,Simple to Use,"I have never owned a camcorder before and since my child is now two, I wanted to have movies of him before he got much older. This DVD camcorder is really easy to use. I love the touch screen. If all you are wanting to do is make ""family movies"", I highly recommend the DCR-DVD92. Other reviewers complained about pixel quality, but I had no problem with the color vibrance or quality of the picture when I watched my dvd movies."
1,Read your manuels before you buy this camcorder,"Buy this camcorder only if you have the right dvd player or computer. The camcorder works fine, but you cannot connect to your computer. Lack of Usb and firewire ports."
3,FYI Up front on camera,My husband purchased this camera 2 days ago and I returned it tonight allready. After video taping our sons 6th B Day he tried to edit the dvd and copy it for every one to watch after multiple hours later he found out that the soft ware to edit cost $100.00 that's a rip after spending $549.00 for the camera to begin with so we took it back to Walmart. However the camera guy told me their sony 203 does come with the cabels and editing soft ware but he said it's still too soon to buy the dvd camcorders because they sill need to improve on them(ie) work out the bugs in his opinnion. Allso he said that sony customer SVC Sucks. I can vouch for that because we bought a monitor from them and it only lasted 2 years before it crapped out and it was a $600.00 one. Sony said oh well. beware....
2,"Great when works; sad story behind Sony's ""warranty""","I purchased this item in advance of my first European vacation. I read the materials in advance and anticipation of capturing the wonderful sites ahead. The handycam gave out after about 20 minutes of use: the screen went totally black on the right half without any explanation. Thankfully, I purchased the unit from a reputable source who exchanged the product without question within the first 30 days. I had contacted Sony, but their ""warranty policy"" is to either repair the unit or provide a repaired model to the customer. BAD IDEA"
3,No Break from Darkness,"This book is an opus, but I haven't actually finished reading it. The truth is, however, I'll probably still be reading it when I'm eighty years old. From a craft standpoint, this is an amazing novel. The detailed descriptions, the empathy the author creates for his characters, and the story are all very well done. It's a very serious book, though, with virtually no comic relief. I read it and stop when it's heaviness gets too much and put it down for a few years and then start again. At the rate I'm going, I'll be eighty when I'm finished and that's a long ways off. That's the reason for the three stars. It really could have been five."
2,couldn't get into it,I tried. I really did.... but it was a no go. It just went on and on and couldn't get into the characters for lack of dialogue
5,fascinating,though boring in the beginning. It slowly improves and will come one of the best books ever written.
2,Much too long and wordy,"I ended up skimming through this book, after slogging through the first 80 pages. There was far too much superfluous detail, and I felt a more skilled writer would have communicated the content of this book in a much more efficient and moving manner. I guess I also prefer clean Classical architecture to flowery Baroque. In addition, there was little forward momentum that I could detect, a by-product of the prolixity of the author."
3,Tolstoi Shmolstoi,"The previous stellar reviews are quite accurate - the book is beautifully written, ambitious, intellectually challenging, etc. The author does a stellar job of recreating Bahia at the turn of the century, and one comes away with a richer understanding of Brazilian history, messianic movements, class warfare, fanaticism, etc.And yet . . . it's a challenge to finish. For all the action, there's a curious lack of forward momentum. New characters - and their backstories - are introduced almost every chapter. Roughly a third of the way through the book we know the themes and it's just a matter of finishing the book to reach the ending that's hinted at on the back cover.Those who compare this work to Tolstoi's had it right in more ways than one. It is a truly brilliant work. And such a chore to read."
4,REFRESHING APPROACH TO SELF-HELP,"Based on the well-known fact that relaxed imaging, or daydreaming, activates the right hemisphere of the brain. This hemisphere is essential for healing, creativity, problem-solving and enjoying meaningful relationships. Dr Stone's book provides a series of exercises (action plans)on ""Calling for answers"" with your right brain and covers prosperity, health, justice, creativity, protection, intuition and more. I find his approach to self-help original and refreshing, and the book is really a pleasure to read. Also, the exercises are fairly easy to perform and memorize. There is even a reproduction of the mysterious ""Solomon's Seal"" that one would expect only to find in books on magick. Dr Stone has been a Silva Method lecturer for more than 2 decades and introduced the program to a number of countries. I like his writing style and his acumen for putting across metaphysical concepts in a manner that is easy to understand."
4,"IT Has Romance, War, Honor & Adventure","Since there isn't really a good description of this book on this listing, I have included the quick summary that basically describes of this book from the back cover. ""1776, and the smoking fires of revolution furst into flame. At the peril of their lives, Owen and Ella Sutherland forsake their great trading company and travel east. Here Oen is agian fated to become a soldier and will battle Tory and Redcoat...while the Sutherlands' son, with his young English bride, must also choose sides...even if it means turning against his own family. But the Sutherlands will triumph as they blaze new pathways for the freest nation on earth."""
3,Minor Relaxation,"I added this to regimen of sleep aids to help fall asleep during the day ( work nights ). While it didnt make me tired it did relax me, and relieve anxiety about. I found that two droppers full in a lil water right before bed did well. I wont be buying anymore though as it would be getting real expensive to continue to use this for minimal benefits."
3,work well,this product worked very well. the only problem i had with it is i had to use more and more of it to achieve the same effect.
2,Not much effect,"I bought this product since I'd heard about the crazy dreams it gives you.I dream almost every night and remember the dreams, which are usually pretty vivid and wild. So maybe it's just me but this product didn't really cause any changes.I gave it to others and they said they noticed an effect but it may be placebo. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,Seems to work,"I use this extract for Restless Legs. I am also on a prescription medication, but I believe the Poppy seed extract gives me extra support. This hasn't been the strongest extract that I have taken, but I was satifsfied with the results."
3,Kind of worked,"I didn't really help me have more lucid dreams. The first night I took It I had very vivid dreams. I was really excited to try it the next night, but was sadly disappointed when it didn't give me the same affect that night. I only took it right before I went to bed so Perhaps if I spaced out the doses throughout the day, it would have a stronger affect."
2,No significant signs of pain relief,Gave California Poppy to my 23 year old mare for a few weeks. She did not show significant pain relief. Dosage was prescribed by a homeopathic doctor.
5,I am using the oil to season a bamboo cutting board,"I was quite surprised when I read the reviews about ""vivid dreams"" related to this oil. The internet reviews insist that it is THE BEST oil to season a new bamboo cutting board so as not to transfer bacteria onto your foods. I was hoping to see how to specifically do THAT. Sweet dreams everybody! I have to go season my cutting board! I still feel I got the right product for the job!"
1,California Poppy Extract,"I ordered this because I saw a presentation on Dr. Oz. Overall, I would imagine it has some positive possibilities. My main concern is that since it is so easily accessible that our youth of today don't add it to their list of party favors and beverages. I think the ingredients should require adult supervision."
5,Prime Coffee Table and Bathroom Reading,"Philipp is best know for his wildly popular blog, ""Google Blogoscoped."" He covers anything and everything Google, and probably knows more about Google than Google themselves. Philipp's unending obsession with all things Google has led him to writing this book.I say it's a great coffee table or bathroom reading book, because each chapter (some very short) has a unique and interesting thing you can do with Google. And for most people, you will want to put the book down and go to your computer and try it after reading it. Some of those very interesting chapters include, ""Googlebombing,"" ""Googlepolls,"" ""Growing a Google Word"" and of course ""EgoGoogling.""This a great gift book for anyone that uses the Internet regularly."
1,Not a techi book,"Book is boring in some places, like ""Susan is"" book keeps going and going over hundreds names, also if I want to read about google, I,m not going to play the image game and the text game, to see how fats I can go. If u are looking for a technical book, this is not the right one."
1,Problem with the listing...,"There seems to be a problem - the image in this listing seems to be for another book, not the Festschrift on Mannerism ed. by Robinson...I tried buying it, and the seller fortunately noticed the discrepancy - she was selling the book in the image, not the festschrift. Still the same listing discrepancy after a month...can someone at AMAZON fix it please?"
5,One of the BEST worship albums I own!,"True God-centered worship. Amazing vocals. Great songs. Great production and audio quality.My wife and I listen to this cd over and over in the car. Love it! So helpful to help me keep my thoughts on God in the midst of the trials of life.Favorite tracks, even though they're all really really good:Center Of It AllGod Of JusticeTake The WorldOther worship music that I recommend:Matt RedmanSovereign GraceBrenton BrownIndelible GraceSojournOf all the worship albums I own and listen to, Holding Nothing Back is always in the top 2. That's how much i think of it!!"
2,Dissapointing last effort,"Just writing this cause I thought the other reviews here were unfair. I`ve been a TAD fan for years and rate the band as one of the top bands of all time alongside other grunge greats as Nirvana, Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. For me, TADs first three albums are without a doubt 5 star classics. But Infrared Riding Hood, their last LP, is a let down. It`s not a compromise or a sell out. It`s still angry and heavy. But it sounds forced. And the songs aren`t as good as on earlier LPs. Even still there are some decent songs/riffs like Ictus, Dementia and Emotional Cockroach. But it`s nowhere near the genius of early TAD albums. I guess it sounds to much like other mid-nineties alternative metal/crossover rock to stand out. Instead of Infrared Riding Hood,check out any other TAD album(or Tad Doyles new band Hog Molly, whose first LP is similar to Infrared..., only better)."
5,Oy!!!! Is there a better book???,"This truly remarkable writ on the alef bait is nothing short of a monument. Gorgeous and gloried...rendered by a genius, I am humbled and honoured to read and re-read it."
5,Letter of Illumination,"For beginners and advanced readers of Hebrew alike, this is an exceptional book for your collection."
2,Eh...,"I enjoy Rabbi Kushner's books, but Sefer Otiyot is frankly a bit of a disappointment. Not that there's nothing good about the book -- no; in fact, it is arty and would make a very nice gift book for someone. But if you really want to study the ""mystical meaning"" of Ketav Ashurit, then I would go with Rabbi Monk's book instead."
2,short and sweet,"The book was hand written which gave it an artistic appeal. However, I expected a little more detail. The book was cute though and I enjoyed reading it. It is a keeper nonetheless!"
4,Another practical reference from NOLO,"NOLO has once again delivered a practical and useful guide! This is a taller/wider book than usual (11""x8.5""), and with good reason - it includes a number of forms and instructions for the forms in the back of the book. Also included is a CD-ROM with digital copies of the form. With laws and regulations changing all the time, it is also a good idea to check online for the latest versions of the forms.The book, in typical NOLO fashion, covers the major things one has to consider when going about opening their own business, presented in a straight-forward, easy-to-read, and easy-to-follow manner.As you can expect, a single book cannot cover everything, and depending on what business one is thinking of opening, there might be industry-specific issues that one has to research on their own.Overall, this book is a practical and readable reference!"
4,Good Book To Keep Onhand,"I got this book because I was interested in starting my own business correctly. While maybe not completely suited to the business I had in mind it did get my mind working on the avenues in which I needed to traverse when working on my start-up. Good book to have, lots of information that could be helpful."
4,Great Resource For Entrepreneuers,"I used this book to start a company that I've been working on.I like that it is laid out in an intuitive way and it's great to reference when you're not sure about specifics in different topics (e.g. accounting, taxes, employees).It's definitely targeted at a general audience so it doesn't have a *ton* of detailed information for specific industries, but it most certainly gives you a springboard to jump from. For any information that wasn't detailed enough (especially when I needed more information for my specific industry) it at least gave me a few clues on what to search for on Google.All in all, this book definitely helped me to figure out all the ""stuff"" I needed to do, tips on how to run my business, and giving me some cool ideas!"
5,Recommended by small business coach....,"If you are thinking of starting your own business in California, especially if you have never done it before, you will find that this book is worth its weight in gold.This resource takes the complication out of starting a business, contacting the right agencies and doing things legally. It cuts through a lot of confusion, has an encouraging tone and presents what you need to know in a very logical and easy to understand format.I often recommend this book to my small business clients and find it to be a useful general reference. It also points to many other good resources and is a good value for such a comprehensive book."
5,Nolo Press does it again,"I have used Nolo Press as a trusted source for years and I will continue to in the future. The Small business Start-up kit is another example while I like Nolo Press. If you have flip flopping about starting a business because there are many questions you need answered then buy this book and will gain the knowledge on what it takes to get started with a business in California.The book provides the instruction in all areas, which includes the forms for getting started. The forms are in the book and on the included in the CD. The book assists you with your business plan. Your business plan will need to be solid in order to get a loan from a bank.The covers the taxes, the local government rules for running a business even when you are running the business online or out of your home. It covers bookkeepingm marketing, and doing contractsI highly recommend this book even if you are on the fence of starting a business or you are fearful of running our own busness."
1,"the worst, most pointless work in the history of the world","The total lack of interest generated by this book is inexcusable for such a ""celebrated"" author. This virtual wading pool of long, boring language was worthless and not worth the money i paid for it."
1,Violet is a terrible editor.,"As a writer that was included in this book I have to say I was heartbroken when I realized that an early and incomplete version of my story was included in this collection. Violet never checked or even read the file that was sent to her by my editor- instead sending it straight to her publishers to print. I hate the version that was included in this collection- so when Violet implored me to write a review of this book here at Amazon in hopes that it would help her get an IPPY, I declined.I hate this book. It represents my years of work in the sex industry in a trite fashion and makes me sad to know that I trusted someone with my story only to have it misrepresented in this collection.K. St. Germaine"
1,academic interest,"I found this interesting but only from an academic perspective. While the brain is supposed to be the biggest sex organ I found few of the stories did anything more than stimulate grey matter. Given the reviews and description of this work online, I expected hot and interesting. I sent it back because the copy I had was missing the last page of a story and like many of the other stories, I didn't care to know the end of anyway."
3,Not For Short Attention Spans,"Yes, it is very well written, but the target audiences are the history scholars and re-enactors.It reads more like a 100-level college history textbook.I was hoping (based on other reviews) for an engaging first-hand account of the drama, conspiracies, violence and social redemption of the French Revolution. However, the observer here is distanced emotionally and seems more like an impartial reporter. Three stars for scholarship, but don't wait for the movie version."
4,A Fascinating Read,"I have to admit, I came across this book by chance, and though I have scant knowledge of Cambodia, it's war and it's history, I thought I'd give it a read anyway.My lack of knowledge became very pronounced at first, as this is neither a historical text book, or a broader discussion on geo-politics. It is a very human book, with the focus on the people and personalities encountered by the author in his unique experience, from briefly before his capture, from within the prison camp in the jungle and within the beseiged French Embassy in Phnom Penh. His insights and observations are fascinating, and despite my lack of understanding of the situation I quickly became engrossed. The style was a little strange to me at first, and often quite florid (for lack of a better term), but that may be a translation/expression thing from the original French.Overall, a very good read, and an important one given the unique picture it presents of a country in conflict."
3,Not as compelling as I'd hoped it would be...,"I have read a number of books about the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia and I did not find this book nearly as compelling to read as others. For me, this book read like an intellectual recounting of events and not a book with any soul. This may be due to the translation or it may be that the author was a foreigner and so was somewhat detached from events. But it was interesting to read about Duch (Douch), who will probably be tried if the UN Tribunals ever happen.For a truly horrifying picture of the Khmer Rouge time in Cambodia, I recommend Loung Ung's ""First They Killed My Father"" for a child's perspective and Haing Ngor's ""A Cambodian Odyssey"" for an adult's perspective."
5,Compelling personal account,"If you're looking for a history book-this is not the one for you.I greatly enjoyed reading this book and it is nothing more than what it claims to be: a personal account of one man who survives incredible and tragic events.He offers a rich description of Cambodia, housed in an unique perspective. However, I never got bogged down in description that was too dense.It is a profound, but accessible read. I picked it up primarily for greedy glimpses of Angkor. Though that's not quite what I got, I was more than satisfied with the journey on which Bizot took me."
2,Read only if interested in a personal narrative,"There isn't much historical perspective present in the book. I wanted to learn more about the Khmer Rouge, but instead learned about the author's personal experience. The book reads much like a novel, and very few references to the history of Khmer Rouge are given."
4,Deliciously Simple,"I enjoy this cook book because the recipes are simple and very tastey. These recipes are not tempermental and can be easily modified if necessary (diet restrictions, preference). I like to give it as gifts."
4,an oldie but a goodie,"I own an earlier version of this cookbook and have been using it steadily for years. It is one of those cookbooks that you know you can always go to and find what you are looking for. The recipes are well-written, easy to follow and delicious. We recently bought a vacation home and because I rely on this cookbook, I purchased a copy for there as well. I was thrilled that it is still available in print!"
2,Not very good,I didn't find this book helpful for dermpath. If you need a book I would get Elston's book because it is much more reader friendly. I wish I hadn't spent the money to buy this because I never use it now.
3,411 JUST OK,"EARLY VIDEOS .WHAT IS ANOYING IS SHE TALKS THEN A VIDEO PLAYS,THEN MARY TALKS SOME MORE,BASICALLY SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.ENOUGH ALL READY.WE GET IT,YOU KEEP IT REAL,SING STUFF THAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH ETC.THEY SHOULD HAVE PLAYED ALL THE VIDEOS THEN HAVE MARY TALK.I LOVE ME SOME MARY BUT TRY SOME OTHER TAPE.GENEROUS WITH 3 STAR"
3,"Early Who, without the trimmings","I've always been fond of, but never totally in love with, the Who's first album. It features the band at their crudest, and it's lovely to luxuriate in the early power of the Moon/Entwistle/Townshend power trio. But Daltrey's in poor voice, the R&B covers are lame, and 'My Generation', 'The Kids Are Alright' and 'A Legal Matter' apart, there's precious few great songs here. As a whole the album lacks variety, dynamics and finesse; but as an expression of Mod angst it's fine, and you can hear all the seeds for punk rock sown here."
4,IN THE BEGINNING,"Fans of the group will want this first lp in their collection.PETE's writing skill will improve later on.This disc contains in an innocent way all the basics of the future,that will make THE WHO the greatest live rock band of their time.For now,PETE uses guitars that he bought in SWEEDEN(IKA),so that he can smashes them without having to fear that he won't have enough money to pay for his flat.Don't laugh while you listen to THE GOOD'S GONE and IT'S NOT TRUE ,even if it's funny to hear them.MY GENERATION and THE OX already shows the anarchic spirit of the group ;they also demonstrates that KEITH MOON was the most instinctive drummer in the history of rock."
4,Explosive debut,"Raw R&B covers and and a couple early Townshend masterpieces ('My Generation' and 'The Kids are Alright') highlight this album, but the big story here is the debut of Keith Moon. Just a Hendrix would later do for the electric guitar on his first album, Moon here redefines the role of drums in rock and roll, flailing to the fore and raising the stakes for everyone. Townshend's songwriting gave The Who their vision, but Moon gave them their sound, a contribution at least as large."
5,"The Who, a Rapid Surge of Adrenaline","I chose this CD as my 300th review for many reasons.My Generation, that one song itself is one of, if not the best example of The Whos highly charged loud, fast, rebellious music.Keith Moons drums pulsate and punctuate the lyrics and rhythm. When listening to My Generation, my pulse fluctuates to the beat, the adrenaline rush runs through my veins and summons my feet to dance.Keith Moon has been dead thirty years this September. The last big bam in rock. Keith Moon, a.k.a. Moon the Loon remains the epitome of rock bad boys. Leaving a generation in mourning, yet hasn't ceased influencing future drummers.Time has been good to this CD. It's still up there with the best of rock. A celebration of freedom, youth and their generation."
3,Still no remix,"You'd think that they could afford to pay someone to remix this album. Some tracks have been tweaked elsewhere (e.g. in the ""The Who--The Ultimate Collection""--compare that version of ""The Kids are All Right"" with the one here) but overall this album has the same limited range I remember so well from my old vinyl copy.The songs deserve better."
4,very good,"Excellent as always,although I prefer the live versions of a lot of their songs,the album is a lot of fun!"
3,Early Who,"Some fair tunes on this one, but the thing is that is the very first Who album now with extra tracks and b-sides and rarities. If you are a Who completist, go for it. Be aware that some of the tunes are a little tinty and not as polished as the hits the group was doing post-Tommy."
4,Early Stuff Worth Owning,"This disk showcases the Who as England's new pop stars. There is the mix of covers, including James Brown's ""Please Please Please"", which showcases a juvenile Daltry trying his best James imitation, as well as some classic Who. Singles include ""Legal Matter"", which is a brilliant showcase of Nicky Hopkin's piano against Pete's vocals and a catchy guitar lick, the masterpiece ""My Generation"", and the lovely Mod anthem ""The Kids are Alright"". ""The Ox"" is another John tune, an instrumental which also highlight's Nicky's keys. ""The Good's Gone"" and ""It's Not True"" are very much period pieces that have the feel and orchestration of the typical mid 60s English pop tune. Worth owning this piece of history, I just wished the recording was a bit clearer."
4,Aggressive debut suffers from poor sound quality,"Unfortunately this remains one of the few entries in the Who catalog which did not receive the digital remastering/bonus tracks treatment from MCA. This album is actually the U.S version of the UK ""My Generation"" album, which has slight track variations. Although the sound quality is less than spectacular compared with the other ""remastered"" releases, the songs are strong on the whole and hold up better than say, the ""A Quick One"" album. Standout tracks are ""The Kids Are Alright"" (which should have been a single), ""Out In The Street"" and ""My Generation""."
4,The start of something big...,"This is where it began. ""My Generation"" set the tone for their entire career. Pete may be regretting writing the line ""hope I die before I get old"" but the music will never die and never get old."
2,"Good info, bad images","Great info for the desert gardener, but if you want to know what the plants and cacti actually look like, the small black and white pictures just don't cut it. Gardening is a visual discipline, pictures do speak a thousand words."
3,not exactly what I was looking for,"This book is OK, its just not what I was looking for. It deals with growing native plants, and I was looking more for vegetable/flower/herb gardening tips. But it does have good information on native landscaping."
2,Rednecks vs the guvmint,"If you're a sci-fi fan looking for interesting ideas, skip this book. If you're looking for paranoid fantasies of a UFO crash, a not very plausible secret government cover-up, and the uprising of some hillbillies, this is for you."
2,Reasonable for food animals. Hopeless for horses.,"I bought the seventh edition of this book whilst a veterinary student, and it has gathered dust. Although there is a great deal of information in this book, which is easily accessed (an advantage over Smith's Large Animal Internal Medicine), it is too brief for serious research and too opinionated for a quick reference. This reviewer also finds the style difficult to read. If the diagnosis is unknown, this is an almost impossible book to refer to and the avoidance of differential lists contributes to this.For the equine veterinarian, I would recommend Reed and Bayly's 'Equine internal medicine', which is more thorough and better written. For the food animal veterinarian, this book is a possible choice, but it is my opinion that 'Smith', despite its flaws, is a better buy."
1,Of little use to the academic or practioner.,"If you know the diagnosis then good descriptions of the clinical signs and pathogenesis are usually available. However having ploughed through the verbose text, which is in remarkably bad type face, you are rewarded with a minimal treatment section which is extremely frustrating. Copiosly referenced the book is of little use alone requirring a good library and a serach engine to obtain up to date information."
1,i didn't receive the book,i didn't receive the book. please send me again the book. i was in hollyday and they send my book back
4,Very Nice Unit,"I bought this boombox because I had aquired the car reciever very cheap. I figured I might as well get the boombox to go with it.It comes with a VERY long antenna cord. It looks good and is very simple. It has an AUX in and a headphone out jack.When you place the stream jockey in this unit you don't have to move it from room to room. Just tune the satellite reciever to the desired channel then every radio in your home will have that satellite broadcast on the selected FM frequency.The only odd thing about it is the size of the ac adapter. It is about a third the size of the boombox. The first thing you will say when you get this is ""wow that looks cool. The second thing is... ""Holy cow look at the size of that Ac adapter!""Pros: Looks good. simple to use. Long antenna cord.Cons. the only thing odd is the size of the AC adapter. But I don't know if it is a con."
1,Do not buy this item,"This boombox is garbage. I have had 3 of them and all of them shut off constantly. The issue is with the connection between the receiver and the boombox, as soon as it heats up a little bit, the connection is lost. XACT, of course, will do nothing to acknowledge or rectify the problem."
1,You need Linux to use software,"Would give zero stars, but it is not possible. To use the book, you need specific version of Scheme language with specific library. These are available only for Linux or MacOS. Since I don't own Linux or Mac machine and don't plan to own one, I stopped reading the book on page 3 and never resumed. Unfortunately, I discovered this after 30 days return period. By the way, link to this software, listed in the book is wrong. There should be a big warning on the cover that software is available only for Linus and MacOS, to avoid situations like mine. Selling book with software that runs on 10% of computers, without visible warning should be considered a fraud. Oh, yes, you can google and find variuos ad-hoc procedures to run this on Windows, but none of these worked for me."
5,Beat Of The Earth - self-titled (Radioactive),"As far as I could tell, this title was initially released in 1968, and it was the band's sole effort. You get two lengthy tracks - ""Untitled"" (20:59) and ""Untitled"" (20:54). Within these two epics, you'll hear flute, swirling organ and Doors-ish heavy guitar. In all honesty, the late great Jim Morrison and crew would simply love the CD. It's safe to assume that these two long recordings took up an entire album side when it was first unearthed (no pun intended) on vinyl. Fans of Jefferson Airplane, (obviously), The Doors (duh!), Spirit, Iron Butterfly and Love should get plenty from this psych rarity. Essential."
5,Way cool and far out!,"The first reviewer is right-on about this! I thought it sounded like a somewhat denser version of the Doors on one of the long jams the Doors would put on each album (""When The Music's Over"", ""The End"", etc.)- sounds really spooky and otherworldy, like the Doors, only better! A must for the psyche fan..."
4,An Update on Music Appreciation,"A 2nd edition of this worthy text increases listening examples to four CD's and still includes an interactive CD-ROM and companion website. Congratulations to the author for configuring a text that could work in a ten week quarter calendar. The nine chapter format with introduction would be difficult to complete without careful choices-- but a tri-mester calendar would be a snap. The last third of the text considers evolution of American music to the 20th century, after following the traditional Euro-centric focus on art music. Other texts (like Willoughby) attempt to include more diversity from world music cultures, but require a longer term-- the semester calendar."
4,woman's movado watch,"Watch looks great, and was at a great price. My only concern is that the price is so low, and the name is miss-spelled (should be AMOROSA, not AMAROSA)that it might be a replica, and not the real thing."
4,Excellent textbook and resource for educators.,"This is an excellent textbook and resource for educators that disusses educational philosophies and teaching styles, classroom set ups, frameworks of elementary education, and notable contributors to learning and teachning styles. This textbook is a great reference for elementary teachers."
4,A wonderful experience!!!!,"This is a wonderful cd set (2 cd's included).In the first CD Stephen Cope talks about being a human being, emotions, purpose, and being a witness and how yoga integrates with these emotions. I have not listened to the whole CD, but most of it...it's is exceptional!!!! It is wonderful CD to have in your car to listen to again and again.The second CD is 3 meditations. All three of them are lovely, but my favorite is called Riding the Wave. You can do each one separately or together. I love Stephen Copes voice, but I kind of wish that they would have added music and/or nature sounds to the meditation tracks.This is a must have CD and Amazon has the best deal going at $16.97 for the 2-set CD (retail price is $24.95)Also, Stephen Cope has a wonderful Kripalu Yoga DVD/VHS that is very good. See my other reviews on Amazon."
3,"Not a lot new here, but worth hearing","I was a little let down by this CD. I am a fan of other things Stephen Cope has done and was expecting to be really excited by this. But there is nothing new here and it seems much more surface level than his other works (perhaps it is the spoken vs. written, but I find people like Pema Chodrun and Jack Kornfield very compelling on audio). This would make a nice introduction for someone who really has not spent much time on yoga/meditation, but is probably not for people who have read Cope's work."
1,Don't do it!,We bought this item in June. It worked fine on all our trips this summer. We put it away for a few months and pulled it out again for a December vacation. It was having a hard time reading the first disc we put in it. Then it just stopped working. I called Audiovox and was informed that the DVD player only has a 90 day warranty. To fix it will most likely cost as much as a new one and we have to pay all the shiping and handling costs. I wish that I had known that the warranty time was a short 90 days and that the life span of our DVD player was only six months. Buyer beware!
4,"So far so good, but....",it needs an operation manual!! It took a while to figure things out. I shouldn't have to do this. Someone isn't doing their job. I own all kinds of electronic stuff and Sony seems to have the best product manuals. AudioVox needs to get a clue in this department. The manual seems to have been put together at the last moment and just as an after thought. The player seems to work good..and has a great picture
3,A decent little film here...,"Somewhat old fashioned horror flick has a disfigured sociopath, who's been in an asylum nine years after killing his abusive mother, escaping while being transferred to another facility. This leads to a couple of murders and the kidnap of the youngest of two sisters who while moving cross country are unfortunate enough to pass his way. Watchable and well paced low-budgeter has its predictable moments, but is mostly a competently made and enjoyable time with okay acting by the unknown cast. Has one decent plot twist (regarding the killer's senses) and surprisingly very little violence, which in itself is refreshing these days. Producer/ writer/director Tharpe has made a decent little film here."
2,Good concept and story........but still lackin overall.,I realize this is a INDIE film so I won't totally abuse the product. Worth a look when the PRICE comes down. Absolutely no glitz here which hurts this film. Lacking any real action but the suspense is decent.What can I say when they offer it for 10-20 bucks take a look. Maybe Tyler Tharpe will be a famouse director one day. Potential is there with a bigger budget.
4,"Good, ""old fashioned"" horror fun","This reminded me of a lot of the classic ""girl gets caught in old house"" movies of the 70's and 80's. Done very well, it is definitely creepy and ""suspenseful"" as it says on the box, and maybe a bit slow in the middle, but it picks up for a good ""chop em' up"" finale."
3,Ups and Downs,This product has had a few ups and downs.Downs:If taken right before bed you will get a bad sleep and sometimes I feel like I've got flu like symptoms and the effect takes 24hrs before I will feel normal again.Ups:Definetly helps in the gym and the bedroom
2,No noticable results,"I'm female, but I haven't noticed any change while I've been taking this so I wouldn't recommend it for women even though they claim it can increase libido in both men and women. I've actually read a couple books also saying that it hasn't been tested in women and the claims are just from the suppliers who want to expand their markets, so I'd suggest going another route."
2,Not user-friendly,"I was hoping this compact guide would be more user-friendly.. larger text.. kind of a ""Basque for Dummies"". This language is no walk in the park. If you really want to learn it, I'd suggest a more expansive book or CD.In addition to being hard to navigate, the pages of my book weren't bound correctly.Wish there was a ""Language Map"" for Basque!"
4,ProFlex 4000 a good buy,"My wife has wrist problems and has tried several braces but this is by far the one she likes the best. Strong, with good support and a small strap that is less intrusive than some others. I recommend it."
4,Awesome camcorder!,"This camcorder is very easy to use, light, and takes good video as well as decent stills. My only complaint would be the disk length - the DVD still only holds 30 minutes of video. I have found some that hold 60, but only on the Web, not in stores."
5,Best videocam on the market for the novice.,"This videocam has excellent picture and sound quality. The basic instructions are easy to understand and implement, and because all you have to do is take the dvd out of the camera and put it into a dvd player ( including a playstation 2 ), it makes for ease of use. You really won't believe the quality. The camera itself is easy to hold in your hand and because it looks like a cd player, you won't have to worry about theft as much. The cost is very reasonable. The one thing i will say that you need to keep in mind is that while you can pick up the mini dvd at Wal-Mart and other stores, you may have trouble finding them in Europe. I found some in Paris at a Virgin Records store, but had trouble finding any in Berlin, and found only a few in Amsterdam."
2,Good Camera.... Until....,Had this little guy for almost 2 years....Then one day it just wouldn't turn on.Sony wants over 200 dollars just to look at it and the problem is probably a 10 cent resistor.Also the still photos are terrible. However the videos were good though though sometimes the sound of the spinning disk is recorded and can be heard on playback.I can't help but wonder if there are better cameras out there at a better price.
5,"This Great Camera is ahead of it's time, and overlooked.","2 years and many great movies later, I still love it. All the grandkids have their own special movies with slide shows and music to boot. I use Nero software along with the Picture Package. So what if the mini DVDs are only 30 minutes? That's a good place for a break, or another chapter. NO dull movies here! Now Grandma gets invited to all the kid's events so she can make a movie of it. This little camera doesn't look like the other camcorders, and has been discriminated against...what a shame. I think it is just ahead of it's time!Sony DCR-DVD7 DVD Handycam Camcorder w/10x Optical Zoom"
2,I dont get it,"If you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok.. but why buy this monster for that? I have a T1 that does the trick there and gives 5MP.Ok, so maybe video? ok, but then why do I want a dvd with nothing but raw footage? cant edit it without a lot of work. (where is the firewire port, or even the ability to edit an mpg file?) geeez..anyway.. I am taking mine back. it is totally useless to me as I already have a still shot camera.. save your money.. dont do it.."
2,toddler CD,"Had songs I wanted, but toddler CD's in general are not the best. Too much striving for novelty for parents and others who just want to hear the songs in a simple format."
4,"Good, solid Foetus","A typical Foetus album, containing all the elements we like to hear from him. The songs are solidly written, in an overall straightforward form, driving along with relentless Industrial rhythms. (He may not like to call himself Industrial, but we know he is.) Dark, paranoid, menacing lyrics. Lots of angry energy driving the songs. Good, professional production values, thanks to money from his brief association with Sony. A professional liner insert, with lyrics included. The Big Band from Hell is here on a couple songs. If you're a fan of Foetus, ""Gash"" won't disappoint. And yet, I must point out a glaring flaw. Thirlwell's singing voice is far in the background, overwhelmed by the intstrumentation. I can't understand how or why he let this happen."
3,"Not my favorite Foetus, but has some good tracks","""gregm_inca"" enthused so much about this album that I went back and gave it some more listens. But my conclusion is still the same as when I put this on the shelf a few years ago and let it start collecting dust: Mighty Whity, Verklemmt, and Slung are great, but the rest is kinda boring and not that noteworthy. Too much of the directionless slow and grindy stuff (""Friend or Foe,"" ""Mortgage,"" etc) and not very much life overall. The production is great, as is the musicianship, but that doesn't overcome the less-than-average compositions in my book. Especially when you compare this album to Flow, which I think is years ahead of Gash.That said, the three tracks I noted above are really quite good - Mighty Whity is a shredding punk tune, Verklemmt a kinda catchy pseudo-dance-hit, and Slung is a brilliant jazz assault. They're worth buying the album for."
5,Everything You Would Ever Want to Know About BCP,"Highly recommended for people in the BCP field and those contemplating entry into the field.This thin book provides the framework for a comprehensive business continuity plan. The author has taken the no-nonsense approach of using lists rather than blabbing a lot of text. As I read these lists, I said to myself ""of course ... that's the way it should be done"".One little nitpicking: some of the lists are obvious. E.g., the author did not need to list five pages (!!!) of expendable supplies. A few ellipses on some of the longer, more obvious tables would have done the trick.I used this book as a (secret) foundation for BCP work completed last spring. Now, with the phone ringing off the hook, it is more invaluable."
1,Boiler Plate Consultant Material,"Business continuity planning needs to be tailored to the organization and its needs. This book does not present a methodology which can be tailored as such. It, instead, provides boiler plate questionnaires and checklists which limit the user and the organization to the author's interpretation of what an organization needs. Basic stuff and not particularly useful."
3,he sounds better in portuguese!,"Alexandre Pires has a nice voice, and the songs are marvelous, but I must say that he sounds better when he sings in his mother tongue - Brazilian Portuguese. When he sings in Spanish, his voice is somewhat muffled and he cannot express himself dramatically enough.Therefore, I think it is better to buy the original version of this album, the one in Portuguese. It is entitled - E POR AMOR and you can buy it here at amazon.com."
1,Alexandre pires CD,"Didn't like it, a lot of scratches, didn't play well, frozen while play, never gonna buy a product from this person anymore."
3,Like it better,"I prefer this production over Pires' work with So Pra Contrariar. Highlights are ""Si tu me amaras"" and ""Usted se me llevo la vida"", in my opinion.To a previous poster: I think it doesn't make a lot of sense to rate the quality of a musician's performance or production according to his/her personal life. Your comments are well out of place."
1,MURDERER,"Come'n people u should not help this MURDERER make mo' money!! When he was drunk, he hit his Cherokee over a poor man and went away, WITOUT EVEN CHECK IF THE MAN WAS STILL ALIVE!!HE WAS NEVER PUNISHED FOR THIS CRIME, SO I GUESS WE SHOULD DO JOB JUSTICE...THANX"
3,Rough Patches,"I am extremely happy that there is a book that depicts the origination and rise of hip-hop however the sentence structure is quite rough to get through. The reader can flow through paragraphs of events for a couple of pages however, when meeting a new character, the author has a tendency to link various people and companies and sometimes events to that one character, within two sentences. Therefore, it takes the reader some time to figure out if the author is actually talking about the new character or the other items that were linked to the new character."
5,Vardis Fisher's best,"I read this book many years ago, and believe it will be my next, again. It is a book one dare not discard,as the second and third readings get better. Vardis Fisher captures the essence of the mountains,streams, and one can smell the camp fire and relate to the colorful fractured kings english. The movie With Redford was good but the book is better."
4,Fisher's novel is beautiful but relentlessly brutal,"Vardis Fisher wrote better novels than this but not very many. I can only echo the comments of others. From the first scenes, the author shows a country that is breath-takingly beautiful yet harsh and cruel. But Fisher is humane if honest. He is not racist, but his characters are. ""Sam Minard hated the Blackfeet. ... Most of the mountain men hated all Indians."" (page 14) ""The contempt, on both sides, had its beginning in the earliest association of redmen and white.... Each thought the other fantastically stupid, and his low opinion of the other's mind and values gave zest to slaughter and scalping."" (page 25) It might also be noted that Fisher, who was an atheist, has his characters speak frequently of ""the Almighty,"" but it would be a mistake to construe from this that Fisher was religious."
3,interesting but has flaws,"Quite interesting book, whose literary value I won't judge, but it has every rumor about Indians and every lie about Supermountainmen incorporated into it. I read it because of the movie, and the movie was better. If you ask me, Thorp's ""Crow Killer"" is more concise and more realistic. But if you are a West fan, guess you will want to read Fischer too."
3,"Remake of the ""Crow Killer""","This book is a redo of Thorp's ""CROW KILLER"" liver-eating Johnson. The name was changed to Sam but it was about Jeremy Johnson."
5,Places you on the shoulder of a legend,"Through the mind of the author and the eyes of the character, the reader is able to experience a lifestyle that man-kind will never see again. Many parts of this book will sidetrack many readers but the beauty of an unspoiled land with people who lived in harmony with their surroundings is the real reward in this book. Vardis, Sam Minard and America. It just doesn't get any better than that."
5,Better Than Jeremiah Johnson,"I was told that if I liked the movie Jeremiah Johnson that I would really like the book that inspired the movie. They were right. As much as I liked Jeremiah Johnson, the book, Mountain Man, was really captivating. Well worth the read and a good addition to the library."
5,Absolutely My Favorite Book,"You know the question, 'If you were stranded on a desert island and you could only have one book, what would it be?' My answer would be, 'Mountain Man' each and every time.I first found this book in high school, over 25 years ago. I have read it at least once a year ever since then. I bought the book recently for a friend of mine so that he could enjoy it as well.I grew up in Wyoming and I am familiar with the actual people, places and events that are romanticized in the book. Nevertheless, Fisher captures a time and a place and a feeling familiar to anyone who has lived in or visited the Rocky Mountain West.Sam's connection to the wilderness in which he lives and to God are something that informs the entire book. This connection is the prism through which Sam views the world, to include his Indian wife, his war with the Crow and his compassion for the Crazy Woman.I won't say more. No spoilers here! Lose yourself in a tale of the America that was."
5,A wonderful legacy,"We would not have this novel or its film adaptation, Jeremiah Johnson, if Fisher had not been put to work by the WPA Writers Project during the Great Depression when the country's unemployment rate was over 30%. This book is part of America's getting back to work and learning about itself."
4,Poetry and Beauty,This was the first book I had read by Vardis Fisher. He is a very colorful writer. His descriptions of every thing he sees and everything he thinks is wonderful. His knowledge of classical music is warming. I personally love classical music. Even though I enjoyed the book very much I did not like the continual repeat of his describing the scenry over and over.
4,Combo Flushmte wrench,"This wrench works very well for installing and removind the large hex/spanner nut on the flushmate chambers below the china tank.I have seen flush valve cartridges that were in so tight, the tips of this plastc wrench would break off if forced too hard. It is advertised to work on the flush valve cartridge as well as the bottom nut, and if the cartridge were not too tight it would work fine I am sure.All in all a good tool and a must have for that bottom nut!If only it were metal not plastic.Personally, I'd pay the added $$ for the metal version. Most folks would not I suppose."
3,"It Works, but the ST100500 Works Better","You use the narrow end to unscrew and tighten the cartridge. It works, but the ST100500 works better, it's easier to use."
1,bait and switch,"The pan which is shown in the picture is not the pans which were sent. There was no red spot in the middle of the pan. The handle was different. There are no rivets in the pan in the picture. There are rivets in the pans which were sent. Because the merchandise was not as promised, we will not order through Amazon again."
2,Not standard T-fal,"This was really light and thin , not like the set i purchased at Sears. It scratches easy."
1,No ThermoSpot,"I have happily used T-Fal for ages, but the item I was shipped did not match its picture OR description... no red thermospot."
2,Not as pictured,"The frying pan is okay but it is not as pictured. There is no red spot in the middle of the pan and the bottom is aluminum, not the easy to clean T-Fal. I probably would not have bought it if I had seen the picture of the actual frying pan."
5,"Ummm, yummy...","Wow, good tasting and creamy just like the 'real' thing.The pistachio and other flavors as cheesecake and banana cream and butterscotch are surprisingly satisfying while being sugar-free/fat-free. The chocolate flavors are good, too, but don't dissolve/set as well as this does. Very easy to prepare -- and ready to eat in minutes."
2,poor taste,Sugar free instant chocolate pudding/pie filling is priced low and but tastes just like unpleasant metallic which I never expected it to be. Was disappointed and will not order sugar-free again.
4,Funny!,"Good, light-hearted movie. Perfect for a relaxing evening. This one is much more humorous than the first, and generally better."
2,"Oh, no...","What a disappointment. Watching Matthau and Lemmon struggle so hard to make this clanker enjoyable was nothing less than depressing. Part of the enjoyment of the first Odd Couple was the clash of personalities between Felix's anal retentive, obsessive/compulsion and Oscar's boorish impatience. This film hardly touches upon that struggle and, instead, becomes a watered-down version of one of the Grumpy Old Men movies. In fact, this movie seems like a compilation of other Neil Simon movies. When Felix and Oscar get lost in the Californian desert, it's ""The Out of Towners"", except in reverse. When Oscar's son gets cold feet on his wedding day and camps out on the roof, it's like ""Plaza Suite.""Also the use of the F-word and of middle fingers just makes the movie seem all that much more desperate for laughs. Lastly, the Florida/California milieu is just inappropriate for these two neurotic but iconic New Yorkers."
4,Neil Simon + Lemmon + Matthau = Killer Comedy!,"Neil Simon is a brilliant screenwriter, and Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are the perfect team to bring it to life. In ""The Odd Couple II"" Oscar and Felix are reunited for a wedding after 17 years of silence. Unfortunately for them, everything goes wrong during their trip. While trying to get to their kids' wedding, they get arrested three times, attempt to hit on two younger women, and take a ride from an old man who dies a short way into the trip!I have read all the complaints of juvenile humor and inappropriate dialogue, but in my opinion, this is still a funny movie, and a beautiful tale of friendship between two clashing personalities. And, as a history piece, this is worth watching because it was Matthau's and Lemmon's last film together.If you liked the first ""Odd Couple"" movie and the TV series, you will enjoy this sequel."
5,Really funny movie,this movie is hilarous. jack lemmon and walter matthou are so funny together. the movie is great. the product is by far a 5 out of 5 movie.
3,The old couple,"Most ""number twos"" in movies are a lame echo of the original,and this picture is no exception. What is most noticeable in the two protagonists is the passage of time.Some scenes were still funny, but a sad melancholy pervades the film, which has very little to share whit the brilliance of the original odd couple. Not so bad as the ""Grumpy old men"" movies, but some of their sour flavour is felt there."
3,"Matthau-Lemmon is always a winner, but...","I have to agree with others that this was a bit disappointing. I wasn't expecting something as good as the first ""Odd Couple"" (really, how could ANYTHING top that?) but I think it could have been better.Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are both top-notch actors just on their own, and together they are an unstoppable duo. However, in the sunset years of their lives, they made four movies that I remember: ""Grumpy Old Men"", ""Grumpier Old Men"", ""Grumpiest (just kidding)"", ""Out To Sea"", and ""The Odd Couple II"". All funny movies, all excellently played by our guys, but all basically the same movie with slightly different situations. I blame the writers, though, not Walter and Jack.If you're a fan of Matthau-Lemmon movies, then you'll enjoy this one. Just don't expect anything new."
5,Wearthy follow up.,A Wearthy Follow Up Of The Original From 1968.Especially The Scenes In The Sheriff Office.
1,A huge disappointment,The original Odd Couple is one of my 10 favorite movies of all time so I was excited to see what Oscar and Felix were up to now. After viewing this tragedy I had to go back and watch the original again just to get the taste of the sequel out of my mind. There is far too much bathroom humor in this movie and it has none of the subtlety and wit of the first movie. This may be Lemmon and Matthau but it definitely is NOT Felix and Oscar.
3,Beautiful Creatures is better,"Since Bang Tango's first record, I have been hopeing for an equily good effort. Nothing has come close till I heard Beautiful Creatures CD's. Why the Beautiful Creatures effort takes back stage to the new sub-par Bang Tango I will never know."
4,Well Deserved Merit,"This book is wonderful for anyone who wants to know one of the most solid defenses agains e4 there is. Guides you through multiple examples and analogies. But on the other hand, I was really disappointed in the amount of games that were ""won"" by White. When i learn a defense I don't want to go over examples of losing moves and how so and so lost using this defense. But over all a great book and a solid system in that."
2,database dump,"Nothing here but a database dump of some high level recent games. Overpriced at that. From the Gufeld ""book a week"" club ..."
4,One of Bakshi's best,"Very good movie... anyone who's seen Bakshi films knows his ""different"" directing and story telling style, which this one holds true to just as Wizards, Heavy Traffic, and any other Bakshi film. The animation in this one, though, I thought was some of his best work ever... many people may site Lord of the Rings, or possibly Wizards or Fire and Ice... but this is rarely rotoscoped and always looks excellent. The character designs are varied and offensive, the motion is incredible. If you thought Bakshi was ""cheap"" with his animation, this will change your mind. It looks amazing. The combination live action and animation too works better here than most of his other peices, including the scenes that are all cartoon except for live backgrounds or cars. Excellent buy, though not for everyones liking in narrative style and humor. Oh, and its not racist, just in your face race conscious. This is the highlight of the anti-Disney's career."
5,Song of the South...Gone South,"A buddy of mine gave me a copy of this thing he'd found on laserdisc. He just said, ""Watch it."" I'd heard of Bakshi and had seen other flicks of his, but was wholly unprepared, yet fantastically impressed and successfully unnerved by Street Fight. It definitely parallels Disney's Song of the South in its storyline, but updates it through the paranoia between and among races during the time. Almost hypnotizing is the ""church"" scene with the pseudo-Sharpton. Very disturbing. This is a must see for anyone with an iron stomach who can laugh while taking it to the jaw. A disturbingly great night can be had by watching Song of the South, taking a long, deep, fortifying breath, and then watching Street Fight. Make sure the kids are not only out of the room, but out of the house. Walt Disney this is not."
2,a very angry movie,"a racial movie that quickly becomes obnoxious. The characters are annoying and constantly use the ""n"" word. There is almost no plot and no point.When one sees this movie they can't help feelng all the anger that is below the surface. Save your money and See something more intelligent and more positive."
4,Streetfight = Fantastic,"I thought this movie was amazing. Bakshi has created a masterpeice to be enjoyed by anyone who likes bizarre, twisted animation. A definate work of art."
2,The little flowers of St. Francis,Only two of the stories were interesting and they were short the others were long and Not interesting. No pictures! Disappointment
1,the Little Flowers of St. Francis,"I was most disappointed when I opened the ""book"" I purchased via Amazon and it was a Dictionary of spme sprt; nothing to do with the original book I thought I was purchasing. Very, very disappointed. ~R Moore"
5,Peter Weller Fans Hold onto your seats...,"First of all....anything with Peter Weller in it is a hit IMHO.Let loose on a world gone mad ""Screamers"" are the ultimate killing machines. All's fair in love and war - or is it? Seems the Screamers have ideas of their own....ideas that they weren't programmed with. Fast paced and rated ""G"" for Gore, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat right to the end."
2,small aspect ratio !?,"The biggest problem with this item, is small aspect screen ratio (4:3). It was a huge dissapoitment for me, because I have a 42 inch plasma TV. Aldough, movie itself is an exellent! A story was made by the same writer who wrote ""Total recall"" or ""Blade runner"". It's a big reccomandation for SF lovers !"
1,Get real...,"This movie could have been so much better - it seems to me like they had a good script-writer write the first half of the movie, then brought in the B team to finish it off. And you can tell where. The characters (read: caricatures) in the movie see a nuclear explosion from just over a hillside (~100ft away), are blown back by the blast, and yet wake up the next morning. Give me a break! While the special effects are neat, the story needs a whole lot of work. IMHO, this is one to avoid..."
4,We all scream...,"If you are a Philip K. Dick fan, you are going to love this movie. You wlll be willing to overlook the mediocre production values and the less than stellar acting. Asimov's robots are boons to mankind, programmed to ever be our trusted and capable companions. Dick's robots are self-replicating, calculating (pun intended)killers. Killers that are likely as not to turn on their creators. It is a wonderful story, full of the Dicksian irony that we have come to expect in his stories. The movie does not have the budget or special effects of ""Total Recall"" or ""Blade Runner,"" but it does have the purity of a P. K. Dick tale told well. Recommended."
3,Movie poorly matches the original story and is worse.,"I read the story the movie is based on when I was a kid, and I still remember it. It is a superb short story and very memorable.The movie was not as good or as memorable as the story.It's about an average movie only, and it changed some of the points of the original story to make it worse than the original story.If you have read the story, it is worth seeing the DVD just for the heck of it.If you haven't read the story, don't buy the DVD but go buy a book with the story in it and read the story instead!Chris"
2,"Interesting, but immensely flawed.","Screamers features a game cast, some tense action/suspense scenes, but suffers from some poor effects (some were just downright laughable), one plot twist too many, and an ending that seemed a little too cliched for me. That's too bad because there was quite a bit going for it. I liked Peter Weller's performance, as he delivered a very good take. Jennifer Rubin is decent, and her good looks make it easier on everybody. Sci-fi fans might enjoy, who knows."
4,the test of time,"The proof of the pudding is how it tastes the next day. This movie sneaks up on you--I recorded it in VHS, thought it was ok, next bought the video, and liked it better, and the DVD was great! Worth it just for the production quality (including blow-mind sound). The intro credits and title get shown to anyone who wants to see home theatre in action."
5,Wow.,"I loved this movie. partly because it had roy dupuis in it, but it was a really good movie besides that. If you like movies with gore,(or with Roy) you should really watch this. All it's really about are these little Screamer dudes, some take the shape of a young boy,(type 3) some take a robotic reptile looking thing (type 1) and some are wounded soldiers(type 2[good going genius you can count to three.] That last statement was based on a line from the movie.) The screamers are basically out for human blood and will stop at nothing to get it. Once again, I loved this movie. It's a good sci fi thriller and very fast paced."
2,Poor sci-fi thriller that could have been better,"Screamers is an interesting sci-fi thriller, and it does have a lot going for it for a while. There are some tense moments interspersed throughout the film, and it's a decent film for the first hour-and-a half. During that time span there's enough action, suspense, and relatively adequate acting and screenwriting to satiate undemanding fans of sci-fi and horror. Unfortunately, it all goes to hell in the finale. The last 20 minutes are so awful, filled with one unsurprising plot twist too many and featuring a badly directed and staged kung-fu catfight between two screamers that looks so campy you would swear you were watching a film that wasn't trying in the least bit to take itself seriously. The final scenes are also a misfire; it hints at the idea of a sequel."
5,Better than I thought it would be!,"I thoght it would be a typical sci-fi movie, I only bought it because it had Roy Dupuis in it who is my favorite!"
3,"Hell, Fire Skies!","This film isn't terribly bad but then again it isn't a new can of worms. The good thing about it is that it keeps the genre alive by creating new possibilities in sci-fi. Weiler is a sick and tired soldier (he looks more like an inept weakling) and there are creatures that are used in warfare called 'screamers' that are creating all sorts of hell on some far away planet that is engaged in constant battles. The atmosphere is a good one, the result of constant bombings, the planet is covered in hubris and ruins. But then again, where are all the troops? You can tell that they couldn't afford them so they make it a ""survival tale"". The ending is a ludicrous ""this isn't the end"" type of foreshadowing, but in all, watch it if you aren't forced to."
2,Screamers.,What was this all about.I purchased this film mainly because my favourite actor Roy Dupuis had a part in it.I wish I hadnt.Why he took this part is beyond me.It was a poor mans Mad Max.It was total garbage.The plot was ridiculous and laughable and to see Roy with his head off and wires and springs hanging out of his neck area was embarassing.Stick to what you do best Roy.Parts that are full of emotion and charactor.I have all the films Mr Dupuis has been in and they are excellent but this .......what can I say was total Rubbish.
1,"Wow, not very good","I watch Godzilla movies and enjoy them; and you can't get much worse cinematography and acting then that!But this was just plain bad without any giant dinosaur to redeem it. My suggestion is, don't waste your time or money."
1,a waste of my time and money,this movie is such a rip-off of every sci-fi/horror movies that have come before it that i just couldn't enjoy it! a waste of my time and money and i'll not waste any more time on this stinker or it's review!!!
4,"Great Idea Good stapler, not long lasting","This stapler is great for people, like me, who have wrist problems. It is ergonomically great, they work better than other hand staplers, but under constant, daily use they tend to only last for about 3-6 months, then they break. But if you only use one every once and a while or can afford to replace it twice a year there is nothing better/"
2,Must be Murphy's Law,"I have read all the wonderful ratings and put this on my wish list for a year before I got it. I finally had the opportunity to put it to the test and was terribly disappointed. The thing that made it the most exciting for me was the nail gun. I could use it in doll houses and on picture frames, but when I tried to use it...it worked for 4 nails..and then I had to take out the nails and replace them to get it to work..and then only 4 more nails worked. I couldn't get it to work after that at all. The staples never go all the way in, even though I put my whole 200lb weight over the top. It is after the 30 day refund period so I am stuck with a non-functioning unit..sigh... Must be a Murphy's Law in there somewhere."
1,Great Concept -- Poor Quality,"I used this staple gun to hang insulation in my garage this weekend. Prior to that, it had probably driven under 10 staples. Initially it was fine, but on the second or third string of staples, it started hesitating occasionally. I'd hit the lever and wait for 5-10 seconds for it to pop and drive the staple. It also started occasionally ejecting the staple tray braking the string of staples and dumping many of them out. The frequency of both problems picked up until the gun was exhibiting at least one of the two problems 1 in 5 times I tried to drive a staple. A bolt from the handle also fell out while I was using it. My project ended when my last string of staples was ejected dumping them behind a bunch of boxes.The bottom line here is that this product is a piece of junk. For driving one or two staples, it may be fine, but mine didn't make it through a full box. Don't waste your money."
2,Instructions not Included,"This may be a good staple gun, but since no instructions were included and I can't figure out how to open it to load staples, I may never know.I can't even find an online manual which almost all companies provide these days."
3,not real wild about this stapler,"My experience is that it is hard to ""aim"" the staples and that they don't go in far enough. The situation with the brads is even worse. I would try a different make and model next time around."
1,power shot you in the foot,"Mine says Balck and Decker on it and is a piece of crap. If you use in the vertical position, say stapling insulation to a stud wall, the staples fall out. I threw mine in the trash. Get a Makita rechargable power stapler."
1,Very Dangerous,"The idea behind this stapler is great, and if you have never used a traditional heavy-duty stapler, this product is for you. That being said, if you are used to a traditional heavy duty staple gun (non-forward action), then it can be very frustrating to overcome old habits of knowing which end the staple will come out. In my case, it was very dangerous and resulted in a trip to the emergency room.For years I have braced the back of the staple gun with my palm when using the tool on the edge of a piece of wood (because traditional staple guns have you compressing on the back of the tool). I was quite surprised when when on my second round with this tool, I instinctively used it like a traditional staple gun and shot a staple through my hand.I believe there are benefits to this tool; however, like all tools, it can be very dangerous when used improperly and I hope my accident can help prevent others from a similar fate."
1,I just wasted 24$,"I bought this 'cause I thought it was a good design and needed a staple gun. But it stinks stinks,"
5,Top Notch!,"I seldom write reviews on products but I feel I have to after reading some of the negative ones on here. First off, I purchased this before reading any reviews and hadn't used it yet after reading some reviews so I was somewhat worried about the performance. I shouldn't have been, This product is GREAT! I've used hand staplers in the past and this one just blows the old style out of the water.I'm not exactly sure why a majority of folks here have trouble because I've installed insulation,vapor barriers, carpet padding and even used the staples to attach backer board on those DIY bookcases and it hasn't misfired or jammed once! It fires deep into whatever I've used it on, in part, because you can get your weight behind it. The old stlye guns always kick back and are a pain in the wrist.Not sure why a lot of folks have a hard time with this product...it works GREAT!"
1,Aweful product- my fingers and hand are killing me!,"I bought this staplegun to attach wire to a wooden board. Easy enough, right? Wrong! It's near impossible to open to place the staples and then applying enough pressure to squeeze out a staple has made my hand cramp in a matter of minutes. Save your fingers (mine are currently purple trying to load the staples) and buy another staple gun!"
1,Great Idea... extremely poor quality,"I purchased this item, and used it successfully to drive about 20 or 30 nails, after which the stapler gun broke. When I press on the handle, I can feel the normal spring resistance, but it no longer ""releases"" that energy to drive a nail or staple into the work piece. I have checked thoroughly, and the unit is not dirty or jammed.This is the second arrow stapler gun that I have owned... the first one was a light duty version, and the second one that broke within the first 1/2 hr of use.I hope that Arrow tests their products and works in improving the quality of them."
1,absolutely worthless,Given one for my birthday and disappointed before the candles on the cake were blown out. The included directions are written for the United Nations... fine except for native English speakers. Very poorly illustrated yet replete with safety cautions/warnings of all hazards to probably include natural disasters & bank failures. I could not load the beast so I let my 13 year old grandson who's a whiz with things mechanical & such. I awaited his wizardry to be quickly shown up. He was defeated in 20 minutes although he persisted longer than I did trying to tame this useless now new shiny doorstop.
2,No longer in production.......thank goodness!,"No longer an ""Arrow"" product and no longer in production after a brief run as ""Power Shot Pro"". Will only accept 9/16"" X 14MM 'brad nails'. Will drive one brad every 2 or 3 times, then brad nails jam up sideways. The only staples it will accept are very narrow puny, light duty 1/4"" to 9/16"" (long)staples..This has to be one of the 10 worst tools in my 60+ years of using various tools. I'd sell it for $2.00 if I could. Have had it too long to return, just started trying to use it. I now have 4 staplers requiring 3 types of staples, two of which (available staples) are discontinued..Sadly, this stapler is a domestic (made in USA) product that could only be improved by production in China.....and then only MAYBE. Save your money, folks!"
1,Terrible Terrible Product,"Got this stapler as gift, straight out of the box it didn't work. Never got around to returning it, so one day I messed with it for a while and got it to shoot 2 or 3 staples, thought all was good and put it on the shelf. Went to use it yesterday and managed to shoot 4 staples before it broke again, opening the cartridge reveals that it keeps splitting up the staples causing them to misfire and even sometimes jam. I gave up after reloading it about 5 times and only successfully shooting 6-8 out of 40-50 attempts.The only place this thing belongs is in the garbage!!"
3,Good product,"I bought a Powershot Pro 8000k, used it, and had no problems. It does take some getting used to because of the configuration of the handle (the trigger mechanism), but it worked correctly and puts the staples where I aimed. It also shoots a very small (9/16 inch) brad, which I used to install baseboard without problems."
1,JUNK!,I bought the Powershot Pro 8000 locally without reading reviews here first. BIG MISTAKE! Struggled to get each staple to fire and after less than 50 total staples it has quit firing altogether. A quick look at other review sites reveals this to be a very common problemZERO stars.

2,Small and flavor is mediocer,"The item was only 8 ribbons about 4 inches long. Beautiful multicolerd ribbons but the flavor was not what I expected. The flavor was a creamy vanilla with a slight hint of mint, it reminded me of a flavor of a liguid antacid."
2,terrible.. or is it all terrible?,"maybe I liked ribbon candy more as a child than an adult, maybe this stuff just sucks. either way, it sucks."
3,Ribbon Candy,"Beautiful and delicious, but many of the pieces were broken. This may be due to heavy shipments this time of year and number of boxes that were loaded on top of the box."
2,"looks good, tastes meh","They had this for $2.29 at CVS (which used to be SavOns). It seemed like a Christmasy thing so I bought it. There are six big pieces inside. One of them was broken in half, but I didn't mind. The candy looks pretty and it tastes so-so. It's not one of my favorite kinds of candy, but I bought it to celebrate Christmas. I think I haven't had ribbon candy in many years. I don't remember seeing it around until today at CVS. I think they should use better tasting flavors in this candy. They're really not very good flavors. A couple of pieces were licorice, which I don't like, and one piece was spearmint, which I really hate. I hate anything that is spearmint flavored. There are many much better flavors that they could have used. They really should improve their product."
1,Broken broken broken,"All except one piece were broken. I purchased them to show my children what our Christmas candy was when I was young. If not for the fact that I did not want to ""take candy from a baby"" it would have been returned. Very disappointed."
1,Not the ribbon candy I remember as a kid!,"This is NOT the yummy HARD ribbon candy I remember as a kid. The picture on the box is VERY MISLEADING. Nothing on the outside is what's on the inside! The box cover showed pink, my old time favorite. Inside the box there were 6 pieces - orange, yellow, 2 greens (one with white on the edges), red (with a white stripe on the edges) and white with green on the edges. It was dull, NOT shiny and then softened up fast in your mouth. VERY Disappointing!! If you are looking for the stuff we ate during the holidays in the 60's and 70's, DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
2,Candy broken,The Candy tastes exactly as I remember. Unfortunately all pieces were crushed into tiny little peices. I would buy in the store but would not recommend having this shipped to your house.
2,Way off mark!,"If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era. I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps. This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get. The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing. Sorry, no my thing. They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly. Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive."
5,These work great!,Buy these if you are tired of driving to the hardware store and paying for a new tube of caulk or glue to use only 1/4 of it. They will save you the trip. They do many other things also which is very handy.
5,Very good book,The book is brand new in its sense. At a much lower lower price! good for students. Thanks amazon.
5,Problem..but quickly resolved !!,"There was a minor problem with my order, but the seller promptly contacted me and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I'm completely satisfied and will do business with this seller again."
4,"COLLEGE ALGEBRA, 7TH EDITION, BY KAUFMANN & SCHWITTERS","THIS PRODUCT IS LIKE NEW, BUT IT SHOULD BE ON SALE THE WAY IT IS ON THE PICTURE AS FOR STUDENT EDITION AND NOT FOR INSTRUCTOR."
5,Outstanding!,"I received this toe ring last week from Gem Avenue, and it's great looking, and really comfortable to wear. I haven't taken it off."
5,Bright Lights,This is a awesome Light Kit. Everything you need for a quick insluation. Instruction were very easy to follow. These lights throw out a serious light beam.
3,Clunky,"The adapter does what it's supposed to do, but is unwieldy and protrudes almost 2 inches from the side of the laptop."
4,"not so sure about durability of this card, or my notebook's port","I used this to attach my wifi usb adapter to my notebook after the notebook's usb ports started intermittently shutting down during heavy downloading..I am not sure if this card failed, after a few sessions of heavy downloading, or if it was my notebook express slot that failed...at anyrate my notebook is still working okay except for the usb problem but I don't have any other express adapters to test my notebook's express card slot...I recommend that you read more reviews about this product and this brand before committing.I changed this review since I now found out that it requires a separate power adapter to function properly which it now does, perfectly. It seems that the notebook's port power alone was not sufficient to power the card for some purposes such as for high data bandwidth extended time transfers."
3,Story good; Writing weak at best,"The story itself is an interesting one, and Herbert sets it up well. But her writing is weak and clunky. She's all about telling, not showing, and randomly jumps to other POVs (of minor characters) for a single paragraph to show they believe/disbelieve in Valorian, rather than letting their actions show it.Frankly the fact that the hero is named Valorian and the evildoer Tyrannis should be enough to clue you in that Herbert's writing is anything but subtle."
4,I said yes! =P,"My fiance surprised me on my birthday with a marriage proposal, he asked me at night on the beach so I could not see the ring, but the diamonds sparkle so much I actually saw the sparkling in the moonlight! This ring is gorgeous, it shines and sparkles so nicely the photos on here don't do this ring real justice. This ring also came appraised at over double what it costs here, it's truely a great deal at this price. The center stone on mine actually is .5 ct not .45 ct like the description says here. The only downside to ordering from here, and why I rated 4 stars rather than 5 is that my fiance said the ring took a very long time to deliver (it was delayed beyond their original estimate)."
5,WOW,"I must say that I am some what partial because it is my engagement ring, but it is gorgous! When my fiance got down on one knee, the tears started flowing, I was so suprised. Through the tears all I could see was sparkles, I knew it had to be beautiful! Although the description says that the clarity and color are atleast h, sI2, my ring was certified colorless, and apprasied at 3 times the price that he purchased it for! The quality of the ring is wonderful as well, the setting is thick and sturdy, not cheap and hollowed out like most rings you see at the jewlery counter!"
4,for those who don't scare easy,"I heard a lot about this book but only recently obtained a copy as it is out of print. I read it at night in bed with a little book light and every time the house creaked my heart jumped. it doesn't rely on monsters and blood and guts, but pure psychological terror. You'll keep asking yourself, what was that noise? did I just see someone outside my window? why is the cat avoiding the bedroom closet? The ending was not bad, no big overture or anything, more realistic than other novels. My one complaint was that toward the end of the book the author started to write from the ghosts point of view and that annoyed me. It was more fun wondering if the characters were going insane. But I still would recommend it to anyone who likes horror and can't stand the type of thing King and Koontz write about."
4,More than just a ghost story,"I really enjoyed reading this book! It is a creepy ghost story and so much more. It is a ghost story with supense, mystery and even some romance. The characters were well developed, both live and those from the spirit world. For me, the most intriguing part of reading this book was the way the author melded traditional Christian ideas along with spiritualist ones and even some Eastern influences. Great book! I look forward to reading more from this author."
2,Forgettable,"This book did not do it for me. It was not really a ghost story and so forgettable that two days after I read it, I couldn't remember anything about it."
2,Predictable and predictabler,"I thought I'd enjoy this book but as the title says it was completely predictable on every level. Any thrills or shocks are spelled out well before they occur. I really struggled through this book and only kept reading after looking again at these reviews some of which said there was a twist at the end. Even this was predictable and I saw it coming about half way through.On top of this is the woodenness of the characters, not to mention their apparent stupidity. They go through a huge amount of ghostly situations and still never seem to know what's going on - They continuously accept that ghostly goings on are happening and then several sentences later they behave as if they have no idea.Save yourself some time: read the first few chapters, skip to the middle, and then skip to the end."
3,"Starts out spooky, but the ending was a bit anti-climatic","This book started out great and really gave me the chills. The very first chapter got me scared enough that I was riveted to each and every single page. The characters are fairly well drawn out, but sadly, the end of the book doesn't live up to the chills in the beginning of the book. I liked the little twist at the very end, but the rest of the book couldn't hold a candle to those first eerie pages."
2,A bit disappointing,I was looking forward to reading a really good ghost story. There are so few around. But I also enjoy murder/mystery and that is what I got out of this book. It started out as a ghost story and soon turned into a who-dun-it. Very predictable and drawn out.
4,Chilling!,"A friend recommended this book and I finally found it in a used book store. This book should definately be brought back into print! Not to compare the two authors, but not since reading M.R. James's ghost stories have I ever felt so chilled. This book stayed in my mind for a long time after finishing it!"
2,"great plot, terrible writing","Okay, maybe terrible is a little too harsh. But the editor in me couldn't put down my proverbial pen. So many problems, small things, using the conjunctions ""but, yet, though"" inappropriately, and the predictability, poor dialogue- seriously, cops, even fictionalized ones, just don't talk like that. It was stilting.When he writes the horror, writes the ghosts, he shines. It seems writing the straight stuff is difficult for him, and it makes for difficult reading."
5,a great ghost story,"I found a recommendation on Amazon.co.UK , never heard of the author before this am now reading a second book by him as this book was one of the best ghost stories I have ever read!! It warns you not to read alone at night and of course I did!! Haha was to scared to go pee in the night! What a pity that good ghost stories are few and far between. Don't drink before u take this book with you to bed..u have been warned :-)"
1,"Fun for the kids, NOT","Truthfully, I am sad to say I have one of these. This keyboard which I purchased long ago was actually to be used with IPAQ or maybe other old windows PDA, as I recall. Seemed like a good idea at the time, but I don't think it ever worked well even for that product. Maybe it did, I can't recall. I was researching if this was actually blue tooth, and had a chance to be used with today's products and found the comments here. I don't think so!Mine is now a conversation piece and visitor keyboard at my desk. LOL. I figure it will be soothing for visitors to be able to type on it and say what's that! I wonder if they've had these 14 left since 2002???That is all."
4,Requires Companion Book,Interesting for genealogy but requires a companion book to be useful. Maps are basic outlines of borders of various subdivisions of Ireland.
3,Not for the V3i,"I have a V3i which is very similar to the V3 & the V3c except for one little detail on the front. The motorola emblem on the front of the V3i is in a different spot than the V3 & V3c so the cut out for the ""M"" does not match up with the ""M"" on my phone. It is a minor detail, but it makes it very obvious that it's a case. Overall the case is fine aside from that one little detail....it serves it's purpose."
4,phone cover,I like the color and it fits the phone very well. I was a bit disappointed that it does not have the button on the back to attach it to the clip-on phone hook.
3,Lavender??,"The color is more pink than lavender. You're lucky if you don't break the clips on the front cover trying to get the thing on the first time. The good thing is once it's on it's basically on for good, it is a snug fit and recovers well from dropping. Better to scratch the case than the phone. The downside is that it increases both the weight and thickness of the phone by approx 50% and the life expectancy isn't that great. I had the blue case and when it broke I bought the lavender one (neither lasted 6 months)."
2,WORKED FOR 2 DAYS,"WHEN I RECEIVED MY STAPLER I LIKED THE WAY I FELT IN MY HAND AND THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK JUST FINE. UNTIL MY CREW AND I WERE USING THIS STAPLER WITHOUT TROUBLE UNTIL THE SPRING RETAINER FLEW OUT OF THE BACK OF THE GUN. AND WAS NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. THE PROBLEM WITH THE STAPLER IS THAT IT HAS NO SECONDARY LATCH, JUST A SLOT AND THE VIBRATION FROM USE MUST HAVE KNOCKED IT OUT. THE USER DID NOT KNOW THIS UNTIL THE PART WAS FLYING OFF OF A TWO STORY HOUSE. THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL EVEN IF WE DID FIND IT, AND LOOKING FOR IT COST ME MORE THAN THE TOOL!!!"
4,Good for home use,"I have run several boxes of staples through this stapler and it has worked flawlessly. It will hold two strips of staples on each load. I have not had a jam or fly appart failure like some of the other reviewers have, but I found it difficult to disassemble, losing it one star. (I always take everything appart when I get it.) Disassembly is the only way to clear serious jams. It comes with a nylon wrist strap and the handle is comfortable to grip. I would buy another one if this one gets lost."
3,"Easy To Read, But Not Many Big Ideas","I completed this book in 3 hours, one to two sittings.You can imagine how easy to read this book can be.This book is a good synthesis of useful ideas pertinent to customer relationship marketing, especially for those laymen in this area.But not for me though!Try"" Experiental Marketing""and ""Experience Economy"", if you want a more in-depth, powerful look at the true meaning of Emotion Marketing."
3,"Enjoy the crime fighters and the noir treatment, but enjoy the background scenes too","""Appointment with Danger,"" released in 1951, showcased a small group of federal law enforcement officers, Postal Inspectors. Alan Ladd starred, but fans of police dramas will enjoy seeing Jack Webb and Harry Morgan performing together, prefiguring their partnership on the TV series ""Dragnet,"" but with an unexpected role reversal. In this film noir, the two are the criminals.As the U.S. Postal Service faces bankruptcy, the introductory scenes that show the U.S. Postal Service of 1950 are absorbing. Because nabbing the bad guys depends on the testimony of a nun, there are scenes of churches and convents that open a window of memory on the pre-Vatican II Catholic church. The respect given to Catholic sisters at that time comes through nicely in the film.This is a relatively quiet crime film with a heist subplot, but without any car chase, exploding vehicles, or ghastly crime. How satisfying!-30-"
2,Was it Alan Ladd or George Raft ??,"This 1951 ""noir"" (?) starring Alan Ladd was nothing more than a 1930s style crime drama starring George Raft right down to the boring monotone voice.The movie started with this voiceover glorification of the Postal service employees and inspectors to the point of silliness, then typical hero (Ladd) infiltrating the bad guys and saving the day.The one bright point was seeing Jack Webb & Henry Morgan driving around in a car together just like Dragnet."
2,Save Your Money and Buy The Book!,"Although the quality of information given on the DVD is excellent, it is grossly lacking in quantity. It contains less than 1/4 of what is in the book.This DVD does include a 30 minute Q & A session with some of the audience, which is only fair at best. However, you have to go online to take the Real Age Quiz, a fact I never could find mentioned in the description. Nothing really wrong with the meager Exercise Tips.For me, this was a case of more ""sizzle"" than ""steak.""This production should have included the entire 130 or so recommendations as covered in the book, or it should have plainly said that it did not cover what the book does.This DVD is really just a promotion to get you to buy the book.Again,I found this to contain excellent information, just not enough to warrant buying this instead of the book."
3,It's an aif filter!,"Providing the rebates come through, there is nothing better then owning free air filters. In the future, would I pay more for this style of filter that requires special cleaners and oil in order to make it last a lifetime? . . . ""No.""Would I buy the ""Air Hog"" again if the cost is less then the equivalent disposable paper filter? . . . ""You bet I would purchase this style of filter again! It is very well made!""Yes these filters are more durable then their equivalently made paper filters, but I do not hold much faith in any filter that is claimed to last a lifetime. After approximately one year of use I intend to dispose of the lifetime filter instead of buying the needed cleaner and oil to maintain it. By the time one purchases the cleaners and oil for the lifetime filter, the cost is probably not much cheaper then if one were to replace the filter at regular intervals with a brand new disposable paper filter.Everyone has their own opinions and this is just mine."
1,RIPPED OFF PAID FOR 2 GOT 1,paid for a 2 pack and got 1 tried to cantact but no pesponce.so watch out they may rip you off to.
4,Here is the reference book you have been wanting to take to Haiti with you.,If you are trying to understand Haitian voodooism this book goes a long way to providing an interesting read and a great reference book to carry along to Haiti on your next trip. it has many of the drawings you will find upon Haitian ground and explanations along with many terms that are helpful to the explorer.
1,Just awful and ignorant,"After reading several books to seek more knowledge about the Vodou tradition, this one is by far the worse source of information I have ever encountered. I started reading this book and before I passed the first chapter I was dumbfounded by his definitions and comparisons. So I decided to skim through the book and kept finding inconsistencies as well as some appalling assumptions. I don't know where this author got his information but this book should not be sold or bought because I feel that this book is an insult to such a beautiful religion."
4,well i spent alot of time on this book and it was ok,well like i said i spent a lot of time on this book and i thought i could 've done better on it if i wasn't in such a hurry to finish it
3,Just a college essay on Voodoo,The author is writing for a Euro audience and has taken GREAT creative writing liberties in trying to tie in Voodoo with Moses and ancient Ethiopia or Cush.This book isn't meant for anyone who is from this heritage and culture.Some of the things that this author says is just flat out made up and fantasy.He knows nothing about Louisiana Creole tradition or African American tradition and can't write on it but he has studied some Jewish Kabbalah and mixes voodoo up with other mystical practices in an attempt to root Voodoo in some biblical text-which simply isn't true.
3,Excellent Voodoo Reference,"As an aspiring author myself, I purchased this book to use as reference.I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. The book was written in the 1950's by a man who was raised in Haiti and thus offers first hand accounts of a few specific ceremonies and how they are performed. It also includes several lovely veves and interesting photographs along with translations of ritual chants used by Haitian practitioners.Lists of Loas by nation and descriptions of some of the more prominent ones were quite helpful.I am sure the religion has changed and adapted over the past few decades, and this book covers only the voodoo practiced in Haiti. I am still searching for a fresher take Voodoo practiced in America but this book is a wonderful starting point and I am sure it will help my Mama-Loa character seem much more realistic now that I understand more of the religion and its history."
1,Kinda Boring....Bruce what were you thinking!,This movie could have had potential...but it did not take you anywhere. It left you feeling like you watched a bunch of action with no real plot or story. This movie was too simple...Terrorist....Threat.....Kill terrorists....Movie over. Denzel plays his part like you would expect(same part as any other movie he plays) and Bruce willis was horrible. Keanue Reeves acted better in Bill & Teds than Bruce did this movie!
1,There is a reason not to release this,"I kept waiting and it never went anywhere. The acting was great, the story was a dud. If they had stayed with one of the multiple story lines they would have been better off."
1,Item did not come in case,DVD arrived in a plastic bag. This is very dissapointinng. There was no DVD cover with the title of the DVD or brief description. It was just a plain Old DVD.
2,terrible,"this movie is just a complete joke,washington is a great actor but besides tha the plot of the movie could of been directed much better by a 10 year old"
1,Horrible!,"I wish there was a zero star rating because that what this movie deserves. Talented actors such Bruce Willis, Denzel Washington and Annette Benning wasted their time in this movie. I wasted two hours watching this movie."
1,Is there a negative star rating?,"I just want to say that this is the first DVD that i have watched since DVD came out... that I have fast forwarded. I forwarded this at x60 speed at times. THIS IS A REAL BORE. and a lets cry for the races picture. It is an anti army picture. "" the army is the bad guy... blah blah blah. Havent we had enough of this ""get the races mad at each other "" type film."
1,Liberal motivated rubbish !,"This film disgusted me when I saw it BEFORE 9/11 and disgusts me even more now as it is an obvious ""Hollywood Agenda"" movie trying to push this idealistic political view of ""love the enemy trying to kill you fueled by their insane views and hatred of their own existence"".With Annette Bening in it , is it any surprise this is a HEAVILY BIASED view of how to handle problems in today's world by avoiding to confront them and cover our eyes and ears to harsh realities.Hopefully the real events of September 11, 2001 will prove how ignorant and misguided this film was in its presentations and viewpoints !"
3,The World Serious,"This movie really needs a sense of humor. It presents a nightmarish scenario very realistically, but it's too grim and intense, while the characters weren't appealing enough to make me stay interested."
3,THE SIEGE - DTS,"ANYTHING WITH DENZEL WASHINGTON IN IT IS PRETTY MUCH A GUARANTEE OF A GOOD MOVIE AND THIS ONE WAS NO EXCEPTION. I HADN'T SEEN IT BEFORE, SINCE I VERY, VERY SELDOM EVER GO TO THE THEATERS ANYMORE. I HAVE TOO GOOD A HOME THEATER AT HOME TO BE BOTHERED WITH THE PARKING AND THE CROWDS. THE ONLY EXCEPTION ALL YEAR WAS THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF LORD OF THE RINGS.GOOD ACTION IN ""THE SEIGE""."
1,don't buy it,"it's a very bad movie , don`t buy it , don`t even think about it , there is no action in this movie i can find action in playing basketball with an old man ."
2,Tale of 2 movies.,"This movie started out well and with a good premise: terrorism in the US. Mid-way through the movie, it became this preachy junk about how we shouldn't judge people just because they are the same nationality or race as some bad guys. Well, Duh! It's political correctness run amok as you must suspend disbelief if you have any hope of enjoying this movie. Hopefully, someone will do a movie along these lines that makes some sense."
3,Entertaining on one level but not deep,"While the Siege is a decent evenings entertainment, it does sort of require that you send your brain away for two hours. There are plot holes aplenty which, for the most part, Denzel Washington's solid performance make up for. Annette Bening's role could have been better written. As a matter of fact, I think she's a bit miscast. She does however try, which is more than I can say for Bruce Willis who barely acts at all. He's perfected the art of smugness. While I gave it three stars it's actually closer to two and a half."
2,Kept looking at my watch.,"All the best scenes for this film seem to have been in the preview trailers. By the time anything substantial started to happen, it was time for the film to end and I had long before lost interest."
3,Too many stereotypes,"This movie had a lot of promise with Willis, Washington and Benning. Unfortunately even they couldn't save the script. It was too predictable, not original, and stereotyped Arabs. I give it 3 stars (1 for each of the main stars)."
4,Simply Brilliant,"Are you looking for the typical Hollywood action film where you can switch your brain off? Stay away from this film. Instead if you like almost-real political and social plots, watch it: the 'what-if' questions this film raises make the audience think. And that's a very good result for a film."
4,Good thriller,"A good film, the scenario is really interesting, and seems quite realistic. I really enjoyed it, although Bruce Willis is a bit disappointing in this film (but the others are great)."
4,Original and Thrilling!,"Anyone who believes that this was an Arab-bashing movie is either grossly mistaken or they simply missed the point of the film. That aside, it was a very intense and unique look of many ""what ifs"" in New York City. Washington as always displayed a convincing performance as we all as the cold Bruce Willis. Like it or hate it, this movie is interesting and will keep you intrigued to the end about the outcome."
2,Bad attempt for a Hollywood blockbuster!,"I would expect nothing less from such a wonderfull cast. However, after watching this long and tedious film, I have learned to never expect anything from this not so wonderfull cast. This movie started very slow, continued through at a slow pace, and concluded at a slow pace. Follow a pattern here? The cinematography is well done and the musical score does help. However I strongly suggest that you stay away from this movie, it is a big BOMB. (no pun intended)"
3,"A ""terrorists come to Brooklyn"" movie...","The Siege is basically a ""terrorists come to Brooklyn"" movie. It stars Denzel Washington as leader of a FBI team investigating terrorist cells in NYC, Annette Bening as a sly and shifty CIA agent. Bruce Willis as the two-star Army general who brings his troops to town, and Tony Shalhoub as Washington's Arab-American partner (nice job, Tony).So what happens WHEN things start blowing up? The FBI works flat out in stopping the bad guys. There are jurisdictional issues with other agencies. Shadowy folk remain shadowy. There are power plays. People want the ear of the president. And there are victims, heros, and villains. This movie has them all.The plot had a convincing build-up, but the conclusion was a bit anti-climatic. The final cell was a bit too Hollywood, with everybody showing up at just the right time... and in the unoccupied public baths?However, this movie is worth viewing for those first 80 minutes."
4,the siege,"hey it's ok of a movie but i wanted it as part of a terrorist investigation see how the terrorist leader in the movie has a girlfriend with the same name as mohammed atta? also she's from frankfurt> like atta's girlfriend see the scene where denzel throws his coffee cup at the bus driver? it's a 1997 movie about 4 groups of terrorists but it's kind of opposite of a simultaneous attack by being a siege but... kind of tells you in advance like the movie ""the fighting kentuckian"" or ""suddenly"" or ""the plainsman"" i've shown it to other people and they react by going ""well then, why...?"""
3,"Wasn't the best movie, but I still liked it.","I rented this movie because Annette Bening is in it, but I was a little disapointed. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I didn't think her character should have died. I liked some of the action scenes like the bus explosion. The movie was suspenseful and action-packed."
5,Great film!,"This is a great film about the dangers of spreading islamic extremism - the most recent case being the hijacking of the Indian Airlines plane. This gives a strong message to islamic terrorists that they better not mess with the US! These people are the most intolerant of all people. They still seem to be living in the dark ages, talking of holy wars and fatwahs everytime someone has a slightly different opinion to them! We see mosques in almost every country in the world, but how many temples, churches or sinogogues do you see in a muslim country - NONE! A movie like this was long overdue. Well done to the makers and the actors!"
1,"Place on your ""Must Avoid"" list","I found the characters to be unlikable and unbelievable. Hollywood is still batting a thousand when it comes to demonizing arabs and muslims. I think the problem with this movie, is that the action scenes are paltry and the dialogues are ridiculous. How can you suspend your disbelief when you are incredulous? This is a real stinker."
2,Predictable Action Movie!,"I have seen this movie, not a big deal! I mean the events are predictable from the start. It is like most movies. Hunt the bad guys, capture them, then kill them, the hero lasts. Nothing new or unusual about the movie in general, but it shows Arabs as Terrorists! There was no need to show some arab guys praying or citing some verses from the Holy Quran, pretending to be very Confide and defend Islam & then in another seen goes to bed with a stranger for Adultery!"
5,"barney,a dads review",My two year old just loves this movie. its very entertaining for all age groups.
3,Not my most favourite Barney but nice to have-too many ads,"I like this and I think it is fun to have around when the kids get bored with ""sing and dance"" and ""Animal ABCs"" but this frankly just never get ""going"" so to speak. A few songs are recycled and there is an unfair and offensive amount of ads at the start as PART of the actual feature presentation. in fact if you scroll through the video just simply starts. All this is great if you FF but unless your child is a wiz with the remote they'll press play and sit through ads."
5,Love Barney? Love zoo animals? then this is perfect for you!,"Perfect video for a child that loves Barney and the zoo or animals. It's a fun romp through the zoo with singing and dancing in the ""Barney"" fashion."
2,Doesn't capture attention like other Barney videos,"My 17-month old's 1st Barney DVD was Barney's Outdoor Fun and he loves watching and dancing with the kids. When the Let's Go to the Zoo DVD is on, he walks away from the TV. The kids aren't in this DVD and it's just not as much fun for me (I mean, him)."
2,Maybe for older kids?,"My 20 month olds love Barney, they started watching these a couple of months ago and I decided to stock up on a couple. They really love ""Sing & Dance with Barney"" and ""Mother Goose Rhymes"". To that point, this DVD was a let down. The previous two I mentioned have tons of songs, and I think that is what they enjoy the most. This one had songs, but not nearly as many and just couldn't keep their attention. Maybe when they are a little older..."
3,Barney at the Zoo,My one and half year old usually loves watching barney! But he doesn't seem to like this one that much because it barely has music! The great thing about this video is the real animal shots they show. He can see the animals and enjoy them. Maybe when he gets older he will be able to enjoy it more. It is not the best Barney that's been made but it is decent enough to watch!
4,"Great,awesome","This dvd is great, my two year old loves it. She enjoys viewing the elephants and monkeys. She totally loves it!!"
5,A DELIGHTFUL VIDEO FOR KIDS & ADULTS,"My 1 year old son received this tape as a gift and it is his absolute favorite tape (and his first introduction to Barney). It is shot on location at the Fort Worth Zoo which lends such a pleasant and sunny atmosphere. The songs are very catchy, and I often find myself singing along or them playing in my head during the day! They are simple but instructive songs such as ""Everybody Needs A Nap"", ""Have A Snack"", ""Growing"" and the wonderful song and dance intro ""Lets Go to the Zoo"". The choreography is perfect. Even though this is for kids, Barney, BJ and Baby Bop's tour of the zoo and their description of each animal is very interesting as well as adorable. Barney's cheerful, polite and gentle demeanor are a beautiful example for any child. I must say, in all aspects this video is beautifully produced."
4,"Good, but not great.","'Reach for the Sky' is one of Kuraki Mai's better singles, but it definately isn't one of her best. Although Mai has good skills, her skills are severely limited to only singing in Japanese. Her english is horrible and it somewhat deters from the song, especially for a person who is fluent in Japanese and English. An example of this is when she sings 'Reach for the golden ring, reach for the sky.' Her inability to sing in English makes it sound more like 'Reach for the guilden ring, reach for the sky.' Although it doesn't terribly damage the song, it's pretty funny when you hear that part. Although good, I'd recommend anyone to buy Mai's new album 'Perfect Crime' instead of buying this single."
5,"Mai-K, is the BEST POP SINGER than Hikki...!!!!","I loved this single! it become my favourite of all...! It's better than Hikki's first love. This album was quite slower than never gonna give you up and delicious way... but, it's still the best! it's really, really nice! even Mai-k is much better than Hikki! And Mai-k's pitch is a bit more higher than Hikki and i hate hikki... =P"
4,A STARTING POINT,"This is a good book if you are interested in a brief synopsis or precis of the Lewis and Clark Journals. The Introduction is informative and accurate. There is a note on the text detailing the editing process, and the constraints the author was confined to. All in all, it is a good, quick summary of the journals. It should be noted that the first entry is for May 13, 1804, so any earlier history of the expedition is ommitted. Additionally, the entries end on September 24, 1806. Basically stated, for the price it is a good value. If you are interested in a beginning primer on the expedition of Lewis and Clark, you cannot go wrong by starting here."
3,ICat noises,"I got the ICat and the only problem I have with it is when Im trying to listen to it at work I have to have the sound fairly low and when the cat starts moving his head and ears I really cant hear the music well. Other wise I love it. Wish you could turn the movements off, or maybe they should make it so that the motor isnt so loud."
4,i-love i-cat,"I bought 2 for my 2 kids and I think that I like them more than the kids do! Cute and interactive. The cat continues to make noise when the ipod is hooked up, which makes listening to anything other music a little annoying. Don't buy it to use as a speaker for your mp3 player! This is definitely more of a toy. It is pretty durable (it still works after being dropped quite a few times)!"
5,The Best Of Gladys Knight & The Pips,"The music cd - The Best Of Gladys Knight & The Pips is GREAT! The music cd has the hits - Save The Overtime ( For Me ), You're Number One ( In My Book ), Neither One Of Us and lots of other great songs. Gladys Knight & The Pips are about GREAT music. The music and the lyrics are wonderful! I highly recommend The Best Of Gladys Knight & The Pips music cd to all ( young and old ) people."
4,very good,"This sophomore effort for Cobra (Ewart Brown) find him adding interesting electronic effects, such as lasers and electronic drum kits, etc. to his infectious brand of dancehall. ""Must Drop Out"" and ""Train Length"" were minor club hits.A better than average effort for one of the new breed."
5,Madly in love with Meta!,"This is without question, Meta's best CD to date! She is funny, heart-warming, witty, and that voice: It can be playful and mysterious, and then in the next second, powerful and in your face. A smoothly rich voice to cuddle you, then knock your socks off! Each track she makes her own, & once you hear it done Meta's way, there is no going back. ""If I Were a Bell"", is especially meaningful to me. It just makes me want more, more, MORE!"
5,Incredible!,This CD is amazing! I've already bought extras to give to family members. Meta has a beautiful voice. I loved hearing those familiar songs that I haven't heard in ages. You can't help but sing along.
5,Tough -- outstanding abs workout,Keli Roberts offers continuous instruction focusing on proper form. Understanding how to isolate abdominal muscles is key to obtaining results and this workout has taught me a lot. This workout contains several levels -- allowing the user to progress to more difficult exercises.
5,NOT boring and NOT easy,"I am fit since I have been into sports as long as I can remember.But Keli's ABS tape is a CHALLENGE. I have seen many areobic instructors in my life but I have never seen so good ABS workout as the one offered by Keli. She is a professional and if you will be 100% compliant with her instructions, you will see the results fast.If you will not follow her instructions, this workout can seem to you easy. The ease should be your warning that you are doing smth wrong."
1,"Although her form is excellent, it is just too slow.","I know she's stressing form. And, I know that it's quality, not quantity, that counts. But please! It's way tooooo slow and way tooooo boring. I have gotten good results with more conventional routines so I'm going to stick with them and forget Ms. Roberts."
3,Decent Ab Workout,"This video's a little out-of-date but still a pretty good workout. It's very different from the usual crunches, etc., which is why I like it but,as other reviewers have said, it's sometimes boring and she doesn't necessarily go with the rhythm of the music. Still, it's a great ab workout if you did two or three segments together."
2,Only for wealthy stay at home moms,It's nice that she could continue to drive a BMW and get massages while staying home all day while her children were in school - this book has little to do with the reality of most stay at home moms. The book is well written - just definately not what I expected.
5,fantastic,An excellent book for all women! Very useful information for anybody looking to make the change to stay at home.
5,Great!!,"Heartwarming, entertaining and insightful stories from real moms. This book is an excellent resource for all moms!"
4,sandy,I like this product. It was larger than I expected and seems to be made well. I am well satisfied.
4,Plenty of ideas for how to use this...,This was worth the money I spent on it (not much). Nice big scoop... I have already found several uses for it in my kitchen (aside from using it with the wok). And my boyfriend claims he's going to confiscate it to use for an icefishing scoop. Hmmm.
5,spider,"I have been wanting one of these spiders for a long time but could not find one locally, so I got on Amazon and found exactly what I was looking for. I use it for a lot of different things that need straining. Deep frying, boiling, even cheese making.It gets a lot of use in my kitchen."
5,Great Strainer,This is a great little tool. It is so much better to get fried foods out than a slotted spoon. It is easy to use and fits our needs perfectly.
5,Joyce Chen,It is perfect for my needs and it took me a long time to find it and I'm glad I finally did
2,cheap and overpriced,"The product is nothing special, a stick with a basket on the end. It is poorly made and by the time you pay shipping it is overly priced. I suggest if you buy this you include it with a larger order. It does perform as one would expect and contrary to appearences is still in good condition."
1,angersome,"Handle is so rough it feels painful to hold, needs to be sanded down better! Angry. Should have gotten that more expensive one I saw here, the Tom something."
4,Ordered wrong size,I should have ordered 5 inch. But my fault. This one is huge. Very well made and worth the money
5,Works like charm,"Got this strainer for an ambitious attempt at tempura vegetables. It worked great. It's definitely on the smaller side, but I'm not sure if the bigger size would have been too cumbersome to get in and out of the frying pot. You might want to measure the pot(s) you'd be using to see if the 5 inch would work best or if you think you need the largeer one. I could get about two pieces of tempura in the strainer at one time."
5,Sri Ramanand Sagar's Service to India,"Sagar Films have done extensive research and selected the most important stories, especially from the Puranas, to come up with this excellent television series. While it did not have the success of other Sagar series, Ramayan, for example, this program is very valuable in informing the Indian youth of their roots and traditions."
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I have been very happy with the ""KKSF FM 103.7 Sampler for AIDS Relief"" series of smooth jazz CDs and I had been hoping for more of the same. The music on this set of discs is all of high quality, but is of a very different style and not at all the kind of smooth jazz I like."
2,If you like oldies & Boring in Jazz...,"But I don't, plus they said there'd be three CDs and there were only two. I felt cheated. Never again.... Crappy buy."
1,They're not gonna get us--and I'm not gonna get their CD!,"Ok, I'll admit that I somewhat liked their first single, All the Things She said, but it didn't take long for that one to get old. The fact that they're lesbian lovers or whatever they're pretending to be just seems to be a record selling gimmick to me. I don't think this song is very good at all, in fact, all it is is another techno-pop song with a bunch of screaming in the background.I don't think these girls will last very long. Their music is way over produced and they could never perform their songs live as they sound on the CD. What's the point in making a record if you can't do it live? It's like Milli Vanilli all over again. Hey, all they'd have to do is put on a couple of Jamaican wigs...In my opinion, these girls will last just about as long as the Spice Girls did."
3,Not quite what I had expected,"This book is BEAUTIFULLY illustrated, although it wasn't all I had thought it would be. I was hoping for more of a ""cutsie"" country style. However, the projects in this book are geared more towards a colonial/country look."
4,Air Cleaner Filter Replacement Kit,"I got one kit just in case, and can recommend having one as a backup. So far, I've washed the original set that came in the air cleaner twice, with no noticeable breakdown of the pleated filter. The rubber gasket seems like it will last indefinitely, and there is no structural breakdown when you wash it.Washing the filter is a bit of a mess, but obviously the low-cost option for keeping your air filter running. Keep one of these kits for the day you don't have time or interest in washing the original one, or when you do wind up seeing the pleated filter break down.Eventually, I would guess the pleated filter will break down, and you may also tear the foam part, so keeping a spare set handy is a good idea. I do like the 1030000 air cleaner -- saves your lungs AND prevents dust from escaping if you have a basement workshop..."
2,Not as advertised,"I returned this product. It is advertised with a resolution of 800x600, when in fact the resolution is 640x480. The item worked well, the interchangeable frame was nice, but I felt that it was overpriced with that lower resolution. I explained to Amazon's customer service that the specs on this item are incorrect, but it appears that they did not change the listing.Amazon was very easy to work with in processing the return."
3,For collectors of pure crap,"This was a waste of time. When watching this movie the real challange is to stay focused and watch the whole thing through. The photography is dismal to say the least, the monster is another rubber suit that was recycled from/into other monsters from this genre, and the plot is dreadful.For a one word review, imagine Homer Simpson's voice here.... ""Boring."""
2,The Inside Scoop on the Phantom,"I am so amazed to see people spending so much time watching and reviewing this movie! I thought my family was the only group left on the earth to watch it! I am especially impressed by your fine observations about the unweildy monster suit! And I am equally amused by your observations about the poor man in the suit!Here is the secret you have all been dying to know--it wasn't a man in that suit, but a woman! In fact it was my grandmother, Norma Hanson. And the young teenage girl on the beach with the boy was my mother! So you can see my family has reason to sit around and watch this movie.If you have no other interest in the movie (like your mom in a bathing suit), I really can't see watching it for free, let alone buying it!Cheers!"
1,"radiation, monsters, babes on the beach, and good guys from the government","I love old monster movies when they have a jot of originality and acting that isn't at least bad. Alas, some monster movies are so bad that you can't even laugh at them. The rubber suit looks ridiculous but not funny, there is nothing to generate any interest in sitting through it, and the acting is utterly abysmal.Not recommended. Like really really not recommended."
2,Classic D- Film!,"It's a CLASSIC D- FILM ..!!!Pre-Movie Note:I'm getting ready to get into this incredibly horrible fim with cheesy special effects: from 1955 ... The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues ..!!With posters like this, you *know* it's good ..!!Post-Movie Note:Okay ... This movie really blows ... it's gotten far too serious and there's only one sea monster that moves as slow as a turtle and head butts boats with his horns to tip the folks over who, just a moment ago, were swimming past him. He's funny to watch but you don't see enough of him.AND ... there's no sexy chick being groped by a leering sea monster like the poster suggests*"
3,bass shy,"Sounds OK, but very shy on bass. I called Cambridge and they even stated this speaker needs a sub to sound great. Installed in my living room and it sort of sounds like a table radio is on, which is a bummer when you realize that I'm pumping around 75 watts per channel into it with bass on full blast."
3,Fair to so so cd,Songs 5&6 best songs on this cd were awesome. The rest of this cd was so so to not so good. Needs better material to for instrument playing & better songs to hear what kind of voice she has to show it more up front then have like its in the back ground over powered by instruments needs better arrangements of rest of cd. Id wait to see if her next cds before you buy this one. Again songs 5 & 6 were real awesome.
2,Dance of the Infidel,"I found this album dissapointing, not for the musical content, but I bought this album to hear Me'Shell NdegéOcello sing not a list of other musicians."
2,What Happened Me'shell??,"OMG I heard her perform this album live.. Now, I've heard all of her previous albums but not this one.. so I went to the performance thinking she would sing.. much to my surprise it was basically a buncha instruments attempting the most choatic form of jazz I have ever heard.. imagine elevator music that has the opposite effect of soothing and you have this album.. In fact, if the songs didnt have titles.. u wouldnt really know wether or not they were indeed different tracks, or a huge jumbled together song.. I have never been so dissapointed in an artist ever.. Its like Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and others who have incredibly powerful voices and decide nah im gonna play a guitar and let everybody with an instrument have a 5 minute solo.. This is nothing like her previous work.. I am sorry but I absolutley hated it"
1,I would never buy this kind of jazz.,"I can't give her a half a star? Yep, I heard Me'shell for the first time in quite awhile on XM Radio just recently. Her new jazz album is being featured alot lately, which is too bad, because I like Beyond Jazz on XM, but I have to turn to a different channel everytime I hear that dreadful sax player she's got playing with her. If you like ""stress-free"" jazz, definately stay away from this one. I like Me'Shell from back-in-the-day!"
4,Another solid effort from Meshell,"Meshell continues to grow and evolve as an artist. Dance of the Infidel is both funky and smooth at times while challenging the listener. The songs sound very inspired. I agree with the other reviewer in wanting Meshell to do another jazz project. I hope she will include more of her bass skills on future works, which is limited on this project. However, her ability to oversee and produce talented musicians and singers on this project more than makes up for her limited bass playing. The musicianship is excellent."
4,"Wow, What A Departure!!","I love this CD! This is not your usual Me'Shell - no clever lyrics, no lament about love, just music, music, and more music. Papillon is my favorite cut on this CD, but I love the vocal stylings of Lalah Hathaway and Cassandra Wilson and whoever is singing ""I'm a fish in an aquarium."" This is a great CD to put on when you're entertaining company or home alone. Another winner, Me'Shell!!"
1,Going through the Motions Song,"13 Years Ago this Song was Better as ""Around The World Girl"" but in 2003 it seems like a Cat just hanging on or just getting by with whatever.""Loungin"" was tighter than this Cut as well.it's a Safe Re-Thread For LL.but I remember When LL truly challenged Himself."
2,One song does not make a CD.,"My mistake. I usually know better to try a CD based upon one song. Oh, well, maybe I can sell it at a yard sale, if anyone really knows Maxwell."
1,Wack,"1. This woman's work was weak, not to mention it is already on another album. Stick to your own stuff Maxwell.2. Sounds like RKelly or someother R&B no talent wrote and produced this mess. Drum machine, drum machine. I thought you had more skills than that!?3. Maxwell fell off with this effort. He has been removed from the ""artists I always buy without hearing a song first"" list."
4,Right Now,"Maxwell's third studio album is a mature step forward for the neo-soulman. He moves nicely through ballads and adds a little funkiness to the mix. He originally covered Kate Bush's ""This Woman's Work"" on MTV Unplugged album, but he ups the ante with this amazing version. He completely captures the feeling of the song and gives an impassioned performance. He has some fun with the closing ""Now/At The Party"" and in between songs like ""Get To Know Ya"", ""Silently"" & ""For Lovers Only"" standout."
5,gorgeous,"Less a ""suite"" like each of the first two studio albums were and more a simple collection of well-crafted songs, this is a beautifully cohesive set that satisfies on all levels. It's undoubtedly more commerical than Embrya but continues Maxwell's stunning use of funky basslines, soulful vocals and crisp production. Highlights are the funky No One and the introspective Changed and Lifetime. Beautiful!"
5,Maxwell has done it again,"I was simply blown away by Embrya, but Now has stayed in my disc player for months now. Maxwell takes you back to the days of real music. You don't get too much of that nowadays."
5,Maxwell is amazing.,One of the few online purchases I made for myself. Love this cd. Arrived as indicated. Will purchase more music in the future.
4,Now THIS is music!,"Anyone who was an R&B; fan during the 90's probably remembers when Maxwell first hit the scene in '96 with his hit ""Somethin' Somethin'"".Now Maxwell has done it again, with this 2001 release. I managed to get a burned copy of this from a friend and I must say, that I'm certainly glad I did. Although ""Get to Know ya"" is my least favorite song, all the songs are good. ""W/As My Girl"" and the hit cover of Kate Bush's ""This Woman's Work"" in my opinion are the best songs on here. And I'm sure you've all heard ""Lifetime"" by now, but as much as the stations overplayed it, its still a good easy-listening as well as inspirational song.I could go on all day about how good this CD is, but I recommend you try it for yourself. If you're as sick of the B2K's and the Bow Wow's as I am, then give this a shot. Even for a mere 10 tracks, I still think this is a very good album. Good work Maxwell!The is Matsudo Kenji, OUT!*disappears*"
4,LIBERATED MODERN MALE SOUL,"Maxwell's voice and vocal talents,coupled with a more organic and dynamic sound,makes for a decent album.He shows that neo-soul,if that is what modern soul considers itself to be called,doesn't just include D'angelo, Badu, Scott, Bilal, Patterson,Benet and David-Hall.'Now' is such a blend of hard soul and heavier rock, that he make it seem so easy to do what others have failed.He clearly knows that from 'embrya', his material maybe great-yet he has to broaden his sound to other potential fans.Great ,reflective soul for the liberated listener."
4,Vibe.......2 Tha Max.,"This is another one of those albums that has to grow on you. When I originally reviewed this, I tore it apart and now I feel sort of embarassed. There are some good songs on ""Now"", it just took awhile to discover them. My favourite trax are ""'Get To Know Ya"", ""Lifetime"", ""No One"", and the sad and haunting song ""For Lover's Only"". This is an introspective album that gets into your soul, 2 tha Max-well."
4,Solid Effort!,"I really like this cd.It's more like his first cd, but It's a little different.It sort of lags a little In the middle,(very little) but I would give it 4 and a half stars If your rating system was set up that way.Anyway, the best description I can It Is that It Is a funky mellow-fest and It definitely will be one of the cd's that burn my player for a long time. peace."
3,Hit&Miss,this Album starts strong then Crashes in the Middle.the Man has a Decent Voice&Feeling in His Stuff.but nothing for me on a whole has come close to His First ALbum IMHO.the Writing at times is so-so&The Production after a while just kinda gets Predictable.I still feel that if Given the Chance to Be the all he can Be Artist that He could make a Few Important Albums doen the line.but Right Now the Best of Him hasn't come to View.so we shall see.
3,Besides him being a hottie!...,"He can sing me to sleep every night! he's so talented...Has a great voice & the words to the songs...it may not be his best work.....but, its maxwell!"
2,Dissapointed fan of the music,"Very dissapointed. Many of the songs sound same as eachother. No stand out tracks other than ""get to know ya"". Everything else feels so languid and lush, which I know many folks enjoy but I feel like we've already been there done that with Urban Hang Suite. It is not as strong lyrically of as Embrya. Sounds more like story telling rather than poetry. Very dissapointed, NOW was not worth the wait."
2,"Can I Have My Money Back......""Now?""","""Urban Hang Suite"" will always be a classic in my collection. Live, Maxwell is electrifying. I am a fan, so don't crucify me.... :) What starts off with a promising first track, ""Get to Know Ya,"" quickly deteriorates into listenable background music. That would be a compliment for a lesser artist, but I expect something far more original from such a talented man. I'd skip this one."
5,Maxwell is a Super Soul Brother,this cd is just another gem in his amazing collection....LUV it...MAXWELL keep producing that sweet soul music
4,"Now, let's try to make a classic.","This imitated classic cover hids soulsongs so beutiful and fragile as the winter night itself, nicely vocals on a carpet of funky drums and guitars, dreaming popsongs that persist that reality could be beutiful even when it feels hard. Maxwell have made a great album, not so funky as the last one but likwise made of great singing. I would have expected one or two covers but never one from Kate Bush. 'This womans world' shows what a great soulsinger Maxwell really are. Despite this wellsewed album, the cover makes me play Gil Scott-Heron's 'pieces of a man' once again, and compere to that... well he's not there yet.."
4,Almost Perfect: I'd give this a 4.5 out of 5 stars.,"Judging from some of the reviews that I have read regarding this album, you would think that this album was the biggest let-down of the year. However, after purchasing this album, I have a different opinion. I have liked this album more and more with each listen. Jewels like Noone(my personal favorite), Changed, Get To Know Ya, W/As My Girl and Temporary Nite make this album a must-have. I own all of Maxwell's albums and I enjoy this album just as much as his previous work. This is another album that I will add to my year's top ten favorites. I was pleasantly surprised with my purchase."
3,so/so,"i loved 'lifetime', 'get to know ya' and 'temporary nite' but i tried to but i just can't get myself to like the other cuts off of his new cd...i know that a lot of folks did not like 'embrya' but i loved the 1998 cd...i simply cannot get enough of listening to 'lifetime' and 'get to know ya'...everyone is different buy it maybe you will like 'now'...it is so hard to get cd singles that you have to get the entire cd to hear the two...but it comes out the same in cost..."
5,Excellent.,"Okay, perhaps I'm biased, but I really like this guy! NOW is refreshing for everything it's not, overblown, pretentious, vulgar and mindless. While this work sounds very insular (but more open-ended than the masterpiece ""Embrya'), it has an overall feel of joy, release and contentment. Special kudos to the production team for the bright sound and clarity of the vocals and the tracks, very nice work. And thanks to Maxwell for getting to point and then dropping it (ie; at just over 50 minutes the disc isn't so long it bores you and has no filler), proving that restraint is a good thing. Current fave? ""Get To Know Ya'""! The horns make me feel so happy! The ""MUSZE"" is back!"
5,Another Truimph,"Maxwell's latest album is called NOW, and it's one of his best. He sure doesn't disapoint folks. NOW has everything you would want, some real funky beats and rhythms that will make you want to head for the dancefloor, the tender beautiful ballads that show true raw emotion from Maxwell, everything you would expect and more. My favorite tracks are ""Get To Know Ya"" a hot upbeat song with nice fanfare on it, ""This Woman's Work"" which should be a huge hit, a beautiful tender ballad that will make you melt when you hear it, and other favorites include ""Lifetime"", ""Temporary Nite"", ""Was My Girl"" to name a few, but the whole album is excellent. It was well worth the wait!"
3,Maxwell?,"I hate to be the one to break up the momentum praise, however, I was rather disappointed in Maxwells latest attempt. I've been hooked on Maxwell, ever since Urban Hang Suite, it appealed to my jazzier side. I fell in love with the seductive Embrya. Now I'm listening to ""Now"" wondering what happened. ""Now"" is just a little too R&Bish for me (sorry R&B fans). I've always viewed Maxwell as being more on the alternative soul side. I really dug Maxwells independence, musical talent, and vision, but this album has me a little stumped. During the course of the past few years, several have tried to master his style and skill and have failed miserably. ""Now""-a-days Maxwell sounds a lot more like those who have tried."
5,'Now' is Hot!!!!!!,"I luv this cd as much as URBAN HANG SUITE and EMBRYA. Still wondering why so many of you had such difficulty comprehending EMBRYA's lyrics. The songs of EMBRYA are incredibly sensual. Listen again and follow along with the printed lyrics. NOW's songs are proof of Maxwell's evolution as a singer/songwriter. This cd has the great love songs we've come to expect & jams that make you want to shake your groove thang. Thanx Max, for more great music. I can't wait to see Maxwell in concert in DC next month and hear these new songs live!"
4,choice cuts,"This album is very good. The sound production is stellar. The guitar is beyond belief, and plays second fiddle only to Maxwell's voice, which is so hauntingly beautiful, it will stand your hair on end."
3,same old rehash,i purchased this album after much anticipation expecting new and exciting music from maxwell instead both myself and my daughter were disappointed. it sounds very much a rehash of old materials new lyrics but same texture
3,"Not great, nor bad..","I was a little disappointed w/ this CD. I was expecting something closer to Urban Hang Suite, but this didn't come close. Still a Maxwell fan, I was able to enjoy the vibe he sent throughout this album. Half of the songs you will listen to and not remember the chorus, while the other half will have you programming those songs to be listened to over and over. No need to rush to get this."
2,Disappointed,"I love his music but you must admit that Maxwell really needs to use another producer for his work. Except for a few tracks, the rest of the CD is pretty much the same sort of music on all his CD's, kinda weird except for a few tracks. He should really look at using other producers for his music like R. Kelly who wrote a very simple song in ""fortunate"" but it was a hit. If Maxwell wants to have a mega hit again like ""urban hang suite"", he has to get out of ""his World"" and allow someone else guide him musically. He seems to be on an endless journey and by now, many people hope he hurry up and find himself so we can get to good music again."
5,Bakuretsu is worth it,"For those of you who remember the days of fan subs, Bakuretsu Hunters (Sorcerer Hunters) was one of the best titles out there. And it still is. Where else you can find a guy who turns into a beast of destruction that must be whipped back to human form by VERY scantily glad, gorgeous women as a central plot theme? Aside from that, the story is good and stands on its own merit, the animation is excellent for the time it was produced in, and the characters will leave you in hysterics. If you're looking to get into Anime, or have been in the know for a while and haven't checked out this title, you won't regret it."
3,Not as good as the manga...,"Having the first eight Sorcerer Hunters' books I figured to try out the anime. I was somewhat unimpressed with it.The artwork is OK, the music was nice and some of the stories come right out of the manga, but the delivery was flawed. The anime's rhythm was off, as it tried to be funny when it should be serious and it was serious when it should be funny. The humor was light and not as kinky as I would have liked.Even the voices seemed a tad off which really killed it for me. Voice work is very important to the feel of any anime, just look at ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Tenchi Muyo!"" or even ""Those Who Hunt Elves!""The DVD had seven episodes and I barely remember ANY of them!I don't think I'll be ordering the other DVDs (unless somebody tells me they get A LOT BETTER than this one)."
1,Forgettable,"This movie is so forgettable that I am sure that I have watched it before. Don't waste your time. Although it has a good overall feminist theme, the acting, plot, and script were useless. It's pretty predictable as well.If you must watch this drivel, wait for it to appear on cable."
3,WAIT A MINUTE! what's this business about Tinka?????,"what??????at the end when they're rolling the girls' grown-up bios, it says something like ""In a 1997 Barbara Walters interview, actress Tinka came out.""what the @$%*??????she was so into that adorable Snake boy!!! not to mention, it seemed like she was into boys throughout the movie. what in the world were the writers thinking??? implying that she grows up to be a lesbian?! that isn't consistent at all with her character! i don't understand...."
5,"FANTASTIC MOVIE, with stunning actors/actresses","At first I was sceptical of the quality of this film, because of the title, the plot . . . it didn't sound sound very exciting. But I can assure you, this movie is VERY good. Cook (Abby), Dunst (Verena), and Hoffman (Odette) played inspiring characters, and less known Keena (Tinka), and Kartheiser (Snake) were fabulous and are great new actors! I found the idea of the DAR (Daughters of the American Ravioli) very inspiring. The whole movie gives young women courage. It tells a wonderful story about five girls with ambition and plans, it tells about the obstacles they overcome. I definately recommend this movie!"
4,good,This movie is really funny. I would recommend it. It arrived on time and in the condition that was stated.
4,Cute and fun girl power flick!!!,"This is a fun movie, perfect for budding young feminist! I saw this in college with some friends and we had a blast. This would be perfect for a blast from the past party, or a girl's night in!"
5,All I Wanna Do,All I wanna Do is my all time favorite movie. This movie stands up for girls and mixes it with a little humor. I can't see why anyone wouldn't like it. Even parents because it teaches you some real good values. Hope you enjoy this as much as i have.
3,"Watchable, but not great","Very average film that feels strained. It is trying too hard to come up with standout catchphrases and unique characters, and it feels forced. Sometimes there are large plot gaps that make no sense. However, there are some very enjoyable moments and great actresses that will keep you interested. ..."
2,What i wanna was an even movie,"Pretty much all this film is good for is a see it once rental, because it had so much promise but never delivered plus i thought it was too much over the top male bashing to actually enjoy. i rent the dvd because i liked the other films these actresses have been in and decided to give it a shot but i simplely found this movie to be a little self service in the script for my taste and lacking any substance or any real depth and it was uneven all around. all in all this film stinks and i so badly want to like it too what a shame.it's worth 49.cents to me. what junk."
5,Cute film.,"I thought this film had originality, sure, there's been alot of films on boarding school, but this one was different. It was terribly cute in certain scenes and while cheesy, I think the fact that it had so many great unknown actresses (and actors) really made up for that. I got to see so many people I liked in one film that are rarely seen at all, let alone together.The soundtrack is also really nice, though I don't think they sell it, they had it available on the films website before, but they've since taken the website down.I suppose this would be called a 'chick flick', and it is. It would be cute to watch at a sleepover, with your girlfriends, or a mum and daughter would also enjoy watching it together."
2,Two to Three Worthwhile Songs Surrounded by Mediocre Stuff,"P, S, R & T contains a much nicer mix of music from top to bottom. I would say that this CD is their weakest. Love America, Mrs. R and Zoo. The rest bore me. Wed. am 3am although capturing them in a cruder moment, is richer by far in total, IMHO. Outside of the above 3 songs, this CD bores me."
2,Just Fair,"I have heard this cd and compared to their other efforts, this cd is only mildly interesting. Granted it has a couple of excellent songs on it: ie America, Mrs. Robinson and Bookends, but the remaining and surrounding music is plain filler to my ears. PSRT is a much more complete cd. You can get the best of this cd on their greatest hits cd. Don't waste your money, buy their greatest hits and obtain Wednesday Morning 3am and PSRT for your collection."
2,???????????,"I just purchased this cd, loaded it, and then proceded to fast forward through most of the songs. People, and the album jacket, claim this is their 'best' album???????I must be living on a different plain.....this cd was a waste of money, I doubt I'll play it again."
4,"It was Five Stars without the ""Bonus Tracks""","This is a great album, one of my favorites. I bought the CD to replace the cassette that replaced the LP. I'll never get tired of listening to it. The two tracks stuck on the end don't belong there though. They subtract from the whole rather than adding to it. I'm glad I have a CD burner so I can make a copy without them."
4,Like it don't love it,"I admit that I find some of the songs on this CD to be my favorite S&G songs, such as ""America,"" ""Old Friends,"" and ""Bookends Theme."" But, there are also a couple of my least favorite S&D songs on here, ""Mrs. Robinson,"" and ""Save the Life of my Child."" So I give it a 4. It is still a wonderfully done CD just as melodic and thoughtful as their other CD's, but just not one of my favorites."
4,"Great, but not best...","I really love Simon and Garfunkel, and this album is really great, but I beg to differ with the above reviewer that it's Simon and Garfunkel's best...maybe second or third best...try Bridge Over Troubled Water before you try this one, and if you like that, then Parsely, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme...or P, S, R and T before BOTW, either way, it doesn't matter, but those'll get you into the Simon and Garfunkel style better than Bookends...which is not their best..."
3,a rough portrait of the hero,"I read the book with real interest but I found it somewhat patchy with odd innacuracies. There are chunks of Phil's early life where there is a real feel for the guy whereas when he was at his peak, the account sounds spasmodic. What it hasn't really integrated is an overall view, in particular Phil's drive for success as opposed to his very real idealism for the causes he supported. Marc's shared interest with Phil was with the movies which creates limits in his perception - the annex drawn from the FBI file starts to fill in the gaps.The guy was fated by his vulnerabilities and the downturn in American radical politics which caused his downfall. Ironically, as time has gone on Phil's songs have become more relevant than ever, with only an occasional change of name."
4,Interesting,"I didn't know a lot about Phil Ochs though I knew who he was and I knew about a few of his songs. The book was insightful and full of details surrounding Phil's troubled life. I got the impression that he could have been in the major league had it not been for his own ego getting in the way and also maybe if he had concentrated more on his singer/songwriter career instead of wasting his time on the anti-establishment scene, he would have made it to the top. The author did an excellent job of putting it all on the table in a way that gave us a look behind the scenes. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to know more about Phil's life and the 60's folk scene."
5,One of Warlow's Best,Anthony Warlow is Australia's most talented and powerful musical theatre/opera singer. His voice is shown off most exceptionally in this CD. The first track Music of the Night gets the CD off to a very fitting start. This track truly shows why he was Australia's Phantom in 1991. His rendition of Anthem from Chess is the best around. It is incredibly powerful and emotional. His version of Bring Him Home is amazing. In my opinion he sings it better than any of the people that have been Jean Valjean. Lastly both Soliloquy and The Impossible Dream shows off Warlow's ability to adopt a great character voice all the while maintaining an amazing quality of singing. This is one of Warlow's better CDs and is highly recommended as it has so many great songs sung by possibly one of the world's greatest male vocalists.
5,"Old music, wonderful.",I love coming across old music that I had forgot that I just love. It is not only wonderful but real fun!
4,"Great music, but 5 CDs?","This is undeniably wonderful music, among the best of its time -- and that's saying something since S&G;'s recorded history from 1964-70 exactly overlaps that of the Beatles. I could listen to it over and over and never grow tired of it. (Well, maybe the first CD is a bit tiresome, but that's a minor quibble.) And while I love the idea of reissuing the 5 CDs exactly as they were originally released, with the covers and labels and everything, I can't help feeling just a little cheated.I noticed each CD has about 30-45 minutes of music, even with the bonus tracks. You could certainly fit it all onto 3 or maybe 4 CDs and save a bit of money. At full price, this isn't a bargain. But if you can find it on sale -- as I did, for half-price -- then it's a good deal. This is beautiful music. Own it, definitely. Just watch out for the price."
5,Best of the Best,"I have loved the music of Simon and Garfunkel since I was in my teens. My youngest daughter bought this collection for me a year ago, and recently my middle daughter, also an avid fan, told me all she has are the old records, no CD's. I bought the collection to give her for her birthday in July. This collection has all the great songs as well as some I had not been familiar with but also now greatly enjoy. The booklet that comes with the set has some interesting history of the duo and their fabulous music. These CD's are my most played music! If you love Simon and Garfunkel, this is the collection for you!"
1,You have to download Amazon software into your PC...,I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software. The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it. Blah. You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.
3,Big disappointment,"I love Danny Phantom and I am still a fan as of now. However, when I got both season 1 and 2 (or so it claims on the DVDs) I was thinking I would have all the eps and watch them even after the show was canceled. However, I was very disappointed to see only just half the eps from season 1 on the first packet and the rest of it on the second one with just a few eps of season 2. My advice for all of you who love Danny Phantom and want all of the seasons, don't get these DVDs. Buy them somewhere legally online and download them to your PC and watch them from there."
5,Undecided,"I am so interested in getting these discs, I LOVE Danny Phantom! But Im wondering, if the set isnt complete which has been stated by Raykel, is there any other way to get this set that IS complete? Im not going to pay that much for a set that isnt complete. Also, actually, have any new episodes been made or are being made of this cartoon? I watched it this evening with my kids and I have caught a few episodes I havent ever seen but it makes me wonder if they are still producing the cartoon. Thanks!"
5,Yess! Danny is on DVD,I have waited this for months as well as danny's fans.It is like one of my dreams con¿me true.I can't wait to have in my hands(as well as season 2 and 3)Danny Phantom Rocks!!!!!!!!!!
1,"NOT ""Complete"" as advertised","Fans have been clamoring for Danny Phantom DVDs for ages, and while it's very exciting to finally get some, this is more than a little disappointing. The back cover claims ""It's a scary good time with the COMPLETE first season of Danny Phantom."" (emphasis mine.) However, it only contains the first 13 episodes, while season one was twenty episodes long. Similarly, the ""Season Two"" set contains episodes 14-26 and does NOT include the fan favorite ""The Ultimate Enemy,"" which is probably why many fans wanted this one to begin with.Save your money for a REAL box set that has all twenty episodes, plus extras and everything a season box set should have. This, sadly, isn't it."
5,Heads up on what's up,"This book can be compared to about any ""industry specific"" magazine. For those inclined to read this ""genre"" it is best to plan ahead, and what better way than to read reviews, upcoming fairs, contest information, and advertisements from like minded people. Get a jump on the market; plan your budget. I have to admit that occasionally I find an interesting article."
4,An Amazing Journey,"Did you ever know Poke'mon even existed? Well you will find out in Poke'mon the Jhoto Journeys Teaming up with Totodile by Tracy West. It is about a boy training Poke'mon and earning badges from defeating gym leaders, to become a Poke'mon master. In his journey to become a Poke'mon master he meets new friends. This is one book in a series, so you can read more if you want.This book is good is because this book has a lot a action in it and it is interesting. Another reason is that Ash sees a Poke'mon he wants to catch ,but Misty wants to catch the Poke'mon too. There are a lot of problems to be worked out also. Tracy West has written most of these Poke'mon books, so you can read more if you like this one.I think the Tracy West's purpose was to give the reader an idea of what Poke'mon looks like and for the readers to use bigger imaginations."
4,Pretty Fair,"To me the wording in this book was strange at points.I disagree with the authors depiction of the Branch Davidians.I don't know enough about some of the other groups to say if all their info was accurate or not.It did have sections on groups I'd never heard of before.If you are interested in this subject, this book is a worthwhile read."
1,Blank book,"This book is not filled with ideas, it is filled with space. It's basically a blank book of lists for you to enter names of party guests and food served, flowers present, even a space to list food in your freezer. How helpful is it to enter a permanent list of the food in your freezer into a book? If such a list is useful to you, write it up in Word and tack a list on the freezer so you can redo it should the contents of your freezer ever change. I was expecting tips and ideas for organizing, this is not that book. This was a waste of money for me."
1,An organizer that you fill in... not a how to book.,"This book has more to do with providing a space for you to put ""your"" organized work into and then use as a reference point. So rather than go to a cook book for your roast beef recipe, then another for your rice pilaf and then yet again another for your sweet yam pie... you write them all down here. That is not a how to book if you ask me, the title and description gave me the idea that this might be a book with insight into a proper prep kitchen. I was wrong, and even at the discount price I am not pleased. If I had time to write out my planning for a party, recipe or some other event. I would do it in connection with that event. I am sorry I normally do not give one star, but I did not like the marketing aspect of this book, it was a bad trick on poor unorganized cooks."
3,Surprised,"Surprised that with his busy schedule letching on strange women, he had the time to do such an extensive and quality recording !"
5,Gripping & Pertinent!!!,"Gripping story!!! Ideal for middle school/high school boys and girls as well as adults. So pertinent to read considering the current persecution of Catholics,and other Christians, in the US and around the world. Be sure to read the brief Preface as it provides pertinent information regarding some of the historical characters.Exit question: Would I have the courage to accept the grace to suffer and endure unbearable torture and a humiliating death for my faith?"
4,"Come Rack, Come Rope","Great book, but unfortunately it is not as good as LORD OF THE WORLD by the same author - and I read that first. Still, it is a gender neutral book in the sense that men and women can enjoy it. And over the years, I feel most books are written for the female audience mostly."
4,Life saver,"I was able to attach them to my RV and they are a true life saver. They work great, and it was really easy to install. My only problem was the ground for the switch was only 6in long so I had to buy a cable to extend it."
4,Autobiography of an Elderly Woman,"The work is not what the title says it is, since the author was in her 30s when it appeared almost a full century ago. The author put herself in her widowed mother's place, and in ""1st person"" described her relationships with family, children and granchildren, and friends. The early 20th century style is a bit stilted, but the book contains some excellent observations and insights. The columnist, David Brooks, praised it very highly, for that, and for the verisimilitude the author brings off so well. His review promted me to purchase it, and I strongly agree with him."
4,"A little bulky, but good","I didn't really expect it to be as big as it was, and it gets even bigger once you start loading it up with IDs and credit cards. Either way, it's a good sturdy wallet, and I love that they are multiple transparent holders, and plenty of places to put cards.In the future, however, I may aim for a smaller wallet."
2,Crappy Sci-fi Thriller,"Kieron Moore stars in another crappy sci-fi thriller. The scientists portrayed in movies like these are pretty stupid and seem to have no oversight.Besides the ridiculous premise and bad acting this movie suffers from a low budget making the final, cataclysmic scene a cop out in the special-effects department.[DW]"
4,Great Movie,"Saw this when i was still at school so many many years ago and have not forgotten it,and the idea is not all that far fetched by todays ideas,still a great movie"
3,A cracked love story,"In an attempt to harness the world's magma core for heat and elements by a top scientist, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), a sort of surprise creates a crack in the world. Meantime Dr. Maggie Sorenson (Janette Scott) the scientist's wife is torn between two powerful men the scientist and his number two, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore) also divided by the crack.Can they join forces and save the world? They better get cracking.This film has all the elements of 1965 science fiction. Aside from Dana Andrews you will had fun trying to remember where you have seen the actors before.As with most sci-fi if the time let this be a warning against being impetuous."
3,Not all Blu-Rays are born equal,"The standard version of this looks better on my 32"" than this hi-def does on my 60"". Is it horribleand a waste of time? Certainly not! But it's combination of a tad too much contrast and a bit toolittle sharpness insure that it will not be the first one you reach for as a home theater demo."
4,Crack In The World,"Unlike some of my nostalgic purchases over the years I enjoyed watching Crack In The World again after a hiatus of over 30 years.With experience I can now say that it is rather melodramtic, something I didn't notice in my teen years when I saw it on TV. And the characters are a tiffle 2 dimensional.The effects work is still good, especially now I've seen it in widescreen even where stock footage is used. The quality of the image from the dvd is very good with clear colour and sound."
3,Classic Rock? Huh...,"Er... this would be 80's popular hits... not classic rock, as it is normally defined. Good songs if the CD were titled ""80's Hits."""
2,Spin Doctors? Classic whatnow?,"You've gotta be kidding me... The Spin Doctors are NOT I repeat NOT classic rock. Whoever made this compilation should be drug out in the street & shot for putting that song on there. It's disgraceful to put that on there and have such obvious omitions as The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath. I know it's impossible to get every classic rock band on the album, but come on, a 2 hit wonder from the 90's?"
1,Classic Rock Hits [BOX SET],"Pls tell me tat tis BoxSet is a JOKE!!!! Classic Rock - REO, Romantics ... BANGLES??? its more like Classic New Wave. Only thing good would be the price. Pls ... who ever the A&R people are ... pls ... pls ... design something better"
3,Decent,"In my opinion, this album is a little weak compared to 'At the Department of Forgotten Songs,' but well worth a listen. This CD could have been really great. It has some really pretty music and some good vocal melodies. But my two main problems with it is that the vocals are a little monotone sometimes and the lyrics are silly and offputting pretty frequently, and come off sounding forcefully and premeditatively absurd.Fans of Morrissey would probably have a predisposition for Jens Lekman's stuff."
4,I loved the little boy,"I would probably watch this movie again because it is so touching. It has sad parts, but it is very touching about the boy's determination to find his mother and what he has to go through for his attempt. It has a couple spots that are too adult-themed to be appropriate around children, in my opinion. I like the way it illustrates the culture."
3,The Russian Look at a well documented problem Universally,"If I honestly thought that I could write a better review than Amazon's I would. There is not much more that I can say except ""The Italian"" isThe Cider House Rules (Miramax Collector's Series)which isAnnie (Special Anniversary Edition)which isOliver Twist (2005)which isJane Eyre (BBC, 1983)which is the story of every orphan longing for parents and identity. Here it is Russian child selling; a young boy has been sold to an Italian couple thrilled at the prospect of having a child. Vanya experiences all of the harsh realities of the orphanage; the older children who have become somewhat of a Mafia; the older girls who sell themselves but are compassionate mother-type figures etc. Some touching moments with excellent performances, but nothing unique that has not been done before and better with flair and some soundtrack!"
1,not,it was not italian - it was russian or something - I Didn't like it - not my type of movie - kind of boring - I don't recommended it - fast forward helped.
5,Old battery lasted 7 years,One of the best things to mention about this screwdriver is the fact that you can't possibly over-tighten (and possibly break something) if you hold it with a soft grip. I have owned one of these since 1994 and just now have had to replace the batteries. I have two batteries to insure that the screwdriver is always ready to use. I bought a cordless drill and found that I could not control the force of the driver nearly as well as the Skil-Twist.
1,Vwey short time of useage,"Got about 2-3 hours of use, didn't use for months and went to use it again. The motor spun but the bit didn't move. Lots of money to turn a few screws. Seems like ""screw"" seems more applicable for the buyer than describing useage of this tool."
5,Very pleased,"This replaced my old Twist extra that was around for lots of years, and is as good or better than the old one. The convienience of charging the batteries along with the screwdriver is a plus with this new one, and the storage compartment for the included bit is handy to have.A very good tool for the price............."
4,Batteries where will we get them?,"Skil Twist Xtra or Super Fles is a fine product but as the NI Cad batteries wear out I looked locally at Sears, Lowes, anmd Home Depot there are none except at Home Depot where they are on clearance. So once gone they won't have them any more either........so?"
4,"Had one for a couple of years, works great","I have had this screwdriver for a couple of years now and it has always worked great. I bought it to replace a prior Skil brand driver that was just a bit too weak. The power of this unit has always been good. I like the fact that the battery charges inside the screwdriver, rather than having to take it out (as with some other cordless drivers.) I have never used the storage space in the handle, but i can see how it might be useful. I very much like the auto-lock feature which allows you to use the unit like a standard screwdriver."
5,Awesome tool!,"I've had two of these screwdrivers for twelve years and am only now replacing the batteries. The screwdrivers still work great. They are VERY strong, will screw or unscrew virtually anything, and the batteries last a long time between charges. I once lost one of them for over a year - couldn't imagine what happened to it - and finally found it right where I'd left it - inside an evaporative cooler on the roof of my house. The metal parts - collar and screwdriver bit - were totally rusted, but when I put a freshly charged battery in the unit worked just fine, and does so to this day. Highly recommended."
5,ACDelco Blower Motor Resistor,This is an OEM part so it was a exact replacement. Performs perfectly. Easily replaced by almost anyone.
5,Easy to read and study !!,This is a book with reasobable price cosidering the qualityI will recommend this book for my colleague and members.
1,apalling,"This is probably the worst film I have ever sat through. Completely unfun and cruel. You a sick person to want to buy this. Watch it once maybe yes. Buy it? Sick and not fun. No redeeming context either. The film is its own punishment, if you can get to the cheery pop song at the end."
5,This is the best of the best on this subject matter.,"Bob Sorge is pastoral and prophetic in his message about unanswered prayers and suffering. He truly imparts insight, understanding and hope. I highly recommend this book for anyone whose theological underpinnings have been blown out by circumstances. The author guides one out of the minefield of questions such as ""Lord, what is happening in my life? Why is nothing working the way it used to work? Why have You seemingly abandoned me?"" He leads us through the theological crises of several Biblical characters and encourages the soul with this Word of God. A must read for anyone waiting on God..."
4,THIS BOOK IS A BLESSING,"Bob Sorge Fire of Delayed answers was such an awesome blessing. This book is powerful, enlightening, a spiritual revelation that reveals the truth behind the valleys we have to go through in the Christian life. This book fed and quieted my soul. I could not put this book down. A MUST HAVE !!"
1,L'Oral Voluminous Waterproof Mascara,"EPIC CLUMPY SPIDER-LEG LASHESThis product is absolutely wretched. It's dry, it clumps, it looks horrible - like my lashes are made of coal.It doesn't flake or smear, but it's also a nightmare to get off - even with jojoba oil."
2,"Clumpy,messy,hard to work with","Maybe its just me, but this mascara was a mess! the brush was loaded with clumps and made my eyes drag. Didnt like it at all used it three times and that was it into the trash it went."
2,"love he regular, hate the waterproof.","i love the regular version of this mascara, i think it gives you gorgeous lashes and thickens them really well, so i was so excited to try this mascara and i an so disappointed because this mascara, while its not runny at all it flakes like crazy when you go in the water. don't spend your money on this, just get the regular for when you don't want waterproof mascara."
1,worst mascara ever,"I bought this for a special night, went on nicely and looked good before I left the house. Since it was waterproof I felt confident about not checking my makeup (which was the point of buying waterproof. Well, I was mortified when I got back home and I looked like ""the Crow"" I was so embarrassed because I had been talking to people all night long looking like a fool. Then, to add insult to injury, I used eye makeup remover, soap,olive oil and everything I could think of and it would not come off. The black just kept coming off onto washcloths and cotton balls. It was never ending! The skin under my eyes was so raw. FOR 4 DAYS I had raccoon eyes when I woke up and throughout the day. Unbelievable, worst mascara I ever bought."
1,Racoon time!,"Says it's waterproof but smears sooo easily just from wearing it for a couple hours. When you wash your face, you get racoon eyes, then you wipe off with make up remover, then you go to sleep and next morning racoon eyes again! How many times do I have to remove this from my lashes? I don't wanna start rubbing my eyes til they hurt just to get this stuff (that smears) off. I'm returning it."
1,RACOON EYES!,"I agree with the other recent reviews. . . if this ever lived up to it's name, it no longer does. I tried it and wished I had read the reviews. I can't go for more than an hour without cleaning up the circles of smudges under my eyes from this mascara. I DO NOT Recommend it!"
3,The product is good but...,"I love this product. I think it's a great mascara for the price, but I typically buy it at a drug store. This was my first time ordering it online and I have to say I think it might be a little old. It has a chemically or medicinal smell, but it's not overwhelming. I think if I were to order this online again I wouldn't order the waterproof. They tend to go bad faster so I think I would have more luck with a non-waterproof mascara. It still goes on with some effort and it was sealed well so I'm not worried about bacteria. Once it's on it looks great. It's just a little difficult to use because it's slightly dried out. Not clumpy, just drier than it ought to be when you first buy it. I will probably have to replace it in a week or two."
2,I'm disappointed!,"I used to love this mascara, but they must have changed it! The waterproof used to be perfect for me- no smudges under my eyes, but not true anymore. I have to check the mirror all day to make sure that I don't have racoon eyes! And I don't ever rub my eyes- this is from normal daily wear. I have to say I'm disappointed. I'll be going back to Covergirl Lash Blast- it doesn't lengthen as well, but at least it stays where it's supposed to!"
4,Great for the cost,"For the money, this is my preferred mascara. The color is a true black/brown which is desirable for older, or a more natural eyelash coloring, than the harsh black many wear. I always use the waterproof to last through my long days, even on through my evenings, still looking good. I easily clean off residue after shower w/cocoa butter and I don't notice any flaking during the day, so I consider it a pretty much maintenance free product. The brush separates my lashes very well and I'm pleased to not be paying something like $25. for a mascara I need everyday.."
2,Inaccurate,"The Black Warrior river is called merely the ""Warrior"" river (p. 176) and the authors seem to think that Birmingham is the capital of Alabama (p. 178). Also, what do the authors mean when they refer to Dr. Kings ""crucible marches on Montgomery"" (p. 175)?If the inaccuracies and typos on just these three pages are are any indication of the authors scrupulousness, I would approach the rest of the book with a healthy dose of skepticism."
4,Strips away the veneer of myths,"Very good book that explores the reality of Southern history. Predictably, those Southerners who have always bought into the myths of the South and actually believe in its veneer of gentility will react as if personally attacked and by reflex will denounce this clear-eyed approach. Not a perfect book - I would take issue with a few of the suppositions myself - but that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a sweeping review of all the places in the South, it is fun to read, and it reveals the reality behind all the myths. If you love the South and you can think, then this book contains a vast amount of information that you should add to your knowledge of the South. If you are unable to see past cliches and prefer to accept the myths, then this book will no doubt anger you."
2,Get to the analysis,"This DVD is a conversation about Norman Finkelstein. It does not give any detailed analysis of what he writes says pro or con, true or false."
4,Return to My Yesteryear,"This album was released before I was born, but my mom was a big fan of their music (still is). I grew up listening to her play ""Bridge"" and ""Boxer"" on the piano. I was nearly a teenager before I realized they were on the radio too! Others may have recorded ""Bridge"" but I will only ever love the original recording. Listening to this album brings back memories of watching and listening to my mom play the piano, and being at a young age when I still thought she could do everything and the songs she chose were the same. I'm glad to have this CD in my collection!"
3,Abe and Liz,Excellent album. Great music. Starts off soft and then works its way through the pair's best years together of creative genius. Pressing: the sound quality is not amazingly impressive though. Both sides of the vinyl have a muffled 'veil' effect and crackles through out. Had to crank up the volume to get through to a bit more clarity. Wonder again if it has to do with studio sound engineering in 1970? But the music is 'memory lane' material!
2,"About the package, not the album itself","The album it's a classic and it deserves that. I have it in vynil, single CD and in two box-sets (Collected Works, The Collection) and since the DVD is BORING, though the package it's nice, I could live without this 40th aniversary edition."
5,So sad this was the end,"Their last album to me is their finest. Almost all songs are hits (title track, El Condor Pasa, Cecilia, Keep the Customer Satisfied, The Boxer, Bye Bye Love). My favorite: The Only Living Boy In New York."
5,When You're Weary...,"Everything and maybe more has been said about this jewel. It is almost perfect. The only note out of tune is the live version of ""Bye Bye Love"". So, Paul...Art...WHY DID YOU DO THAT??? Without that song your latest album would have been THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE!!! I propose Sony Music to re-re-re-release the album simply by cutting track 10 and so taking off the applauses which ruin the beginning of ""Song For The Asking"". I am sure Paul&Art will not agree with me, but I am as much sure that all Tom&Gerry fans will."
3,Worth the price,It was worth the asking price to get one good tune and a hard copy for keeping. I would buy it again.
5,Outstanding album,"I can't say much more about this outstanding album that others haven't already said. If you heard this album and weren't familiar with the other S&G work, you would think this is a ""best of"" compilation - every song is great. But it isn't a compilation, just a regular album.One thing - as far as I know, it hasn't been remastered, and it really needs to be remastered. The remasters on the new ""Best of S&G"" CD show how much better these tracks would sound if the album was remastered.PS - A remastered edition was released in August 2001, with two bonus tracks. Be sure to get this version."
3,Bridge Over Troubled Water CD,"I had a vinyl album and wanted to replace it with a CD. This CD has stuff on it not on the original that I don't like, and some songs are not the same recording as the original and I don't like them either. I assumed (I should remember what they say about doing that) that the CD was the same as my old album. Ick. However, the seller did a perfect job of filling my order; no complaints there!"
4,Almost one of the best last hurrahs,"As final albums go, it's pretty good, one of the best. Of course I love it, but I really don't think that the quality of the songs is up to Paul's usual standards. Some really great songs here, of course, but Side 2 is a bit weak. Still, a nice finish to their career."
3,"Many decent songs, not many great ones","This CD's worth it--I found there were few songs I couldn't stand. However, I found there were few songs I fell in love with, either, besides the perennially popular (and included in most albums) The Boxer, El Condor Pasa, and Cecelia. Some are pretty catchy, like So Long Frank Lloyd Wright and The Only Living Boy in New York, but most songs have some very good parts and some stale parts/verses. It's a good album to have, because a lot of the songs are unique to this album, and worth listening to. But I'd hardly consider this their masterpiece album."
3,Not my favorite S & G album but has some classics,"All 5 of their studio albums are essential. This is a very good album but my favorite is still their Bookends (a masterpiece). This album is slightly uneven with the classic track ""The Boxer"". The title track (although many consider that their opus) misses the boat with me as it's too over-produced/over-orchestrated although the harmony section in the middle is good. Uneven tracks include a live dull version of ""Bye Bye Love"", ""Baby Driver"", ""Keep the Customer satisfied"" and ""Why don't you write me"" and the irritating ""Cecilia"". The good tracks being ""El Condor Pasa"", ""The only living boy in NY"", ""Song for the asking"" and ""So long Frank Lloyd Wright"".Of course, ""The Boxer"" is worth the price of the album alone. A somewhat disappointing Swan Song since their previous 2 albums were much better (and a better place to start). Never-the-less, still essential for the good tracks alone."
3,Where is the quad version?,This album was also mixed in quad in the 70's. That version should have been included in this anniversary release.
4,Strong album from S&G,"""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" was the biggest success of Simon and Garfunkle's career based upon the massively popular song of the same name and a number of other successful hits. It is also, arguably, the duo's most consistent original studio album. In addition to the title track, ""Cecilia"" and ""The Boxer"" are among their best known songs and ""El Condor Pasa"" also usually shows up on thier Greatest Hits collections. But beyond those highlights, ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" is one of the prettiest songs they ever recorded and other tracks like ""Keep the Customer Satisfied"" and ""Baby Driver"" are solid album cuts. The only real duds are the drearily slow ""So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright"" and a surprisingly unengaging cover of the Everly Brothers' ""Bye Bye Love.""Overall, ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" is good enough to deservedly be called a classic."
4,wife in love,My wife was very happy to get this cd/dvd. she enjoys the oldies and attended a simon and garfunkle concert just after the release of the album.
3,Soft mastering on the Sundazed pressing?,"This Sundazed version starts off really soft. I had to crank the volume to higher that usual levels to listen. And then as you get to track 2.5, the sound level increases. It's the same for side B. Overall sound is a bit muffled and there was noticeable crackling on the right channel. I was hoping for better clarity as claimed by the manufacturers. But the manufacturers also claim that the sound is true to the original pressing. I've not hear the original 1970 version, so I can't tell if this is how it was meant to sound in the first place. Great songs though."
5,"""I am leaving, I am leaving . . . ""","It was very disappointing to hear that the CBS sales record (which this recording held for almost 30 years) was recently broken by a heavily hyped piece of conveyor-belt pap called Pretty Fly For A White Guy by a group called Offspring. In a few months everybody would have forgotten about Offspring, but Simon and Garfunkel will continue to be rock immortals. With this album S&G went out with a bang. Almost every track is timeless. The only low point is the inclusion of a live version of Bye Bye Love, the only non-original song on the album. It is interesting to note that the cover of the original vinyl version did not include the lyrics to this song (they were added once the copyright hassles were overcome). The high point is the classic The Boxer, five minutes of pure bliss. Put quite simply, you cannot be a serious music fan without this in your collection. It is the defining moment of the age of Aquarius."
5,Classic Albums of 1970: No. 5,"Both the Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel released their final albums in 1970. However, while LET IT BE documented the fragmentation of band members heading in different directions, no such tensions are evident on BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER. The title track is a majestic tour de force and spent six weeks at No. 1 and sold over a million copies. ""Cecelia"" was another million-seller. But my favorite track is the melancholic ""The Boxer."" And just for the sheer joy of the song, ""Baby Driver"" runs a close second--even though I still don't have a clue what the lyrics mean! And they pay homage to one of their biggest influences with a rendition of the Everly Brothers' 1957 hit, ""Bye Bye Love."" Simon & Garfunkel were the most successful duo of the Sixties for a reason: Simon was a superb songwriter and they could sing the hell out of a song. It doesn't get any better than this! ESSENTIAL"
4,Surprisingly moving,"I cried twice. I love all of the actors' performances. I thought the story line was very interesting and moving without being schmaltzy. The ending left me wondering, but I don't want to spoil my question for people who want to see this movie. And anyway, there's no answer -- I think it was intentionally left up in the air. You did a good job directing this movie, Kiefer. I nice change from the ordinary and recommended."
3,"Iridology, the Diagnosis from the Eye","This book could be considerably better helper to the practicioneer, if would concentrate practical operations, but no fuzzy theoretical aspects. Methods of return effect on an iris with the purpose of improving a condition of organs and systems practically are not circumscribed. Besides, the quality of a photo could be best. But, in common, the book is usable."
4,Nancy Drew,My 12-yo daughter loves Nancy Drew. All in all the game is entertaining and even if it was a little easy to complete she'll play it over with her friends. They also like to make fun and laugh at certain aspects of the games that can be really corny. This particular game is a bargin because it comes with a book and my daughter loves to read.
1,PICK YOUR NUMBERS: EAST WAYS TO PLAY THE LOTTERY,I live in Canada ontario like to buy this book but you gueis not shipping internaitnol so i gues i pay for the shipping realy need this book ok
2,Mixed Feelings,"i think Vince Vaughn is a very good actor. even though the remake of Psycho flopped, he was a pretty good Norman Bates. this movie, however wasn't as good as it could have been. the editing was very choppy, and the sound mixing was terrible, i couldn't understand a lot of what was said in the movie, and the cinematography left a LOT to be desired. with all of these things fixed, this movie would have had a lot of potential. Anne Heche is a very good actress, but it was stupid how her and Sheriff had sex and then immediately fell in love. CHEESY! well, very gripping plot, but i really didn't feel much of the suspense because of the film quality and sound. also, some of the music was good for the scenes, it added the suspense and feeling that the sound and camera work took away, but it didn't do it adequately enough. i'd recommend this for people who don't plan on seeing it with a critical eye."
3,you WILL cry!,"Three friends visit Malaysia, then part ways, but one ends up in jail, waiting to be hung for the posession of drugs if the others don't return to do their time and spare his life. From this movie, I am convinced Joaquin Pheonix is the best actor out there. His character is the one whose to be hung and every time you look at his face, you want to cry. It's so real. New surprises keep coming up so it's hard to tell the plot without giving away the movie. A love story emerges in the course of the plot which saves this movie from drowning you in total despair and misery. This movie really puts the fear of death in you."
4,"A terrific story of love, honor and courage!!","Though the movie is slow paced, it is a terrific story. You are never sure what is going to happen next or whether the characters will make the right decisions. In the end you will walk away having felt the importance of friendship, love and honor. Terrific performances by Heche and Vaughn."
3,a decent prison movie,It was alright nothing more. The movie kind of dragged on a little bit. The plot leaves you wondering what is going to happen next. Good all around performances. Sexy tub scene with Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.
4,moral issues 101,"I might add this is a must see for anyone wanting to view compelling issues which demand intense decision making...this is one of those movies.. just when life seems to be finally giving you your days in the sun...WHAM...would you serve time in a third world prison, to save the life of a friend? Would ya? This movie makes the viewer think about moral character; when we are called to act on it, do we make the right decisions..or are we apathetic about caring for others, especially when we participated in causing harm in the first place...does the human spirit continue to compel us to do the right thing? Or are we moral jerks? A great ""thinking"" movie for a change."
2,mediocre at best...,"this film had a great idea behind it, but it just turned out to be a cheesy love story."
2,Boringgg,A story about the most stupid person on the planet. Leave your fiancee to serve a prison term in Malaysia to save the life of someone you knew for a short time. yeah right.
3,This film makes you think,"This is a tense drama that really made me think about my own morals. Heche isn't as bad as I thought she'd be, Phoenix is suitably pitiful, and Vaughn is also good. There are a few twists and turns, and some scenes are riveting."
4,Solid Film,"Return to Paradise is an all around solid film, with fine acting and a suspenseful story line. Although I was disappointed to find out it was not based on a true story (I thought it was), it was nevertheless very entertaining, and it kept me guessing as to what would happen next.Vince Vaughn, Joaquin Phoenix, and Anne Heche all do a fine job of acting in this film. The story is even quite plausible. Fine drama, highly recommended."
5,Wonderful.,"I have two kids and I pick and choose the music that we listen to together. I want them to be up to date but at the same time I do not enjoy a majority of the music that is on the radio these days so I rely on word of mouth to purchase CD's. Andrew Baums music is now a family favorite. It has moved up to the first spot in our CD changer in the car. My 3 year old loves to sing along to music that isn't just for kids and I enjoy listening to music that isn't sung by a purple dinosaur. With the kids or without I really love Andys CD and would urge everyone to give it a try, you won't be sorry."
4,More evidence of Jarvis' genius,"This is a collection of tracks recorded between 1983 and 1992 by the band who later went on to huge success with their poppy albums His 'N' Hers and Different Class. It starts at the front, with things like the squeltchy title track and the critcical hit My Legendary Girlfriend (a seven minute epic). The standard of CD1 isn't far below either of those gem albums by the group. Being Followed Home is a particularly chilling and daring offering, and She's Dead, I Want You and Don't You Want Me Anymore all emrit a mention. CD2, however, is from an age in which their work wasn't of the same standard. Only the humourous Dogs are Everywhere and the crooning My Lighthouse are up to standard. Best way to think of this might be thinking of CD1 as a long awaited new album, a return to a radio-friendly sound after the experimental (but great in its own way) This is Hardcore, and CD2 as a collection of bonus tracks."
3,Thermometer,"This item has been changed by the manufacturer, and not for the better. I have used this model for years in and out of the restaurant business and frequently at home. They have added too many ""bells and whistles"". Why would they put an audible alarm on it? If you can read, you can certainly see what the temperature is. Only amateurs would need an audible alarm. All the extras do is make the unit more confusing and needing to be checked for settings to see what the actual temperature reading is. It works and I will use it, but the same model, older generation, was far better."
1,Unbelievable,"There is actually a DVD edition of this sans MST3K treatment? Amazing, simply amazing. This movie is bad. Not bad in the way that Manos, Hands of Fate is bad, but it's still bad. That's not to say that parental neglect is not wrong, but this movie doesn't really put that across very well. Sure, the ""kid's"" parents are a gambler and a drunk, but none of that adequately explains why the ""boy"" (this guy's got to be at least 28) ends up working for a gang. Indeed, part of the reason, this guy starts doing odd jobs for the gangster is for lack of money, which his dad seems to have quite a lot of (I would think if your pops isn't paying enough attention to you, you could at least hit him up for as much money as possible). And nobody (at least nobody with any dignity) would spew forth the speech this poor ""kid"" does to the judge when he blames his parents for his misfortune (and stupidity)."
4,SOCIAL DRAMA!!!!!,"Interesting social drama about parental neglect. The Alpha DVD is a pretty decent print. It has some problems here and there, but nothing too serious."
4,Not like every other romantic comedy,"This movie is quite funny. It's not like every other romantic comedy. I don't agree that it's like a daytime serial. It's funny when Holly Hunter's character are imagining or fantasizing. The actors are very good, especially Hunter and DeVito. It's a quite charming movie that is at least worth renting."
4,It has hope,I saw this movie and I thought it gave hope to those of us that have passed a similar situation. I think it reflects that in life we need enjoy to its fullest. I enjoyed the entire movie and I even liked the music. This is the kind of movie you want to watch and go out and learn to scuba dive. Buy it if you can. It's a keeper!
3,A Queen Latifah fan.,I was looking for other movies that Queen Latifah was in. A different type of show compared to some of her other movies.Having Holly Hunter and Danny DeVito in it were extra.
4,Living Out Loud,"The DVD was in perfect shape and arrived very quickly in the mail. I wondered if some scenes were shorter than the original movie in the DVD version. However, the story still stands as funny and charming with excellant performances. There's a couple of scenes in the movie that still make me laugh out loud."
4,I thought it was a wonderfully human movie.,"This was a wonderful movie about our need to be talked to or touched. These two people are going through life and it seems as though nothing is working out for them, until someone talked to or touched them. This was a very warm very human movie. It reminded me how a simple hello or a hand shake can make someone's day."
5,An amazing & haunting film about real people,"This extraordinary film is superbly directed & brilliantly acted. Holly Hunter takes us into the heart & soul of a character who is willing to look at herself, life & others with brutal honesty & dazzling clarity. Danny De Vito gives a moving, subtle performance of depth that goes beyond all of his past performances. Queen Lativah is an onscreen presence that is powerful & mesmerizing. The script moves from reality to fantasy & back again with such exquisite pacing that we are inside of the character's hopes & dreams as well as witnessing the actual event. I am eagerly looking forward to the next film by Richard LaGravenese."
5,"Funny, a slice of life for divorcees.","This movie is especially pertinent for someone who's husband has been unfaithful to them. There is both humor and sadness. The main characters are floundering somewhat throughout the movie, but find their way in the end. I found it to be very entertaining. Holly Hunter and Danny DeVito both gave wonderful performances."
2,expected more,"Kind of cliche. Acting was good, just kind of blah. I watched this on a recommendation of a friend to see ""characters""."
1,Eddie Cibrian as a masseur.,"The only reason to see this film is the provocative massage scenes between Holly Hunter and Eddie Cibrian . Eddie Cibrian was a lead actor in the now-gone NBC soap opera, ""Sunset Beach"", and in this film, we certainly gave him a ""third watch""."
3,For beginners,"I've tried them all. The best is still ""American Accent Training"" If you really want to learn how it's done you can start out with Accent America.American Accent Training is a must-have! Do it over and over and it'll help you a lot!"
4,"Cute but size not adjustable, so too small.","Ordered several pieces and all were delivered promptly. I am pleased withthe quality of the products I bought. I have 5 ""Babies"" to buy for. Some ofyour items are too pricey for my wallet but your clearance sales are a luckybreak for me. I will definitely be a repeat customer. Thanks. Mrs.Ellen Byers"
3,Not the greatest,"I'm not too happy with this Cologne because it's a bit too spice like for my liking. My wife doesn't care for it either so just be warned its not a citrus, fruit or sporty smell but it is spicerackish."
5,For my brother,I bought this item for my brother. It is his favorite parfume. He told me that it is not to strong and that women like it.
2,Fades away quickly,Smell is good but it fades away within 15 mins. would not recomend to buy this product.
5,Curve by Liz,"My husband Loves this product and for some reason has not been able to purchase it that easy in the store. He was always able to get it at TJ Max and Marshall's. Feeling his frustration I went on line to Amazon and there it was, so I purchased 2 large one's so he could have it in two of our locations and not run out for awhile. He just loves the scent and many will comment on it which boosts his ego. Ordering from Amazon makes my life a bit easier!"
4,Winning,"Every time i wear this cologne i get women asking me ""is that curve?"" or ""ohh i love that smell come closer!"""
5,"Curve- by Liz Claiborne for men, cologne spray","this is the first time i have used this perfume and it is very nice. the first time i put it on and went to the living room, my sister said that i smelled very good. the perfume is excellent and the price was very good. it also got deliverd on time. 5/5"
4,Great Fragrance,"The fragrance itself is wonderful. I purchased this based on reviews. My husband actually likes it. Most importantly I enjoy this fragrance on him.The shipping was very fast however, I used Amazon Prime and they sent me a used product. The tin it came in was all banged up, the cap was missing and there was some product missing. I opted to keep the product as it was a Valentine's gift. I would have not got a replacement in time. Amazon gave me the shipping costs back plus a few dollars off the product.The product is still functional and smells great."
3,Great cologne.....however!,"I'll keep this short as I do not usually write reviews. This is a massive bottle of cologne for a very good price. My only gripe is the spray head on the bottle does not spray the product out very good. I have purchased hundreds of bottles of Curve over the years and I have never had one that dispensed the cologne this poorly. While it is usable the fact that it does not spray evenly, consistently is a real pain. I hope this is just an isolated incident because I love the smell."
3,Not all molds can be used with sticks!,This lollipop mold does not allow lollipop sticks for all molds (only 4 of 7) molds can be used with sticks.
5,Thanks Amazon,"This is one of my favorite pudding flavors. I use it in recipes and sometimes just eat it plain, but it is nearly impossible to find in local grocery stores. Being able to buy it on Amazon just made my day!"
2,one tree hill,i think its a really good book for fans but im not a really good fan so i dint really get it but its good writing n a good book. but i dint get it since im not a fan
1,I WILL ASK AMAZON TO RETURN THIS.,"THE ONE IN THE PICTURE IS N0T THE ONE I RECIEVED. THE ONE IN THE PICTURE HAS WIDESCREEN AND FULL SCREEN, HAS 5.1 (DOLBY DIGIAL) 2 CHANNEL (DOLBY SURROUND) I WAS GOING TO GIVE THIS AS A PRESENT BUT I HAVE DECIDED TO SEND IT BACK, UNOPENED. I HAVE THE ONE IN THE PICTURE AND I BOUGHT IT THROUGH AMAZON.COM I AM HAPPY WITH IT AND THAT IS THE ONE I WHAT. EVEN THE PICTURE ON THIS NEW ONE IS DIFFERENT.Jerry Nybergjlnyberg@sbcglobal.net"
1,worst Michele phiffer and tony danza movie,"I was curious to see this when it first came out on video a few months ago, I am a constant movie buyer, And I am so glad I didn't buy it, It is trash I think they could've sone more with it, I can't believe michele phiffer did this movie, I guess she was desperate. Desperate times calls for desperate measures, I was so dissapointed in this movie,This is a buyer beware movie Don't but in despearation!"
4,Hollywood Knights,"Hollywood Knights is a funny movie with lots of good music and a little raunchy. It made me laugh from start to finish. Seeing stars like Michelle Pfeiffer, Fran Drescher and Tony Danza when they were just beginning their careers was cool."
3,ok,Happy with the DVD with the exception that we had to turn the volume up very high in order to hear it.
4,Great cars,Beautiful cars and very funny. I own this movie and I've seen it 100's of times and it still makes me laugh. I give it 1 thumb up cause I only have 1 thumb he he.
5,CLASSIC! ONE OF MY FAVORITE COMEDY FILMS,"This is a very funny movie. Robert Wuhl is hilarious as Newbomb Turk a rather mischievous horn dog. ""Tubby's Drive-in"" is where the film centers itself,so there are some mighty fine cars to ogle in this forgotten classic. The DVD transfer id good, I did check this out on a HD channel and it looked incredible."
4,"Good Movie, some early appearances by yesterweeks stars Tony Danza and Fran Drescher.",Good Movie. Something I can watch a couple times without boredom. Love the old cars and the vibe of the movie was set well considering the the movie was made in 1980 and takes place in 1965. Couple things that I would have done differently but I'm just rating the movie from my perspective.
5,This punch does have some wang to it,"This is one of the most immature, childish movies of all time...needless to say I LOVE IT. I hate they feature Tony Danza and Michelle Pfeiffer. Robert Whul and Stewart Pankin (Dudley) stole this movie! If nothing else this movie is worth it for Wuhl's stirring rendition of Volare, truly a classic. If you want to laugh pick this movie up!!!"
5,You want the Big One? I've got the Big One.,"Like most guys, there are a few movies that I know all the lines to, and quote them a lot. This is one of them. I do understand why this movie would not appeal to everyone, but if you like the Caddyshack, Blazing Saddles-types of movies, then this is for you. The best characters are actually the two cops who can't do anything right. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia......"
5,Hollywood Knights - Finally out on DVD,I can't believe it has taken so long for this title to finally appear on DVD or VHS. It is a hilarious look at life in the 50's. It's similar to Happy Days but with a touch of Porky's. I strongly recommend it.
5,Hollywood Knights,"For anyone who loved the 60's, cars and classic music from the era, this is right up your alley."
4,A Reel Wuhlbuster!,"Arliss (The Early Years) is an apt ""subtitle"" forthis teen adventure. Similar to American Graffiti in theme but certainly lighter in tone.RobertWuhl is outstand in the lead role and its' a shame Hollywood hasn't found more work for this talented free style comic and actor. Mighty fine soundtrack and a super Saturday night video to watch with that ""Old Gang"" of yours."
3,American Graffitti look alike,I had seen this movie before and wanted to add it to my video library since it is in the same genre as 'American Graffitti'. I am a big fan of Robert Wuhl and totally enjoyed his portrayal of Newkirk.
2,"I hate to be a party pooper, but...","This movie isn't nearly as funny as I remember it being. I remember watching in on HBO when I was about 12 and thinking it was the best movie ever made, but now that I'm older and wiser, it just isn't that funny. The jokes are crude and they do have their moments, but overall it's pretty lame based on today's standards. I guess there was a reason the studio waited so long to release this movie. My advice, rent it before you buy it."
3,The Hollywood Knights,"I am not a fan Of Tony Danza or Michelle Pfeiffer or Liberal POS annoying voice Fran Drescher, But not being there back then and going through it in this movie with the Cool Hot Rods and Cool Music and Outrageous Antics and the Drive-in makes for one good movie worth watching,A trip down Memory lane."
4,It's no Laurence of Arabia...,"I loved this movie when it was on cable in my high school days in the early 80's so I jumped on the chance to buy it when it finally became available. Well, I was a little disappointed as it didn't seem as funny as I remember (but I also still remembered all the lines). It didn't help that my wife was sitting next to me saying ""this is so stupid!"". It was still a good purchase and I'm sure I will enjoy it again some day with the help of a few beers.If you liked Caddyshack you will probably like this movie."
5,Best Film Since Rocky Horror Picture Show,"Hollywood Knights is one of the best films I've ever seen. It has everything a good film needs romance, comedy, and its serious moments. It also has those, sweet!, muscle cars that all guys love.... if you haven't seen it i sugest you see it so and if you have seen it then get it and if you have it then follow the crowed and DON""T DRINK THE PUNCH!!!!"
3,Hollywood Knights,This was a funny movie! I bought it for my husband who really wanted it. It is one of his favorites
3,HOLLYWOOD NITS,This is not a good movie. The only good parts are when Robert Wuhl is on the screen. Every star I gave it is for him and his antics. The violin/gym scene is a show-stealer!!! I say watch it to see Wuhl work. You'll definitely laff.
1,Broke in a week...,"I dropped this brush after about a week and it broke where the metal band is on the handle of the brush. I have always owned conair brushes, and before this one, I have never had a problem. I attempted to super glue it back together (after all it is only a hairbrush), but I dropped it some time later and it broke again and I lost the metal band, so there was no fixing it after that. I went back to using my old conair brush, even though it has seen better days."
2,tourmaline round brush,"I used to have this brush, and there are many prblems with it. I will list a few so as to make this review as short as possible:-the bristles make your hair staticky-the first time i dropped it, it broke in half along the silver part of handle-it gets easily tangled in hair-when trying to blow dry hair with it, your hair gets frizzy and it doesnt help the drying process at all, unlike most other round brushes.I hope this review will be helpful to anyone wanting to buy this brush.-GymStar<33"
5,darn good brush,"I live in fla. and between the rain and the heat and humidity my hair is really frizzy, but I blow dry my hair with this brush and my hair is wonderful i want to buy a round brush next I love it"
1,"Pretty, and useless","I second the comment above about the fragility of this brush. I have had it a week, during which it worked pretty well on my fine short hair. I dropped it this morning from a height of around 3 feet, and the handle broke off from the head. Very poor quality, won't be buying a Conair brush again."
3,horribly fun!,"God, what an aweful transfer! To be honest, I was just happy to find this movie at all, less on DVD. We've probably seen better compression on YouTube, but given the source, I didn't mind. In fact, I suppose it almost adds to the creepiness of the film, which will always hold a special place in my heart as an indoctrination into the horror genre as a child. If you're reading this review, I can only assume that you have a distant memory of this flick from your childhood. It's still good fun to watch, rest assured - just don't expect some sort of gleaming transfer to wow your socks off."
4,Blast from the past!,"I remembered watching this movie when I was a kid and being scared to death. Found it on here and had to have it on DVD! While not as frightening as it used to be now that I'm 40, it still has a spooky feel to it to save for the windy winter nights. Jack Elam and Dub Taylor are very welcome additions to the cast, but don't have very big parts, I'm sorry to say. John David Carson and Dennis Fimple are great together, although it's kind of hard to picture Fimple as a college student (he was 36 at the time the movie was made). All in all, a fun ride to take down memory lane. If you're into old, cheesy horror classics then don't pass this one up!"
3,"Disappointing, though entertaining...",I was very disappointed in the way this series dealt with the important historical events. There was some war that occurred in the late 19th century between Germany ? and France. The description of this war was about one short paragraph. They do some wiggly camera thing with a map and zoom in and out of some poor quality prints to describe this war. And that is the way this series consistently presents ALL of the wars and battles. It would have been very helpful to have had a historian provide some details and context. This series does not bother with that.It is somewhat entertaining and the costumes and settings were presented well. You won`t learn much but it is somewhat entertaining. ...Oscar
2,Fall of Eagles; A Missed Opportunity,"Intriguing subject which missed the mark, in my judgment. Done on a real budget: no crowd or ceremonial scenes nor other activity not focusing REAL closely on the protagonists. It could have been really wonderful. No wonder it was not picked up by PBS."
2,not up to expectations,Fall of EaglesI was very disappointed in this dvd series. I felt as many others did that they didn't spend nearly as much time with the pivotal events in the lives of these families as they should have. I hated the way they ended things with the Romanovs all we got was a two second flash with gunshots saying they were dead. The entire series ending was Ridiculous! I'm glad I checked this one out of the local library rather than spending the money. I advise anyone else interested in the series to do the same.
2,fall of eagles,"Is this for history buffs or is it romance hung on a skeleton of history? As no references or authorities are quoted I feel it is the latter. Entertaining, but not to be taken seriously. With a real interest in the events ""depicted"" I think I have wasted my money."
1,Fall of Eagles,"The Fall of Eagles is brillantly written and performed. Keeping very honest with the historical record, it brings our heritage to everyone's doorstep. Charles Kay and Gayle Hunnicutt, take us to Russian court of protocol and apathy. Their performances make are poignant and truly believable of a fairytale gone wrong. Patrick Steward is Lenin in all his veracity and passion.Every child learning history, should see all 10 hours and 50 mesmerizing minutes."
3,The events leading to World War One...,"The Hohenzollern, Romanov and Hapsburg imperial families dominated Europe's destiny throughout the 19th Century and set the stage for the disaster which would end up consuming the continent, overthrowing traditional governments and redrawing the map of Europe. This program looks at key events which led to the First World War: Bismarck's machinations, Queen Victoria's relations, The poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas II, the befuddled diplomacy of Wilhelm II and, behind the scenes, the Russian revolutionaries who were plotting to bring about the destruction of the aristocracy.Filmed more as a teleplay with some outdoor scenes, occasional graphic images and sparing use of archival film footage The Fall of Eagles sees many good performances. Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Lenin stands out from amongst the rest of the cast. Definitely worth watching, especially if you like history."
3,Typical 1970's TV Production,"Yes Captain Picard is in this DVD!However Patrick Stewart's role is not as eminent as some other actors from the British stage and screen who are featured in this series. Stewart plays Lenin and portrays the communist leader convincingly.The story is about the three emperors from Germany, Austria-Hungry and Russia (Wilhelm II, Franz Joseph and Nicholas II) before and after the outbreak of World War I.Being a history buff I've already read books about those three men. But if you haven't and enjoy British-style documentaries, then you might enjoy this.However I must note the best movie I've seen on the last Tsar of Russia was ""Nicholas and Alexandra."""
4,Fall of Eagles & the Great War.,A very well done presentation of the 3 prominate monarchy's of the early 2oth Century and their effect on the events that lead up to the Great War. There was a great disconnect between the Royalty of that period and those events that were taking place before their very eyes. Supurb production. Excellent recreation of the period.
2,Sticks were bent,"When I rolled it on a flat surface, it was bumpy! The sticks aren't even straight. I don't know what to say, I think it was the shipping but I'm not happy! I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Good first film,This is a good example how a FIRST time director and producer can produce a funny movie with a budget of $500.00.See the first of a new producer's many future movies.Several instances of very funny moments.VERY HIP.
3,Good but not Great,"This Shop Vac Dust Collection System seems to include just not quite enough fittings to complete even a simple system. Although there are 8, 36"" tubes included, there are only 5 connectors to join them to any other tube or fitting. There are only two 90 Degree fittings and 4 ""T"" Fittings to complete your system. A quick check of the ""Plastic Accessories"" available through an order form enclosed with the kit will bring you to the realization that you will have to spend a lot more to get what you need. The little plastic coupling for example will set you back $2.49 ($3.49 on the Shop Vac Web Site) for each one you need. An extra elbow will set you back $3.49 ( $4.49 on the web site) I suggest everyone plan their system before the purchase and add up what your total expense will be."
2,Not a complete system,I bought this system and installed it in my shop.I found at compleation that there was no way to hook it up to a 2 1/2in vacume unless you use one of the gates as an adaptor. It then becomes a 5 drop system.Shop Vac has cleverly designed the system in a non standard size so you can not use PVC pipe fittings with it and believe me I've tried.I know this system has been around for sometime and can't believe they haven't included a simple adaptor. I have emailed customer service about this and to this date no reply.
1,"NOT 2-1/2"" as Advertised, It's 2""","This system is NOT 2-1/2"" as the product features states; it's 2"". You will need to get theShop-vac 906-87-19 Universal Tool Adapterto connect it to a 2=1/2"" system. I opted to return it and get the parts I needed from Peachtree Woodworking available here on Amazon."
5,Must-have for the preschooler in your life,"These are great DVDs. Easy for kids to understand and follow along. My son has seen increases in his reading after watching these. Not a substitute for spending time with your kids, but useful in keeping them distracted and out of trouble. I try to leave these on while I'm in the next room so I can listen along and familiarize myself with the dialogue and story lines so when I hear it later I know what he's talking about. An excellent introduction to the leapfrog style of teaching."
5,excellent care,"excellent care, were two and one was damaged but that is excellent served my daughters aged 7 and 5 years love him. The problem with damaged DVD I immediately sorted out, I'm so glad I bought them all."
2,"Consider, if you will...","This is a time-travel story, not as skillful as some, but an honest and straightforward attempt at presenting a Christian-acceptable future for the world. The science fiction angle is not stressed, but the story focuses more on the future of Christianity and the attempts of a boy to return to his own time. It's a rather mediocre story, in short; it's entertaining to read once, perhaps, on account of the good action, but not again."
3,Too few information,"This book is for beginners only. It has no information on solfeo, music or technical aspects of learning play guitar. It focuses on teaching in an easy way, exercising hand and fingers but it lacks of any good information on how play a guitar. So if you are a person that hadn't ever play a guitar , this is a book for you , but if know the basis of playing you will be asking for more."
3,A Slight Slip,"There are a couple of wonderful tracks on this one. She Has No Strings is a whirling and tremendously powerful piece and the aptly titled Long Way To GO With No Punch is a truly beautiful piece that could roll and roll for hours without tiring the listener. But somehow the magic of Whatever You Love You Are and Ocean Songs, and even their rawer early effort Horse Stories, has deserted this record. Perhaps there is too much reliance on minimalist techniques of repetition - the music never seems to find those secret and entirely unexpected places that make the aforementioned records unique. They performed a big tour on the back of this one so perhaps there was a tendency to find music that would sound big on stage, thus the subtlety and complexity of arrangements on, say, Whatever You Love You Are has necessarily gone missing. I don't know. I only know that the Dirty Three are one of the very few makers of music in this world who matter and we who love them cannot help but expect much."
3,Good not great.,"This CD is perhaps worth buying for the five or six quality tracks it contains, however I would find it difficult to recommend it, especially if it's your first Walker Bros/Scott Walker album. Go and buy Scott Walkers solo albums 1 through 4, and then maybe think about this if you're a completist. The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, and perhaps Stay With Me Baby and In My Room are the only standout Walker Brothers tracks on this CD, with the only other worthy ones being Scott's solo contributions. The Jaques Brel cover Jackie, Joanna, and Lights of Cincinatti are all spectacular, but the other member's solo tracks will most likely dissapoint when compared to Scott's remarkable talent. Also, it doesn't even contain possibly their biggest hit, Make It Easy on Yourself."
5,Perfect fit!,This camera case is the perfect fit for our Kodak camera. It appears well made and is nice looking.
4,Recommended vampire tale w/ a scientific twist,"Desmond Lacroix isn't a vampire, but he might as well be. Avoodoo curse laid on him by his grandmother has given him all thestandard symptoms. Jennifer Dunne has concocted a fast-paced, involving story with sympathetic and engaging characters. It's a vampire tale with a scientific twist, and should appeal to fans of vampire romances as well as those who like paranormal romances from other niches. My only real quibble was with the end, which seemed to be too abrupt, and in my mind left a few threads hanging.Recommended."
5,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,Icould not be happier with this book. I was in particular looking for pictures of buffalo and this book excels in wonderful photos. It is a good size and the writing is excellent too. I am an artist and it has offered me details of the animals that are hard to find.
5,"This album is Anthony's ""ThankYou"" to his fans .","After a meteoric rise to Australian musical theatre's top ranks, via shows like Guys and Dolls, Les Miserables and the lead in ""Phantom"" Anthony Warlow's first two albums were highly successful. Fans outside Aus may not be aware that in 1992, at the peak of his career, Anthony was stricken with cancer. ""Back in the Swing"" was his way of saying to the fans who had supported him through the ensuing battle,""Hey, I'm OK now. I'm back in the swing!"" Listen carefully to his own particular lyrics in ""This Can't Be Love"". Never was an album more delightedly welcomed, especially as the whole performance completely lived up to the exceptional standard we had come to expect of this very talented artist. A different slant here, honey-smooth renditions of swing era favourites, many of which were originally made popular by Nat King Cole. In my opinion, Anthony does it better!"
5,I wish I could enter 500 stars!!!,"One of the greatest recordings EVER to be produced. This wonderful collection contains irresistable songs that will either tear you apart or put a big grin on your face. Ingeniously put together, this CD is a must for any set of ears. Trust me, you will be listening to his performances over and over again."
3,nice design - cheap materials,"I wanted a form-fitting case for my Q with a flat removable clip so that I could either wear it on my belt or put it in my pocket. This Krussell case fits the bill perfectly. It covers the whole phone (including a clear plastic film for the screen) with correctly located openings for the keyboard, camera, buttons and ports. However, the material is either vinyl or cheap leather. I, for example, managed to rip the stiched leather where the side joins the panel under the keyboard in the process of tugging the tight-fitting case onto the phone."
1,Save Your Money,This CD is as bad as any I've had the misfortune to buy. It's a great ad for try before you buy! The songs don't really sound at all like the original hit recordings. I can't recommend this to anyone who really loved the hit versions but maybe someone without any fond memories of The Platters could enjoy this CD. An example of poor attention to quality can be found at the end of track 2 (Only You): there's a stray note left in (after the fade out).
1,FAKE GROUP,This is another CD by a fake group. They are just terrible. They can't even sing the songs with the proper melody.
5,It Just Works,Did what it was supposed to do: allows me to power my new 24-pin motherboard using my old 20-pin power supply.
1,Very Poor,Bought this to work with a newer motherboard. The board was DOA. Sent it back because I didn't need it.
2,Very weak solar panels,"I really thought that this was exactly what I have been looking for...but it is not. If you are looking for a solar energy source for charging your iPod or newer cellular phone, look somewhere else. I own several Brunton products, and I've never had a problem with them before. Even though the specifications listed claim to be able to charge an iPod, it actually takes TWO or even THREE of these very expensive panels linked together to charge an iPod touch or iPhone. It took two Brunton i6 panels linked together to charge an iPod 3G nano, 80GB video iPod, and my Samsung Instinct - even in direct sunlight. Although this item even lists ""iPod"" specifically in its name, I would have to recommend the Brunton 12-watt or even 26-watt solar panels to do the job. The i6 *may* have enough power to charge some of the much older iPods, such as the 1G and 2G nano, but I do not have any old iPods to test."
4,Charge iPhone with sunshine,"I use this to charge my iPhone. It works. It won't charge the battery while the phone is on but it seems maintain the level. I don't see this as an issue because I use this where there is no cell service, and no power - I'm just using the phone as an iPod at this point. The sun is bright where I am in the west. Mine came without the storage sack and I emailed Brunton. They got back to me quickly and mailed me one. I give it four stars as the instruction book doesn't mention it working with an iPhone I just had to take a chance.It does come with an array of cables: cigarette lighter socket, battery clamps, and various barrel connectors for charging other stuff. I haven't tried any of that at this point.Also note that charging electronics in the hot sun is always tricky. One needs to shade or protect the device somehow so it doesn't get overheated while keeping the panel in the bright sunlight."
3,May not work with other devices.,"I bought this solar charger in the hopes that it would charge other usb devices in addition to my iPod. It doesn't charge the most important one, a Garmin Edge 305 cycling computer. In fact, it drains the battery rather than charging it. Further, Brunton's customer support on this issue was poor. The charger works fine with my 4th-generation iPod, but I'd rather not carry a separate charging system for every device, so I'm now looking for a better option for solar charging."
1,CHRISTMAS PRESENT THAT DIDN'T WORK,ITEM WAS PURCHASED FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. GOOD THING I CHECKED IT OUT BEFORE GIVING IT AS A GIFT. IT DID NOT WORK.. ASKED FOR A REFUND.
3,Not The Best Tunes,"It's sort of allright but I was disappointed by the tune selection from some of these composers. Not being a pianist I can't comment on the full arrangements.3 by Sonny Clark from COOL STRUTTIN' - 1 by Duke Pearson - 1 by Kenny Drew - 1 by Bobby Timmons, the full version of Dat Dere - 2 by Horace Parlan from HEADIN' SOUTH - 4 by Randy Weston - 3 by Andrew Hill and 3 by Herbie NicholsA discography is included."
1,dismal sequel,"The author was trying to cash in on the success of his previous diary. Unfortunately, this ""diary"" is mostly reprints of the writings of others. What little Shirer writes is wrong. For instance, he frequently praises the Soviets for wanting to help the eastern countries get on their feet and have democratic governments. He then condemns the US, UK, and France for hampering these Soviet efforts."
2,I love it!,"I love this watch, it is beautiful and elegant and looks very expensive. I like that it is so light to wear, it hardly feels like I am wearing a watch at all. I highly recommend it."
2,misleading claim,"the watch I ordered said ""diamond accented"" silver-tone bracelet. the tag clearly says ""crystal"". either the add is incorrect or the tag attached is wrong.call a spade a spade!"
5,POP music,Pop Music. I would recommend this product to anyone in the world. Now I just need 20 words and I'm done!
2,80's cd,the quality isn't too great. have a couple of the 3 set that have skips. disappointing but love the songs
5,Fantastic!,Any 80's music lover will be happy to have this collection! The selection is perfect. I just love it.
3,80's Hits,"I wanted a CD to be able to listen to while I drive. There are some great 80's songs on here but they are mixed between some not so great 80's songs. The track list could have been a lot better, however I am not complaining for how cheap it was!"
2,Spud from Idaho,"There is a reason this CD set is cheap! There are a lot of songs, almost the whole 3rd CD that I didn't recognize. I would not buy this one again. I recommend the Essential 80s CDs and I Want My 80s Box. Or if you have money to burn, the TimeLife 80s set. That one is awesome, but very expensive."
4,Not standard 80s... better.,"In reviewing this collection, some people have said things along the lines of ""this isn't the 80s I remember"".Well, the 80s you remember SUCK! The 80s are probably my least favorite decade musically of the past 50/60 years or so, but this collection still managed to find the good songs. No Billy Idol, no Bangles, no Tears For Fears. Thank goodness."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this cd because I was led to believe the song Jungle Boy by Baltimora was on it. I feel deceived and tricked into buying something I did not want. Shame on you!!!!
4,"Like Much Of The 80s, Wretched Excess, But Still Fun","Most of the tracks on the first disc alone warrant purchasing it at the price offered...however, the second two discs could've been whittled-down to a few tracks that could've replaced some of the softer offerings on Disc One and it would've been one monster CD...still, the wheat can be burned from the chaff on one's mp3/I-Pod, I suppose."
3,"I love '80s music, but...","I LOVE '80s music (I grew up in that era), but only about half of the songs on this CD are among my favorites from that era. The other half of the songs, I either tolerated back then or didn't like at all. I've seen better '80s collections. (Also, there should have been more hard rock/heavy metal hits included, as many of those songs were grouped in with the pop hits on many radio stations back then. )"
4,Great CD,I love this cd. There are many different types of eighties. If you feel like a ballad there is one if not you can find something fast. Its has many of the songs you love and some you never really heard but sre still great.
2,It was o.k.,"This book was very scholarly, however I liked the other book better, One God,Three Wives Five Religions. It was much more interesting and very well researched."
3,Interesting.,"This is a long neglected area of Civil War study. Written in 1930 this work draws upon official records, personal narratives and contemporary newspaper accounts. Issues, events and personalities are treated with very good detail. Starting with the negotiations for prisoner exchange Hesseltine traces the development of policies that ultimately resulted in the permanent incarceration of prisoners of war. The author's report is quite balanced. Both sides have quite a bit to be ashamed of."
3,"Funny reissue of a ""Classic"" soundtrack... Why?","I loved Forrest Gump since the first time I saw it in a cinema, even when some people considered it as a ""Soap Box-Opera"" movie. And kept watching it over and over again, every time is on TV. So I got the soundtrack as soon as it was on the record stores, because the 32-Hit selection made it a ""Classic"" almost automatically. However, in 2001 the same soundtrack is reissued as ""34 American Classics On 2 CDs"". This is, those crazy guys in Sony/Columbia Production Dept. decided to add two extra songs, Fleetwood Mac's ""Go Your Own Way"" and Jackson Browne's ""Running On Empty"". However, they never considered to add The Doors' ""Love Her Madly"", even when the song was included in the original movie audio track, as well as other wonderful songs... Why???? I agree with ""fendercustomstrat"": this soundtrack should have been issued as a 3 or 4-CD boxed compilation... The extra bucks for having all those beautiful songs together, would be worth the price!!!"
2,WHAT A SHAME...,"THIS MAY BE A GOOD SOUNDTRACK, BUT WHAT THE HELL..I'VE SEEN THIS FILM A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I NEVER FROGOT THAT SONG WHEN HE WAS RIDING IN THE HELECOPTOR ON THE WAY TO VIETNAM.I COULDNT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SONG AND FORGOT WHO THE ARTIST WAS.SO I SEARCHED ON THE CRAPPY INTERNET.... FOR OVER AN HOUR MY POOR TUSH HURTS, AND I FOUND NOTHING, AND IT'S A CLASSIC SONG!!!!! SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MY BROTHER MIGHT KNOW, SO I SAID TO HIM, REMEMBER FORREST GUMP WHEN HE WAS IN THE HELECOPTOR AND THE SONG WENT ""THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OUTTA HERE"" AND IMMEDIATELY HE SAID JIMI HENDRIX, ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER.... SHAME SHAME WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS SOUNDTRACK NEEDS TO BE SMACKED UPSIDE THE HEAD.. WHO WOULD FORGET JIMI, AND THAT BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC SONG. NOW I KNOW, NO WONDER I COULDNT FIND IT. IT AINT EVEN ON HERE! AFTER ALL THOSE CLIPS I LISTENED TO. WASTE OF TIME, PLUS WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO JIMI FANS."
4,Good but Missing Some Favorites,"I really enjoy this soundtrack, it has a good selection of favorite songs from the 60s and 70s, but I concur with the previous reviewer who noted some great songs featured in the movie are missing. What happened?"
2,CD review,"2 CD set, 1 CD with many scratches, first 2 songs dont play, one of them being best song. Very dissappointed"
2,forest gump,"What a mistake. I heard the Forest Gump Suite and it was pretty. The CD is a compilation of old radio music, My fault, should have paid attention to the listed contents"
1,songs LEFT out!,"there was another doors song in the film that wasn't on EITHER of the two soundtracks! it was ""people are strange"" it was used in the scene with the pool table. this album contains MORE oldies THAN CLASSIC ROCK! classic rock would be the doors,fleetwood mac,etc. this album gets boring fast mostly because well,the movie made some of these songs put in the worst scenes! and this album for one DOES NOT cover every song that was out during the ""era""'s that the movie was set in this album covers the STEROTYPICAL music that you would think that was around in those eras! like for the hippe scenes you got ""sunflowers in your hair"" and then you got the songs that even if you watch the movie they don't seem to go with those scenes! avoid this album if you want REAL classic rock get an isle of wight album!"
3,Doesn't look accurate,"I don't own this soundtrack but I've seen the movie a ton of times. I don't see Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"" on here. It was playing in the scene where Jenny almost committed suicide by standing on a ledge at some hotel. And ""Stoned Love"" wasn't even in the movie. Isn't this supposed to be a soundtrack for a movie, not the ""best hits of...?"""
4,good stuff,this movie was awsome. probably my favorite of all time. the soundtrack is almost as good. i was a little disapointed in the soundtrack though becasue it is missing a few very good songs that were in the movie. all long the watch tower by jimmy hendrix and freebird from lynard skynard. freebird is my favorite song so im mostly disapointed with this compilation becasue it isnt on it.
3,Same Old Favorites,I always love the Mamas and the Papas. Scot McKenzie sang his best on San Francisco...
2,ok,"After a few weeks my case began to turn black/purple. It is no longer a beautiful white case that i ordered. Also, it is difficult to press the power button. I have to press it harder than usual. In summary, I would like to say that I was partially satisfied with my product until it began to turn a weird color."
4,great case but not flawless..,This case has a tight grip around my photon.. which gives me peace of mind to know that it won't fall off or if I drop it... the phone won't shatter. The back side is transparent allow you to see all your icons that are printed on the back. The only down fall to this case is its easy to get dirty due to the shinny white pearl outlining of the phone.
1,OK crackers but they are mostly crumbs,"These have been our healthy crackers for years. As another reviewer said, they used to have three individual plastic trays. Now they are just dumped into a bag inside the box, and most of them are broken. I will not buy these again. If anyone knows a good alternative, please comment!"
4,"Love the crackers, not the new packaging","These crackers are very similar to Ritz, but with half the fat. They used to come packaged in three sleeves. When they arrive, every sleeve still had some broken crackers. They just changed the packaging, no more sleeves. The crackers are all thrown together in one bag, and there are more broken crackers then before. L("
3,Just OK,"I like the natural ingredients in this product and the low fat content. However, the taste and texture are kind of bland in comparison to similar reduced fat rounds. I probably won't buy another case."
3,Crushed Box = Broken Crackers,"First of all, I love these crackers. I am not unhappy with the quality. My complaint is that most of the boxes in this shipment were slightly crushed. Every box I have opened so far has had about 25% broken crackers. I still eat the crumbs but they don't hold the cheese very well ;-) I am not sure I will buy this product in bulk again."
5,"Beautiful book, like work of art","I bought this book for my 3 year old, and she absolutely loves it. It's a great book, because it's easy to read, and doesn't have a lot of text for 3-4 year olds. My daughter loves looking at the pop ups when we read it. It's so different from all the regular pop-ups, because of how much detail is included in this book. We loved this book so much, that we got it as a birthday gift for her friends who are turning 4. They are all into cinderella and princess parties now."
5,Art in a book!,"There are no words to describe how beautiful and awesome this book is. I was bitten by the pop-up bug when I purchased Robert Sabuda's Alice in Wonderland (Matthew's mentor). This book is equally as beautiful and I love that it is not a ""Disney"" princess book. The center page has Cinderella after her transformation in full ballroom attire with real ribbon and she stands about 5 or so inches tall out of the middle of the page. In the final pages you can actually watch the prince's hand place the glass slipper on her foot and pull a tab to watch them ride off in to the sunset. This is an amazing book and anyone the least bit interested in this book should not hesitate to puchase it. I guarantee you'll want to collect all of their books after seeing this work of art!"
4,Cinderella: A pop-Up Fairy Tale,This is a very nice pop-up book to read to a granddaughter of 3. A few of the side pop-ups are difficult to open but overall a nice book.
2,It's Amazing!,This book is so beautiful. Purchased for my two year old daughter I hesitate to leave it in her hands. We absolutelty love the pictures and pop-ups!
5,Beautiful,If you have a princess lover she will not be disappointed with this pop-up book Awsome art with beautiful scenes.
5,Top notch,"Excellent book which my niece loves, great value and top notch pop ups. Would highly recommend as a Birthday or Christmas gift"
5,A wonderful book for girls!,My daughter received this book for her 7th birthday. She loves all the details and can read it over and over again. These pop-ups are amazing! I would highly recommend this book to anyone with a little princess of their own.
5,Beautiful book.,"I ordered this book for a 5 year old, but it is too elaborate for such a young child. Will read it to her, but keep it here. It is absolutely beautiful."
3,Why Are These BLUE?,"I didn't want to spend too much some made in china(probably toxic in some sense) mats, and these are the cheapest mats I can find (the OEM ones for my car cost 100 bucks). Did not have to trim it, in fact its a bit small in the front. I'm a little disappointed after finding out the color is Not ""Clear"" as described, they are see through BLUE Color. My car's original mats are light color, and adding the blue mats there makes it look not so great.They kinda smell, like rubber.***IF YOUR CAR'S INTERIOR IS LIGHT CAMEL COLOR DO NOT GET THESE THEY LOOK REALLY BAD, Works if interior is dark color."
3,Baby blue!,I wish there was a note somewhere stating its real color! This product has a light blue shade to it instead of being true clear.
3,a little cheap,these are very average floor mats. vinyl and not rubber-i doubt if they will last. packaging and delivery time was fine.
2,Mats were smelly!,"These mats were purchased for my mother's car. They were extremely odorous when removed from the shipping box. My mother laid them outside for four days to allow them to air out. Once she placed them in the car the smell did return a bit. But she also found that it was difficult for her to move her foot from the accelerator to the brake due to the raised texture. So, she called the company, was issued a return authorization number and she shipped them off. Cost almost $20.00 to return and of course they only refunded the product cost to me! So, these mats cost me $17.00 and cost my mother almost $20.00 to try them! We won't make that mistake again!"
5,Nice car mats!!,Very good quality. Dont curl up and if you have a grey interior like I do in my new Nissan Rogue they are perfect. Helps me keep my car clean.
4,not all the floor is covered,These do fit on the floor of the vehicle but they are flmsy compared to similar and slide away from the seat. I expected to get a product that would fit securely in the space provided. That's why I wanted floormats for my make and model car. Prompt delivery. They will do till I find what I want.
5,Great!!,Fits my honda Accord 05' Great!!! love them and for the price cant go wrong!! saw the same ones at a local car wash for $40 bucks and laughed!
2,Not what I expected,I did not expect the fragance and grape seed in this product. The fragrance in it cause me to break out. I think they sent me the wrong product because I did not see that ingredient in the product I order. It smells good and it leaves a shine on our skin.
5,Vitamin E for Skin,I have been using this product for about seven months and people saw the difference on my face before I noticed. My skin is very smooth and clear. I like the no wrinkles look. This product is being used by me once in the morning and once at night.
3,L'Oreal lip liners,"I have used this lip liner for years and couldn't find them in the stores any more. I ordered 6 so they will last me forever. I don't know if it is normal, but perhaps these were old since I can't find them, but they have an old smell to them. I won't order this kind of thing again."
3,ProCon,"Pro: The best price for a basic shop air filter. (But, does it move enough air to work?)Con: It's a shop vac without hoses and at a hefty price. Couldn't one just modify a cheap shop vac to do the same thing?"
4,Does a good job for what I need,"I have a scroll saw that kicks out a very fine sawdust - not a lot, but still enough to be a hazard for my lungs. I tried using face masks but they are annoying especially since I use glasses that fogged up. This air filter was the perfect answer for me - I run it right next to my saw while I'm cutting and I can watch all the sawdust get sucked into the filter resulting in totally dust-free air. It's not perfectly quiet but it's a lot quieter than I expected, nowhere near as bad as running a regular dust-vac. I can't even hear it once I put on my headphones and tune into my music. The filter is easy to clean and should last a long time. I'd recommend this to anyone who has needs such as my own."
3,"Works well, but has a smell","The foam filter that works as a coarse filter has a very solvent-like smell that will fill the room when you use it. Washing it seemed to help for a while, but later the smell returned.That said, it does move air pretty well, and at a volume that is reasonable. Would be good for a small shop or to pull air from a work area. If you can get used to the smell, or if it fades."
4,Shop Vac Air cleaner,"I do heavy duty wood carving and craft cutting in a very small space. The Shop vac is great, the best air cleaner that I have found in the 8 years that I have done wood art professionally, for the individual with limited space. It cleans well in a short period of time both small and larger particiles yet takes up little space and it is inexpensive compared to the importance of its task and to the price of other cleaners. I strongly recommend it to both the hobbyist and professional cutter. It protects your health without destorying your budget."
4,Eliminates Fine Particles.,"I have a small shop and little or no ventilation. I use a vacuum system to collect the sawdust but the airborne dust remains an issue.I have seen the suspended box filter systems and home-made box fans with furnace filters attached. I needed something portable with a good filter system.This devise is portable, quiet, and move volumes of air in a very short time. I keep it near my band saw, sander, and router table with excellent results."
5,First Time : Best of Surface,"I LOVE this Cd. It has all of my favorite songs from Surface. You can play it all the way through without skipping a single track. Every song is great, but the highlights for me are HAPPY...THE FIRST TIME...CAN WE SPEND SOME TIME...DON'T WANNA TURN YOU OFF...ALL I WANT IS YOU...CLOSER THAN FRIENDS..I MISSED...& SHOWER WITH ME WITH YOUR LOVE. If you are a true Surface fan or just a fan of good r&b music in general this is a must have for your cd collection! I am very pleased with my purchase and will get alot of listening enjoyment out of this for sure! It was well worth the money!"
4,Provocative study of language,"I read this book years ago when I was really into this area. Very good and thought provoking discussion of ideas and problem we rarely think about, although we use language every day."
1,French Fries not allowed,"It looks to me like if this movie has been done just as a vendication bacause of the French political not involvemnet in recent world affair.This movie looks like a stupid way to talk bad about France.All the situations are built to show how bad French are, and it simply gets annoying and boring"
1,So so.,"I was disappointed in the movie. I had intended to read the book, but if the movie mirrored the book, I wasn't happy with either the humor or the ending."
1,Don't. Just don't.,"I love movies, and I am always open to new genres. I am definitely on the less critical end of the review spectrum.But this movie was so awfully boring that I had to go online and look up the plot as it was still playing on my television screen; I couldn't stand watching anymore of it, and was curious to know what happened at the end of the film.I've never done that for a movie, so that says a lot right there.The only reason I am giving this one star is for the setting. I admire the French atmosphere, and how it was incorporated into the film. Otherwise, this movie wouldn't have received any stars from me.Please do yourself of a favor of NOT watching this movie - it'll be 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back."
2,"Two great actors, one lousy movie.","Le Divorce with Naomi Watts and Kate Hudson was such a disappointment. I love them, they are so talented and cool but in this sourpuss flick, I was less than impressed. There's nothing really wrong or terrible about their performances in Le Divorce, it's the weak and confusing storyline that makes this movie a waste of time. I was hoping for a sweet romantic comedy and what I got was a depressing and hollow look at couples who want what they can't have, same old same old. Watts's character tries to kill herself and Hudson's character is casually sleeping around with a married man. Too many cliches, pointless ending, I just wanted this movie to end. It's a darn shame Le Divorce wasn't spectacular, the previews made this film look so good, never trust the trailer, looks can be deceiving."
2,"Not really a comedy,,,,,,","but kinda sorta interesting.Naomi Watts' french husband walked out on her and their daughter shortly after she found out she's pregnant again. He's found a new love. Kate Hudson is her visitng sister, who finds Paris enchanting.The ex-to-be and his family want everything divided, including a painting that his American wife brought with her from California, which may or may not be worth a fortune. She doesn't even want a divorce; just never to see him again.There's an excellent cast, including Glenn Close and Stockard Channing, but the movie never really jelled for me. Not that it's boring - just didn't hold my attention very well.It's pretty much all about the painting,,,,,,,,"
5,Delightful,"Good performances by a troupe of old (well, middle-aged, anyway) stalwarts. Beautiful clothes and surroundings and even a story with a moral, which was, I think, that you are not at the mercy of those you love."
3,Better than the book.,"I did enjoy this movie more than the book. The book made me cranky because it starts out kind of light hearted and then gets really depressing. For some reason, though, when this is translated to the screen, it works better (for me at least). And I think they gave it a better ending in the movie. I'm not a Naomi Watts fan - I think she tends to play forgettable blonde characters - but she actually provides some depth to her character here. And Kate Hudson is always entertaining."
3,C'est normal,"This movie was big on promise but really didn't live up to it's potential. A little humor would have been nice, just to keep the viewer's attention, but alas, there is none. The only thing they offer to keep the viewer's interest as the characters muddle through a lifeless story is the fantastic scenery of France, and a smattering of the language."
1,How to spend millions in a really bad movie,"I'm not american and i don't know how difficult could be the relations between USA and France, but what I know is: This is the worst picture I ever saw!!!It's a shame to watch excelent actors work on a project with no sense. Maybe the book is good but the movie is stupid. I like romantic movies but this movie sucks.Excuse, I'm angry >("
2,French title didn't help,I found this to be a mostly dull and less-than-entertaining movie with disappointing roles/performances for both featured actresses. Big names don't always make great movies.
3,It's okay,"I'm glad I watched it, but it is not a movie I would watch again. The cast made it good for the one time."
3,divorce French style,"They are just ,oh, so, calm about sexual affairs, where andAmerican husband and an American wife are near driven around the bend?The movie kind of makes fun of the French who never talk about money,but have it so on their minds? The Americans never talk about sex,but in this movie the old diplomat does the young American girlin high quality French style?I thought the movie was really terrible in several ways...Sort of like the Russian cart driver who beats his dead horse,taking the French too task for being decadent is very strange.They actually got revolution all wrong at the end of the 18thcentury and have really never recovered their leadership in culturesince the early 20th? After all California seems to be leadingin both culture and wine these days."
1,Made Glad I'm Not French..,"What a waste of time...I am really upset with myself for spending so much time with so many shallow, self absorbed people...Who have no dreams or ambitions beyond their own materialistic desires...Naomi Watt's character is only one close to having any contact with what really matters in life....Another example of Hollywood's fascination with materialism...."
4,well.....,"this is a horrible movie, yeah. things that would never be said are said, dumb stereotypes abound and the mix of humor and seriousness does not flow at all. Nevertheless, I love it. It's a goofy, girly movie that gets you thinking about how French women wear their scarves of all things. All I'm saying is give it a chance, you might end up laughing."
3,"Unfocused, but worthwhile","Merchant/Ivory drop their period frocks for a moment to engage in this labyrinthine comedy of modern relationship manners and transatlantic differences about a pregnant American girl (Naomi Watts) on the verge of divorcing her no-good Gallic swain. With the aid of her wilder sister (Kate Hudson), who arrives from America on an extended vacation looking for romance and adventure (both of which she finds), she negotiates her way through the problems thrown up by the differences between US and French matrimonial legacy laws in respect of a valuable painting.Somewhat lacking in focus, it is a film of good parts rather than an entire success, and the Merchant/Ivory habit of limning only the upper reaches of bourgeois society is confident but somewhat limiting. Matthew Modine as a semi-psychotic abandoned husband is clearly in need of help."
1,Decadent...and not in a good way.,"Imagine spending over an hour and a half in the company of people who have no redeeming qualities whatsoever.Would you choose to do that?James Ivory, the Director that brought us the wit and charm of ""A Room With a View"" and the powerful drama of ""The Remains of The Day"" now brings us the vacuous and self indulgent characters of ""Le Divorce"".I have never been more bored with any motion picture in my life."
1,Absolutely horrendous!!!,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, bar none. Bad dialogue, bad plot, bad acting. And the continuty person should have been canned. What was with Kate Hudson's hair? Long and curly one minute and the big announcement of an expensive hair cut the next but then after that her hair length and color changed with each scene. Any woman can tell you that bangs will not grow out in one week. I hated this movie, hated it. The only thing that was good is that I bought the DVD at a used book sale for $3 and now I now why it was there. I am giving it to the Salvation Army myself. I don't know what happened to Merchant/Ivory/Prabjala when they were planning this one but they failed miserably."
3,so so romance but matthew modine? UGH!,ok this is a little cute feature nicely filmed in paris. kate hudson and naomi watts are fine and glenn close is very radiantm and sparkling. but matthew modine comes outta nowhere playing a psycho stalking watts. i didn't read the novel nor do i intend to. it's just modine's performance puts a damper here and his standoff scene at the eiffel tower is just awful! bad role in an ok film.
5,Love it! Classic romantic.,"I was intrigued immediately upon seeing this film. The content is not overtly sexual but is mature in delivery with the French culture emanating throughout the background - the scenery, the culture. I love films from overthere and have enjoyed viewing this one several times. I love the scarves."
3,Lovely costumes,"The clothing was beautiful. There were also some good shots of the city and of the food, but the plot was predictable, and the best actors were wasted in cameo roles."
2,Wasted cast,"Get a good cast together, get a Director who has done a few good films, put together a dull storyline with lots of subplots, introduce too many characters in such a short timeframe .... and see if people notice! Le Divorce is all of this. I can't help but feel that an opportunity has been lost with this project. Names like Glenn Close and Stockard Channing have no real prominence in this film, and that is because there wasn't enough time to develop their characters. Maybe when they first signed on for the film, the script was different.Le Divorce tries to introduce too many characters, too many storylines and disguise it in a french setting (maybe they thought viewers would fall for the romantic setting and overlook the crappy storyline).The film makes the french look shallow and sleazy. Unfair!Easily one of the most pointless and silly films of recent times."
2,Lacks the Parisian charm.,"I really wanted to see this movie because I love Paris and the French..but I found myself to be losing interest less than halfway through the movie. The Paris scenery is nice, yes..but the storyline lacked bite. I've seen French movies better than this one. I would rather watch French movies with English subtitles because I get more out of it that way. Kate Hudson is beautiful, but this movie didn't really give her justice. I couldn't believe when I got to the menu and there weren't any extras-not a one!! What a disappointment. Maybe you should rent this, but don't buy it."
1,Horrible!!!,"I purchased this DVD hoping it would be in good quality and I would be able to hear a sound at least, nope I have no audio, everything is in black and white and it looks like a bootleg copy! I will never again purchase or look at any products sold by this seller ever again!!!"
1,horrible,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. What were Naomi Watts, Sam Waterston, Glenn Close, etc. thinking? (I've left off Kate Hudson from that list because lately every movie she has made is pretty bad). Is it a comedy or a drama? No one knows. The plot is disjointed, the characters are all repugnant and I wish I hadn't kept watching hoping that it would get better. No one is likable in this film and the storylines don't make sense. I really don't get it."
2,Unfocused,"The film didn't know whether it wanted to be a soap-opera drama (e.g., ""Fatal Attraction""), a broad comedy poking fun at cultural stereotypes (e.g., ""A Fish Called Wanda"") or a celebration of Paris (e.g., ""Amelie""). Instead it was a boring, mishmash, mismatched waste of fine acting and wonderful scenery. And burn that painting!"
1,NOT a romantic comedy,"The trailers make LE DIVORCE look like a romantic comedy. They are dishonest. It is a drama, sort of. Not edgy. But creepy.The characters are worthless. So there's no one to care about, no one to root for. The only ""villain,"" if there is one, is social and legal problems in France. Dialogue is smarmy. There are no laughs at all.And to make it work for America, the movie tacks on and ends (never mind the silly coda) with a VERTIGO scene, or maybe it's the belltower scene from BATMAN.Fine actors like Bebe Neuwirth and Sam Waterston are utterly wasted. As was my two hours. SECRET LIVES OF DENTISTS is superb. See that."
1,Ugh,"I was looking for a ""funny romp though Europe"" flick, so I rented Le Divorce.I was let down, to say the least.The script was dull, the actors flat, and all in all, even the shots of beautiful Roma were uninspired.I don't recommend wasting your money on this one."
3,Comedy or tragedy?,"The movie begins with a cheerful French tune and Kate Hudson happily entering Paris. Throughout the movie, the use of colors is bright, the costumes are cheery, and the music is adorable. However, the plot is almost depressing, with a woman who is slighted, a child going to be born without a father, and another woman who is little more than a toy to another man. It particularily disturbed me to see the American man who was basically stalking Roxy. You keep waiting to laugh because of the tones of the set, the costumes, the music, but it only gets more and more sad. All in all, as long as you do not expect a light comedy, the film is worth seeing. The actors/actresses in the movie did a great job."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I skimmed through the 84 reviews here at Amazon and most people are of the same opinion as me. I only saw one review with 5 stars and he called it a good chick flick. Not! It's a boring film and I'm so happy I didn't shell out money for this sorry film. I checked it out of the library for free but I am sorry I wasted my time watching it when I could have been doing other things. I was disappointed in the Kate Hudson character. She was just too quick to fall in bed with men, first with the man that worked for the Glenn Close character and secondly the man who was a relative of her sister's husband. She saw him on a news program and decided she wanted to have a fling with him. Don't waste your money or your time. I wish I could give it a less than one star rating like a minus but 1 star is the lowest I can give."
3,Poor Advertising -- Complete Mischaracterization,"This film, promoted as a romantic comedy, was much more of a drama than a light-hearted romp through France. As a drama, it was okay -- nothing to write home about -- but for those who expected a lot of laughs, you can definitely see why they were let down. A handful of films have fallen victim to this mis-advertising... such as Shallow Hal, The Cable Guy and The Banger Sisters, movies promised in previews to to riotously funny, but actually turning out to have more serious themes. It seems Hollywood would be smarter, after so many years of experience, than to pull the old bait-and-switch scheme on the movie-going public."
2,Le Boring!,"Beautiful ""It"" girls Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts star in a modern day comedy from the masters of the period piece, Merchant Ivory. A formula for success, right? WRONG! Le Divorce is nothing short of a disaster.Hudson plays Isabel, a free-spirited woman who travels to Paris to visit her pregnant half-sister Roxanne, played by Watts. Roxanne is devasted at the news of her husband's affair and debates on whether or not she should file for le divorce.Hudson and Watts are joined by a superb cast which include the long absent and always beautiful Leslie Caron (Gigi), Sam Waterson, Glenn Close, Bebe Neuwirth, and Stockard Channing, to name a few. This delightful cast and the beautiful Paris locations are unfortunately the only redeeming quality in this boring and muddled film. The script is awful, the characters dull, the subplots uninvolving, and the ending extremely clumsy. It's a shame to see such a fine cast wasted. Le Divorce is le pointless. Avoid!"
5,The work of the cross is the gateway for intimacy with God.,"I read this book during a time of great personal crisis. THe Lord used this book to show me how intimacy comes through the cross. The greater the revelation I have of the cross of Christ and the deeper I yield to the power of the blood preapres me to receive a greater impartation of the Holy Spirit. This is not a work of strong will power, but an identification with Christ in the place of the cross. Read this for strength and encouragement in the incredible grace that God releases to us on the basis of Christ's blood in the cross."
4,Really Good Book At A Very Cheap Price,This used textbook was in really great condition when received in the mail. It was almost as if it were brand new instead of already having been used. The book also contained an excellent amount of information based on the subject. Very detailed and informative; all for a very good and cheap price!
1,"not the ""real"" timbuk 3","so how does this guy manage to get on amazon as ""timbuk 3"" when he's totally unrelated to the original pat & barbara k macdonald version of timbuk 3? if this sort of name-filching behavior is permitted, i expect his next album to be as ""led zeppelin"". seriously dude, we all know it's a clever name but please find your own."
3,why cairo?,"So why does everyone compare all these new bands to daft punk. come on. Daft punk is robot rock sampling everyone from Space, Bombers, Gino Soccio (who is amazing), Patrick Cowley, and onward. Even Cassius and Sinclair and Dimitri from where? . The flair disco from the late 90's france was the beginning of the revival but this sound is new. fresh - not daft. I must say that I prefer MSTRKRFT but the larry heard like track Zdarlight is brilliant. Bravo. I'll drop it in milano in april 2008. Kreemy"
3,Needs Emotion,"Its not the album is bad, it just lacks that of what five star albums seem to have. I think the track echos gave the album potential (that's in fact the song that made me buy it...) however the rest of the album does little more than bring it all down. Its tracks arnt bad, in that you want to turn the song off, but their just moot in that you somewhat want to skip the song after a few tracks or having listened to it before. Once again, its not a bad album, but its not a great one either, it earns a solid 3 in my book, moot, not offensive or striking - just sort of emotionless.Favorite Song, Echos."
4,Above average shop light,"3 factors I like about this shop light.* It has the diamond plate chrome sheet metal.* Resi-Tronic Ballast. Start Temperature Is 0 Degrees Fahrenheit.* The ends where the bulbs twist in are all on piece making them more sturdy when installing the bulbs.I now own 4 of these lights, One from my local Ace hardware and 3 from Amazon. My local hardware changed models."
1,Reflectors?,"I did some research on the web before buying a couple of these for putting over my bird cages with T8 Vita-Lites for my birds.I THOUGHT I was buying fixtures with mirror-polished reflectors around the lamps, so they'd put out more light. But when they arrived and I opened one of the boxes ( one of them was actually open when it got here ) I discovered that the silver polished part of the reflectors are on the top outside of these things, which has nothing to do with reflecting more light from the lamps down on my area that I want lit by them!It appears that the gimick here is that they put out 90% more light than an open shop light fixture without any reflector at all, but I thought I was getting mirror polished reflectors on the insides of them.I just spent $57 with shipping, on 2 of these and am disgusted!"
3,Dissapointed,I bought two of these lights and one was DOA. The one that works is fine so far but I'll have to see how long it lasts. They are not heavy duty but rather flimsy. I should have just spent the extra money and bought these:Canarm Lighting 48in. Aluminum Diamond Plate Fluorescent Shop Light EFS848232AL
5,Beautiful...Even In Strings!,"Composer Ludwig Van Beethoven is iconic in the Romantic Era of Classical music and is beloved for his emotive pieces like ""Moonlight Sonata"" or ""Für Elise"" by the piano. Lifescapes has recorded an impeccable CD featuring some of Beethoven's most passionate works that is relaxing and unique in featuring the strings instrumental family.Track Listing:1. Sonata Opus 15, Pathetique2. Variations On ""Ode To Joy"" From ""9th Symphony""3. Quartet Opus 18, No. 4 In C Minor - Allegro (Ma Non Tanto)4. Für Elise5. Theme From 5th Symphony6.

Sonata Opus 27, No. 2 (Moonlight Adagio Sostenuto)"
4,Sturdy and nice looking too,"The shaker looks nice, the plastic lid fits tight, I do wish the metal lid would fit with threads or at least have a groove that is longer, I had the lid come off by accident, you don't need to turn it much to have the lid come off., the holes are large enough for most spices, maybe a little too large for some. It would be nice to be able to get a whole set of them."
2,a collection for collectors only,"This is really only for cd collectors and those who want the few tracks that appear here that aren't readily available on cd elsewhere. The packaging is minimal, there's nothing outstanding about the sound quality, and there does seem to be an odd mix here or there. Still, if you're a cd (and disco) junkie like me, you'll want this."
2,2/3 Filler,"I bought this CD set for the funky grooves like- Just Got Paid. Unfortunately, there are only a few inclusions that are as interesting and fun. Two thirds of the set is silly, tinny- sounding, remix fluff. One disc would have easily covered the interesting parts of this compilation.These days there are some really great remixes of 70s, 80s and 90s music. Most selections on this disc however, sound as if very little time or interest was spent in the recreations.Save your dough. Buy a few of the original albumns (CDs) used or select another variety pack."
3,"Great music, bad qualityDVD.","If Arturo Sandoval is going to be there with his trumpet (or timbales or piano)it is a great show, and this is the case,but bad editing and bad quality of DVD."
4,jam miami,"audio and video quality very good,dvd stopped playing for about 10-15 seconds and continued.I also bought a 2nd copy for a friend and he had the same problem.rest of dvd was ok,over all happy with purchase."

2,Yuck,"I'm a horror fan, and I hated this.Nicholas Brendon, and Jaimie Pressley with a tropical setting and a monster. How it's possible to blow that, for a horror fan, is hard to describe - but this did.Please horror fans, look else where for gore entertainment."
1,horrible product,i bought this product and was very disapointed !!!!!!!!!!! it wouldnt show up on m skin and then it would have to be over done when it shown if it was not over done it would be non visable.and it clogged my pours and gave me a big pimple after it wasnt supposed too it said wont clog your pours so i used it and i have sensitive skin may be if you have different skin in wont but i am never using this product again and i got it for a $ at the dollor store so it is not like i wasted my money.but still for the normal price it is not worth it you can use it if you have normal skin but dont be surprised if you get pimples and it doesnt work.
5,"Ahhhhh, more Style Council!",Gotta love my boys! I'll take any collection of TSC. I have most of them already. This is one band that I NEVER get tired of. Paul and Mick really knew how to make music!
3,dont sell-out,This album does not even come close to comparing to their first album. don't sell out and change ur lyrics because u guys were awesome i gave it 3 stars cuz they didnt get rid of the horns YET so their music is still pretty good i just hope they don't turn out like telegraph and suicide machines cuz their music is a shame now
5,"3 great discs, 1 great price","This ranks up there, in my opinion, with Pure Jazz & Pure Jazz Encore for total goodness. This offers a wide variety of songs for those of us who are just ""discovering"" jazz. Put these in, sit back, and enjoy."
3,as with most variety compilations the sound isnt as sharp and crisp,"It is Ok as background music but like most albums made up of remakes of various artists it doesnt have a clean, sharp sound. I also wasnt thrilled with the renditions of some of my favorite songs..like Summertime. However, for someone just getting into jazz it gives them a variety of sounds and artists to get acquainted with."
5,Boy What A Time Period In Music,Purchased this CD within days of Mr. Pendergrass's demise. Was excited to receive it an immediately placed in my car to play before I arrived home. I was ecstatic. It gave me the same feelings as if I was back in that time again. Just as relevant today as then.
1,UGH.. Dont buy these pants,"THEY WERE HUGE! The waist fit, if my waist was supposed to be up to my chest! Too long, ridiculous. Cant hem them. The inseam is like three feet long. what were they thinking?"
1,Fire Drills in the Middle of the Night or the Kidde i12060 Alarm,"It's so much fun at 3am waking to the sound of 4 smake alarms going off. Where's the fire ? Nada ! Renovation required installation of smoke detectors - in this case Kidde i12060.They randomly go off, currently in the middle of the night for no reason. You wake in a panic to no fire - but which detector set them all off so you can shut it down ? I have no faith in these alarms now, dreading a real fire that may be ignored. As others, the only recourse is to disconnect it from the wall."
1,Alarm sounds randomly,"My problem sounds a little different than the other false alarms described here.I've had three of these for about a year, mixed in with a number of older models. For the last few months an alarm has been sounding for a few seconds, usually in the middle of the night. Long enough to awaken everybody, but not long enough to identify the culprit among the many alarms I have. Finally, I was motivated enough to find the offender. I disconnected all alarms except this model; alarm still sounds. There is no battery-low indication. I had hoped the ""alarm memory"" would show something, but apparently that works only in an interconnected setup, which mine is not.Time to find a different manufacturer or model."
1,smoke detector is a lemon,"3 years ago we added a 2nd floor addition to our vacation home in Maine. As part of the renovation, our electrician was required to install 3 smoke detectors. Unfortunately for us, he installed this brand. 2 of the detectors...no problem. but 1 detector...has been replaced already 2 times because, as other reviews say..it randomly has gone off (and always in the middle of the night) for no reason and the only recourse is to disconnect it from the wall. what a terrible quality product."
2,Far too senstive for near a kitchen,"This is way too sensitive for use anywhere near a kitchen. I have one installed outside the kitchen, and it goes off every time I make toast, saute, or broil. Sometimes just turning on a burner on the stove is enough to set it off.The hush feature is OK, but it will keep going off every five minutes or so as long as you're cooking. Since it's hard-wired to the other smoke detectors, the entire house is filled with screeching on all the false alarms."
1,Terrible product packaging - ships poorly,"Recieved alarm in a ""zip-lock"" baggy. Inside the bag, the alarm had a piece of corrugated cardboard backing and piece of thin red plastic to cover the alarm from dust. The red cover was abraded/torn in two places and the battery compartment was hanging open. Therefore there was little to protect the device from damage. The baggy with the alarm was placed inside an oversized box with inadequate padding as well. They used two strips of AirPlus bagged air pods which were 75% deflated. Thus no real protection... plus the oversized box was crushed and torn open on one corner. There is no way I would install a sensitive instrument into my home, in hopes that it will save my house and life after receiving damage like this.Buy your product elsewhere...."
2,Replaced broken version of the same unit.,"I had recently had the previous version of this unit break. It wouldn't stop beeping even after I'd replaced the batter and then the battery compartment got stuck. I'd only ever replaced the battery twice so I can't say it lasted all that long but I frankly didn't want to have to do any research on viable replacements so I just purchased the same unit. I don't like that these do not have a ""hush"" feature that lets you silence the beeping when the battery is running low and I'm not sure I'd recommend the unit to anyone searching for a real quality detector. I will say as far as replacing the unit went however, it was fairly cheap and easy to replace when I had the problem."
1,False alarms,"This alarm goes off all the time when it shouldn't, It has gone off so much i have had to replace the batteries 4 times in the last 6 weeks. The one time it should have gone off it didn't, my son put a TV dinner in the microwave (which is right next to the alarm) and accidentally set the wrong cook time I smelled something burning went down stairs it was very smokey opened the microwave and a bunch of smoke poured out and the alarm NEVER went off! But chicken nuggets and toast will set the alarm off!"
1,kidde i12060 faulty,Last night my kidde i12060 was going off for no reason like mentioned in other reviews. It took me having to yank it out completely before it would quit alarming. There was no convienient harness to slip off and on. Not recommended.
2,Alarm goes off all the time,I built a home and these things drive me crazy. Everytime someone cooks it goes off and takes a long time to stop. We open doors and fan the alarm but it still goes off. I will try to find a different brand.
1,Random Alarms in Middle of Night,After a few years the detectors are going off (full alarm) for a few seconds multiple times in the night. This wakes me and my baby too. Replaced batteries even though none were chirping. I am replacing them all with a different brand.
2,Bad Battery Doors.,"I started with one to replace my bedroom detector and it looked and worked great. (Got really sick of false alarms on windy days from my old detector). So I purchased 5 more for the rest of the house. 2 out of those 5 had battery doors that would not close. I think they broke something when they jammed those plastic things in there that save the battery until it is put to use. I will still be replacing those two with the same model for consistency, but I would think about a different model if you are looking to replace a house full of them."
1,Need to replace these pieces of junk,"As everyone else mentioned these suck. The last 3 nights now I've been woken up thinking there is a fire somewhere. I replaced all batteries, was good for 1 night and then they started again. I've had to disconnect them so I can sleep and won't be randomly woken up. Why its only at night while I'm sleeping I have no idea. Have lived in my house for 3 years and never had any issues. Extremely annoyed and replacing all of them."
1,FALSE ALARMS LESS THAN 2 WEEKS IN,"Replaced 12 year old AC only smoke detectors with no problems to keep my family safe with additional battery back-up on May 30, 2012. Less than 2 weeks in I was up at 12:47 am for a false alarm and 2:14 for the same. Finally figured out which one was faulty and disconnected it. Returning all 3 detectors and replacing with First Alert. First experience with Kidde and I have been cured from using Kidde products in the future."
2,False alarm issue over time,"These units (5) were installed as part of new construction approximately 24 months ago. They have been serviced (cleaned and new batteries) per Kidde's instructions. They have suddenly begun going off for no apparent reason, usually between 1 and 4 AM. Needless to say, I will replace these with something else ASAP!"
2,Kidde i2060,"This product in and of itself is OK, however, unless you are replacing like with like it is unusable. I needed to replace a different Kidde model that was installed 8 years ago and the base has changed. The ring is now smaller and I could not attach this unit to the same plate and was unable to get a new base plate from seller or other suggested locations."
1,Many nights with no sleep,"I have 6 of these awful detectors in my house. As everyone is saying, they go off in the middle of the night. Why? I don't know, but it seems like it happens when the weather get cold. Quick temperature changes? I now have 4 detectors ripped off the ceiling. DON'T BUY!"
1,2 false alarms in 14 hours,"well, what can I say. They like to go off between the hours of 1am-6am. We had 5 alarms installed 2.5 years ago and we have had 4 false alarms since installation. 2 have been within the last 14 hours. A few of alarms go off (not chirping) for 5 seconds or so and turn of. I'm unable to determine which are malfunctioning but I know it's at least 2. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ALARM"
1,False alarms,"Less than a year ago, I replaced all the smoke detectors in my home with the Kidde i12060. They go off for no reason- we dont smoke, and cooking doesnt set them off. They just go bad. I checked the batteries- they are still good. I am so tired of the false alarms that I am going to replace them all with a different brand. I see that these have good ratings from others, but I just wanted to share my bad experiance so that you are forewarned."
2,won't stop chirping!,"Even after replacing all the 9V batteries in the string, one of the five units would not stop chirping. No answers on internet help sites, but lots of people reported same problem."
1,JUNK Do not waste your money!,"Just as others have complained, our smoke alarms go off every few months ... even with brand new batteries. Each time, they've gone off in the middle of the night, anywhere from 2 am to 4:45 am. Simply removing the battery does not work; we have to disconnect the unit from the wiring. Do not waste your money!BTW ... I gave the rating one star only because Amazon won't allow you to give it zero stars."
1,"Too many false alarms, driving us nuts!","We just bought a brand new home and our builder had installed these as smoke alarms. After 3 weeks of moving in, the alarms started going off for a few seconds at a time. There was no smoke and we weren't even cooking anything at the time. We checked the battery and even replaced them, but still, nothing. The noise is annoying! Gives me headaches! Please avoid these if you can!"
3,FALSE ALARMS,MY SYSTEM IS HARDWIRED AND EVERY FEW MONTHS WE EXPERIENCE A DAY OF HELL WHEN AN ALARM GOES OFF. THE FIRST TIME IT GOES OFF WE CHECK THE HOUSE. WHEN WE FIND ITS A TECHNICAL PROBLEM WE HIT HUSH AND USUALLY CHECK THE BATTERY AND VACCUMM THE UNIT OR SPRAY IT WITH AIR. THEN IT TENDS TO GO OFF AGAIN A FEW MORE TIMES EVERY HOUR OR TWO AND THEN IT JUST STOPS. IF THE SYSTEM WERE SAYING IT WERE A CARBON MONOXIDE ISSUE I WOULD TAKE THIS TO ANOTHER LEVEL AND CHECK SOME OTHER CARBON MONOXIDE DEVICE.
5,Great replacements!,"My home was built with the BRK brand, which started going bad after just 5 years. I'm the second owner, so guess what? No warranty! I did the research and found out the Kidde alarms have great ratings, so called the company to ask a few questions. They were great, easy to contact, and friendly! That sealed the deal for me, so I ordered enough to replace all of the BRK brand. Replacement was really easy as each alarm came with the replacement pigtail. My system is all 3 wire interconnected, so I just shut off the breaker and replaced each harness (about 5 minutes each). Once installed I tested them and they worked perfect. So far I have not had a single false alarm! I really like these a lot and feel safer now."
2,False alarm at 3am--no thanks...,"These were installed in our house when we bought it about 3.5 years ago. We've had several issues with them and the final straw was when the one in our bedroom went off for no reason at 3am a couple weeks ago. It was a very rude awakening. However, it took it a few years to do it, so I'm rating it a 2/5, but it makes me wonder if it ever worked in the first place."
1,Same as the rest - False Alarms! Piece of Garbage,"These alarms are so bad. They have kept me and my 5 children up many nights scared to go to bed at the anticipation of another false alarm - and major adrenaline rush. FYI - don't do what I did and try to smash it down if you did purchase it - it has radioactive material inside the metal chamber. I had 12 of these in my house and high ceilings - please, please don't make the same mistake!"
5,works well.. as expected ...highly recommended,we had brk smoke alarms which were more than 10 years old and we were experiencing too many false alarms especially around 3-4 am. we didn't figure out them ever.I read a ton of good reviews about kiddie as expected this alarm works well. It's been 3-4 weeks we bought them so far zero false alarms. It's little sensitive if you install this one close to kitchen which i think is good.great product ..good service and prize from amazon. did i forget to mention this alarm is so easy to install.
1,Hate these things,False alarm at 3 AM. Next day the other one started going off. Then both. Replaced both batteries and the things will not shut up. Tried to reset them. They ruined our dinner party and I still can't hear out of my one ear since trying to reset while up on a ladder. And now my quiet night at home is over. Absolutely hate them and don't know why electrician installed them. He must have made a bundle. Ripping them out.
1,false alarms - in the middle of the evening,"Not sure why this happens - I don't buy Kidde's claim that it's the power companies making changes to their voltage during the evenings - but my Kidde i12060 false alarms in the middle of the night, sending my sleeping sons into a panic. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather him wake then sleep through an ""alarm"" - even a false alarm. The problem is more the story of the smoke detctpr that cried wolf. Now my family has been conditioned that the alarms mean nothing. thanks Kidde!Date of manufacture 2007 Apr. 24"
1,Kidde Piece of KRAP model I 12060,"Let's cut to the chase: this cheap smoke detector is so bad I would call it a piece of KRAP! Except this thing is so bad it gives KRAP a bad name. Endless false alarms. Read up on over-sensitive smoke detectors. After a week, most versions near a kitchen wind up covered in a plastic bag! That is the only way to silence the constant false alarms.A fine machine unless you happen to want to cook at home.Awful fails to describe this Kidde model. DON'T BUY! DON'T BUY! DON'T BUY!Kidde i12060 Hardwire with Front Load Battery Backup Smoke AlarmOne star is way to generous for this poor performing thing! SHOULD BE MINUS 7 STARS!"
4,Need clarity of your brand? Read this book,"""The Hero and the Outlaw"" provides a structured, intelligent, logical way to firstly categorise brands and then secondly to understand them.The text is readable, sufficiently academic to provide credibility and clarity, while practical enough to provide the basis for understanding brands in all types of businesses.That said, it is not a once-through read, but rather should be seen as a text book to which to refer, to keep own brand on point, as well as to understand the behaviours of brands with whom your company may do business."
1,"Wow, a new archetype!","Amazing... discover some (partial) new knowledge of psychology for the sole purpose of manipulating and profiting from others!While this is standard for advertising types, it would only be fair of Pearson to discuss the other core archtypes at work here: the Crook, the Scam Artist, the Amoral Profiteer. These are real archetypes, that most readers of this book are living. Make money Peason, ok, but face your shadow and dont be part of the human problem; be part of the solution."
1,A bunch of pseudo-intellectual malarchy from brand agency people pretending to be smart,"I bought this book after a girl I worked with gave a presentation on the summary to our strategy team. I later found out she never read the book. Before i found out I bought it, read half and gave it to the local library. It's reads like a college essay, full of big words yet saying nearly nothing. Don't waste your energy. I recommend starting with Marty Neumeier's Brand Gap, Zag and Designful COmpany, and if further interested in brand strategy and storytelling, there's a few gems here on Amazon."
2,NOTE: not organic vegetable concentrate,"I just received an email today from Hero Nutritionals confirming my suspicion that only the fruit portion of the concentrate is organic. The veggie concentrate is NOT organic. That means there's a ""dirty dozen"" veggie in there: the spinach. The wording is a bit misleading on the bottle, and definitely false here on the Amazon.com description. Hero is willing to replace the product for me, so I'm sure Hero Nutritionals is a good company, but not as green as I'd like. (BTW, this supplement was for my now almost 5-yr-old.)"
2,Not an Organic product,I called the manufacturer and in addition to Fruit and Veg concentrates it also has various other chemicals/products such as Gelatin (made from Pork skin). They also confirmed that Amazon description is incorrect. Only the Fruit concentrates are organic. Everything else including all veg are NOT organic.I also spoke with Amazon customer service and they have assured me that they will update the product discription.If anyone has a good recommendation for a whole food based organic supplement for a toddler I would love to hear about it.
2,Tasty but few vitamins,"I was disappointed. This children's multi-vitamin may be delicious but it only contains the Vitamins A, C & E. No other vitamins and no minerals.I need something with a wider spectrum for my children than that. My husband and I feel - with these few nutrients, this is more like a fortified candy."
2,Only order during colder months,"Only order these if you live in a colder state or during the colder months of the year. Amazon does not properly package these gummies. I received my first order and it was completely melted. I contacted Amazon about the order, told them about the packaging issue, they promptly sent me a replacement overnight. The only problem is, they still didn't package it any differently and that one was melted too. I finally gave up and requested a refund. Maybe I'll try again when the weather is cooler."
4,Good for Kids,Every extra good product that could help kids I am all for it. This is one of that product. Good taste and kids enjoy it. Kudos to the manufacturer and sellers for selling it w/ lower price than what I see on the local store counter.
2,Color faded in few months.,Color faded in few months. It was a gift to my Aunt and when I saw ger after few months it was shocking to see the watch color is gone and looked so cheap and bad.
1,Its not working,"I received watch yesterday and its not working. I dont know if it is battery issue but its not working.No use of this watch for me. I dont have time to return it back as I am traveling back to india tomorrow :(Its aweful, wasted my money."
1,Broken lip liner,The lip liner would not turn to bring up the makeup. Was able to use the lip liner twice. Would not purchase this product again.
4,Good resource if you're considering adopting an ex-racer,"This book provides a good overview of what to expect if you should choose to adopt a retired racing greyhound. It also gives advice on how to keep a greyhound healthy. Overall, a good book to read before you make the decision to adopt. A bonus is the beautiful photos!"
5,Stephanie,"I can't believe one of the reviews on this cd that I read. Are you kidding me?....seriously, Luis Fonsi has one of the best voices I have ever heard. I have several of his cds, and just ordered this one, and I enjoy them all very much. I think he has an incredible voice and the music is absolutely wonderful. Usually, when I buy a cd, I only enjoy a few of the songs on the cd, but every song on his cd's are worth listening to, and you can enjoy listening to them all! If you want good music and enjoy romantic music and want to hear a great voice, buy a Luis Fonsi cd. You will NOT be disappointed!"
2,Deceiving add by Amazon,Don't think you are getting 6 eight ounce cans of Lawnboy oil when you purchase this item. If you read the add it's for 6 (part #89932) which is 4 ounce bottles not the 6 eight ounce cans (part #89930) which is pictured in the add so beware.
2,Incomplete information,"Beautifully photographed, but the instructions lacked completeness. I found them lacking"
4,new techiques,I found this book to have a basic introduction to new tools and methods...Beautiful photos....good text
5,Tropical flower arrangement,"A beautiful flower arrangement. Just what I was looking for. Arrived in perfect condition and packaged very well. Took only a few days to receive. Recommend this arrangement if looking for a tropical theme. Very colorful.26"" Tropical Heliconia, Antherium & Bird of Paradise arrangment"
4,Good Maxi-Single,"If you're not familiar with Mazzy Star, they were a 90s modern rock group lead by singer Hope Sandoval (who also wrote most of their material). Sandoval subsequently went solo, and they ended up only recording three CDs as Mazzy Star. This maxi-single CD includes 4 songs:Fade Into You - Really beautiful, atmospheric modern rock song that's been played a million times on TV shows and movies. I really love the song, which is also available on their ""So Tonight That I Might See"" CD.I'm Gonna Bake My Biscuit - Remake of a song written by Minnie McCoy (AKA Memphis Minnie) and recorded by her during the 1920s. I like this song also because it's such an unexpected remake, and it has a great pseudo-blues sound.Under My Car - ok song that was previously unreleased.Bells Ring (Acoustic Version) - The original version is also available on their ""So Tonight That I Might See"" CD. A very pretty song with strings likely to appeal to fans of ""Fade Into You."""
4,I liked the pictures!,Grass Sandals is a great book about friendship and poems. The main character's name is Basho. Basho liked to have tea on his porch every morning under his basho tree. Basho lives in Edo. Basho likes to travel around his country. When Basho is traveling he gets many gifts from his friends. Basho is great for his blue grass sandals (from his friend) and for haikus. This story took place 300 years ago in Japan.I really liked this book because of its illustrations and of how well it is written. I think that this book would be good for people who like books from other countries. I also think parents would enjoy this story too!
4,Radiantly illustrated,"This picture book presents Basho's travels, with a curious focus on the Japanese characters for various words in his haiku; I wished there had been more emphasis on the haiku themselves. But the illustrations are enchanting and evocative, deep and glowing, with a whimsical touch. While this book doesn't have the deep understanding of haiku found inCool Melons - Turn To Frogs!: The Life And Poems Of Issa, it would be a charming supplemental text for grade school units on haiku, poetry, biography, and historical Japan."
1,Cheap Black and White Reprint,"The paperback version Amazon is now selling is a black and white, print on demand copy. I have read the hardback version of the book to children and they were captivated by the illustrations, narrative story and companion haiku, and the Japanese characters. Unfortunately, this cheap reproduction captures none of the magic of the original."
3,Grass Sandals Review,"I found this account of Basho's life, poetry and journeys a bit like a piece of modern art work; not sure exactly what the author was wanting to achieve and it seems it is for the reader (viewer) to interrupt as his / her fancy leads. Even as a juvenile's read it leave much to the imagination."
2,Movie based 5% on true events.,"This movie was 95% fiction. All the shootings never happened,including the Mafia guys and girl friend. About the only thing that was close to real was the nun incident and yet that too,was a bit embellished. Movie makers should do their homework and find other cop stories that need no make-believe script."
5,Silicon Muffin Pan,"Clean up is a breeze, no need to worry about scrubbing a tin muffin pan to get it clean!"
3,Silicone is a great product,They are alot smaller than expected. The quality is good. I use them often. Be aware these muffin pans are very small but I would still recomend them. I love Amazon shopping.
3,Colors don't make the pan.,"It's ok, just not for me. Nothing I would buy again. Silicone is not for me. Give me the tried and true metal and glass bakeware."
1,Rock Masters was the band! not the video!,"I have had this for a while on video from anotherLizzy collector! Also available is Thunder andLightning, Renegade and Chinatown Tour footage!Try Ebay or other video sources. Most of the qualityis good but don't expect perfect picture and sound.If you can find this it's well worth it and thequality on this is very good! So stop buying thosecheap bad ripoff sets being released and just buyfrom another collector. Not even the greatest hitspackage was any big surprise for anyone who collectsThin Lizzy. I would love to see the Dublin 75 videoremasterd! it's out there! I have 2 copies and bothhave problems with sound and quality! It's ridiculous!Maybe one day somebody will release a box set of greatlive footage remastered! How long do we have to wait?"
1,review of the nonrelease,"I've been waiting a couple of years for the USA release of this one, as have so many other Lizzy fans. I even wrote to the company and received the same nonresponse as reviewer MusicDVDfan, below. If the dingleberries who currently own the rights to this material don't want to release it, will they PLEASE SELL THEM TO SOMEBODY WHO WILL? dorks.IF YOU RELEASE IT, THEY WILL BUY."
1,LEXMARK X5470,"I purchased this printer from a dealer that stated the printer was in acceptable condition...But what I found out was the printer was broke and needs repairs..Had I know that, I could have saved my money on purchasing from him and had my old printer fixed.I have used a Lexmark X5470 printer for years and my lexmark starting leaking ink, so I decided to order a new one from Amazon. I received the Lexmark x5470 in satisfactory time....But when I installed it on my PC found out that the printer does not work...The paper feed tray and roller on inside of printer was broken and would not work....This was so a WASTE of money...WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING ANYTHING FROM THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM."
4,great little printer,"I own this printer and it works great for me. I haven't used all the features, yet, but use the fax frequently and it's great. The printer is downstairs and the computers are upstairs and it's always printed with no problem. The one complaint I have is that you cannot refill the ink or get generic cartridges. This is a dirty little trick by Lexmark. The store I bought it at stopped carrying the ink only 1 month after I bought it, but Amazon sells the ""large capacity"" black ink online with free shipping. Would I buy it again? Only if I could use cartridges that I could refill myself. Otherwise it's a great little printer for a student. One ink cartridge will last me about 6 months (for student use). Oh, and don't replace the ink until you notice that the ink is running out on the print out-- otherwise it will seem as if the printer flies through ink!"
1,I'll never know if it works!!!,I purchased this all in one unit at the beginning of May as a birthday gift for my daughter. Upon her opening it yesterday--there was NO USB cable provided with the unit. I checked the listing and it says nothing about a cable not being provided. I then contacted amazon--they say contact the Lexmark company. I did that. Just got an email from them--there is nothing they can do. So--I guess--I'll never know if this dang thing works or not. Well--if I am willing to order and pay for an USB cable from Lexmark---around $32.00--I can find out. So much for this being a good deal!!!!!
2,not good for beginners,"I found the text to be very unclear for inexperienved mechanics. The instructions say things like ""remove the middle and outer cowlings"" without explaining what the cowlings are. The picture associated with the instruction step then just shows a picture of the motor without identifying the part in question.There is some good information about how a 2-stroke motor works and basic concepts behind prop selection."
3,Too broad,"Overall not a bad book, found it to be very general in a few key area; this would be due to such a large range of models covered. Next time I may look at the OEM manual; for a comparission."
5,great book,This book was exactly what I thought it was and was just what I needed to troubleshoot my 84 merc.
1,Junk Unfortunately,"I am having the worst luck finding a shop light in the $10 price ranch that will work properly. I tried Utilitech, Lithonia, and now American Fluorescent. It's like it is the same junk with different names. I bought two, both would not light at first ... I tried different bulbs and I got flickering lights with one and one flickering light with the other ... then the one flickering light stop working all together. I don't know what is going on, but these low cost light fixtures are junk."
4,Good CD.... but a different Druha,"I was very impressed by Czechmate. Listening to it, there is no doubt that by good fortune a great assembly of world class musicians have merged. In listening to New Freedom Bell the music stands very well on its own, but is certainly of new influences and direction. It is as if it is a new Druha. In fact if I were comparing the two and not just rating this CD, I'd have listed one less star for NFB.And just to note, it is sad to realize that more recent departure of both Jiri Meisner and Martin Ledvina will have an even greater impact on the group. Someday I'd love to hear about a reunion of the Czechmate supergroup."
3,Only wish I would have reviewed this game back when I bought it.,I don't remember. much about this game. Back when I got it I gave it 3 stars but now they want me to review it so here I am writing this. I guess if you are still playing games on your xbox this should suffice as a hockey game for you.
3,Stick to 2K6,"After the success of NHL 2K6, i thought 2K7 would be even better, but it isn't.the graphics are worse, the gameplay is worse, the camera angles are bad, and the menu and gameplay stats menu is worse.smaller pics of the players, smaller scoreboard, Ovechkin has Joe Thornton's face, Crosby doesn't look like Crosby, etc.the music is good, but not as good as 2K6.The only cool things are the little things.-Coyotes have the 10th anniversary patch-new Ducks uniforms-rivarly system-fights happen more often then compared to 2K6but other than that, stick to 2K6, i did. it's a better overall game."
2,Nothing but problems,"My husband and I each got a Nokia 3585 last year. We have had nothing but problems with these phones for the past 6 months. Each phone has been sent for service (twice!) for failing to turn on even though the battery had a full charge. Now, the display screen of one of the phones occasionally fails to illuminate, making the screen very difficult to see. I think these phones are very poor quality and are not made to last. You would do better to invest a little more money in a better quality phone."
1,speakerphone 24/7,it sounds like it is on speakerphone mode 24/7 and there is no volume control. it malfunctions now and then. overall a terrible phone.
