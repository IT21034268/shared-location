1,The remote-control function doesn't work.,"Though the DVD/VCR is brand new, the remote control can't work.The seller has no knowledge and ideas on this, though she tried to help me.The Sony Co. says they can fix it, and I need to mail the machine to them. However, I have no confidence on these guys.So now, I have to manually control the DVD/VCR when I want to watch something."
5,Nice player,"I added this to my TiVo system downstream from the tiVo itself. works great, looks great, and is easy enough to operate even for my seven year old.It automatically plays whichever media you install (DCD or VHS). But, when you are done playing a DVD you have to set the video source back to TV manually. Not a big deal."
4,Plain Vanilla,Reliable yet basic DVD / VCR combo. Picture quality is very good. Easy to set up. Don't expect extras like a fancy programmable remote or a HDMI output jack [as found on high end Sony DVD players].
2,The Scarlet Letter.,"The book is okay until Chapter 17: Bias Free Writing.I'm not certain if it's a sermon from the Gospel of Political Correctness, or an excuse for the authors to be scolds. And they have a problem with every form of group affiliation. The Special Olympics gets a slap, too. ""Special"" is now, officially, a hateful word. They suggest you regularly consult with all the different ethnic and social groups to learn what's okay to say.I'm reminded of an astronomy lecture I attended many years ago. The featured speaker was to talk about his career in astronomy. And he did for much of his presentation. But at the end he digressed to talking about his religious convictions, and the speech became an attack on those who held different beliefs. The president of the astronomy association finally had enough and told the man to shut up and leave.Much of the book is informative and I learned a few helpful tricks.But! Guys? Shut up and go away."
5,Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,"Why read that stuffy puritan Milton when you can read Herrick? I am tempted to commit the heresy of saying that Herrick was the greatest English poet between Shakespeare and Pope. Herrick's world is a fantasy Arcadia in which fair (but apparently imaginary) maidens frolic in an elegant manner. He was a goldsmith, a vicar and a poet. He never married."
5,beer,i never knew beer was so influential i really would like to try an anchient beer after watch this. sweet
2,Ehhh,My daughter loved this documentary and insisted that I watch it. I think so many people love it because it is more entertainment and slight of hand than factual. The connections are loose and intended to win over those that are easily amused by the idea that their favorite drink is responsible for our modern world. I'm sure there are very real ideas and causes but one can't help but wonder how many of them are contrived for entertainment and/or a theory not fact. It's not overly entertaining to watch but certainly do if you have time - just don't go quoting it everywhere later. :)
2,Really Corny - but somewhat amusing,"Overall a corny movie, perhaps some truth behind the story, but overall gets old fast - and didn't even finish watching it."
2,Not worth the money,"Both my daughters (3 and 5) wanted this doll so I thought they would spend hours playing with it. They loved it for about 30 minutes and haven't touched it since. Also, Dora is supposed to sing a different song when you change her skirt but she rarely does unless you really push the skirt button down and keep holding it.I recommend you save your money for something else. My girls spent more time with a Dora coloring book."
2,Won't do ballet,My daughter loves to do ballet and wanted this toy soooo badly. Unfortunately shortly after recieving it we could not get it to do the ballet. The pin isn't working. She was soo cute all dressed to do ballet with Dora and it wouldn't work. The look on her face was heartbreaking. Don't waste your money!
2,not a good purchase,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old because she saw this in the store and really cried for it. Like the previous reviews, it is very loud and annoying. Also the ballet skirt would not stay on unless you held it down which is hard to do when the doll is twirling around. My daughter rarely looked at this doll past the first day. I eventually gave it to my neice but my sister brought it back the next day complaining of how loud and annoying it was. I finally took it to Salvation Army."
3,Who's smoking what?,"129.99? I seriously thought this was a typo, seeing as how last Christmas my mother bought this for my daughter on Amazon for 29.99. I'm not sure if I would have even paid that much. If you really feel like you need one, I've seen it on an online auction site starting at five dollars. I can't imagine why anyone would spend over even thirty dollars for this doll. Also, it's very loud and has no volume control."
1,Not in my house,"My 3 year old daughter received the Dress and Dance Dora Doll for Christmas this year. Hate it! It's loud, difficult to hear the spanish she says, and does not recognize the costume change = song change. She still continued to singe the Merengue song regardless of what dress she's wearing.I sent her back."
3,"Fun Toy, but really not worth the $30","This is a fun toy, but rather expensive for what it does. Unlike other members, I did not have any problem changing Dora's dresses and changing her dance routine. The songs Dora sings grate against my nerves after a while, but my girls (ages 2 and 4) love the doll and play with it often. Great toy, would have liked to pay less though."
2,I think we are all deaf!,"This toy is LOUD! And there is no volume control! My daughter got this in place of the growing hair Dora (it broke in the first 12 hours of having it). It is still working - a week later, but I think we have all become deaf. Dora has to stay in the basement due to how loud she is... but even on the 2nd floor of our home, I can still hear her - loud and clear. Fisher-Price needs to add a volume control, or realize our children do not need toys that are this loud."
2,"Clunky, hard to use & a waste of $$","I have a BIG Dora fan in my house & this was one of her first Dora dolls (last year). She played with it for the first day or two...its loud, very mechanical, not very appealing. The toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make Dora dance & terrorize the puppy. The doll only does one dance, regardless of what skirt she has on now. From reading other reviews, if I pushed & held it while she was wearing it she might ballet, but not worth the hassle! Since then, my Dora lover has received various other Dora dolls, so we have a collection that sings, dances, speaks various languages, and the ONLY one she plays with regularly is the Dress Up Adventure Dora - she's more posable, does something other than sing, and you can change her outfits. Perfect for my almost 5 year old."
2,Interesting story but.......,"The romance genre is famous for the divorced/separated wife/girlfriend who keeps a baby secret from a former husband/lover. My instinct is too consider such women selfish even if I do enjoy the story after all it is fiction. This book just confirms my belief such women really are selfish, Laurn after a week coldly (in my opinion) leaves her husband. (Ok lets put that down to the immaturity of youth). Five years later circumstances forces them back together even tho they both still love each other. So considering what Lauren did to Caleb why expect him to make the first move and declare his love- you leave the man after one week, don't tell him he has a son, get back together but its the man who must declare his undying love first and put his heart on the table so you can feel secure that he really loves you? Maybe I am getting old in my mindset but please this format is getting tiresome to read."
5,Ryobi Shop Light for Bandsaw,I have the previous model Ryobi bandsaw and no where could I find the shop light that came with the newer version that I spotted in Home Depot. Naturally no one in HD knew what I was talking about and a google search directed me to Amazon. The light was delivered in 3 days and with some simple adjustment I was able to make it work with my older bandsaw. Now there is light on my work and makes the saw safer to use.
5,An excellent album,"This album is a treat for any jazz fans out there, especially if you're into Coltrane. If you can listen to Giant Steps then Stepping Around the Giant back to back, it's a nice compliment."
3,i use it for class,it's good for class. it helps out with term questions on quizzes. otherwise i don't really use it for other things.
4,Great Music!,"I love this band. The lyrics, the sound, everything. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes rock/alternative music. My absolute favorite song is Callling You.... check it out, it's a great buy."
5,a masterpiece.,"I've been following Blue October for a few years now. Consent to Treatment I thought was a pretty good album, with a few gems, and I expected their new release, History for Sale, to be about the same - generic alt-rock with one or two radio-friendly possible hits. I couldn't have been more wrong.From the first track, this album gripped me. Each song, while unique, adds to the character of the album and builds an intriguing story. From the quiet opening, Ugly Side, to louder, darker sounds in tracks like Razorblade, from elation in the radio hit Calling You back to depression in tracks like Chameleon Boy and Amazing, the album follows an emotional roller coaster to which we all can relate. The album closes with an exceptional acoustic version of Calling You as a hidden track.This album is nothing short of amazing, and I'd recommend it to anyone, whether or not they've heard of this gem of a musical group."
4,Great CD,"I heard about Blue October's song ""Calling You"" on the radio and just loved it so I had to buy the CD. The CD is different than ""Calling You"" and at first I didn't like it, but the more that I listen to it, the more I learn to like it. The lyrics seem to have a lot more depth to them than mainstream artists and there is a wide variety of songs. All considered I would rate it as one of the best CD's I have bought in a long time."
5,The Best Album!,"The most fantastic of all of Blue's albums!Justin (Lead Singer) has written songs that will clench your heart and paint a vivid picture through his words. This band never does anything half way, and it is shown in their work. All albums, videos and concerts (if you are ever lucky enough to attend) are always preformed with every being of their souls and keep you wanting more. It's hard to be a fan of these gentlemen of rock, and once you are - you will be a loyal one for life!"
5,A real band with their own sound and actual talent...,"This is the album that introduced me to Blue October...I personally love most of the songs on this album. Blue October's sound was such a great change from the pre-fab crap of top 40 stations.IMO It's best to buy the album (as opposed to downloading it) because of the ""hidden"" song in the very last track...a plesant acoustic version of Calling You. Though I have to admit when listening to the CD the lapse of dead air is a bit annoying...but the wait is worth it...of course you could just FF ahead...but that would be cheating."
5,By far...THE BEST,"This is by far THE BEST Blue Oct CD ever. I am totally in love with every single track, never skipping a one. It is an even flow of music that I pop in while driving as it takes me away."
5,Chaplin's terrific artistic statement,Limelight is a wonderfully intelligent film that mixes hilarious comedy with sincere tragedy in its look into the life of the artist and performer who is dependent on his or her make-or-break audience. This film started my interest for Charlie Chaplin and I've been a fan of the socially-engaged genius since.
2,"For the best image quality, stick with the previous releases","Warner Bros really blew it with these new Special Edition releases of the Chaplin films. Instead of transferring them to DVD from the original film sources, they merely converted some PAL versions to NTSC. So, while the new Warner's DVDs have better sound than the previous versions released by Image Entertainment, they are also slightly sped up due to the PAL to NTSC conversion. But, worst of all, as The Laser Examiner website noted, ""The picture quality during normal playback is noticeably softer and less defined in texture as well as detail, and the overlaps make the motion fuzzy as well."" So, if you're a visual purist, you're probably better off grabbing the original Image Entertainment DVD releases of the Chaplin films."
5,One of Chaplin's masterpieces,LIMELIGHT is an essential film for anyone who loves Chaplin or the cinema. END
5,Charlie Chaplin - Limelight Movie,This video was in excellent condition and I have watched it numerous times! I would purchase from here again!
4,The Clown and The Ballerina...,"...I like tug at your heart melodramas.This story is like an opera without the mezzo soprano voice. A down and out, alcoholic clown takes in a ""paralyzed"" ballet dancer and inspires her to greatness, while he falls deeper and deeper into failure. A shadow of his former self, Calvero, the great clown performer, is reduced to street performances and passing the hat for money. What will definitely stir the movie viewer is that even in the age difference, the drinking binges, and the apparent class differences, the ballerina, Thereza, wants to marry Calvero and that she ""would do anything"" to make the clown happy. What devotion! You will love Chaplin's flea circus bit and his over the top violin performance with Keaton. Note: although the film was made in the 50's, it has a feel to it like it was done earlier. The movie viewer will enjoy it, nonetheless."
4,Pretty near flawless rumination about the life of an entertainer,"In many ways, with the long flashbacks to old vaudeville routines, this movie is structured in a way that shouldn't work - but it does. There are a few shots that are held too long and would have benefited from cutting away a few seconds earlier. Buster Keaton deserved a little more prominence during the time he is present in the movie. Otherwise, a pretty near flawless rumination about the life of an entertainer."
4,as close to a masterpiece as he came in those last years,"probably the best of chaplins later movies (ive never seen ""countess from hong kong"" but ive never known of anyone who likes it) this movie tells the tale of who charlie might have become had he NOT become charlot: a washed-up has been trying to refind his glory through mentoring a beautiful young dancer, played rather stiffly by claire bloom. the film is touching, that schmaltzy musical score tuga st the heart, buster keaton offers a brilliant cameo, and the music hall routines are a riot. we still miss the little tramp, but this is a fine film in its own right."
2,Chaplin Should Have Remained Silent,"I couldn't disagree with the Lewiston, Idaho, reviewer more when it comes to Charles Chaplin's ""Limelight."" Chaplin's ""philosophy of life"" is enough to make you cringe. It's a shame, really, because it could have been a truly great film. Chaplin was better off keeping his mouth shut and relying on his pantomimic brilliance, which dominate ""Limelight's"" best moments. The Chaplin-Keaton performance remains the film's highlight. A silent Chaplin far outweighs the talky, pretentious bore that he had become in his final films."
1,Chaplin revised,"A pretentious, dull and tedious movie about a vaudeville clown saving a ballerina from suicide. Calvero(Chaplin) goes on and on with self indulgent monoloughes and performs on-stage comedy for two year olds.He even took the opportunity to reduce the great Buster Keaton to a studio intern. Heartbreaking to witness.I regret I saw it..."
5,Outstanding Reference,"I bought ""Pacific NW GPS"" Companion because it was cheaper and covered a wider area...big mistake on my part! This book, although only Washington-specific in scope, is so much more extensive and complete. It lists not only towns and landmarks, as ""PNW GPS C"" does, but also campgrounds, summits, lakes, airports, major highway intersections, and much, much more. ""PNW GPS C"" may suffice for the casual GPS user driving from town to town, but the serious user will want the ""GPS Waypoints"" volumes instead."
3,Good for old school GPS Devices,A good book for finding location with old GPS Devices. The new ones would no longer require a book like this.
4,Must Have for Civil War Researcher,This book is extremely hard to find as it was published in 1961 but a great resource for Civil War research about North Carolina at the end of the war. Most detailed account of Stoneman's raid and the crimes against private individuals until Terrell Garren's The Secret of War.
3,Not quite what I hoped for,"I started off really wanting to like this, because I really liked The White Abacus by Broderick. There were some neat scenes here, but after 100 pages I felt like I was still waiting for the story to engage me. There just wasn't the sense-of-wonder of Broderick's earlier works. I don't think he was pushing himself on this one."
3,new review,It is a translation of the Bible and not a summary of the books in the Bible. It's not any worse than the NLT Bible.
5,If you love rational heroes...,"The primary reason I continue to seek out and read Dick Francis is that he continually creates heroes that are efficacious and rational. He avoids the common pitfalls of most modern writers, and instead invents characters who pass the ultimate test: ""Would I like to meet and know this person?"" If you can answer ""yes"" to that question then there is great potential for enjoyment in the fiction centered around that character. If you answer ""no"" to that question, why even bother reading further?Dick Francis' characters almost always recieve an unreserved ""YES!"" Read ""Enquiry,"" it's not the best from Francis but it's still furlongs beyond the rest."
4,Truth Revealed,"Jockey Kelly Hughes and trainer Dexter Cranfield have their licenses suspended by the Oxford stewards for supposedly throwing a race. Hughes believes that they were framed and he sets out to clear their names and get the licenses restored. Who would want to ruin their careers? As the truth is revealed we hear a story of sexual deviation, blackmail, fixed evidence and attempted murder."
4,A VERY SOLID AND ENJOYABLE BOOK,I have read this book twice and plan to reread it again every couple of years. Martin does a good job with introductory material and capturing the myths in his interpretation. Highly recommended.
4,Very in-depth,This isn't a picture-book. This is mature reading material for a serious mythology enthusiasts. I found the book to be more text-dominated than I expected from the simple flip-through preview.
2,Disappointed Greek Myther,"Very disappointed with this purchase and wont bother reading past the first chapter, as I was expecting a 100% cronological order history of Greek Mythology, without the author's personal spin on the events- this book is not like this. The author puts his own opinion on the events rather that just purely stating what happened, and it is poorly written in my opinion. Will be donating this book to St Vinnies, and looking for a concise, purely factual, cronological account on Greek Mythology for research purposes."
5,Absolutely beautiful music,"We had the fortune of meeting Kate and Richard while they were performing at Excalibur in Vegas a few years ago. Their music was so wonderful that it stopped me dead in my tracks (and while I was heading for some slot machines!). We listened to quite a few songs, spoke to both of them, and I bought their CD from them. Kate and Richard are as sweet as the music they make together."
4,Good,"A good overall look at the SA, with a basic history of the organization and some eye-opening facts and figures (as the history of the SA is traced all the way through 1945 - far from fading into obscurity after the death of Roehm in 1934), with equal time presented to ""Evolution of the SA Uniform"" (which includes insignia), history, and a description of sub-organizations.Would have benefited from full colour treatment of the insignia sections, but that would have taken away from the lovely full colour plates by Volstad.Insignia portions of the text are well done, with physical descriptions accompanied by regulations for such things as long-service chevrons and stripes - good overall look at this very complicated subject. Many details of insignia given, another example are the summaries of collar patches and piping, which describe the abbreviations worn on the patches and which districts they correspond to.Good look at history and organization, with special emphasis placed on uniforms."
4,Splash limited edition #3,"'Splash' is the 42nd single from the Japanese rock band B'z. It was released on the Vermillion Records label and reached #1 on the Oricon charts. The song 'Splash' is taken from the studio album 'Monster'. Of note, the B-side 'MVP' is a non-album track. This is the Limited Edition #3 (blue cover) pressing of the single, which includes a bonus DVD with the video for the song 'Pulse' from the album 'The Circle'. 2 other limited pressings are available, with different videos on the bonus DVD's.Track Listing:1. Splash2. MVPBonus DVD: Pulse"
2,The Case Ruined My CD's,"I had this particular case and after leaving the case in my car part part of the case stuck to my CD's and ruined a few of them. I know you shouldn't leave CD's in a hot car, but I never thought the case would melt onto the CD's."
1,Terrible customer service and technical support,"Unnervingly bad customer service and technical support make this product more than just a waste of money. This product will cost you time and effort. I suggest Palo Alto software's Market Plan Pro and Ad Plan Pro as an alternative.Please, don't suffer what I had to at the hands of these amateurs!"
1,Not very strong,I found Marketing Builder to be a product that was not very reliable or helpful in building my marketing plans. I usually wasted more time with the software then writing. I'd recommend using a different marketing plan software.
5,Excellent Read!,I found the book to be an easy read. I found myself being pulled into the book and identifing with the characters. All of the characters are likable and interesting. I also found myself wanting to get to know the people in the book on a more personal level. I could not put the book down. I am looking forward to the following books from this author.
2,A Parent's Opinion...,"This book is a tough read. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is really information-rich, but many of the research based theories are hard to connect. I am a fairly well educated person in general, but it was a little tough to follow at times.Also, as a parent of a young child recently diagnosed with ASD, this book is difficult to read if someone you love has autism. It mainly focuses on what autistic kids CAN'T do, and doesn't offer much in the way of what treatments the author thinks would address the problem."
1,You can buy this book used for $0.09,"I wouldn't give you a nickel for it. I don't mean to be unkind, but science is so far behind the times with what is really going on."
1,A Little Behind The Times,I thought this book was a stiff and hard to read I don`t this is a good read for a parent.
5,Little Blue Whales a wonderful read,"Ken Lewis knows how to weave a story full of vivid characters, lots of suspense and even allows the reader to see the many sides of sex. Sadly enough, his story has many parallels to reality in small towns when corrupt people gain power. I found this book difficult to put down. An amazing first effort. Thank you Ken."
2,PRETTY GOOD STORY -- VERY BAD EDITING,"Since I live in the area in which the book takes place, I kind of enjoyed the story. Whoever edits for the publisher did a TERRIBLE job! Lots of misspelled/misused words, words capitalized that shouldn't be, bad grammar, etc. I like a mystery so I persevered just knowing that the author had been Chief of Police 28 miles from where I live. Is this book self-published maybe??"
2,Not that funny,"I wanted to rent The Little Rascals movie (1994). This is an older tv show of the same name. It's cute, somewhat funny. I watched it with my 5 year old and she found it confusing. I wasn't a fan of the violence, I doubt much of it would make it onto a kids show nowadays (a guy being pulled over a bed of nails, being electric shocked....) I know it's all in good fun, but I still find it inappropriate for little ones and not very funny either."
1,Cerama Bryte cleaning pads ????,"The shipping was more expensive than the pads. They do not work very well. You are better off using a scraper, then the liquid cleaning polish. Will not order these again."
4,"I'll Probably Buy These, Again","I thought these cleaning pads would work without having to also purchase the silica cream that I had been using. But when it arrived, I read the packaging, and it said that they were to be used WITH the silica cream. I hadn't notice that detail before the purchase. So, I decided to try them out rather than go through the bother of returning them.Unlike some who complained about their scratching to glass top, they worked very well! My wife was very satisfied with the end result.So far, I have used one of the four pads about ten times and it is still holding up fine. I just rinse it out when I am done with it. I used to use paper towels but these wipe away the burned-in stains better than paper towels, and with considerably less pressure.All in all, I am satisfied with these cleaning pads. Not 5-Star because in a pack of four for $5.00, (the Amazon Price) that brings their cost to $1.25 each, but they DO work!"
3,Won't get the really big stuff off.,"These pads are good for the little spots, but way too wimpy to get the burned on sugar off the cooktop. It takes many uses to wear down these spots along with lots of elbow grease. I think I need the scraper tool."
1,poorly made,Purchased this jack the first part of October.came in schedule time. a little over a month after I got it-it started leaking oil. contacted Amazon-nothing they could do- past one month however they did give a partial refund.have email torin two times and no response therefore the one star.couldn't go lower where rating should be
3,"Blood, Guts and Gore","As usual, Edge is chasing a fortune. This time a lost mine places him in a town and fort under attack by Cochise. The women are there to be gruesomely killed or tortured and the Ap[aches delight in various brutalities. Not politically correct, but full of bloody action. An average Edge."
4,Good for before you are an officer,This book is great for those who are planning on becoming an officer and want an inside look at life in the Army as well as being an officer in the many branches. It does a great job of explaining officer customs as well as roles served as an officer throughout the ranks. Not bad for those who are looking to join as an officer or go green-to-gold.
1,A Very Superficial Book,"I returned this book after reading half of it and skimming the other half. I can't find a single original observation to point to, and many of the observations about ""Chinese etiquette"" are really just observations about etiquette in general - such as the universal practice of starting a conversation with small talk.One particularly annoying part of this book is the author's practice of compling long lists of Chinese vocabularly, phrases, place names, and historical references, and then failing to provide the character or ""tone"" marks. As anyone with an even cursory knowledge of China knows, Chinese is a tonal language and, hence, without tone marks a vocabulary item is completely useless to a foreigner. Moreover, the author misspells many of the pinyin transliterations, and often provides phonetic transliterations that are non-standard or inacurrate."
2,Bad presta inflation,"I had problems getting the presta valve head to depress the inner stem so it would take air on my road bike. I messed around with it for a while trying to insert it right and finally gave up and returned it. I ended up buying a Specialized pump with a dual valve head and it works better.The actual build quality of the pump is better than some because the floor plate is metal and the pump doesn't flex when you pump high pressure, but beware of the presta head."
2,Good pump but small gauge increments of 4 PSI is unwelcome,"It's a solid pump with an easy to use valve head. What I have found frustrating is the gauge.The numerical increments are every 20 PSI: 0 / 20/ 40 / 60 / 80 et cetera. That would be fine but the marked increments between numerals is 4 PSI. For example, after ""20"" the tiny hash marks indicate 24, 28, 32, and 36. With the gauge near the bottom of the pump it is nearly impossible to discern the hash marks while pumping.This pump is fine for inflating my bicycle tire to 80 PSI but near impossible to use with my motorcycle tire at 33 PSI. If you have have better than 20/20 vision and use a base-4 numerical system, this is the ideal pump for you!"
2,cheap materials,"as has been noted many times before, this pump has several problems.- the head is large and hard to get a good seal; it may take several tries to before being able to pump- the hose is made of a cheap plastic - it will start cracking right away wherever it bends (near the outlet and where it's stored over the handle), and quickly blows out.don't pay their support company todson half the cost of the pump to get a new hose; get 3/16"" fuel line from your local auto parts store. only costs about two bucks, fits perfectly, and will last a lifetime."
1,broke after 6 months of occasional use,so I'm looking for a new bicycle pump - clearly I won't buythe JoeBlow a second time.
4,pretty good pump for the price,"This is nicely made pump, not too heavy, and comes in a great yellow color. Also nice that it includes a ball needle."
4,Topeak Joe Blow Bike Pump,"Topeak Joe Blow Sport Floor Pump w/Gauge Steel Barrel w Gauge YellowPump of reasonably good quality. The strongest and most unique part of the pump is the Schraeder/Presta valve head. When put on the valve stem of your tire, the head attaches snuggly to both the Schraeder and Presta style valves. An aluminium lever latches the valve head of the pump tightly to the stem and valve - uniquely tight.The pump has a strong construction with a steel base and a padded pump handle. Air gauge is accurate and beefy.Overall, the pump provides a better than average tire filling experience. Topeak has taken all the faults of other competitors and improved on them and have produced a product that will last a very long time with good service."
4,"Good, sturdy and useful","It is a good pump, sturdy, easy to use, versatile for any type of valve and with a precise and easy-to-read meter.It is however big if one is limited on storage place as the foot support is not retractable, but not a major issue."
1,Joe Blow Bicycle Pump Blows My Tires,"Topeak Joe Blow Sport II Floor PumpThis pump is sturdy, beautiful in design and easy to use: when the gauge is working.Three tires have been destroyed. I know how to read my tires manufacturer recommended min 40/max 65 PSI. I always stop between 50-55psi; the average of min/max. But three of my tires have popped during inflation or a minute or two after inflating, but before riding.This can only mean the gauge or gauge dial is faulty, probably not calibrated correctly.I was really excited about this product, but I'm blown away by such a huge defect that, in the end, has cost me about half of the pump's cost, not including shipping."
2,Topeak JoeBlow Sport Bike Pump,"I received this as a gift, and felt it worked okay for my road bike initially. However, from the beginning had a little trouble make proper connection to tire stem. Unfortunately, connection broke within 8-9 months of use. I borrowed another make pump from a friend, which (even though several years old)connected more easily. When it worked initially, no problem with pump mechanism, but connector is just not durable. Reading other lower reviews on this model appear to hold up my own experience."
1,"dumb, dumb, dumb, DUMB!","My four-year old LOVES Angelina Ballerina, so she was really excited to receive this toy as a Christmas gift. We were bummed to discover that this toy was not very usable. First, since the ""ballet floor"" and ""wall"" pieces are that thin plastic-vinyl material, which are folded up in order to form the carrying case/purse .... when unfolded to form the ballet studio scene, they won't lay flat. The walls don't stand up. As soon as you let go the whole thing topples over. Very frustrating for my preschooler. Second, she was devastated to find out that the set doesn't even include an Angelina doll, just Miss Lilly. Apparently Angelina is sold separately. WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
4,Great toy for any little ballet star!,"This is such a great toy for little ballerina's, my sister can't stop playing with it, and watches the dvd's all the time!"
4,Madness?,"This is based on a story by Edgar Allen Poe. I have not read the story. I am familiar with other Poe tales and this has the moody, dark qualities of Poe. Angela Jones is threatening as Morella. The story is photographed well but they do cover a long period of time and the details are hard to follow. Then the story unfolds from flashbacks and journal entries about the cloning experiments. Lisa Blair is good as young Sarah/Morella. Dabbles in incest and whether a soul is passed through cloning."
5,Perfect!,"For anyone who has several kids at home, this is the perfect item for when school starts. It brings 12 erasers and you just can distribute it among your kids instead of buying small separate packs of 2 or 3 per child."
1,Too much sugar can cause you to crash,"I wanted to like it. I fell asleep. Even while reading the poorly written subtitles. Maybe that is the problem with the film... When you hear a character speaking for 30 seconds and yet the subtitle only says ""yes, you're right"" you know you're missing out on something. You simply can't blame the director or script writer for that. Blame the poor translation.That said, I still don't recommend the film:*I don't speak Japanese so I can't say whether the story-line would have been good in spite of the bad translation.*I kept getting the characters confused, because I couldn't look at them long enough to know them because I had to keep reading the dialog. (Don't get me wrong, I usually have no problem following stories with subtitles...)*It was just plain boring."
1,"Cheesy, gross and not sexy","I hated this film. The women in it were not attractive or sexy, and the plot was incredibly stupid and misogynistic. This film is about a Japanese woman who decides to produce her own lesbian porno flick (after working in the straight Japanese porno industry for years with her misogynistic male comrades) and explores her interactions with the actress she hires to star in her porno film. This film had very unsexy and graphic sex scenes and unlikable characters. What's shocking is that this movie was actually produced by a lesbian ...."
1,This is not sweet at all.,"Sugar Sweet??? This film bored me to sleep. Just happy I did not buy it. The film tries to be sexy tries to be well acted and is neither. Just because it is a lesbian movie, did not make it good, and that is from a lesbian reviewer. Why there are few great lesbian films, I have not a clue. If you need to see a great lesbian film go buy A Family Affair, Lianna, Desert Hearts,Aimee and Jaguar, or even The Killing of Sister George(for old classic film value) ...but forget Sugar sweet...it is sour"
1,Mundane,"The story will make you ask, story what story? wait a second there is no real plot here....The acting....I believe that is limited...the alluring sexual content advertised ...was no where to be found...I wanted to like this film, but I just have to be truthful...This is a poorly made lesbian film...simply mundane...Can't someone make an intelligent lesbian film that does not insult our intelligence..."
1,Look Elsewhere,"Sugar Sweet is an ineffective lesbian film. Poor acting, poor dialogue, and an unintelligent script...Makes you long for the days of even Desert Hearts, Lianna, even Personal Best is better.If you need a new flick go see Big Eden(feminem guys but great film) or A Family Affair (lesbian). Sugar sweet is a mistake."
1,Wow?!.......,"This film...it's flaky and trashy. From the preview it looked very intersting so I picked it up, but it's not so please pass this up. The storylines bounce from one to the other which is confusing. Even the interview with the director of the film in the special feature was boring and confusing, I just couldn't hear nor understand what they were saying most of the time."
4,The best we have used,"We use this product because it is effective and does not make our yard so smelly, we cannot enjoy it. It does need to be reapplied more often than they say....we do it once a week or if it rains hard. We have 11 deer that hang out in our neighborhhod and we still have most of our yard. Venison, anyone??"
3,It Works,"We had a herd of land sharks - vertebrate eating machines, attack every plant and tree on the property. The spray stopped them - for a few weeks. You have to frequently reapply the concentrate to protect the plantings for more than about three weeks at a time. I have to spray every plant and flower. They will take the time to find those that you missed. It gets expensive if you have a large area without 8 foot deer fencing, or trained attack dogs that enjoy the taste of venison. Firearms, a more suitable solution, can't be used on the island where we live."
5,"Pleasant smell, effective",I have been using Deer Stopper in rotation with Liquid Fence and it seems to be slightly more consistent and effective (but with deer you are never sure). I also have been using Havahart's Deer stakes with baits from Wireless Deer Fence (no need to change the baits after rain!) This multi-layered defense perimeter seems to have convinced the herds to cross our yard off their list. This summer we have seen hosta blooms for the first time in years and the lillies have gone unmolested.
5,Works on groundhogs too,Makes 3.5 gallons when reconstituted. So far has worked for me- kept deer away over the winter and groundhogs away this spring. Last year they ate everything. Best to apply on emerging plants before the critters can get a taste of them.
1,Did not work,The smell is pleasant but it is not worth the money. The deer still ate all of our plants. :(
5,Homestyle Baking and Cooking,"Recipes are easy and taste delicious, one of the best cookbook series available! Recipes in the most loved are repeats of other cookbooks in the series, but the photos help make choices."
2,"Very Detailed, But Difficult to Read","I bought this book while researching the Logarithmic Spiral. There were only a few references to the Logarithmic Spiral, so it wasn't spot on with what I was looking for. However, I stayed away from this as a source because the text was difficult to read."
3,Cute story,I do not usually read these types of romance stories but I really did enjoy this one. It was refreshing and uplifting!
2,Not her usual,"I usually love Brenda Novak so I hate not being able to give a good review. Although the premise of this book looked interesting, it didn't really play well into the story."
1,CCS Direct,bad service.not give bad service purchase send the product is not.And do not want to take responsibility for their bad serviceCCS Direct very very very bad service
4,Rigoletto,I used to watch this movie as a child. Its still magical as an adult. Its family friendly entertainment that reaches your heart.
5,Looking for the movie.,"My 6th grade daughter's music teacher showed them this movie. She took ""Music Boxes"" to contest and earned the top award. She was so jazzed about the movie that I had to borrow it from a co-worker to watch it. I am now going to buy it for my collection."
5,Takes me back,I grew up renting and watching this movie. It's like a modern beauty and the beast story. I love the singing.
4,Solid independent film,"I find this film well done over-all. This is an independent film so the production quality is not glitzy Hollywood. The actors are not seasoned but their performances are credible and show honesty. The music is very good, much better than most main stream films. The confrontation, beating and later death of the title character and the following epiphany of the involved characters is very well done. This film doesn't do all the work for you, that is, you need to become reflective to get the entire impact of the film. The messages in this film are complex and presented well. These are very important and would serve as a good story to help children of PG age learn. This film is among the better films from the feature films for families catalog and I recommend this as a good family viewing."
4,Great movie,Great movie for the entire family with wonderful music. Decent acting for a low budget movie and good cinematography. I highly recommend it.
5,Rigoletto,"I have had this movie on VHS 3 times.. keep giving it away, this is my third DVD. I plan to give it away, again...sigh My daughter feel in love with this movie when she was a little girl, as did many of her friends.The music is just beautiful. It tells a story that will keep you glued to the Television. I will not give up any of the details.Received on time and in good order. As it is a gift, I will not know the playabily of it until Christmas."
1,Rip-off. MP3 version is CENSORED but not stated in product details!,What the???? I bought the cd a while back and it was good. It wasn't censored. The MP3 version IS censored. If you hate not hearing music the way you heard it then DO NOT PURCHASE THE MP3's. Order a used cd somewhere.
3,"Nice, but not outstanding","While this is definitely a good book, I didn't find any new information in it. If you have purchased any other quilt-as-you-go books in the past, don't bother to buy it. Better to spend your money on some of the other great quilting books available at Amazon, I think. If quilt as you go is new to you, this book is as good as any other, so buy it."
2,Beautiful Quilts as you go,This book wasn't as useful as I had hoped. I found the explanations a bit hard to follow in places.
5,Beautiful quilts as you go,Excellent book. Exactly what I was looking for. Super fast delivery. Thanks.
4,Quilts as you go,Beautiful Quilts As You Go (Golden Threads)looking forward to using the patterns included
4,Not the same,The old unit had a rubber felt under the washer. New one does not. Result some of the blade slip.
4,Beautiful,It feels very light and looks very pretty but is a little overpriced to be honest. It could be a little bit cheaper than for its sold on amazon but I would still buy it again because it feels very light and looks great.
2,Reasonably sharp but poor workmanship,"The knives are reasonably sharp and do their job. However, the construction is disappointly poor. There are large gaps in between the plastic of the handle and the metal bolster. The finish of the handle and blade is also poor. Understandably, this isn't the most expensive set of knives out there, but I wish they would have spent a few more dollars not making them look like such cheap knives."
4,Good Knives,I'm not a knife expert but these knives feel good. I was dissatisfied with my last set (J.A. Henckles) which I bought for double the price because they required a lot of tuning. These knives have been holding their edge longer and the in-block sharpener is very convenient and easy to use. The Consumer Reports review convinced me to buy these in the first place and so far they've been holding up to their praise.
1,Careful of Rust,"I bought this set and they looked great when I got them. Sharp and solid construction.After a couple of weeks of use they all started showing signs of rust. Called the manufacturer and they said it must be my water and the fact that I washed them in the dishwasher. They said, to stop the knifes from rusting I should wash the set by hand only. Even though the product is marked as dishwasher safe, but not with my water supposedly. Then I informed them that one knife, that was never placed in the dishwasher and only washed by hand, wash also rusting. They said it must be the water. I told them I wanted my money refunded or to send me a set that would not rust. They insisted that I return them to the seller. They would not honor the warranty.Funny thing is I bought Chicago Cutlery because I have a set that I have used for 20 years. 10 of those years with the previously mentioned water and dishwasher. And no signs of rust. I wont be buy Chicago Cutlery anymore."
4,Chicago cutlery,"It is very well equipped, but we just gave it to our daughter and son-in-law and they have not used it yet. They loved the idea of a built in sharpener feature. As a matter of fact, they received 2 knife sets for Christmas, but returned the macy's one and kept ours."
4,Chicago Cutlery Insignia2 18-Piece Set /Sharpener is an excellent product,The Chicago Cutlery Insignia2 18-Piece Set /Sharpener is very well made. Sturdy & handsome with a great variety of pieces! Definitely a very good buy.
1,Less than impressed,"I thought that I had done tons of research when I ordered the Chicago Cutlery Insignia2 knife set. I assumed the 4.5 star rating was noteworthy and I didn't think much of the few people that provided a bad rating. I was very excited when the knives arrived but more than disappointed upon opening them. The knives feel cheap like they could bend/break with use and have been made of cheap metal The blades are not smooth as you would expect with a new knife, but instead have notches / ridges (the cheap-o knives form my college days have a smoother blade). Our feeling is that when a knife is brand new it is the be the best it will ever be. I cannot imagine these knives will maintain any degree of sharpness. The set is packaged up and ready to return in the morning."
4,"Solid, feel great in your hand!!","I have ONE complaint, and it has nothing to do with how the knives work or feel, because those are great!!! My Chicago Cutlery insignia popped off and I had to line it up and stick it back on. Which seemed kinda cheap, but the knives work great, and the built-in sharpener is VERY HANDY!"
4,nice kitchen knife set,Set is as advertised. Quick deliver. Good holiday present. It is nice to have the self contained sharpener. Replaced older knife set with this.
4,KNIFE SET,It isn't necessary to spend $400.00 for a good set of knives. This set is very good and I got them at a bargan price on Amazon. I have no complaints on this set.
4,Great Knives - I wish I got the set,"These knives are great, they have a good feel and balance, full tang, and a tapered metal hilt before the handle which provides for an excellent grip. Yes they are the not the amazing grade high carbon alloy of global or wusthof knives but they do stay very sharp and clean excellent. Great Buy, I just wish I had gotten the 18 piece set."
1,Rusted after one week!,"I bought this exact set at a Linens n' Things. After one week of use the knives have developed rust spots. I have attempted to wash and dry them right after use, but the rust just keeps getting worse. The cheap knives I replaced these with never rusted! I'm going to attempt to contact the company tomorrow, but I hardly think it is going to be worth my time to pack up and ship back these terrible knives. Stay clear of this set."
5,"Yes, best non-German made knife set well below German price","I like the forged blade, handle style, the weight, the sharpness ...Frankly, the most I liked is the price point vs. the quality. It is not as refined as those Made in Germany. Its quality also lacks German consistency. I would be greedy if I was looking for all those fine characters for the price I paid. If you are like me, sometimes picky (on fine goods in particular), you will find inperfections on 50+% of the set. A couple of light brushes with the build-in sharpener fixed most but only two, for which I called for warranty service and got replaced. I like how my call was handled and how easy the issue was resolved.I have also bought 'Wusthof 4455 10-Inch Sharpening Steel, Ceramic'Wusthof 4455 10-Inch Sharpening Steel, Ceramicto go along with this wonderful knife set. I am sure it will server me well for a long time. Set expectations at a reasonable level, you will not regret."
5,Great set of useful knifes.,"Just got this set, after having used Chicago Cutlery knifes individually. It's a very nice ensemble of useful knifes. I especially love the Santoku knife, but they are all very well made and 75% sharp out of the box - the built in sharpener (in the knife block) easily fixes that.In regards to how to care for the knifes; they come with clear instructions on how to care for them. If you want problems with them, just don't follow them."
1,Poor quality knives,"My wife and I purchased these knives as a house warming gift to ourselves on the recommendation of a professional chef, and also based on the fact that I also own a set of the Walnut Traditions that I love. We wanted an upgrade to the WT set. That was a big mistake. We do not have a dishwasher, and wash and dry by hand immediately after use. We have experienced the rusting that many other reviewers mention. The worst part is that it is practically impossible to get these knives sharp and get them to hold an edge. Chicago Cutlery's warranty is not near what it once was. In the past, when the tip broke off one of my WT's, I took it back to an ACE Hardware where they promptly handed me a new one! Anyway, we will be donating these and investing in a select few quality knives (Global or equal). I'd rather have fewer knives of higher quality. My advice is to learn what knives you use most, and invest in high quality versatile tools."
5,Perfect Cutlery,These are great knives. I love them and miss them when I cook away from home. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.
4,Cutlery Review,"A fine set for the price, this Block Set would probably be a great addition to 80% of the kitchens in the country.There were a few minor flaws in the finishing process of the knives and the block could have vertical slots instead of the horizontal ones, but all in all, a nice set."
2,Horrible craftsmanship,"I purchased this set of knives during the Cyber Monday Deals Week, primarily due to the high ratings given by users here on Amazon. I had high hopes for this set, but immediately after opening for the first time, I was extremely disappointed. The craftsmanship is simply terrible. The blades had marks and gauges in them, the handles were all scratched up, and several of the blades themselves were clearly not straight. Even the block was poorly constructed. Honestly, my current $35 set is better made, and find it unacceptable for a set that costs over $100. Perhaps I received a set that was returned by another customer and re-sold. Either way, I'm sending it back and am purchasing something else."
2,NOT CHICAGO CULTLERY QUALITY,"ORDERED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CHICAGO CUTLERY BLOCK SET I HAVE HAD FOR ABOUT 7 YEARS, LOOKING FOR MORE STEAK KNIVES; QUALITY IS NO WHERE NEAR THE SAME. THE KNIVES FROM THE ORIGINAL SET ARE IN GREAT CONDITION WITH NO HANDLE ISSUES. NEW KNIVES WEIGH HALF AS MUCH AND BLADE APPEARS VERY THIN.GOOD PRICE FOR PRODUCT IF I HAD NOTHING ELSE TO COMPARE IT TO."
5,Great knives for the price,I bought these knives for my son and decided to try them out before I gave them to him. I ended up buying another set for myself! I was going to buy the more expensive set of wustof knives but decided to buys these instead because they are high quality and less in cost! I especially like the knife sharpening that is included in the block. I love the look of the block also!! I would definately say these are well worth the money!
3,Incredibly Funny!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present and I watched it last night. This movie is so awful, that it's actually funny. It's like a crazy acid trip. A man named Cronin Mitchell becomes horribly disfigured, and gains psychic powers. He soon meets a witch who will make him handsome if he becomes her lover. Everybody else in the world sees the witch as a pretty woman named Ellen. Mitchell is asked by the police to help stop a killer in the streets. If you love bad movies, and killer bed sheets, you'll love SOMETHING WEIRD!!!"
2,Ed Wood - Move over!,"I gave this turkey 2 stars because it made it after 36 years todvd. Being one of the bit actors-stuntmen in this film (I'm the bad actor blonde thug in the bar scene with those awful lines.),I would put it on a level just above ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"".The acting,and cutting left a lot to be desired.I did, however, find one thing that might add some redeemingvalue to ""Something Weird"". I loved the ambulance."
4,Great movie,"I liked this movie but you have to be into this kind of movie to like it. Most people I am sure just do not 'get' it. If you are into strange movies from the 60's then you will like it, if not then you will not understand why anyone watches it. It is a dumb but in a good way and does have a B movie plot. This is the movie(and logo and sound effect) that the Something Weird company ripped their logo etc from. It also has a commentary track which is great to listen to Friedman on. There is a related movie called the Psychic that makes a good pairing to watch together. It is explained in the commentary."
5,B Movie Madness,"This is a classical B Movie, in every sense. It is not for everyone, but it's quirkiness certainly fulfills all the expectations of a B movie afficianado."
2,"Beautiful bracelet, not so beautiful clasp","What a beautiful bracelet! What an ugly clasp! The amethysts are gorgeous, CZ are aparkling, the teardrop shape is very flattering on a wrist. But I could not get over the ugly clasp! One of the teardrop shapes ends short at one end of the braceletand that is where it connects to the other end of the bracelet forming not a very attractive sight. I had to return it, I like everything to be neat, and may be even perfect, too."
5,Excellent Book,"My riding instructors have recommended this book to me and to their other students. It is based on classical riding methods and includes a lot of pictures showing form, both good and bad."
1,vibration came soon,"i have not even got 3000 miles on these and have vibration in the pedal already.would not buy again,not pleased at all"
4,Overall pretty good,"This visor folio is great for carrying cd's on the go. It saves so much space because you don't have to carry around 20 jewel cases. It also is smaller than the cd wallets or bigger cases. The only flaw I found was that it was a little bulky to fit up in the car's visor. If you have less cd's to carry around, I'd suggest the 10 cd visor holder. Other than that this product is great."
5,Quicker than the internet. Puts the pleasure back into browsing,This atlas is fantastic. Intelligent choices of regional maps and scale. The historical maps are an unexpected bonus with world political before and after the two world wars and maps of colonial India and Africa. I find the satellite images a bit overdone but apart from that no space is wasted.
5,I LOVE this mag!!,"I've been looking for a magazine that has a particular aesthetic feel to it.. a little crafty, but not too pastel-looking, graphically organic, but not too 'DIY' feeling. When I visited Australia, I was looking through the book store and found this magazine and grabbed it immediately!! It's a great magazine filled with beautiful simple layout design and great information on Australian/European talent. If I had to compare, Nylon Magazine would be like Urban Outfitters and Frankie Magazine would be like Anthropologie (shopping-wise). I just wish that Frankie Mag would deliver to the states at a lower price. :( But other than that, I'm hooked!!"
2,"I prefer something less dark, like dante's inferno.","I bought this cause a book review segment in Asimov's made it sound good. To be honest it is brilliant, but not to my taste. The graphic violence, explicit sex, & general darkness of the story turned me off. It is well written & well researched, but my tolerance for darkness, death, & depravity is low."
3,Back to basics,Have not got the chance to use it but it help me realize the difference between building with studs and live trees. It stress safety which is always good.
1,A READER,"Please don't buy this book unless you are comfortable reading vague plans and are an experienced carpenter. For all the other ""Weekenders"" like me who appreciate step-by-step instruction with diagrams/pictures, detailed information on techniques for their projects, discussion regarding suitable materials and tips on finishing the project (i.e. painting, etc.) PLEASE choose a book more suited to your skill level. ... I sense impending doom if I attempt to build his cover playhouse which, by the way, seems rather small at only 6'x6'. I think I will join the ranks and order Norm Abrams plans and video as well. DONT BUY THIS BOOK"
2,Great book for a kid with an adult helper,"As a person who lived in a treehouse for 3 years, and was looking for a basic how-to book for a friend, I was disappointed--this is how-to down to how to buy 2x4s and pull nails. Not good for a skilled (or even somewhat skilled) adult, but this book is EXACTLY the sort of thing I would have wanted as a kid: all the basics, lots of advice, and would have been great for a mom- and/or dad-and-me project."
1,"wow, can't believe they are still selling this!",There has been a report about this toy killing a small child.His older brother left this toy out and the toddler ended up swallowing the pieces. the mother didn't even know what had happened. The magnetic pieces were so strong that the pieces stuck the childs beginning and end small of his intestine together. this toy should be taken off the market regardless of the age they put on the box.
1,RECALLED - unsafe for kids under 6,"All Magnetix toys have been voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer, Rose Art, after at least one death and several serious injuries to small children who swallowed the magnetic pieces. Please see the recall notice at the cspc.gov website."
4,fun but beware of the magnet pieces falling out,"My 4 year-old likes it alot. If your child likes to build or make roads or tracks like my little one, he/she will probably love it. We haven't played with it too much yet but already one of the tiny magnets fell out. We're hoping that this won't happen to many of them."
1,Not for gift giving,"I ordered this for a birthday gift. It came in a plastic bag with no retail box. It looks used, even if it isnt. How can I give this for a gift! I think these will be returned. To bad, I do not have time to order on that comes in a box."
3,Disappointed with the packaging,"I bought this for my son's birthday and was very disappointed that it comes in a plastic bag in a brown box. It looks like something you would by from a garage sale. And now I read that it has safety issues. With a 2 year old in the house I am not certain I will be keeping. If I do, I now have to purchase a sturdy container.Would not recommend."
1,Half as much as you think you're getting...,"They advertise it as 30, but no where do they tell you they really only give you 15... they're double-sided... they should tell you that..."
1,will slowly destroy your entire CD collection,Do not use these for long term storage. A gray haze will transfer onto the bottom surface of the CD and you'll never be able to accurately read it again.
3,"Good exercise routines, no nutrition info","Larry Scott's book, ""Loaded Guns"", is more of an exercise routine book (and autobiography). Most of his new exercise routines concentrates on his specific body parts, such as the deltoids, biceps, triceps, and lats. This book is not a complete body-building resource; no nutrition info, and some of the programs are suited for advanced bodybuilders. It also reiterates some concepts already known, such as cardiovascular exercise (aerobics, in other words). All in all, a book for inspiration (for those looking for inspiration)."
3,Good Book,"This book is mainly about Larry's transition from skinny and hardgainer to Mr. Olympia . A good read...some of the pictures and text don't go hand in hand and some of the info does seem dated but otherwise it's a good book to have in any bodybuilding library.There's an interesting 3 minutes aerobic routine mention which is a worthwhile part of the book.Exercises and techniques are given for most of the major body parts but these are something you could get in any other bodybuilding book....a few nice ones are those unique to Larry Scott like scapular rolls , correct way to do the Preacher curl and the Ring of Fire technique.The book is also available from Larry Scott associates website for around USD 50...in my opinion not worth that much unless you're a really big fan of Larry Scott."
5,Magical!,"I originally read ""The Smoker"" in the New Yorker and thought it was simply the best short story I had ever read. I bought the book and have not been disappointed with the other tales. David Schickler's stories are incredibly well-written, at times funny, suspenseful and always magical."
3,"Clever, touching, but not first class","Like another reader, I had trouble getting through the first story and its rape fantasies. I put the book down for over a year and then thought I'd pick it up again. I was glad I did finish it, and found it clever, warming, readable, human. On the other hand, sometimes too clever, plot rather forced, reads a bit too much like a creative writing program workshop product. Just doesn't make it to the high quality level."
5,Sustained Quality,"After reading the Smoker and learing that it won an O'Henry award, I was curious to see if all of the stories in Schickler's first novel could live up to such a high standard of excellence. They do."
3,Too Precious...,"Talented, yes. But Schickler's characters are so completely over the top that they read like caricatures of people. And his rendition of New York City is just too precious to be anywhere near believable. If you're looking for intriguing stories set in the big city I recommend New York Trilogy by Paul Auster."
1,"All style, no substance","And I didn't even like the style. The characters are shallow and the plot is thin and contrived in this collection of loosely-strung stories of sheer male fantasy. Some books inspire me, some books entertain me. This book was a total bore, inspiring me to nothing but annoyance at having spent 20-some bucks on the hardcover edition, and then wonder that this guy ever got a story into the New Yorker. Don't believe the hype on this one - the emperor has no clothes."
3,"Im[pressive, but ultimately disappointing","I found so much more than I expected in this novel, but in the end was disappointed as is eeked out a predictable death. Unfortunately it could not sustain the unique point of view of the author, and eventually disintigrated into a hollywood-in-waiting style ending. I will certainly follow this author, as I really enjoyed the bulk of the stories, individually."
3,"OK, Male Fantasy","Interesting book but seemed like a male fantasy. I did not like and could not relate to any of the characters. The fantasy, magical aspects of the book were the best part and interesting."
3,I thought this one was alright- nothing totally special,I liked the premiss all the stories and how they intertwined with each other. But then I was disappointed on how some of the stories ended and how you didn't find out what happens to the characters.
2,"All Pose, Little Substance","Okay, here's the latest thing that not-very-smart people can feel smart about liking. It's provocative (in a simplistic way), surrealistic, and utterly without emotional heft. But it has the patina of knowingness and sophistication, so people can feel safe championing it at cocktail parties. But, alas, it's empty; it confuses non-sequitur with originality, provocativeness with true meaning, elusiveness with complexity. But don't buy the hype. Here's a writer who obviously has talent, but who must learn to be honest--to forget the posing--if he's ever to produce anything really worthwhile."
3,Short Stories Creating a Larger Tableau,"This debut collection of short stories (maybe it's better to refer to is as a novel) does a wonderful job of blending together the lives of a group of young New Yorkers living in the Preemption Building on the Upper West Side. All of the stories center around relationships, both good and bad, and culminate in a startling conclusion involving a gun, a priest, and a love triangle between three of the most unlikely people. What makes the work so vivid in my mind is the way that you learn more about each of the characters not from their own stories, but from the stories of the people around them. I especially loved the sort of magical realism that Schickler infuses the novel with and it reminded me of a cross between Auster and Marquez. This is definitely a solid debut and one that will keep you entertained."
1,Annoyingly bad,"I made it through four of the shorts, but I must confess that I was enjoying getting annoyed by it. There is nothing here: no plots, no character development, no insight, no intrigue. I felt like I was wandering around in somebody's desperate fantasy. Desperate? Yes, there is desperation in every nook and cranny of the 4 stories I read - desperation to make empty characters quirky, desperation to conclude stories that have no premise, and desperation to contrive motion in stories that have no reason to move. I've rarely felt this way, but I feel like throwing the book down the garbage shoot as opposed to passing it on."
5,simply gorgeous,"this book is sensuous, yet intelligent. even the dark stories are so rich and fluid. this is a must have on any bookhelf!"
3,Very Average,"While the story does come alive as the novel moves on, it is rather obvious that this is the author's first attempt at a novel. It seems a little ""unfinished"" at the beginning. The author presents the reader with unecessary facts in a very uninteresting way, preffering to just state them right off instead of letting the reader figure things out."
2,Not MY New York,"Not everybody in New York is a Jewish neurotic. But David Schickler sure makes it seems like they are. Listen: When I first moved here from Nebraska that was one of the things I was afraid of, that I'd run into all these ethnic types. (Don't want to sound like a John Rocker about it, but I was just a kid and the biggest place I'd ever seen was Lincoln.) Maybe it's more colorful to pretend everybody's Jewish and that New York is filled with differently colored people like some kind of sock drawer. Not true. My New York is homogeneous, the way I like it. Schickler's is dangerous, challenging, a little weird, and not at all my cup of tea. If you're like me, stay the heck away."
4,"A Distinct Voice, A Charming Book","Okay, first off, try to get by the title. It sounds like a cheap romance novel, or the most sacchrine piece of writing you'll ever hope to come across. It's not.Whew, now that we got that out of the way, this book of linked stories is most distinctive for Mr. Shickler's unique voice. He writes in crisp, clear, simple sentences. At the same time, with a few simple words, he can capture a mood or the essence of a character so perfectly it can at times take your breath away.This book isn't a staggering piece of fiction. It's also not exactly a short story collection (he gives up on the finesse of interlinking stories by the last half of the book; it becomes more of a novel, albeit a good one). Mr. Shickler also hasn't written a cheesy piece of romance fiction; he's written a book that is both charming and darkly humourous in equal measure.An exciting debut for a young writer, and a great read for anyone who has ever lived in, or thought about living in New York."
3,"Great literary work, but very dark.","Interesting concept how these many short stories wind up really being one novel. I loved how all the stories interconnected, but I found the subject matter to be real dark at times. This is great literary-wise, but it won't lighten your mood."
3,Good start then fizzles,"I started out enjoying this book. I like how Schickler introduces each of his characters, brief stories with a different character in focus. The characters in the background of one story become the focus of the next story.But then the stories jump around a bit too much. There is never an even ""flow"" to the story. Interesting characters that are introduced early in the book (Checkers, Jax) are only mentioned in passing later.It seems a large, solid foundation was set then only part of the house was built on that foundation."
2,"Sadly, this book kind of sucks","The ""Smokers"" story is a classic. No doubt. The others are all filler with lame attempts at connections. The elevator? Who the hell cares?I'm glad Schickler was able to weasel a big book deal out of one story, but, like Kajagoogoo, I think he's a one-hit wonder."
1,Don't believe the hype...,"This book is misogynistic and banal. If you need to affirm your relationship with New York, then visit or rent a movie by Woody Allen or, if you must, read 'Bright Lights, Big City' which has altogether more heart and density than this over-hyped, lightweight, 'East-Village cool' series of short stories."
2,Unsatisfying,"I think Schickler wrote this book after one too many martinis, or after reading the New York Post for three weeks straight. It attempts to look at both the underbelly and the inner lives of yuppie New Yorkers. The use of the apartment building as a framing device is interesting, but it ultimately points out the book's weakness: a thin plot, and some rather misogynistic, anti-woman writing. Schickler is really interested in the story of one woman, Evie, and the two roommates who both want her. That the story is ultimately sick and simplistic is dissappointing; but that Schickler makes us wade through some sort of mediocre, almost-unrelated chapters on other apartment dweller is worse. Read the gossip pages instead."
4,Elegant and fresh,I was not expecting to like this book as much as I did. The stories are both gentle and insightful. The author is witty without sneering and he is even merciful to his villains. Another way to look at this book is as a valentine to NYC.
3,Has its good points,"Schickler seems to delight in his writing, and that delight is infectious. His descriptions can be fun, and his characters are original. Some of his work is successfully erotic. There is generally a good balance between the fantastical and the realistic. Yet it was primarily the last 1/3 of the book, beginning with James Branch's childhood, that I enjoyed.The characters lack depth, and are therefore hard to get involved with. The descriptive material focus on female beauty, and the beauty of old, sumptuous things; it can sometimes get tiresome and repetitive. Even the last part of the book could have benefitted from more real interaction between the characters, and Patrick Rigg's happenings were pretty dull. The book ends well, with that last exchange between Patrick and James. Spoiler alert: ""Do you know what its like ....being awake inside but not talking? ....I do."""
2,Too contrived with unlikable characters,"The concept and part of the execution of this book are interesting, but many of the characters are just too unbelievable to really have resonance. I felt that many of the characters and situations seemed contrived to be shocking and gripping, but the effort to create them rather than tell their stories, seemed too evident. Some stories were interesting, but a few were downright annoying.I give it 2 stars, but feel 2 1/2 is more appropriate, considering I think Schickler uses some good language. He just needs to send his characters through a plausibility checker."
5,Magnífico...,"Yo sabia poco de la discografía de este grupo Mexicano. Este DVD incluye varios temas y me gusto mucho las letras, las ganas que le ponen los integrantes de la orquesta al interpretar sus instrumentos, sobretodo la bateria. El sonido es bueno pero podría ser mejor. En Dolby Digital no suena el parlante central."
1,Doesn't read DVD,terrible! this dvd won't play in any dvd player. apparently all U.S dvd's have a region code and this dvd i don't know where it comes from but certainly does not play. Seller should advise buyer of this problem
3,Mana - MTV Unplugged,"THIS DISK FEATURES THE BAND'S MTV UNNPLUGGED SHOW. IT ALSO FEATURES BEHIND THE SCENES FOTAGES, INTERVIEWS, WEB ACCESS, DISCOGRAPHY, INTERACTIVE MENUS IN ENGLISH AND SPANICH, TWO ADDITIONAL VIDEOS, DD 5.1, DD 2.0 STEREO."
3,"thermometer, outdoor","Extremely hard to find an outdoor thermometer on a bracket outside a window. This is about the only one I could find for the last couple years. However, they are becoming smaller on the scale size I am sure for budget reasons. Also, is there anyone in this Country who gives a crap about Centigrade? I am very sorry we reversed on converting to Metric, but we did not. So just why muddy up the product? Who is impressed by this these days?"
5,Amazing,"It's amazing that these guys are still relatively unknown. You need this CD if you like Uranium 235, Genitorturers, or Orgy. Marilyn Manson fans, this is also right up your alley. Very spookykid-ish. Other related soundpools: NIN, KMFDM, Rammstein. The music is electro-metal. The voice is a little whiny but definitely not screamed or overstretched. One of my most treasured possessions."
4,White teeth!,"This stuff's the real deal. Found it on Amazon at half the price at which my dentist originally sold it to me. I'm told bleaching trays are better than bleach strips sold over the counter, longer lasting for the money."
5,Satisfied customer,The Nite While arrived on time and was in condition (new) as described. I wish I'd ordered more! This was a good value and will order again.
4,Fast and pain-free,"This product is to be used for no more than one hour at a time which makes it easy to fit into a busy day and eliminates tooth sensitivity. Whitening power is good. Every use made my teeth whiter. The only odd thing was that immediately after each use, the middle of each tooth was whiter than the rest. For this reason, I whitened at the end of my day so that by morning, the color of my teeth had evened out. This 3-tube pack was the perfect amount. In a year, I'll order a fresh batch for a ""brightening-up""."
1,Was sent wrong item!,"Be wary of this company... they sent me the old formula, NiteWhite ACP 4-Pack Kit 22%, NOT what was advertised. Amazon doesn't stand behind 3rd party sellers, so you're on your own in trying to get the problem resolved. If you order something from Gamma Discount, do so at your own risk."
2,Does not whiten!,"Quality control is an issue. I have had good experience in the past and now, it does not work. They have offered to refund my money which is a good sign."
3,Can cause sensitivity...,I like this product as it does work. I don't like how its really strong that my teeth do become sensitive. I actually now prefer the overnight kind versus this two hour version.
1,blah,"I didn't need to whiten my teeth too much, just a slight discoloration. White the product arrived with great time, it did nothing for my teeth except make them so sensitive that I had to do the process only once every 3 days instead of daily."
2,PRODUCT ARRIVED NOT AS ADVERTIZED,"I've used Nite White 22% for over 8 years now, even though the seller describes this as a ""new product"" it has phillips name on it & is not the same packaging as advertized. Be careful & know what you are ordering before making this purchase."
5,Great Product,"After I used the product twice, you could definitely tell the difference and my teeth were noticeably whiter. I received the product in a timely manner and received exactly what I had ordered. I am perfectly happy with this product and will order more when I need to. It did not make my teeth sensitive as another product had done. Very pleased."
2,Product not as pictured or described,"The product arrived quickly BUT it is NOT the product shown on the picture. It says in the description that it is NiteWhite Excel, which is supposed to be made by Discus Dental. The product that I received is Philips Zoom. It does say NiteWhite underneath but I am not sure how it is related to the Discus Dental NiteWhite if at all. Have not tried it yet so I have nothing to say about the quality and the effectiveness of it so far. I'll post the review regarding this later."
1,This does not work,This product does not work. I purchased this last week thinking it was a good deal and it said an expiration of 5/2010 but it obviously already expired because I wore it for 3 days straight and all this it did was make my gums swollen and raw. It DID NOT whiten my teeth and I have used Nite White in the past and have had wonderful results. This is not worth the purchase and there are no refunds or exchanges. It costs more to get it from the doctor but it is worth the money because with these mail deals it's a crap shoot and in this case just crap. Do not buy this product.
1,"Content, good; quality bad","Fisher is a prolific contributor to the early modern synthesis. However, this particular book gets a low rating because it has been xeroxed from a library copy and is filling with markings. I recommend the 'complete voriorum' edition, which is of very high quality."
5,catharsis...,"In a music business perpetrated by sham bands built in some record company executive's image, Radiohead is a necessary, refreshing schism from the mold. Their music is honest, intelligent, and real. This video shows the band to be all too human- these five men are no rock stars! Watch for how their moods alter when placed in front of an interviewer's microphone. Will you feel as uncofortable as they appear? just see it...Dan Garavuso"
4,No Surprises here for real Radiohead fans,"I finally bought this video after seeing clips of it on MTV. There are obvious disappointments in this video including the lack of live video coverage, and also cutting off interviewers quesitons. The thing I find most intriguing about Radiohead aside from their music, is their views on world issues and their sometimes sarcastic answers to empty-headed reporters. Many times in the video, the questions are asked, but you never get to hear the band's answer. The glimpses you get of unreleased songs is cool, especially the performance of big ideas. THe video ultimately portrays the meaning of the album OK Computer, which shows the bad sides of politics, commercialization and non-individualsm. Overall, very cool and worth buying. As others mentioned, if you are not a true Radiohead fan (ie you just like the song Creep), stay away from the video. The band does not want your money."
5,MPIE,"""Meeting People Is Easy"" provides an insightful look into what it is like to be Radiohead. It does not show what it is like for other groups, considering that I have seen other famous groups say that being famous is totally different than what is portrayed on this video.It is done mostly in black and white, and is mostly comprised of clips of interviews, and live performances. There are about four unreleased songs on this video that you can hear, but sometimes they are dubbed over with the band talking.It also shows very good footage of the band, and gives you a great idea what it must be like for them to be touring. You also see what the band (mostly Thom) feels about issues; and not just music. Politics and personal views. As I said before, there are many interviews.It is a good video for the Radiohead fan; I know I loved it. -Well- worth the money. It provides insight, knowledge, and the songs of Radiohead."
1,Torture,"Jlong has it right. I like Radiohead, but this movie is a boring piece of pretentious c**p. You get to see Radiohead being pissed off with doing interviews. Twenty times. To save money: instead of buying the movie, look at their record sleeves whilst jiggling them around a bit and get a friend to whine about nothing."
1,cuts to [...] at the best parts,I'm sorry. I am a true Radiohead fanatic but this video is painful to watch. Just when you think you are about to see the most solemn beautiful version of Lucky it cuts to some [...] of photographers taking pictures of the band. It goes down hill from there.Not an entire song on the whole video although you get annoying bits and peices. Not an entire interview on the whole video although you get annoying bits and peices. Boy wouldn't it be great if there was one song on here? What you are left with is just a cult of personality peice.I watched it one time hoping it would improve. It never did and I had to gave it to my nephew.
1,"I Love RADIOHEAD, Hated This ""Film""!","I only moments ago removed this DVD from my player and whipped it against my living room wall. Grant gee seems to want to convince us that RADIOHEAD made this Grammy Award music by accident and now are being punished for their brilliance.The choppy MTV style editing dosen't suit the band nor the snippets of their music that plays in the background.This ""film' serves as nothing but as an infomercial for their next album. There are no redeeming qualities about this ""film'. Excuse me while I go vomit."
2,we want Infomation,"It would be nice if somebody could tell us what songs are on this thing. Also, what the performances are like. You lucky american kids getting this on DVD way before us in Britain."
5,Inspiring,"This film is brilliant. As a songwriter/musician, it reminds me of the pitfalls of the business. The film is powerful. IF you want pure concert footage, do not buy this film. This is a work of art unto itself with Radiohead as a sub-theme."
4,OK <DVD,"I bought this DVD expecting to see some OK footage of Radiohead, and I was pleasantly surprised to find a documentary that had alot to offer. The live performances, interviews, and critics give you a back door pass to what goes on in the band members lives. When one starts to become weary of watching the movie, one can also see the band becoming weary. Like when Thom is drunk of his but and starts contemplating why they are even on tour. If a Radiohead fan is so inclined to buy this, they will have a substantial treat to enjoy for some time."
4,A Worthwhile Purchase for a Radiohead Fan,"As others have stated, the band does portray a rather boring life as documented, however the concert scenes are fantastic - and it offers an interesting perspective into an interesting band."
2,"Snazzy, but empty.","The documentary LOOKS cool, and it creates a mood that goes very well with radiohead's music. But 90 minutes of that is way too long. After it's all over, you realize that the film has failed to deliver a single coherent bit of information about the band. You don't really get a good insider's view -- and you certainly don't get to know any of the band members, see much of the creative process of songwriting, or hear the members' true thoughts about their work. It's a disappointment, and a missed chance on the part of Gee. So buy this video if you need it to complete your collection, but don't expect to learn anything from it, either about the band or about music-making in general."
2,LETDOWN,"The idea behind Grant Gee's film, ""Meeting People is Easy"" may have been brilliant but this long awaited and much anticipated documentary failed to hit it's mark. The concept of how boring life on the ""OK Computer tour was just turned ot to be a boring video about Radiohead. Despite some flashes of great camera work and some brief sounds of unreleased music, this documentary is a big disappointment to any Radiohead fan. I would leave this one out of the ""Shopping Cart"" and save those hard earned pennies for the new album. Please write me for a more detailed review,Thanks"
1,"Appalling, pseudo-arty rubbish!","'Meeting People is Easy' is perhaps the most shallow, prententious, pseudo-arty films ever made. Whereas the album 'OK Computer' brilliantly dealt with themes that could easily be related to (such as fear of technology, political frustration, etc), this documentary consistently misfires. The live footage only seems to consist of Thom whining at the top of his voice and the interviews are treated so seriously by the band, the whole endeavour reaches states of self-parody. The attempt to show the difficulty in touring for rock bands fails completely, and the band members, especially the pathetic Yorke, come across as hopeless and ungrateful for the position they are in. Seeing this film has caused me to dread their next release, as it will only mean seeing them become more and more conceited."
4,For the dedicated,"If this video is the same version as the one released in England months ago (makes a change that we actually get something before the U.S) then this is well worth purchasing. It's a documentary more than anything that will give you a good insight into the minds of the band (Thom in particular). However, the best bit for me was when we were shown the band recording their new album - simply amazing. All in all this film was a good experience but prehaps could have shown a few more shots of them in concert. Every Radiohead fan needs to (and no doubt will), buy this video."
4,Colorless Blue Thoughts,"Meeting People Is Easy is an ironic, brilliant and graphical expose of one of post-pops most exploited and misunderstood band of our day; Radiohead!!!! The film dives like a swan into the viscera of depression and holds you there until you are drowning in the deluge of image and sound. One literally has to periodically kick back to the surface of reality for a gasp of air and the comfort of being able to discern between the life of the band and your own. Frenetic, disturbing, and true-to-form, Meeting People is Easy is a poignant and morose portrayal of rock-stardom one would not feign to want. Yet, the images presented in the film are similar to those of car accidents. You want to stop and look."
1,I'm sick of these s**t releases on DVD,"I JUST WANT A LIVE DVD !!!!Radiohead is fantastic, extraordinary, different, dark, intense, addictive, magic, confusing, avant garde, experimental, etc. Nothing of that is reflected with these stupid DVD's they have released. This king of DVD just contain lame boring stuff for filling the running Time and to be put on sale.I do not understand why they do not make an awesome live DVD instead of this kind of s**t. Radiohead is brilliant, but sometimes they are too obstinate and they do not understand - or they do not want to understand - that fans we are not interested in these useless DVD's for TV filled with interviews and all that bulls**t.Live Gigs always have been the best thing of Radiohead. There're dozens of complete live performances shared as Pro-Shot DVD bootlegs out there !!!!, but I want an official release !!!.PLEASE RADIOHEAD"
2,Seriously nothing special...,"I have been a Radiohead fan for about 2 and a half years now and I finally bought my first Radiohead DVD. I was expecting some weird, trippy stuff with some really good live and studio footage.The DVD is trippy alright, almost as scary as the Ring. But the live performances don't seem to sparkle or shine, and the band looks bored most of the time. I've tried to watch this DVD three different times now, and I've had to get up and stop the movie in the middle every time, because I just got bored with it. I even tried watching the second half. I just couldn't. It was too long and tiring.I would not recommend this DVD unless you can get it used for a really cheap price like I did. It's pointless, senseless, and just plain dumb. Thank you for your time."
1,NOT ENOUGH RADIO HEAD,"I WAS LOOKING FOR COMPLETE MUSIC FROM RADIO HEAD. I WANT TO HEAR A LIVE VERSION OF ""I'AM A CREEP"" THAT WENT FROM BEGINNING TO END. I AM A LITTLE OLDER NOW, FANCY CAMERA EDITING WITH RADIO HEADS COOL MUSIC DOESN'T DO A THING FOR ME. CHERRISH THE COMPACT DISK MUSIC AND WAIT FOR A MUSIC VIDEO INSTEAD OF A CULT VIDEO."
1,Bad job,"The worst musical film which I saw...... Only director's delirium..... It is better to make more concert performances, instead of cut off piecesThe clips instead of bad director's job are necessary to the fans"
2,BORING and Pretentious,"Oooooh, it's so hard being a rock star. Tries to arty, but in reality is a big mess of poor editing and lousy song choices. Maybe I just didn't get it..."
3,"Not bad, Not great","Radiohead is one of my top ten favorite bands. When I saw this video, I was kind of let down because I would have really liked to see the live songs all the way through. However, I can see why Grant Gee chose not to put the entire songs in the film. There are many clips and much cinematography which definitely sets the mood for the OK Computer tour, but the film leaves you with an odd feeling of what it really meant. I don't like that, but I think that that is the feeling Grant Gee was trying to make in this movie. It is certainly not a bad movie, but I expected more from it. If you like Radiohead, I would recommend seeing it. If you don't like Radiohead, don't bother."
4,Trippy look into a tour that is definately out of this world,"The cool thing is the editing. They were able to make a lot of that little JVC mini-DV camera look a bit like film. It may come across a bit too depressing, but it shows the mad genius of Radiohead. I would have liked to have seen more live stuff of KARMA POLICE and AIRBAG. The editing (mostly just making mini-DV look like film) is inspiring to a digital filmmaker."
4,Grammy Nominated,"Grant Gee does a superb job of cutting through the typical Rockumentary cliche, and showing us just how tedious it must be to be on tour, while being the critics' darlings. What emerges is a picture of a band truly in love with performing great music. Fans of the band will be captivated by live performances of unreleased tracks -- some of which will almost certainly appear on the fourth LP (""Follow Me Around,"" ""Big Ideas,"" and a failed attempt to recording one the best Radiohead songs I've ever heard, ""Big Boots/Man-o-War."" Those less familiar with the band still get great filmmaking (though one or two of the montages were a little hokey), great music, and a peek inside one of the most intelligent and talented bands to emerge in twenty years."
5,Grant Gee tunes in perfectly to Radiohead's renegade genius.,"Have you ever wondered how Thom Yorke comes up with unabashedly subvesive lyrics such as""...like a cat tied to a stick in frozen winter shit""? After watching ""Meeting People is Easy"" directed by fellow dissident Grant Gee, you may still be wondering, but you will also be spellbound by Gee's visual integration of those and other maddeningly disarming and often indecipherable lyric scenes from the operatic vision of this band. I dare you not to be mesmerized by the visual display of the essence of what it means to be a critically acclaimed, relatively ""super"" group that doesn't believe one single word of the hype that, organically, must accompany that level of success. It's an all-encomassing task to keep your ethical head above water. Which Thom DOESN'T do in perhaps one of the most enjoyable (and, of course, horrifying) moments of a two hour music video that's ten times easier to watch than most any other 3 minute clip on music TV."
3,Not what I hoped for,My hopes for when I got this DVD were to get lots of live concert footage of Radiohead playing music or maybe some music videos. Maybe I didn't read the packaging because that isn't what this DVD is.Meeting People is Easy is a documentary film that follows Radiohead around post release of OK Computer and shows them in there day to day life touring and working on music and on occasion might show a small clip from a concert. The film is good on this documentary stand point but if like me you want to see Radiohead live footage or music videos this DVD is not for you.
3,...,"I do not recommend this to non-Radiohead fans. Apart from interviews with Thom and Colin, this film is nothing but much-too-long shots of mindless, useless imagery (think Japanese people in escalators for 5 minutes straight with a distorted ""Climbing Up the Walls"" playing in the background, or something of the sort). At times, the background music overpowers the speaker and most of the backstage scenes seem unneccessary, rather dull, actually. 1.5 hours of Grant Gee showing off his ""superior"" film-making skills by showing clips of Thom played *gasp* backwards. ""Look, mommy! Pretentious crap!"" I love Radiohead, but this is just awful. Worth it just to see Thom squeal as he receives his gold/platinum/whatnot record and for the Creep performance."
1,"No, it's not OK, Computer!","Exciting. Thought-provoking. Life-changing. Everything that Radiohead, The Most Important Band There Is Right Now (or at least until ""Amnesiac"") is, this DVD isn't. It's truly amazing how awful this film is, from its Z-grade film school cliches (Ooo! Fuzzy industrial monochromed images with scrolling text! How innovative) to the stultifying dull cinema verite shots of the band mumbling incoherently or posing in front of fans, cameras, and what have you. When you finally fast-forward through the desultory filler to the concert pieces, you get poorly shot, dismally recorded documents of Radiohead at their most self-indulgent.Radiohead is important enough for a director with Scorcese or Demme-level talent to document in a manner they deserve. In this piece of junk, the hack director drains the life of the band...to everyone's dismay."
4,"some pros, some cons...","PROS: Some of the footage of public transportation is really interesting. The live performances are stunning as usual, plus you get to hear them play some rare songs like ""Big Ideas,"" ""Follow Me Around,"" ""Pearly,"" and this funky version of ""Life in a Glasshouse"" that has different lyrics, is guitar-based, and is (obviously) without a horn section. I also like the segment documenting the shooting of the ""No Surprises"" video.CONS: There are only 2 chapters in the whole DVD, which can get really irritating if you just want to see one song, like ""Follow Me Around."" Also, the director has the notorious habit of showing the band playing an incredible, rare song live and then cutting to some stupid interview in the middle of the song.OVERALL: Worth your money. Not the best DVD possible, but the pros generally outweigh the cons."
5,Gorgeous and very soft and warm. Will buy more!,"This wine/gold baby alpaca cape is just beautiful. I wore it outside when it was in the 50s, and felt great! The combination of colors is phenomenal; it can be worn with most things you'd wear in the cooler seasons. I'm definitely putting a black one on my list of possible gifts for my next birthday! FYI, this can be worn by women just about any age; I'm 30."
5,Baby Alpaca Wool Shawl,"To Whom It May Concern:I purchased this Baby Alpaca Wool Shawl for my mother last week, received it as described, and in a timely manner, my mother absolutely loves it, it is so soft and warm on her skin, and it doesn't make her itch or irritated at all, I would definitely recommend it to someone special in your life without a doubt.Sincerely,Richard/ral"
4,Easy and good recipes,I picked this book up while on vacation in Maine. I love blueberries and the many variety of recipes including blueberries is amazing.
5,Boys & Girl from County Clare,"We love Irish movies, and were glad to add this one to our collection...very enjoyable movie that we will watch again and again!"
4,A movie for people who love Irish music,I really enjoyed this film. The competition scenes had my toes tapping. A great Irish film!
3,The boys and girl from county Clare,Enjoyed watching this movie although the story line was quite predictable.A good relaxing movie to view. I lived in Ireland for over 5 years so thisbrought back memories. The actors especially Colm Meaney did a great job.
3,A pleasant movie,"Although some of the plotlines and jokes are predictable, the movie still entertains. Those who enjoy traditional Irish music, or movies such as ""Waking Ned Devine"", ""Local Hero"", ""The Commitments"" and ""The Snapper"" should give this movie a watch - although not quite as good as any of the above, it is certainly worth a viewing.For those who play traditional Irish music, you will love the session ""in-jokes"" such as the visiting American band playing ""Irish Washerwoman"", one band-leader's admonition ""...you're playing the accordion for starters!"", and the scene of a session being over-run by a horde of novice bodhran players.Speaking from the viewpoint of one who plays traditional music, the only irksome thing about the movie is that the lead woman (from the Corrs) FAILS TO MOVE HER FINGERS AT ALL as she pretends to play the fiddle. This is even more strange, considering that she actually CAN play the fiddle quite well in real life. How did that one get by the director?"
3,A lot of barfing--it's not pleasant,"I bought this film because I really love Colm Meaney--a great actor. (""The Van"" is a really good film, but hard to find.) And I think this is probably a pretty decent film once you get past its flaw: people seem to be barfing all over the place. I'm not talking a little off-camera puke, I'm talking about Niagra Falls--and the people reaching into it to get their false teeth. Personally, I find it gross. To sit down to eat dinner and watch a movie and then watch half the cast spew, forget it. If there was a good movie in here, they lost me 10 minutes into the film. I wish I could get my money back."
3,Could Have Been Better,"The movie had an interesting story line. There was music, competition, baby daddy drama, all the makings of a great plot. But for some reason it just couldn't keep my focus. Maybe I have ADD, who knows. It was a good film, but I wouldn't watch it more than once."
1,Worst Irish movie seen,From start to end this is the worst Irish movie I have seen. Poor acting. Poor story line. A real disappointment. Don't buy it!
1,The worst movie I have ever seen.,Firstly like Waking Ned Devine this movie is not shot in Ireland but in The Isle of man which looks nothing like Clare. While the music is passable the acting especially from Andrea Corr is wooden and predictable as is the story line. I now put Colm Meany in with Michael Caine and Donald Plesence as actors who will do anything for a quick buck
2,Okay if it worked properly,"The movie would be good if I could watch it all the way through. Unfortunately the dvd is defective and only works when you start up through scene selections. Admittedly, the dvd format is in a different region to that used in Aus but the dvd does work on one of my dvd players. It will be unlikely that I purchase dvd's from Amazon again."
4,Excellent Movie for Irish Music Lovers,I really enjoyed this movie especially since Andrea Corr plays one of the main characters and she is one of the singers in the Corrs music group. The scenery is beautiful Irish countryside. You really get a taste of the culture during that time period. There is not only serious heart felt moments but whitty dry humor. Highly recommended.
4,...really enjoyed this film,"Andrea Corr does an excellent job. Scenery is beautiful even though it might not be Clara County. Corr has that special 'look' that translates well on film.I must say..the fake fiddling is the worst I have seen. I am surprised that Andrea Corr (others) could not have make it more convincing...considering that Corr is a musician.Regardless, it's a story with heart and all the elements."
5,Not sure B. Beaux's agenda but this book is phenominal!,"B. Beaux's review is not even for this book - it seems as though his political agenda should be put in a blog not a book review. I was a teacher so I am extremely familiar with Love and Logic - they are based out of Evergreen - not Colorado Springs and have no affiliation with any ""christian cult"".I gave this book to my mother and it is so refreshing to have parents and grandparents on the same page as far as dealing with the kids goes. It helps avoid a ton of potential arguements. My mother and father just loved it! They actually told me they wished this was around when I was younger because they would have loved to use it on me (I was a bit of a trouble maker)."
1,outdated- advocates spanking,"I have been a huge advocate of all the other Love and Logic books, and am greatly disappointed to see that this book advocates spanking. The more recent publications do not. This book needs to be released with a correction to the spanking portion, or pulled from the marked entirely, as it does not comply with the author's current views on spanking. I WAS planning on giving the book as a gift to my parents. Instead, I am returning the book to amazon.com at my cost."
2,Don't bother,"The information is dull, unoriginal, and common sense. I got nothing out of the bookthat was new or clever. It could be read in one sitting."
5,Very helpful!,These books are great for helping your kids learn to parent better. Excellent tips and ideas and suggestions! My daughter really appreciated them and having us on the same page was great!
2,Not for us.,"Our family did not care for this book, and our children's doctors did not care for its principles, either. Not for everyone."
4,Down to the Benoit,"David Benoit's 'ReJoyce' - a tribute to jazz guitarist Joyce Cooling - was my favourite song of 2000. So when I heard he was going to collaborate with another of my fav groups, 'Down to the Bone', I was euphoric. Wow! What a great CD that would be! *sigh* Well, I have to say that although I love David I am a little disappointed. Some of the tracks just don't do it for me. Has he been watching re-runs of 'The Man From Uncle'? (Listen to 'Reflections' and 'War of the SUV's' and you'll see what I mean) Still, I prefer the Napolean Solo suspense music to David tinkling up and down the entire keyboard. And why does he have to end each CD with a really schmaltzy song?Never mind. The track 'Then The Morning Comes' is worth the price of the whole CD. And I love 'You Read My Mind' and 'Tango in Barbados'. If you're a DB fan like me, you'll forgive him the rest."
4,Beautiful piano but lacking a little something...,"I have just recently started in on the smooth jazz scene and this was one of the first cds I bought. I just happened upon it at my local Borders store, listened to the first two tracks and decided to get it. Good funky rythms, with some good humor and accompanyists (see War of the S.U.V.s) His version of Then the Morning Comes is a lighter, jazzy version and a lot of fun to listen to. The last track is truly a beautiful, moving piece. Great for staring out the window. This is definitely easy listening and highly recommended for those that want something of that type with a little spice thrown in it.However I did feel that something was lacking. There were times when I really wanted him to break out and get a real groove moving, but the track stayed back with the relaxed piano sound...Still, this is a great addition to Benoit's discography, bringing out a real fun side in him."
4,Comfortable Bodyboard Fin,"This fin is a descendent of the original NeoFin from Southern California. The original was ""hand made"" in SoCal and was of very high quality. I still use a pair. Body Glove's version is not as well made, but they are still very comfortable compard to standard hard rubber bodyborad fins. Thrust is not as good as hard fins, but for small fun waves, you can't beat the overall comfort with the soft neoprene foot pocket and neoprene strap. Surprised that they are not (or were not) more popular."
3,Most comfortable fins I've ever owned but...,"I used to own a pair of these when they we're made by neofin and I loved them, but they eventually fell apart, so I bought a new pair. The new pair was just as comfortable but even poorer quality. I've had them about 3 months and use them 3-4 times a week for bodysurfing. The strap on one of them completely tore off, so I sewed it back on, with a drill and some tie wraps. And the entire foot pocket on the other fin completely ripped out, so I had to sew it back on as well. I still use them and they are very comfortable, I'm just very dissappointed in their quality. If you don't mind sewing them back up when they rip, and they will, then they're definitely the most comfortable pair of fins you'll ever own. Otherwise, skip them."
4,Works fine.,4 stars instead of 5 because this product requires a power connection.Why can't it just draw from the AGP port?Product works just fine.
5,Makes You Dance,"And I'm not a dancer. Anyway, I first heard Controller.Controller live when they were playing for free at UofT's frosh week concert. I was really getting into their music. So, I picked up their EP and it's amazing. Great energy, great beats/grooves. If you like music by Metric or Franz Ferdinand I think you would like Controller.Controller. This album is obviously too short and the only thing I would say is that their tracks are all fast on this (because it's their EP). Their new album ""X-Amounts"" comes out TOMORROW (October 11th, 2005). I'm hoping that it's amazing. Check this out, people!"
5,Amazing,"Highly recommend this purchase. Great to just sit back and place on repeat. Darkish, but with plenty of energy."
5,Texas Rangers,Bought this for my husband and he says it is very factual and a very good book as well as holding his interest.
5,"Though I haven't read it yet,",I found it(the millenium edition) online as a pdf or ps file. I think this book is good because I see it in many bibliography of the books of related subjects. Try any search engine under the book title.
2,Torin T84801 Red Mini Service Jack,In May 21 I received a Torin Jack item. the Torin T84801 is much shorter from length than i expected. Amazon's page didn't describe (specification) how size of the T84801 was.I won't be able to this item.
1,Worst calculus prep ever!,"This book does not give you enough practice on calculus. The author gives you an idea of how to do some of the problems by giving easy examples. The practice ap exams are too easy. This book is much worse than Barron's ap calculus prep book, which gives you more than 50 MC in each chapter and more than 200 further practice problems. Barron's book also includes 4 practice ap exams for cal ab and bc each.i would suggest you save the money to buy barron's book instead."
2,Only if your class/course demand it,"This book is a requirement to take the real estate exam in CA. That's the only reason one should buy this book. And even that, is questionable."
4,Fired my imagination as a child,"I first encountered this wonderful book as a nine year old child with an eye for science fiction. I spent many months pouring over its text and imaginative paintings. As the title hints, the book is written as a 'manual' for identification of spacecraft types in wide use during the last one hundred years. The objective 'historical' writing style contributes to the readers desire to suspend disbelief and get caught up in one hundred years of war and commerce driven spacecraft design. Amazingly, the hundreds of paintings that bring the text to life are given a blanket credit to a single agency and none are given individual artist credits. All of the paintings are first rate examples of the art at the time, before George Lucas' ""used universe"" style would dominate the scene. I would recommend this book to any fan of science fiction."
2,Not my idea of fun.,"I have read other books by Alesia Holliday and enjoyed them so I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I could not get any farther than the first 25 pages. I even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and I still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away. The best I can do to pin down why I dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard. No character seems to even approach reality. They are all, including the main character and her love interest, over the top."
3,slow start,"Take a 30 something woman with insecurities and ""storm"" tendencies-- add in a job that seems surreal and other characters that seem as though they are on a day pass and you have the start of this book.I have to admit the first half of the book I was not impressed with -- but as I continued with reading it -- I enjoyed the book more and more -- It is not my usual type of book but it is good to get out of the box now and then to stretch the legs."
1,Poorly Designed,It comes in several pieces with screws included. Some of the screws stripped out of the wood and I had to basically nail it together to make it functional. And one of the drawer pieces was missing. Not worth the buy.
2,not recommended,Quality is fine. But I think this item is overprice at $48. A reasonal price should be about $20.
2,Not as expected,The nightstand was a completely different color than what is shown online plus it came broken. It was not made from a good material...very cheap looking. We sent it back and got a refund.
4,nice table for a little money,I ordered this table to use as an end table in our family room. I'd been looking for a while - couldn't find a decent looking table for less than $100. This one fit the bill. It is the perfect finish and price. Easy to put together and stable. Would definately recommend.
5,Good quality item!,I found the quality to be very good as well as the packaging was sufficient to protect the item in transit.
4,Great for the price,"I bought this to serve as a night stand in a small space and I have to say that it has worked perfectly. For the very cheap price, it's really nice. The table goes together easily and quickly and feels sturdy. It's the perfect size and the drawer is useful. The one down-side is that the drawer isn't on runners, which means it ""dropps"" a little when you open it. I wish I had gotten this years ago- it's pretty, you can't beat the price and the function is great."
4,Not a bad deal,"Ordered these tables on sale, so I'd say they were a pretty good deal. They were a little time consuming to put together, and I one of the pieces broke but I was able to secure it with a small wood screw. They serve my purpose fine, and the drawers work pretty well for not being on tracks. I'm currently using them as nightstands but the good thing about these tables is that the backs are finished so they don't have to be against a wall."
4,Very happy,"Very happy with this table, easy to put together, feels pretty sturdy, doesn't look cheap. Only dislike is the bottom of the drawer is a little cheap, but overall I'm very pleased."
5,beats expectations - retail store would pay 3 x price,"with free shipping and fast delivery - very pleased. I bought 2 of themsolid product , although no solid wood, sturdy, perfect height and size for most couches and very good looking , quality finish. expect to pay two or three times the price in a bricks and mortar store"
4,You get what you pay for.,Not bad for the price. Came with some scratches and the parts don't fit perfect in some places. But it works and if you don't point the scratches out to anyone then no one is the wiser.
5,Good value,"This is a very inexpensive night table. I paid $32, with free Amazon prime two-day shipping. So I wasn't expecting fine craftsmanship. It is simple construction but assembles easily, is solid, and the finish had no blemishes. The door is loose as another reviewer noted, but not problematic. Excellent value."
3,nice for the price,"nice enough for the price... easy to assemble. However, discovered a ""design flaw"" on one of the 2 that I bought: the section above the drawer but below the tabletop didn't fit properly... in fact, the only way to assemble the table was to have the stained part of that piece face the back --- so from a distance you can see a strip of unstained wood above the drawer."
3,As pictured and reasonably easy to assemble,"The table was exactly as pictured. Two points about assembly that were not perfect, despite overall assembly being very easy: 1. the kit did not come with a Philips-head tool, so I borrowed a similar crank style assembly kit item from the cat tree I recently received as a gift from a friend - which had both a Philips-head and a blunt/square head (I recommend the manufacturer consider including such a tool); 2. some of the screws would not tighten properly and continued to turn and turn, while leaving the surfaces meant to be secured a bit loose. Overall, happy with the purchase my friend made for me, using my wish list."
4,Pretty Awesome,"This is a pretty nice piece. Assembly was easy; however, I used my own screws since the ones given were nearly immposiable to put in. The coor works great with the rest of my furniture. Overall, it is a simply pleasant nightstand. Had some nicks in it. I'm guessing from shipping, not too sure though."
3,Nightstand Review,"This nightstand is very suitable for my needs. A little larger would have been nice but it serves its purpose. The color is true to its ""Walnut"" description."
4,Handsome furniture but some assembly challenges,"We decided to assemble this ourselves, and once we acquired a powered screw driver most of it went very easily. However, putting the knob on the drawer did not. Still, this is a handsome, sturdy, small night table at a very good price."
4,good deal for the price,"Overall we're happy with this nightstand, it's got a nice design with the drawer and bottom shelf, it's small enough to fit in tight places but has enough space to fit a bedlight, book, keys, clock, etc. We noticed the wood scratches pretty easily, but for only $40 a piece, we can't complain too much."
4,very happy with purchase,Not perfect but a great piece of furniture for the price. I would buy it again.
3,Not too bad for the price.....,"Went together fine, except the drilling was a bit off for the side pieces into one of the framing pieces. That was solved using some larger all purpose self tapping screws, an easy fix. Other than that, it is alright."
3,order sets at the same time,I actually like the product but I ordered two Walnut accent tables at different times and the colors DO NOT match. One is more espresso and the other more Cherry but both were marked Walnut.
2,"OK design, poor quality",I assembled this in about an hour. The night stand looks decent but it is shaky and poorly constructed. The holes of the various pieces didn't always match with so a few of the screws needed to be inserted askew which compromises its balance. Worth spending a few more dollars for something with better quality control.
2,Manufacturer needs to improve quality control.,"The first time I purchased this table, it was a beautiful dark tobacco/espresso color. I loved it so much that 5 days later, I ordered another so I could use them as nightstands in my bedroom. However, I was so disappointed when the second table arrived and it was about 10 shades lighter--more of a maple color. I sent it back because it matched nothing in my house. I ordered another to see if, by chance, the color would be closer to the first table. No luck...returning this one too. I'll put the dark table that I like in the spare bedroom and head out to the furniture store to find tables that actually match."
1,Very unstable and shaky table,"I completed assembling the table exactly the way as instructed in the manual. The final completed table was very shaky and unstable. It shakes like a pendulum. I am very upset with this product.I had spent 2 hrs assembling this night table but the final product was completely unsatisfactory. The table is shaking from two places. One, from the top where the four legs are fixed with the top surface (or the drawer). Second, from the bottom, where the four legs are connected with the lower shelf.With full respect i would request the seller to improve this product.I am planning to throw it away and get a new one from IKEA."
4,Nice little table,"We just got this little table yesterday and put it together. It's pretty nice. It's heavier than I thought it would be and nice and sturdy. The reason it didn't get a 5th star was because the color was a little duller than I was hoping for. Never go by the picture, I guess!"
1,NOT Solid Wood as Described,"This product's description is misleading. It states that it's made of solid wood, but the top, shelf and drawer sides are laminated particle board, and the shelf bottom is paper cardboard! I ordered two for a guest room, based on the 3 all-wood Winsome Wood Concord tables I'd bought recently; as soon as I opened the first box and encountered the parts, back it went into the box and was returned to Amazon."
3,Cute table,"The assembly instructions don't waste words - there are none, just diagrams. Make sure the drawer is in place before inserting the drawer stop."
4,Nice for the price.,"Easy to assemble, looks good (for the price), very solid. Not the Ritz, but works well for our guest room."
2,Winsome Wood Accent Table,This table appears to be very cheaply constructed. It does work as small bedside table but probably would not take a lot of wear and tear.
4,Great end table for the money,"Compact and a bit of a pain to assembly (think IKEA furniture), but for the price you cannot beat it. Still using in my living room today and looks great from the outside. The drawer is a little wobbly, so if you envision a high use drawer, you might need to reconsider. If you are looking for something to store remotes when not in use, this will fit the bill. It is just under a standard windowsill height so won't hog the living room. Good product, great price."
5,Easy to put together.,I usually make my husband assemble any kind of furniture that we get. However after reading the reviews I decided to try it myself. It was very easy. I had it together in about 20 minutes. The directions were easy to follow. I really love the color I got the Walnut and it's not as dark as it looks in the picture.
2,Not solid wood !,Both the top and the bottom are particle board with wood veneer.I'm very dissatisfied. I don't like being lied to by Amazon.
4,Winsome Wood Night Stand,"I'm just going to confirm what previous reviewers have already written. This table is NOT made out of real wood! The drawer is not tall at all, which seriously limits it's usefulness. It also angles down way too much when you pull it out. When I finished assembling it, it would not stand perfectly flat on my hardwood floor. It was close, though, and when I put it in my carpeted bedroom, it didn't matter.I used a ratcheting T-handle screwdriver to assemble it. With the included Allen wrench and a conventional Phillips head screwdriver, it would have been doable but considerably harder.On the plus side, no parts were missing as shipped. Nothing was broken in shipping, and it arrived quickly. I felt the parts lined up together well. I think it looks pretty good for the price. It also seems sturdy enough. I'm satisfied with my purchase."
3,Color is off,"The table is of decent quality but the color was nothing like the photo. There must be lots of irregularities between them because I relied on posts of others saying it was dark and ""espresso"" which is what I wanted. What I got was a much lighter color. I decided to keep it even tho it wasn't as pictured but keep in mind that you may not get the color as pictured."
1,Walnut Color in no way resembles picture,"Quality here is shoddy (screws do not fit into predrilled holes, etc), and most importantly, the picture of this product makes it look like the ""walnut"" is a fairly dark color. It is not. In no way, shape or form does the actual color of the product resemble the picture. The actual color is far lighter. Will be returning and purchasing a different product elsewhere. Buyer beware."
2,"""Walnut"" finish is actually ""Cherry""","This is the first time I have written a review for an Amazon purchase. I decided to write one this time because I don't want others to fall into the same trap. The ""walnut"" finish table is NOT walnut --> it's CHERRY. Also, the top of the table was a lighter shade than the rest of the pieces. I am returning this product for a refund."
3,Not as dark as advertised. Useless Drawer.,"It is a a medium shade of brown instead of what appears to be a dark brown. Drawer is mostly useless, it doesn't have runners and starts to tilt downward as soon as the drawer is half way pulled out. Only thing keeping the drawer in is a little wooden insert. Overall it is a little unstable too as it does rock a bit even with every screw fully tightened. Instructions are really vague but the pre-drilled holes are precise. Materials used are solid wood and it doesn't look terrible but I don't particularly recommend it. Guess this is what you get for the price but I was still expecting more."
3,Not too bad for the price,"I'll start off by saying this table is not too bad for the price. It arrived broken, so I needed to customize it with some ingenuity and a screw. The side panels are a different color stain than the top, drawer and shelf. When the drawer is closed there's too large of a gap between the top front edge of the drawer and the top of the table. Overall I'm happy because of the low price."
5,Accent Table,"I purchased two Winsome Wood Accent Tables in Walnut. They were easy to put together, they're attractive, functional, and a great buy. Table top area is large enough to accommodate a lamp. Wonderful as inexpensive end tables for living room or use as bedroom nightstands."
4,A good table for a good price,"This is a good, basic table. I have two serving as nightstands next to my bed. They were delivered in a few days, as promised. I assembled each one in under an hour. I would buy these again."
4,TOM in Manassas,"A very nice table. Assemble was easy, with the exception of the plug that keeps the drawer from falling out. Also the farther you pull the drawer out the more it sags down. This can be fixed by gluing a couple of pieces of wood to the inside frame of the nightstand."
2,Not SOLID BEECHWOOD! It's particle board.,It's not SOLID BEECHWOOD. It's particle board. What a pain. Now I have to decide whether to return it or not.
2,You get what you pay for,"I was very disappointed with this item. First off, my drawer was very hard to assemble because the slits in the wood did not match up well. Secondly, the coating scratches very easily.I would not buy this product again, but I can't be bothered to send it back."
1,Not worth the money,"Very complicated to assemble especially for people like me who are challenged when it comes to this type of assembling, the instructions were also not clear. I tried and after 30 mins, it felt like I have destroyed the piece. There were mismatched coloration on some of the pieces. It's so not worth the cheap price. After an hour, I decided to fold and just not even both with getting the money back by returning, went to Pier 1 Imports and bought a $140 night stand, which saved me the headache and hassles.The picture looks really good, but unfortunately, I couldn't even put it together, but materials felt/looked cheap and flimsy, and NOt sturdy at all."
1,"Take heed seller, this is why I did not purchase this item","I am in the market for several end tables for nursing homes. This end table fits my needs and budget perfectly. However, Customer Service is most important to me. I would rather pay more for the product to be able to contact the seller when I have a problem, especially if it is a manufactures problem. Because I did not find ONE customer that had something positive to say about the customer service, I did not purchase this item from this company. I wonder how many other sales this customer would have if they only would stand behind their product. PS Sellers better take heed on these comments if they expect to survive."
2,Not that good,Its not that good. The top part broke when I was assembling it. Otherwise it is small and it would have done the job.
3,Decent but not all well made,"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with it. It looks alright, stands up straight, and does its job.The drawer in mine came in crooked, but it's not noticeable unless you're going to be using it a lot."
4,Nice table,This is a nice little table. Solid wood with an attractive finish. Minus one star for no drawer glides. I will make my own. BL
2,Waaaayyy lighter in color than shown....,"Ugh. I spent hours trying to find a decent looking nightstand with decent reviews that was decently priced, and finally settled on this. I was prepared for the sagging drawer (which is 100% true -- the drawer sags pretty badly), but wasn't prepared for the color it actually is! It is WAY lighter than pictured! More of a light-medium brown than a darker brown. I'm trying to transition all my furniture to be a darker brown, and these in no way fit the bill. Unfortunately, my boyfriend assembled them and threw away the boxes while I was out of town, so now we're stuck with them.... Otherwise these would have immediately gone back. As it is, I'm so unhappy with the color that as soon as we can I'd like to buy completely different nightstands and just try to sell these on eBay.Decent little stand for the price I guess, but don't plan on it being anywhere close to the color in the picture -- and know that the drawer is really really saggy."
5,Easy to assemble and looks great,Bought these as bed side nightstands and they work perfectly. The assembly was easy and everything fits together nicely. They seem to have a nice finish on them that is difficult to scratch.
3,"great little table, not the color shown in the picture","I love the size of this table. It works great for what I need it for. I bought it to put in my baby's nursery to go w/ the espresso crib set. Anyways, dark walnut is usually really dark and should have matched perfect. Well, I don't think they put enough coats of the stain on, or didn't let it set long enough before using a rag because it is a light brown. Luckily since it is real wood I can sand it down & restain it with a darker brown color so it matches the crib furniture. If the crib would have arrived first I would have returned it...but since I got the table first, put it together and then the crib came, I don't feel like pulling it apart and sending it back. The colored pictured (dark walnut) is no where near the color that mine arrived in. It isn't natural, black or white...instead a light brown."
5,Awesome tables!!,"I bought 2 of these tables on the recommendations of other buyers who were pleased with the product. I was not disappointed! These tables were fairly easy to put together and they look fantastic in my living room. They are real wood, not particle board. The price was very good. I highly recommend them."
2,Ok for the price,"This night stand was the best value I could find during my internet search. Once I received the pair I had ordered and put them together, I thought that they were okay for the price. However, they are a bit shorter/smaller than I would have liked. They work for a temporary fix, but would suggest they be more for a child's room, not for an adult's. Otherwise, good material use. Some minor flaws, but over all you get what you pay for."
4,Good night stand for platform bed,"Packaging aside, assembly was not that bad. The ""tool"" included would be best replaced with a hex wrench with a handle (available at your local home improvement store), and you will need a phillips #2.The two I ordered were color matched and had no notable finish flaws."
2,Cheap unprofessional stain,The night stand is sturdy and easy to put together but I noticed a terrible inconsistency in the color/stain throughout the legs after assembling. I am using it for an area in my room that is not very noticible or else I would return it. I will not ever purchase furniture online like this again. I did not really notice the poor color/stain quality until after I put it together and the light hit it a certain way. Even for this price I would not recommend it especially if it will be right next to your bed and noticable. Check each piece in the light and sunlight BEFORE you put it together. duh !
4,good value,Good quality for the money spent. A drawback is the cheap wooden knob on the drawer. This was easily remedied by going to the hardware store and purchasing a nice ceramic knob to replace it.
2,A Lot Lighter Brown Than The Pics,"I've got a couple of their pieces, and this finish doesn't match the others in Walnut at all, it's many shades lighter in color. Other than that, it went together fairly simply, and seems to be pretty solid. It's all pressed board with veneer, I suppose to be expected as about as cheap as it gets."
2,not the color it appears,"After getting the pieces out and my son putting them together for us while we were out, and tossing the boxes out - I find that these tables are NOT the color they appear. I bought these to match 2 other pieces that are darker woods, and this is NOT a dark wood. Very disappointed - don't want to bother taking them apart and finding boxes for them to ship back. very disappointed with this item and this being my 2nd purchase from Amazon, I will be careful next time"
4,"Stout Little Table! Cheap Drawer, Though.","I bought this end table for the refurb of my office I undertook a few months back. It fits the new decor perfectly.Assembly was uncomplicated, and the instructions and parts were all included and properly drilled. I've had no issues with the finish scratching or anything else with the fit and finish of the kit.The one exception is the design of the drawer. In lieu of any rails keeping the drawer on a path, there's just an opening and a peg to insert so the drawer won't fall out when extended too far. Cheap! Still, it looks good when closed, and as a table the unit works well and looks good.I might have subtracted two stars for the wonky drawer design, but it looks so good and is so sturdy I'll keep it at four."
3,its OK>,"i ordered this for our bedroom.. it came with no instruction. was kind of confusing.. quality of the wood is not great.. if your looking for something cheap, this can do it .. else find something better"
3,The drawer started falling appart on one of them after a year.,"I bought two of them since they were cheap. I assembled them myself, but a while back, I pulled on the drawer of the one I used more often and face came off. You get what you pay for. That's that awful truth. I can live with it because if something breaks on me, I have a tendency to fix it myself. If you don't mind gluing this back together later on, then go for it. If you don't want to deal fixer-up issues, invest in something of better.They are not as glossy as they look in the picture, but they do just fine for me."
2,Poor Quality construction despite nice design,"I purchased 2 of these tables recently and they both had serious defects. Scratches, rough spots, inconsistent finish between top and sides, much lighter finish on sides than top, spots where staining was skipped, some wooden parts split in drawer when fasteners are tightened, etc.I asked for replacements and they arrived with worse flaws so I combined parts to get 2 barely acceptable tables to use in dimly lit room. I returned the other two. Previous reviews were good so I think the manufacturer sent AMAZON a bad batch recently made with very poor craftsmanship. They are not worth the problems at any price now since they are all defective."
5,the best of the best,"That book is an excellent example of a book that the student of animal industry in my university need to take the classes. It is a complete component in wish the student can find all things about the animals physiology, reproduction and management. I'm student on animal industry and I hope that in my university take my suggest of giving this book like a referen for all the courses in wish more kind of animal themes are develop. Surely, I hope that the book have the sucess that it deserve because I see that is a complete book and is a perfect base or fundament for the student. This book Animal sciences and industry answer more common questions of the student who begin in this area and for the students who interest in study any relate area."
3,Expand your understanding of numbers and nature,"I don't imagine that ""Mastering Technical Mathematics"" will wind up on the top of anyone's book list. But if you have an interest in math the book can expand your understanding of numbers from counting through geometry and trig on to the calculus. If you're looking for a book to get you through next weeks' test on logarithms I'd stick with a Schaum's Outline but if you really want to know what a logarithm is and how they are derived, how they are applied, and how they can make your life easier, well, all of that is found here.It's not all easy going. Like all math, each part is built on an understanding of the previous part (precisely why I failed intermediate algebra!) Some of the concepts can be hard to understand, too. But as you work though each chapter and, especially if you work through the problems, you'll gain a deeper understanding of numbers and how they relate to nature."
5,Be Careful in Your Cabin...Guaranteed to Cause Spring Fever!,"This book is the age-old story of winter's end and the glad return of spring. It takes place at that one magical turning-point that comes every year when suddenly you notice spring has crept in and claimed the earth again. Most of the action takes place after sundown of the last day of winter. During the quiet night that follows spring unfolds and we are involved in the lovely stirrings of a greening world and her wild creatures. The lyrical text entices our senses to rise and remember spring. We are treated to very, very beautiful illustrations just filled with subtle and exquisite light from sunset to sunrise, to starry full-moon skies and soft lamplit lanes in the park. This book is a jewel and it will either make you long for spring or tide you over until it returns."
1,BUYER BEWARE ! !,Same part number as the LUK brand - 11-011 - I bought the LUK part from Part Geeks and it did not fit my car. It took a month to get most of my money back and was a real pain overall. I had to pay shipping both ways.
5,Movie FOR the heart,"This movie was utterly stunning. We had read the story for Christmas every year, and when we found out there was a movie for it, we were amazed. Sam Hennings did a tremendous job as the father, and the mother also-OF COURSE so did the little boy!!I couldn't help from crying over and over because the movie was so touching and plays with your emotions greatly.It starts out as when a mother and father, now parentless because of the death of their two daughters, are given a boy to take care of around the age of seven or eight. The father begins to love the boy, but how can the mother when her two beautiful daughters are dead? Always turning cold towards the boy, the mother doesn't know how to love him....but then again...hearts can be mended in Seasons of the Heart."
2,Seasons of the heart,"I personally did not care for this movie. It was boring and very slow. I love these kind of movies, but, this one I did not like."
5,Very suspenseful!!,"Dr. Rawling's book was great, although I wished the ending had been different. However, the detail about the confederacy was extremely detailed and interesting. I can tell he did a ton of research on that."
5,The Perfect Recipe,"The Rutherford Cipher has the perfect blend of Southern charm, history, adventure, suspense and intrigue. The plot possesses a sheer magnetism that embraced me and held me in it's clutches til the very end. I have to admit that I didn't want the tale to end. I enjoyed the complex relationships of the charaters in the tale. I live in a nearby hamlet of Walkersville and can testify that this book is both credible and conveivable.Enjoy!"
4,The Rutherford Cipher,"This was a very enjoyable book. Not only is Wm. Rawlings a wonderful Physician, he is a very gifted writer."
4,You'll love this 'game',"'Existenz' has been done before. Totall Recall and The Game are just two recent examples where the film's protagonists are caught up in a mind-spinning set of circumstances where they begin to doubt their actions, motives and even themselves! What Existenz has going for it is comical and deadpan humour. I can remember some parts of the film where I laughed out loud and was then unsure of whether I was supposed to. Jennifer Jason Leigh and up-and-comer Jude Law are great. Obviously shot with a low buget but despite this, the production values are solid. I enjoyed 'Existenz'. You will too. Expect to laugh."
4,Imaginative futuristic Virtual Reality game within a game,"eXistenz is a uniquely architected thriller. It will keep you guessing at what you can't imagine will happen next. Keeping you, as well as some of the characters in the dark as to what is real and what is unreal. You are forced to follow the plot as it develops as you are being plunged into scenarios in which nothing makes immediate sense and always takes another scene to figure out. The acting is excellent . Jennifer Jason Leigh is a perfect personality for her character at once innocent and covertely knowing much more.Sara Polley is also perfect as an innocent who in time accepts his role in eXistenz. All very good with the proverbial twist at the end.Also there are some really yukky scenes that test your tolerance for Yuk."
4,Cronenberg takes the red pill.,"Cronenberg's last ""Cronenberg film"". The plot gets more tangled, twisty and surreal the further down the rabbit hole of ""game levels"" this allegorical sci fi tale for the video game era goes. Its conception predates ""Inception"" by more than a decade but when you think about it, it's part of a larger panoply of real-versus-the-dream movies going all the way back to ""The Wizard of Oz"". If you're completing your collection of Cronenberg movies - or your collection of ""head"" movies - you can't forget this one."
3,Decent Sci-Fi escapism,"It's a fun movie, that has it's moments, but it just didn't click for me. It doesn't help that it starts to lose steam towards the end.But never the less like all of Cronenberg's movie's, it's certainly worth a look."
3,eXistenZ,"At first sight, the pod looks horrible and squeashy. At the end of the show, I am left baffled by the character asking whether they are still in the game or not. That's the general feeling of this movie. One just doesn't know whether the game is still on or off, and if still on, on which dimension and how far advanced the players are in the game. It is an eerie thought that someday, maybe, those gamers out there might just slip into the gaming world and never ever return to the real world. Splendid performances from Jennifer and Jude. I find the movie a little too gory and violent, without a clear sense of direction or purpose. Plugging the pod to the spine is both horrifying and scary."
3,not the best work by Cronenberg,"I like David Cronenberg movies. But this one was quite disappointing. I didn't look at the year the movie was created and thought that it's some earlier Cronenberg' work so undeveloped the movie was. It turned out the movie was made in 1999. Although the spirit and environment of the movie is typical Cronenberg, the plot is hardly original, chaotic and not convincing (and it doesn't mean that I don't like complicatedly structured movies). The only bright spot is the acting (as always) of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law."
3,Interesting to compare to The Matrix,"eXisteZ invites comparison to The Matrix, another movie that explores questions about what is real raised by recent advances in virtual reality technology. eXistenZ is fascinated by the question of what is real, but has no plot velocity to keep the viewer interested in the outcome. The Matrix, a more traditional Hollywood movie, has a structure that keeps you engaged. Overall, eXistenZ is worth seeing; but, unlike The Matrix, it is not worth seeing again."
5,If you like sci-fi you'll love this,"I recently saw this movie. I had not even heard of it but after watching it ranks in my top 5 favorite movies, EVER. It keeps the ""is this real or am I dreaming"" type storyline throughout keeping you on the edge of your seat in suspence to the very end. Highly recomend it!"
2,Watch Videodrome instead,"eXistenZ is a shallower reworking of Cronenberg's earlier work and succeeds only in bringing the ideas into line with the more modern technology. Videodrome is more intelligent and far more atmospheric while James Woods' role in the lead is far more involving. I became somewhat depressed watching this film because it looked very much like Cronenberg had run out of ideas. One other thing - I've always liked the ending to Cronenberg's films, but the line 'Are we still in the game?' is really laying it on with a trowel."
1,Actually that's a NEGATIVE FIVE STARS,"This movie is absolutely horrid. All of the imagery and sound effects are disgusting, the acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous. I REALLY wanted to leave the theatre but I just had to see what else they would do, that's how bad it was. It was sooo cheezy! Like when he yells out ""eXistenZ....is paused!"" my buddy and I burst out laughing. Please do not waste your money on this movie. If you're tempted to buy it and haven't seen it yet, go spend the $4 to rent it first--you'll be disappointed, I guarantee it."
3,Could have been better,"It's hard to rate this movie, especially without giving away any plot spoilers (which has to do with periods of bad acting). However it's a fun ride, yet it feels as though the whole ""game world"" wasn't as fully explored as it could have been. A few scenes, namely the ""Chinese Waiter"" one, are fantastic, while some are boring...like the car ride in the beginning. The plot itself is pretty easy to understand once you watch the movie twice, or just pay attention the first time. This is no Matrix, and it should hardly be compared to it (I'm not saying The Matrix is good or bad: the only thing these movies have in common is the ability to link up into a fictional world). I bought this as a blind buy and was slightly dissapointed...especially after watching Crash. Check out Equilibrium as well."
2,Blooper!,"No, no, no! I'm so sorry for all the FuzZ about this title! It is too Short and too Shallow for a film of the kind. Before one even fully realises the atmosphere it's all over...Miles away from Matrix, there is simply no comparison. Not worth the bucks!"
2,The Matrix Childsplay?,What were those reviewers thinking when they said that?The whole movie is based on a completely different story. And this pod thing you plug into your back? It seemded like it was a plasic bag filled with water with a little string attached.Jennifer Jason Leigh should take some more acting lessons cause well.. she isn't that convincing..
1,A waste of money,"I really wasted my money on this item and the only reason why I got it is because it said that this movie was better than the Matrix Reloaded, well, someone lied to me, at least I was able to trade it back in to amazon for something..."
2,Another Matrix-wannabe clone...,"Well, all the ""makes the matrix look like child's play"" and ""thumbs up"" dont really apply here... I mean - it's a nice movie, completely weird and it really gives you no clue or room to speculate on what's going on; but then again it doesnt show anything new..."
3,It's so-so,"I had high expectation about eXistenZ based on some critical reviews. The movie is simply average. The bizarre start of the movie already undermines any pretention of reality. The weird gun idea is a stale device from countless alternate-universe sci-fi stories. Used in virtual-reality story, it reinforces the early suspicion that something is not quite right about reality. The audience is then shown a bunch of strange virtual reality jumps that make no sense. The surprises were telegraphed way earlier in the movie. So after a little while, there is little to care about, leaving us time to marvel the last gunfight scene's cheesiness (a smaller scale confrontation would likely work better.) The worst thing about this movie, however, is the lack of memorable characters. It's trouble when the only thing you remember clearly after seeing the movie is that strange rubbery thing with nipples. At the very least The Matrix gives us Trinity to dream about :-)."
1,eXistenZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Has to be, no it is, the worst DVD I bought so far. I fell asleep twice due to the poor acting and lack of interesting screenplay. I don't understand how The San Francisco Chronicle claims this movie ""Makes The Matrix Look Like Child's Play."" The Matrix sets a standard for all other movies to strive for. eXistenZ is highly recommended to cure insomnia."
1,I expected better!,"I rented this just because there was nothing left to rent, and I must say...I am surprised at how poorly the acting is in this movie. The whole movie was lacking and not very entertaining. I do not recomend this at all."
1,Best bit is the movie trailor!,If you've seen the movie trailor then you've seen the best bits of the movie.The rest is of it is just garbage. I was very dissapointed.
1,Zero stars!,"What an awful, awful movie. Its only redeeming feature was that it was under two hours long, thereby wasting less of my life.How disappointing that Amazon requires one to give it any stars at all."
2,Cronenberg after Dead Ringers?,"All you need to see from Cronenberg is his films through the film Dead Ringers. He created a unique genre of horror films, many of which remain a masterpiece to this day(The Fly), (Dead Zone), however, all of his work after the 80's, just like John Carpenter, seems very uninspired. This film is not horrible, its just boring and predictable."
2,eXistenZ worth it?,"Normally, i would not go to a movie like this, but by accident we were confronted with it. While technically there is some beauty, even probably new visual content to it, the story was not understandable to me. The mood in it was like a bad dream, fear and desperation reigned. By the end of the movie, i wanted to immediately forget about this experience. Depression is not a particularly creative expression. By flashing back, i only could feel sorry for the wasted talent of the persons involved with production and execution, and the finances withhold for more significant and enlightening projects."
1,Awfull at every level starting with script!,"No wonder Alliance shares are not doing well (the Canadian film company which made this movie). It only proves that Alliance should do what it can do well - distribute Hollywood movies. If you liked Matrix you'll hate this film. Heck, if you like movies you'll hate this pile of esoteric rubbish!"
1,Who wrote this?,"Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law have more talent than many actors, who conviced them to do this junk? From the first moment to the last one I couldn't understand the story, full of creatures, strange people, jumps in time and in places and creepy dialogues. What is an actor like Willem Dafoe doing in this movie? It seems the screenplayer wrote the story in one weekend or they didn't paid him. Save your oney for better movies."
1,diSturbinG,"The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is not the worst movie I have ever seen. If you enjoy seeing people put their tounges in holes in other people's backs, this movie may be for you."
1,This isn't a good movie!!!,"Well I saw this movie and it's just horrible. What the heck is supposed to be going on in this movie. There is a whole lot of bizarre stuff, and it all amounts to a whole ton of stupidity.The whole idea about this movie is that everything is in the ""video game world."" Well this video game world is so freaking dumb, it makes absolutely no sense and it all adds up to an annoying, frustrating film."
4,Great movie!,"I thought the movie eXistenZ rocked! I had read several other people's revies, and I did not think that the dialogue was as horrible as everyone was saying. The few ""cheesy"" lines in the movie made sense because they were in a game. Anyway, the movie was good and worth the money I spent to rent it and the actors were great."
4,If you're want a no-brainer get The Matrix,"I'm not a huge Cronenburg fan. I thought Scanners was a laugh, but found the rest of his work to be too self indulgent or just plain overrated (The Fly). But Existenz is an exception. He has managed to make an intelligent and accessible film. It has surprisingly few special effects. Instead it relies on subtlety. Slowly bringing the characters and the viewer, to a point where it's no longer possible to discern what is real. OK the ending is a tad cheesy. But so what, when the rest is so enjoyable! Quite simply it's the most satisfying SC-FI I've seen this year. If you like Gattaca, this may be your cup of tea. But, as you probably can tell by some of the other reviews, if you're expecting non-stop action - you WILL be disappointed."
3,It was ok.,"I thought this film was ok. Not great, not bad, just ok. It was just a little slow in parts. The overall concept was great, however. I could have done without the back installation imagery. Worth renting, sure. Buying? Maybe if you are a huge Chronenberg fan or if you have money to burn. I just don't think it will hold up to repeated viewings."
4,imaginative and the end is a surprise,"its quite a movie. Jennifer Jason Leigh creates a game called eXistenZ and you can tap in threw the back or the bellybutton, one of the two, anyway, at the beginning, a man trys to assassinate her but luckily Jude Law brings her to safety and tries to save her, then a man named Gas trys to kill her, played by Willem Dafoe and then he gets killed. they start tapping into the game and experience reality bending things. imaginative soup gun in that chinese restautant and the end is a twist which it turns out to be an actual game hey are all playing and the 2 are actually assassins themselves. other cast members like Don McKellar(Exotica) with a funked up part, Sarah Polley(GO, The Claim), Ian Holm(The Fifth Element) and Christopher Eccelston(Shallow Grave, Jude, 28 Days Later), add spark to the interesting piece, I read the book and David Cronenberg did an excellent job on the movie as well."
4,The Matrix it ain't,"Instead of the gee-whiz techie approach so common in the sci-fi genre, Cronenberg takes a decidely minimilastic approach in this film. Everything from lighting to props to sound to the backdrop of the film itself (out in the country instead of bustling, congested urban landscape) is ""o-tech""in nature Of course the usual Cronenberg body-manipulation themes are in this film (via the ""io-ports"". BTW, I liked the Matrix very much. I was just comparing. :)"
2,"Good idea, low budget, bad acting.","David C. is good for finding out and melting together good concepts - biological games, man hunting, integrism - but the overall result is poor. eXistenZ definitely lacks depth and grandeur, it is no thrilling at all, and because acting is so lame (disappointing because the same actors prove they could be better) you feel no sympathy for the ""heroes"". Finally, the future described here has nothing to do with Matrix or Blade Runner ; it is perfectly standard by all means. The story could happen anywhere in our present (given the ridiculous and badly realized ""Bio Pods""). It certainly helped to cut off costs but do not expect to find pictures of a thrilling too-near future. Plot, qualities and drawbacks remind me of Nirvana (C. Lambert). Rent it before buying."
4,Big Surprise,"I was drug to the theater at 12 at night to see this. I never even heard of Cronenberg. Big Surprise, I was into this thing start to finish. I thought the Matrix was horrible and after I saw this I thought, ""now thats a real story."" ... If you watch this you'll see how unpredictable everything turns out. Jude Law is excellent in this. If you liked him in AI you'll see but another great execution by him. The chinese resturaunt scene is hilarious. Classic! This movie is great and will be your little secret since not to many people have even heard of it.4 stars because I hear the Canadien version has bonus material. Theres none on the US version."
2,I was expecting more...,"This movie appeared to be very inventive, like it was going somewhere. I kept hoping something would happen...but it never did. I just...I don't know. There was too much lakcing in this movie. Jude Law was really good in this movie...or so I thought. But Leigh wasn't all that great. This movie just didn't do it for me. I was unimpressed. Especially with the end."
5,One of the Best Films of 1999,"I love David Cronenberg's universe. Is bizarre and strange, but very atractive. His stories caught the audiences and carry them through a world with a lot of madness and sick peoples. Only remember masterpieces like The Fly, Dead Ringers and Crash. This major film, also, present greats actors: Jennifer Jason Leigh is disturb and sensual and Jude Law looks like a weak and innocent child involved in a wacky world. Like The Matrix, other great science fiction film, eXistenZ shows, and mix, a real and virtual world, but without great special effects. In fact, Cronenberg make a perfect film with pure talent. All his universe is present in eXistenZ, maybe some people like it and others not, but this is not a reason to say, eXistenZ is a boring and bad film. I think is a new masterpiece by David Cronenberg. I wait his next movie with a lot of enthusiasm."
2,Definetly not better than Matrix,Visual effects are okay but for a DVD movie when your talking sound effects its not worth buying. I wish I could've exchange it for a better movie with good acting and storyline. Don't let the cover fool you.
2,as cronenberg as you can get,"As a cronenberg's fan I was disappointed with this one. The story is not that great but the visual is so bloody cronenberg. Some scenes might be disturbing to some people, but to cronenberg 's fans its pleasing. By the way, the weapon is so cool."
3,There is nothing wrong with your television...,"Hey, that was a pretty cool episode of ""The Outer Limits"" -Oh wait, eXistenZ was a movie? Aren't movies supposed to have special effects, bigger budgets and better acting? My bad. eXistenZ is pretty thought provoking, but you are SO much better off watching ""Strange Days"" instead."
3,Jennifer Jason Leigh makes it worth it,"Baaaaad script, but weird enough to keep you going. A little scattered and with large pieces that are needed to understand what's what missing from the film entirely. Still, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Willem Defoe, make it worth watching. Good actors are worth their weight in gold ... or at least in bad scripts."
1,Make It Stop!,"After watching this excuse for a movie, I really felt like calling up Cronenberg and asking for an hour and 1/2 of my life back.What could have been an interesting premise goes nowhere, with a couple of actors that are totally wooden in these roles.The script is supposed to pass for ""complex"", but what it really is is shoddy writing and story structure. Someone needs a remedial english class.If you liked ""The Matrix"", and I did, don't waste your time with this waste of celluloid..."
1,Confusing title,"Please note that this movie has nothing to do with those pills you see advertised on late night TV. :(ExtenZe Male Enhancement, 30-Count Box"
1,"Holy clunker of a film, Batman!","I was seriously shocked at how leaden and uninteresting this film was. I've been a fan of Cronenberg for many years and have liked quite a few of his films. I've also always respected Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. This film, though, was laughable. The dialogue was awkward, the acting was empty and the story was just strange without creating anything intruiging. I cannot believe the people writing reviews comparing this to The Matrix and calling it a ""smarter version"". Smarter how? Not even close. and the Matrix is not even a great film in it's own right - but compared to this, it is. A better film than both of these (which both films steal from, liberally) is Alphaville. Rent the Criterion edition and you'll know what I mean."
1,"Poor collaboration and props, wooden script","I know half of the people who love Cronenberg will say ""But all of that is part of the plan!"" but seriously, this movie was poorly done. The props looked like something made out of dental mold rubber using a budget of tens of dollars, and the plot simply plods along. Willem Defoe and other named actors spice up the film a bit, but overall, not something I would watch again, even when desperate."
2,GROANIN BERG,"As we are all aware, video games have progressed so far to the point that it doesn't take much imagination to conjure a world where the distinction between reality and game playing could occur. David Cronenberg, whose best film I think, is DEAD ZONE, reverts to his graphic sense of sensationalism to bring us this story about a video game unlike others before. His imagination is to be heralded, what with live pods and stranger things going on with guns that shoot teeth, etc., etc. The problem is the whole thing is so chaotic, tedious and self-serving that EXISTENZ becomes little more than a muddled bore. I wasn't impressed with Jennifer Jason Leigh or Jude Law; they appeared to be acting and not inhabiting their roles at all. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are wasted in their roles and what little special effects there are have been done before and better.I appreciate innovation and creative differences in movies, but they should be a little more cohesive and entertaining than this mess."
2,Not Cronenberg's best,"There have been many comparisons between this movie and The Matrix, but the only similarity is the focus on ultrarelistic virtual reality, perhaps with a bit of ""which is the real world"" ambiguity thrown in. I've been a fan of David Cronenberg for years, but this movie just wasn't up to his considerable par. The themes are fascinating, and the storyline progesses nicely, but the entire feel of the movie left me a little bored. I didn't really care whether or not the characters were able to do what they had to do, even when that included Jude Law eating a double headed lizard, which should have been disgustingly interesting. I'll keep watching Cronenberg, and you may want to check this one out, but go into it with no expectations. You might enjoy it more that way."
3,dissapointing effort,"Cronenberg usually always satisfies, but existenz just doesnt quite do it. Its entertaining mostly, but the ending is such a cheat it leaves you feeling empty, or is that what its supposed to do. Too much rehashing of ideas from videodrome, reality merges with fantasy, organic gun technology etc. I hope cronenberg has not lost his touch and will return to form. The novelisation is much more entertaining, and adds a line of dialogue at the end that makes the whole thing more worthwhile; ""we're still in the game arn't we?"" ""Who knows?"""
2,Low budget?,"The story had good potential, but seemed way too low budget -- the pods had a very unsophisticated outer shell, etc. Also, the acting, or rather overacting, left something to be desired. The ending was a complete disappointment."
2,poor,"this movie is poor-bad acting, disgusting scenes and very little believable. Leigh's character in particular is very annoying. try Strange Days instead."
5,"Phenomenal film, despite the director...","The film has a plot that is much more accessible than most others by Cronenberg. I was hesitant to watch this film after Crash, which I herald as one of the most painful films to watch--ever. This movie incorporates elements of action with suspense, all the while requiring you to think about the events that were transpiring. You begin to wonder yourself, where the two leads began the game, and how their actions (crimes) affected them [they themselves were unsure at points in the movie]. It was great and grows more interesting with subsequent viewings."
2,One WEIRD movie,"My roomate and I watched this movie, and we turned it off after the first 30 minutes because it was like stupid. But we gave it another shot, and in the end, you kinda wonder what happened. The movie starts out really slow, and just starts throwing in characters, so after a while, you start losing track of who is who. This movie pretty much sucked until the end, when you find out what the movie was about, and the ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered. This movie HAD some possibilities, but the premise was like WAY too out there, and the script was pretty weak."
1,Maximum disappointment,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A fan of the strange, this movie hooked me in the first few moments with the Kubrick-esque car escape down back country farm roads. I had hope, but alas. . .horrible acting (yes, even by Jude Law. . .why get rid of that glorious accent?) and a story that Croneneberg thought was so very clever. Bad use of over-gratifying sotrytelling devices, relying on the value of shock over defined characters and what about the stupid twist ending? Give me a break. . .would rate it in the negative if I could."
1,THE WORST FILM EVER MADE,"Let's not try and pretend, like most of the other reviews, that this film is at all CLEVER. It's not, it's utter rubbish. The concept is far too similar to 'The Game', the difference being that 'The Game' is a very good film. The acting is wooden, and the characters have to keep explaining what the hell it is they are doing. Imagine 'Star Wars': ""This is your father's Light-sabre Luke, the light comes out of this bit but it doesn't go on and on forever, gradually getting dimmer like normal light, it stops after a while. Also it can cut through things and hurt people which light can't normally do, and.........blah, blah, blah, blah, blah""Cronenberg should be banned from directing and should have to personnaly pay back the money that was WASTED on this boring, rubbish.If you like this film you can help David pay the money back instead of buying the DVD!!"
1,Don't even waste your $$ renting it !,"After seeing 'The Matrix' & 'The 13th Floor' (both ~great sci-fi movies), I had high hopes for eXistenZ. I know that having high hopes going into a movie will cause you to think less of it had you not had those expectations. In this case it wouldn't have mattered - IT WAS TERRIBLE! This was one of those movies that I just couldn't wait for it to end. The only reason that I kept watching it was the hope that something in the ending would happen to salvage the whole thing - IT DIDN'T! I rate the movies I've seen this year, and this was 3rd from last (ahead of 'The Colony' & 'The Big Labowski'. JUST SAY NO!"
2,Really disgusting,"This movie made me feel sick!Whatever world the characters are in there are always bodyparts laying around, being cut, destroyed or disected (and I don't mention the mutant amphibians that finish in a repulsive chinese dish and that get eaten!). There is no sense in the story, it's just about killing people without understanding why. The characers try to explain it, but you get so confused with all this non-sense! Forget reflecting, just turn off the TV. The best part of this movie is the end which could be described as quite good (when they're back to reality).I liked the cast, especialy Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, who played quite well (I really hope they didn't choose to play in this movie or I'd be concerned)I really regret the movie being so bad, I could have enjoyed it if there had been less meaningless violence and less disgusting body parts."
1,Most bizzare film of all time winner.,"I have to say that I am astonished to see that the general reviews of this film are positive!This is without a doubt high up in the ""nosebleed section"" of my ""I can't believe that someone paid to make this flic let alone pay to see it"" list !It was confusing, disjointed,confusing in the extreme and just plain bad filmmaking.The action is all over the map, the characters are not the least sympathetic enough to be interesting to the viewer and the storyline was likely fleshed out at a evening serving too many halucinatory party favors!Don't even rent this one ... borrow it from someone who believed the other reviews and bought it !"
5,Don't Mess,What a great CD!!! Ozo is never stale.I love the new cuts. If you never seen them live you are missing out!
2,Disappointing,"Per their interview in Paste magazine, Ozomatli set out to make a more commercial, more accessable CD. Most tracks on Don't Mess With The Dragon are clearly aimed at radio play and the club and party crowd. You can't knock them for trying to make some money for a change; we all know how hard that is in the current music biz.I love Street Signs, but this CD is a bit of an embarrasment. Everything is stripped down and simplified. The songs are silly and shallow for the most part. There are couple of OK moments, but after listening to this CD for the second time I felt like I'd heard enough.If you are new to Ozo, skip this and buy Street Signs instead. Now THAT is a great album!"
2,Slouching toward pop - disappointing,"I have been a big fan of Ozomatli since their first CD. I rave about them to all who will listen as most people who love this band do. This CD is indeed the turning point toward pop for this band. There are shades of the old band in some of the songs like La Gallina, or Violeta but most of the stuff is empty. It is like a band trying to cover Ozomatli songs. I am sure that most fans will give this a try in spite of the negative reviews, but for our sake guys don't do this again."
4,Pure Ozo For Better or Worse,"As an L.A. native and fan of Ozo since before their first album, the sound and the fury of the L.A. melange we've come to expect (and enjoy) is definitely there. I see them whenever they're in town. If I have a criticism, it is that the album is largely phoned-in. If you're accustomed to the Ozo sound, it's more of the same. But that's fantastic. Their worst day is better than 90% of most of other contemporary artists.As has been said, Ozo's strength lies in their live performances; there's nothing like the energy of double-digit performers, musicians, and family members on stage, and this album does a great job translating that energy. It's a great pick-me-up, and a great party album. It's a great introduction to the band, and an equal addition to the Ozo library. Just don't expect a whole lot of innovation.Having said that, I'll definitely be singing along to the songs from this album the next time they blow through town...and I'll see you there."
4,This is more mainstream than earlier Ozo,"Which may be why some listeners object. ""Dragon's"" good and it may be their entree into more acknowledgement. ""Street Signs"" is probably my favorite of their CDs and more indicative of their work, but this is still a great melange of a lot of different styles and worth the investment."
5,Practice Makes Perfect is Perfect!,"I'm a MS & HS German teacher and I think this book is a great resource for teaching students or teaching yourself. Each new section begins with an explanation of the grammar concept, followed by several practice exercises. The explanations & exercises are very comprehensive and the answer key is included in the back of the book. I own all three books in the series (Pronouns & Prepositions, Verb Tenses, & Vocabulary) and I recommend them all!"
4,Kindle Edition has Limitation,"For an in depth presentation of German Pronouns and Prepositions, this is an excellent book.My criticism is that in the Kindle edition, the Table of Contents is not functional, so you are unable to select a chapter or the answer key and go there. Instead, I have to guess at the location to get to a given topic. It takes a little time, it works, but its not very user-friendly."
5,pronouns & prepositions,I like the way the book is arranged. Pronouns and prepositions are always a problem for me in German and this book provides me with a good deal of help.
2,boring,i like their music but... just one shot of 3 dudes jamming in a dark bar doesnt cut it for me anymore.pass on this.
5,Total enjoyment,My Mom and I got even more enjoyment out of this video than we'd anticipated (we're both HUGE Doxie fans).Almost 2 hours of smiling and laughing til our cheeks and sides hurt.The best $ I've ever spent. Thank youEllie Stanford
1,I was very disappointed in this DVD.,"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. Having three Dachshunds, my family and I thought this would be a cute movie or short story, not Dachshund races (not even good ones at that); it was the same thing over and over and over again. . . very boring and a waste of 16.95! Needles to say, I would NEVER buy a DVD from this company again."
3,2004 Hyundai Elantra,"I got these for my 2004 Hyundai Elantra GT.The Elantra is know for warping rotors, so no point in buying more expensive rotors.I bought 4 of these at once for $56 shipped (for all 4, heck of a deal). The first set lasted about 25,000 miles before I put the 2nd set on (just put them on a week ago).I got 50,000 miles out of the OEM rotors (should have replaced at 40,000), 30,000 out of a set from the local parts store ($65 for 1 pair), so these are a little worse for wear than OEM or the parts store, but for 1/2 the price of parts store rotors (and 1/4 of some of these ""performance"" rotors that will last about the same amount of time), not a problem since it takes maybe 20 minutes to change the rotors."
4,Soft,"Arrived on time and in excellent condition. It is very white, and very soft. My only complaint is that while knitting, it untwists itself, and I have to keep making sure I have all the separate strands before making my next stitch. Finished product is really really nice though."
4,Easy to understand,"This book makes it easy to understand the more complex terms and concepts taught in Tests and Measurements. The wording and phrasing is somewhat slang and surprising at first because of being used to reading more technical texts, but it is clear cut, easy to follow, and even comical."
4,great book for scout leaders,"gizmos and gadgets contains easy, readable information on scientific principles along with appropriate, fun, hands-on experiements. Makes for great reading for scout leaders, teachers or those who like to mess around at home with their kids. Good addition to any library."
1,For the Brain-Dead,"A scale book with no explanation at all is fairly worthless, and diagrams instead of musical notation is insulting."
4,Venetian walking tours for readers,"The English author adds a literary dimension to seven Venetian walking tours by incorporating quotations from novelists, poets, essayists, reporters, and other observers. The resulting book is livelier than you might expect.Durant Imboden, Venice for Visitors, http://govenice.miningco.co"
5,Fun Femmes!,"All your faves are covered...and maybe a few you forgot about! This book is campy and fun, but also quite informative for movie buffs and anyone old enough to remember the babe-a-licious actresses of the 60's. Would also make a great gift!"
4,Sing a Song of Sixpence.........,"This is a great Miss Marple. It is not exactly the same as the book. Its even better. And it is the first Miss Marple I think, in which the murderer is killed. One problem, A bit boring in some parts."
3,"Good, but not better then the orginal!","This movie was good, and is worth buying considering the price, but it is not better then the first one. Jean-Claude is a much better fighter then Sasha Mitchel, but bringing back Tong-Po was a good idea. If you liked the first one then you should like the sequel, but it will take you awhile to figure out what actually happened to Eric and Kurt, which makes it hard to understand the plot at first."
3,Orignal is better!,"this movie is ok but it doesnt top the orignal, jean claude van damme is the best actor and he destroys Sasha Mitchell. Sasha Mitchell doesnt come close to the kind of actor jean claude van damme is. I say get the first one, its so much better."
2,Watchable...,"Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined ""Cyborg"" and was murky in ""Omega Doom."" This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck."
5,Solti at his best!!,"A wonderful collection of Solti's intensity and drive in this music. He is at his best here and how nice to hear a variety of orchestras. Good ""sampler"" for future purchases."
5,Very Happy!,This table is incredibly cute! It was so easy to put together and required absolutely no tools! I was extremely happy with the customer service for this item! I am thinking about buying another!
3,Nice Table,The table was bigger than i expected but this was a good thing. Great height. I had been wondering about the color...it is white not off white or cream color. Very very simple to put together in 5 minutes. The detail on table was not great though and the paint is not to my liking because the finish is susceptible to easy marking. I have to paint it myself.
4,Nice,"This table is just what I wanted. It's big, surdy and easy to put together. It goes very well with my shabby chic living room, but would also be great in a bedroom.The only thing negative is that the paint job could have been better. I know they were going for that worn look, but it's a little sloppy looking. I find it hard to complain though considering the great price."
3,Decent,"The tables are cute and worth it for the price. However, since they're so cheap, the product isn't the best quality. The first two tables I got were both cracked on the sides. I was able to get replacements without any problems, which was convenient. BUT, one of the replacement tables also had a piece cracked when it arrived. At this point, I don't want to go through the hassle of sending a complaint, receiving another, and potentially getting another damaged table. So, it is what it is."
2,poor fittings,"if you are willing to spend 7-8 hrs shimming, chauking,and painting. this item. then go ahead and buy. the table itself is very pretty. just not what you expect when you buy a table. not worth the trouble."
2,"Looks are deceiving, Horrible Quality","After lusting after this very pretty table for a few months, my fiance ordered it as a Christmas gift. The assembly was very simple. I'll be blunt. This table is garbage. It is light and chintzy, and uneven. We had to sand the legs to get the table to sit level. It looks beautiful, but not what I would consider ""real"" furniture. Bottom line, if you are just getting it to look pretty, fine- but don't expect a high quality item."
3,Elaborate sets and sweeping camerawork the real star.,"Three short stories of de Maupassant of varying lengths (from ten minutes to forty minutes) and of varying interest. The real star here is elaborate Oscar nominated Art Direction and swirling, sweeping Cinematography. BEWARE: this print is very faded and fuzzy and last twenty minutes has no soundtrack. A curio."
2,Update for previous review,"It has been about 3 years since I wrote the first review for this book on Amazon.com. In that time there have been some new, and I feel better publications about R. M. SchindlerThe most comprehensive Text is Judith Sheine's book (entitled R. M. Schindler) published by Phaidon. Please see my review for more details. Sheine is also the editor and narrator for two CD-ROMs produced by Planet Architecture. These are both excellent sources. Lastly is the lavishly photographed catalog for the Schindler Exhibit entitled The architecture of R. M. Schindler by Elizabeth A.T. Smith. This has good essays and photos although I feel is better as supplementry text to Sheine's new book"
4,Intersting film,"This is quite an interesting video. A documentary of the making of a music video and a small history of his life as a gay porn star, and trying to branch out into the mainstream. His lover is included more than I had expected and the video does go into some detail on their life together. This video shows all the problems he had getting the music video made and the acceptance of a male disco diva. If you are a fan of Colton Ford (Glenn) or Blake Harper (Peter), this will be interesting viewing. He does sing quite well and has a great voice. Too bad he did not catch on."
2,Not a good reference,"Despite my hopes this is not a good reference book for computer graphics and I am not sure if it is good for teaching either. It lingers on side subjects that has no bearing with the main theme and is incomplete on topics that most mater to a computer graphics enthusiast. Wasting pages on areas such as why calculators compute tangents so fast has nothing to do CG. Appendices are notoriously off the main course and short. At the end, while I have no doubt about the authors knowledge, I am disappointed with the arrangement and lack of methodical presentation."
4,How Europeans manage value of their banks,"If you're a little bit tired with American-style value management fever you should like this book. It provides an insight into state-of-the-art shareholder value management approaches (M&As, business portfolio management, value chain re-design, RAPM - based capital allocation) but also stresses the stakeholder approach, much more popular in Europe than in the States (especially in continental Europe). You'll find some tips on quality management in banks (specially interesting profitability analysis of quality efforts), measuring customer value added, the Balanced Scorecard model for banks. Numerous examples and case studies make the book even more interesting. Co-operative banks (rarely included in such publications) will also find something for themselves - the Membership Value concept. Taking it all together - I strongly recommend this book."
2,Very Disappointing,"I put this book into our rummage-sale pile today. As a longtime fan of manhole covers, my high expectations for this book proved unwarranted. The author obviously knows a lot about manhole covers, but fails to share it with us. Instead, there is a minimal text and a great many repetitive pictures, some of which could only be loved by the photographer. If you want to read a model for what this book could have been, I would recommend ""The Carriage Trade,"" or ""Building the Nineteenth Century,"" or ""The Baldwin Locomotive Works."""
2,Didn't work,I bought this product thinking it would help the dry condition my Shih Tzu has but it didn't help at all. I was very disappointed.
3,eye cleanse,"was not really thrilled with product, had to add drops and water. used very little, gave it to my neighbor to use on feral kittens she catches."
4,Know What You Are Buying (And Why You Need It),"I like Shawn Trautman's dance-instruction videos very much, but it gets expensive to buy all of the pieces that you must study to have confidence in the ballroom setting. My motive in buying the sampler DVD (and I have several of his other samplers) was to show my father what the Cha Cha, Salsa and Tango looked like. (Dad protested that he could already do the Foxtrot and I did not expect him to get much use from the Hustle steps -- because it is a fairly complex dance with many different steps.) We decided to concentrate on three dances: a slow-tempo [rumba], medium-tempo [cha cha] and fast-tempo dance [Salsa]. The product is introductory and does not teach many steps since the DVD is 77 minutes long, there are five dances to showcase and there is generic introductory material that eats up bandwidth."
2,Not a good video for beginners.,The instructors do not teach the dance steps except by dancing themselves which is difficult to follow. We were only able to follow a few of the steps after many rewinds. The small amount of verbal instrucion is not clear and just as difficult to follow. The photo shots from the waist up are not very helpful for learning to dance. I do not plan to buy any more of their dance videos. There are others on the market that are much better.
3,"Efficient, but lacks depth","Bob Costas and a group of historians takes us through every World Series. Obviously, visual and audio clips of the early, early days are rare, so the time taken with each series is extended as we move through the era to today. It's a effort that skims the surface. Even the ""extras"" lack a little. I liked it but see no reason to watch it again soon."
3,let down by the singing,"This is not a satisfactory recording by modern Handel performance standards. The conducting is very good, and the sound is well balanced and full, but the voices are that kind of totally anemic, boring voice that they used to use for Handel in the 'early music' movement recordings. Very bland, ranging from just bad (René Jacobs) to precise but boring (Laki). No imagination in their enunciation, very little drama. The singling of Jacobs is especially unbearable (countertenor singing has come a LONG way since then...) and Arsace (Jacobs' role) has most of the best arias in the opera. This makes the whole recording little more than a filtered view, sideways glance at the work itself. Enough to make you realize how great it is, but still unsatisfying. I have heard parts of the newer recording on Chandos, and I am going to try that one.Honestly, when you listen to Jacobs, you just wonder what they were thinking!!!"
2,Poor rendition of fabulous book,"If you like the Mrs. Piggle Wiggle books, don't get the movie. it follows the wonderful books only loosely. The videos are shallow and slapstick. Filled with cheap puns appropriate mostly for adults. The set looks like a take off of Blues Clues and dialog make Barney looks sophisticated. My kids like it okay, but my husband and I could barely sit through it.Wait for the book on tape."
4,Software implementation available for S-Plus and R,"Although not obvious, there is software available to implement the functionality described mathematically in the book. Alexander McNeil provides S-Plus code on his personal website, and there is an R port of that code on CRAN called QRMlib. Most of the provided software is on fitting fat-tailed distributions. This is all very useful in practice, if you care to be statistically precise. Unfortunately, many practitioners would clearly prefer rules of thumb to quantitative methods only usable with statistical software that doesn't run in Excel. Excellent theoretical text with solid backing software."
4,"Very good, as far as it goes, but limited perspective","I read this a while ago, and while I was extremely impressed with the theoretical development, and am very happy to have it in my library, I was also struck by the somewhat limited perspective. My background in part is in information theory and statistical learning, which means that I incline to a Bayesian view of uncertainty. But this is an absolutist 'frequentist' book; it does not even seem to be aware of a whole box of powerful theoretical tools that I know (it doesn't acknowledge them even to dismiss them).I was fascinated recently to see that Ricardo Rebonato - in spite of quoted review above - seems to agree: in his new book (plight of the fortune tellers), he makes the same points that occured to me."
4,recommend,"I've been using this product for almost two years. i have combination/dry/acne prone skin and this is the only cleanser that somewhat hydrates my skin. I've tried the Cetiphil because i heard that its comparable to this, but for me there was no comparison. The dermalogica essential cleanser is a very thick cream, whereas Cetiphil is a little more watery. I recommend this to those with dry skin, it does the job. Overall its a good product."
2,facial cleanser,I am glad I bought a small bottle to try it. Its greasy and does not remove makeup very well.
2,disappointed,"I ordered this item because I don't want to use the cerama Bryte with the pad every day to clean my cooktop because it really needs some elbow works and not every time I need to. I'd like to have a small cleaning work when it only has some water stain on the cooktop. Unfortunately, this wipe is too wet, it will leave the stain itself. I still need to use the paper to clean it after use this wipe. No need to say, it won't work for those heavy stains at all. Really disappointed. I won't buy it again."
1,Unsatisfying product.,"I purchased two boxes of these wipes and was EXTREMELY disappointed. They may clean glass surfaces but are certainly not good enough for cleaning cook tops. They DO NOT remove grease and burns. DO NOT BUY. Buy ""Carbona Clean It! Ceramic Stove Top Wipes"" (you won't regret it) but not from amazon. Carbona.com sells them half price."
2,Not helpful - seem no different from baby wipes!,"I ordered these thinking they were the cooktop wipes I'd had before: ones with cooktop safe abrasive ""sand"" somehow mixed into each wipe. Those really cleaned the burn-on food from by ceramic cooktop.These wipes, well, I really don't see how they are different from baby wipes! They just cost much, much more. There's no abrasive action at all! Do NOT recommend."
4,Just buy plain alcohol,Works great but all it contains is rubbing alcohol.Would've just bought a cheap bottle of alcohol and used it instead of the fancy wipes.
3,Okay but leaves streaks,This product is ok for just maybe cleaning water spots and very minor splashes but not for anything tougher. I use this product in conjunction with the same brand cream cleaner and pad. It works better this way. I first use the cream cleaner and then wipe behind that with these wipes. I still have to use a paper towel or microfiber towel to get the streaks off.
2,ok - dry wipes,"My wipes seemed just dry. I was hoping for a more moist product with a scrubbing type surface in the wipe. I'm not sure if I just received a dry canister, but beware before you buy."
5,Looks like new again,This is an awesome product... I purchased it with the cleaner & a tool to help get off baked on food. I have tried alot of different products this is the ONLY one that worked. My stove looks brand new again. Highly recommend this product.
4,Another Loius LaMour great read aventure,"Having read most of Louis LaMour's novels, I've not found one that was not a exciting read."
2,Not what expected.,"I found this to be a product of rather questionable quality. The Mortar had been chipped or was defective in two different places and had been repaired with something of a different color and one end of the Pestle had been capped with a rather bad piece of stone, and poorly capped at that. I saw nothing in the write-up about it being a ""second"" or an ""imperfect"" or anything to that affect. I was very disappointed in it as it was a gift. Sometimes it doesn't pay to buy sight unseen.Based upon this I would not recommend buying from Creative Home."
4,Misc Essays By David Mamet,"As a sometime admirer, but not exactly a fan of, David Mamet's theater work, I wasn't sure how much I'd care for this short collection of essays. I'm very glad I took the chance. Mamet writes clearly and firmly. He's the opposite of dogmatic. He can be harsh but he can also be thoughtful. Most of these essays are on theater related topics but not all. My favorite was the one on The Cherry Orchard.To sum up - many short, intellectually stimulating, essays written by a guy who knows how to grab a reader.Note - Mamet's other essay collection, Jafsie and John Henry is similarly excellent. If you liked this you'll probably like that. Also, it's subject matter is a little more diverse."
4,Inspiring one to be better,"This book's strength was that it made me challenge my own beliefs. As a filmmaker and writer, I have developed a sense for writing crap that appeals to the lowest common denominator. Mamet made me re-evaluate what made me become a writer, and the importance of the theater. I find his writing very interesting from the standpoint that he is very much of the theater, and an elitist as a result, but he is very favorable when discussing Hollywood. I think everyone should read his section on the Oscars in this book. Overall, I was very pleased I read the book, and would have to ultimately recommend it to others."
5,Great documentary!!,"I am not typically a documentary watcher however personal issues in my own life drove me to watch this based upon a recommendation from friends. It is a very moving look at the struggle some people suffer through. Accepting ourselves for who we are is never easy, especially when you're different. These people suffered more than most but came out with an acceptance of who they are and a lot of love discovered around them. Watch this!!"
5,Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you!,An excellent book. Shows the inner-workings of Object Pascal and VCL. The COM/OLE stuff is a bit out of date (was written for D2).
3,"Good Songs, Well Sung","This is a nice collection of good standards culled from a number of separate sessions and collated into this one compilation album.Many of the songs are taken from Fitzgerald's famous songbook sessions and feature arrangements from the likes of Paul Weston (""Irving Berlin"") and Nelson Riddle (""George and Ira Gershwin""). The material is consistently good, arrangements well-crafted and Ella's singing - as always - is superb. These tracks will make a welcome addition to any music lovers collection.The only weakness to this CD is that it doesn't work so well as an album in an aethestic sense, they are simply a miscellany of items that don't fit anywhere else. The other downside is that some of the tracks (the wonderful Nelson Riddle arranged pieces) have appeared previosuly elsewhere, so on a collection with only a few tracks this makes a sizeable proportion of the whole collection.This is a nice CD worth buying. It is just not essential."
2,Pretty awful,"I actually thought this book was kind of terrible. I've liked Dallas Schulze's books in the past, but this certainly was not a good effort. The romance just didn't seem to be there, and the characters didn't seem to be developed well at all. And the whole part about Dan not having a place in his daughter Danielle's life didn't make sense. Was it just going to be a big secret forever? Seemed kind of stupid to me. The whole ""broken people"" idea is a good idea, but it needed to be fleshed out much more than this...in this book, it just seemed to be a device for throwing the couple together and explaining their love for each other."
5,Wonderful lighthearted story,Wonderful lighthearted story that makes you feel good even on a bad day....I should know I read it on one of those days. Great story line very well written.
1,Dissapointed when learned it contains Carrageenan!,"Carrageenan is a thickening agent. It's the vegetarian equivalent of casein, the same protein that is isolatedfrom milk and used to thicken foods. Casein is also used to produce paints, and is the glue used to holda label to a bottle of beer. Carrageenan is the magic ingredient used to de-ice frozen airplanes sitting ontarmacs during winter storms.Very dissapointed Blue Diamond uses this crap on a such a great non-dairy alternative."
3,NOT ancient world - near eastern world is more accurate,"This book is NOT about religions of the ancient world. Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Taoism, Confuscianism, Shinto, Bon etc are not covered. If you are looking for a thorough examination of western religions from 3rd millineum BCE to 5 century CE then this is quite a book; however, as there is no treatment of half of the ""civilized"" world in this time frame then the book hardly can claim to treat religions of the ancient world. Apparently either India, China and environs had no ancient religions or they are not of this world -;)"
1,Still Waiting,I am still waiting for the arrival of this item. It had still not arrived when I left home earlier today.
1,BLED EVERYWHERE!!!!!,"You get what you pay for....I bought this because of the low price. When I received it, the red color on the rubber bled on everything, it would even come off on my hands, left marks on my patients & forget about putting it in your WHITE lab coat!Save your money & use the end of your stethoscope!"
4,"Poor quality, but great price!","Item appears to be quite a bit lesser quality than traditional models, but it is to be expected for the price. Overall, it still works fine, and at that price its worth it! Item did take a month to arrive--two weeks after the latest delivery date provided."
1,It may get the job done- if you don't pass out from the smell of toxic fumes.,I opened the package and instantly had a headache. I washed them. Left them outside. And still couldn't pack them in my suitcase for a medical mission. Waste of money if you or your patients or anyone who doesn't want to lose some brain cells can afford a couple bucks more.
5,Sharp,I returned this as it had a very pointed end. It seemed dangerous to have a medical tool that was so pointed.
1,Never came.,I emailed the company I purchased it from after it didn't show up. They said they would reship it. I still haven't seen it. Maybe it will come some day.
2,Review,Looked beat up...rubber was scratched up and looking like it was peeling off.I know I didn't buy it new but still it was pretty ugly according to my standards.
5,Added this to a 4 yr old's doctor kit.,"Now he walks around holding up that hammer saying ""Who wants a check up?' As for the hammer itself it is nice and heavy and has a good balance. It is easy to hold. I just wish he would stop hitting me on my knee cap with it."
2,Fair,Is a good product only problem is that the red color stains clothes so had to cover it with clear nail polish. Still works!
5,Great for kayaking!,"Bought these for fall kayaking and they're working out great. The first time I used them the water that I had to step in to was too deep, so obviously I got wet, but my feet were still very warm. Second time I used them, I was able to step in fairly shallow water. They kept my feet dry and warm for the entire 5 hour kayaking trip. Highly recommended."
4,Published sizing seems correct.,I ordered three pair of these boots for my family. Based upon other published reviews they were ordered on the small side. I usually wear a size 11 so I ordered a 10. It is a bit tight but usable. I ordered size 5 for my daughter (normally a women's 8) and size 6 for my wife (normally women's size 8 1/2). The 6's barely fit my daughter. I sent the 5's back in exchange for 7's to fit my wife.Conclusion: The published sizes are reasonably accurate. Think twice about the recommendations to order small.The quality seems very good for the price.
3,no way to predict men or women style being shipped to you,"When making order, there is no way to choose men or women, thought it's unisex.Based on others review that the boots tend to be larger, so, ordered size 6 (normal shoe size 7 ). After received the order, the boots look slim, and cute, fit for me. But there is a little problem with the bottom inside. so called the customer service, and ordered a replacement. After the size 6 replacement arrived, they look much bigger than the original size 6, put them together and compared, found they look different, the original have a blue print at the back looks like ""W"", and do not have the white line at the bottom, guess that's for women, and the replacement does not have it (looks exactly like the pic on the website, with the white line at bottom), probably for men. but there is no selection options on the ordering page, so you never know which style will be shipped to you.The boot itself is ok."
4,great boots,"i bought these boots to wear with my fins as well as walking around boat, sand etc. they are very comfortable"
3,Kind of narrow,"Bought these for paddleboarding. The quality of the stitching and materials is excellent. My main concern is that they are pretty narrow and walking around in them I find my toes all bunched together. At the widest part of your foot, the boot doesn't really stretch where your foot rests inside it because of the rubber sole. Other parts of the boot have ample or maybe even too much room. It doesn't seal around my ankle very tightly and I'm concerned water could enter there fairly easily. The boot seems the right size but dimensions are off. Still giving it 3 stars because the quality of the materials is so good."
3,Zippers won't stay up.,Bought these for my 14 year old son for creek exploring while camping. Right away he complained that the zippers don't stay up. Too bad otherwise they were OK.
3,Way too small,"I wear a size 9-1/2 shoe/boot. Based on some of the comments about the boots running large, I decided to get a size 9. I could barly get them on my feet and they were so small my toes were curled up. I returned the boots without any problems, but since they were so small I have no idea what size would truly fit me (so I did not reorder a larger pair). Decided to get a pair of Body Glove Men's Riptide Water Shoes (size 9 fit great). Didn't really need the insulation anyway and just wanted a water shoe for kayaking. I gave the boot 3 stars since the refund went so smooth (and return shipping was covered). Maybe the sizes are women's sizes and not mens??"
5,good boot,"These boots were a correct fit, other people say to order big and small but i got my size and they fit great. With most dive boots, they will get water in them so do not order to big cause they will keep your feet cold."
3,A strange book,"I give this book three stars because the author has done some excellent research and has presented it well in this book. However, the set-up to me doesn't make much sense and the phrase ""I spent the weekend with a Hollywood starlet"" makes it sound as if the author actually met Joi. While the cover artwork is excellent I wish we could have seen some stills from her films or some of the photos the author describes at length in the book."
5,Very Interesting Read,"For the fans of Joi Lansing, you'll enJOY this book. There isn't much written about her, but the author admits his own fascination and weaves his personal life in while reconstructing hers. She was more visible in film than I thought. I have only seen her on Scopitones. A very good read about a forgotten star."
5,How to have Joi,"Joi Lansing was a very appealing actress, model, and singer, and much more charming to me than her counterpart Marilyn Monroe. This book is a excellent history of Joi and how her life brought joy to those she entertained. It is so ironic that her ""best"" feature was her breasts, and she died of complications of breast cancer as a young woman. Rest In Peace!"
2,No other choices...,"This is the only book I am aware of that is dedicated to Joi Lansing. With that in mind I guess it is pretty good compared to all the others.There is some information about Joi to enjoy reading about but the author seems more interested in telling us about his time spent walking the beach or what he is having for dinner. Strange ramblings go on for pages about the architecture of the beach house he is staying at while trying to write this book and quite the fixation with the lady who lives next door. I not sure I undetstand what the heck all this has to do with telling the story of Joi Lansing.If you are interested in Joi, this is better than nothing because there is nothing else out there that I could find in the way of a book."
4,"Dark story, bright Brit storytelling","This is an intriguing and entertaining story inspired by the original Holmes tales colored with the more modern sensibilities of maybe ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""From Hell."" The production looks much less teevee-like than most British teevee shows. And, by the way, it's not really 1.33:1; it's a decently letterboxed, non-anamorphic 1.66."
5,Good movie,I'm a Sherlock fan. This is good. Gives you an idea of where the Sherlock stories came from as there really was a Dr. Bell.
3,Nice color,The color of this product is nice. It added a pop to my current color. It was just messy to use and not worth it for temporary. I probably will not buy again.
2,Could have been a great book,"Much research went into it, but the writing was uncoordinated and the use of maps was laughable. He gives great detail on a campaign with a map that shows very little of what is in the text. It is comparable to a walking tour of New York City with detailed descriptions of the sites - with a map of the subway system. Very few points of reference match up.I had to download and print maps to make sense of the text. That improved the impact of the material, but also me wonder what he was thinking when he put the few poor maps in the book.He does briefly cover Mac Arthur's attitude towards the Aussies, but it is glossed over. Mac defied 3 Presidents and was an arrogant bastard who took credit and assigned blame. He was more PR than prepared."
1,I love 98* but this...,"I am the BIGGEST 98* fan but this was a waste of my $$. I was so mad that on the cover of this video it hads great reviews but all it is a grey-haired man talking about there finacial future. There was also one woman who talked about their ""Road to Succses"" which was about the succses of ""Invisible Man"". I would not waste my money. They didn't even speak."
2,"I Love 98degrees, but don't waste your money on this video","98degrees are the hottest guys ever, but the video is not worth your time or your money. The official 98degrees video will be coming out soon, so if I were you I would wiat for that to come out instead."
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge!!! 98grees fan, but this sucked. It's really nothing but an interview. The only good part was with their old teacher. Everything else was nothing but bull@#$! Sorry, but this wasn't worth it. LOVEYa Sweetpea"
2,Starts off promising...,"This book started out very well, with the interesting premise of a properous businessman who grows more and more unscrupulous and eventually winds up in jail. The early details of the man's youth with his mentally unbalanced, emigrant merchant father are very entertaining, and the details of the man's unsatisfactory homelife are often very funny. However, the surreal nature of the prison life and the magical realism that the author indulges in are overdone, too detailed and ridiculous.The author seems to be trying to say that the businessman's corruption stemmed from something in his soul, and that the prison with its psuedo-psychologist warden and its crazy rules is there to address this part of the man's character, but in the end it's all a tedious mish-mash and the speeches all go on for too long. The book collapses under the weight of this surreal, oddball device."
1,Worst taste. Bring back the old.,Kraft changed the bottle and taste. My kids and I don't like it and now I am searching for the last remaining bottles to buy before looking for another Catalina dressing. And it won't be this one. Why change a good thing?
1,good god why?,"Why has humanity taken a step backwards? This obvious overstatement is a reflection of what I think about this ""new taste"". The dressing has lost everything about it that made it good. I love salads and this is the only dressing I use on them. Its going to be a difficult struggle to find something that will replace the old Catalina; yet it is something that must be done because this stuff is horrible. Kraft, may god have mercy on your soul."
1,"I hate the ""new"" Catalina!",The new Catalina dressing is awful. The 1st time I bought it I thought it was bad & took it back to the store for a refund. I no longer buy Kraft dressings on a regular basis like I used to. Now I buy other brands as they go on sale. So much for Kraft caring what the public thinks. They might as well take this product off the shelves as it appears by these posts that they are not selling to many.
1,"Catalina ""Classic"" Is Back!","We just found ""Classic Catalina"" at Walmart! Seems they realized their horrible mistake and brought the old formula back in August 2009. I just got off the phone with them about this. Get this - They say the only change is that they went back to artificial preservatives. They said the change in taste is entirely due to the preservatives used. What a bunch of bull. Coke used the same kind of bogus explanation when they brought back ""Classic Coke"". Hopefully Kraft has learned its lesson. The babyfaced marketing MBA's at Kraft were probably still in pre-school when Coke screwed up. Apparently this was not covered in their business classes."
1,Overrated and cheesy.,"My friends told me to buy this cd, and that it was overwhelmingly wonderful. I think its the silliest music I've heard in a while. There is almost nothing here worth mentioning of any quality at all. The album itself sounds quite good. Some of the string arrangements, which I understand the band didn't write, are pretty good. but none of the songs seem grounded in anything particularly genuine, none of the melodies are very moving, I just don't see what the big deal is about this band."
1,this is so bad,"I cannot believe how weak this music is. The singer tries real hard to sound like York but he sounds like an idiot because his lyrics are so bad. And the music, while well-produced, is just annoying. These guys cant write, sing, or do anything right on this album. How old are they like 12? Sounds like it."
1,Not What I expected,"I bought this book, expecting a lot more pictures. It seems however that the publishers didn't have enough pictures and tried instead to fill the pages with shallow and cheap commentries. I didn't buy this to read about these dictators and learn about them. There are much more in depth and serious books and materials for that. I just wanted to see how they lived and what their homes/palaces looked like. This book only had a few pictures which can probably be found on the Net anyway. I was dissapointed"
1,Full of lies - no research,"Page 102 Slobodan Milosevic. I am shocked that Mr York did not even bother to see who has been living in the Royal Compound in Belgrade following our revolution 5 October 2000. The text is loaded with lies. Mr York did not even bother to inform himself of the facts. For example page 103 shows my desk, a picture of my wife and I and three sons Peter, Philip and Alexander, look at the pen holder with the A and crown. The White House is the White Palace and page 106 shows the main hall with a portrait of my grandfather King Alexander above the fireplace. Page 107 was never a chapel and the theme is about Czar Dushan poems and what Mr York refers to as a cross is a billiard cue holder. My family name is Karadjordjevic and not Kradordevice. There are many more errors. Full of Lies - no proper research"
5,Newest Technology in Ironing,"I was very please with this new Vertical Steam Iron. It works like a dream, if you have to iron.Ligfht and easy to use. The burst of steam, really does remove difficult creases."
5,"My wife is happy, so I'm happy","It's apparently my job to survey and buy household items, even though my wife uses them the most. She told me the basic features she wanted, and I found them -- and more -- in this reasonably priced iron. She told me she's happy with it, so that's worth five stars to me. Seems like a nice product."
3,storyteller,"Summers world is blown apart when Cameron comes into her life. She's a healer from a long line of healers and loves the ponies that surround her on the small island. Something is different about Cameron but she can't put it all together until one day he explains to her that he is an alien from another planet. A planet called Cyteron where her dead mother now resides. He explains the ways of his planet and tells her that it's hers too which can't possibly be true, or can it? Good story! Who knows, maybe someone I know is an alien and I don't know it! Maybe one day we'll all find out if this is possible. Very interesting premise to think your neighbor could be from another planet, another galaxy. Why not!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Wonderfully creative and, as always, very well-written","Barbara Delinsky is my favorite author and this book doesn't disappoint. Yes, you may have to suspend your imagination (doesn't almost every novel ask you to do that?), but within the confines of the characters she creates and the place where they live, I totally bought the whole thing from beginning to end. Each character has their own distinct voice, which helped to make them really come alive. A definite re-read. What a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon."
3,"Pure, unadulterated escapism","I know the plot was outrageous - an alien! But I just could not put this book down. Okay, so it's not a literary classic, but for pure fantasy and fun escape, it's a guilty pleasure I thoroughly enjoyed."
3,I should have known better,"This book and its author are endorsed by some of the most vague, soft-on-the-science type of new-agers out there; I purchased it despite this because I was researching the enneagram of personality heavily at the time. This was a mistake. Wolinsky has nothing new to add to the enneagram, and his ""chaos"" approach to psychology has nothing to do with chaos science, which he readily admits he does't understand at all--he simply uses it as a marketing tool, one he has, incredibly, copyrighted. This looney book might serve as a useful introduction to the basic typological descriptions, but if you're already familiar with them, skip it. Unless, of course, you're one of the millions who finds foggy, feelgood psychobabble of the kind K. Wilber, D. Chopra, L. Dossey and the rest of their gang write appealing--this guy does the same, only with more qualifications and less originality."
4,One of the Better Ones,"Since Lauren and Dash are my favorite couple in the book, this is one of my favorite in the series. Their on again off again relationship recieves another huge jolt as Tri Beta sorority house burns down. The book is pretty exciting and has a lot more action and tension than most of the other ones in the series. However, the predicatablity of this, like all the other books are a slight drawback. But if you are looking for a fun book that doesn't require a lot of thought, I recommend this along with any other in the series."
2,You get what you pay for!,"A cheap product, but nice art. I would not purchase this item if you plan to play it. It's for decoration purposes only."
1,Don't buy it.,I ordered this wanting to learn the sitar. It is so crappy. I've only had it 2 days and 2 strings have already broken. You cannot tune it. It sounds like crap. My assumption is that this product is used as decoration. I'm very disappointed. I am going to be ordering a REAL sitar after I've read as many reviews available.
1,FIRE WOOD........,"Common sense will tell you that half an instrument should give you half the sound. With these, you won't even get that. These sitars are equal to those kidde pianos you'd find at Toys R Us, or a crank kidde guitar that plays pop goes the weasle!Sitars, at least the wooden ones, are built to resonate, so much so that the main string vibration sets off the ringing in the sympathetic strings underneath the main strings, producing God's glorious sounds.These 3/4 and 1/2 size sitars will never....N-E-V-E-R compare to a full sized, reputably made sitar. Period.Please---- don't bother with sitars like this folks, take it from people like me who made the mistake buying this size. These are wall-hangers.Check out Rain City Music or Ali Akbar College of Music for a real sitar, made by good crafts-people."
3,Mediocre orchestra playing degrades exquisite Dvorak,"The Czech Philharmonic behind Pamela Frank frankly sounds more like an elementary school gig than a world renowned orchestra. The orchestra's only high point is the introduction, the only point in the entire concerto where some level of intensity is played. Pamela Frank's prodigic music-making is readily noticed with her passionate opening: declaring spot-on intonation from the start, she holds the listener spellbound, until the orchestra makes their next entrance. Disappointing would easily describe this CD, for the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra sorely affects the quality of the CD, and if it wasn't for Pamela Frank (whose technical skills are simply phenomenal) this CD would be a complete disaster."
2,changed the product,I don't understand why the Health Valley oat bran has been changed from a 5 star cereal I've enjoyed for years to something that seems to be an astonishing combination of cardboard and sawdust. Not all change is progress.
3,"Very Good Cereal, but...","Very good cereal, but the 16 ounce size has now been discontinued & replaced with smaller size at a greater price (I believe due to the manufacturer). I ordered three cases on my last order and one expired that month and one the next month.The taste of the cereal is good and not very sweet, but that is what I prefer. The number of manufacturers making oat bran flakes has definitely decreased so I was happy to find these. I'll probably order again and hope for a better expiration."
4,Can anyone compare to . . . . . ?,"Anyone recall the P**t Fortified Oat Flakes? The best cereal ever and for some insane reason, P**t pulled it off the market?Apparently it wasn't UN-healthy enough and had the potential to attract kids and keep them from eating a cup of sugar every morning?Any way, it you can, put your comparing rating up for others to learn from.there are a lot of folks looking for their old time 60's - 70's era favorite cereal. Even a Facebook page for trying to get the companies attention?Of course, as I said, they wouldn't even know how to bring it back AS IT WAS, and how to market something that was actually good for you to eat.Thanks"

DO NOT PAY THIS OUTRAGEOUS AMAZON PRICE. SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM"
5,A Distinguished Collection,"This distinguished collection of critical essays on Victorian novels (by prominent American and British scholars) offers an impressive survey of a long and complex era in English literary history. Challenging ideas, not cliches, form the nexus of great discussions for university-level debate. The companion book, Victorian Literature, Modern Essays in Criticism, edited by Austin Wright (A Galaxy book 52), continues the detailed examinations."
3,split decision,"Too violent & bloody. Ciarin Hinds & Kelly are good, as expected, but themes and graphics seem contrived to shock the viewer as their primary objective."
1,Above Suspicion Falls Below,Violence is beyond what is necessary to tell the story. It becomes totally trash. Poor dynamics between the cast members
4,Above Suspicion,Good Entertainment. It is a modern day look at the Prime Suspect style of police drama. Ciaran Hinds is always worth the money. He was the reason that I actually read the offer to purchase. I have to say that it is worth the money. Both the stories were interesting and held your interest. If you enjoy a good story Above Suspicion will give you all you want.
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I am a huge fan of previous Lynda LaPlante series, especially Trial and Retribution and Prime Suspect. I had high hopes that this series would be as good or better than her earlier works. This is not the case. The main characters are not particularly gripping or engaging. Kelly Reilly in particular is a very poor substitute for Victoria Smurfit or Helen Mirren. She seems perpetually confused and uncomfortable in her police role, not at all the strong female lead Ms. LaPlante has created so well in the past. I was overall disappointed with this purchase and delighted to see that Ms. LaPlante turned her attention to Series 5 of Trial and Retribution after this misstep."
5,Great Product...,"This wall mount bracket is very sturdy, easy to install and works great. It comes with all the hardware neccessary for installation and was priced cheaper than similar brackets at Wal-Mart. I highly recommend it!"
4,"Good for a 50"" plasma","Despite having nightmares for three days about waking up to a cracked in half 50"" plasma KURO, this mount is still going strong. I'm giving it a 4 because I DID have to go and buy much stronger anchors for the brick that I mounted it into. They're not expensive... just inconvenient. But for the price of the mount, who cares?"
5,Great product!,I can't say enough about this product especially for the price. I Had my 42inch plasma up on the wall I. About 30 minutes. Straight forward instructions and the built in level made it a breeze to install. This is by no means a cheap inferior product to what you find in the big box retailers. It is just simply cheaper! I was skeptical at first but after receiving and installing and now after about 2 months no issues what so ever.
5,Great for the price!,"We used this mount for our 52"" plasma tv and it works great. We bought better screws like some of the reviews had suggested, otherwise everything was fine and it was easy to put together. We love it."
5,Great low cost all brand tv wall mount,"Costs a lot less than the name brands, works just as well, quick shipping and very fair price."
4,wall mount strong but not the flattest,"This wallmount is very solid and has no problem holding my 52"" TV. I mounted it directly to the studs and although it comes with a set of screws I used my own, all the way through the stud with washers and nuts. (The wall was open due to remodeling). Once the mount is mounted it is easy to hang and secure the monitor on it. What I don't particularly like is the fact that the mount comes pretty far out so if you stand next to the monitor you can see that the monitor is not as close to the wall as I would like. This has to do with the angle adjuster. Other than that it's very good value for money given what is out there."
4,Good Price & Product,This TV mount was easy to install and adjust but difficult if you have to add or raplace a cable. Too tight to the wall.
5,Nice mount.,"The installation was pretty simple. The mount fit my 50"" Panasonic perfectly. I was able to complete the entire installation without a second person. The built in level was also helpful. There were several choices of hardware included to fit different tvs and mounting locations. All in all, a great mount for the money."
5,Great Mount!,I must say that this is one of the best mounts I have used. I have used 4 different mounts over the years and I would never purchase a different mount again. You can’t beat the price and what all you get. It comes in two pieces that you screw together so you don’t have a very long awkward box to deal with. I was able to store it easily until I was ready to mount it. It comes with many different screws individually packaged and labeled with the sizes. I was able to look in my TVs manual and find the right screws for my TV without the guessing game. The instructions are clear cut and easy to follow. It comes with a level and a HDMI cord as a bonus. The best part is the price! Go to Wal-Mart and they will have mounts in the 75-150 range. You really can’t beat this!
3,Wall mount,"This item is ok, but it is a little flimsy and not made of thick metal. It should be a little thicker. But does the job for a cheap price."
5,great wall mount,easy to install. sturdy. i recommend this to all of you looking for a cheap but high quality wall mount
4,Easy to install,"Easy to install, the screws looked fine to me, I bought a few extra because I wanted more than 4. It's been up for over a month and seems to be just fine."
4,Good mount for the money,Mount was easy to install. Able to support my 65lb 55 inch Vizo tv. Tilt levers easy to use and are adjustable to allow turning in tight space. Instructions need to be clearer on what screws to use. level was close but would recommend using a 4ft level to spand mounting plate. Comes with many size screws to fit smaller to larger tvs. all in all rather happy with the mount
4,Solid HDTV Mount!,I have metal studs so I had to use toggle bolts and bought some heavy duty drywall anchors so it cost me a little bit more. The wall mount is completely solid and there is no bending or flexing anywhere. I had bought this for a 42' LED TV and while some say it was overkill but there is peace of mind that the wall will come down before the TV. It comes with a level built in to the wall plate and I was made very sure it was completely straight when I attached it to the wall. After installing the arms for the TV imagine my surprise when the TV WAS NOT level. I thought I had done something wrong since the level of the wall plate was perfectly straight. After several tries of re hanging the TV I decided to tilt the wall plate so it wasnt level and try again. Eureka the TV was level. So I would recommend before you tighten the wall plate screws to tight to make sure the TV is level. Other than having to spend extra time making sure it was level I am very happy with the product.
4,"Ample Support, very complete","Comes with a complete assortment of screws to fit a wide variety of TV's to the verticle mounts. I agree with another poster that the screws to hold the plate to the wall could be bigger but probably not needed for sub 50 lb units. The included screws and plug for adapting the unit to a concreate wall seem very large but would be a good idea for a really heavy unit.I used this to adapt a 42"" TV to a 37"" fully articulating TV mount (the new thin LED/LCD's weigh less than my old LCD) by drilling holes in the new plate and buying half inch 1/4 inch bolts."
4,"Decent mount for flat screen, especially for the price","This is a pretty good flat screen TV mount for the price. I own another one that is much better quality and slightly easier to hang the TV, but it costs a lot more. If you're looking for a good, cheap mount, this is the one to get."
3,"ok, but not really moveable","This wall mount is limited in movement, but works fine otherwise. Be aware of the lack of movement aspect if you need full range."
3,Basicly what I expected.,"The mount was basically what I expected, some of the screw threads were messed up so I had to go buy replacements. Overall OK."
5,NICE AND STRONG,Nice wall mount. Easily installed and very strong foundation. Fast delivery and good price. Highly recommended for gift or to put up in your house.
5,"Great Price, Sturdy Item, Easy To Install",Recommended. Must less than other comparable mounts I have seen and even comes with the HDMI cord which my husband spend $18.00 alone for the other one we just bought.
5,Great value in a TV mount!,"The other reviews are spot on. This mount is extremely inexpensive, ridiculously easy to mount and works as advertised. I wish everything else I purchased was this great of a value. Specifically, it comes with an HDMI cable. The mounting hardware fit like a dream and it only took 20 minutes to mount to the wall. Great product at an amazing price!"
4,"Good product, great price","I bought this item to mount a 40"" Samsung LED TV. It was relatively easy to mount. As other reviewers suggested, I used my own level and didn't rely on the built in one. My only problem was that I needed to use the spacers which came with the mount to attach the tv to the rails. With the spacers, the screws were too short to attach the tv to the rails, thus an inconvenient trip to the hardware store was necessary before I could finish the job. The product seems very sturdy and the price is right. I would buy it again."
5,PERFECT!,"This thing is perfect. Look no further. It's solid metal, instructions are good and easy. They give you extra hardware, a level and a HDMI cable! Who are these guys? I used this to mount my LG 57"" HDTV. Just buy it!"
4,tv mount,Very easy to install. dont use there suppliedlevel. To cheap the hdmi cord was good quailtyVery simple to put up. Well worth th price I paid.most important you get everything u need to install it.
3,"Easy Install, kinda lower quality",Very quick and easy install. The back panel is 2 pieces which I feel lowers the durability of the unit and creates more work for assembly and install than needed. Good bang for the buck though.
5,Excellent Product.,These mounts are excellent for the value. I was surprised to see how thick of metal they used. These were very simple to install and work as advertised.I hung 3 TVs for the price it would have cost me to hang 1 if I were to buy a mount from a local store.
1,"This mount is NOT for a TV above 40""","This Wall Mount will only hold at max a 40"" TV.It's way to thin and frail to hold anything beyond 40"".Plus the screw holes on the mount doesn't fit a standard 60"" tv like mine.Thankfully my installation guy had a heavy duty one that he charged me less for than I got for the VideoSecu mount."
4,Solid Mount,"Everything was great, but tightening the bottom screw of the tv mount to the wall mount once hung is very difficult. You need a screwdriver about 18"" long."
5,Worked Great!,"This product worked great and the price was excellent! I am so pleased we did not waste our money by purchasing a more expensive wall mount at a large, well-known, electronics store as it was not at all necessary. Easy to Use/Install and we have had no issues. Would recommend!"
5,Good mount,Good price. Easy to set up. I used it to hang my 60 inch tv on the wall. I would buy again.
4,Lacking the right size screws,"The mount is fairly heavy and feels solid. This works well with 24"" spaced wall-studs. The instructions were alright, I mean it's such a simple design I don't think much elaboration is necessary. I mounted a 60"" and the tilt worked fine without crushing cables on the back. Total install time was about an hour for me.Please verify the size screw that your TV manufacturer recommends to attach the mounting bracket. My TV required a thread depth of 17-30mm, the screws that were provided by VideoSecure only gave me a working depth of 5mm. 5mm means only one turn in... that's a 100 pound TV held up on the wall by ONE turn of the support screw. I said, screw this, and went to the hardware store to buy a longer attachment screw.After was said and done the mount felt sturdy and seems to be holding the TV quite well."
4,Installs well,"Worked great for the installation of our 58"" Panasonic Plasma. The directions are typical, lots of picture few words, but easy enough. We were able to get the whole job done in a few hours. Would have been faster, but wanted to make sure it was level and solid. Scary the 1st time you let go of your new TV and it is resting 4 feet above the floor! But it has held well.Only complaint is it would be nice if the cut out circles in the plate were larger or if the whole center was open. It would allow you put the recessed outlet and wires the perfect spot. And would allow for an easier installation of them as well."
5,Great Bracket,"I purchased this bracket based on the reviews and have been extremely satisfied. Like many of the other reviewers, I went to Lowes to pick up better lag bolts. The bolts that come with the bracket are worthless. Other that that, a great product!"
5,Excellent Product,"Best price out there!I've ordered two of these for both of my 40"" TV's sets. They are straight forward and easy to mount. I can't find a better price, which is why I bought this. As a bonus, it also comes with a 6 foot hdmi cable. The only thing I noticed is that the hinge for changing the angle isn't strong enough to allow for fine angle adjustment. The TV either has to stay upright, or tilt to the maximum. This is not a big deal for me as I have mine flat with the walls.Overall, you can't find a better price out there for a comparable TV mount.VideoSecu Adjustable Tilt TV Wall Mount for 37""-60"" Plasma TV LCD mount Flat Panel Screen black Bracket with Free 6 ft HDMI Cable MP501B M43"
5,High Quality Mount,"After recieving the mount and comparing it to the ones at Best Buy for $299.00, I couldn't tell the difference. Very satisfied, have my 50 in mounted into a brick fireplace. Very easy to install. I also saved $270.00, that's what you call a bargin."
4,"Great, one small flaw","It is a very easy installation, and the built in level and availability for center stud mounting made it the perfect choice for me. The one problem i had with it was that because the mount is very shallow, it is damn near impossible to tighten the lower securing bolts when the tv is mounted. I have a 47 in panasonic and needed a 2 ft flat head to reach it, along with 15 minutes of headache. other than that, works and looks great!"
5,Great Product,"This product works great. It is easy to install. The only minor problem I have installing this product it that there is not much space on the back between the TV and the wall frame. You would need a long screw driver(12"" or longer with small handle)to reach the security screws on the frame for finishing up the installation. I installed this on my Sharp AQUOS LC60LE632U 60-inch TV. The bottom at the lower back of this Sharpe TV sticks out a lot. This prevents me from being able to tilt the tv to the full 15 degress positive. This is not a problem for me. However, you need to get a different mounting frame if you needed the full tilt for this Sharpe TV. Over all, great product for the price!!"
5,"good TV mount, don't spend 4 times more for one at a department store.","This is essentially the same mount you will end up buying for quadruple the price at a department store. Installation was easy, and its been holding up my 42"" plasma for a while now."
3,Really tight fit at base,"The kit is well appointed and solid, but you will need to be sure to have a plan for running cables and securing the base of the tv to the wall mount... or truly small hands. In future purchases, I will be sure to find a mount that allows access better from below. I still need to purchase a long screwdriver to fully secure my 60"" Vizio LED properly."
4,Great wall mount,It was cheap and it works perfectly. I mounted it twice since I moved 3 months ago. IT tilts down so I can watch TV from my Bed and can be adjusted for perfect position. It does not tilt sideways and does not stick out. I prefer that it does not stick out because I prefer to have it stick to the wall as much as possible. The only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the TV sometimes.
5,Very pleased,"From someone who's not terribly handy, these things are dead easy to install. I installed a 42 and a 32 inch tv in about a couple of hours. Good clear directions. Mount is very sturdy with no moving around . very impressed"
5,Great Product,"Glad I purchased this model with the back mounting plate over similar priced models with just a square frame not only is this model sturdy but the mounting holes and slots make it easy to line up, especially if you have an older house and the wall studs are at different distances. I used this bracket to mount a 40"" samsung lcd and it seems to be perfect for support. Would recommend this bracket for similar sized tv's."
4,Well made mount,"The mount arrived well packaged with a good selection of mounting hardware for different applications. I used it on a 58 inch plasma, so I wanted a strong installation. The lag screws supplied were grade 8.8, and were probably strong enough, but I decided to upgrade to screws bigger in diameter and also longer, just for additional peace of mind. An excellent mount at a great price!"
4,Overall pretty good deal,"This mount worked pretty well for my new 47"" Vizio LCD. It's sturdy, and with the HDMI cable, represents a good bargain. My only complaint is that with a large TV, it's impossible to access the tilt adjustment knobs without removing the TV from the wall. However, once it's mounted and the adjustment is to your liking, you probably won't ever need to change it."
5,great price good product,"Easy install had all the hardware ,the attached level was a great help and to mount the tv on the wall plate took only minimal effort very pleased with my purchase."
3,Video Secu Tilt TV Mount,How I review this product is that it's not that comfortable to work with after is on the wall.but it has a good support.
2,Wokrs but hard to adjust,"This thing is fine if you are going to mount it and leave it, but making any adjustment to angle after you have it mounted is quite impossible. So keep that in mind"
3,"VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount for Most 37""- 70"" LCD LED Plasma TV","Well, its holding my 60 inch plasma on the wall. Installation wasn't difficult at all. I drop the product a couple stars because I thought I was going to crack my tv after installing. The tilt mechanism is impossible; each side moves independently - there is virtually no way ensuring the angles are the same. I tried, thought they were level and locked into place. Put the mount on the wall, tv on mount, and then noticed the two sides weren't tilted at the same angle. Can you imagine the horror of seeing your new 60 inch plasma screen twisted!?! I was able to fix the issue but I would not recommend using the tilt option on this mount.Buy the mount because it's cheap and it'll hold your larger television but if you really want to tilt your tv, look elsewhere. It should have been easy enough for them to build in a rod that connected the two sides to ensure the angles for each bracket are the same."
4,"Great value for 46"" TV mount",This wall mount was a great bargain and it did the job. Able to tilt up and down slightly if needed (no side to side tilt). Pretty standard mount. Comes with a free(!) bubble level.
4,Easy to use worked well and looks great,"Worked as advertised. Very easy to mount and looks good on the wall. I'd suggest getting your own level, but they at least supply one should you not own your own."
3,Decent for the money,This mount is cheap and holds my tv like it is supposed to but the included level was slightly off (had to use my own) and it is IMPOSSIBLE to connect my optical audio cable once installed. I had to take the tv back down (65 inch tv-big pain) to attach the cable; recommend attaching ALL cables prior to installation. Also the tilt screws/handles are difficult to use.
5,My TV hasn't fallen yet,"It works.It is cheap.My TV hasn't fallen yet (46"" LCD)There are mounts out there that might make it a little easier to plug and unplug cables after it's already mounted, but they also are more expensive. I bought this mount to hold my TV up against the wall, and that is what it is doing. Great success!"
3,"Easy installation, but was missing 2 bolts","This wall mount went up very easily, the only problem I encountered was that 2 bolts were missing so I had to get my own bolts. Also once the TV is up on the wall you have to take it down to adjust the tilt because there is no room to loosen the bolt to tilt it forward. other than that it was fine and the TV looks great."
5,Great,Works perfect . I was apprehensive when I bought it but it holds my Sharp 70 inch TV perfectly !!!
4,Works just fine,"Well, it would have got 5 stars had the built in bubble level been worth a damn. Overall, a great product. They give you plenty of options for bolts for all kinds of tv's. The lag bolts are not the best, so make sure you drill pilot holes! Plenty of options for attaching it to the wall. My studs were slightly off center of where I wanted my tv and had plenty of holes to choose from. If you just need a basic wall mount, this is all you need. Holds my 55"" LCD just fine."
4,VideoSecu Adjustable TV Wallmount,"when this product arrived I was surprised at how sturdy & durable this piece was, especially for the price. Everything was packaged great which made assemby easy. The level is an added bonus and pretty much one of the major reasons I chose this item. If I have any complaints, its that it is hard to adjust the lock in screws after you have found the position you like...and because of that I keep it at the same level all the time...If you don't have long handled screwdriver buy one before you start.I shopped around and still see several similar wallmounts at double or triple the price...."
5,TV Mount is as advertised.,"I bought this mount after seeing the outrageous prices they wanted in the stores. The mount is very sturdy and was easy to install. I did opt for using a better grade of hardware for mounting it to the studs but for the extra $3 and the cost of the mount, I was still only paying about a 3rd of what the box stores were charging."
2,"Too long for my 32"" LED TV","Lenth of this bracket is longer than my 32"" LED TV. You could see the two ends stick out. Lucky I tried it on the floor before drilling holes on my walls."
1,Bad,"The wall mount was lost, then I received it a month later in a busted up box and the screws sent with it don't even fit it. Very very unsatisfied."
4,Why was a bubble level included?,"IT works. I had to get screws because the ones with the mount were too big. Also, the bubble level is not level. You'll need a real level if you don't want your TV to lean. Otherwise, this was a good, sturdy mount for the money."
4,"Good Mount, Bad Hardware","The mount itself is very good. It is strong and well designed. The hardware they send along for mounting it on the wall is junk. The supplied hardware did not work with my TV so I had to go buy my own mounting screws to attache the TV and the lag bolts for attaching the mount to the wall just seemed cheap. The supplied lags would have probably worked, but I didn't want to risk it. I replaced them right away when I purchased the mounting screws I needed.The mount is well worth the money, but be aware you might need to make a run to the hardware store to make it work."
5,Updated Hardwear?,"Bought this mount after reading the reviews and like most others looking in the usual places (Best Buy, Target, Lowes) and finding similar mounts for $149+. The reason for my review is after reading other reviews I expected to take one on the included lag bolts to the hardwear store and buy better ones. When I opened the mount to my suprise the bolts seemed more than strong enough (I've been a mechanic for over 10 years now so I know cheap, weak bolts as soon as I pick them up). When collecting my tools to put the mount up the included instruction said a 7/16 socket would be needed. Turned out the bolt head was actually 1/2. Is it possible the manufacturer upgraded the hardwear? Otherwise a GREAT MOUNT FOR UNDER $40! Use your own judgement when it comes to the hardwear (under $5 for better bolts and piece of mind) but I used the included hardwear and put my 42 inch Panasonic plasma on it and am not the least bit concerned."
4,Very secure,"We have now bought two of these. We bought one for mounting our TV at our previous house, but left it for the new owners when we moved. I liked it enough to buy another one for mounting the TV at the new house. The only gripe I have is that there is no way to adjust the level once the back plane has been mounted, so make sure that the back plane is perfectly level when you put it up."
5,Pretty solid,well i havent gotten to use it yet but it looks very solid and it dose fit my 43 inch samsung plasma just gotta find a spot for it :)
4,Fantastic Value,"This is a heavy duty, very sturdy mount for a fantastic price. The free HDMI cable was a bonus. I'm sure glad I didn't spend $80-120 for a mount."
5,Simple mount,Had no problem with this product. They provide plenty of hardware for every scenario. I would use my own level and not the one on the stand.
5,Great Wall Mount,"I bought this mount a few months back for my new 55"" LED TV. Had no trouble installing the mount aside from finding a good spot to center it with the studs in the wall. TV mounted fine and has been up since with no problems, feels very sturdy. It does make the TV stick out quite a bit further since its an LED, but wouldn't be very noticeable with a thicker LCD TV, though to get one much thinner you would probably have to go with one of the wire based mounts. Only other problem to be aware of is the built in level on mine seemed to be inaccurate, and a few other reviews mentioned this as well, so make sure to double check it with one you know is right. Definitely a great mount and can't go wrong at all for the price. Every bit as good as ones for $100+ in the store.The included HDMI cable was also a nice bonus, not sure what the spec is but thats generally meaningless anyway. Works fine for streaming 3D video and audio."
5,glad I did this myself,Easy to follow instructions and easy to install. Tilt feature is just right. Saved a bunch of $$'s by doing this myself
4,Nice Mount...don't trust internal level,"The mount is every bit as good as any I've seen...including those sold in stores for up to $200. One thing though, the internal level is a P.O.S.! Do not trust it! There's a reason they include a second small level in the kit."
4,VideoSecu Mount,"This mount was adequate for securely mounting my 55"" Panasonic Plasma TV above my fireplace. I would certainly not spend more money on a more expensive tilting wall mount from a local store. Comes with a variety of screws for universal application."
5,Nice mount,"I mounted a 60"" LCD with no issues. The construction is sturdy and all the hardware provided worked just fine. Even the small provided level was useful...."
4,HDMI cable is bad.,The free HDMI cable is a cheap one and it creates red lines on my plasma tv when ran through a PS3. The same thing happened to a friend of mine.
3,Deceiving product image,"The image of the product would suggest that it is one piece, but the package engineers seem to have guided the actual manufacture of this product, because it is a two part.This is concerning because when mounting, I would jot want the bolting flange too close to the middle for fear of bending and the TV falling.I had to invest in butterfly anchors and bolts just to mount it, which added cost and a trip to the hardware store.I would have returned it if I didn't already schedule help lifting the tv and help hooking p each component."
4,Great Value,"Great value. Note that the main support comes in 2 pieces that get bolted together. It makes it a bit weaker, but perfectly acceptable."
5,Nice Mount,"Wall mount was easy to install and fits my TV (50"" Panasonic) with no problem. Excellent product at a very nice price."
5,Great Mount,A great mount for any price. The bubble in the mount saves time and energy. These go for 5x more at your retail store. All the hardware needed is included. Free hdmi? Can't beat that.
4,it works and is holding up.,"it works. Screws seem very durable.The balancing tool and the built in one is trash and inaccurate, I recommend using your own."
4,Quick install,Very simple wall mount system and you can't beat the price! I would use your own level given how cheap the built in level is.
4,Great buy for little$,"The price I got this for was exceptional. We had a hard time putting it together because the 6 sets of screws that were included none fit our TV, thankfully my husband had screws that did fit, and then all was great. Wish I would have researched more and got the one that could tilt side to side as well as the tilt up and down. But all in all it was a great buy."
5,Perfect Mount. Great value.,"I wondered when I ordered this if I'd be sorry. I hadn't been able to find one for less than $89 in brick and mortar stores. This mount is much nicer (built in level, plus additional level included). Solid, sturdy, easy enough installation. No regrets."
5,Worked,This item did exactly what I needed it to do and looks great in the process. I also bought the same unit for my parents tv and it worked great for them also.
5,Great Mount,"I used this product to mount a Samsung 46 inch LCD to the wall. It is sturdy and easy to assemble. The included level on the wallplate seems to be inaccurate, so make sure to use your own level. Other than that this product is perfect. It is one-third the price of similar products in the big box stores. I couldn't be happier with the ease of installation and the performance of this mount."
1,Are you trying to deceive customers hoping they won't notice?,"I got the mount quickly and initially it looked like what I ordered. Tthe trash was going out the next day, so I tear up the box and put it in the trash, then I realize it's not the same mount!!!VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount for Most 32""-60"" LCD LED Plasma, Sturdy Steel Wall Plate, Free 7 ft HDMI Cable M43The picture advertised showed a level bubble on the center of the mount. That was one of the main reasons I ordered this mount (I don't own a level) now I have to go buy one before I can mount my TV....not happy about that. When you post a picture of an item you are selling it should actually be a picture of the item. If not, you are purposely deceiving customers and that is really irritating."
3,Mounting plate could be longer,"I had a 60"" LED TV to mount and read the reviews which helped make my decision. After putting the two halves together as instructed, I found out that I could only span 2 studs because they were on 16"" centers and the mount was not long enough to hit 3. This is a major flaw in my opinion. I did not think about measuring the distance between holes on each half. Maybe I could have left them seperate and hit two studs with each half. Make sure you connect all your HDMI cables if they are in the rear because once mounted, you don't have much room to accomplish this."
4,Durable mount,This Tv wall mount is sturdy and works well and was relatively easy to mount. My only complain is the free cable that comes with it is cheap and poor quality.
4,Easy to install,"I mounted a 50"" Panasonic Plasma TV using this kit. The kit is easy to use and quick to mount. The included hardware is decent quality and multiple sizes of bolts are included to attach a TV. I would recommend a quality level and stud finder for installation. It is crucial to have to mount level and also to drive the fasteners directly to the center of the wall stud. Additionally, I drilled pilot holes to prevent splitting of any wood.Once the bracket is mounted to the wall and the TV brackets are on, be sure to hook up all required cables to the TV. There is some room behind the TV after mounting, but not much and it can be difficult to connect any cables. Also I recommend using 90 degree connectors for HDMI cables.Actually lifting and placing the TV on this mount is best done with 3 people - two to hold the TV and one to look in back to guide the TV on the wall."
5,Still holding up..,"I mean, either it works or it doesn't. This works well. Doesn't have much space behind it, so you can't notice the gap between the TV and the wall. It was also easy to install."
4,Great product for the price.,"I purchased this wall mount for my SHARP 40'' flat screen tv. It was easy to install and works great! I did use my own screws after reading the reviews. I also feel that it sits a little bit further off of the wall than other wall mounts I have seen. However, I am very happy with his product and would purchase another or recommend it to a friend."
4,goodV,Very nice quality and very easy to use. Had a little problem matching the holes to the back of the TV for the hight I wanted.
4,Low price - good product,I like this product.. doing the great job for the lowest price in the market...
5,Great mount for a great price!,Super easy to install. This product is sturdy and affordable. I have 3 of these in my home and they all work great!
5,great,This mount fits a variety of sizes making it easy to use. My brother in law put it up with a minimum of bad words. What could be higher praise?
3,60 inch,You have to assemble this and align the two sections. The tools provided are not sufficient and you will need your own simple tools. Once assembled and mounted into studs it will work well.
4,seems okay,"Well, our 46"" television is still attached to the wall, and that's all that I was really concerned about, so I'm happy."
3,decent product and good price,"this was a good price for an o.k. product. being that it can support up to a 40 inch tv it is a very large bracket. so if you have a 37 inch tv, then the end of the bracket sticks out past the side of the tv quite a bit. not a very good look. next time I'll spend a few nore bucks and get the model with a small backplate and swivel as well as tilt."
4,Very good product for the money!,"I purchased this wall mount bracket for use with my 42"" VISIO flat panle TV. The fact that it could be tilted downward was importent to me and is a big reason why I purchased it. The mount is sturdy, well made, and installation is a snap with one exception. I could not use any of the wall mounting hardware that came in the box. Oh, there is plenty of hardware provided, all in neat little packaging, but none that I could use. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5-stars in my review. So, it was off to Lowes where I purchased what I needed for about $5. When I returned, it took about 20-minutes to get the bracket anchored to the wall and the TV attached. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. You can't beat it for the price!"
5,Good buy!,"Bought it for a 47"" vizio, and it holds up very well. Only recommendation would be to go to a hardware store and buy better bolts. I had read other reviews about the bolts just breaking/snapping, so I decided not to chance it and automatically bought a few better quality bolts. I still gave it five stars because even with buying a few screws you cant beat the price/quality of this mount!"
4,wall TV,"I was very satisfied with the hanger, it was very well made and easy to install. I had a stud finder so it made the job easier, my suggestion would be to put a STUD FINDER in the package instead of the bevel level because it has a little built in bubble level that worked just fine. Although I did check the level with my own 24"" level. The HDMI cable they sent also for me was a waste since I already had a HDMI hook up. So I guess what I'm saying is they could give you a stud finder instaed of the HDMI cable and the bevel level. The only time I really needed a helping hand is when I lifted my 42"" TV up to slide the bracket on to the hanger, it's a little hard to see the bracket when you're lifting the TV to attach it. I am very satisfied with the hanger and would recommend it to my friends. You couldn't beat the price on AMAZON and the delivery time, considering it was free shipping, was good."
4,"Good price, decent unit",I would buy this again. Came with all the mounting screw options and an HDMI cable as well as bubble levels. I am satisfied with this unit.
5,Good sturdy mount.,"The mount was exactly as described. It mounted to the wall with little difficulty. There are several mounting options, including lag bolts, and expanding plastic sleeves with screws. Instructions were easy to follow, with installation taking about 15 minutes. I would recommend this economical product to anyone looking."
4,TV Wall Mount,This product was simple to install and the price was unbelievable in comparison to discount stores. It also arrived promptly!
5,INEXPENSIVE AND DURABLE,"It's worth every penny, don't get hyped on those $200 wall mounts. Because of the price it doesn't make it the best wall mount on the market, this is the reason why I always come to Amazon for the same type frame in the $30's range I get the same quality as the one they have at Best Buy which by the way have it for for over fifty bucks. Avoid brick and mortar stores whenever possible..Great Investment and holds up strong for my 46"" LCD screen."
5,Perfect for my TV,"I recently purchased a 60"" Plasma TV. I found this wall mount on Amazon. It worked perfectly. I can't understand why someone would pay hundreds of dollars for the SAME thing you can get online for a fraction of the cost. The quality of the mount is great and the mounting is extremely easy. Don't waste your money paying someone to mount your flat screen TV. Do it yourself and save a ton of money. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Great mount but there was one issue,"Got this mount for the Panasonic Viera TH-50PZ850U. Unfortunately, none of the screws included were long enough to work with this model of television, which is why I did not give the mount 5 stars. Fortunately, I was able to go to lowe's and get 4 m8 x 1.25 40 bolts for $3 and the problem was solved. Anyone with this t.v. model should be aware of this issue. Otherwise, the mount is solid, well made, and sits close to the wall despite the tilting mechanism. I have not tried to tilt the t.v., but the mechanism appears functional. The included hdmi cable is also a plus."
4,excellent value,"Kit quite complete including an assortment of screws to match bolt holes in many TVs. Nice design - easy to install without having to support TV for long. Adjustable tilt works well. Adequate construction. No complaints. Highly recommended. Saw similar in Target for $90, $199 in Best Buy!."
3,slotted holes,No holes are on the common spacing. I had to use slotted holes for the top and bottom mounting screws. The TV mounting screws provided are the wrong length for my TV. Overall I have never been more disappointed in a product. It will be returned.
3,Ya Get What Ya Pay For,"Do not trust the level that's incorporated in the unit as it was way off. To tighten down the screws that keep the TV from moving horizontaly I had to buy a 10"" screw driver to reach the screws even with the tilt feature. Otherwise it's OK considering the price, but do not trust the level!"
2,Videosecure Tilt TV Wall Mount.,This product did not have the correct length vertical bracket monuting screws.I had to buy them to install the vertical bracket to the back of my Panasonic 40 inch plasma TV.
3,TV too big?,"Read previous reviews so I bought it. I have a 60 inch plasma and because of the size, I was not able to tilt it very much. I can see that it would work bette with a smaller tv, 50 inch or less, but do not recommend it for very large tvs. Wall mount was sturdy and can easily hold my heavy plasma."
2,Not usable with my TV,"While this is a solidly built unit, it was of no use to me. My 32"" Panasonic has its mounting screw holes 3 15/16"" apart; the holes on the mount mismatch by 9/32"" in either direction. A well-designed mount would have some elongated mounting holes to allow for this, but on this one all the holes are circular and have equal spacing."
3,You Need new screws,This is a sturdy mount but believe me YOU NEED TO BUY HEAVY DUTY SCREWS. I tried putting in the screws that came with the mount and it broke in half while I was screwing it. Other than that it is a pretty good mount
2,Thats not tilting to me,"Everything was great about this mount execpt that for my 37inch TV for my child's room, it tilted down maybe 1 or 2 degrees... not nearly enough to be angled correctly for a short child. Everything else was great, but I'm a bit unhappy that its really not going to work in that room... take notice that you can't tilt this much at all."
3,"Not for for TVs less than 40""","Fist of all, all TV mounts are made up of solid steel or metal,so quality of construction is going to be the best. Installation was a breeze! But only issue is that I have 32"" TV and those vertical brackets which goes in the back of TV are longer than the dimension of TV. So when you install the TV on wall, those vertical brackets sticks out at the top and are clearly visible. That's not acceptable!! So I will have to take them out of TV and chop them out in my garage so that they hide in the back.So I would not recommend this model with TVs less than 40"". It is reasonably priced,but its not worth the hassle."
3,TV Mount,"Product is fine. This unit is really too large for the 32"" Flat Screen Monitor because the mount stick out too much. It look overly large for that size screen. We plan to return (1) unit of this item, which we did not unpack."
5,VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount for HDTV,"I purchased this to have sent direct to my brother's house since I purchased him a 37"" HDTV as an early Christmas gift. He called when he received it and I made plans on taking the TV and visit for a few days. We were both amazed of how well made the wall mount was and even more amazed as to how easy it was to install. It had the built in level so all we had to do was use his electronic stud finder to measure and mark off the wall location for mounting. We wanted the tilted angle for his bedroom and with the locking screws there is no chance that the TV section hooks of the mount to fall off the wall section by accident. It even can with a HMDI cable. We were both very pleased. I actually ordered another for myself for a 40"" for my own bedroom."
4,Still a Solid deal,"Given the price of the purchase, I was very hesitant to buy this product seeing how I just spent $200.00 on a swivel slide bracket for my 42"" over a year and a half ago but Amazon has been good to me for the most part so I rolled with it. Then I found out that Walmart was selling just the bracket up to a 70"" (Swivel only) I believe for $45.00 a couple of weeks ago. Thanks for the advise on the screws, going to get some heavy duty screws today. The only disappointment that I have with the purchase is the HDMI cable. I thought I was getting a 9' one, but it turns out the cable is actually a 7' one. Oh well, it was free, and I can still make this work. Thanks."
4,Buy another HDMI cable,"Nice packaging and it arrived safely. The wall mount seemed sturdy and well made. It was easy to install with all the necessary hardware. However, the HDMI cable did not work; no signal at all. Be safe and buy an HDMI cable because the one included here is a throw away."
3,Gets the job done,"It works good for my 50"" tv. Feels secure and hugs wall. The only problem is I had to connect all wires to tv before mounting and if I want to add or remove wires I will have to take tv off wall. So if you have to get to connections behind tv often I would not recomend this product. Note..This is the first wall hugger mount I installed, so it may be like that for all the others. If that is the case then this will work like the others."
5,Loving this Product,"I love this product. I was a little skeptical due to the price... but I must admit I am happy so far. The device and all the hardware included is very sturdy and there is no need for finding or buying alternative bolts or screws. I have purchased two of these and It fits both televisions; including the cheap one(proscan brand). The installation was easy. once you get the bracket installed the rest is a piece of cake. It can tilt slightly (which is perfect for me), but if you are looking for a major tilt, I would recommend using another brand. If you are looking for a system that is resonably priced, yet strong and sturdy, this may be the one for you."
4,"Works great- 50"" plasma",I used a backboard of plywood fastened to the wall; then fastened this hanger to the plywood for extra strength. It works very well and I've had no problems. Very sturdy installed and easy to mount/unmount the TV.
5,Buy this one!,"I looked at Best Buy, and I looked around the web for a thin wall mount for my 40"" LCD. For the price, you simply cannot beat this mount! I had my TV up inside of 30 minutes and was enjoying the TV, instead of fighting with installation.Do yourself a favor and order this mount! When you place the order though, get yourself some decent 2-2.5"" wood/drywall screws and maybe a pack of washers. As reviewed the ones that come with this are for masonry not wood studs, but wood screws have narrow heads. So...washers for the heads, (I honestly used four strange square plates that came with it) and wood screws for your studs.The built in level is pretty accurate, and I double checked it with a nice carpentry one, screws spaced well, appearance is great, tilt adjust-ability could be easier and you'll want a long handled screw driver to make tighten down the safety bolts. HDMI cable is nice quality too."
5,"Great wall mount for Sharp 52"" TV","Great wall mount for 52 inch TV, I could only hit one stud but was able to get stronger screws for drywall attachment."
5,great product,tv fits perfect looks great and hangs great against the wall it came fast in the mail i love this wall mount
3,not quite what I expected,I don't think this delivers what the label says. I brought a 65 inch tv and moved my 50 inch one. in the end I didn't trust this one with the new tv as it looked and felt a bit flimsy when at its maximum extension. it's doing fine with the 50 inch tv though.
2,VideoSecu Tilt TV Wall Mount,"I used this product on a 50"" Panasonic Plasma. It worked ok but it seems a little light weight for this size TV. I would say that it is ok for smaller TV's up to about 42"" and or the lighter LED models."
5,Greta product,"It was easy to install with good directions. My 46"" Samsung TV almost hugs the wall. I had to use longer than supplied lag screws for wall mounting since the wall was different from normal construction."
4,VERY VERY VERY GOOD,It is very good but I think that Dana Carvey was even better in The SNL types. But I also liked this one maybe not as much but a was very good. I think if you lick Dana Carvey you should buy it.
3,April Moon: Anthology,I love the anthologies. Keep your great authors collaborating on these. They do not have to be for the holidays only. The condensed versions make for great reading.Thanks all authors who collaborate with wonderful heartfelt stories.
5,Still a great item,Converted my multi-speed hybrid to a single-speed in August. No problems with it at all. Been recommending it to others who were looking to convert their multi-speed bikes to single-speeds.
2,The game serves it purpose,"I wished the bingo ""paper chips"" didn't have letters on them. It's a bit maddening to try to find the letter chip to match the letter that has be called out. I wish I had gotten a different spanish bingo game."
4,"Quality product, fast delivery","Bought a few boxes for my mother-in-law. She says the ginseng quality is good, my wife's pleased, I'm happy. Will buy again."
4,What is Sensory Integration?,"This book explains very clearly the problem of sensory integration dysfunction. It examines the cause, and the scope of the problem, and also treatment. It clearly states that this problem can occur despite a parent's proper nurturing of a child's development. Most encouraging, this book explains the therapy that can help the child (or adult). However, it is written by a PhD, and so is rather difficult to understand at times. It also covers a huge scope of learning disability, from slight dysfunction to autism."
5,Must Read,"If you have a young child with learning difficulties and want to understand the nature of your child's problem, definitely read this book. I found it invaluable in understanding my child's problems."
4,Achieving the Pinochle Pinnacle!,"Gibson lays out the mistakes players make as well as explaining the successful strategies of both Three-handed and Auction Pinochle, as well as short chapters on two and four-handed. It is an easy and encouraging read for the novice, and includes many examples of hands played so you can follow along. The discussion of when to bluff, and his guidelines for deciding whether to shoot the moon would be helpful to more experienced players as well."
1,TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME,"Title has nothing to do with book, as noted on other comments. Not about interfaith at all. In fact, the book is quite anti-Semitic - the Jewish ex-boyfriend is portayed, very directly, as having almost no redeeming qualities. ""hypocrite"", untalented, unsuccessful, etc. No discussion of WHY he wanted his kids to be Jewish - only that he was a jerk.furthermore, the book is really not about anything at all. There is no maturation or depth to character. Author's first book and it shows."
3,Confessions of a Nervous Shiksa,"Initially when I started reading this book I wasn't sure I was going to finish it. It was very depressing, (yeah, I know that all break ups are depressing but...) and the main character seemed very shallow. The fact that she was also mean to the poor dog with cancer was something I just couldn't get past, hence 3 stars. I started to get bored by her continual self pity and the movie scenes but them I began to find them interesting. I also found myself rooting for her to find someone and be happy (Kirk maybe). Then when she decided to go life without men for a while I realized that maybe she had learned something from her rough time. Maybe she had grown up. She wasn't as shallow and self centered as I had initially thought."
2,Denewood Bench,The bench was damaged upon arrival. Didn't want to go through the hassel of sending it back. Put it together and we are using it while it lasts. Would have been a decent product if it had not been broken upon arrival. The backrest piece had a section of the lattice work broken out and there was also a crack in it.
2,Fast and Loose with the Facts,"An interesting commentary on the modern American lawn. Movie did a good job of keeping my attention and it was actually enjoyable to watch. Numerous ""facts"" were give throughout the movie; however, citations were not provided. Many factually inaccurate comments."
2,Get the extreme white version instead.,"I'm a bit of a fanatic with auto lighting, and I've used most bulbs on the market at one time or another. I have IPF fat boy bulbs with a custom wiring harness in my Jeep and in the snow they are very bright and produce a lot of glare. I had the PIAA extreme whites in my fog lamps and thought I'd give these a try as the intention was to use them only in the snow and fog. Granted, in the fog lights there is virtually no glare to begin with, but I'm always interested in something better. I know that the whole ""yellow light works better in fog"" is a debunked myth, but I tried these anyway. Why not?These are not good at all. OK, they are better than stock bulbs, but I am much happier with the PIAA extreme whites. I really can't think of a case where these would be better. You don't really get less glare with the plasma color, just less light."
2,quality has gone to crap,"It has been about 5 years since I have used piaa bulbs and past experience was great. Now the qualitysucks plain and simple. 1st bulb lasted 3 days the other one went out 2 weeks later. I never ran the plasma bulbs before had the coated lenses. Went to these cause the Hella yellow stars are not even close, but at least they have lasted and are now back in use(bought them last winter). Truthfully the piaa's are not as yellow as I thought they would be but do get less glare back in the snow and rain. Time for piaa's customer service and I to have a long talk. Once the rally bar is done for the Focus there will be Hella's mounted on there not piaa."
4,Piaa foglights h3 bulbs only,"Not as bright as the claimed (being equivalent to a 85watt bulb) and probably half of the yellow tint that one would expect for a fog, but I think that is beneficial."
2,Difficult to Finish,"The subject matter is tedious to begin with so you can't fault the writer for that. I found this book very difficult to get through and I am not sure why. I felt that many of the grammatical and usage explanations were incomplete. I think there are numerous errors and inconsistencies in the answer key. I found the chronic use of the progressive tense annoying and more frequent than contemporary Italian usage. This book has excellent word lists and great appendices. When I finally finished, I pulled those pages out of the book, punched holes in them and added them to my Italian grammar notebook. If you actually write the exercises in the book, it will be a mess when you're done. If you plan on reusing this one, do the exercises on a separate piece of paper. You may need a dictionary to complete the exercises."
5,Italian Prepositions and Pronouns,Italian prepositions and pronouns are a very important of the language and they do require a separate exercise book. This is a particularly good one. The exercises are excellent and I enjoy referring to the book constantly.
1,Description is for what?,"Not a clue what item the description is supposed to be for, but it's not for this product! Battery life? Operating temperature? It's supposed to be a pitman arm puller. What is the minimum/maximum jaw opening? How much more wrong could this description be?"
4,Perfect,I needed something for the muscles in my neck. This is the perfect shape. Both pads hit the correct areas. A bit noisy when new batteries are used.
1,stop selling vhs,this man barley can sing or act a lick. everyday my sister makes me watch doc and now i am almost crazy as a coon. this is like watching a dog taking a dump. for you people that like this show it comes on dish at 12 noon on channel 9403 but i says house is better if you agree with me e-mail or write your own review THANKS
2,Billy Ray Cyrus 1992 video,"I ordered this VHS video of Billy Ray Cyrus and I enjoyed his interview but I was hoping to see more of his music videos on it. This video only has 2 music videos like ""Achy Breaky Heart"" and one other one. It is also very short, only 23 minutes. I'm glad it was ""sold cheap"" otherwise any more of a price it would not have been worth it."
5,exellent epic escapist science fiction,"I can definitely count Kage Baker as one of my favorite authors (as well as Daniel Keys Moran and Dan Simmons). I have enjoyed all of the company novels and this was no exception. The storyline is quite complex and has some of the most well developed and intricate characters that I have ever read; they also possess a quality that most characters in novels recently have lacked: you actually care what happens to them and how they evolve! So to the person who said ""Baker may be losing his grip on the plot"" well ... first of all if you have truly READ the books you would know that Kage Baker is a LADY and second, the story is only expanding and becoming truly intricate. Thank you and good night!"
2,thoroughly unimpressed,"The premise is that there are a number of immortal cyborgs doing mostly nothing for decades. They have amazing nano-repair robots inside them and can deal with anyhting except chocolate... (very likely. NOT) Then there are these two cyborgs who want to find out what happened to a certain Mendoza who never shows up in the book. So they spend a couple of centuries on this. Towards the end some troglodyte branch of humanity shows up, who have amazing science and have been hiding from humanity for many thousands years. (Why were they hiding if they are so superior?)There was no reason to care for any of these characters. The story has no logic, coherence or plausibility to it. Side characters come and go without any reason for them to be there."
3,Great Movie - No English subtitles,"The picture and sound quality were fine. However, the DVD does not contain English subtitles as listed on the website."
3,"Great movie, sh*tty DVD","I saw this film theatrically, and it's a wonderful, New Wave story of a group of misfit ticket collectors in the Budapest metro system. However, its groundbreaking combination of music and imagery is totally lost on Thinkfilm's worthless DVD, which dumps a crappy 4:3 transfer into viewers' laps as if there hadn't been any advances in the eight years that DVD has been around. Add to that non-removable subtitles, a two-channel stereo soundtrack (the theatrical feature was a lively 5.1) and no extras, and you have a DVD throwback to public domain titles of 1997. Rent it or see it in theatres. Don't buy it."
4,"Quirky portrayal of normal, dysfunctional people","I highly recommend this movie for individuals who enjoy tales of fallen heroes, believe in redemption and can appreciate the absurd.The movie created this incredibly compelling world of the Budapest underground with gorgeous stylized cinematography, silly characters, and a nicely paced adventure. The sound track is fun too.For best viewing pleasure watch in the late pm; helps to get into the mood of the film."
1,ED WOOD LIVES,"Remember the name Conrad Glover-he wrote,directed,produced and stars in this piece of guano that makes 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' look like 'Citizen Kane'. The sound is hollow, the production values are nil, the script is beyond idiotic, and the cast can't even be referred to as actors and watch the characters playing the rich parents of two kidnapped girls-they dress and look as if they were cast at a soup kitchen on skid row. Another classic piece of casting involves the police detective investigating the two missing girls-she has longer dredlocks than the alien from the Predator movies, and is scarier. Please, please, please Mr Glover don't make any more movies."
2,Frustrated,Book was slow in arriving. Read the whole thing only to find out at the end that the last 2 or more pages were missing. Frustrating!
4,Sad Ending to Innocent lives,"This is an excellent version of what was in the newspapers, and it was well written as it invoked the sentimental feelings that come into play when we read or witness something as horrendous as this. It is so sad, that the little girl's body is still not found, and hope the father will see through his failings and atleast identify where her body is.Excellent read, i will recommend this book to anyone"
4,Groundbreaking Soundtrack,"Well when I first heard that Hype Williams-one of the biggest hip-hop music directors in the world- was going to make a movies I knew the soundtrack was going to be awesome. However I didn't think it would be this good.The reason I believe this album was so good was because Ja Rule, Mr. Vegas, Drag-On, Beanie Seagle, Memphis Bleek, and many other artist were all on this album before they blew up. Not to mention the other headbanger songs like ""The Boom"" f/ DMX, and Mr. Vegas.I would love to individually name all the good songs on the album however that would be pointless, because I would just be listing all the tracks.Again, one of the things that drew me to this album was the there were songs on there with Drag-on. This song has not even been released as a single yet. There are also good R&B songs and the Wu-Tang clan makes an apperance. This album is worth the money, and you should check it out."
3,Help me please,"Can someone please let me know what the song was in the stripclub, the female reggae song? I have been dying to get that song for the longest time. Thanks! please email me at thepeoplesbum@hotmail.com!"
4,coo,It is a good cd but it could use a little more of dmx. He is the best rapper and it is his movie so he should be in more than 2 songs
4,It was a very good Selection of rap artist like the movie.,I thought that it was a good view of their lives how they see it. Belly had a lot of cursing but it was a very good albam. It had alot of rap and hip-hop artist and it was all hard core and very interesting.
4,"DMX , NAS , METH , JA RULE , WU-TANG , JAY-Z , BLEEK ,LOX !","BUY THIS ALBUM NOW IT'S ALITTLE OLD NOW BUT STILL IF YOU NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE YOUR GOING TO LOVE IT AND PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I SWEAR TO YOU.HERES THE GOOD TRACKS 2,3,8,9,11.GOOD EAST COAST ALBUM."
2,Surprise Surprise,"When I heard that the movie Velvet Goldmine was about glam rock, I had to check out the soundtrack. I adore glam! But I was thinking along the lines of the New York Dolls (a cover of their song 'Personality Crisis' done by Teenage Fanclub hardly counts), Mott the Hoople, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, or Slade... None of which were on this record, to my huge dismay (No BOWIE?). This was a quite a disappointment of a collection of ""glam classics"". There are a few gems on here, but not enough to be worth the money."
2,Very uneven,"I got this cd becasue one i am a fan of glam rock, it was a good price and i am a fan or radioehead. How can you have soundtrack that is about the glam rock scene of the 70s and not include bowie. All of the covers are not nearly as good as the originals. The only good songs are Virgina Plain and Satelite of Love and Camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready. The songs of Venus and Furs dispointed me it seem Thom was trying to sound like Bryan Ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice. If you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest Hedwig and The Angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today. That soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds. I ended up selling it for more then i paid for it."
5,It's sooo good!,Oh my god. I absolutely love this. It totally captures the essnce of all it was portraying. And the music takes me back to the glittery days of glam rock.
4,Cosmic Dancer,"Ok, i bought the cd a week after becoming totally and absolutely obsessed with the film, and i listen to a couple tracks at least once a day. I even spend most of my time getting the originals of the songs on the album that were covers. It is one of the best albums that i own, and it definitely is a great record to start with if you are interested in listening to glam music."
5,Ok movie...Awesome soundtrack,Although I wasn't too impressed by the movie I LOVED the soundtrack. A good mix of early glam greats and faux early glam soundalikes. I listen to the CD until I'm sick of it and then go through the same cycle a few weeks later.
2,"Almost Interesting, yet bland, plot & characters.","Robinson is vastly overrated. Nevertheless, the plot in this novel is a little better than most of his novels. Characters are etched with a vagueness that undermines the possibility of depth and ambiguity of character, that Robinson, I suspect, thinks he is creating. Main problem is Banks--Robinson thinks that facts about Banks's life--divorce, former girlfriend on force, long-range relationship, living alone etc--creates a complex, edgy character, but what the reader gets is detective that moves shallow and superficially through the novel. Robinson succeeds much better with a one-time character--the gallant lad whose heroin addicted girlfriend dies--very good portrait of angst filled young man, dealing with life, authentic personality-- his anger is vivid. I liked art expert characterization also. But Banks, female cop, cliched doctor, painter just sit there, dull and uninvolving. Forgettable novel. Highly forgettable."
1,Just to boring to finish,"Sorry all your Robinson fans, but this one left me so bored that I just could not finish it. Some of the characters grabbed me and tried to pull me in, but then I'd get pushed out again. Some of the writting style was confusing as was the British language references. It took me some time to step into this style novel, and actually, I just never stepped far enough. Didn't enjoy this one, and if all of Robinson's books are this style, I'd have to say I won't be reading any more of them. But you guys enjoy it if it's your thing!"
1,Playing with Fire,Kept waiting for the plot to develop. It did not. deleted after a few chapters. Glad it didn't cost much!
3,Not a bad story but too much emphasis on the characters personal lives,"A good many years ago, S. S. Van Dyne in setting rules for writing a detective novel very definitely ruled out any love interest for the detective. He (or she) was there to solve a puzzle and nothing else. That rule seems to have gone by the board. In way too many stories today the emphasis has shifted from the puzzle to the detective's personal life..And that's the problem with Playing with Fire. It's not a bad story, but too many references to the main detective's previous affair with his female co-detective and other personal matters--all of which presume a knowledge of previous books in the series--get in the way."
2,I did not like any of the characters,I did not like any of the characters. It was not so bad I stopped reading but it was hard to finish. It was far to predictable.
4,"Another Good Robinson Effort, Though Not His Best","Unless it's drop-dead terrible, I automatically give Robinson four stars for a book, but this was not really his best. Still four stars, but barely. I can always count on Robinson to give a book that earns my respect and admiration, both for the plot and the characterization. Chief Inspector Banks is a great character, a good cop, a troubled, conflicted, complex guy. His problems with ex-wife Sandra and his main squeeze of the moment -- often a co-worker -- make him eminently human. A Robinson/Banks book usually falls into a pattern and it's not unusual that you will detect who the bad guy is before the novel ends. But the joy comes from Robinson's artistry in richly weaving a tale that keeps you engrossed."
4,Inspector Banks,"I am a reader of the ""Rebus"" novels also, and I believe that the Inspector Banks series is almost as good - Banks is not as dark, nor as interesting, a character as Rebus, and I believe that Rebus is better drawn; however the plot lines, and the twists and turns are as good, and I think the finishes are actually better than they are for the Rebus series"
4,Peter Robinson Triumphs Again,"In my view, Peter Robinson is one of our greatest writers of detective fiction: in his Alan Banks' novels, he has created a complex, interesting man struggling with his issues. I am reading all of his Alan Banks novels chronologically, which I recommend because he refers to prior events in Banks' life, events that will not be as meaningful to the reader if he has not read the prior novels. In ""Playing with Fire"" Robinson intrigues us with a series of fires that have claimed lives. Are we dealing with an arsonist or could these fires be cleverly planned attempts to murder the victims? As Banks pursues his investigation, the reader is swept up in exciting events, one of which almost costs Banks his life. Robinson is in top form here as we join him in unravelling a fascinating mystery and in further developing the pains and pleasures of Banks' life in Yorkshire."
4,Inspector Banks solved another.,"I love UK mysteries, and enjoy this series, particularly the interactions among the team. This one didn't disappoint me, although it did Annie."
4,Playing with fire,great read. Love the whole banks series. Saw the twist coming a little early on but excellent sub plots and characters kept this as compellingly page turning as anything Robinson has written.
2,Hes the best cop. Just ask him,Another book about a NYPD who thinks hes the best. The stories he tells are dull and have been told hundreds of times before. Too many cops talk about as unflawed. What happened to Joe Wambaugh
1,Are you kidding me.,"I had Bill McCarthy as a professer. He is a brillient man but not at all modest. He uses the time of all the classes he teaches, Ethics, operations, sociology, and others to boast on his accoplishments. Unfortunetly if you buy half of what he deals out you are the biggest fool. His book is a five star fiction but to call it a life story is a joke."
4,4 Star Fiction.,"Well written, interesting subject, great cops & robbers yarn. It was fun to read but I dont believe a word of it. I dont know cops like McCarthy. The cops I know try to bust tourists taking photos of the cruise boats at the docks, or slam old ladies against walls at the airport, or drive around in squad cars marked SEAT BELT ENFORCEMENT UNIT. I know, I work with cops every day. Cops naturally seek out and exploit 'easy money' rather than adventures like McCarthy's."
4,Not bad for the price,"For what I paid, I am fairly happy with it. The main compartment has an adjustable divider to be sized to your laptop. No sipper on the inside pouch, so if you flip the top all the way open, your stuff can fall out. If you travel with your laptop a lot, I would go with one of the more heavy duty models, the sides on this one are a little flimsy. This is padded, but not bulletproof. All in all, a good value for what it costs, but if I was on the road alot I would get something a little bit beefier."
4,Quality DVD Recording at a Reasonable Price,"The DVDs are heavy enough to be sturdy. The picture quality after recording is very good, much better than I thought it would be. Its printable surface produces very nice lable images and text. The price is very reasonable. I had heard bad things about Memorex tapes, discs, etc., but whatever I had heard was either wrong, or the company has now solved the old problems. I like the DVDs very much, and would definitely recommend them to others."
3,DVD Back-up review,The Memorex DVD-Rs were received in an appropriate amount of time properly packaged. The quality from memorex is always good. I like the printable DVDs to better make the labels. Regular DVDs and stickon labels change are thicker and sometimes do not work. Good product and good price.
1,WORST Amazon experience EVER,"After ordering the Memorex DVD-R 16x 4.7GB 100 Pack Spindle Printable from ANTOnline - and finding out (after 30 days, of course) that at least 80% of these disks are DEFECTIVE - I might advise anyone else who is thinking of buying these to be sure it is from a reputable business. I have to write off the $43.00 that this cost me - but I am hoping that it saves someone else the aggravation!"
1,They just will not record never mind print....,I've used Memorex for years with no problems until now! Not one disc will record. Enough said!
5,most reliable I have found,"The memorex 16X d DVD printablbes are the most reliable DVD's I have ever used. I have used over 1000 and had less than 5 coasters,which were my falt."
4,Not the best but very good,A few issues with these but still good enough for my needs. Dont think I will be buying anymore of these. I am sticking with Vermatim.
2,Memorex- 16x4 DVD-r,The quality of the DVD is the worst I ever encountered; approximatey 20% turn into shiny coasters; the flaw where pixelation can be seen on the recorded surface as a discolored band. I don't think I will be getting Memorex products for a while.
3,damaged in shipping,"I have used the Memorex printables for several Amazon orders and usually have little or no problem with the discs. The last shipment was from the ""other sellers"" catagory because Amazon was unfortunately out of stock. Consequently the ""other seller"" was B&H photo/video. Their price was high but they had them. The discs came with a smashed and broken plastic spindle container that obviously was not packed well enough to survive the handling by the trucking company. I had to take all the discs and transfer them to my previously purchased spindle container. The discs seem ok. Just a hassle. B&H should ship more carefully. My previous purchase came from another ""other seller"": ANTonline, and it arrived in perfect condition. Watch out for poor shipping when ordering from B&H."
2,Does not work with SONY DRU-510A,"I bought these because they were a great price and had good reviews. Unfortunately, 7 out of the 9 discs that I tried to burn this afternoon ended up in the trash. Another reviewer mentioned that these discs did not work with their 2-year-old SONY - I guess that's my story as well. I just ordered a newer SONY drive.It may partly be due to my burner, but I had just finished burning through 50 Memorex discs that worked fine with my old 4X SONY. I guess these discs are different. I am going to wait until my new drive gets here tomorrow before trying any more of these discs.--------------------------------------Edit:My new SONY drive works wonderfully with these DVDs. I have burned about 25 of them with no problems.Sony DRU830A 18x Internal Dual-Layer DVD Burner"
1,Coasters,"The spindle of these were purchased at a Sam's Club and so far out of 55 discs, 22 have been unplayable or misburned. These discs were a waste of money and time, it would be better spent on another brand. It seems Memorex quality had gotten worse and worse over the years."
1,Ring of Death!!!,"About 5mm from the center of the recordable area of these discs is a noticeable thin ring. This ring ruins the burning process, looking like only half a dvd was created in the recordable area. I've gone through 2 50packs where this ring is not there and have had no problems. No choice but to avoid Memorex now and spread the word.. cheap for a reason now unfortunately. Not worth the chance."
1,Doesn't work well in DVD player,"I've had this problem before, but forgot and bought Memorex again. Recorded movies seem to work well in a computer, but on my DVD player they are unreadable. Probably about 1/4 of them were bad. You may suspect I have a bad DVD player, but I haven't had any problems with other brands. There is always the possibility my DVD player is getting weak, but there's no denying that so far I've only had problems with Memorex."
3,Print to Center Not As Expected,"Technically, the DVDs are excellent and available at a great price, but the printable center hub is so opaque that it almost seems pointless to call it ""print to center."" There's other DVDs, Maxell, for instance, where the center hub coating is as dense (or seems to be) at the center as on the rest of the DVD. This makes printing a light-colored design on the DVD much more effective. If this isn't important to you, this DVD is a great buy, but my DVD design is subtle and I've had to buy other DVDs to have a more effective design."
1,WE DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PRINT ON THESE HOW CAN THEY BE CALLED PRINTABLE,I ORDERED THESE BECAUSE THEY SAID PRINTABLE. I HAVE A EPSON PRINTER THAT DOES DVD'S BUT WE CAN'T PRINT ON THESE LIKE WE HAVE ON OTHERS. DID WE JUST GET A MISMARKED BUNCH OR WHAT IS GOING ON. WE HAVE NEVER HAD TROUBLE WITH PRINTABLE ONES BEFORE.
3,Which ones will you receive?,"I have used about 3 of these so far. The work really good. Never a bad burn, but the surface is where the problem is. You might get the Nice glossy finish or you might end up with the horrible matte finish. The matte finish when printed is not any where as nice as the glossy. I went to CompUSA and had them open a few and they were all different. The all have the same label and UPC. I have found out that Memorex buys disc's from a few different manufactures and repackages them.So - it a fifty/fifty chance you might end up with the nice GLOSS FINISH."
1,Not good at all!,I have used 17 disks now and haven't got one to print good at all! these Disks suck bigger than I've ever had before!
1,Two Issues,"Issue number one is that the printable surface does NOT seem to be as bright and clean as other brands. That would have dropped it to 4 stars.Issue number two is that the stack that I received had been previously opened and TAPED closed. Not adequate for shipping as the thin spacers at the top of the stack were not there. Some were within the plastic, some were missing entirely. That brings a one star for the vendor.The plastic cover is all but stripped.The disks are working. I have not had one fail yet (most failures in my experience is when the computer is trying to do too many things and fails to be ready with the next segment of data to be burned).Not positive I got 100, but close enough to not bother shipping it back, but I will never reorder from this listing. Other brands look better after printing and I don't have to fear they have been opened and so poorly re-packaged. July 2012"
4,Everyone should make their own ice cream,"If you have access to a lot of fruit, an electric ice cream maker (one where you don't need ice or salt) is a super simple way to make frozen sorbets and creamy ices in the middle of the hot summer. Once you get the hang of it, you can mix a batch and have it in the mixer in about 10 minutes, with fresh sorbet or ice cream ready to eat in 30 minutes more. This factory-reconditioned machine was indistinguishable from new. The only problem I have with this Cuisinart machine is that it is very loud. But maybe they are all like that. Another great thing about making your own is you can make it completely organic, and in the case of sorbets, out of spring water if you prefer. For making raspberry sorbet, a Victorio strainer is indespinsible."
4,"So far, so good (but LOUD!)","The peach frozen yogurt recipe is delicious! I freeze what we don't eat that night, and if I'm feeling like yogurt for dessert, I just put the container in the fridge 2-3 hours before you dessert time, and it softens up just enough to be perfect.Ice cream turns out pretty good so far. The Premium Vanilla recipe they give isn't quite as sweet or smooth as store-bought(maybe future attempts will make it better). I followed the suggestions that I read here about thoroughly freezing the bowl, and cooling the mixture first. You do need to re-freeze the mixture for at least an hour (2 is better) to get the right consistancy.My only complaint so far is that it is LOUD!! It seems like such a simple motor, I don't know why it would need to make such a racket. I think other people have mentioned this, so I'll assume that it is not a problem with my re-conditioned model.Overall, though, I would definitely recommend this machine, especially for the price."
4,"If you love ice cream, you've got to have one of these","This ice cream maker is quieter and far less hassle than every other ice cream maker I've had or used. No ice, no rock salt, no sloshy mess of heavily salted water that needs to be disposed of. And, if you're freezer's cold enough, you can make ice cream every day.Comes with a handful of recipes and instructions on how to make other recipes work in the machine. Easy to clean (just spray down the cold container and insert with hot water and let dry) and even easier to use. My only complaint is that it's too darned small. Four servings sure go quick. It'd be nice to be able to rip out another batch of ice cream as soon as the first one's done but the cold container is pretty much a one-shot-only until you can re-freeze it."
2,Loose Dasher,Inside dasher mixer fits too loose does not scrape ice cream or sorbet off the sides imposible to remove after the product is frozen.
5,Yum Yum in your Tum Tum,"This product is great. I was a little nervous about ordering a factory refurb, but after reading the reviews on others who have gone the way of purchasing the refurbs I went for it. I am so glad I did. The machine was shipped and packaged beautifully, no way to tell this item from a brand new one. It works great, and my kids and I love making ice cream. One thing, be sure to follow the recipe for volume, or you will have some of the mix creeping out of the top. But it is an easy clean-up. Keep your bowl in the freezer and you can whip up some ice cream at any time."
4,Great little machine,"Well worth the $20 I got it on sale for. Makes delicious homemade icecream, slushies, sorbet, etc."
5,Love It!,"This makes the best ice cream I have ever had! You can't even tell that it is reconditioned. I highly recommend this product for anyone who likes ice cream. I noticed that some people complained about it being loud, but it isn't any louder than a dishwasher. It is definitely more quiet than some of the ice cream makers I have heard. I think you would be very happy with this item....I AM!!"
4,Ice Cream--Here I come,"The first day I had it, I made some pistachio gelato....Wow, what a surprise! Really easy and fast!! I especially like the size of it...less counter space and just right for 2-3 people with a bit left over. I have tried 4 different flavors and all were great!! You really ought to try it...and reconditioned is just a word. Its looks and runs as new!"
5,perfect,This works great. It's a bit small so I purchased the larger version also. Sometimes I use them both at the same time if I am making a lot.
3,Guessing it would be a good product!,"Its hard to rate this item since it didn't work!! However, Tiger Direct was great in handling the return. Thanks."
2,Cuisinart ICE-21 Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker--broke third time used,I see that the Model 20 is no longer advertised. My experience with it is:Used it 3 times. Worked fine.Fourth time----- VERY noisy. But that isn't my problem with it. After the ice cream was made (looked fine) I (and a strong man) could not 'unlatch' the top! And we tried everything except a hammer.I would love to know if anyone else had that problem.
5,I LOVE THIS!,"I recently purchased this ice cream maker. I love it. My 4 1/2 year old son made strawberry yogurt last night. It's so easy. Just freeze the canister, dump in the ingredients, turn it on, and get ready! The instruction book is helpul with lots of basic recipes. When we made our ice cream or yogurt, we really don't measure everything that goes in there - Just pour it in. My kids love and I know it's healthy for them. You can substitute lower fat ingredients and it doesn't effect the end result. A must buy!"
4,Great for cool treats,"Bought this from a warehouse club a few years ago, came with an extra bowl. An extra bowl is a nice feature as we have a lot of nearby relatives and it's nice to make more than 1 1/2 qts of ice cream at a time for a get together.Fairly easy to use, freeze the bowl, place on base, add paddle and cover, add in ingredients, turn on and come back about 20 minutes later.Makes good, fresh ice cream. Ours had a recipe book, one of our favorites is making chocolate ice cream but you add in a package of instant chocolat pudding, anyone for a bowl full of pudding pops? You can add mix ins like nuts candy, etc. Just make sure they are in small pieces.Only drawbacks, gets a little noisy, and the opening where you add your ingredients could be a little better designed, either offset a little or have a chute to add stuff in."
5,Wonderful Ice Cream,"I bought this item so I could make sugar-free ice cream. It does a wonderful job, turning out a tasty treat in about 20 minutes. You can't beat that!Clean up is a snap. The stirrer just rests inside the bowl, so there's no difficulty in washing up afterward. The machine looked brand new and works great. No complaints here!"
1,Ice Cream???,"More like frappe. I have attempted ice cream twice. The first time I thought maybe the bucket wasnt frozen solid, so I cranked my freezer up on high and left in there for 24 hours. BOTH times the ingredients came out thin and soupy. I even tried running the machine longer, to no avail. The only way to get anywhere near ice cream consistency was to just freeze the ingredients and keep stirring every 1/2 hour or so. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of an Ice Cream MAKER??? Thumbs down from me on this product, and I will probably rummage up the receipt and return it."
5,Great Little Icecream Maker,We have enjoyed this little ice cream maker for about 1 month now. I was a little hesitant to buy a refurbished one but the price (24.99) was too good to pass up. It has been working flawlessly. My family loves the ice cream it makes. We are very happy with this purchase.
4,Just Like New,"I was thinking about making ice cream at home but I didn't want to invest a lot of money in something that I thought might be just a passing fancy. This product was the perfect match for me. I have made several great (and a couple of not so great) batches of ice cream. The key to the success of this product is making sure that the mixing bucket is frozen SOLID! Solid means frozen at zero degrees. Like most things, the bucket will freeze below 32 degrees, but it will not be solid enough to make a quality product. I have also found it helpful if the mix is good and cold at the time its poured into the ice cream maker. Anyone that is concerned about the ice cream maker being reconditioned, I couldn't tell, it looks brand new. I gave this item four stars instead of five because, like some of the other reviewers stated, it is a bit loud, although not awful. I will be hard pressed to go back to store bought ice cream!"
5,A Must-Have,"If you love ice cream, this appliance will quickly become a must-have in your kitchen. Long after I put away the cumbersome breadmaker, the citrus squeezer and the toaster oven, my Cuisinart still gets its place on my kitchen counter. We have not been without homemade ice cream since the day this arrived. It's foolproof. Mine has been working without a glitch for over a year. You'll love it."
4,Cuisinart 1.5 qt ice cream maker,I really like my new ice cream maker. It works really well. It makes just enough and it freezes quickly. I only had one batch that did not freeze well; I attributed this to possibly having too much in the tub. It was a runny ice cream so I popped it into the freezer for a while and it finished freezing to the desired consistency. I highly recommend this product for 2-4 people to have ice cream!
5,Good buy,"Never used an ice cream maker before, but I found out it's quite easy to do so. My roommate said it's much quieter than his mom's ice cream maker, and thus far everyone has liked the ice cream I've made with it."
2,Only worked for a short time!,"I bought this new, and it worked great, UNTIL I made the mistake of taking the freezing bowl out of the freezer, to thaw out, and stored it for 1 week. When I refroze it a week later, it never made ice cream again, no matter how cold the freezer was or how long I kept it in there. I suspect that once you freeze it and keep it in the freezer, you MUST keep it in there from then on and NEVER thaw it out. I returned mine, but I will never buy this type of ice cream maker again for fear that it won't work."
3,I imagine this is ok,"but I don't know for sure, because I've never actually used it. It just sits in my freezer, mocking me, saying ""when are you going to make ice cream?""The answer: I do not know."
2,Slip - Sliding Away,"This 1987 Chet Atkin's album finds him slip-sliding away. Please don't get me wrong. Believe me. when I was in the 8th grade, I got into fistfights defending Chet Atkin's unheralded mastery of the guitar. Of course, back then, in the 1950's I had his ""Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions"" on the RCA label to prove it. Now while Chet wasn't the reason I bought my first electric guitar (that was becaues of Buddy Holly), Chet Atkins and His Guitar were synonymous with excellence in the rough - the rough being country. Country was at the root of his fresh approach to the other guitar genres - folk, classical, Latin, etc. In retrospect there were about 8 seminal albums like ""Dimensions"" that Chet cut for RCA Victor. I'm not going to name them off because guitar aficianados are already well aware of them.(They're all out on CD by the way.)Sails is not seminal. It's down right weak."
5,Where do I get the next cassette??,"I have ordered, read, and studied RAD for 2 years, after having a daughter, adopted from Russia at age 14 who has this. This author made cassettes that were easy to listen to, funny and lighthearted at times, yet very informative. My husband, who will read nothing, even listened to them. I didn't have to nag, either! He want's to know what the dad is supposed to do with these children... the tape focuses on the mom. To follow her advice, you could not be a working mom, however. We are ready for tapes #3 and #4!"
3,A DANISH FILM WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL DONE IN 2005.,"DEFINITELY a Scandinavian (BROODING) film. The acting is good, but the movie just is not anything special. I would not recommend it. I don't think this one is better or worse than the American version done in 2010."
2,Mis-represented,"The ""Title"" of this item indicates it comes with 2 K Type thermocouple probes. In the manufacturers description it infers the probes range is to 1832 F. ""The truth is it comes with 1 type K probe only usable to 482 F"". The other mis-representation is that it comes with a protective Holster. The truth is it comes with an orange protective rubber over cover.I would like to see these inaccuracies corrected on the Amazon web site but cannot see a way to contact them."
5,LOVELY SET OF DISHES,I JUST LOVE THESE DISHES - I PARTICULARLY WANTED A SIMPLE SET WITH DELICATE CUPS WITH HANDLES - THIS FIT THE BILL AND WAS MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE DEPARTMENT STORES - I DID BREAK A CUP ALMOST RIGHT AWAY BUT REPLACED IT FROM EBAY
2,IckIckIck but there may still be hope . . .,"Was anyone else disgusted by the whole Meren-Anath thing? I don't want to seem like a prude and I am glad that it appears as if Meren's finally getting over his wife's death, but geez. It's a tribute to the writer that she has the skill to make a reader cringe with the charachter's humiliation, but still. Ouch. And I was hit by how surreal the party to catch the killer was. It was more Murder, She Wrote than a sensible action by charachters I feel I know. I commend readers who slogged their way through the whole thing - I was forced to skim sections of it. ...As much as I didn't like this one, the suggestion of the real murderer at the end was intriguing and would make a good sub-plot for a sequel. ..."
3,The good and the bad,"I was so excited to get this book for Christmas but was completely discouraged to see there is no yardage requirement for any of the patterns. Someone posted that any yarn shop could help with that. I'm not so sure. I think it would be educated guess work on either their part or mine.As someone else stated, I'm not sure about the sizing either. Kitty is a wisp of a woman and if she's a size 34, I'm not so sure I'm a 36. I think any woman over 5'6"" and 150 pounds may not even fit in the largest size Kitty shows. And if you want the sweater larger to be less-fitted, you may be in trouble too. But I'm guessing.That said, it's a beautiful book. The patterns are lovely and Kitty is an inspiration. The book is one of 3 books that I own that has numerous patterns I would use."
1,"Eye Candy Only, NO Charts, NO yardage, No graphs","I am so disapointed in this book when it came in the mail. This book is strictly eye candy. There is no functional good way to come up with yardage, and she supplies absolutely none. There are no charts, No graphs for assistance, unless you are an expert knitter, and even then you are left guessing. How can you name a book ""Designer Knitting"" when when there are no designs or graphs? I would not recommend this book, period."
3,Caveat Emptor,"This is a beautifully laid out book, and I loved Kitty's chioces of yarn combinations. However,I was quite surprised and disappointed to see that no yardage requirements were given. This is the first knitting book that I have purchased that omits these, and I own over a hundred of them."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed by this book. I was looking for inspiration and here is a book filled with the same basic sweater over and over again. Cropped silhouette, chunky yarns. A couple of other styles but very, very basic. I interpreted the title to mean sweaters designed by Fashion designers, but the ""designer"" in question is the author, an interior decorator. I will shop more carefully next time.The other problem was what some other reviewers have mentioned: the lack of yarn quantity/yardage. For those of us without a neighborhood yarn shop, and who rely on online yarn shopping, we are left to guess how much yarn to purchase."
3,"NO Yardage, NO Kidding",Saw this book in Barnes and Noble and ordered it from you but I evidently did not look at it closely enough. I am an experienced knitter but not one that can figure out yardage probably because I have never had to do it. My local knit shop could possibly help but I would much rather the amounts were listed in the pattern. Also Kitty looks like she is a size 4 and is used to designing sweaters for herself but come on give the rest of us a break. I am a size 8-10 but since these designs are made to fit exactly to buy expensive yarn combos and not know how much to buy is asking for trouble and a waste of good money.
1,You figure it out!,"Kitty Bartholomew's, ""Designer Knitting,"" has wonderful pictures thatclearly allow you to appreciate the completed design. What is appallingis that Bartholomew does not indicate the amount of yarn required for any of the many sweater options given. In addition, most of the patterns have a guage of 2.5-3 stitches with the yarn doubled. Completely frustrating! Bartholomew admits she isn't sure about the yarn because much of it was bought in the United States or abroad. Although the designs and use of color are pleasing - I think presenting a pattern book without giving a clue as to how to figure out how much yarn you need is irresponsible. This is the worse pattern book I have every purchased. In addition, she suggests finding someone and paying to have the sweater finished b/c she doesn't like sewing the seams.E. LeFebvre"
5,This will become a classic to own.,"Kitty Bartholomew has put together a lovely collection of sweaters that will inspire just about everyone to want to knit at least one. Her designs are classic, guaranteed to work for every figure and every age group. I especially love her discussion of the type of yarns to consider and her encouragement that you can knit something that fits! I plan on knitting several of her designs, and can hardly wait to take her book with me to my local yarn shop and get started. I have purchased several pattern books recently, and this is one I keep coming back to again and again for inspiration."
4,One of the best unsigned bands I have ever seen. The CD rulz,Get this CD. They are going to be a band to be remembered
5,Las Vegas Music Scene,"An excellent recording by a talented band. Definetely check out their self-titled site. ""Leap of Faith"" and ""September"" stand out especially. Next to the unrivaled sound of ""12 Volt Sex"" ...), another local Vegas band, they are the best unsigned group in the valley. Rock on."
5,A superb album....,"This is such a classic for Baez fans, I'm just disappointed that they haven't put it out on CD or Mp3 downloaad!"
1,the author made an easy buck on this one,"As a fan, you don't need this book. The pictures lack quality, the stories don't feature any news. If you buy one of the authentic biographies or the official DVD you'll enjoy it a lot more."
4,Good biography of Little Mac,"This book is part of the ""Canadian Lives"" series published by Oxford University Press, which, while a suitable biography for anyone wishing to learn more about William Lyon MacKenzie, seems to be geared towards high school students. As MacKenzie is most famous for his political agitations and leading role in the 1837 rebellion in Upper Canada, much of the book deals with his life leading up to the latter event. The author draws on a number of contemporary sources--including MacKenzie's own writings--and quotes from them regularly. Also included are a number of illustrations of key persons, places, and events, as well as several facsimiles, including that of MacKenzie's ""Independence!"" handbill. Overall, a good biography."
2,Some Good Information,As a llama owner that is always looking for more information I found the first half of this book to be very interesting. However the last protion of the book got into a lot of personal beliefs of the author and was a complete waste of time. I could care less about her belief in psychics as well as her dreams. There are a lot better books on llamas I would suggest you save your money and shop for other books.
1,"Terrible toy, great idea, needs reworked","This thing is a great idea but wasn't engineered well at all. We had this about 2 days before it completely fell apart, the computer wouldn't work at all, and it just failed miserably. We're not hard on toys at all and this just didn't make sense. Took it back and got my money back on this one - don't even bother. Wait until something else comes out because you're sure to have to return it. Big, big thumbs down - very upsetting to a young child to have to have this happen. Plus, the little computer is VERY hard to see and make out. Just a very poor design."
5,DETROIT IS MY HOME WHERE JAZZ IS AT HOME.,I have been listen to jazz for about 40yrs. Ray Brown is the number one bassit in the world.He has played with so many players that love his bass playing ability.Ray Brown is the finest Bassit in the WORLD.From A DETROITER!
5,The last Stitch,"This is a excellent book of Dr Crosthwait's life and Medical profession in the early 1900's. I purchased it for my children, whom he is related to. It's a rare find.I searched for it for several years."
4,An amazing life told by an amazing man,"You can't help admire Zig, he says what he believes. His life story really gives you an insite into his amazing ability to lift and motivate people. He came from nothing to become the king of motivation and sales training"
5,EWF's MOST UNDERRATED ALBUM - A MASTERPIECE,"No EWF collection would be complete without ""Touch The World."" Often Described as a ""comeback"" album it is nothing of the sort. This work shows the true genius and mastery of music and lyrics that made EWF legendary from the funky, danceable and yes, politically relevant ""System of Survival""to the hopelessly romantic ""Every Now And Then"" you will find something to love on each track of this wonderful album. So do not believe the rumors that this is some kind of ""sub-EWF work."" It is big, bad, bold and able to stand up to the best of the band's work."
4,touch the world,"Touch the world. Maurice & the boyz definitely put it down on this one. Not celebrated as previous releases however,this production imparta EWF capability to stay in stride with the times. System of Survival & Thinking of You, fortifies the standard we've come to expect from EWF. The remaining tracks provide a smooth variety that should nuture the musical appetite of any EWF enthusiast. This is one you must have in your EWF collection."
5,It's all there and it's damn good,"With the noted exception of U.F.Orb, their albums can be a bit choppy. Running from the brilliant to the self-indulgent. This distills almost all of the best tracks they have ever done. For fans and new comers alike, this disc is great. If your a real Orb collector, you won't find any obscure mixes here, mostly 7"" edits of the hits. Even on the Volkswagon commercial, Little Fluffly Clouds is one of the most amazing tracks ever. Excellent and well worth buying."
3,Uninspired Selection,"As mentioned elsewhere, the choice of tracks range from the obvious releases (Little Fluffy Clouds, Blue Room) to noisy crap that was never released (Mickey Mars). The version of 'Towers of Dub' is noodly and boring, and tracks like PI and DJ Asylem can hardly be called 'The best of the Orb' really now, can they? I bought the one CD version of this album, and you can buy a limited edition two CD version. The tracks on CD 2 are practically the same ones as on CD 1 in different remixed forms! Where's the logic in that when there are so many classic tracks on the first two albums alone that surely belong here (the track U.F.Orb itself for instance). Anyway, buy Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld & U.F.Orb instead as everyone knows the rest of their output was dismal (Pomme Fritz, Orbus Terraneous and Orblivion were all dire, dire wastes of money)."
1,Do NOT get this CD!,"If you like boring repitive songs this CD is for you.There is only one good song on this CD and even it's not great. Do not wast your money with Orb, go get a Underworld or Fluke CD insted."
3,Good Nuts Poor Packing,Always looking for a good deal on Planters Dry Roasted Unsalted peanuts and this is a good deal. However Amazon still has packing problems and two of the jars were broken on receipt. Kept the shipment as it was still not a bad price but Amazon needs to QC the packing more carefully. I will buy them again.
3,"Good Resource, not perfect","Well, it really isn't really as bad as the previous reviewer claimed. Mine did come with a CD, but because of the cheesy synth backing, I couldn't even listen to it without cringing.If you have an audio of the song, or hear it in session, this book makes a nice ""fill in the gaps."" Irish music really is an aural tradition, and no music book will cover all the bases. That being said, many of us like a reference to ""the dots"" from time to time.If you play harmonica in session, this book is helpful. Remember that nearly everything in the book has been translated to the key of C, regardless of the original setting. If you've learned to read music with a C harmonica, as I did, this makes it pretty easy. Just play it the same way with the D or G harp as needed, and you're set."
5,Romantic,This is one of the first romantic movies I can remember watching as a teenager and I loved it. I ordered it on DVD recently and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then.
4,Only one of it's kind.,This is undoubtedly one of the most amazing stories filmed. What a plot of sacrifice and devotion! The acting is Old-Hollywood-Great...dramatic and affecting.
4,Magnificent Obsession,"Good movie, color could be better, even though it is from overseas, not bad. one of my favorite moving and inspirational movies.Thanks"
5,Great film,This has been one of my favorite movies for years and I have been hunting a DVD copy of it for several years now. So this was a find! It's an excellent old black and white movie that is a joy to watch. The entire cast does an outstanding job.
5,A page turner.,I never thought a Lyndon Johnson could be so engrossing. After reading the glowing reviews of the recently released fourth volume I decided to read the series. Robert Caro is just a plain amazing writer. This first volume is a masterpiece. I can't wait for my reading time now.
3,"""A long Path""",It is too long and there are too many repetetions. But this is interesting stuff which is recommended to all students of the political system in USA.
3,A thoroughly enjoyable screed,"I started The Path to Power knowing essentially nothing about Lyndon Johnson. From the first pages, however, I was laughing out loud at Caro's over-the-top hatred of his subject. In Caro's telling, everything Johnson does to benefit anyone is really for his own advancement, he's the sole cause of all that's bad, and he corrupts everyone who comes into contact with him. On the other hand, everyone he works against is brilliant or good-hearted, if not both.Nonetheless, by dispensing with subtlety and sympathy Caro has made this an enthralling work."
2,Caro despises Johnson,"I am about 200 pages into this book, and I am not sure I can finish it.According to Caro Lyndon Johnson was the most despicable person on earth. I don't know, maybe he was, but Caro cannot find one thing good to say about him. There is no evidence of any balance in this bio, it gets a little tiring of reading nothing but how awful a person Johnson was. Apparently Johnson never told the truth to anyone at any time.I love reading biographies, but this one has been a disappointment so far."
3,Lots of interesting facts,This book has lots of interesting facts about the life of Lyndon Johnson and his determined rise to become President of the United States.
4,A great expose',"Caro does a great job of showing this POTUS' ego and severe delusional mental disorders. As a combat infantryman I was not yet old enough to vote but old enough to die for LBJ's un-Constitutional war. LBJ was just as evil as Lincoln, Wilson, and FDR. All of the aforementioned got America involved in wars that were none of our business. If you have never served in combat then you need to digest my words.Young men I had come to know became severely maimed or killed to feed this sorry individuals ego. I know, we were sent there to STOP the spread of Communism. Tell me what rule of government has been in place for the last 37 years in Viet Nam. The evil that Caro points out about this demon ( LBJ ) does not even begin to touch the surface."
5,The Path to Power: the years of Lyndon Johnson I: 1,"This is an extraordinary book. The information is highly detailed, but the details are necessary for conveying the story of this very, very strange man . Not only do we learn about his personal life, but about America and especially the Texas of his day. Everything that I have been reading is new for me. I can hardly wait to see in future volumes how the young Lyndon, a generally repulsive person, could evolve to the point that he was responsible for the civil rights legislation and Medicare for which I remember him. I think that Robert Caro is remarkable."
1,Unbelivable Nonsense,"Anyone who justifies the mutilation of bodies, the wearing of women's body parts as hat ornaments, the smashing of children's heads as they beg for their lives, is a very sick person. People who would justify this would justify the holocaust."
4,A Young Girls phase to Womanhood,"Ever since she was a teenager, she has dazzled audiences. Her pleasant voice and talent has made her career trancend throughout the years. One of the hardest things for a young girl is to make the change to womanhood. Karina has sucessfully done it in this CD. The songs are for a maturer audience and the lyrics portray the essence of her voice. I trully recommend this CD for people who enjoy pop-music."
3,Perfectly Decent Pop (And What In The World Is Wrong With Perfectly Decent Pop?),"Pop Kulcher Review: The third album from San Jose, California's effervescent sunshine pop band the Orange Peels, Circling The Sun, sounds... well, a whole lot like the first two. Chiming, featherweight guitar pop, evoking the late 60's sounds of Bacharach, the Free Design, and the Mamas & the Papas, filtered through the retro pop stylings of the Apples in Stereo. A bit of the charm is gone by now, though it's replaced by a more polished, denser sound that keeps things (slightly) more interesting. Not memorable by a long shot, but for those happy summer days, the Orange Peels are the sort of band that's nice to have around."
4,prettttty killer,"This book was awesome in the way that it portrayed all of peter parker's hardships and what not; as others said. There was great action and peril, but the end was a little too ""lasy episode of friends"" for my taste. Also, the plot developement was a little off, and it seemed like a couple things weren't where they where supposed to be. Lastly, I wanted to see Doc Oc as more of a calculating, cut-throat, villian, than another disturbed one; ala, the comics. All in all it was a great read, and I really recomend reading it,and I can't wait to see the flick."
5,"Spider-Man, Spider-Man...","I read this book cover to cover in two hours, and when it was over, I screamed into the air, ""HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL THIS MOVIE OPENS?""By the end of this book, you will feel Peter Parker's pain as tries to keep his life from spinning out of control. Peter David spins a web of a story that will hold you in its grasp and will not let you go, even on the last page. If the movie is half as good as the book, it will rock so hard. Buy this book. You won't regret it."
5,Spider-man still flying high...,"This book was great. I love Peter David's brand of humor and the little touches he adds to the screenplay. The story itself is very deep as it's more about characterization than the first book. This book may not be as ""action-oriented"" but I'm not reading this for the action (I'm watching the movie for that!) and it was fun reading about Peter, MJ, and Doc Ock. Check it out."
4,Nice expansion of the movie,"The book starts with several chapters of background on Peter Parker and Doc Ock. All this is very interesting, though not entirely needed, but it's good to have in nonetheless as it offers a good introduction to the characters.David's writing style is fairly exciting and easy to read, as he has had a lot of practice with superhero novelizations (Batman, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Fantastic Four, you name it). He added in a mental conversation between Ock and his tentacles which I thought was an interesting, though maybe not especially gripping, approach to explaining their relationship.The script this is based on is well crafted and has excitement, although it is not as deep or philosophical as you could expect from say, Batman Begins.The action scenes in the book are played down a little, which was slightly disappointing.Overall, the book is a good adaption of the film and, especially if you are a Spidey fan or want some background info, it's worth at least a read."
4,Sequel of adventures of the web-head,The second part of the Spiderman trilogy introduces a refined Doc Ock. Storyline is action packed and entertaining. Thankfully there is more MJ!! Peter David lives up to his reputation with another well written Spider story.
1,Hurts my ear,The very hard plastic does not fit well on my ear. It really hurts the top of my ear and seems to pull my ear out a little. Very uncomfortable. Am throwing it out and getting a headset that goes over the head instead.
3,Panasonic KX-TCA93 Headset,"Low price, sounds good but not a comfortable fit. The headset just dangles off the earlope and does not feel secure."
5,Highly Recommend!,This is my 2nd or 3rd of these headphones. They last forever. They're well made and the sound is clear. Highly recommend!
5,Great Product,Sound is very good. The volume control makes it personalized for each call and the style doesn't mess up my hair.
2,You get what you pay for,"As the old adage goes... ""You get what you pay for"". I paid cheap. I got cheap. This headset is poorly made. Sound reception is weak, though the party you are speaking to can hear you well enough (and everyone else in the room with you). This headset is certainly NOT good enough for an office environment. At home where it is quiet...... Maybe (Maybe not). I do not recommend them."
1,Panasonic KX - TCA93,"Microphone doesnt work properly and customer have hard time hearing me, i dont recommend this product, i dont recommend this product."
2,Too quiet,"This is hard to place over the ear. It's also difficult to hear the caller even with volume maxed on phone and headset. I haven't heard anyone complain about hearing me, however."
1,DIsappointed,"As I usually talk while I cook, I have always used an ear piece. However, I was very disappointed with the panasonic KX-TCA93 headset I purchased for my new uniden phone. It does not fit comfortably over my ear and the volume is very low unless I press the headset close to my ear. I really miss ""chatting"" while I cook!"
2,Panasonic KX TCA93 - Headset ( clip-on ),Hard to keep on your ear and then adjust mouthpiece. Not very loud even with volume turned all the way up. Caller on other end detects a funny background noise.
4,"Great Sound, awesome volume contro.","I am using this headset with the Panasonic phone model KX-TGA931T, which is an otherwise great phone, except the volume remains rather high even at the lowest setting when when used pressed against the ear. With this headset, I have better control of the sound, even down to mute using the inline volume control. The only thing that I do not like about it is that it feels tight when pressed against my ear."
1,Poopy,Do not waste your money. I bought this to use at the office with a Panasonic cordless phone and the sound quality is junk. People at the other end of the line can barely hear me and they complain about strange noises.
1,Panasonic head set,"I bought this unit in order to be able to make hands free phone calls for service calls to automatic answering machines: the type where you have to go through six layers of answers before you can choose a live person to talk to. However, the part that holds the receiver to your ear does not fit either my or my wifes ear so I will sent it back."
1,Terrible design - useless at any price,"It doesn't matter how inexpensive this headset is - it's useless at any price. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The ear loop has no adjustment, can't be flexed and is actually painful to put around your ear. I don't know how anyone could wear it. The mute button is exactly that - a momentary contact button. You have to hold it to stay muted! (see my picture). I don't know how it sounds because there was no point trying it on a call. It's going back..."
3,"Blah, blah, blah","Lots of blood and hits, lots of fimiiliar faces mainly actors that appear in a lot of mob type movies. The plot did take the mob into the computer world we live on today and was smart in getting right in at the beginning because if it was NOT at the beginning it would never work. The subplots were hard to follow for me. The total overall story was weak and I probably will not watch this one again but it DID kill a boreing saturday afternoon for me. I spent 10 bucks for an afternoon of entertainment so I am not really pissed or disappointed. Bottom line is if you like mob movies, have 10 bucks to throw away and a couple hours to kill it is an OK buy....."
5,This Thing of Ours...,If your into Mafia flicks you'll like this one.Frank Vincent is my favorite...I rate this dvd a 5 of 5 stars!!
1,This Thing Is A Joke,"Recognizable actors from Goodfellas, Casino, The Sopranos and a few other Mob movies get together in this sad, sad attempt at making a film."
1,Worst mafia movie ever made!,"This is by far the worst mafia movie ever made! Self-indulgent, an awful plot and an absolute waste of time and money. Any of the reviewers who gave this a good review have obviously no idea what makes a good mafia movie. lMy friends watched this and felt the same way. What was James Caan thinking. While the actors (most of them) I like from other films and t.v. shows including ""The Sopranos"", they must have been temporarily crazy when they appeared in this drivel. Frank Vincent especially is a big disappointment both as an executive producer and as an actor. He normally is very good in films and was great in ""The Sopranos"" as was Vincent Pastore."
1,worst movie ever,"This is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.What a bunch of wanna be's .This movie is full of no talent,no plot,nothing worth your time or money.what a waste.what a joke!"
1,0 stars wasn't an option so I had to give it one star,This movie sucked major @**! I hated it. It's the worst mob movie EVER!!! Don't waste your hard earned dollars buying this film.
5,Great for all,"I don't listen to much rap, because not all of it is that great, but Tical 2000 is the best I have heard in a long time. Method Man doesn't over do it and doesn't under do it. He mixes it up for people of all ages. Method Man really got it going, especially with Perfect World."
4,"Bye, Bye Miss American Pie","Fascinating telling of the air crash deaths of well known rock stars and musicians. It starts with the most well known crash, ""the night the music died"" and recounts the stories behind the deaths of Patsy Cline, Otis Redding, Rick Nelson and many others. A good read for any rock & roll, history, or trivia buff."
2,Slightly Enlightening,"I was disappointed in the lack of content in this book. While I was slightly enlightened with what appear to be some interesting facts, I believe there could have been much more information, resulting in a much thicker book. I finished this in two quick sittings (about a 3.5 hour read). This was a rush job, without a lot of commitment to research. The last few artists barely get a mention. Randy Rhodes, the guitarist that resurrected Ozzy Ozborne's career gets 1.5 pages??"
5,Everitt Rock and Roll Heaven Review,"I loved getting the real story from a news anchor. The fact that the author was reporting the inaccuracy of first reports made the material especially interesting. I would highly recommend the book to any rock/country fan, especially those who find facts about their favorite performers of interest. I am purchasing for Christmas presents."
3,interesting subject,"I thought this book was interesting and it helped to answer some questions. The book could have been longer and it did seem like a fast creation by the author. Also the author did not need to provide information regarding the extent of the injuries that were suffered by its music stars. Common sense will tell you that the injuries of any passenger in a light weight aircraft crash can be horrific. With all of that said, I would still give this book a good rating.Anyone interested in this topic would certainly find this book interesting.Music's Broken Wings by Heitman also covers this topic. The Ricky Nelson crash is covered in great detail. That book is larger and does a better job of sparing the reader from the upsetting information.Both are interesting reading material."
5,Color A Love - Song of the Year,"Take my advice- buy this cd. Color A Love is the best song this reviewer has heard in a long time. Lauren Hart's vocal on this catchy melody will stick in your mind for days. The rhythm is cool, the lyrics first rate, and oh yeh, she's pretty too! Buy this cd."
1,The worst book I have ever read.,"This book promises documented sightings, photographic proof, conspiracy theories and more. What it provides is a couple of pages of well-known curiosities (misspelling on his gravestone, for example) but no reasoned explanation of anything at all. The vast majority of the book is comprised of short stories of accounts of meeting the King all given by people whose identities are kept secret. The standard line is "" I can never prove it, but I know He is with us still"". My favourite account is of a guy who lives in a trailer park who is obsessed with Elvis, sees the back of someone walking past his window the morning after a night of heavy drinking, and falls down and cuts himself running out to try and see the person's face. He KNOWS he has seen Elvis....because he has the scar to prove it. If you are considering buying this book, poke out both your eyes with a pencil. In the long run, you will come to realise you made the right decision."
3,Nice tin - shoddy contents,"The tin is great for holding the pieces, but the pieces are not cut to match each other. It was disappointing to open the tin and find that it was the best part of the purchase."
1,"Nice Tin, Spend 5 bucks more for the real deal","My girlfriend brought this game home from walmart the other day, I used to play ""jenga"" when I was a kid and always liked it... Well let me tell you this ""jumbling tower"" is just a piece crap. The reasons why have already been brought up. First and foremost is the size of the blocks. I'm sure that Jenga is patented and thats why this chinese knockoff uses blocks that are not the right size. According to the instructions you are supposed to rebuild the tower by hand, equally spacing every other row of blocks so that it creates a layer equal size of the last. I dont know about you but i dont want to spend 10 minutes to rebuild this tower. With jenga you just plop the blocks down in the little holder and stand it up with minimal fuss.The storage tin in a nice touch vs a cardboard box but believe me that is the only thing this has going for it."
3,"Love the idea, wish it was easier!",I owned one of the original Epilady's when they first came out 18-19 years ago. It worked great for keeping my legs smooth and eliminating my need for shaving for about a week. This one performs equally well although it is designed differently. I cannot say whether the newer one is less painful than the old because both are uncomfortable. I was hoping for a miraculous method to eliminate my need to shave. I barely tolerated 10-15 minutes per day of use and only was able to do up to my knees. I am going to try again once shorts season rolls around again...I really hate to shave. I recommend this item if you have a high pain tolerance.
5,THE MIDNIGHT BRIDE - great!,"Ms. Carroll has written a wonderful sequel to THE BRIDE FINDER and THE NIGHT DRIFTER. Val St. Leger is a doctor who has the ability to absorb his patient's pain. He has been told by the Bride Finder that he will never have a bride. However, Val is feeling the St. Leger ""need to wed"" and wants Kate Fitzleger who is the adopted daughter of the Bride Finder. Kate wants Val, even if it means going against the tradition of the Bride Finder and its potential for tragedy. A shard of magic crystal and the return of a family enemy begins this interesting and exciting novel. As an avid reader, I constantly weigh the price against how badly (and how quickly) I want to read the novel. I wanted this one and paid the hard-back price. It was money well spent."
4,Enchanting but predictable,"Dr. Valentine St Leger practices medicine. As a St Leger, he has the touch, the legacy of his cursed ancestor Prospero. Kate, his dear friend and the adopted daughter of a distant relative, is the joy as well as the bain of his existence. She meddles in his life the way she does on others--a charm here and a spell there. Their lives are changed when the last of the Mortmains, Rafe, returns to fulfill his destiny before he dies. It's such a pleasure to read a well written book with all the elements that make it a grand read.. My regret is that three isn't the charm. Well written, well plotted, great characters and all, I found this tale a bit predictable."
3,Refreshing,"In the beginning, the hero was a bit too helpless to suit me. Later on, when he was angry about all the things happening to him - how everyone expected him to help everyone, how he would never have a family and would just have to deal with it, how he would have to help his brother's wife in childbirth, how it was logical if he sacrificed himself and everyone took it for granted - it made me think he had a really miserable life and really needed some changes. OK, not so drastic changes as that what happened, but he simply couldn't go on like that. The magic in the story added some excitement and some sparks, but in the end, I wished they would spend some more time together when he was his normal self, not self-pitying or crazy-exuberant. The heroine, however, was great, loving, caring, a bit reckless, I loved her. And the addition of the family ghost didn't hurt, either. All in all, not a bad book for a lazy afternoon."
4,Pure Escapism,Susan Carroll tells enthralling stories that are sure to entertain even those who say they don't like romance novels. What I enjoy is the way she weaves the paranormal into her stories and I can escape into a dream world for a little while.
4,Good Book on Spiritual Warfare,"I've read several books on spiritual warfare lately, and found that from a practical point of view, who better to tell us about warfare than a modern-day warrior? Although I prefer Kay Arthur's book on warfare because it made me dig more deeply in the Scriptures and make conclusions for myself, I still think Mr. Weber's book gave better insight from the point of view of someone who had actually been in a war. I would recommend reading both books to give a balanced view on this subject, spiritual and practical."
1,Item never shipped,This item was never shipped. The company stated that it had been shipped but never did ship the item.
5,seler alameda did a good job,"The seller Alameda shipped the peoduct very fast and it was very clean. Unfortunately the product was not what I expected nor what I wanted and it was due to an error, glitch or oversight, etc on the part of the Amazon advertisement that was presented. It was a misrepresentation that I hope never happens again."
5,Cute shoe!,Have gotten tons of compliments on this shoe. Very comfortable not to mention cute. Bought 1/2 size up......usually wear a 7.5 but the 8 felt more comfortable.
2,"Miles, distorted in mono...again","This is a very simple, but straight forward review. All tracks are in MONO. However, that's not the main problem with this CD. Tracks 3 (Teo) and 4 (Walkin') are very distorted during Mile's heavy solos. This is truly a historic recording, but don't waste your money. I paid $0.98 cents for it used and that was too much. I don't want to waste anymore of your time reviewing this CD...just don't buy it, take it from an avid Miles Davis collector."
5,"Great photos, how-tos and patterns","If you are looking for a good reference for techniques and also for some great patterns for borders, this is the book for you. Also, if you want to make that great Windmill Log Cabin as shown on the opening of Simply Quilts, Bonnie has included all of the instructions to make this quilt. I liked the border patterns especially ... some of them are borders from prizewinning quilters like Linda Roy's Best of Show quilt, Spice of Life, and Gladi Porsche's beautiful appliqued border in Keeping Autumn with Me. Bonnie has designed some new borders too. I'm glad to have it in my library."
1,It is not noodles but noodle scraps,"I usually don't write reviews but compelled to do so because1. This is not chow mein noodles. My order has 12 packs and all of them are small bits instead of lengthy noodles like how chow mein noodles is supposed to be. This is like someone bought scrap noodle leftovers that are broken and made an item out of it.2. When I tried to return it says this item is not eligible for returns. I thought all items bought from amazon are returnable, well, I learned my lesson the hard way.Stay away from this brand !!"
5,"Very funny, as usual","Of course you know Lucille Ball would never let you down. This video is hilarious, with Lucy getting into all sorts of trouble, and meeting Ricky. I'd recommend this to anyone."
4,Wolfe and Gaiman!,"This is a campy fictionalization of a walking tour guide of the shambles, a neighborhood in Chicago. In it there are a number of humorous horror elements detailing the various locales and some of the denizens of the area. One of my favorites was the Rent a Rifle at the top of the largest building where you would attempt to shoot sight seers of the sears building. Overall, I would probably say that this is one that most people could skip... but as it was written by two of my favorite authors it has been on my to read list for quite some time."
2,"If you like Edward Gorey's work, get it. If not, don't.","This book reads like a whimsical guidebook (and is less than a centimeter thick), has playfully macabre art, and all the substance of a marshmallow. If you can't get enough of amusing depictions of dessicating and dying children, shrines to Cthonic gods, and lurking horrors, this might be for you. If you're looking for something mildly engrossing with actual content, keep looking."
5,Excellent; Fun and A Great Scare,"This is just a good old-fashioned scare; the review that leaves me almost speechless is the, ""how can dead people do..."" various actions; if you can't suspend disbelief with a basic spook film like this, then you have no business watching a film meant for surreal entertainment.Anyways, from start to finish the film is great, over the top, and plain, popcorn level, FUN. If you get a scare, and I think you will, then it does its job. Unless, of course, you think that some spook might steal your job :-)"
1,Simply Awfull,"This is a terrible re-make of the original movie, which was quite good. What a waste of talent, stay away from this mish-mash of a movie."
3,There are some nice horror visuals here... and the story isn't too bad.,"House on Haunted Hill is your standard ""group killed off one by one but no one knows who it is"" ghost movie, and on that level, it works, despite having ""been there done that"". With that said, there are decent performances, but what really saves this film is the horror visuals and special FX, which are a little 'trippy' considering a asylum doctor who appears on the monitor, and his head flicks back and forth very quickly. Yes, it was based on an earlier work but it works well here, along with the basic gore FX and dark castle/mansion setting.The pace is decent, and there are some memorable kills. I've seen worse, and at best, this is a slightly above average ghost film."
5,Much Better Than The Original!,As far as scary movies go this is one of my favorites! Don't waste your time on the original - watch this one!
3,SCARED THE SH** OUT OF ME!,"Reading a reveiw from an eleven year old, this movie totally freaked me out. After I watched this movie, I did not even want to move a finger, a leg, or even BLINK! What would you do with 1,000,000...dollars? A group of people are uninvited but come anyway to the house on the hill that was a hospital, and now are getting killed off one by one. It was totally SCARY! I regret myself for reminding myself on that one scene with the video camera - SH**! That was scary! Worth watching."
2,"Oh, the horror!",Quite a tedious movie I must say. For fans of horror this film fails to show anything truly scary. Chris Kattan displayed some terrific acting though. But the whole idea was it to be scary and it failed to do that for me.
4,I was on the edge of my seat,This movie is the only movie that made me a little scared and no movie usually makes me scared. So I give this movie a A+ for that. But overall the story line is a little rusty but I say this is a must see movie.
3,The Rollercoaster Ride Falls Off Track at the End,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodFun remake of the 50's Vincent Price classic, ""the House on Haunted Hill."" Worth the price of admission for the chemistry alone between Geoffery Rush & the ever beautiful Famke Janssen, as husband & wife who don't exactly make holy matrimony, to say the least, as both think one is trying to kill the other. Funny dialog with a witty twist expound from both, as the guests look anxiously on, befuddled at the whole scenario.The guests make for good victim fodder, as their one dimensional characters. You'll have fun picking & rooting for the ones you hope get killed next, & that's exactly what their in this film for, to be murdered, one by one.Good pacing & special effects make this one a fun amusement ride, though the rollercoaster falls off track in the end, otherwise I would've rated this a half star higher. Still, this film does not take it's self seriously, & if you don't, this makes for a very good Halloween time watch!"
2,Failure...,"I cannot imagine how could this be rated as Horror or Thriller!!!The DVD menus are brilliant although it may not be very clear for the eye due ti the animations... the extras are wonderful. And the film started very successfuly, I thought that this would be a very nice one... all went well until it has got to into a weak science fiction drama!I mean for God's sake, why didn't the story continue went as a psycho killer? Why did it has to become an unreasonable story?!! Oh and the ending is very very very weak..."
2,Wasn't even Scary,"This is a real bad horror movie. Not funny, not scary, just a waste of two hours of my life."
2,Insult to the Original,"I am especially disturbed by the scads of movies made recently which have mindboggling great special effects but crappy storylines and charecterizations. (DeepBlueSea, Godzilla, Twister, etc etc etc) I'm not even going to bother comparing this to the 1950s classic, I don't think remakes are always a bad idea but in that case, I think the charming tale is a period piece which tampering could only reveal how life in the modern era lets us down. Computers can't create terror in my opinion. I also detest the portrayal of the millionaire's wife in this flick. Aren't we sick of the stereotype of ""the gold hunting evil woman fooling around"". Haven't we moved beyond this? But I can't diss the flick entirely. The idea behind this film is decidedly creepy. It isn't a boring movie by any means either. The ending is quite poor however."
1,Why did I bother?,"I kind of wanted to see this movie when it originally came out in theaters, but I never got around to it...I'm glad I didn't. This movie was really bad. Most of the scenes just didn't make any sense. The characters weren't likeable at all, I couldn't have cared less if they all got killed. The acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous. Some of the worst lines came from chris kattan's character like, ""this house is alive, we're all gonna die"" and ""you give me my money right now...I want it, so you give it"". Thats the kind of bad script that I'm talking about. The only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects. I would also like to give credit to geoffery rush for trying to do the best he could with what he was given. All and all...don't watch this movie."
2,"Ok, but not great...",House on Haunted Hill is great movie for those that don't want to really think about what they are watching.
3,Not Bad 3.4/5,This was a pretty good movie it starts off kinda lame and bloody but it got better so its good for renting.
2,the original was good,"i wouldn't consider this a remake--but a similar plot to a different movie. liked this movie, but i sure wouldn't compare it to the original."
3,A neat little thriller,"Three stars and part of another one. I was expecting a possibly entertaining little piece of junk, based on what I'd heard about it. But THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL was a pleasant surprise, with a howlingly funny opening, a fairly witty script, likeable performances by Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen, and a pretty creepy bunch of set pieces--especially some of the quick, atmospheric shots of Jeffrey Combs as the classic mad doctor. Nice use of CGI -- unlike the recent HAUNTING, the effects don't come off like cartoons. They're pretty scary, as a matter of fact. All in all, a very pleasant diversion for an evening."
1,Very Disturbing,"This movie has some very disturbing images in it. The plot started out well, but then just turned sick, the ending is like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, it never would have happened anywhere else, but Hollywood. A horrible movie."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I'm kind of in between on this movie. The opening sequences involving the asymlum gave me high hopes that this would be a serious and scary movie, but as the movie went on it became clear to me that the movie makers didn't understand the meaning of the word enough. On top everything else was the ""unnamed"" (and cheesy) evil in the basement really necessary? (or if it was why show us bad special effects instead of just letting it be creepy and invisible?) Wasn't the ghostly doctor enough?However, once I accepted that this movie wasn't going to scare me (only gross me out from time to time)I was at least amused.For former fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000 this is a good movie to rent with a pack of friends and laugh at."
4,"A worthy remake on a classic theme, with a PC dose","Haunted houses, evil scientists and an obligatory black man to save white women from a possesed house and the drunken incompetence of white guys. Captured is the 'campy' feel that I find missing in many modern films. This combined with some good shocks and some 'chewey' scenes make for a good evening away from reality."
3,"Freaky, yes; greatest movie? no.",This was probably one of the grossest movies I've seen. Every minute something was happening. It's an ok movie just to see and to talk about; nothing special. I mean there are some chessy little lines in it. Something you wouldn't want to watch alone at night.
4,WICKED AZZ MOVIE THAT YOU WILL LIKE !!!,"THIS MOVIE IS THE WICKEDEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN THE LONGEST TIME I SWEAR TO YOU.THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IN THIS MOVIE ARE JUST FAB.THE HOUSE JUST PLAYS WITH THE PEOPLE,THROUGH THE WHOLE NIGHT.THIS ONE GIRL WAS FOLLOWING DIGGS AND IT ENDED UP BEING A GHOST.ANOTHER GIRL IS WATCHING HER VIDEO CAMERA AND SHE SEES DOCTORS OPERATING ON A PATIENT AND WHEN SHE WAS TO LOOK OFF THE CAMERA THE DOCTORS WEREN'T THERE,I'M TELLING YA IT'S A WICKED MOVIE.I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS MOVIE NOW,IT'S A KEEP."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"I HAD SEEN THE ORIGINAL YEAR AGO, AND BY FAR THE ORINGINAL IS THE BEST. THE SPECIAL EFFECT IN THE REAMKE ARE VERY WELL DONE. THE ORIGINAL IS SCARIER AND BETTER. THE ACTORS IN THE ORIGINAL DO A BETTER JOB OF LEADING YOU INTO THE PLOT."
3,You Know,"This film was alright. It wasn't all that scary, and it was a little bit scary and fun. But amazon.com is right it's one of those genre waste time films that they don't put alot of detail into. All the movie cares about is being scared which the film did have. It's really gory at the begining and through out the film but I recommend it, if your in the mood for lots of gore and a little scare."
1,Very Bad Taste,This movie would have been the laughing stock of Vincent Price if he had starred in this one. If he were alive today he would have not even endorsed such a bad choice of a movie. Dont waste your money on even renting this one. If I could have Id given this movie a negative star.
1,The most effective sleeping-pill imagineable,"I don't know what's the big deal with this movie. I bought it because I love scary movies and I sold it the next day after I saw it cuz it was not scary at all. The effects are pretty cool, but from Producer Joel Silver (""The Matrix"" you'd expect a lot more. ""It's the house, It's alive! "" Please..... A good Actor named Geoffrey Rush has wasted his time and a lot of bad actors have proved what they are.... I've never seen a more boring film than this cause every step they make is predictable. Let's forget this movie and enjoy better work of Joel and Geoffrey"
1,See the Vincent Price version,This movie was downright HORRIBLE! It wasn't scary. They thought they could rely on the blood and gore to make this a good movie. Guess What? It didn't work. The original with Vincent Price is so much better than this piece of garbage they call a movie!
3,Not good but not bad either....,"The only thing that save this movie is if you have some ""Resident Evil experience"". Otherwise, too much gore, but the special effect is terrible. It is just a rip off of Vincent Price classic, too many violent but cannot beat the original version."
1,This movie was bad!,"This movie was bad for several reasons...1. It was not even a house, it was an old asylum!2. The characters argue too much!3. The opening scene was too over-whelming with blood and gore!4. The building's external surroundings kept changing!5. Too much use of the F-word!6. They seem to use the same sets over and over again, just dressed-updifferent!7. The movie does not even give us one good 'BOO'!8. The movie was not scary, it was a gore-fest!9. The f/x are not that good!10. It is never fully explained why that one room is wherethe evil of the building is festering!Over-all, the movie was a major disappointment! Watch the originalclassic starring Vincent Price, it may be old, but worth watching!My grade: D- or one star!"
4,Awesome - just don't watch the ending,"This is one of my favs, for sure. Cool concept, fun cast, good sets, etc. Just stop the movie short of the ending, its absurd. The movie is very enjoyable without the ending, and you'll lose nothing (save for some laughs) by skipping it."
3,"IT WAS GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS ""THE HAUNTING""","If you compare Geoffrey Rush's ""haunted house flick"" to Jan de Bont's ""haunted house flick"", the odds are that ""The Haunting"" will win the match. Though this film had me jumping a few times, the haunting had a much better plot. House on Haunted Hill (1958) was much better. The music was creepier as well and it was much more classic. Though this movie is not as bad as some movie I've seen in my day, I don't think it's worth over $9.99."
2,CGI Horror,"House on Haunted Hill has a very interesting premise and a very likeable cast but somehow manages to fall flat despite all its truly horrific intentions. Problem lies with the direction. With the only other major film to the directors credit, Universal Soldier : The Return, I rest my case. Hill goes completely overboard on the CGI towards the end much like ""The Haunting"" and what we are left with is a laughable attempt at recreating the horror and tension of the original 1950's version. Good for a laugh or two but a scare, I think youll be more scared in Scooby Doo's mysteries on cartoon network."
3,Spooky and Mildly Entertaining!,"While the plot does fall flat and some of the performances weren't that good. This little horror flick does have a lot to offer. Geoffrey Rush gives an amusing over the top performance that ultimately steals the show, I also enjoyed Chris Kattan in a really funny part. It does offer some genuinely scary moments, and some images of sadism and madness, which are elevated by great use of editing and sound. But other than that the movie does offer some laughable scenes that seem out of place, and the ending is not as scary as it should be considering what came before it. Passable if you are an undemanding horror buff. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 6!"
3,it's ok!,"I was so excited thinking that this movie was going to be really scary, but i am disappointed to say that it wasn't!I admit there were some parts that were scary!This is the only reason i'm giving it 3 stars!I thought the movie was just plain GROSS!Ok it need to be a little sick to be an actual HORROR movie which this was not! it was a perfectly good waste of money and of time! SO if you really have nothing to do than that's fine but if your looking for a real SCARE you should look elsewhere cause this movie is not for you!"
1,Hollow Horror,"I can't believe how boring I found this film. ""The Munsters"" is more frightening. It's just another slasher film with no suspense. Comparisons have been made to older films like Vincent Price's wonderfully campy ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" but this doesn't come close. Maybe it really points out how significant Vincent Price was to those other films."
4,Scares and fun in one movie...,"This was the movie that did it to me. Until i saw this i wasn't really into horror, but after seeing this movie i was hooked. Not usualy my thing, with young beutiful people in it (not including Rush). I found this movie very watchable but, for some reason, uneasy too. It wasn't a comedy horror, but it was fun and actually scared me at some points. All in all, very easy to watch and enjoyable. But i can see it dating poorly. 4 stars is fair i think. Check it out. Enjoy!"
2,"Slow, and not too scary.","It was a slow, and sort of boring plot line. I followed with distaste, A few places in the movie gave me a start, but I wouldn't watch it again,"
1,"It's the most cheesiest, most perdictable film ever!","I rented this film and I was very very very much disappointed in it. First of all, the plot was just plain stupid and the acting, ugh, the acting was frightning. I thought the movie was supposed to be that but no. It turns out that House on Haunted Hill is a frivolous 1hr and 30min mess that sould of never been put out again. If you want to laugh really hard then buy it. It's not my money. If you want to be thrilled or scared out of your witts then buy something else because House on Haunted Hill just doesn't cut it. . .at all. It blends comedy, horror(ha ha), and unnecsessary nudity! COME ON!"
1,0 STARS: You gotta be freaking kidding me!!!,"The movie ""The House on Haunted Hill"" is a cheesey and stupid attempt to make a haunted house movie. The movie simply isn't scary and fails to evoke any interest from any sophisiticated horror movie fan.Despite opinions to the contrary, the acting is terrible...the movie suffers from the unintentional comedy syndrome in which this movie tries to be scary but becomes more of an unintentional comedy and a total joke. However, despite how truly awful this movie is, I would STILL give this movie a slight edge over that trashy remake of ""The Haunting."" Nevertheless, stay away from this rubbish if you're interested in a real horror movie.Bottom Line: this movie is supposed to be a horror movie and it simply fails in its goal to produce a scary atmosphere rendering this movie a total bore and a complete waste of time."
1,More proof that you can't make the orignal better,"In 10 words or less, this movie was terrible! I mean it had no real plot and just kept dragging on and on. If you've ever seen a horror film in your life, you'll predict everything that's going to happen. The only thing I was surprised about was how the final ""evil"" would look, but other than that, it was totally not scary. The movie basically begged you to turn it off ""End me...End me! For God's sake, end me!"" I wouldn't recommend watching this movie or think about watching it unless you need a cure for insomnia."
2,Stupid and Boring,"This is a ""in desperate need rental"". Many times I have avoided renting it because of that feeling. You know when a movie is just going to fall short of anyting but entertaining. Well it feel very short. Half way through I noticed that my apartment needed cleaning so the movied played as I cleaned and I did not miss much. The plot is predictable. Characters are flat. If you want a pretty good scary movie with a house that's alive rent The Haunting. You will get much better acting and special effects."
5,A scary treat!,This is a scary movie. I loved it. The DVd is great with good features. You will like it.
3,UHH . . . OKAY,"PERSONALLY, I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE A DUPLICATE OF ""THE HAUNTING"",THE MOVIE WITH LIAM NEESON AND KATHERINE ZETA-JONES, NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ""THE HAUNTING"" WAS MUCH WORSE THAN MY EXPECTIONS. BUT ""HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL"" WASN'T THAT BAD. IN FACT I LIKED THE MOVIE. I ADMIT THAT THE ENDING WAS STUPID WHEN ADI LARTER AND TAYE DIGGS LAUGH AT THE END. I PERSONALLY WOULD HAVE LIKED IT IF THEY SPACED OUT UNTIL THE END OF THE MOVIE. BUT EVEN IF I DIDN'T LIKE THE ENDING, I LOVED THE FACT THAT CHRIS KATTAN SAVES THEM AT THE END.... I ALSO LOVED HOW THE GHOSTS DID THAT HYPERACTIVE SHAKE WITH THEIR HEADS. I KNOW IT'S A TAKE-OFF FROM ""JACOB'S LADDER,"" BUT IT HELPED THE MOVIE SO MUCH! IF MY 7 YEAR-OLD NEPHEW, WHO CANNOT RIDE A ROLLER COASTER, ISN'T SCARED OF THIS MOVIE, THEN I KNOW THAT THIS MOVIE ISN'T SCARY,PERIOD. BUT THE COOLEST PART WAS THE MAIN SONG ""SWEET DREAMS"" BY MARILYN MANSON."
2,Well...,It wasn't what I expected that's for sure. The operation scene had me gagging. I don't do medical stuff. I expected the movie to be scary...but just...well...stupid scary. It was better than I thought it was going to be but still it wasn't that great. And the pessimistic owner guy ROX!
4,VISUAL EYE CANDY,"i loved the way this movie was filmed. yes, i does look alittle like a TOOL video, but then again they do the best music videos anyway. the story was decent although the ending was a flop. the acting was solid all the way through. i enjoyed all but the last 5 minutes of this movie. i loved the beginning with the rollercoaster, i'd love to get on a ride like that, it'd scar the s**t out of me."
4,Great movie!,"I thought that this movie was great. I personally believe that if they gave this another title and didnt associate it with the original then people would of looked on it with a new light and see just how good it was. It had action and voilence and gore everything i loved it! The only flaw was some of the acting and wat they said; for example at the end when the two of them r on the window sill after they escaped the guy said something like ""that was a kickass party"" even though i know this is a entertainment movie that just annoyed me because after staying in a house like that and seeing all thos murders and ghost nobody would just say that as a joke! haha well besides that this was def. a great movie"
4,Probably the most fun haunted house movie around.,"Five people (including the lovely Ali Larter) are offered a million dollars each to spend the night in a run-down mental ward. The catch is, the ghosts of the patients and doctors aren't happy and they want these guests to join them! Fast-paced and gory ride is the textbook definition of a party film: Low on brains but loud, creepy and scary, and just plain fun. There's the occasional overdone scene and the movie loses some momentum in the last five minutes, but it's still a fun ride and certainly far superior to the remake of The Haunting (And the more recent Thir13een Ghosts, which similarly tried to be a loud, gory carnival ride). Geoffrey Rush and Chris Kattan are hilarious standouts."
2,poorly made,"this is a poorly made version of a classic. though the actors are well known they sure know how to pick movie parts. Famke Janssen(Deep Rising) is very bitchy in this one and when she got hers I was satisfyed. I liked the fact that Taye Diggs(New Best Friend) and Ali Larter(American Outlaws) survived because they were the best people in that movie. Chris Kattan(Corky Romano), Geoffrey Rush(MysteryMen), Bridgette Wilson(I Know What You Did Last Summer), Peter Gallagher(tv's The O.C.), Max Perlich(Drugstore Cowboy and tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Lisa Loeb(the singer), Jeffrey Combs(Re-Animator 1,2&3) and James Marsters(Spike on Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) also costar. the slayings are somewhat disgusting, the dialouge suck and some good actors are wasted playing dumb roles."
5,It Was Great,"Hello, If you like Movie's were people are in a Haunted House and there is Gore, lots Action and a great actors Then you will like this Movie....."
1,Awful,"Sure, the original Vincent Price film was cheesy, but it's a classic. This film is neither cheesy or a classic, it's just plain BAD. I don't understand what the draw to this type of ""horror"" is; it's simply not scarry.Poorly made, bad acting, bad everything... don't waste your time."
1,not recommended,"I do not care if this is better than the original movie. It's still bad.Prepare yourself for a predictable movie, with flat characters, boring plot, bad acting and a really really bad ending(think Stephen King, perhaps even worse).There is some interesting scenographics and camera shooting in this movie, but it's all ruined by bad acting and badly chosen music. It would have been better to cut all the good scenes together and make a music video out of it.It has some entertainment value, but I wouldn't recommend spending any money on it.Instead I'd recommend seeing Session 9, because that one is really worth both the time and the money."
4,I give it three for its storyline but it has some good scares,"I didn't really see anything impressive with this storyline- I give it a three.But if you like being scared/startled and if you like suspence in that sense this film delivers-I rate it between a four and a five. This film is definitely scarier than a great deal of other ""horror"" movies."
5,Watch this in the dark,"This is a great movie to watch while you're alone, and in the dark! The actors in this creepy film are great. Geoffrey Rush easily pulls off the roll as a rich amusement park owner. Famke Janssen plays his spoiled wife Evelyn. This film sends chills up your back as you begin to realize that this innocent birthday party may turn a funeral party quickly. If you want a good spook, watch this film, but remember alone and in the DARK!"
3,Strange..,"I watched this movie at night,lights out,and i was not scared but a little spooked. I did,however,find this movie to be very strange but a lot better than these so-called 'scary' movies that are out..(I.E. Blair Witch) It's about a Haunted House (You guessed that already..hehe) and people go to it to stay there over night and get money. I have one simple,simple question..If all the murders were down in the basement then WHY did they keep on going down there? They would have been a lot safer upstairs than in the basement...who goes wandering in the basement after somebody's been murdered down there? But,it was very enjoyable and i recommend it to people who like movies such as this one. Slightly bloody,nothing to,to terrible. (people with slightly weak stomaches be a lil' careful while watching this..)"
3,House on Haunted Hill,"The recent remake of the 1958 classic ""House on Haunted Hill"" isn't near as good as the original, but it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. In ""House on Haunted Hill"", a neglected wife plans on having her birthday party inside the walls of an abandoned asylum where the most gruesome mass murders occured. The guest list her husband made out for the party was deleted by a ghost, who invited decendants of the workers that survived the tragedy in the old asylum. Steven Price, the owner of Price amusement parks, offers the five invited each a check for $1,000,000 if they can live through the night. If you love good scares and a very creative story, you should check this movie out. Also, if you are a fan of blood and gore, this movie is for you."
2,Below average Horror movie.,"This film is about 5 Pretty people got a invite to a haunted house to spend a night, and who ever can survive the night will receive a million dollars. This film try too much to be scary, but never managing it. You will pretty much knows what's going to happen next from the start to the end and knows who will die and so on. The film is pretty light on the gore, the opening sequence is the scariest part of the film, and the rest rely too much on the special effects. The film itself looks good and the horror sequences are well done but they've all been done before, but there's no major shocks or twist to surprise the audience. Overall, the film is pretty average on the verge of being bad. I suggest you rent it out first before you buy it."
5,House on Haunted Hill 1999,"It might not be the Stellar Original(1959) but I enjoyed it nonetheless, I liked Chris Katan's Role in the movie too."
2,Special Effects take over this movie!Watch the original!,"This remake is sadly just a big movie for special effects overkill!It's so much like ""The Haunting "" it's laughable!But if you must buy this movie do it on DVD! at least on DVD , we get commentary from the director,delated scenes(some of which I made the movie!), a compare and contrast between this ""House"" and the orginal with Vincent Price! But I prefer the orginal with it chessy effects and a great story about a wife plotting to kill her husband(in the original at least her plan backfires!)Do yourself a favor and skip this special effects overkill movie and watch the original instead!But if you have a DVD player by all means buy this movie and watch the special features in the DVD(it will make the remake made a litter more sense!)"
3,*~House on Haunted Hill- Gimme a Break,This movie had a great plot- excellent cast (Especially one of my favorite actresses and my role model Bridgette Wilson). Five People survive they get a million each. But theres a catch- ghosts! They all seem to die here and there and let me tell u the cover box is decieveing. Bridgette is barely in here boo-hoo. NOT FAIR!
4,Better than the original.,"I know I'm gonna bet beat up for saying that, but in my oppinion, this is better than the original. The original was more along the lines of a dark comedy. This one actually packs some scares. It's funnier than scary though. Watch it by yourself, with the lights off!"
4,Funny - but not helpful.,"Someone recommended this book to me as something that would help me deal with my own mother. This book is funny, but if you're having a real problem dealing with your ""Jewish mother"" and want peaceful ideas on how to cope, this is NOT the book for you. If you just want to read something kinda funny, go for it.If, however, you are tired of your mother (or father) using the guilt tactics on you, you should try ""Toxic Parents"" or ""Children of the Self Absorbed"". These books offer constructive ways to actually get over emotional abuse. I know there is a small chance that you searched for this book looking for actualy help, but just in case, I hope I gave you some constructive options."
3,"mediocre, when i woke or remember would be a better choice","i bought this album expecting the wonderful music of rusted root i have heard on albums such as when i woke, remember, and cruel sun. although i love rusted root, there was a disappointment when i heard this album. i still liked it, but if you're looking for a rusted root cd and you don't own any, don't let this be your first impression."
3,"The Root needs to get back to its roots, literally!","I like it but it is not nearly as good as When I woke (or even Remember ) . Unfortunately , the root is so into ""experimenting"" with whatever feels good musically and ""broadening"" their horizons that they have lost touch with what made them so good originally. They need to get back to the hip swayin', pot smokin', spoon on the washboard tribal sound."
4,Not quite the energy of their live shows,"I've been fortunate enough to know this band since their inception into the neo-hippie music scene in 1990. Their first two studio albums, the independently released ""Cruel Sun"" and their major label debut ""When I Woke"" captured the fundamental element of the band that makes its loyal listeners come back time and time again to see them perform live. The second major label output (Remember) missed the mark completely of capturing this live element. However, this album puts the band back on track even though its laden at times with electric guitars and overdubs, which causes the powerful and brilliant work by their rythym section to be obscured in a musical goo. In other words, this album doesn't measure to their first two works but a very good effort nonetheless."
3,Less show=more glow,3 1/2This more restrained effort suits the band best and helps clarify their sound past a drum circle party.
1,Wouldn't buy this based on the clips,"I came here on a recommendation from a friend as a ""must buy"" and after listening to the clips, every song sounds more or less the same and the lead vocalist seems to sing in the same notes and key in each song. Sort of reminds me of an updated ""hootie"" sound. Not innovative sounding enough to make me want to spend money on this album."
4,Rusted Root S/T,"I am listening to this right now. Certainly not my favorite RR album, but it is still quite enjoyable. It has a more light-hearted feel than most of their other stuff, which makes for enjoyable listening even if there isn't as much under the surface, musically. I love the duo of Airplane into Agbadza, which both also fit nicely with My Love earlier on (all three of which admittedly recall the group's older material). Of course the Stones cover is awesome. 4 stars."
1,"Stick with ""When I Woke""","I'm with the other reviewers who felt ""When I Woke"" was Root's best CD: better percussion, better vocal quality, better cohesion. While one can't really understand their lyrics much in ""Woke"" (reminds one of speaking in tongues) I still feel they do a better job than when one can actually hear and understand the lyrics in this CD. I do think they're a highly gifted group in their musicianship, however, which still comes through on this production."
5,Extremely innovative and their best album yet!,"In today's world of cheesy music manufactured on drum machines, it's great to see a band with some real legitimate talent. They play all kinds of different ethnic instruments as well as the traditional guitar, drums, etc. They have a distinctly tribal feel yet I would still classify them as pop. You just have to listen to them to understand what I mean. This album is definitely their best, too. They use a lot of distortion to give it a kind of psychadelic feel. It's great!"
5,Best book I have read about Michael Jackson.,I have read many books about Michael Jackson. But nothing even come close to His own words..This book make's you feel as if he is talking to you only. And it puts light on every thing He has ever said about him self and his family. I have been a huge fan of his my whole life and never had the chance to read his book till now.. And I thank God for letting me. And thank Michael for writing it. I miss him a ton and this book just puts so much light on him and the life he had. Thank you again Michael for letting us all have just a little bit of you.Life Commemorative: Michael JacksonMichael Jackson: This Is ItColleen Engels
4,Moonwalk,"A wonderful book. A true collectors book with a autograph by the King himself. It doesn't tell much about his personal life, but it tells alot about the creative side of Michael Jackson. I am so glad I bought it."
5,EPIC,IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. i FELT AS IF MICHAEL WAS TALKING TO ME THE WHOLE TIME. AND NO MY CAPS IS NOT LOVED I LOVED IT A LOOOOTTTTTTT ! ! ! ! ! ! !
3,"The book is so so, but the service ended up being great!","MoonwalkThis book was so, so. Michael provided incite on some things but not enough about anything. It also appeared to me that there were two different writing styles: one by a student and one style by an adult. But what I want to say is that the copy that I purchased as new was indeed used. I contacted the seller about my concern that it wasn't a new copy and was very pleased with the response from the seller, IFORGOTMYNAME. She told me that my receiving a used copy instead of an new copy was a mistake and to make up for the mistake, she refunded my purchase immediately. I initially didn't think that I would use this seller again but with the positive response I received, I've changed my mind and will purchase again from IFORGOT MY NAME. Remember her name, she's professional and honest."
3,Could have been a lot better,"MJ really held back in this book, he didn't mention anything about Vitiligo, I felt that was cowardly on his part, He gave so much to charity, I wonder did he give anything for Vitiligo research cure or something. This book was good on MJ's music career but sucked on MJ's personal life because he held back too much, he said nothing about the abuse from his father, he says nothing about the bond with his brothers except him and Jermaine were closest cause they shared hotel rooms together, he seemed to have really only bonded with Janet, and his mom as far as family is concerned. He doesn't talk about any of his relationships, with women this book kinda sucked."
4,Untitled,"When I received this book, It was the in the condition that I was told it would be in. It was on time, I wont hesitate to order from this company again. and it was a good read. I was hoping for more depth in the story, especially between him and his father. and little bit more about the early years. It really, relies alot on the pictures to tell the story, also the story is over before you know it. It could have delved into the business end of his life more. But was worth not hearing it from the scandal sheets."
5,omg i love this book,this book is amazing. i enjoyed reading this book i mean it felt like michael was siting i front of me telling me about his life story. it feels like ive known him for years. besides it also feel like hes watching you when you read this book :)i smiled when i read in one part of michaels book that he was chasing fran dileo around with his pet snake named muscles.
3,Michael Jackson,"There is so much that has gone on in Michael Jacksons life it seems impossible for him to write it all down in a book and the fact that Michael still wishes to keep his privacy, it seems like Michael has only expressed the bare minimum of himself in order for him to keep some of his privacy. Even his family members have said that the book is cold and expresses little about Michael. The Magic and the madness is a great book telling the hidden facts about Michael and his family that he wishes to keep hidden. He often tell us something but stops and does not tell us why it happened or how he felt about it happening and being such an emotional person i am sure he was deffinatly not as happy and understanding about everything and everyone who has passed through his career."
5,Moonwalk by Michael Jackson,This book was Everything I expected!I recieved it on time and in Perfect condition!Thank You Amazon. com !I'm A Very Satisfied Customer!Neva
4,who binded these books?,"I just received my book today so haven't read it, but did go through it and look at the pictures. It seems some of them were cut off in the wrong spot and the ""centerfold"" was not cut all the way down so I ripped a piece of it to open it only to see another picture that seemed to be cut in the wrong spot. I have plenty of pictures of him so I won't be sending it back but found it to feel thrown together without care. I'm hoping the pages are in order at least!"
5,Moon walk,good book easy to read an a true account by Michael with out all the lies and trash that some people have writtenour of greed and try to make money
4,90% Happy,"I purchased Moonwalk, which I have owned a copy before, but it was ruined. I was happy with the product except there was an issue concerning the dust jacket. Originally it had a dust jacket, the seller put it in the mail and then the seller said it was returned without the jacket. What? I did not uderstand this. I told the seller please resend it, and send it certified so that it could be tracked. I received the book and it was in god condition, I would not buy from the seller again, but I was happy with the book."
4,The real Michael,I was very amazed when I finished this book because it was very detailed. Michael Jackson explains everything about his life to the day when he found his dad's guitar and became interested in music to him releasing BAD. I personally loved this book because it was probobly going to be the closest I would ever get to the King of PoP. I recamend this book to every one out there who thinks Michael is a freak and who have nothing but bad things to say about him. YOU ARE ALL WRONG! In this book I found himself to be a very down to Earth and Caring guy.
5,One of the most awesome books I have read,"I have learned so much about Michael that I never knew. I like being able to hear his story from him and not a third pary that does not know what is really going on. This book makes me laugh, cry, and smile. through it I can see his life through him. It makes me love and respect him that much more for all he went through and did to make albums that he knew his fans would love. If only every artist did what he did. But this book is a testament to why he was loved like he was. A must read for all Michael Jackson fans"
3,"Pretty Good, But don't expect any bombshells!",I actually enjoyed reading this book. I did read quite a few other books about MJ and his family and already knew about some of the stories he discussed. His accounts of the 'abuse' his father layed down on the family was actually mild compared to what he has discussed in interviews. So either he is 'sparing us the details' or it wasn't as extreme as he has implied in the past. He only touches on his supposed relationship with Brooke Shields (I read in Taraborrelli's book that MJ 'liked' her but only hung out with her to 'help' her career). But at the same time I can't stand her so maybe I overlooked something. Other than that it was an interesting glimpse of MJ as a person.
2,Kindel Edition,Can Amazon or any of the customers please explain the reason of the Kindle version being expensive than the hardcover or paper back version. I expected the Kindle Versions of the books to be cheaper else what is the reason of investing in a Kindle.
2,Don't Even Bother,"The book was pretty weak you can tell that Michael really wanted to go in depth about the music business, his family, and the pressures of being a mega superstar. But Michael just held off I thought the purpose of this book was about getting everythin off his chest. He just played it straight and kept it very bland. I mean most of what he spoke about you already knew W.T.H. Mike ??? but you're still the man R.I.P. ""King Of Pop"""
2,It was ok,"The book actually repeated itself so many times. You could have took half the pages out. I was not that impressed. Did not learn anything new and michael did not really open up and share anything that we already didn't know. It was more like he was ""defending"" himself in regards to the media and the press. If you want to read a good book where you actually learn things about Michael Jackson, read: Michael Jackson: The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story, 1958-2009."
1,Poor Michael,"Moonwalk is a poorly written, hyper-superficial account of the life and times of this pop music master. I came upon it accidentally and am sorry to say that it did not deliver in either content or quality. Michael needs an editor--badly. Moonwalk is with plagued by short, choppy, attemping-at-profound, diatribe that mar this memoir. Published in 1988, the current edition has illustrations added in 1998--sans detail of his marriage/divorce to Priscilla Presley, allegations of sexual misconduct with a young boy. No doubt that Jackson is a creative genius but he'll never win the Pulitzer."
4,The most mysterious man sheds a little light,"If you want to know something about anybody it seems their account would be preferable to another biographer. ""Moonwalker"" is authored by the man everyone desires to learn about. For this reason alone it deserves to be read by any Michael Jackson fan. It does a great job revealing the real Michael Jackson, and it's the closest any of his fans will ever get to actually talking to him. The only thing that degrades this book is the simplicity in which it is written (I read this 200+ page book in 4 days), I would have been delighted if Michael chose to write with a little more inventiveness and creative zest, something I'm sure he is capable of; perhaps not now, but then in 1988."
5,MJ Moonwalk,"This book is awesome I love it and I like the fact that MICHAEL JACKSON wrote it himself and it is very detailed and he goes in depth of his music career and this book is the only one I'll purchase because it is straight from Michael's words and no one else's, I'm not interested in tabloids or other people's input of the KING OF POP, I rate it a 12."
5,Excellent book,I'm glad I've purchased this book and happy that the publisher reprinted some copies. It just confirms what kind of person is Michael Jackson. He is just like a human being like everyone else who deserves respect and privacy. My admiration goes to his family especially to his Mom for raising these nine children in a loving way.
4,They look good,"These shoes are good looking. They hold up very well to scuffs and wear. The only problem I have with them is that the front of the shoe isn't very tall, so if you have big toes/fat feet, it's going to cause some mild pain by the end of the day. It's not anything you'd notice if you were just wearing the shoes for a couple hours."
2,"A LITTLE book, indeed","To have this book labeled Paperback edition of the original SUPERB hardcover book without qualification is a little bit too much for me.Even at a quarter of the price, this 4 1/2 inch book is nothing compared to the original edition.And still I don't regret having it, because it reminds me of the big hardcover book..."
2,Each of the season 4 episodes on this disc are not worth it.,"Please note that this is not a review for kids. It's a review for critically minded adults who very much liked all the spongebob episodes from the first three seasons. I own all episodes from the first 3 seasons on DVD collections, and watch them regularly. There is a sharp shift from those seasons to the 4th season. (The episodes on this disc are 4th season.) The comedic timing is off in every 4th season episode that I've seen, including all those on this disc. The characters have shifted, and the net effect is a work that seems to be based on Spongebob while completely missing the mark. ""The Great Snail Race,"" the only 3rd season episode on this disc, highlights the fact that all the 4th season episodes are unwatchable. I read one review that said something to the effect of, ""if you have the first 3 seasons, keep those and pass this disc by."" I didn't listen."
5,5 stars,"I loved this VHS form of Where's Gary? It may not be cheap, but it's worth every penny!This video indlucded every heartwarming detail of the sepisodes, and four additional ones. It also included a song (Come home Gary) at the end.You won't waste your money on this!"
5,yay by hilfan90210 from l.i.n.y.,i luv sb! the episodes are:have you seen this snail?good neighbors (whatz wit da phezez?)the great snail race (how did tentacles turn into torlini?)skill crane (y kant i win 1?)the lost mattress (y prime cutz?)&krabz vs. plankton (can some1 tell me wat happend)what happend 2 dat doctor guy shown in seasons 1-3? he wasnt in funny pants & now i think bout him & itz DRIVING ME INSANE!!!!!
2,Watch out - This is a Miniature Edition,"This is not the regular edition, but a special miniature edition: 5 1/2"" x 7"". The content of this book is excellent. Lot's of high quality illustrations, easy to understand."
3,Not a real 'Angus' Sound,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great guitar, but so are just about all Gibsons. But if you want that signature ""Angus"" AC/DC sound, don't get this guitar, get the '61 Reissue. It is a much better guitar, and is cheaper. Don't waste your time with this. The features are more of a gimmick than truly useful."
3,Ive played this guitar many times before,"okay really the last person who reviewed this.. no the guitar isnt as great as you say it is. I have Zakk's pickup compbo. the 81 and 85 EMG's . and theyre a lot better than the ones in the angus. The angus is a good guitar but the only reason i would buy it would be if i were madly in love with Angus Young ... Or if i were really extremely stupid. You can get a lot better guitars with the money that the Angus costs. I would reccomend a different gibson. and if you're looking to buy one of these guitars, i would ALSO reccomend not listening to the other person who reviewed this before me"
2,"Tedious, Overly-Amazed by Well-Known/Boring Facts","This book is packed with a lot of facts - too many facts, and no central theme to thread them all together. And the dull prose - more or less in the style of a mother explaining things to a not-so-bright child - adds no narrative or entertainment value.The dustcover promises an entertaining read, but all we get is a tedious recitation of widely-known or terminally boring facts, all of them presented in the tone of one recommending them for inclusion in Ripley's Believe It Or Not. Yawn."
1,Too Diverse,"The author explores the role and impact of dust-sized particles in settings as diverse as galaxies and your own home. Unfortunaely this very diversity keeps the book from hanging together very well. The chapters, severely truncated, would have done better as individual magazine articles."
4,"Often fascinating, sometimes dull.","Writing is excellent, although occasionally a certain ""breathlessness"" in tone becomes wearying. There are a number of unresolved scientific questions, such as the cause of asthma, and Holmes does a particularly good job with these. The material on dust and weather is fascinating. While Holmes' sympathies are clear, she remains objective. Despite Holmes' best efforts, however, the underlying material is not uniformly interesting. For example, there are some interesting and surprising causes of dust, and causes of ill health, but Holmes' comprehensive treatment also, necessarily, touches on the well known, amplifying with statistics and so on that just aren't that interesting."
5,Mind Stretcher,This book should be required reading. The world is nothing as most of us are taught it. The interconnectedness of everything needs to be realized. This book is one of those that carry this realization.
5,Worked great Price right,I tried to buy these rods at ford and they wanted 80.00.These after market rods have better grommits and were way cheaper.
4,"Beautiful, but not true to picture","I received this watch very promptly, and it is beautiful. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the face is not as pink as it is in the picture. You have to hold the watch in just the right position for the face to look pink. Otherwise it just has a pearl sheen to it. So, if you are looking for something with a true pink face, this may not be for you. However, it is a very nice watch."
4,Nice for the Price,Saw the exact same watch in several jewelry case around town for $125 more. Very satisfied with my purchase!
3,Nice watch.,I bought this for my wife. It is a nice looking watch but in real life it is nowhere near as pink as the picture. Unless you look close it is hard to tell it is pink at all. Also the diamonds are so small the wearer is the only one that is ever going to be close enough to see them. There is no bling effect for others to notice. So overall unless you look at it real close it just looks like a plain silver watch with a white face. Pretty boring. I wish it looked more like the picture.
5,Sophisticated watch,This watch is not as pink as the in picture which in my opinion is a plus. It is much more subtle and changes depending on how the light is shining on it. I don't understand why people complain about the diamond size... If you want bigger diamonds go and spend the money for them!
1,"Bloody, gory, bad.","Hmm. This movie is perfect for those who like to see graphicviolence and mediocre effects, but personally I prefer movies thathave less in the way of twitching limbs and screams as you hear each slice of the knife in lieu of suspense and excitement. I worried more about how gross the next death would be rather than how the characters would fare. Personally I hoped they would all die."
2,this movie was a joke,"i wanted this dvd because i wanted to be scared and i like the ideas of haunted house, honestly this movie was a joke yes it had a story but effects were terrible there was nothing scary about it you could tell that all the bodys and heads and arms that were being hacked off were fake. i wish i could get my money back id rather go with psyco , motherday,the omen amityvill horroe the excorist"
1,House on Haunted Hill,"Amazon must add one more rating category: the ""black hole,"" which would be reserved for pictures like this one, which are so poorly done that they rank in minus values. The screen play is rank; any first year drama student could do better. Rather than use the English language to convey emotion, mood, and (even a hint of) intelligence or wit, the writer simply loaded the dialog with the foulest of four letter expletives. The only funny part of the DVD is contained in the interview with the director in which he describes one of the actresses as the typical ""girl next door."" He must live next to a bordello! Not one of the actors in this film did a creditable job (it's hard to put your heart into vulgar inanity) Special effects are fair; audio and video are very good, but I give this one a ""BLACK HOLE."""
1,So Bad It's Funny!,"Billonaire Steven Price (Geoffrey Rush) arranges a party at the abandoned Vannacutt Psychiatrist Institute for the Criminally Insane (in short, House on Haunted Hill). The Institute was once the site of the most horrifying medical experiences in history. Price announces that anyone who manages to spend an entire night in the house will win $1,000,000! He has secretly rigged the house with insidious devices designed to scare the guests out of staying, but his tricks soon become meaningless, as thr mansion begins to generate terror on its own. Before their night of terror is over, the desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane asylum.House on Haunted Hill is a forgettable movie with laughable performances and a flippin' terrible script. It is equally terrible with The Haunting, 1999's other so-bad-it's-funny try-hard 1999 horror."
2,"Poorly written, poorly edited","Although I did learn a lot about Millard Filmore from this book, I think the presentation was flawed. It contains many errors, repetitions, and examples of bad editing. The author is one of those few people (mostly from the south) who insist that the Civil War wasn't about slavery and he brings this up several times. This detracts from his credibility. Though it was written quite recently, it reads as if it was written in the late 19th or early 20th century."
3,It's not so bad!!,"Alvaro Siza is probably the best architect in the world. It's true that the book is not even an introduction, but it has some major works, so, if you can buy another book about Siza Vieira, do it!!!!! If you can't afford it, buy this one, keeping in mind that Siza is much more..."
1,pitiful,"I love classic BOC and 'Astronomy' is my favorite song by them. It might even be one of my favorite songs by anyone.I hadn't heard of this album before and so, after reading some reviews and noticing that it featured a reworking of 'Astronomy', I spent the cash on a used copy.Simply put, it sucks. There are NO good songs on the album.They took the epic buildup of 'Astronomy' and turned it some kind of soulless, cheezy 80s power ballad / football chant thing.If you thought 'Club Ninja' sucked, you'll really hate this.When I saw that Satriani was on this, I should have known better..Pitifully, embarrasingly, BAD!"
4,different,"On this album they had guests Satriani&Robbie Krieger on it,so its different sounding in spots[not standard cult playing and or structure]but has some really good music on it"
5,Pure Ear Candy,I too bought the tape when it first came out and WORE IT OUT. I just paid a lot for the CD (used) and it was worth every bit of it. How exciting to be listening to this album again. Love it.
3,Not their best work but worth a listen.,"Imaginos has a strange hold on the hearts and minds of younger BOC fans. Maybe it is because it was their last effort for over a decade until the recent release of Heaven Forbid. As a life-long BOC fan, I found the album clumsy in trying to piece together the mysterious undercurrent that exists through most of their work. The album lacks the polish of their commercially successful years and adds a grunginess unlike their heavy metal origins. The remakes of Astronomy and Subhuman are very listenable but pale in comparison to the originals. The debate rages on as to which are better. This is by no means their worst album and well worth listening to."
1,I can still taste the vomit in my mouth,"At 51 I am a long time BOC fan, but had never bought Imaginos...until the other day when it arrived from Amazon. Listening to it was like fingernails on a chalkboard, I thought that when I got to Astronomy I would get relief...no dice, the version is horrible. The came Blue Oyster Cult. Oh my! If I was 13 I could probably like it. Come on guys! You can do better than this. I had to get out On Your Feet or On Your Knees to purge the horrid sounds from my skull, but alas I can still taste the vomit in my mouth. 3 thumbs down....Paulos"
4,A very good concept album,"Despite the rather convoluted conditions that this CD wasproduced under, it holds together remarkably well. It is a fairlyheavy album with the expected dark lyrics and themes that I've always associated with BOC. The playing and production are both very tight. Defintely a good buy - probably BOC's best work apart from their first three albums..."
5,A True Classic,What else can I say. The albumn is prefect! A Cult Classic (as is almost every one of their albumns). Nobody plays this style of music better. Excellent!
3,"Nice, solid BOC effort","Imaginos is a worthy purchase for any BOC fan. The album presents you with some nice, refreshing remakes of classic Cult fare, some enjoyable new tunes, and even an adventurous work in Siege and Investiture that breaks new ground, bordering, at times, on prog rock.Make no mistake, though, this album is not a classic in the vein of Secret Treaties, Agents of Fortune, or Fire of Unknown Origen. All of the songs are quality, but none but the remakes are deeply memorable (in that way Imaginos even falls a bit short of, say, Spectres). The heavy use of studio musicians at times provides a different sound in a refreshing way, but it gives a few songs a bit too much 'generic 80's tune' aura.I listen to Imaginos on many occasions and enjoy it, but it gets fewer hits in my Blue Oyster Cult library than, I'd say, 5-7 other Cult albums."
4,A cult favorite...for some strange reason,"Putting all the weirdness of the underlying story aside as well as the history of its creation and rumors proclaiming this album to be a lost jewel of BOC, this is a pretty good record that reminds me somewhat of their early years. What is surprising here is that there is not one obviously weak song on the record. Granted some of them are perhaps redundant.""Del Rio's Song"" seems to be taken from some completely different album. Despite that, ""I Am The One..."" is kicking ass, ""Astronomy"" is slightly redone but still great, ""Blue Oyster Cult"" being a version of ""Subhuman"" suits me even better than the original, and title track isn't half bad either. This is pretty heavy album (as always though I should mention that there is no metal here in the sense of Metallica, Bathory or Sepultura; this is just hard rock in its classic form as performed by the forefathers in 1969 thru 1974). Definitely worth having."
5,"Photoshop Elements 4.0, Maximum Performance","Of all the tutorial manuals I have on Photoshop Elements I think this one is the best. While not exactly at a beginner level, it can still be of value to a novice. The great thing is that it pretty much avoids the 'first face the stove' approach that most all books of this nature feel required to do. The lessons on color correction and turning a color photo into black and white are particularly great!"
4,Stop back pain now,"I find the DVD very helpful. My only complaint is that in thelast section where the lady guides you through a type ofmeditation, all you get are a few pictures of beautiful flowers,but her voice is so unclear that I do not you understand herand therefore miss the whole point of this section.Too bad,Blanka"
2,Video Not for Everyone,"I bought this video after rupturing a disc in my lower back. I was unable to do any of the exercises, as they caused me further discomfort. I would not recommend this video to anyone who has moderate to severe back pain because the exercises are too advanced for a person in this condition. However, if you are almost recovered from a back problem, or are only experiencing mild back pain, this video will teach you exercises to help improve your muscle strength. It also offers some very simplistic ""how-to's"" for daily activities such as bending, loading the dishwasher, etc., in a way that will not reinjure your back. These tips are really common sense ideas that will not greatly benefit anyone who is already living with back pain. Finally, I was disappointed by the video quality--it looks as if it were filmed by a low-end home video camera."
2,Be careful if you have had surgery,"I bought this DVD based on the review from the person who claimed to have had miracles after 5 back surgeries and being in traction. My word .. if that does not inpsire you, what would? Sadly, I followed the recommendations to do the exercises daily for 4 - 6 weeks, and two weeks into it, the numbness in my leg that had resulted from a herniated disk and botched physiotherapy has gotten really bad. Clearly, something I did in the exercise routine has exacerbated it. I would be very careful especially if you have had surgery or a herniation. This DVD may be good for people who are sedentary but generally healthy and want to strengthen their abs."
2,"Not enough material, translated from Jap. and reads like it","I was hoping to get great inside stories about development of miata from the Program Project Manager and his team members in this book. What i got is a bad read, very skimpy, often repetitive (same info is given by many members in thier respective chapters). This book is a joke, the contributors needs to be interviewed by a decent writer who then should write a book with proper flow .... and in English. The book is translated from Japanese and got goofy English translations at places. Not worth the price.The Plus points includes ""mentions"" (i can't use the word ""details"") of the thought and goals behind creating various components like the soft top, bumper, backbone, Power Plant Frame, body etc. as well as photos of early prototypes (clay models) and speciality miatas (Created by M2 division)"
4,An Overview of Fascist Romania,"This is a great book if one is already familiar with fascism in Romania during the interwar period. A plethora of information and names lends to the intensity of the read but is an excellent resource for further research. Ioanid systematically explains fascism as it pertained to Romania and as it was influenced by the socio-economic conditions, mysticism, nationalism,and the anti-communist movement. The book also discusses anti-semitism as a component of Fascist Romania and its effects on the jewish and gypsie communities."
2,Did nothing for my hair...,"I've purchased KMS in the past, specifically their straightening serum so I was excited to try this moist repair conditioner. My hair is normally curly/wavy in the winter and frizzy in the summer. My hair dries out a bit in the winter so I've been trying many different products in order to help my hair. This product did nothing, literally no change what so ever to my hair after using this which is pretty upsetting considering the price. So if your looking for something to help you with your dry curly hair, dont bother buying this product. As I said before I've tried other products by KMS which I love, but just not this one."
2,Not the best,"This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, but once my hair is fully dried it's still frizzy."
1,Does Not Fit '87 Buick Regal Grand National,"This item does not fit my 1987 Buick Regal Grand National as advertised. The shaft of my stock original oil pump driving gear is too large to fit in the timing cover hole. My oil pump gears are also slightly too large for this cover. I know that my oil pump gears are original, as I am the original owner of the car."
3,A solid B movie,"A solid B movie. It's worth watching for the beautiful cinematography; plus, Central America and South America is gorgeous and stunning.Conner dumps his wife-to-be after he discovers a particular truth about her. He decides to head down to Central America to forget her and several weeks later he meets up with a married couple who are seeking to smash the world record in crossing the Darien (over 125 miles of impassable jungle separating Panama and Colombia). Naturally, Conner decides to join the trek. It is an adventure story, a love story, but mostly a coming of age story and discovering what happiness and contentment requires. It has humor and tenderness but can be a bit trite. You will have to suspend your belief during some parts of the story but overall, not a bad two hours of your time if you like travel stories."
2,"Un-believable acting, great scenery, terrible song","I like all the scenery in the movie. Who brings one vehicle into the jungle on an expedition? Always travel in pairs. The ""star"" Christopher Kennedy Masterson reminds me of a clone of Neal Patrick Harris. I couldn't believe one minute of his acting. Then the horrible song happened. ""Rainbows have nothing to hide. The rainbow connection: The Lovers the dreamers and me"" The song was sung horribly and suggests something other than what the scene represents. I'll leave that thought up to your own. Made me cringe! Someone had good intentions I'll give you that much. I was extremely bored when I watched and it's not worth your time unless you are bored too."
1,"Poorly written, acted, and directed. A FLOP!","I hate to be negative, but after spending nearly five bucks to rent this stinker, I need to vent. Can people actually make such movies, that is, can they get the money to WASTE? Obviously yes, but what a joke...on us, the viewers. My husband and I thought this would be a film of a young person's awakenings, to the wider world, the humanity of us all, etc. What we saw was an infantile, aimless, and ultimately waste of time. Oh my God, the dialogue is so ridiculous, like maybe a teenager wrote it! The sad thing is this could have been done with perhaps a Werner Herzog bent, you know, some reality, some humanity. Save your money. Read Roger Ebert or good critics before you throw money to the scammers."
3,Could've been better,"Not 4stars because I expected more from its synopsis. As a movie of personal and travel discovery, I hoped the character would share more philosophies of life, as well as more scenery. I also didnt expect most of the movie to take place in the jungle. There were scarce scenes of the Americas' beautiful landscape, and I assumed his travels would show many more worldly sights. Nonetheless, it's relaxing, enjoyable; the actors are quite authentic and the ending is a clever one."
3,scary as hell... hey I was 6 yr old!,"I remember ""demanding"" we see this at the drive-in some 25-26 yrs ago. Well, the parents should not have given in so easily... I was scared to death... To this day, I would say this is one of the scariest movies I've seen. I was scarred. Nowadays kids aren't afraid of anything, let alone a mannequin coming back to life or the chopped up body parts of a woman ""crawling"" out of the freezer to seek revenge on her ax-wielding, cheating husband. Watch with the lights on and put a lock on the freezer..."
5,Awesome,"I have never used a product like this before; while it did hurt when I first used it, it works better than waxing. I did not see any hair growth for about 3 weeks after I used the Epilady and it only took about two or three passes to get all of the hair removed."
3,New version of the Original,"It's okay, but it's not as effective as the original Epilady. It doesn't pull as vigorously, and I have to work to get my legs as smooth as I would like. However, it sure beats shaving!"
3,motor causing burning smell,Has anyone had the motor smell like its burning during use? I just bought this and have used it just twice and the last time it smelled like it was burning...
3,just a okay epilady,This epilady worked okay for a little while and now it seems that it just doesn't pull the hairs out of my legs anymore. It is like the little blades need sharpening.
3,middle of the road,"Used this for about a month. It took a long time to get a good shave. It did, of course, last longer. Lots of ingrowns afterwards."
5,Excellent Product,"I am a virgin epilator user who just popped my cherry and I love this product ! I was skeptical at first. I only thought it was painful the first 1-3 times. I've been using it for about a month. I use it every 3 days right now. And as of right now, I'm way past getting rid of coarse hair. The fine hair that took it's place is not painful at all and my legs are now really smooth after using it. I really really love it and love getting rid of my razor too. I do legs and armpits, not brave enough for bikini area quite yet. To my surprise the armpits did not hurt like i thought it would. Around the knee's was worse. Bottom line, if you can tolerate the pain for the first couple of uses, you will be trilled with the results. I know I am."
1,Horrible!!!,"This is the worst hair removing system ever!! It pinches your skin horribly and does not remove the hairs. You have to continue going over and over the same hairs and for sensitive areas ( armpits, bikini) it is far too painful to even use. Save your money."
3,Too complicated,Maybe I'm doing it wrong but it takes forever to get the hairs. I don't feel the pulling that everyone else is experiencing and will not purchase this product again.
3,not an improvement,"I used to own one of those old epilady's in the early 1990's. It worked so much better than this one. This product does remove the hair but you have to go over and over the same area. It does have one improvement, it doesn't hurt when the hair is pulled out. It's advertised to remove even very small hair but I haven't' experienced this at all. I bought this so I could stop shaving but I don't think I will throw out my razors' yet."
3,Good enough,"I found that sometimes I need to go over the same area more than once. Other than that, I got a great value and performance so far has been what I expected."
2,Painful but efficient,"While this product gets the job done, it is much too painful to use on a large area."
3,Not the best one around,"I bought the Epilady a while ago. Its works fine but not the best one around... You will need to work slow to get the best results. It is not very poweful and it was a bit of disappointment for me.I still use it, but only when i know that i have enough time, not when in a rush..."
5,love this thing!!,"I had one of the early epilady products in the 1990s.This is totally different. WaaaaaY better and less painful than waxing. Easy for touchups. And for stubborn hairs, just stretch the skin and come at it from several angles. The epilady head is comfortable and helps you get the perfect angle."
2,Epilady Legend,"After using the epiladay legend for a couple of times, two of the blades fell out of place. It was completely unusable since the blades were scraping against my skin. I returned it to amazon just in time for a refund. I would not recommend it but could be that by chance the one I got was defective."
4,Its good product,This product is good. I brought this product last month and used it 2 times. It does its job well. Pain is less. But sometimes I feel that it didn't pull the hair from skin but it just shaved.
2,not statisfied,I owned a old style coil epilady and I was told that old style is no longer available and this one replace and works as good as my old one....NOT TRUE.... I have to use this every other day and my old one I used every two weeks I wish this information would have been their while I was buying I would have looked for something different.
4,Works like it says,I've been waxing for 2 years and at $70 a pop I thought I'd give the epilady a try. It works well. It does hurt a bit but you get used to it. It also breaks a few hairs here and there but over all no complaints.
5,I love my Legend!,"I bought an Epilady Legend rechargeable epilator when my old Epilady finally died - after 17 years!I really like this epilator. It is faster and smoother than my old one, and it never pinches my skin, even not behind the knees. I use it all over - legs, arms, underarms and even some in the bikini.I tried some other epilators by other manufacturers that my friends bought, but none of them do as good a job for me as the Legend. The fact that it is rechargeable help a lot. I can use it corded too, when I forget to charge it. this epilator is great for travel too. When I charge it full (overnight), it has more than enough power to finish epilating my whole body, so I never have to lug around my charger when I go on vacation.I would highly recommend the Legend, and in fact, some of my friends who epilate got one to replace the ones they had. Thanks Epilady!"
4,Does exactly what it should,"I really like this product, but I don't always have the time, and the pain can be a little much. Kind of sucks, but I think I will stay to waxing and shaving."
5,Good Buy,"This is my first epilator, honestly, i was kind of scared. Like any epilator, it makes a horrible noise but if you are truly afraid of the noise, put on some good earphones (I did). This epilator works well removing hair on legs and underarm. Two speeds were convenient, though I rarely use the slower speed. The first time is always the hardest but you just have to do it and get it over with. After that, the pain will become more bearable. The rechargeable component of the epilator is quite handy, when i am in a hurry, i can just whip it out with the wires and fuss. I love this product, epilating is so much better than constantly shaving!"
3,Miss the old one,"I owned the old Epilady spiral model and it lasted for almost 20 years! I loved it, the only reason I bought this new one is because the other one died.This new Legend, although does not hurt as much when hairs are being pulled, it does feel uncomfortable against the skin. After I used for the second time, my skin was covered in red bumps and some were actually bleeding (nothing serious!). Next day my skin was okay. Of course I am going to keep it as I already spent money on it but I am very disappointed."
2,Epilady Legend Epilator,Not to happy with this. I sent it back. Didn't pull the hair out like I thought it should. Left quite a few hairs behind.
2,Meh.,"This listing describes an epilator with 40 tweezer discs. The one I received had only 20. Amazon compensated me for the return shipping, and gave me an immediate refund. I'm not sure if the wrong-product issue was a fluke that happened only to me, or if the product description was just plain wrong.This epilator itself is...okay. Not great. I had to run over some areas of my legs quite a few times. I ended up purchasing a different epilator - the Braun 5270 Silk-épil X'elle Body System Epilator. That one's fantastic, and causes much less irritation.Bottom line: it works, but there are better products on the market."
4,Works Great!,"Don't give up, it can be a little uncomfortable at first but gets easier. The first time I used it it didn't last the 4 weeks it claimed to, not even 2. I've used it a 2nd time and it's been a week and my legs are still smooth."
3,Good if noise really bothers you.,"I bought this only because it was the only epilator that reviewers mentioned as being quite a bit quieter. It is less noisy than my previous braun silk epil. I wouldn't say it's quiet, but it's less likely to make my ears ring. On the lower setting I could watch tv with it on. Noise is subjective so YMMV. I have tinnitus so every decibel matters to me.It doesn't seem to work as well as the braun with regards to hair removal though.If anyone knows of a truly quiet epilator please let me know in the comments area!"
3,average,Product is good. I was expecting something which would support worlwide voltage (22-110) but this thing unfortunately only supports 110
5,Wait not more... get it...,"The best... I have been waxing for over 30 years... and would not change from waxing for nothing... i could remember the first electric epilator my mother bought and I still have PTSD from it... this one is a far cry from what I could remember... fast, no pain, no noise... it is GREAT... my only regret is that i have not purchased it before!!!"
5,Amazing - A cut above other epilators,"This Epilady performs all the actions of my older model - clean hair removal that stays hairless for longer than a shave or wax - but without the painful and annoying ingrown hairs. With my old model my calves would be covered in red dots that would soon become scars, so I had to stop using it. This Epilady avoids those ingrown hairs. It is painful the first few times, but no more than any other epilator hair remover, and the pain begins to fade after continued use."
2,My experience with Epilady was a flop.,"I purchased this epilator after reading extensive top-rated reviews and was really excited to try this out.My now dead Braun epilator had me covered for the past few years, and the hype about all the tweezer heads and two-speeds (my dinosaur of a Braun only had one) had me rushing to take a bath in order to soften the skin, hair, and open up the pores on my legs. I hoped out and was ready to be amazed!....I spent over 15 minutes on a 3"" by 4"" area and it STILL had not removed 50% of the hairs on my leg. I tried it on my arms as well, and was just as disappointed. Stay away from the underarm area, there is no cap attachment and the head is so wide you end up getting a lot of pinched skin and a pink face to go with it.Obviously this product had worked for many others, but it just isn't worth it for me. I would much rather spend an extra $40 and buy a Braun. Luckily, the customer service people at Epilady are AMAZING and gave me a partial refund."
3,It's OK,"well, it's OK. Could use more power, but my last epilator was the best (a Phillips I bought in Germany)."
2,Pulling hairs,"Compared to another hair pulling device I have used, that employs twisting coils, this epilator doesn't really ""cut it"". Pretty disappointed, since my old coil device is about 15 years old,and I expected this newer and improved version to be more effective."
3,Happy with results,I was disappointed that I could not find the old style Epilady so I took a chance and ordered this model. I am very happy with the results plus it is so much lighter.I does a good job of removing the hair even though I need to go over areas a few times. But that was the case with the old coil model too.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this new Epilator to replace the old Epilady coil hair remover. However, it was disappointing. Not as efficient as coil."
4,Pleased with product,"I have only used it twice on my legs. The 1st time I tried it my leg hair was very long (I know, TMI)so it hurt quite a bit. So far I like it a lot. It takes some time, but it's better than spending a ton on waxing every month or so (which is why my hair was so long, I rarely wax due to the co$t). I also use it on my hands/fingers & on my chin/upper lip. Easier/faster than plucking!! The upper lip hurts heinously, but that's to be expected.I would recomend this if you have the time it takes to use & you can take a little pain. I agree with another reviewer that it hurts less the more often you use it.Hope my review is helpful to some of you~"
3,third time around,i have used two epilady epilators before this one and both worked better though one was a much older model. the epilator is really painless but it dosent pull out all the hair and it cuts some hair so it grows right back. its also very slow. i got alot of ingrown hairs from it though exfoliating every day does help. the good thing is it works corded and cordless and the shape is very easy to hold. it can be seperated into a few pieces so its farily easy to clean with the brush. in teh end i am returning it becuase it really dosent work efficiently enough
4,Clear up most hair except the very short ones. Minimal pain in the bikini area.,This version of Epilady works great. It clears up most of the hairs except the very short ones and with just minimal pain in the bikini area. For other areas - no pain at all. Less hair for the later times.
5,Where Have You Been All My Life?,"I love this little device! Sure it hurt at first but after a few times you use it, it gets less and less painful. I suppose this is because there are less hairs to yank out.The first time that I used it I had a lot of irritation, red bumps and even small welts. After about 24 hours it all went away. Then I waited a week or so to let the remaining hair grow out a bit so I could get back to work. It wasn't nearly as painful as the first time. I waited another week...and so on.I am happy to say that although I am not completely hairless I believe there to be about 80% less hair on my legs now! I will keep using this and there is no doubt that I will lose more hair. I use to shave every day in the shower and now I don't. It has saved me a lot of time as well as water!I only wish I would have found this sooner!"
2,"""Waterboy"" Left Me Wet",I bought this album b/c my young daughter wanted it. It had different versions of some of the songs and/or missing music from the movie. Suggest you listen to every track BEFORE you buy it. Am VERY unhappy.
5,Great movie revival :),"It's a great CD if you want to remember movie scenes, it's not like other soundtracks that have a bunch of songs that you can hardly remember from the movie. This one has mostly ALL the tunes and the quality is amazing. Must have if you are a Sandler fan..."
2,Good but,"Like the readers above. I was searching for Block Rocking Beats. It was a major part of the movie yet it was left out of the album. Funny how that worked out. While you are there, pick up the other songs off the album and have your own version.................."
4,The Waterboy CD is GREAT!!!,This soundtrack has a variaty of great rock and rollers of the past and the future.All tracks on this are wonderful!!You will like this soundtrack as much as the movie.
5,Big Head Todd and the Monsters- Boom Boom!,"I just watched Waterboy again recently, and noticed that Big Head Todd and the Monsters had a song in the movie. The song is ""Boom Boom"" by John Lee Hooker, but gosh do they sing it awesome!I can tell you that it's even better to hear in concert! In my opinion, they definitely make this soundtrack!"
5,Easy to follow patterns,"El Burns' patterns are always easy to follow and a good value. You will enjoy her concise instructions and finding that if you follow her patterns exactly, you will have great results. Her quilts make up quickly, so you have near-instant feedback---a beautiful finished quilt top in no time!"
1,They do not ship the Special Edition set!,"They do not have the special edition set! This is just the normal Ferris Wheel set, that does NOT come in a carrying case. This cames in a light cardboard box with the pieces loose inside the box. It is still a good set, and it does have all the pieces etc, but you are not ordering the special edition set."
4,"Fun, but VERY hard for a kid!","I bought this product for my father who has always wanted an Erector set as a kid. I knew he would love putting it together with my 8 year old son which he did, but it was frustrating for my dad as there were a few pieces missing. He ended up having to go to the store to buy the extra pieces to finally finish it. My father said there was no way a kid could put it together himself."
4,Erector set,"Product is as advertised but a vital part, one of the pulleys for the motor, was missing in the packaged parts, so currently I can't use the motor to power the wheel and thus it does not work as it is supposed to.However, I recently ordered the part on [...] and hopefully, I will get it soon."
3,Not as expected from an Erector Set,"This set is fun, although not what I typically expect from an Erector Set. The sides of the coaster do not line up properly, therefore causing the seats to not sit correctly and hit the sides when spinning. Also, the motor is NOT strong enough to spin the coaster on its own...I had to jump start it multiple times. I would have been more satisfied without the let down from the motor. Overall, this product only 3 stars from me, where as other Erector Sets have gotten 5 stars."
3,ok for low intensity,"I think if you don't use this with Rambo-like intensity, it will work for. The pictures do not match the text in the pamphlet that comes with. The text says to hold it one, but the picture shows something in few places. Video is a little more instructive, but I have yet to find the ""65 exercises"" this thing can do."
3,"Fun, floating , and educational.","These floating globes always draw lots of conversation and amazement. Very fun to watch. You can leave it floating without rotating or give it a little spin and it keeps rotating on it's own. It rotates a little fast for my liking though. The first one I received died after 3 weeks, but the replacement is working just fine. Gives a great example of controlled magnetic levitation."
4,"Where is ""Rock and Roll All Night""?","WARNING: This tape is only for the extreme KISS fan. This video was cool, but the concert videos they showed were kind of strange. This tape dosn't have ""Rock and Roll All Night"" and ""Shout it Out Loud"" on it. They do have ""Black Diomand"" and ""Shock Me"" though. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons show rare pictures of the band without makeup in the 1970's, concept ideas for the ""Destroyer"" album, and ""Saturday Night Live"" skits surronding KISS. One cool thing is they show the KISS Mego dolls commercial. ""KISS, thats the name... KISS, they really look insane... KISS, if rocks your game, it's KISS! This is KISS! Each sold sepretly... by Mego"", is kind of how it goes. Also commercials for ""Alive II"" and ""Rock and Roll Over"". Better than most of the KISS videos. (Excluding: ""KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park"", which is my favorite KISS movie)"
2,low budget all the way....,"9 matches...with intros by Dusty, the footage itself seems like a copy of a copy ...bootleg quality if that makes better sense? The intros by Dusty are the highlight...but ""The AMerican Dream"" 3 DVD set by WWE is just a million times better than this. I'd only recommend this for Dusty fanatics that need every bit of film ever made on Dusty. Even his championship match with Harly Race is a blurry washed out mess of video."
5,Very nice!,"Great quality, looks great in my kitchen - I use it for pots. Elegant but not overstated design."
3,A view of the 70s and VietNam from the heart,This is a touching story of the VietNam peace movement straight from the heart of a Mom. It is one side of the age old struggle between heart and head.
5,A Snapshot In Time,"This is a great book that depicts one person and one community's account during the Vietnam era yet at the same time is indicative of what our country was experiencing on a national level. From a historian point of view, this memoir serves as a wonderful example of a primary source reference for the Vietnam War."
2,Too noisy,"This ""guitar"" is simply a noise maker. There is no volume control. There is no off button. There are no strings. All kids have to do is hit one of four buttons to start loud, annoying music. It is unreliable. Sometimes the buttons start the music, sometimes they don't. Do not buy this toy."
1,Absolutely useless,All the material one would pay for here (two pages downloaded) is available for a few clicks on one's browser.Worthless.
4,"Okay for the price, but not for pros","I'm a guitar tech, apprentice of a luthier and I used to upgrade and troubleshot guitar electronics, pickups, etc. (often with active preamps).This DMM works okay for most of the job, however, sometimes I found it annoying that the reading is slow and unstable (I mean it takes time to show the stable reading though it was a resistance or constant voltage) and sometimes it wasn't accurate enough to check some small differences.For the price it's a great tool of hobby tinkerers but I decided to rather go for a Fluke 179."
