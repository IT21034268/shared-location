5,Getting Through It,"This was my Bible during chemotherapy. It answered all my questions, cleared up my misconceptions, and overall let me view my treatment as a positive, healing process. I ordered a new copy to donate to my local breast cancer group."
2,Little info for Radiation,"I bought this book expecting information for dealing with radiation. There was very little information on radiation at all. The book may be useful for Chemotherapy patients (which is why I give it two stars). It had no stars of value for me dealing with radiation. My doctor told me more. ""Cancer for dummies"" and ""just get me through this"" have more information."
1,"Nice Concept, Poor Quality","Great concept, especially being able to buy extra bottles. But mine completely died exactly one month to the day after I opened it."
2,Shake & Take was no good,"I bought this bottle blender after seeing an episode of the Doctors and they recommended it. I also do a lot of smothies so I thought this was the perfect size. I haven't had it that long (almost 4 mos)and it doesn't even want to turn on at all, it is true what I read in some of the reviews, the motor is too weak. It is a shame becasue I really liked it."
5,1 year and still going strong!,"I felt the need to write this review because I had read quite a few negative reviews claiming that the motor doesn't last long and my experience has been very different. I have had mine for over a year now, I use it almost daily and it is still working just fine. This thing is so much more convenient than using a traditional blender.I would recommend buying some extra bottles. They crack at the threads after a while."
1,"could not wait to start my diet shake,purchased everything i had to throw all my stuff out plugged it in and nothingy","bought all the things i needed to put in shake, and nothing....... i cant believe it didnt work and to top it off i had to waste my money to throw everything away!!!!!!"
1,Was great while it lasted!!,"I bought this unit after trying one out at my buddies house. He had just recently got one as a gift.Great concept! I ordered mine the same night. I used it 4 days a week for 3 weeks for post- workout protein shakes. Here I am 3 weeks later ,blender wont start, called my buddy, guess what? His crapped out also! I wouldn't recommend this product for the sole reason that it is not reliable, It's a great concept but worthless if I doesn't run...That's my take on it!!!!!!!!!"
1,too bad this doesn't work better,"The concept is great but the mechanics of the design are fatally flawed. I got one of these and it worked fine, and so I ordered a few as gifts. Most of them don't work, and the main problem is the way the bottle interacts with the base. This is made even worse by bad workmanship. The tabs pop out, the links don't connect, etc. It is very frustrating to have gifts fail to work. I ordered one for my daughter; it won't work at all; I ordered another, and its tabs jump off. This needs a technical re-design to be a reliable and satisfactory product to live up to the good idea."
1,Don't buy this!,"It deserves no stars, but the form forces one to choose at least one star. It does not deserve even one star. I bought this blender to use after workouts, and used it once with good result. The second time I used it, all the water poured out the bottom of the bottle and the blender! This was a total waste of money!"
1,"Used to be good, now made cheaply","Had one of these for almost two years and loved it! Then the motor burnt out. Thought ""no problem"", got a lot of use out of it. I will happily order another one. The replacement burned out after a few uses. So, I ordered another one. That one burned out after a few uses also. Tried one more, that one lasted a few weeks. We used to love this product. The only thing I can think of is they started using cheaper motors. I am now going to look for a replacement product. Shake 'n Take... let me know when you start making a quality product again and I'll come back."
2,"Great idea, but the motor is simply not strong enough","Got one for Christmas. Tried it on the 26th and thought it was a very novel idea; convenient, easy to use, easy to clean, etc. 8 days later the motor dies. What's up with that? No ice was used, only frozen banana mixed with juice - that's it, motor died! A better motor and the item would probably last years and I'd give it 5 stars. Not sure the company will even replace it now, but I'm not sure I really want them to either! I know it will just die again."
1,Broke first use,I got this for xmas a few years ago. I got it out tonight to use for the first time. I got to use it once and it worked pretty good. Then it just stopped. Motor must have burned up. I probably pulsed it for 10 or 15 seconds about 3 times and then it wouldn't work. I let it cool off...still dead. Don't buy it.
1,Bad Purchase,"The only reason this is getting one star is because when you can actually get it to lock it does work, however then you have to FIGHT to get it to unlock to clean. Blending takes about 60 sec. opening and closing close to 10 min. Very NOT user friendly. Would not purchase this product unless your a weight lifter. Going in the garbage."
2,Has the quality changed?,"I bought one of these blenders 4 or 5 years ago and it's awesome. I use it almost daily. The blades on my shaker bottles were starting to get a little dull, perhaps because I use the dishwasher as opposed to hand washing immediately after use. At either rate, I ordered some new shaker bottles from Amazon.com and was sent the blender instead. I decided to keep the blender and use my old one as a spare. That idea only lasted a single use because the new blender was incapable of blending the exact same ingredients I've used hundreds of times on the blender. And, the motor now smells of overheating. So, I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if the quality of the electic motors has been reduced since my first purchase. I hope not. I was planning on using this product for the rest of my life as it is a very convenient product."
3,can ice be place in the blender,i would like to buy a shake and take but is it strong enough to take ice since i live in a hot place
4,Nice,"This is a nice little no frills gadget. I use it more for iced coffees, blades not very strong. But I like it."
1,This product does NOT work.,"I ordered this product and though the delivery was very fast, right out of the box i tried it after giving it a quick wash, and nope, it would not work AT ALL. Im going to return it and should receive a full refund, however wish i didnt have to pay for the shipping costs. Please dont buy this product."
1,Shake 'n Take Smoothie Maker,"The product is a great idea but it is poorly constructed. The sports bottle lid allows liquid to drip out at the base of the spout, so I have avoided drinking from the spout. The motor still works on the blender, but I need to pour the contents into a glass or another portable container. The manual for the product says there is a one year limited warranty, but the cost of shipping and handling is about $12, almost half what I paid for the product. I do not recommend this product. Make your smoothies in a good blender and pour the contents into a well constructed portable beverage holder."
1,Motor didn't run... right out of the box!,"Imagine my surprise when after carefully putting all my hand-picked ingredients into the sports bottle, I pressed the button and... silence. I envy the folks that got two weeks out of the motor. Mine flopped from the get-go."
3,piranha,This movie is really boring. The only entertaining parts are when the piranhas attack. Don't buy it. Watch it online.
2,Drive-in horror show,"I purchased this dog on the basis of a positive review in Leonard Maltin's movie book. It was supposed to be a comedy, a rip-off of Jaws, and filled with sly shots at 1950s scare films. In fact, there is no comedy or satire at all; it's a horror flick for drive-in theaters. A topless woman in the first scene gets the ""R"" rating--before she's devoured by hungry fish. Lots of blood everywhere. Lots of screaming. It's almost enough to make a couple in a drive-in look up at the screen."
2,Film Review,"It's beyond imagination to think that any horror film dealing with piranhas could possibly be a good film. This film is right ""up there"" in old-fashion ""awfulness."" A low-budget ""thriller"" is pretty much a 'yawner,' and this film is probably one of the more disappointing horror films I've seen. If you want to experience awful, tacky cheap horror this is the film to see!"
3,Jaws Rip Off,Yeh I know we've all established that for godsake you don't need to see it to know that just look at the damn cover. I don't see why it's an 18 over here it's not that gory I've seen far worse. However for a cheap budget rip-off it was funny and somehow made success the special effects are crap but for that year I suppose they'll do but I've seen toys more lifelike.
5,movie is awsome cult classic,"i love this movie - it is a cult classic. it had a really good story - i know everyone now wold think it is cheese cause it is not all high tec and special effect - but movies back in the 70's and 80's had to have a real story cause they couldnt cover it up with fancy special effects - their stories were origional - i lvoe this move and if you love old cult classics like orca the killer wale - , jaws then you will love this.. enjoy"
4,This is a hard to find DVD since they have stop selling this!,I've got to admit it that this is a great DVD collection. Not to mention a good movie! But i also got to admit that it is not better than JAWS the movie! I've seen this movie before on TV a long time ago. And now i finally got it on DVD! Thanks Amazon!De'Vear K. Smalls
4,Good,"These worked pretty well for what they are. However, they aren't quite as good as the original. I bought these cause I thought they were a good value for the money & use I got out of them."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,You can't beat the price for these Filters!! It was shipped very quickly and product details were spot on. I would recommend this product to anyone.
2,Got moldy!,I used the filter in my granddaughter's room and when I used it for the second time (not a long time between uses) the filter was dark and moldy. I had to throw it away.
4,"Good filter, does what it says it will do","This filter is better than what my humidifier came with in the box. Holds it shape very well and allows good air through-put. Doesn't last very long, maybe 30 days before it has to be replaced. That may be normal. I'll buy this product again, though."
1,Replacement Filters,"I had my 1st, 2 of these Filters fall apart within 2 uses each. This lot of filters are bad. This doesn't reflect the Seller's part. The filters arrived on time and were packed well."
2,Poor Quality,"These filters are not nearly as durable as the original filter that is provided when you purchase the relion humidifier.Price is good, but it's the old saying you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and buy the name brand filters."
4,Humidifier Filters Arrived But Have Not Used Them Yet,"filters arrived in a timely manner and appear to be the correct filter for the humidifier. but since i won't be using them until the winter, i do not know how they will preform"
3,Hoped for stronger filter...,Thought that these filters would be stronger than what was received. Once wet the filter caved inside the humidifier even with the reinforcement layer inside. It's does job that is the only reason why I gave them three stars. Would not purchase this product again.
3,not the best,not just the filters i dont think i will be keeping this type of humidifier. there seems to be a build up of residue inside quite quick and the material of the finters falls apart ewasy making cleaning hard and not worth it we will ask our dr about a better recomendation.
2,Poor Quality.... Stinks in days..,This is of poor quality. It worked only for 2 weeks. It started stinking and noticed mold formation. Even after I changed the water multiple times.
3,weird product.,"I am not sure the manufacturer of this product since there was no information on its product. it fits in my humidifier, but the quality of the filter looks much cheaper than the original one I replaced. Overall, it is a cheap substitute that works."
3,Beats having to drive to Wal-Mart,"Product arrived quickly and it was better priced than anywhere else around town. My only complaint would be that for such a small box of filters, the packaging was a little excessive, it could've fit in a Flat Rate box from the Post Office."
2,Not Good,"They only last maybe a week. If you dont change weekly, it doesnt humidify the water. I wouldnt know an alternative."
3,Surprised,"When I found the filter on Amazon.. immediately I whip my CC out and happy to pay bc its such a great deal. The product arrived in a timely matter, 5-7 days (forgot exactly how many days the shipping was but definitely not over a week). Ship package comes in a small brown box and filter neatly wrapped in a clear plastic bag. The reason I gave it 3 stars bc of the product itself. Not a quality type filter that comes with a metal back support, meaning filter shrink down when in use. The size fits and the white color looks clean.."
1,filters,wasn't what i ordered i gave the model number but the filters were for another model smaller filters had to discarde them
3,"I expected more since it was the ""trilogy"".","While the book kept me turning the pages, I must say I was slightly disappointed with the story. When you get used to E.Lynn and his ""flavor"" I just didn't quite taste it this time around. I did love the character Basil and thought his visits to his ""shrink"" was extremely wild! You have to love to hate him! Besides Basil, I did enjoy the very last chapter and I won't say who's talking but you reader will have an ending treat!"
3,Nice reading about the old characters again,"It was nice reading about the old characters again, but most of the story was predictable. Abide With Me has several good parts, but I think Harris' previous novel was much better."
3,It is a fair book to Read,"I have to admit that as an advent book reader and as a straight african-american male, I was at first hesitant to read Mr. Harris's book. My wife insisted that his books were terrific, so I started by reading ""And This Too shall pass"" and then ""If This World Was Mine"". Only later did I read ""Invisible Life"" and Just As I Am"". I have enjoyed his books and they have taught me alot about my homophobic outlook on life. When I learned that ""Abide With Me"" was coming out I rushed to the book store to buy it. After reading into it I was somewhat lost and very angry with the characters and the storyline. I felt like maybe he had left us out in the cold when he was writing this book. I mean overall I did read the entire book within a couple of days, but not even the intriguing end could make me want to read this book again."
3,Not as good as the others,"Don't get me wrong. Abide With Me was a good read. Harris is a talented writer whose works I enjoy immensely. However, this one just didn't hold my attention. Between Basil's anger-filled therapy sessions, Raymond's confirmation and relationship woes and Yancy's trecherous scheming, I found myself suffering from drama-overload. The novel ended on a sappy and completely implausible note with far too many questions left unanswered. When I finally finished Abide With Me, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed."
2,WHAT HAPPENED??,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF E. LYNN HARRIS SINCE HIS FIRST NOVEL. AT THAT TIME, HIS BOOKS WERE KIND OF UNKNOWN TO THE MAJORITY AND WERE CULT FAVORITES OF PROGRESIVE READERS. I KNEW WHEN I SAW A COPY OF ABIDE IN THE GROCERY STORE THAT HIS BOOKS HAD GONE MAINSTREAM AND THAT THINGS WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME; I WAS RIGHT. WHILE ALL OF HIS NOVELS ARE GOOD, FAST READS, I FOUND THAT THIS ONE IS LACKING IN DEPTH AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. THAT STORYLINE WITH YANCEY AND NICOLE WAS AN INSULT TO ANOYONE'S INTELLIGENCE. NICOLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SAVVY SISTER;WHEN DID SHE GET SO DUMB? TOO MANY LOOSE ENDS TO COUNT. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A SEQUEL IS PENDING HERE BUT THE ENDING WAS SOMETHING OUT OF TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL. WE ALL LOVED KYLE'S CHARACTER IN THE OTHER BOOKS BUT GIVE US A BREAK. THIS WAS NO WAY TO BRING HIM BACK TO US. MR. HARRIS, I LOVE YOUR WRITING BUT PLEASE DON'T COMPROMISE THAT TALENT JUST TO SELL BOOKS AT WALMART."
1,He's no James Baldwin,"I've read all of E. Lynn Harris' novels and each time I'm left wondering why. Abide With Me is so badly written that I find it hard to believe it was edited at all. As a matter of fact, his writing is so flawed that I was unable to get into the story. The subject matter is unbelievable and extreme; the characters are so one-dimensional they've become caricatures; and the only thing that I can give Mr. Harris credit for is the fact that he was able to dupe someone into publishing this. I would suggest a writing seminar for the author and request that he take a break before writing anything else."
3,Wishing for more!!,"I thought the book was pretty good, but for some reason I was looking for more. I guess I felt the book should have built more on Basil's doctor situation. Even though he made some progress, I believe we should have been able to realize more progress. I personally did not think Basil progressed enough. There were other situations that I believe should have been included in the book, such as, Nicole discovering that Ava was Yancey's mother, something in reference to Nicole and Jared finally getting a child some kind of way, etc. But overall the book was pretty decent and I can't wait until E. Lynn Harris writes another book. I hope the wait is not too long."
3,To know all characters--read If This World Were Mine 1st,"This was a good book; however, I find it to be a bit misleading. This book is introduced as the conclusion in the Invisible Life and Just As I Am series; however, its speaking of characters MONTY, YOLANDA, DWIGHT who were not in either one of those books but in his last book IF THIS WORLD WERE MINE. If a person were just jumping on the Harris Train then they would probably read this book after his first 2 books because its advertised as being the conclusion in that trilogy and would be totally lost and wondering who these other characters are. Other than that I like E Lynn Harris, and even though this is not as interesting as the first 2 books it was still interesting to see how more confused BASIL can be about his denial on his sexuality."
4,Good Story,"I've just completed 'Abide With Me' and found it to be pretty good. It wasn't as good as the previous two, but I still enjoyed it. I would love to see Basil overcome his childhood issues and get his personal life on track once and for all. BUT, I'd also like to know what's going on with Yolanda and Dwight from 'If This World were Mine,' and Caliph and Tamala from 'And This too Shall Pass.' Please, Mr. Harris. Don't let the curtain come down on these interesting characters. You've spoiled me! I look forward to your next work."
1,Good material for Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake!,"As I read Harris' lastest novel, I kept wondering why the world needs this work. It did not raise my intellectual temperature. The characters, as well as the writer, are so elitist...true buppies. I am not saying African-Americans do not lead these kind of successful lives, it was just that some of the elitism is hard to take.The book is quick reading, and has its interesting tales of the lifestyles of the well-off. Its gossipy stories would naturally make it hard to put down, only because the reader wants to see what happens to these brats.There were no interesting words flowing from Mr. Harris' pen. It is written at a 5th grade level, which I found interesting, given that the main characters are so well educated."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I am truly disappointed with Mr. Harris's current novel, Abide With Me. I yawned throughout the entire novel and felt I just could have read his previous novels again. There wasn't anything new or exciting in this book. I am truly disappointed. How I wish for a refund!"
4,Very good book,"I loved this book, it fell right in line with the others, He is just a great writer an I look forward to his next book. I love the suspense and the fact that he left me hanging just means that there is more on the way. Love you E. Lynn!"
4,Forget Whatcha Heard!,"E. Lynn forgive me for not writing sooner. I read this book when it first came out and I loved this book. It gave me closure but at the same time I had to wonder about the two shady characters that finally hooked up. They could still lead you to another book altogether. It felt good seeing the angel at the end, too. If this world was the same, life would be so boring. You got to take the good comments with the bad. So do not get discourage from the negative comments. It's all good and makes you an even stronger writer. So hurry up with the next book. This book still had me speeding to the end! I loved it!"
3,Not Satisfied,"After reading Just As I Am and Invisible Life, Abide With Me was a let down. I finished the book very disappointed, wanting more from the characters. The first two books were filled with drama, suspense and complications. In this book, however, each chapter was almost predictable. I saw no significant changes or growth in Raymond or Nicole, and the drama in their lives was kept to a minimum. On the other hand, getting to know Basil a little more was a treat. Also discovering that Yancy may probably find out in the near future that what goes around really comes around, was very enlightening. I can't help but think that perhaps E. Lynn may have rushed this novel more than his others."
3,Good not great,"It was nice reading about the old characters again, but most of the story was predictable and a little passe. Abide With Me has several good parts, but I think Harris' last novel was much better. Hopefully the next novel will be more up to par with what I've grown to expect"
3,Definitely not E. Lynn's best work!!,"I have read all of E. Lynn's books. Abide With Me is definitely not his best. However, it will be interesting to see where he goes with his next novel. I am sure the focus will be on Basil Henderson and Yancey Braxton. These two deserve each other. Ha!! Ha!!"
4,Good but not Mr. Harris' Best,"I read his current novel and although I finished the book, I just didn't feel the umph that I felt when I read the rest of his books. There were many questions left unanswered. I'm sure there will be a sequel and I'll buy it!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I have read all of E.Lynn Harris' books and find ""Abide With Me"" to be the worst. The ending was weak. It appeard to be a ""set-up"" for a new novel."
2,A Book Soap Opera,"I did not care too much for ELH latest, ""Abide with Me."" In fact, I did not even care for the title of the book. The characters were too predictable and very simple. It was, in essence, too much of a fantasy world Everybody is, as in all the other novels, upper class and well to do. News flash: the majority of people are not like that. Also, there's an element of prejudice with facial features of the main characters: Green or Grey eyes, and ""good hair?"" All in all, the novel is more like a book soap opera. Personally, I think ELH has taken tips from junk writer Jackie Collins to sell books to black audience. Oh, by the way, there is no way ELH could ever write like James Baldwin."
2,Abide with me,"Hated it. I love his other books but I found myself only reading the chapters with Nicole and Yancy's drama. I tried to stick the book out thinking it just started off slow but to no avail this is the most boring book I have incountered yet with E. Lynn Harris. If you are a strong fan of his, wait for the next book! :("
4,Another Fabulous Creation,"E. Lynn Harris has created yet again another fabulous creation. Abide With Me not only shows how important it is to have friends, but also shows that everyone is not perfect. From Raymond to Nicole, all the characters had their own flaws and learned how to deal with them. If you have problems and don't know how to deal with them, then this book will give you insight on how to deal with everyday life's problems. But the book was just great! Can't wait for the next one!"
5,Abide With Me,"I enjoyed this book as much as I did the others. I love the way E. Lynn writes about relationships. As I tell everyone, even if you don't like the idea of gay and bi-sexual people, they are a fact of life. I feel anyone who reads these books will have a better understanding of this lifestyle. I can't wait for his next book."
3,What's the purpose,"I've read Lynn's book Invisible life, which I thought it was very well written and I enjoy reading about the characters. Abide With Me didn't keep my interest. I found myself skipping pages. The one character I did enjoy reading about was Basil. Maybe it's just me but I didn't catch the message or the purpose of this book."
5,"Harris, books are in inspiration",I have read four of Harris' novels. Each novel helped me make difficult decisions in life. He helped me to realized that there are other people out there just like me. I've read other comments from customer like myself. One person stated that one novel was sloppy. I have to disagree with that person. I haven't read any sloppy novels by Harris. I wish E. Lynn Harris continued success in the future.
3,This novel was not as compassionate as the previous novels,"I thought that Harris has a great way of writing his novels which make them witty, high-spirited, along with a touch of emotional depth. However, his latest novel was a slight disappointment because it seemed a bit ""choppy"" and was the type of novel that appeared to be more of an ""introductory"" novel.... like it was his first time writing. (""There is Jane. See Jane run."") Compare this writing to his other novels and I'm sure you can note the difference. Also, if I may add, if the characater Basil Henderson appears in each and every novel that Harris has written, then why not just write a separate novel based just on this character? Obviously, he's interesting enough to be excluded in a separate, honest, and real story."
3,A Good Read,"E. Lynn Harris seems to grow with each novel. I enjoyed reminiscing about characters that were introduced in his previous novels. Although at the end it seems to be ""rushed"", I thought it was a good novel and would recommend it. I finished it during a long layover at the airport!"
3,Interesting...,"I really enjoy reading E. Lynn Harris' books, but this one was hard to keep me interested. The first book was the BOMB! but after that the excitement factor started to die out. I hope the next one is a little more thrilling. The ending was really weak and the characters are becoming sappy and unrealistic. We need some spice in the life."
2,A BIG DIS APPOINTMENT,"I FOUND THIS TO BE A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. I AM BIG FAN OF E.LYNN HARRIS AND I FOUND HIS BOOKS TO BE ENTERTAINING, INFORMATIVE, AND THOUGHT PROVOKING. HOWEVER, ABIDE WITH ME WAS A BIG BUST. I FELT THAT E. LYNN LEFT US HANGING. FOR INSTANCE WE NEVER KNOW WHAT REALLY GOES DOWN WITH TRENT AND RAYMOND. ALSO IS NICOLE AN AIRHEAD. I MEAN SHE NEVER REALLY CONFRONTS SHELBY FOR ALL THE ROTTEN THINGS SHE DOES. AND WE NEVER SEE SHELBY'S MOTHER CONFRONT NICOLE AT ALL. BASIL NEVER REALLY GET HIMSELF TOGETHER. HE STILL HAS ISSUES THAT HE WILL NOT REALLY FACE. HE NEVER ANSWERS THE QUESTION IF HE REALLY LOVES RAYMOND.(WHICH I REALLY THINK HE DOES) I FEEL THAT THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED MORE. NEVERTHELESS, I AM LOOKING FOWARD TO THE NEXT BOOK, BECAUSE I WILL ALWAYS BE A FAN OF E.LYNN'S."
2,Not his best,This book was lacking something. There were alot of times in the book where it dragged and I was tempted to put it down. I was simply disappointed with this book. I don't think that E Lynn put enough thought into this one and so far it has been his worse.
2,Mindless Drama,"While I have loved some of E. Lynn Harris' other books, this one didn't do it for me. While there were a lot of stories going on, the story line development had holes. There was lots of drama but it just didn't seem to go anywhere. Everyone (his mama, his man, his friend, etc) seemed to know what Raymond was thinking all of the time --- bad writing or is the brother that transparent. It read like a soap opera with really weak characters. Also, there were attempts in the book to bring some wisdom to the story...""listen to your heart..."". Borrow this one if you must read it."
3,What Happened here,"I fell in love with this author after ""Invisible Life' and ""Just as I am"". So you could imagine my eagerness to read this book.I WAS TOO DAMN EAGER. It started out explosive. All the character I love in the midst of trouble and my favorite character, Basil dealing with life...hmmmmThen... I don't know what happened, but the ending came and I felt as if pages were missing out of my edition, becasue nothing was explained..Raymond deserves the best...the Trent issue is not dealt with at all....and as for Nicole and Yancy..hmmmmMr. Harris can still write but i guess the pressure was on too much to come up with an ending.Still a good book though"
2,BORING......,"I read Harris's previous books & was disappointed by AbideWith Me. It started slowly & never really got interesting. Thedialogue seemed fake & contrived. The only thing that even mademe try to finish the book was Basil & the drama between Nicole andYancey. And after I read the entire book, I was left confused by theending ... I'm going to read And This Too Shall Pass next. I hopeit's much better."
4,ALMOST HAD ME!,"This latest novel by E. Lynn Harris was very good...but the ending had me longing for more. I wished it would have been a different type of ending but hey...what can you say...E Lynn is a genius when it comes to writing...and ""Abide With Me"" shows it. I can't wait for his next release...this book had me ""HOT"" with Basil and Raymond playing with fire. Oh well...buy it...you won't regret it. Maybe the next book will have a reunion with Basil and Raymond...even if it is in their dreams"
3,Cheated!!!,"I was totally disappointed and felt cheated! I must admit I expected more of gay love story with all the amenities of heterosexual pleasing but not a equal mixutre of both. I know everyone has their own view of what and how a novel should read. However, having read Harris' previous works, especially the two to which this was to complete a triology, left me in high expectation. I felt with Raymond being the main protagonist, the storyline should have been built around him not Nicole Springer. At one point I actually felt exasperated enough to stop reading but I held on hoping Basil would do something to pull me through (which he didn't). I am an E. Lynn Harris faithful fan and that is why I felt compelled to add my on little review. One other point, where in the world did Harris get the idea for that ending!?! It was definetly out of this world in more ways than one. I'm sure Martha would agree, ""it was not a good thing."""
3,"Fun, easy read but fairly predictable and not too deep",I enjoyed reading the book because the characters were fairly engaging and the plot somewhat interesting. The book however is not terribly complex and I didn't feel that I necessarily learned a lot from it because it was very predictable.
5,Excellent. Phenomenal follow up to the first four!,"This book is incredible. If you have read his first four books you will absolutely love this. He picks up and follows the lives of previous charachters Nicole, Raymond and Basil. He taps into their feelings with such ease. It seems like he has become a better writer. This book is moves quickly."
4,Really good ACTING as well as first-rate musicianship,"This performance is so absorbing, so convincing, and so satisfying that I will just mention the few flaws I saw: 1. Monte Pederson's voice often seems pinched to me, an understandable problem with the extremely shouty and difficult role of Pizarro. 2. Josef Protschka is much too fat to be Florestan visually. He 's supposed to have been living on two ounces of bread a day for many months, right? Normally I would not even mention this, but it's particularly irksome because virtually all other visual aspects of this performance are so convincing.Robert Lloyd deserves special credit for his supportive ensemble singing and for conveying the various facets of Rocco's personality--the cheerful father bouncing Marzelline on his knee, the cowering underling who refuses to kill, and the crippled taskmaster who keeps Leonore focused on her digging."
4,A Minor Work With Major Acting,"Clearly this film/play is by no means on the level of A Streetcar Named Desire, but I find it rather enjoyable. The dialogue is not well written and it's a bit over the top, and of course the film is very melodramatic. And it does tend to drag on and on, but, it is the superb acting of Anna Magnani and Marlon Brando that carry the film and keep my interest. Brando is as magnetic as ever, your eyes are always drawn to him--no matter who is in the scene with him--he gives a great performance considering the script. Despite their reported off-screen squabbles, Brando and Magnani have great chemistry and electrify the screen together. The cinematography is fabulous and adds to the mood of the film. Although it's not Tennessee's best, it's definitely a movie I'll watch time and time again."
2,Fear and Loathing in Hickville,A drifting petty criminal settles down in a small town working for a lonely and broken older woman while a young outcast party girl pursues him. There are so many similar scenes of smouldering seductive sparring that the movie seems like a parody of itself. Ultimately it's just a collection of unsatisfied sad sacks wallowing in their own misery and one of the silliest clumsiest endings ever.
3,another classic release through Criterion,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Fugitive Kind is a film based on the Tennesee Williams play. The film is directed by the acclaimed Sidney Lument. Marlon Brando leads the cast with very good acting and it remains a popular film to this dayThis is a two disc set and comes with some television adaptations of the Williams plays, Moony's Kid Never Cries, The Last of My Solid Gold Watches, and This Property is Condemned. Also included is an interview with Lument, and a special on the film."
3,Fugitive Kind,"I only purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister who is an Ana Magnani fan. As of yet, I have no feedback from her as to her critique of this film. I have not seen the film myself."
4,blu-ray?,"The performances are great, especially Brando's. The movie didn't get the acclaim it deserved. The same goes for his outstanding job in The Nightcomers. He was cheated and so were we! The new 4/27/10 release says HD. does this mean it's hi def? if so, way doesn't it say blu-ray? Will it play on a blu-ray player?"
3,"Melodramatic, strong acting, great B/W cinematography","Maltin is unfairly harsh toward this admittedly melodramatic Tennessee Williams opus. It features strong performances throughout, with Brando in fine form as the misunderstand, inarticulate but sensitive young rebel who arouses the passions of two women and the ire of a small town's authorities -- in a much more literature, less obviously commercial treatment than the more popular The Wild One. Sensitively directed by Sidney Lumet (Long Day's Journey Into Night), the film features rich, moody black & white cinematography which accents & underscores this typically Williamsian Southern-Gothic melodrama. Some movies don't have to ""go anywhere"" if the mood is sufficiently compelling and the acting, direction and cinematography as powerful as in this underrated classic."
3,"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","I'd love to see a decent DVD transfer of this wonderful Marlon Brando movie, cause this MGM disk ain't it! Poor quality, non-anamorphic 1.66:1 transfer just sits there in the middle of my new widescreen set with a fine, yellow line down the left edge of the picture. Hard to watch but still, somehow compelling. Joanne Woodward is great. Come on, studios! This is Brando here. How about some special editions of the great movies from one of the biggest superstars of world cinema? Surely there's a market for them..."
1,Worked for 5 weeks then died,Bought this used and so far it seems ok. It has a bit more scratches on the back than it was described but it seems to be working ok enough. Will update after a few weeks of use. I would recommend for those considering used or refurbished ones to try to purchase from a known retailer like Amazon so that if it doesnt work you can return it.Update: Gave as a gift for the holiday.. lasted 5 weeks and then died. So I wouldnt recommend buying used Ipod's. This is the second one I purchased and neither have lasted very long.
2,Ipod breakdown,"got this ipod and the same day the sad face came up and it stopped working. Maybe its just the fact that im not too familiar with ipod software, or that it was an older generation, either way within two weeks i was sending it away to get repaired. I reccommend getting a newer generation, its worth the money and you'll most likely have less problems."
4,iPod 40 GIG Photo,"I just bought a refurb iPod 40 gig photo with firewire from the Apple Store online. It was the best priced model that still works with Firewire. Since I do not own a computer with USB 2, I wanted to stay with Firewire. Regarding malfunctioning iPods, you have a one year hardware warranty. If you choose not to buy AppleCare for the extra year, that is unfortunate, and not Apple's problem, but the users. Guess what? Sony's MP3 players come with a 90 day warranty, and Sony has a reputation for good quality. Point being: not Apple's fault if unit breaks down after one year if you don't purchase extended warranty. All electronics are made in China anyway, so buy the extended warranty. More later after using the iPod for a while."
4,"Finally, its working fine","I had some serious difficulties getting the iPOD to collect my photos in the categories that I had designated in my Photoshop Album 2.0. Thanks to 2 kind people on the Adobe Forum web site, they directed me how to solve the synchronization problem. The key is placing all the photos that you want on your iPOD in ""COLLECTIONS"", the alternative method to ""TAGS"" for storing photos in categories. Once I moved all my photos from their ""tagged"" designations to ""Collections"", everything worked fine and I now love my iPOD Photo. For further help in storing photos in PSA 2.0, go to the Operating Manual for the PSA, pages 50 - 58, at ""c:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop Album 2.0\Shared_Assets\Locales\US_EN\Online Help.pdf"". Be aware that the iPOD will not synchronize photos from PSA 1.0 or PSA 2.0 SE (Starter Edition). If you have PSA 1.0, the 2.0 edition can be downloaded from the Adobe site for $29.00."
5,Perfect---With Minor Flaws,"This is an excellent machine. It's compatible with Windows, easy to install, quick to upload, and just generally great. You can check out all the other reviews here for the details on how good it is. The photo screen is nice, but I really didn't find it all that necessary.There are some minor problems that need to be taken care of when you purchase this:1) BUY A CASE- The case that comes with this is not very good because the screen can get scratched easily. This is necessary.2) BUY A WARRANTY- The internal battery will probably die within a year, so it's necessary to get a good warranty.3) CONVERT YOUR WMA FILES- The most annoying thing about this is that it doesn't take Windows Media files. Convert all of your WMA files to the ipod-compatible format. If you have protected files, re-upload them in the iTunes format.Enjoy your ipod!"
4,I love my new iPod Photo 40GB,"This is my first iPod... I had just ordered a 4G 40GB and the next day this was announced so I jumped. I've never been an early adopter before but I am very impressed. I'm a professional musician and I don't actually listen to much music on the go -- too much of a pain to switch CDs for that one song I want to hear over and over again. But the iPod is terrific and I have not been disconnected from it for five days. But the photos... well, I've been able to go to venues and show promotional photos for the bookers on demand so I can get their interest and that's been a big help and time saver. Also, being able to create a slideshow has been terrific. I agree the quality isn't ""print"" but I do think the photos are beautiful on that sweet screen. I do wish for lots of improvments but I'm still loving it."
1,Warning about the Ipod,"I have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006. I started to get an error that state that Itunes can't read to or write form the Disk meaning the Ipod itself. That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd. This was very upsetting to me as I have had this item for less than a year. I Finlay called tech support at Apple. They asked for the serial# for my Ipod. They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally. I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005. I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was not. So, this is a warning to all Ipod owners of this potential problem."
2,Beware Apple Quality,"Apple quality is terrible, and they don't stand behind their products. My iPod Photo started malfunctioning almost immediately after the warranty expired. I have spent more time resetting it and reloading it than listening to it. The battery gives no where near the advertised power. If you don't pay for an Apple Care policy for an extra year, Apple will not provide any service or refer to third party service for an iPod, even if you wish to pay for it.According to the Apple Store technician, the iPod's hard drive is defective, probably was from the staryt, resulting in intermittent crashes (sad iPod face in display), inability to power on or freezing of device. Another Apple technician told me he believed the logic board is bad. They suggested replacement of the device, which cost $499, at my cost as the one-year manufacturer's warranty expired nine months ago."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This is my second iPod. I had my first iPod for almost two years and loved it. It was definately one of the coolest devices I have ever had. I was really excited about an iPod with a color screen. First of all, I was not sure that I would like the new wheel, but after using it, I am pleased and do think it is an improvement. The real issue for me is that you can not really keep pictures on this device as Apple would have you think UNLESS YOU BUY ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE. For Apple users, you have to have have iPhoto 4.0.3 and for Windows users you have to have Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 or Elements 3.0. If you don't have these programs, you won't be seeing color pictures on your iPod. iTunes was and is included with an iPod purchase and i assumed that any software needed to view pictures with my iPod would also be included. This being the case, I would suggest you buy the black and white iPod and save $100 unless you already have the software needed."
2,Too expensive,"For $500(or $600 for the 60GB edition) you can get a computer. I think its a little to expensive for what you get. The battery life is better, which is a plus but other than that there is no significant improvement on the 4G iPod, except for the color screen/photo viewing which in my opinion is not worth 100 extra dollars. There are much better color screen and photo viewing mp3 player alternatives out there, at a much lower cost. Check out the Archos Gmini 400(can play videos also and its the same size as the iPod), iRiver iHP-320(bundled with FM Radio, In-line recording, voice recording), or Cowon iAudio M5(same as iRiver IHP-320 only smaller).[...]"
1,Horrible,"I'm not saying that the iPod sucks but I just hate the photo! I like the 20GB normal version of the iPod. I don't care about the color screen and that you can have a picture slideshow. You can get the same 40GB iPod that stills holds 10,000 songs for much less than this. I hate the expensive versions of the iPod because who the heck would use 10,000-15,000 songs? I might use 2,000 songs but that's it. That's why the iPod mini is horrible also. The 60GB is way out of a person's reach (moneywise)and the 40GB is just a waste of money because Apple makes the same gigabyte space for a cheaper price. We don't need color screens we just need a thing that plays music (nothing high-tech!)"
4,A warm and uplifting story about cross cultural adoption,"A tender account of a mother's adventurous journey into her daughter's world. The spirit of modern day China comes alive in these pages, and the remarkable account of how Emily Prager's young daughter Lulu takes to her original hometown and rediscovers her origins in a spirit of both serious searching and playfulness is very moving. She, in turn, is received with obvious delight by her original townsfolk. This tale demonstrates how much adopted children can thrive from understanding their background more clearly, and how much courage and heart it takes to give such an opportunity."
4,From someone planning a homeland tour,"The previous reviews show a wide range of reactions to this book. As someone who is about to take her 8 and 4 year old adopted daughters on a homeland tour that will include a brief stay in each of their home towns, I obviously see nothing wrong with taking a child Lulu's age back to China. I didn't agree with everything the author said and did, but the book gave me a lot to think about before we go on our trip. Many of the negative reviews were written in the days when homeland tours were fairly rare. Emily Prager was a pioneer! Many people have taken their adopted children back to China since then and I think we know by now that these trips are generally positive experiences for the children. There are a variety of opinions on the age at which children should return. I think that it really depends on the child and the financial resources of the parent (i.e., how often they can afford to go back)."
3,Would really like to give it 3.5 stars,"The book is well written and is fun to read. But as a parent in the process of adopting from China, and a reader with internationally adopted siblings, I agree with some of reviewers that the story tends to gloss over tough issues. Taking a 5-yr old child back to where they were is not a model for curing their problems."
2,"Puzzling, misleading and too cute","The premise of this book is troubling: the author takes her not-yet-five year old daughter to trace her Chinese roots. As a parent who has also adopted, I find the idea of taking a child on such a long ""roots"" journey to be questionable, considering the child's youth and the complexity of this particular journey (and, of course, it's expensive). What can such a young child understand and retain of this experience? And if this little girl is as confused and concerned about her roots as the mother says, doesn't such a trip prompt even more confusion? My sense is that Prager wanted to write another book and take a good trip and her daughter provided a lot of good material for one. The two really good things about the book - and that's why I give it two stars - is that 1) it's well written - Prager is good at that and 2) it lists some other good books for folks who have adopted or are thinking of adopting. But otherwise, this book gave me the creeps."
4,a wonderful story..................,"I loved this book not only because of the wonderful author, but also because LuLu is simply a delightful child. There were many passages in the book that touched me. I didn't read the book because I wanted facts. Instead, I wished to learn more about the interactions between a mother and a child who are not of the same race. I was far from disappointed.This mother loved her child so much that she wanted to return to the country where LuLu was born so that LuLu could better understand her origins and why she doesn't look like her adoptive mother. Some readers were troubled that LuLu might have been too young, but they are underestimating a child's capacity and resilience. I find LuLu fascinating. I wish her mom (the author) would write more about her adopted daughter and their life together."
2,Disturbing,"Wuhu Diary records the author's trip to Wuhu China with the daughter whom she adopted from that city. Adopted as an infant, Ms. Prager's daughter is five-years-old during the narrative, and has been coming to grips with being Chinese and American, and the daughter of a single white woman. When I heard the author interviewed on NPR I felt that the daughter was much too young for such an emotionally demanding trip and after reading the book I am all the more convinced that this is true. Not only does the daughter go to an orphanage (not the same one where she stayed ) but she is shown the bridge where she was abandoned. Before the trip she had thought she'd been left at a hospital, small comfort but at least some comfort. Now the daughter must, at five years old, process the truth of her abandonment to the elements and to sheer chance. I find the psychodrama unleashed upon the daughter positively appalling, and I only hope that she has a therapeutic avenue available to her."
5,Sometimes size does matter!,"This is a great little level. The vials have four lines, instead of just two, for centering, which really helps get it bubble (and therefore the level) in exactly the right place. The black rubber moldings around the tips help protect the most vulnerable areas of the tool, while making it easier to hold. It has a magnet in the base strong enough to hold it onto a pipe or other metal object. The little light inside makes seeing the bubble in low light conditions a breeze."
4,Excellent little level,"In short this is an excellent little level but it does have a couple of shortcomings.Pros:Seems to be the perfect shape and size and I have found myself using it more than any of my other (longer) levelsThe light feature is very useful especially when working inside drywall or in a ceiling cavityPrice is rightCons:The metal edge on the top of the level does not continue over the top of the horizontal level bubble. On a number of occasions I have lined the level up and just as I am about to draw a line on the wall I realize I need to use the other edge of the level.The taper at the edges reduces the useful width of the level. I don't see any advantage to the taper, I think I would rather have the straight edge continue to the end of the level.All things being equal I would recommend this product but the downsides listed above hold it back from a 5 star recommendation."
4,Good level,"The level works as expected and the light is a great help when working in dim environments. Personally I would have preferred if the sides were squared, but I knew what I was getting when I purchased this."
3,I have to say I'm a little disappointed,"This is a decent little level that will likely do all that a homeowner needs and is handy for the contractor as a ""throw away"" level in case you drop it or lose it. But it has one huge defect to my way of thinking. The dials light nicely and the build is decent, but the lights turn on with a huge rubber button on the side. This button is very easy to accidentally hit, both on and off during use, and more important, during storage. I use tool bags for all my tools, grouped by the tasks that I do. I bought 2 of these for those bags and frequently find them on as I move the bags around or in and out of the back of my SUV.If this were to always hang on your wall in the workshop then I'm sure it's fine. If you keep your tools in boxes or bags that move abut at all, it'll chew up the battery turning on when you don't need it. Yeah, it turns off automatically but that's not the point. I wish Stanley still made the FatMax version of the 16 inch."
4,Interesting disk of (mostly) second drawer Prokofiev,"This disk is a must have for all Prokofiev fans even though it features some of his less inspired music.There are a number of highlights. The music to ""Hamlet"" is Prokofiev at his most inspired and worth the price of the disk. The opulent cantata ""Hail to Stalin"" (1939) is also interesting and contains one of Prokofiev's most memorable melodies. Only someone as great as Prokofiev could write a piece of such quality to such a banal text dedicated to such an evil subject. The other propoganda piece on the disk ""Flourish, Mightly Land"" (1947) is also worth listening to.The other pieces ""Autumnal"" and ""Egyptian Nights"" are second drawer Prokofiev, but not without merits.The works are all given committed performances by the Russian performers and are well recorded."
3,Not the best,"While you can never really go wrong with a Bug's Bunny movie, I wouldn't actively recommend this one. While there are several classic cartoon shorts here (Sylvester as ""Jack"" in Jack and The Beanstalk, The selectively singing Michigan J. Frog, and Bugs as a ""baby monkey"", to name a few), most of them are severely cut. They are woven together, (though not smoothly), through a subplot which has Bugs and Daffy on a bookselling expedition. This in itself isn't terribly funny, and doesn't really go anywhere. ""The Bugs Bunny-Road Runner Movie"" and ""The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie"" are much better investments."
3,"Ehhhh, 2nd Worst of the WB Toon Movie Bunch","Laziness, and chunks of mediocre shorts are the flaws. This and DDFI could have been put up another star in my book if they used better shorts, or FINALLY used Black & White shorts. But, AT LEAST worthwhile."
1,Junk...,"I used this chisel set to remove dry rot from a wooden post. After 5 minutes, the blade of the large chisel was already pitted and chipped. I don't know what the blade is made of, but it is evidently softer than dry rot. Then I used the small one, and it too was chipped and pitted after only 2 minutes.The handles are made of plastic with no metal cap ends. These chisels are no better than what you get at a dollar store. I have been very disappointed with Stanley products lately. I bought Stanley leather work gloves that was literally unraveling at the seams as soon as I opened the package. I had to sew it back by hand. Then the inner lining started to fall apart after one use. No more Stanley for me!"
3,Good Starter set for the home handyman,Nice set for the home handyman. While not professional grade it does the job especially for cleaning up dead bold recesses in door frames.
4,"Pleasant, if Unremarkable","I'd still rate Herschel's discovery of Uranus as more important than the composition of these symphonies, but if the latter are down to earth rather than cosmic, they are nonetheless both energetic and soothing as well as a lot of fun. Taken as a whole, this disc is like so many early Classical compilations -- delightful at the time and leaving a nice glow, even if you can't quite hum the details afterward. The six symphonies were written by Herschel in the early 1760s, when he was approaching his mid-twenties. There's nothing terribly special about them, but they are, as I've said, nice little works that can delight. Matthias Bamert leads the London Mozart Players in performances that are polished and nicely recorded, just like the other discs in this series of music by Mozart's contemporaries. If you already have at least one disc of short symphonies by those contemporaries, you may not need this, but there's certainly no harm in owning it."
2,You don't get what you don't pay for,"From the description: ""This IS NOT an OCR'd book with strange characters, introduced typographical errors, and jumbled words.""From experience: Ooooooh yes it is.Examples:Location 269: Second Articl used before the masculine nouns with begin witli an S. followed by...Location 1000: tlngiiva, nnn* so forth. I flutter myself, tlii-ii fl iller'al thyself, he flatters himself, etcWe may likewise sny, To lusingami, fgli lusingami, c'Ir.See Paj^e 7 5 Thcso Verhs or railed reflective or reciprocal.You get the idea.Look, it's only 99 cents, so I'll give it two stars.But learning a foreign language takes much time and effort. Does it make sense to hold yourself back with poor tools such as this grammar book? Spend the extra 9 bucks and get Schaum's or something."
2,No Subtitles!?,"The series itself is great y chistoso, with lots of interesting situations y actrices buenisimas. However, if you're looking for any subtitles, either English or Spanish, you won't find them here. Quite a disappointment to release a DVD with ZERO subtitles. It appears that other DVD versions do have subtitles [...]. Amazon needs to correct the description which claims the product is in ""English"" when in fact there is only Spanish audio and no subtitles."
4,Easy to Use,"I've owned a competitor's (Cuisinart) processor for many years, and finally replaced it out of frustration with the safety interlock system which made it very difficult for me to use. The Kitchenaid processor is MUCH better designed and is easier to use and a snap to take apart and clean.It's small enough to leave out on the counter. The pieces are dishwasher compatible. Since our kids have moved away, I decided that the 7-cup was just fine for the two of us. My only complaint (voiced by others) is that the blade selection is limited to what comes with the machine for this Kitchenaid processor (which is why I've just given it a 4-star rating). The mini-bowl is something my other processor didn't have; it's great for those quick, small jobs and is also very easy to put in place and clean."
2,Great for potato chips!,"A good quiet machine, easy to clean BUT the slicing disc is only good for potato chips. The 2mm blade is the only one available for it and too thin for most applications. I called customer service and they said maybe by the end of the year!! read the other reviews and you will see they haven't done a thing to accomodate accessories. If you need versatility, don't waste your money on it. I should have bought Cuisinart, at least they have a selection of accessories."
2,Great Size - Great Pain in the Neck,"After owning a terrific Cuisinart food processor for 17 years, I replaced it with this Kitchen Aid model, thinking I was getting a top end appliance. I struggle with the bowl attachment - adjusting again and again until it finally goes into the slot, never on the first try. The shredder disk has an unstable connection. The blades are positioned so that the lowest blade is about 1/32"" above the bottom of the bowl, so if you want to chop vegetables for salsa, you end up with pulverized tomato sauce instead of pico de gallo - with no alternate blade available. It works well for hummus, but not much else. I think it's going into the next school garage sale."
1,"It'd be really cool, if it didn't suck","After two years of light use by one non-violent adult (me) the handle mechanism on the bowl fell apart. Now I turn on the machine and poke the activator button with the small end of a chopstick to make it go. Class act, KitchenAid.Naturally, a replacement bowl is forty bucks, for a hundred-dollar food processor. Since they're out of stock at two different Net suppliers, I suspect I'm not alone in my misery."
4,kfp 720,"Great size an ease of use.This model is sturdy & replaces a Wolfgang Puck food processor that is of inferior quality.Very pleased so far and pro Kitchen Aid, we own a hand mixer and a counter top mixer that is almost 35 years old with never a problem. Of course dark avocado is no longer a desirable color.con- a citrus juicer is available only in 9-cup and larger, bummer."
4,Really good!!,"This is a really good cheap self tanner! You get great dark color instantly, your tan last a few days. I highly recommend!"
1,Doesn't Hide the Flaws,"I bought this product to help cover up the stretch marks on my stomach from my pregnancy. I expected the tanner to somewhat lighten up the stretch marks but this product didn't work at all for that. Actually, the product wasn't noticable at all after I applied several layers."
3,It's ok.,"The bottle looks a lot different than pictured. Ingredients include (among other things) neem, black walnut husk, pumpkin seed, and notably garlic. These are a little hard to take every day because of the garlicy-ness. The ingredients seem to be consistent with other herbal remedies.I don't know if it really works. I can't say I noticed anything.One thing that does kind of bite is that the instructions say take 4 capsules a day for a week, then three capsules a day for a week, then one or two capsules a day for two weeks. 4 X 7 = 28, 3 X 7 = 21, 14 X 1.5 = 21. Add those up... 28 + 21 + 21 = 70. There are 60 pills in the bottle.It doesn't seem like a ripoff compared to a lot of other parasite remedies, so I can't say I'm totally dissatisfied. I'm just not all that impressed."
3,Yorksire Parish Registers (WR),"Extensive, but not comprehensive. Many missing parishes. Validation against some parish microfiche indicates good accuracy"
1,Superficiality in excelsis!,"The propaganda machine promoting Karajan is corporate based and well financed. My favorite packaging to appear thus far is ""Karajan Gold."" Karajan skates across the surface of Beethoven as he does with most other composers. There is little involvement here with the music, but you'll hear many flashy attention getting effects orchestrated by the egomaniacal Maestro. All is gloss and special effects. It is often said that this is the preferred set of Karajan's 3 (or is it 4) transversals of the great nine; and the sad truth is that this may very well be the case."
4,Big set that is grossly over-hyped.,"This collection in some bizarre way became ""standard"" version of force-fed Beethoven. It is well recorded but I prefer fresher and less pompous interpretations.I especially liked thisBeethoven Symphonies 1,2,3,4,5,6 and Art Galleries of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs Ultimate MosaicDVD CollectionBeethoven's music is full of emotions but when it is overturned with grotesque oversized, overemphasized emotions the entire performance sound hysterical."
2,Those who ignore repeats should be taken outside and shot,"Karajan shows no respect for the balance of Beethoven's score. Overall, there is little here to laud or hate......a bonus second star for spectacular execution by the Berlin Phil, without actually playing any music. Glossy, zero rubato, zero sforzati, continuous mezzo forte.In 20 years, music notation software with masterful samples will sound exactly like this: the most perfect and beautiful sounds a computer can generate. These performances are soulless.Give me Bernstein/VPO or Solti/Chicago any day over this rubbish."
1,Beethoven Symphonies,"The Beethoven Symphonies CD Collection I received via mail was surprising! Inside the bubble wrapped package were the CDs unprotected - not in jewelcases. Some were very scratched and some of the music, when played, was skipping. I kept the CDs nonetheless. I only respond because I was asked to review my purchase(s)."
5,"Bargain-priced, stirrring performances","If, like me, you already have the well-known symphonies, this is a great set to round out your collection. It is keenly priced, and mostly the performances won't disappoint.I was arrested by a strident flute in the 6th and 9th symphonies a couple of times, but I already have good recordings of those works.Warmly recommended."
5,Beethoven: 9 Symphonies - Berlin Phil - Karajan,"Excellent. I bought the box-set vinyls in 1970. Same stunning performance 1962/3 studio recordings on the 5-CD set, but digitally cleaned and does not sound at all dated. Recommended."
4,Listen to Waldemar Kmentt in the Ninth,"Beethoven's Symphonies are perhaps the greatest achievement in the history of music. I will not review Karajan's whole set, but it must be said that his recording of the ninth symphony is the one that brings the finest singers. And it is also the ONLY one that brings a tenor who has a voice that perfectly suits the music. It has often been said that Gundula Janowitz singing is beautiful. That is true, but Waldemar Kmentt's heroic tone is something truly unique. You shall NEVER hear another recording that will bring such a fine tenor. Beethoven's score was obviously written for a tenor of heroic tone, but most conductors (if not all of them)just fail to notice that and mistakenly place smooth voiced tenors to sing this part. It is incredible that such a mistake has been taking place for the past 200 years!! It is also incredible that Karajan has been the ONLY conductor who has noticed it."
5,"As all the reviews say, a great collection at a great price","This is a great collection of the symphonies. The 3rd is excellent, but they are all very good. I was also pleased by the overall sound quality - these discs are from the early 60s, but the sound quality is rich, immmediate and vivid, every bit as good as direct-to-digital recording I have.

3,"Uno mas for ""camper-mann""...","Not only are we in synch on the Hawk, but the ""camper-mann's"" views on von Karajan, specifically, and his Beethovens in general echo my own perfectly. Sterile, or maybe ""stiff"" was the word I used to describe his Dvorak B-minor Cello Concerto, even with the great Rostropovich. Giulini's is hands-down better, and he gets the best out of Rostropovich as well. It was only when I heard a perfectly preserved LP copy of William Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony from the 60s that the Eroica (and indeed all of the Symphonies) came to true life for me as well. I noticed the difference immediately. Cold. There is no other word for it. I'd love to send ""camper-mann"" a copy of my Steinberg and the Pittsburgh. He'd appreciate the difference a little emotion makes! i VIVA LA MUSICA!"
3,"Historically Significant, but Aging Shows","Analog recorded in 1962-63, digitally remixed in 1990. Original microphone limitations and positioning really show. High noise floor - sounds like an old LP album. Delicate passages barely show thru the fog. May be historically significant, for collectors who have the LP and want to convert to CD; but not particularly enjoyable for those accustomed to modern high quality digital recordings. Unlike fine wine, old recordings don't age well."
3,Not Excepcional,This Beethoven set isn't the best of the Karajan records. The 6th symphony' sound is too low; the 5th is a really explosion; and the 9th is disgusting ( I prefer Furtwangler or Harnoncourt conducting this record).
2,"Morphine, anyone?","The symphonies are capable of compelling one's emotions from the depth of tragic despair to the pinnacle of majestic triumph. Karajan's interpretation leaves one with the overall sense of being drowned in a bowl of oatmeal. The size of the Philharmoniker doesn't make up for their lack of enthusiasm or of clean articulation. Instead of reaching out and grabbing ones attention and enthralling them with its sheer genius, this interpretation is more a sedative, dulling the senses with its insipid blurriness."
4,Diffuse with....,"While I use the white Wal-Mart bag trick, I also use polyester quilt batting to diffuse the light. 1/4"" to 1/2"" thick does the trick. You can easly make a ""tent"" outa this stuff too. Note: the polyester quilt batting tends to transmit light as well as diffuse it, similar to fiber optics.This unit will work fine, though you should also look at the list to the right of this."
1,Useless,"Useless, don't buy it. The light emitted is too weak to give any effect on object being photographed. Tried different tricks to make use out of it but was not successful."
1,Keeps me in the dark!!!,"I bought two of these slave flashes to improve the lighting for some serious-amatuer work. I was disapointed to find that the units produce very little light. I can't imagine what they could be used for, honestly, as the light emitted from the flash was ineffective even under moderately lit conditions. The bottom line is that these units are as inexpensive as they come, and designed accordingly."
4,well Written and informative,"I love biographies and histories. This one of the better I have written. Dallek seems to have taken the time to demonstrate that as flawed as LBJ was, he also had grand vision and an enormous amount of pull with congress. I doubt that any president in the 20th and 21st centuries have had as much ability to get things done in congress as did LBJ. He hated Vietnam, but was a product of his times (read this book AND the President's club for a real eye-opener) who could not walk away and was so determined that he was right, that he ended up lying to everyone in the end. Had he the will to pull out of southeast asia when he wanted to (in 1963) he could have been a great president. But in spite of his dislike of the Kennedys, he was loyal to the office and refused to reverse JFK. It is a sad revelation of a truly gifted politician."
5,It was exactly what I asked for!,The product was fresh and packed well. It's was exactly what I wanted and the package was sealed tight. Thank you.
3,Abbado's Mendelssohn is prim and underplayed,"Unlike Mr. Grabowski, I love Mendelssohn, and in general I am also a great fan of Abbado in his years with the LSO, which found him at his most energetic and outgoing. But Abbado has a prim, clasical notion of Mendelssohn as a kind of second Haydn. We are far from the robust expression that makes Bernstein's versions of the Itlian and Scotch Sym. so thrilling; to that famous CD on Sony one could add Karajan's magisterial readings of both symphonies. Even Muti, not one of my favorites by a long shot, manages to impart more vierve and vibrancy than we get here. In all, a respectable but overly respectful recording."
3,5 stars for the performance / 2 stars for poor sound quality,"While you'd never know it from the 60's era photo on the cover, these are live performances from the 1987 version of the Bluesbreakers, with Walter Trout and Coco Montoya featured on guitars. They and Mayall are in excellent form, however many of their solo's are mixed too low to really appreciate them. Joe Yuele's drums on ""Room to Move"" are mixed so loud you can't hear the vocal percussion that make the song such a concert favorite. Even more frustrating there is inserted silence between the tracks that interferes with the banter with the audience and song introductions. The continuity of the CD as a live set is lost. On the other hand, this was a wonderful version of the band so if the price is right and you can live with the poor production it could be a nice addition to your Mayall collection."
5,"Gentle and poignant at first, then--BOOM.","For most of its running time, this story of growing up in 1930s Spain envelops the audience in a cloud of gentle, lyrical nostalgia. The evocation of long-lost boyhood is realized beautifully through the exquisite photography and the fine performances, particularly that of Fernando Fernan Gomez as a kindly, dedicated teacher. But as the shadows of the Spanish Civil War creep over the story, the action gradually gets nastier, building to an ending which is as shocking as it is tearjerking. ""Butterfly,"" beautiful and bitterly poignant, reminds me of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--if Atticus, Scout and Jem had all joined the lynch mob against Tom Robinson."
5,Check this one out.,I had to go see two spanish films for one of my college courses. I am not really into foreign films. But when I saw this one my heart just cried out for the boy and for his teacher. I love this movie. I recommend it to any one.
5,"Spectacular, Sublime","This film is a gem - precious, innocent, sublime, and subtle yet so rich. Spain viewed through the innocent eyes of a young boy, and the sensitive eyes of his older teacher. Being able to appreciate it in Spanish is even a greater gift. This film ranks right up there with the Chinese film, The King of Masks, and, French film Les Choristes. There are not enough stars in the universe to give this film."
2,Gardening in the coastal south,The info on line was misleading. I ws searching for information for Mexico as I have a home there. This title came up. It is not what I was expecting. The info on line led me to believe it would include Mexico.
3,Carolinas not coastal south?,"I bought this book thinking it was for my area as Wilmington NC is considered part of the coastal South as far as I know. The book focuses on Florida and right off the bat it shows a map of the author's definition of coastal South which doesn't include the Carolinas for the most part. I wish this had been stated in the PR for the book I would not have purchased it. So, although it's interesting I find myself reading it ""with a grain of salt"" because it doesn't really include my area."
1,"No thanks, I'll pass ...","I really enjoyed Ms. Murray's first book, *Larger Than Death,* and was looking forward to reading this one. But this book could be an example of ""What Not To Do"" in Fiction Writing 101 - if there is such a class (?). Within the first few pages, the author keeps adding more and more characters into the mix without giving much ""fleshing out."" Indeed, she might as well be just listing them, as on a playbill. I can make a passable family tree for intestate succession purposes, and that's what I had to do - start a family tree/character chart at the beginning. But then I just gave up as she continued to pile on the list of people. I've got enough challenges in my life without having to ""work at"" leisure time reading. My advice is to pass this one up.reviewed by mbmlaw"
2,only so-so,"I love books. I read most anything I can get my hands on, and the premise of this book is what interested me. There aren't many good books with larger ladies in them. Unfortunately, this is one of those books that isn't very good.The characters are shallow. I disliked Jo a little from the beginning because of her attraction to her dead friend's lover. Ew. THe friend had been dead for so short of a time, neither of them should have even THOUGHT of getting together.THere are too many characters, that you just don't care about. I had a hard time keeping them straight. My favorite character in the book is the cat. The rest just aren't very interesting. I had a hard time finishing the book at all.Very disappointing."
3,Taking aim at kidnapping and murder,"Full-figured Josephine Fuller has an unusual job: she checks up on charitable organizations for her philanthropic employer, making funding recommendations. With her sympathetic ear, she also seems to land herself in the middle of many dysfunctional family situations. That's not too bad, unless kidnapping, murder and other assorted crimes are at play. This is book two in the Josephine Fuller Mystery series. There were several references to book one, so it might be helpful to start at the beginning. I had a little trouble connecting with the characters, and found some of the plot elements far-fetched, but it was still an okay read for a hot summer day."
3,Large Target,"Large Target is an inside look of an over weight person. A person who has an interesting job and who loves it. I also love mysteries, especially murder mysteries. Give me one of those and I read til it is solved. Thanks for asking."
4,Delightful,"This selection of teas makes a great gift. It's a bit spendy, but the packaging is lovely and the pyramid-shaped tea bags are rather unique. I buy this for my mother every Christmas. The tea is so flavorful that I don't use sugar and cream with it as I normally would. It's good quality tea. But, be warned that the ordering process is frustrating. You have to call the toll-free number because the online ordering doesn't process correctly."
5,A New Xmas Read-Aloud Favorite!,"I just finished reading this book aloud with my 7- and 8-year-olds. They were rolling on the bed laughing from the beginning. Although some of the jokes took some explaining (They had no idea why cacti lining the streets of Dublin was a joke), they revelled in the humor, the ads and the aging Chapter 6. The divergent plot would certainly challenge the straight-laced ""See Dick run"" reader, but today's multi-tasking, cartoon-watching, video-game-playing kids should follow along just fine. We've just ordered ""The Giggler Treatment"" and can't wait to read that one together as well!"
2,let down--read the Giggler Treatment instead,"When my children and I found out that the Giggler Treatment had a sequel we ordered it immediately only to be very disappointed. Rover Saves Christmas just didn't measure up. We read the Giggler Treatment in one sitting--it was so funny my kids wouldn't let me put it down--it took us over two weeks to get through this one--rare in this house, and my five year old lost interest altogether. My seven year old found it mildly amusing, but it is not worth the hard cover price."
1,Horrible,"This product is so poorly done, it's hard to imagine that Bobbi Searle, anyone else, actually built this. The instructions are horrible. The material qualilty is abysmal. Even after several modifications and gluing and soldering (which are not supposed to be necesary) to get the thing to hold together, the final straw was that the motor is not powerful enough to operate the robot. I don't know who Bobbi Searle is, but I for one will know what name/author to avoid in the future. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS."
5,Excellent!,"Weil led a colorful, fascinating life. He became a well-known mathematician at an early age, and mastered several languages. Additionally, he traveled around the world, and narrowly escaped execution. His autobiography allows the reader to come to know him for himself, rather than for his work. If the reader pays close attention, he/she will see his subtle humor, which is cleverly woven in to his life story."
2,okay,"this tape was kind of funny but still the worst episodes ever made of south park.i will admit,i was cracking up in some scenes but some of the comedy is very overdone.i know if your a fan of south park you'll like this.i am,but im not completely crazy about it."
4,Great CD,I love this cd. It is very relaxing. I also love the fact that when I order from Amazon i receive my items very quickly.
3,Getting there....,"There were a few nasty programming bugs in this software. I'm playing it on a fast new system with tons of space and a top notch graphics card, and it looks great, but there are a few real problems. First, it crashes. The whole thing just shuts down every now and then. Second, the announcers have only a few things they can say, and so it gets a bit monotonous. Third, they're often wrong, which is kind of interesting but a bit annoying (in other words, they say it breaks left but it actually breaks right...they say it's in the sand, but it's on the fairway). Anyway, it's generally a good game, but there needs to be some QA done by the folks at Sierra Sports. By the way, their big innovation is this True Swing, in which you roll your mouse back and forth to commence the swing instead of a standard 3-click approach. It's interesting and more challenging, but doesn't make up for the basic flaws."
3,Before buying this......,"check out the highly rated Chicago Cutlery 'Centurion'. It sells for $19.99 and looks to be a duplicate of this one. Given the $39.99 price of the Calphalon, I'm not sure that the description is accurate. The description says the Calphalon Santoku Knife is made in Germany. However, I have found that virtually the entire Calphalon line is being manufactured in Communist China."
1,Knife is great but Amazon scams,"I was in the market for a santoku knife. Was in the process of ordering from another company when I found the calphalon one on Amazon. Wow! only $39.95, 40% off retail, must be a deal so I ordered that and another $100 worth of stuff. Imagine my shock when a couple of weeks later when I visited caphalon's web site and I see the same knife with a retail price of....$39.95!! Instead of a deal I paid retail! 40% off would have been $26. I emailed amazon about this and all I got back was a canned email about how they try to get the best deals. Lesson learned, don't believe amazon's prices. I've been an amazon customer for years, too bad they can't be trusted."
5,Exquisite and Painful,"Reminescent of The Man Who Fell to Earth and Tale of the Body Thief, Archangel Raphael is rendered human by Lucifer. Guided by Damiano and a feisty fellow slave, he struggles to find his place, stranded in a mortal body. He discovers his physical senses and love, in an enlightening journey of wonder and sorrow."
4,rawness and passion,This live album recorded in Barcelona (with extensive liner notes by Ken Stringfellow) captures the band the way I always wished their studio albums had: all is rawness and passion regardless of perfect pitch and time.
2,Posies Come Alive ain't all it could have been.,"Happy endings are always nice. It's a good thing that Jon and Ken decided to perform as the Posies again and that we have the Not Lame box set to look forward to, 'cause this here live album really wasn't much of a going-away present.Maybe it's the fact that it's taken straight from one show instead of compliled from a bunch of performances. Whatever it is, this album does not do justice to the Posies as a live band. The mix sounds sloppy, the harmonies are off more than they're on, and the song selection leaves a lot to be desired. It seems as if most of the effort was spent on Ken's incredibly detailed (and interesting) liner notes. Even the Cheap Trick cover is uninspiring.As a Posies live album, this was better than nothing, I suppose, but not much.Check out the far superior acoustic live album, ""In Case You Didn't Feel Like Plugging In"". It's a *much* better release than this."
4,"Read for the writing, not the recipes","Unfortunately, the recipes in this book haven't aged well. I imagine that they would have been a big hit--in 1947. But get this book just to read Beard's thoughts on food and preparation. It's not at the level of his later books, but still enjoyable."
3,Fat Max 6' Level,"Just a little disappointed. Usually the Fat Max name means ""Top of the Line."" This is just a mediocre level. It could use another grip cut out and a couple more vials for easier reading in odd locations. Works fine and is ""As advertised."" I just find myself holding on to my old one with the above features."
4,Timeless,"When I said old-school Nora, I meant it. This book was published in 1983, but aside from a few little things (who wears teddys and stockings anymore?) you'd never know it. Nora is as timeless as love itself. Nora's heroes are often so damn nice, but this guy had some mystery and rage going on too, so it was a good switch. If you're into illusions or magic at all, you'll have a great time with this book. Hooray for Nora!"
3,great,I didnt know really what to expect with this series.. I am so glad I picked it up. Much more adult than her other stuff and really entertaining. Buying the rest of her books!
2,unattractive female main character,"not a very good romance with a rich spoiled female character. If you want a book with magic moments, look somewhere else."
3,Not her best work,"While I did enjoy ""This Magic Moment"", I found it to be a bit boring compared to some of NR other offerings. Ryan and Pierce were not as exciting as some of her other characters, but it was a good read for the most part."
3,This isn't Randy Orton,The reason why it doesn't look like Randy Orton is because it isn't. It looks like it may be his dad Bob Orton.
5,These are great products!,"The downside ~ this web store recommends them for car decorations, but the manufacturer specifically says ""DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON CAR WINDOWS"" Other than that, this is a great all around product. They have a pretty good selection, but thegelstore.com has the largest selection and provides more information about the product itself."
3,It's Chalk.,"The chalk came as expected, completely shattered and broken. As far as the product goes, chalk is chalk. Thank you."
2,Not oversized by any standards,"While there were no dimensions listed on this product, it was billed as being big enough for oversized laptops. Well my hp dv9000 is way, way too big to fit on this and use a mouse at the same time. I can sit on my couch and surf the net a bit, but playing any games or doing any work (both require extensive mouse usage) are impossible. Guess I'll have to build my own lapdesk because all of these products are still built for the tiny 15.4"" laptops of last millenium."
2,Disappointing newer model...,"We got the original lap works fold out desk a few years ago. More recently my wife upgraded her laptop and we found ourselves fighting over the desk, to the extent that the most sensible solution was to buy a second one.A real let down. The new one does not fold open smoothly - or flat - and is very evidently produced more cheaply and from cheaper grade more brittle plastic that 'creaks' when you lean on it or apply any pressure.We're stuck with it now of course, the apparent victim of a company's success in the marketplace. Sadly, I cannot recommend it like I so easily could the original."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I had hoped to use this and have room for mouse activity...not so. I thought, based on reviews, that there would be room for my Laptop and external mouse. Only use for Notebooks - not Laptops if you're going to order."
2,Doesnt worth its price,"Provided you have NO knowledge on C programming and microcontroller, otherwise you dont really need this book. I personally think that big portion of contents could be found in CCS's manual and sample code FREE.Anyway, this book is more readable than the manual as it is more well-arranged, together with some explanation and diagram. This could be helpful to beginner with NO prior knowledge on embedded C programming."
5,"Wonderful, Fabulous,","This is a book that should be read by anyone in sales or marketing. This book would also being very helpful to business owners as well. The book gives specific examples of a variety of industries/individuals that gave customers ""Positively Outrageous Service""."
3,Pretty good quote book,"The print is small and the paper is not of the best quality (this is a paperback edition) and the contents are very much like those of the Oxford Dictionalry of Humorous Quotations, indeed, quite often the same ones, but I enjoy reading it and it is not very heavy at all."
2,A very poorly written biography.,"A biography full of inconsistent statements, leaving many questions unexplored, including basic ones such as ""when did Hawking find out that his illness was life threatening?"" and ""What role did his family play in his life during his student days?"". The explanations of the development of the main theories (relativity, quantum mechanics, the ""big bang"", etc.) are accessible to most readers, though no better than given by other books devoted entirely to the topic. Much of this material is poorly tied in to the biography itself. On a stylist level, the text is comparable to tabloid biographies of royalty, and is peppered with trite comments that contribute nothing to understanding Hawking as a person (""It has often been said there is a certain light in Oxford..."", ""The sixties were a great time to be alive and young...""). Hopefully, someone will write a properly researched biography one day."
2,Interesting material but poorly written,"Stephen Hawking's life and his research in cosmology are fascinating and based on that alone I enjoyed this book. However, the book is poorly written and lacks depth. It lacks any detailed description of Stephen Hawking's work and doesn't provide any true insight into his life or character. For example, the authors repeatedly inform us of what an overpowering presence Stephen Hawking has but they never provide any evidence of this. Good writers show you what they mean - they don't just repeatedly tell you.This book seems to based on no actual contact with Stephen or Jane Hawking or any of his colleagues. It seems that the authors read ""A Brief History of Time,"" read a couple of articles, and then decided to write a biography. It definitely comes up short."
5,comfortable and stylish,"the shorts are very functional. if you get them in the right size, they'll move freely with you. as an added note, i'm a fan of folding the waistband over (i think shorter people - including myself - are more inclined to do this in order to make the shorts fit better), and because the elastic waistband on these shorts are pretty wide, it fits nicely when done so (and still doesn't leave the shorts too short for working out). great for running and lifting!"
2,No One Inch Markings,"When I read the description of this item & saw that the readouts were 1/8"", I incorrectly assumed that these readouts would be in ADDITION to the usual one inch readouts found on all other tape measures I've owned. I was wrong. It had readouts of feet, a running inches readout (for example, 30"", 31"" etc.), but no readout that will tell you 5 feet 6 inches, for example. You can use it to find that your measurement is 66 inches & do the arithmetic in your head, but no convenient way to know that the readout is equivalent to 5 feet 6 inches. Because it's so common to find feet + inch readouts, I think the description of the item should mention that it had readouts in 1/8"" ONLY, & no one inch readouts. It's well-made, but doesn't serve my needs, so will have to be returned."
4,Better Than the Original,"Watch this movie BEFORE you watch the original 2007 ""Vacancy"" movie starring Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsdale. This movie is actually a prequel and helps you understand why the killers in ""Vacancy"" do what they do. I actually like this movie better than ""Vacancy"" and having Agnes Bruckner (""The Woods""/ ""Blood and Chocolate""/ ""Murder By Numbers"") in the lead role makes it all the better. The killings in this movie are realistic and only one of them is a little gory. I especially like the ending. This movie is definitely worth a rental and if you like it as much as I do its worthy of adding to your DVD collection."
4,Entertaining Sequel,"I enjoyed ""Vacancy 2""and found it to be quite believable .I also love that scream queen and vixen Agnes Bruckner was the heroine.I actually liked it as well as the first one. there was plenty of action and some good kill scenes nothing over the top but it's very well done.Your not going to find lots of gore but you will see believable kills and it's not mindless teenagers you don't care about being killed but well established likable characters except for one at the beginning we know nothing about, that makes it all the more disturbing but effective to watch. The acting is superb and the movie entertaining from start to finish.The entire cast is quite good and mesh well.Again the power play at the end of the movie is really a good one and makes for a tense and exciting watch I give it thumbs up."
3,Not Half Bad,"When released in 2007 , I thought Vacancy was one of the better horror films in recent memory and was a throwback to the seventies style of suspense horror. Almost two years, a prequel is released which explains how the events of the first film came to be. Given that the film is a direct to DVD release there aren't any big name starts in the film other than former child star David Moscow (from Big) and second rate horror actress Agnes Bruckner from Venom & Blood & Chocolate. Given the film's budget, there are some pretty impressive chase sequences and the musical scores helps to build the suspense in the film. All in all a fine rental and a nice way to waste hour at home."
2,not worth more than a dollar to rent it....,The first one was pretty good- this one on the other hand was horrible. I wouldn't rent it unless you are really board and can rent it from the dollar rental machine.
3,The first cut,"Vacancy's prequel is just your average Horror-thriller actually. In my opinion, it's not as good and suspenseful as the first one. I had higher expectations for this one, so it fell a little short for me. What I did like is that it adhered right to it's endeavor of making more sense of the original's premise, like a prequel should (not always the case with prequels and sequels). There's not much character development however, so you don't care much about them (just a lot of arguing); but there is decent acting, effects, and cinematography here. Overall I thought it was ok."
2,Vacancy should have stopped after part 1,"Vacancy Part 1 was absolutely excellent. Part 1 was actually one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and I seen a LOT of movies. This followup is extremely disappointing. Vacancy 1 blows away Vacancy 2 with ease. I sure hope there isn't a Vacancy 3 if it keeps getting worse. Or is there a part 3 I don't know about? Oh well, never mind."
4,Good Thriller,This is a decent film. Keeps your interest. Some suprises! I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes this genre.
3,Would definitely recommend it!,Does the job..It is about as convenient as any other level on the market. I like the light weight though.
4,he doesn't dumb it down,"Disagreeing with a recent online review, this book is valuable for its sociological scholarly analysis. Essentially every other book currently existing on the topic of zines is nothing more than a very limited and stilted collection of samples from zines every zinester worth their salt has already heard of ad nauseum. While Duncombe is a little heavy on the utopic and overly optimistic naivete in regards to the ability of alternative media subcultures to change the dominant mainstream as we know it, it was very refreshing to read a book about zines that didn't seem to feel the necessity to ""dumb it down"" for the zine kids, many of whom are exceptionally bright. This is certainly worth checking out if you do a zine and are into thinking, instead of regurgitating the same old, same old, as far too many zines do."
1,enough with the academic analysis already,blah blah blah what is up with this. zines are rad and shut up with the sociopolitcoeconomico crap. who would want to read this when they could be reading something real?
1,Doesn't work in my Epson c60,"I just tried to install this cartridge in my printer and it doesn't even recognize it. Fortunately the cartridges were cheap enough, but you would think they would work!"
4,"This is not ""A True Story""","Contrary to what another reviewer said, this volume does not contain Lucian's most famous work, ""A True Story."" For that, you will have to order Loeb Classical Library no. 162.However, this is a good and useful volume for seeing what Lucian's style was like. In particular, ""Toxaris, or Friendship"" is fascinating, though one may or may not agree with the portrayals of friendship contained therein."
3,Cat lovers might wince at this one,"The only facet of this clever, funny thriller that suggests its low-budget origins are the limited number of sets (with small exception, all the action takes place in a coffeehouse; the alley behind the coffeehouse; and Dick Miller's apartment). Everything else about the movie is perfectly fine, in particular Roger Corman's interesting direction and a script that refuses to be pigeonholed into one particular genre. If you prefer your thrillers to be a little quirky or off-center, check this one out. The MGM DVD delivers a good print-- standard format, alas, but no major cropping seems evident. Unfortunately, the promised trailer is nowhere to be found, but don't let that fact be a deal-breaker. After all, not many low-budget thrillers from the old days offer much entertainment beyond ""schlock"" value, so don't let a genuinely interesting entry from that era pass you by!"
4,Great Corman Flick,"Loved this little ditty from Corman. I'd just like to know how the cat got into the wall in the first place. Kinda silly when you think about it. But hey, the whole purpose of watching Roger's flicks is NOT having to think. If you love campy shlock, don't miss it!"
3,American International strikes again,"This is ok as a drive in movie and that is about it. I did like the beatnik atmosphere, the nerdy performance by the lead actor, and the sarcastic portrayal of this phony art crowd but the film is basically a one idea, three set movie that could only work as the second film on a double bill. When American International had a wildly exploitive script (like the superior ""Wild in the streets""), they could do some interesting films but most of their output was kitsch or schlock. This is in the latter category."
5,There is no paraben in this product!!!,"AFter the previous posting, I double checked the label, and there is no paraben. There is panthenol which is Vitamin B... I have used the conditioner and really like it - looking forward to trying out the shampoo as well."
5,Big Noooooyyyyyyyyyddddddddd,This is Noyd's best cd to date it is better than his only the strong which I also liked too but his lyrics on this one are much improved at first you think he is just at the bottom and the only reason he is out is because of Mobb Deep even though they have helped him tremendously Big Noyd is making a name for himself and on this album his lyrics are getting better this is highly recomended for any Queensbridge fan or Big Noyd fan Cop this album youll be glad you did
1,"Terrible book, and highly misguided.","This is by far one of the worst books I have had the misfortune of stumbling across. The author is clearly misguided in his approach. In addition, the endless series of mistakes makes this, ironically, a most unlikely guide to ""Errors in English"". The author's glaringly superficial understanding of grammar and etymology undermines what attempt this book makes of being an authoritative voice on the subject."
1,where is it,"i havent gotten a single issue yet , dont understand why payment went threw so whats the problem . Just waiting"
5,"""Hey Doc"", What About ""Night Journey""?","In 1977 i heard the lp ""Night Journey"" for the first time. I still have the lp, but would love to have it on cd. How 'bout it Doc , please release it again. Anybody else who has heard this album please help us out here."
4,Holds charges well,"This is a battery for Panasonic digital camcorders. The battery is also a Panasonic brand. This battery charges quickly, and holds a charge well.Like most batteries, you will notice the battery dies quite quickly if you use the LCD screen. This is kind of a vicious circle: You bought the camcorder because of the nice LCD screen, but you are hesitant to use it because the battery dies so quickly. A happy medium may be to buy a camcorder with a color viewfinder.All in all, a good battery, and a good value."
3,beauty you pay for,"this is a great phone, it works well, it looks ever so pretty. it's way to expensive for what is in essence a pdf with a phone. if you like the beautiful look to the phone and don't mind paying the cost, get it. but, if you are not rich, and need something that does all the things this does, get a cheaper phone. i think there are $150 (almost half the cost) that do them better."
5,I highly recommend it !!,I bought this phone twice.. first i got the black one then the red one...it has everything you expect a cell phone would have...nice size for a touch phone.....2 Mega pixel camera....external memory....and more!! you wont regret buying it i promise...works for T-Mobile perfectly and for all carriers that use SIM Cards..
2,more bad news than good,"A very attractive phone with lots of good features, but quite a few problems. The touch screen is great, sound quality and basic phone functionality are all great. The PDA functions are not so great -- not a fan of Motoroal phone tools - which will synch contacts with both my Outlook and Lotus Notes -- but will not synch the calendar with either. There are a lot of petty annoyances -- the voice recognition is terrible, no speed dial, the calendar is almost unusable, setting up the browser is difficult, the phone came set-up for Chinese -- finding the change language to english screens was not totally obvious. On the plus side, the MP3 player is great, the radio is great,"
5,Smart phone,"I just got this phone a few days ago and i love it. It has every feature you can possibly want a phone to have, including email access, fm radio, camcorder mode and more. It is compact, has a touch screen and a whole lot more i can't remember to mention.This phone is a must have."
3,Review of Motorola Ming A1200 Phone,Excellent phone... poor battery life.. ear speaker finally failed after 2 years... 1Gb maximum on mermory transflash card
3,"Amazing phone, but texting is impossibly frustrating","the Motorola Ming is an AMAZING phone, but to everyone out there who texts at all, this is not the best phone for you.. I had this for 2 days and finally decided to take it back and get a different phone with a keypad. Other than the texting though, its an amazing phone"
2,You will regret !,"The phone is ok. However, the battery is a joke. You will need recharge it every night. J&R includes a (paid) bulk adapter to fit american standards : a minimum movement of the adapter and the charger will not work while you believe that your phone is getting power ! The bulk adapter is useless since you can simply remove the european plug and use the two pin plug that originally comes with the charger. The Motorola Phone Tools is another joke: simply does not recognize the cell !"
4,Motorola Ming A1200,"The phone is fine, but the service was excellent.I was impressed that a refund was processed so seamlessly and so quickly; customer satisfaction is obviously your major concern...as it should be!Thanks very much.Carlos G. SANTOS"
3,satisfactory,"It was hard to find the U.S. conversion button because it was written in Mandarian, otherwise, the phone had alot of sassy features."
2,Looks nice..but not at all in reality!,"I bought this phone few weeks ago!...First of all the battery life-time sucks!...It doesn't even last 4 continuous hours...In addition, I have such a problem for setting-up the network (T-Mobile)... I called the network and they said I have to call the manufacturer..then called Motorola and they couldn't help me at all suggesting to call my network...at the end...I cannot use the greatest features that this cell phone has... Don't buy it until you are sure your network has support for it!"
5,Exxellent!!!,"Excelente compra!! muy rápido y eficiente la tienda. Recomiendo 100% comprar productos por esta tienda. Compré el celular desde Caracas, Venezuela y lo recibí satisfactoriamente!!!."
4,Excellent (PDA) Cell Phone,"LO BUENO:PEQUEÑO, FUNCIONAL, RAPIDO, MUCHAS FUNCIONES!LO MALO:DIFICIL PARA ABRIRLO, VOLUMEN MUY BAJO, NO SIRVE EL MSN (ESTA EN CHINO), DIFICIL ENVIAR MENSAJE CON UNA SOLA MANO!!!!PARA TODO LO DEMAS!!!! MASTER C...D"
1,Not really!,"The videos provided for the signs are very difficult to comprehend. I am taking an introductory american sign language class at a community college, and I got this to help me practice, but the signs do not correspond with what I am learning in class. I do not recommend this to someone who is serious about learning this language."
2,Not as good as i thought it would be,"I expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd, i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked, besides that this album is garbage"
2,Tears of the Sun - lacking,Harsh words but I suppose I expected the music to be stronger than it was....
5,Tears Of The Sun,"A terrific soundtrack by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) that once again takes you on a journey that reaches into your soul. It captures the essence of the movie, filling the room with sound that you not only listen to, but become involved with. A must have for music collectors."
5,ABSOLUTELY GREAT SOUNDTRACK,Hans Zimmer is a genius and this is one of those soundtracks that I just had to have in my collection. The sample that Amazon provides doesn't do it justice; there isn't a track on this CD that I didn't like.
1,CD does not play. Don't waste your money.,I'm not sure why but this CD does not play what so ever. Tried it several times in several different CD players. Not one would work. Thinking somehow that it was the player itself I tried other CDs and they all play flawlessly. Obviously something is up with this disk.Thinking of a work around I decided to Rip this to my computer hard drive and then listen to it from there. Instead this disk crashes my computer evrytime I put it in.Complete waste of money. I'll be contacting Amazon tomorrow to see if I can get mine back.
1,Great product if you can get it out of the can,"We bought two new cans of Cutter Unscented Backwoods Insect Repellent at the start of summer and were immediately disappointed to find the cans were very hard to spray--you could break your fingers trying to get any product out of them. Two cans are an investment of over $15.00, but necessary in order to avoid bug bites the size of golf balls after only a few minutes outside. I found I could get the cans to spray as long as they were completely level so now I place a can on a level surface and spray the repellent into my hands to wipe manually--not exactly ideal but what were my options? I called Cutter customer service to report the problem---but they weren't helpful. I'll stick to the Off products from now on--they spray beautifully."
4,good product,Easy to use and effective. It burned the skin slightly for few minutes after application to skin. This is the reason I gave a 4 stars rating. I had no mosquito bites during the whole trip in Cambodia and Vietnam. You can ship in your luggage.
2,Evidence?,"This book uses fictional stories. Fake people make tons of money in the stories using Navarro's strategies. Those fake people seriously know how to pick stocks.It's probably still worth reading, but I'm taking the advice in the review ""dangerous."" Why? Because I have absolutely no idea if his advice has ever worked for a real person. It seems far too large a commitment of time and mindset without much more evidence that it works.I'm starting to hunt down people who've tried it. So far, I've looked at Tobin Smith, who practices change wave investing. Apparently the guy's track record is dismal. So far so bad, but of course that's not enough to discredit the book."
4,Great Product,"This seems to be a combination of Wu, Yang, and Chen (I could be wrong,) done at a relatively fast pace. This will definitely give you a good stretch, and work your muscles/joints.The form itself is demonstrated by Yu Xuande and a student. I noticed at times the student's form (foot placement/ hand posture) is somewhat different from that of the instructor. However, the instructor then does the form slowly, repeating the motion in great detail, and explaining the application. This is relatively easy to follow and pick up in a short amount of time.The English translation comes in the form of subtitles, which can at times be difficult to understand due to lack of grammar/mistranslation. Nevertheless, this is a great DVD, well worth the cost, as long as you are willing to overlook these small issues."
1,Don't Bother!,"Unless you're an English major, don't bother. Dodsworth doesn't travel well into the 21st Century - it's stilted, dated and generally boring. The movie is alot better!"
1,"""Show me the money!""","The cast of mostly fine actors (Cuba Gooding, Jr., James Woods, Anne Archer) must have been echoing CBJ's classic line from his Oscar-winning role in ""Jerry Maguire"" when they agreed to appear in this wretched misfire. When the President is assasinated, the agent in charge of his safety (Gooding) and a maverick reporter (Angie Harmon) go on the trail of the conspiracy behind the crime. The dull investigation requires all the deductive expertise of a child's connect-the-dots puzzle, existing merely as a skeleton upon which to hang the various action scenes, some of which are quite good. Not good enough, however, to rescue this amateurish attempt at a screenplay. End review."
3,Empty Thriller,"***This thriller had exceptional actors, lots of excitement, but really failed to deliver plot, had a totally dissatisfying ending, and in the end really felt like a complete waste of time. In addition, the camera work was erratic and weird (probably some attempt at artistic effect) and jumpy. My husband and I watched it and were so disappointed; we'd wondered why we'd never heard of it, when it starred such great actors. The reason is, it's an empty and incomplete movie.I rated it three stars instead of one because the actors are great performers and fun to watch, plus the excitement level of the movie is high, even though it pans out to nothing in the end.***"
3,Just Average,"This movie had some good moments, but overall, there were lots of visual shots that just didn't make much sense, for instance, all the shots of cell phones. The end left much unexplained, so that was a bit frustrating. Plus, it didn't seem realistic that the Secret Service would let a reporter play such a critical role in an investigation, even to the point of dragging her along on interviews. There didn't appear to be any chemistry between Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Angie Harmon, nothing at all. And Burt Reynolds seemed to be wasted; his character didn't add much. But at least James Woods added some spice. I won't watch this movie again, but it wasn't an unpleasant experience."
1,Dull,"Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a secret service agent who is guarding the President of the United States. He is assassinated on Cuba's watch. Of course, he's consumed with guilt. A Pulitzer Prize winning reporter is trying to uncover what really happened and gets Cuba involved.Sounds like it should be fascinating, doesn't it? It was dreadfully boring. Don't waste your time on this dud."
2,"""End Game"" had its moments--sadly, not enough of them","It's the old ""Fallen Samurai"" plot. Alex Thomas (Cuba Gooding) is a Secret Service Agent who is wounded trying to stop a Presidential assassination. Kate Crawford (Angie Harmon) is a reporter, who's trying to get to the bottom of the assassination.While Gooding's always 'good', the plot just didn't keep the suspense boiling like it should. I don't think that he and Harmon had the chemistry they needed--and the conclusion was somewhat obvious to me from near the beginning of the movie.It's worth a rental if you like Gooding, but overall, don't buy the film."
5,Vintage Munro...A Working-Class Writer,"I have come to the fiction of Alice Munro late. She has been producing extraordinary short stories set in Ontario, Cananda mostly for decades. And she captures a working-class world for me that speaks to my own roots. The stories are about people first and I expect place secondly, but her sense of the culture and social stratification are so accurate they make me remember and realize. Her sense of detail and dialogue are also accurate and winning. I give this big compendium 5 stars, and recommend her to all."
4,"quite good, but a bit old info","Having experienced medical care in five different countries, according to my experience varieties in treatment in different countries are very common. Though former British colonies still retain lots of resemblance to British health system. My only objection to the book is that it needs an update - lumpectomies instead of radical mastectomies are getting more common in US. However, hysterectomy, often unjustified, is still far to common in US with no hope for change in near future. Also, doctors seem to be unable to understand that different countries have different disease statistics even after you bring them articles printed in medical journals proving that you are right. Medicine does not deserve to be called science, IMO."
5,God's Love and Love for Each Other,"""The Scream"" is Book 9 of a Teen Christian Fiction Series called ""Forbidden Doors"".The main characters are teenagers Becka and Scott, and their mother. (Their dad's plane went down.)The little family are awesome Christians. They have a friend named Z who sends them on assignments to help people involved in any type of darkness. The assignment in this book is a trip to Los Angeles to help a member of a Rock Band, Mike. The main leader of the band, Dothan, is full of hate and reverends the Enemy. Will Becka be able to convince Mike to leave the biggest band in the country?I loved this book. I found it very cozy. It is very encouraging; it reminds us of God's Love for us. It also reminds us that money and/or power will not get us to Heaven. One of the main reasons I found the book awesome, is because it truly indicates that God is so full of Love and the Enemy is so full of Hate."
5,Great Stuff,"Randy Sandke and the Rias Big Band have always been favorites of mine and together, they're exceptional."
3,Nowak for 8 spoils the set,"Because Jochum follows Nowak for Sym 8 (not Haas), this spoils the whole set, in my view. Haas is IMPERATIVE for the slow movement of Sym 8 (see Robert Simpson's book).Sound is not wonderful in this set either (quite a bit of hiss).But the performance of Sym 2 is great, so the set does have good bits."
5,Big Knife,"I did not realize how big this knife acutally was, but i am happy with it. I bought it for a camping trip, but that was maily an excuse to buy a big knife"
4,IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE,"Back in the early to mid-ninties. Two young fellows a Bassist and a Drummer created some of the most bombastic noise rock around. The group was called GODHEADSILO. They rocked so hard I still kick myself in my nutty buddies!!!In summary, it has already been done."
4,"Oh, lightning bolt is so fine~","I first heard of them when i bought the soundtrack to 'Dedication'. Their unique blend of noise rock has almost an ambient quality. Killer bass, awesom-azing drums, and lyrics [allegedly]! You buy it too. You will like it. If you don't then give it to your kids/nephew/little brother/ creepy neighbor. Makes a wonderful gift, especially for a holiday like 'April'!"
2,Definitely not casual entertainment,"I gave the rave reviews the thumbs up because everything they say is true. The arrangements are intricate, complex and executed with creativity and energy and without flaw. You might like this band, I just didn't like it at all. I like to be entertained by music, whatever the style, and I like it to ""speak to the heart"" rather than the mind. I prefer a good book or BBC series for intellectual stimulation.I also get bored of ""rock"" without lyrics. My reaction was the same when 10 or 15 years ago I purchased Stewart Copeland's solo/instrumental album. It was a yawner. Yeah, there were cool bits and Copeland is an awesome drummer but I had this really ""neutral"" feeling at the end of both of these recordings like I just came out of a modern art museum and said the word ""Interesting..."" but didn't expect to ever return."
5,"Excellent author, excellent book","Great book, every page of it. If you are not very acquainted with India history and if you are seeking for a concise history of British Rule in this country, this is for sure a good choice. The reading is absorbing, in particular on how the author explain the most important aspects of the 350 years of interaction, using lots of real notes and letters of those who lived there -- accounts that help you grasp, and understand better, how was it to live in India in those years, both for Britons and Indians. The relationship was difficult and left some sensibilities in the Indians that last to this day, but I think it was meant to be since both rulers and ruled were so different in almost every aspect.One corollary from the partition of India is that is not good to have two strong religions in a country, for that meaning rivalry and violence. You can see that also in the ex-Yugoslavia and even in today Iraq (shia and sunni muslims)."
4,not the best in the series but sets up the last two books,"this is definitely one of the slower doctor dolittle books. the beginning is a dog biography of professor quetch, and then there's a large section where the doctor learns insect language and several types of insects tell stories. the last section, where the doctor is sent a messenger from the moon, leads directly into doctor dolittle in the moon and doctor dolittle's return, the last two books in the series."
4,Major Design Tool,"Ashby's compilation of data and explanation of methodology is excellent and results in a must read for technical persons who will be involved with the selection of materials for design. The numerous material charts included are invaluable when trying to compare, and ultimately decide upon, different materials for a design. Also, the example cases presented compliment and help explain the different approaches to selecting the most suitable material for a given design.Overall the book is easy to read and a good addition to the office or home."
5,Great reference,"I am a design engineer of 20+ yrs and have designed thousands of components in major water, wastewater, chemical, and petroleum plants in every state in the US. I wish I had a book like this 20yrs ago! An enormously valuable reference for making designs cost-effective."
4,Hard Sayings - Easy Reading,"I would recommend this book to anyone. It would be useful for the layperson who has question or the Sunday School teacher preparing a lesson or a pator or even a seminary student. Bruce takes many of the hardest sayings of Christ and gives a good interpertaion in just a few pages. If you want in depth coverage of a text then look somewhere else, but if you want a quick overview and solid answer this is the book to do it. If nothing else its a good reference book to have on your self, especially since its so affordable."
4,Awesome Research Book.,Very thought provoking and a good research book. Great read for any Biblical student.Well worth the price for the material contained.
3,pretty good,Interesting and helpful but not as surprising or insightful as I had expected. Still a worthy aid for study and reflection.
4,No Dice,"I purchased this for my boyfriend as a gift. He loves the board game, and was able to easily teach me how to play on this. Graphics are great, the sound is entertaining for a while, but it gets a littl bit agravating. I thought it was great on the pc, but he thought it was better as a board game because he gets to roll the dice by hand. Personal preference there I suppose. He said the dice are half the fun of the game. Risk does get you thinking and stratagizing. It's probably good to boost your IQ, though that's just my thought. I don't know. Oh, one more thing. If you're in a bad mood and want to just take over the world, break out a pc game of Risk and go for TOTAL DOMINATION. Lol"
2,"great fun for more, bad if it's just you and your pc","I love this game in any version, on the board it takes too long though, so got the PC version which is great on a big screen with some friends or family. Now when nobody is home and you try to play against computer players - just forget it, there is no AI involved there, you'll be the only one thinking about strategy. Although they post that the generals have different strategies and behaviors - they just blindly fight towards their own missions with little aim and sense and no care for the rest of the board. Most of the games you will win within 5 turns or so, it's just boring, even maddening how stupid the AI players behave. Had the first PC version of the game back in the 90s - that was much better..."
4,Rickman never fails to deliver,"Phil Rickman is known for writing intelligent, literate stories of horror and the supernatural. This book is no exception.In this Reverend Merrily Watkins mystery, elements of the supernatural combine with plain old human wickedness. Rickman's books are long, but for the reader who appreciates an intelligent and well-written novel, they are worth the effort. I ordered my copy from Amazon.com.uk -- US readers are lucky to now have _A Crown of Lights_ available stateside.Recommended. Also, treat yourself to his back list - Rickman writes some of the finest and most original work in this genre. In addition to the Merrily Watkins mysteries, Curfew, December, and Man in the Moss are highly recommended."
2,Boring,"After the 5 star reviews I purchased this first,for me, Phil Rickman book.Unfortunately I was bored with the whole thing. I did not find the characters appealing. There was too much explaining and background material. I slogged through the first part then skipped until the end."
3,Wild Child,"Sex,drugs and bluegrass. Great story about the wild rides of a cotton trader and his hot girl friend. Well told and paints an incredible picture of the high life in NYC in the 70's."
1,does not work as advertised,"After attempting to download a 1.5 hour video, it took over 4 hours, appeared to be downloading and completing, then didn't show up on my iPod. I wrote the company and they said they would look into it and get back to me. After hearing nothing, I wrote back again and they said they had referred it to another level. I still haven't heard anything back. Don't waste your money, the customer service is terrible."
4,Dacal 300,"I purchase the DC 300 and very happy with it, yes it does not read the DVD, But if you purchase Movie Collector software it works very well with DC 300. I going to purchase three more of these unit."
1,How could this woman be named after Vikki Carr?,"In this book, Vikki Simmons says she was named after Vikki Carr after her parents read about the singer in the paper. Do the math -- Simmons says she was born in 1951. Vikki Carr (born 7/19/1941) was 10 years old in 1951 and didn't become famous until the early 1960s. She wasn't even called ""Vikki Carr"" in 1951 -- it's a stage name! Really, if Simmons can't get that fact straight, you wonder about the rest of the book."
5,Great book,This is a great book for those who have lost a loved one. We lost our son at 16 and I knew nothing about the stages of grief we all experience. The Christian author has also experienced losing loved ones and speaks from her heart.
5,There is hope,"I have just finished reading the older hard copy of this book, loaned by a friend. I have just lost my 37 year old son in a tragic death. I have cried my way through this insightful book. Because it belongs to a friend I could not underline all the passages that meant so much. If I had it would be greatly marked. To know in a new way that I am never alone, I will make it and there are lessons to be learned in this tragedy if I will be open to His leading was such a reinforcement for my faith. I have read several books in the last 3 months and this one has been the most practical and useful to me."
3,Okay,"I bought this book to help me understand how to help others through grief. I wouldn't recommend it to give to a grieving person, but it gave me some insights. A girlfriend who lost her daughter in a traffic accident said it helped her."
4,"Good Battery, Probably Not Enough Life","This battery is rated to last one hour 15 minutes of usage. However, if you use the digital camcorder's LCD screen at all, you can cut that time in half.Therefore, unless you only record thirty minutes at a time, this battery probably doesn't have enough juice for you. I would recommend the CGRD16A/1B, which is about $100 bucks. That battery has about three hours rated usage, or 1.5 if you use the LCD screen. That is enough time for all but the heaviest user.If .75 hours is enough for you, then this is a good battery that retains a charge well."
5,Opening Overture! Amazing! My best version yet!,I've own several versions of Tannhauser and let me tell you just get it. It's outstanding. The mix is as good as any and it blows away my other collections in terms of the performance as well as the musicianship.
1,Yet another waste of valuable money!!!,"I bought these the other day at BestBuy, and they SUCK!!! I was looking for something else, but I just had to buy something, anything! I'm ashamed of myself."
1,I can't believe it!,"I have looked up to Avril as a role model. After knowing she was a hunter and other information, I have started to look down on her. How could this be? Avril must be way over her head. An autobiography? She must be kidding. And I thought she was writing new songs. If she does not write a new song soon, she will be forgotten and a new rock star will be my role model."
1,How sad...,"How sad that someone has to work hard to be good enough for you, for me if she never wrote another song, i'd still be happy with the ones i got! Shes a fantastic artist and is willing to go out of her way for her fans, that deserves respect its self... have you heared what happened in Dublin?"
1,oooh...avril & a pretty swirly thing,"i dont really know what the heck this is , but its avril, there fore it sux.....ahhhhh! what a poser!!!!!!! maybe i could sleep better if i covered this cd with bleach and acid....or use it as a defense weapon that i could throw at sad avril loving souls and hit them in the jugular with"
1,Boring,I found this whole cd pointless.. I love avril but I should have gotten something else for the money I spent on it. It's not even official and it has a bunch of some doinky elevater music playing in the background with it... I should have read the back which says it has no songs bye avril. Plus the narrater is really boring~
1,"*Important!! Please Pay Attention, this Isn't an Avril Disk*","This isn't an album from Avril. Someone else put it together. It doesn't contain her music. It probably has no connection to Avril Lavigne. Please read carefully before purchasing.The product is an: 'Audio CD Book on a Full Color Picture CD. Contains a Biography, W/Comments and Interview.'"
3,Chrome Dreams Maximum CD's,"In case people are probably wondering about this CD, it's probably a documentary or audio-biography of Avril Lavigne. Chrome Dreams publishes Maximum CD's every now-and-then of known pop stars. If you type ""Chrome Dreams Maximum"" in the search box, you'll get a whole bunch of CDs and books from them that has the word ""Maximum"".Just a little bit of 411 here incase anyone is thinking that Avril is coming up with some new album soon. Last I read an interview of her, she didn't even start on it yet but that was around last month. She must of had at least one song done by now if she started it recently. I'm actually looking forward to her tribute song to Metallica with Sum 41, KoRn, and Limp sometime soon. Might want to check the PRESS section in Avril Lavigne's official website."
1,This isn't an album its a biography wtf!,I thought this was an album. It finally comes out and I find out that its a freaking biography.For all we know Avril Lavigne could be making songs right now for a new album. WARNING:Biography could get boring!! If there was 0 stars i would have given it that.
1,This isn't an album its a biography,Im dissapointed because I thought this was a album but all its a bigraphy and no music is on it!!
1,DUMBEST CD EVER THOUGHT OF!!!,"This wuz just a fat waste of time, energy, and money! Avril made a big mistake by making this piece of [junk]! I saved up my money 4 ever!! And all i got was this!! Now nobody is gonna buy her next album thinking its gonna be a jip like this one!!!! =(:x"
4,Well worth reading,"The road to Exreme is an intimate examination of the forces behind much of the destruction of the Brazilian rain forest. Even if the forest is protected, the poor stream out of the slums to build their dreams of land ownership and owning their own home. They have nothing to lose. If they are evicted, they simply return to the city to plan the next attempt. News of illegal forest settlements opening up electrifies the city's poor. The temptation is like an eternal flame burning the jungle to feed the dreams. Depressing but informative."
5,Great Science Textbook for Home Schoolers,"I bought this book for my home schooling, ballet-dancing daughter. She is actually learning the principles of physics without complaint because she can relate the science and mathematics with practical application. She is 14 yrs old and grasping concepts on a college level."
5,A review of Physics and the Art of Dance,This book made a great gift for our daughter who is a member of her college dance company. We gave it to her following completion of her first college year. She loves the book and it has become part of her reference library.
5,Arkansas Rider's guide Second edition,"The Arkansas Rider's guide is a very important part of Our motorcycle gear that We take with Us when We tour Arkansas. It contains detailed maps and directions of day rides,places to stay, and most important the best places to eat. Also, it is small enough to store in most tankbags."
3,Mehhh,"I bought this because I needed to switch between four servers that I had running in my office, it is a little glitchy and one of the buttons stopped working for a little bit and then began working again. In the end I went ahead and bought a older compaq 8 monitor unit. so i rate it mehhh......."
4,Like a Dream!,"plugged it in and fired up all 3 towers, works great! only problem is that it doesn't come with a power supply so my USB mouse still has to be moved from tower to tower, but with front USB ports, that's not a problem for me. Just thankful I don't have to move my keyboard from tower to tower anymore! The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is that there's no link to the power supply that would go with it... but it works just fine without if you have a PS2 mouse (which is what it's made for)."
3,CTRL-CTRL-B-Enter= no more beep,"CTRL-CTRL-B-Enter= no more beepwish i could change the hotkey to something besides CTRl, tho. Like numlock. anyone know how?"
4,Great KVM!!!! with only 1 little issue,"This is a very nice 4port KVM @ a great price by the time. The only issue is everytime i switch to another computer, it always BEEP once, and there's no way to turn this beep-sound off..... but this certain not a deal breaker :)"
5,Works Great,"I use this for 3 computers and leave the 4th wire empty for the occasional repair work I do for relatives and friends. It works great for me. I wish it had some mounting system so I could hang it on a wall, but it's no problem to sit it beside the machines either...No outside power is required, it draws straight from the ps2 port.I'd definitely recommend it."
3,A cultural study of Weimar,"Reading the book I could not get rid of the impression that Peter E. Gordon uses or misuses Heidegger to polish up Franz Rosenzweig, a philosopher that does not reach up to the philosophical complexity of Heidegger. The comparative lecture is therefore not always in a good balance. The interpretation - though very well written, with a didactic effort - sounds sometimes ""forced"" and is in several chapters not really philosophic. It is a good study of Weimar intellectual culture, not so much a philosophic one. It seems as if Gordon felt himself obliged to write a ""comprehensive"" book for a large public, not so much for scholars of philosophy, who will probably skip several chapters to ""get to the point""."
3,"Nice watch, but....","This watch is very nice and dressy, but unfortunately the band cannot be adjusted without sending it back to the factory in California. It would have been helpful to know this before I ordered the item. I decided to return the watch to the seller. If you have a large wrist, this watch will be perfect for you."
5,"great quality, sharp looking","I bought this watch because I have a similar one (that I love) from Citizen that is gold and needed a silver-colored watch for certain occasions. Both watches are wonderful. I particularly love the fact that I don't have to replace a hard-to-find battery once a year. The watch keeps perfect time and I never give a thought to exposing it to light. Just normal wear allows it to get all the light it needs.The band is perfect for me. I don't have to struggle with a clasp, nor deal with it constantly coming undone as I have with previous bands. It is stretchy and simply slides on to your wrist. If you have a tiny wrist, you may not want this type of band as I don't think there is a way to make it smaller (but the stretchiness easily accomodates larger wrists).My last Citizen watch lasted me 15 years till the band finally gave out. I believe they make quality watches that look great and are reasonably priced and definitely recommend them."
3,Minor TV movie,"A minor suspense film. Looks like it was made-for-cable. Okay acting. An architect, visiting LA on business, is terrorized by an unseen enemy (who may be an angry road rage trucker). The detectives investigating the incidents are especially poorly portrayed: flatly written and performed with boredom. And the prostitute with a heart of gold is sexy, but her role is just silly.The sets and characters kept reminding me of The Landlady, a more boring film, that also had a prostitute living across the hall from the protagonist. The wife is played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson (who was great in Circuitry Man), who seems to have shot her few scenes in one day, in the same room (aside from a shot at the end).I'm giving it a generous three stars because it was still entertaining, in a low-brow/low-budget sort of way."
2,Pretty Good Suspenseful B-Movie,"Another B-movie from Rob Lowe with a zing for anyone who wants a somewhat predictable, but interesting movie from our favorite west wing moron. It's nothing new from all of Rob's other movies except there's more actions in this one.BTW, the hooker from next door isn't what you'd call a good person. She just adds some spice to the movie and doesn't stray too far from what you'd expect.See it if you have nothing better to do or just want to feel smart about your cinema instincts."
3,A little too melancholy...,I own this CD and bought it for the first couple songs but it gets really depressing on a long listen.
2,Disappointing,"I really had looked forward to this disc, having heard a couple tracks off an online radio station. Unfortunately, track three is pretty much the strongest one, and while a few of the others are tolerable, the disc has rarely made it back into my player.I think it's just too out there for me to enjoy."
1,Anything but uplifting,"I bought this CD on the strength of customer reviews. Boy, was I sorry. Easy listening it is, without complexity or depth, and depressing to boot. I found it superficial and irritating. The only use for it I can think of is to calm a child. But there's more lovely and inspiring music out there to do that job, Enya, for instance. I actually bought an extra CD to give my Dad as a gift, and I cannot think of one person I know who might like it."
2,a bit disappointing,"I bought the CD based on customer reviews, but it didn't seem like they got to the real essence of the music. It sounds to me like it's mostly sad (depressing almost), wistful movie music. I prefer to listen to more upbeat background music.. I ended up deleting the album from my iPod."
1,Complain,Unfortunately I haven`t received the CD.It is the second time you try to send it to me and I don`t get it. It is paid you have my money from American Express but I don`t have any product.What`s happening in your organization...???I want my CD NOW. Maria
1,huh.....?,"i bought this cd & ""white stone"" at the same time thinking their music might help me to relax during my exam period,but both turned out to be so artifical & imitative & all-too-common that bored me to death instead of soothing me.i sold it right away, i'd rather listen to those classic ""best of piano pieces"" or ""moonlight album "",at least they're written by real genius musicians like Chopin ."
5,Enchanting Music for all.,I love the music. It is so moving and so deep. It really stirs up your feeling. My 6-year old son was moved by the music when first hear it.
4,Celtic New Age-strong on melody,"If you like Enya, Celtic New Age music, and John William's/John Barry movie music, this will become a favorite of yours. The production is excellent. It won't do for ambient music, however, since it is strong on melody and predictable after a few listens. Pleasant, nice dinner or lazy-Sunday music."
4,Excellent Production with Haunting Melodies,"After hearing ""Nocturne"" on a local classical station I knew I HAD to pick this CD up. ""Nocturne"" is such an incredible acheivement, and being a songwriter myself, wish I could write something half as good. With Rolf Lovland on piano and Fionnuala Sherry on violin, the music to this song makes me weep with joy. Gunnhild Tvinnereim, the featured vocalist on ""Nocturne"", has one of the purest voices I have ever heard. The rest of the CD is almost as beautiful, and has the underpinings of both Norwegian and Celtic culture. Many times, listening to this fabulous music, I can picture myself on a cliff overlooking the wide, expansive Atlantic ocean, and each song brings to mind a different atmosphere to become part of."
5,Adorable,"These songs have brought me to life and awaken my lost spirit in my secret garden; the spirit which I have lost when my fiancée has left me. Thanks to the people who has composed, played and sung those secrets..."
5,"An all out cry of joy from the human spirit, exceptional","This musics will lift your heart and send your troubles away. The melodies wrap you in a warm blanket and send you on a journey of wonderment. It is a must hear, and a must have for anyones collection."
3,Unwinding & Soothing,This is a nice Cd. Its a combination of New Age & Celtic music.I'll often play it when I'm looking for pieces of music to helpelliviate the steel bands of high stress. If I have had difficultysleeping its soothing enough for me to use that will help tostart shutting internal systems off.
5,VERY RELAXING,"After reading all the reviews ,I found those that didn't anything good to say about ""SONGS FROM A ""SECRET GARDEN"" need instructions on how to RELAX! I love ENYA and when I found SECRET GARDEN,I knew I had found the same type of beautiful relaxing music! You can't compare the two,you have to listen to"" SECRET GARDEN "" as though you have never heard of ENYA!! I love ""SECRET GARDEN"" for their own relaxing qualities!!!!!"
3,Not as good as it seems,"At first listening, I liked this CD quite a lot. Upon repeated listenings, however, I found it to be repetitive and uninspiring. It is good background music, but it is as if each track has a 'movie soundtrack' soundbyte theme to it. Good only if you really like New Age style music."
3,Pretty good considering it's mostly instrumental,"The CD is pretty good for it's kind. It's soothing, tranquil, peaceful and calming, but I prefer vocals myself (I'm a huge Loreena McKennitt fan) so I was hoping for more the first time I listened to it.I read many reviews before I purchased this CD, but nobody really mentioned the fact that it was mostly just instrumental; so I want to mention that fact for future would-be buyers of this CD."
5,Absolutely Relaxing,I basically ordered this CD accidently when I ordered two CD's by Vanessa Mae. I still don't quite know how I did it but when I got the CD I was so glad I received it. This has got to be one of the best CD's I have ever owned. No matter how bad my day went this will bring me down to a very relaxed level. It is a beautiful CD.
5,beautiful cd,"This cd is lovely.The music is occasionally haunting,and always calming. We use it at my workplace as background music and everyone enjoys it."
3,Engaging but ultimately simplistic,"After seeing several CD's in the best seller list, I decided to give this group a shot. I found the mix of folk Irish, classical and new age to be quite engaging with the harmonies on several songs to be quite beautiful. However, in listening to all the tracks, I was somewhat dissapointed in the lack of musical depth. Each song seemed to run on the same formula and by the end of the CD, it was just too predictable. As a mix of styles, it's worth at least listening to as good background music or music to fall asleep by."
4,Songs from a Secret Garden,"I found my own Secret Garden through these beautiful, enchanting songs that are inspiring, uplifting, mesmerizing, and transforming. It takes me to a place within my heart that touched my inner soul, and opened it up to engulf the joys and sorrows that we all must go through. At the same time, nourishing my spirit with the jewels of the earth and quenching my desires for expression of the beauty of our own being. I feel so at peace -- the serenity that it brings. It freshens and purifies the very air that we breathe. This transcends TIME."
5,My favorite CD!,"This is my first purchase by Secret Garden. I LOVE this CD. I turn it on everyday at dinner time. Candles, soft music... it's heaven. If I sometimes forget to turn it on, my 9 year old son does. It would be great music to fall asleep to."
2,Nonstandard Threading,"If you buy this, also be prepared to buy Meade's t-mount adaptor to go with it. The threads on the camera adaptor are off-pitch just enough to make mating with third party t-mount adaptors hit or miss. These are supposed to be standard pitch threads but they just didn't get it quite right."
1,Useless,"I got this to attach my digital SLR to my telescope. I got the correct T-mount, too. The pictures I got were horrible and useless. I'm very familiar with using manual settings on my camera and knew I'd have to do that, so that wasn't the problem. Very disappointing (and somewhat expensive) experiment."
2,bows,I ordered 3 and one of the three had imperfections in the center of the bow(small dents and voids like might normally be found in wood) . After trimming to proper length I bent the bow for installation and it broke at the imperfection. I did not try to wrap it into a circle it broke well before any excessive bend. The other two worked out fine.I was surprised that they shipped each one in a seperate tube. The packaging was poor since the bows were falling out of the tubes when they arrived.
2,Buy the Factory Nissan Manual!,"I think it is well worth the extra money to buy the factory Nissan manual. This book is fine for reference, but not as the only source of information for your Nissan. I tried to install a car stereo in my 1991 240SX and this manual didn't have the wiring diagrams to do that simple task. I also changed the accessory belts and the manual didn't have the tension specifications. Luckily my local Nissan dealer provided me with those specs. I have a Factory Nissan manual for my 1995 Pathfinder and it is considerably better. It has better pictures, more detailed text, and all the wiring diagrams. Bottom Line...Buy the factory manual (I know it costs more, but you get what you pay for!) and use this one as a way to start a fire in your fireplace."
3,"Good basic book, but not always complete","Chilton's Manual has a lot of good basic maintenance info. However, the Hayne's manual would probably be a better choice. (generally includes more helpful pictorial info and step-by-step directions for the not-so-accomplished home mechanic -- or if the vehicle is pretty new to you)Unfortunately, I was looking for information on a Stanza Wagon, and beyond that, a 4WD wagon. The Haynes ""Stanza"" manual does not include info on either of those models, while Chilton's does. (At least to a limited extent; for instance, I have yet to successfully check and/or add transmission or transfer case fluid -- the Chilton's manual contradicts itself in several different chapters, and even the dealer wasn't sure...)And, as usual, Chilton's combines info on many different models in each section, so you have to be VERY careful that you're reading about your exact model or engine before proceeding."
4,"nissan 1982-1992:stanza,200sx,240sx",i need help i have nissan 200sx turbo but i dont have manual i want to look that book and buy it if it like me this book is important
4,The Road,"I was'nt aware of this book--It was a good quick read--I think London must have been one of Jack Kerouac's many inspirations for his famous ""On The Road"" some 50+ years later."
2,Enough already!,"This is London's autobiographical tale of his life as a hobo and a part-time, although not a very loyal, member of Kelly's Army. One serious failing of this books is that London neglects to give any historical facts on this Army. Why was it created, what were its results? Instead we get very repetitious stories about riding the rails and escaping the bulls, his time in the Erie County Jail, a lot of abuse of women and children. The story's beginning is in the middle and there is no end. When did he leave the road and why? You won't find out here. To me, the only reason to read this book is if you are trying to read the entire London cannon, as I happen to be doing. With a little better organization and a lot of editing, this could have made an interesting short story."
4,A Bit Shallow,"This game has riveting action and does attempt to convey the feeling of being in the middle of the Vietnam war. What prevents it from being excellent is that it tends to be repetitive. For instance, the mission where you enter the temple to kill the hated VC general is overwrought - it's the same type of firefight over and over again. The enemy AI is good, not spectacular; they tend to march forward in a line like zombies. There were too many times when I just got tired of killing enemies. It requires some creative thought, not alot. If your only going to play one Vietnam game, play the Conflict version instead."
2,Spend your money elsewhere!,"I waited almost 4 months for this game and come to find out the missions suck and the so called ""true war"" experiance was about the most ""untrue war"" experiance I have had from any game. The only mission that was any good was the forth where you have to rescue the POW's. They also say that ""Each mission should range from 45 to 65min in length"". 10 mins on each mission is more like it! and on the subject of missions 11 only i thought it was going to be 14? terrible game, if you want to get it try renting it first you will save a few bucks!"
2,What are you looking for?,"If you are looking for something that realistically portrays being in Vietnam, then get Conflict: Vietnam.If you are looking for an arcade game, then get Shellshock.Mind you. Shellshock doesn't even re-create the Vietnam like Jungle. It looks like you are going through the woods in your local area."
1,OMG!!!! When is a good vietnam game ever going to come out?!,This game looks good. it sounds good. does it play good? NO! This game is al l about volence and bad languge. I agree with Jeff Rogers. The game is comepletely filled with retarded gameplay. ur teamates can't die no matter what. There are many games better than this one.
2,Kaz jann,Long lasting and very useful. Low energy consumption and does the job to keep the bugs away. I am glad that I got this product at low price on Amazon.
2,Looks okay but not great quality wood,"I bought this TV stand around 10 months back for my 40"" Sony LCD TV.. It looks okay.. but the wire clutters can be seen from front which kind of not look good...While I was assembling this TV stand when it arrived, somehow I felt the quality is not that good... I found cracks in the wood!Till now this TV stand hasn't been moved so its fine but I guess it might be a problem if I had to move to some other place."
2,The kindle fire version is not well adapted from the written version,"The version for Kindle version is not well adapted from the written version, a lot of times you have the screen and jiust a small part is used so this make it had to read."
2,Out of date in 2012 - don't buy!,"We normally use the Lonely Planet's main competitor, but given that this book is more recent we decided to give it a try. We bought this book in early 2012 for our trip to Peru in August 2012. We used it extensively during our trip. Most non-changeable facts and historical reviews are good, although we prefer the style of LP's main competitor.However, we consistently found out that many recommendations (opening hours, prices, addresses and hotel/restaurants) are out of date or simply wrong - there are so many differences between the book and reality that we wonder if the writers actually checked and updated the information. Don't buy this book as it is now out of date - or at least don't rely on it for prices, opening hours, and hotel/restaurants recommendations."
4,very complete,"The book is in the Lonely Planet series. They have good info, though the Lonely Planet series is not my first choice. There aren't many good tour guide books for Peru."
2,Good content terrible on the iPad/Kindle,"The content is not bad--places to go, things to do, cost of alternative options, etc. But this book is terrible to read on the iPad. There are no good pictures of places, events, or maps, and those that are included seem haphazardly thrown in. Some of the formatting is off as well, giving the feeling that your reading some 3rd rate website rather than a well researched book. Stick with the paper copy."
1,Lonely Planet Peru fails to deliver,"A lot of the information about Peru was wrong! Tickets for Machu Picchu can be reserved from the USA, and should be reserved at least a week in advance in the OFF-season. I'm not sure how far in advance they should be reserved during the high season, but we could only get tickets for 3 days later (at earliest) when we got to Peru. Also, train tickets absolutely need to be purchased in advance, contrary to the book's recommendation of one day. In addition, many of the maps were entirely incorrect, at least in Cusco. I normally like Lonely Planet (I've used them for various places in Europe and Asia), but this one was way off base."
2,This book gives a misguided impression,"I am extremely disapointed with the tone Lonely Plane has decided to take with this book. Instead of highlighting the beautiful spots, the wonderful people and overall magnificent country that Peru is - the author has decided to take a negative tone throughout the book. No side trips off the beaten track, it goes into detail describing typical tourist traps (certainly not why what one goes to LonelyPlanet looking for). Not enough recommendations for day itineraries, an overall boring read with no insightful advice on what to do. And a flat negative tone for everything else."
4,"great country, good book, watch the altitude","Peru is a remarkably interesting country. This is a pretty good guidebook. One area where the guide could be improved is advising tourists on itineraries that work up to high altitude gradually. The easiest trips to arrange go straight from Lima at sea level to sleeping in a hotel in Cusco at 11,000' above sea level. At best you won't feel good and at worst you could get acute altitude sickness. A bit of planning, however, and you can either zip straight from the airport at Cusco to Aguas Calientes below Macchu Pichu (about 8000') or work your way up to Cusco from some towns that are at 7000'. Simply by reshuffling your itinerary you can have a trip where you are feeling good and strong all the time rather than a trip where you stagger around breathlessly and suck down aspirin for the pounding headache."
3,peru slightly under water,"the material and facts are well provided and fairly well organized,butthe country deserves better then this. As one of the worlds most fasinating places, both from a human and natural perspective, this book falls short relative to providing a full view of Peru's incredable wonders, seek another source if you are looking for an informative guide or historic perspective."
4,Great guidebook,We have several Lonely Planet guides and this guide for Peru did not disappoint. It had lots of useful tips for the places we visited!
4,Handy reference.,"This little purse-sized book is a great reference, especially for those who want to see more than Lima, Machupicchu & Cuzco. There are great tips on out-of-the-way places to visit and things to see that many might otherwise miss. The book makes great pre-trip reading or just good dreaming, and there is no doubt you'll find room for it in your briefcase or backpack when you go. ..."
5,It has it all!,"I just spent two weeks in L.A looking for places to live. This street finder quickly found all the addresses I was looking for. And I could easily navigate from one place to another, even when crossing several cities."
5,COMPLETE BOOK,"This guide makes it so much easier, because in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, I would need numerous individual maps, instead of this single book."
3,"Rabbit Fur Hat, BLACK, L","The hat arrived in a short time and that was good. The quality of the hat was a litte bit on the poor side. I've since found that for around $10.00 more at JC Penney's you can get a much nicer hat of the same type.But, WHO KNEW!!"
3,SOLO PARA FANS!!,"Por ser mi grupo favorito debo tenerlo, las dos nuevas rolas están muy buenas, muy diferentes al estilo clásico de Stryper, lo que no me gustó es que repitieron varias rolas del anterior disco que también es una recopilación, así que pues es casi lo mismo, pero bueno un buen fan debe tener todos los discos."
1,Return of the bible-thumping Bee People,"This is truly a sign of the end times. The Four Bee-keepers of the Apocalypse have returned to spread the gospel of non-demonic...I mean non-denominational rock and roll. I can't believe these guys still bother when their own people think they're possessed by Ozzy Osbourne. Or is it Marilyn Manson this decade? At any rate, this'll at least give Eminem some fodder for future lyrics....."
1,Stryper has good songs ?,"You got to be kidding me! Stryper is the worst metal band... ever! Just like all other Christian metal bands these guys are posers and nothing more, dont get me wrong I am a Christian myself but it pains me to see or hear about bands like this! Using God to make money, now if that is not a sin than what is? I imagine picking out songs for this album was like choosing between vomit and crap, just like that all songs on this album have something in common: they stink! Come on give me a break, these are the guys who were throwing bibles to the people during their concerts.For good metal/ hard rock listen to:Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Tool, Alice In Chains, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, A Perfect Circle, Slayer, Queensryche, Motorhead, Megadeth, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Soundgarden, Mad Season, Jimi Hendrix, Dio, Helloween, Rainbow, Manowar, Pearl Jam, Accept, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails and Scorpions."
5,Great compilation,"Very well put together, the new songs are great (though not the traditional Stryper sound, they're somewhat Creed-like). Would have liked to see ""You Know What to Do"" on here, but for the most part I liked the songs they picked. If you're new to Stryper's music, this is a great sampling of their work. Great rock music with a ""+"" message."
4,Great compilation-new songs a little disappointing,"As a compilation, this one is much better than Can't Stop the Rock from a few years ago. It features many of the band's heavier, less commercial songs like The Way and From Wrong to Right. With this cd you also get Stryper standards like Honestly, Lady, THWTD, and Soldiers as well. The two new songs sound more like stuff Michael Sweet is doing alone now, and the lack of guitar solos was very disappointing. From the Expo videos it is obvious Oz has kept his chops up to do them, although I think that decision was probably Mike's. Overall, a great cd. Kudos to the band for including Believe which is as relevant now as it was the first time in came out in 91 when the Persian Gulf war was raging."
4,good stuff,"It's ben a long time since I've heard stryper. The new songs are ok however the vocals sound difrent, not the same sound."
1,Very disappointing,"I was very unhappy to see that half of the cans in the package were not the brand that I ordered but Instead were unnamed cans that just read ""96% beef"". I've ordered this product before and it was fine, but this time was very disappointing."
3,Good foundation but doesn't get you started.,"The book is suitable for someone like me, who has no or minimal knowledge about sewing. It provides a good introduction to the mechanism of sewing such as brief descriptions on the various types of fabrics, the various types of needlework, etc... It also comes with a lot of colourful illustrations which I find useful. However, the part on the type of fabrics may not be easy to comprehend without actually having touch them. Nevertheless, it is a good book to gain some basic knowledge on sewing.It is worth mentioning that the book does not actually get you started on sewing right away. After finishing the book, I find myself looking for other books in order to get me to start sewing. It would definitely be very good if the author can include a few simple examples to allow readers to get started on sewing. This book should not be used on its own if you intend to seriously learn how to sew (and not just some needlework)."
2,Not worth the money,"This is a poor atlas I will not buy ""Benchmark"" in the future. I bought this one because I thought it would show more (it had a newer publication date). The DeLorme Atlas and Gazetteer is much better for explorers, hikers, ghost towners, sportsment, hunters, fishermen etc."
3,Benchmark Maps,"Another fine example that there was never any mining done in Idaho. For a full review check out my Oregon and New Mexico reviews. I'm through giving money to Benchmark until they start placing their contents and legend items, actually on their maps."
5,Perfect Map,Perfect just what I expected and needed for our future travels. Nice large pictures are perfect for planning road trips.
4,Like it,I will be going back to this book as I move into to the consulting phase of my career. It helped me see that the route I have chosen is the one to take.
2,*ddiction withdrawal review,Tried this product for a couple of weeks. Didn't really notice any relief of symptoms. Thought it was a waste of money.
2,Fascinating about the legal system - does not aid the reasons one gets away in a book,"The book gives an excellent insight into the machinations and interactions of lawyers and the legal system. But the lack of a resolution detracts from the reason one escapes into books for entertainment. After reading about the inconsistencies in other reviews and editorials about the book, since I wondered if any of it was based on some facts, (I drive an Explorer, previous year of the one in the book) that I feel my car is safe. I just felt such a let down at the end. It tends to keep you interested that something ""juicy"" will happen and then your back to the dry legal interactions. So I mainly found this an entertaining form of education."
3,"So much talent, so many bad choices","There are better recordings than this of Cavalleria Rusticana. Some of the problems might be the miking, but some of the conductor's decisions are just wrong. Sinopoli knows better than this; the orchestra isn't even together sometimes. The balance is sometimes screechingly wrong (again, maybe bad miking). Placido must have been terribly nervous as he's breathing every few notes in the Siciliana--the long lines one expects simply aren't there. The performance comes across as cold and rather academic, even at its warmest and most passionate."
3,YES..... But in ........,"I read everything comments on this recording - personally I like Domingo and even more Agnès Balsta - but I find that we exaggerate on the ascendancy of this version - OK; it is on Balsta is irreproachable the most beautiful voice(vote) and the most suited for this role, but for the role of the tenor there is better; moreover meme for the recording altogether - Thus listen to the versions of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci sung by Carlos Bergonzi, cossotto fiorenza and Guelfi or for Pagliacci (Bergonzi, joan Carlyle and the sensational taddei giuseppe (the whole orchestrated by Karajan of whom often I emet of the not always favorable comments there excellent it is him who sets fire) Christian (France)"
5,Mythologyyyyyyy,"I love Mythology. Specifically Norse in this case.This book, just had it all. Every god and goddess I cared to read about. It was compact enough to fit in my hand bag, (yes my hand bag is bigger than most...and yes I carry mythological encyclopedias a round....how embarressment. :p ) For any one interested in the ancient myths from norse, classical, or celtic, this book is a one stop wonder. if it doesn't have the info you need or want, it has enough to point you in the right direction. There's also info in this book, that for whatever reason I never found else where, such as on internet sites or text book.Very in depth, easy to follow. a great read and a great purchase."
3,"Good, but not excellent, and not comprehensive","This is mostly a picture book. It is in dictionary form, with three dictionaries, one each for Classical, Celtic, and Norse myths. Many of the illustrations are lavish and excellent, including oil paintings, museum pieces, and story-book illistrations circa 1900. Other illustrations (about a third) are meritless; evidently drawn to fill up space in the book.The text covers major entries that could be found in any dictionary of mythology, but falls severely short on minor characters and places. It is also missing several obvious entries: for example 'dwarf' and 'giant' and 'troll' are missing from the Norse dictionary.The Norse dictionary includes a smattering of characters from Baltic and Finnish (Kallevalla) mythology but it is even more incomplete than the Scandenavian entries."
4,sociology of nationalism,"This is an excellent book for history and sociology students alike. Puri introduces such ideas as nations having sexual orientation, which I have never encountered before. She has a great connection to her audience for her ideas in a post 9-11 world; make no mistake- this is not an antiquated volume. If you are looking for a striking new view on nationalism- this is it."
2,not good for other mp3 players,I purchased this for a Sansa Fuze. The IceTune can be made compatible to play music from Sansa but it does not charge it. The exclusive IPod charging feature seemed under-emphasized in the description. I returned the item.
3,Ice Tune,The product offers a stackable format which cuts down on space or you can spread it out. Would prefer if it had more bass available but this type has no adjustment. The volumn is consistent up until almost max where there is distortion Purchased this mainly so that my daugher could charge up her ipod.
2,Will NOT work with 6th Generation Nano!,"I bought this to work with my 2nd generation iPod Nano and I was quite pleased with the quality. It was a bit tinny, but it's a pretty small system.Of course my Nano dropped dead right after I got it, so I bought a 6th Generation Nano this week.Well wasn't I happy to find out it doesn't work in the Macally dock. Greaaaat.So now I'm stuck with it."
1,"OK for kids, not great sound, DOES NOT WORK WITH ITOUCH OR IPHONE!","I purchased this to put on my desk at work, but after unpacking it, it didn't work with my iphone or my itouch. It does work with my much older ipod, but the sound quality isn't the greatest. It's great for my 10 year old for in her room because she can't turn it up too loud or it starts to sound bad.So, for the price, it's good for a young kid who might not notice sound quality, but that's about it.They need to update the description for this item so everyone is aware it doesn't work with the ipod touch or iphone."
1,Didn't work with my Ipod,I sent this product back because it doesn't work with my Ipod 8GB. They don't mention this in the sales ad.
1,Won't work,"I cannot get it to work. Little blue light comes on...but no sound and no charge. Will have to look for another one. Anyone have any ideas,,,or do you think I am doing something wrong..any advice will be appreciated."
4,good speakers,they have great sound and work great for charging and that is what i wanted so i love them but the are not as loud as i wanted but they still do have a good amount of volume.
2,Good sound... bad stack,I wanted a docking system with speakers that I could take to work. I felt like the cords were all over the place. One to go to each speaker and one for the plug. No battery option either. When stacked the unit was pretty unstable. It fell over and apart (and my ipod feel off the dock) when I barely touched it. Though the sound quality was pretty good it lacks an AM/FM tuner which come on most other dock/speaker combos for around this price. Traded mine in for a more stable and solid system with AM/FM tuner for a few more dollars.
1,don't buy this! not as advertised!!,"I bought this for my ipod nano. I plugged my nano into it and an error message came on the screen: charging on this device is not supported.In addition, no sound came out of the speakers. It's as if the thing wasn't plugged into anything, it refused to recognize my ipod - no charge, no sound.I'm returning this product after owning it for only 2 hours.EDIT: After speaking with the returns department for Tiger Direct, on behalf of Comp USA, I found out that this is ONLY compatible with the first generation iPod Nano and NOT ALL IPODS like it is stated on the Amazon page. They said that this is clear on their OWN page at Comp USA, though."
1,"Bad sound, occasionally destroys iPods by overcharging","The sound quality is rather mediocre, tinny and without definition. That's ok, though; it's still more than good enough for kids or background music. What isn't ok, is the fact that these destroy iPods by overcharging them. Ours killed two iPods before we figured out what is happening.If you buy one of these DO NOT leave the iPod in it for too long. There seems to be a problem with the charging circuit on these, and it may overcharge your iPod. The resulting overheating may destroy the screen, if not more, and will definitely damage the battery. As I said, we've had two screens damaged by leaving an iPod charging in one of these, so I'm fairly confident this device is to blame."
2,Tech Details Incorrect - NOT COMPATIBLE w/ IPOD TOUCH,"I purchased this based off of it's Technical Details stating ""Compatible with all versions of the iPod, including the iPod mini"".In our family we have one Ipod Shuffle and two Ipod touches. This did not work with either versions of our iPods. The Ipod touch had a box pop up saying it is not compatible. Our Ipod touches are not clones or some black market items. We purchased them directly from Apple on-line...same with the shuffle.I can't really rate the sound of this product because I do not know.NOT COMPATIBLE W/IPOD TOUCH OR SHUFFLE."
4,MACALLY IceTune Stereo Speaker and Charger MACALLY IceTune Stereo Speaker and Charg,"It works as advertised. The sound is pretty good for the price. It is very compact and can be stacked so it doesn't take up much room (when stacked, it is about the size of a 2 liter bottle of soda)."
3,ok....for the price,This is a good speaker/ipod dock system for an open office. The sound quality is a little high on the treble with out much bass support but for the price you can't complain. It's nice being able to position the speakers differently and being able to connect your computer through them it allows for me to drop my computer speakers and reduce the clutter. I would recommend this to somebody who wants to not spend much money on a compact iPod sound system and is not concerned with having great sound quality.
1,do NOT buy,"so disappointing! Not only did it not charge the i-pod nano (the speakers did work but when tried to charge - ""charging not supported with this accessory"" on the i-pod) but the small round pads on the speakers bases left PERMANENT stains on our furniture. False advertising and expensive repairs required."
3,Use with Caution,"This useful work presents some facts and many theories. The late Professor John Chadwick (of Cambridge) personally told me that the authors are a bit wild. Nevertheless, the book contains some thought provoking propositions and the authors do attempt to verify their theories. The volume is adequately illustrated. I especially liked chapter 3 ""The Cretan Branch of Luwian Hieroglyphic"". courtesy of Mr. Gary S. Dykes"
2,Not what I was expecting,"If you're looking for a comprehensive guide on setting up a Postfix mail server, then this isn't the book for you. For those that are already familiar with setting up MTAs, the information provided in ""The Definitive Guide"" is probably enough, but this book only covers a subset of the Postfix configuration parameters and does not provide the step-by-step instructions that many people may be expecting."
4,A useful book,"This is a good resource and a nice compliment to ""Plants Of The Pacific Northwest Coast"" by Pojar & Mackinnon. The one feature missing in this book is the individual plant range maps. Those are a useful part of ""Plants Of The Pacific Northwest Coast"" and their addition would improve this book.The book does a very good job of covering the plants on the eastern side of the Cascade mountains. The climates are so different on opposite sides of the mountains that NW outdoorspersons really need to have both books."
5,good guide,"had it for class and it was helpful. some of the time you had to go either use the genus and species name and other that wouldn't work so common is better found, but you never know which is needed."
5,heart felt romance,"I loved the book and it made me want to watch the movie more than ever.I'm currantly doing a book report on ""Never Been Kissed"" and if you have any information on Cathy East Dubowski then please post it here and I will thank you for ever and ever"
5,Nice Movie with a Nice Writing of a Novel,"This is actually the best novelization of a movie I've ever read! I've read so many novels of movies after I've seen them, but I was somehow disappointed by the ""weird"" stuff that appeared in the novels. This one.. this one is totally different from those I've read before! Basically the author kept lots of stuff from the screenplay, even some little conversation, but she omitted some scenes in order to make more sense because I found the movie quite confusing... well, not that confusing... (okay.. I don't want to give out the ending just in case there's a person who hasn't seen this awesome movie) I laughed and... even cried while I was reading this book! It's enchanting and powerful! I like the Josie in the movie, and I like the Josie in the book!"
5,The book and film were incredible.,"However, since I'm a fan of Jeremy Jordan (who ended up liking her in the end), I wish she could have (I know it was impossible). But both kept me interested and laughing the entire time."
1,baddddd,"the product is bad and to make it clear on what exactly is writen on the box i recived on the top of the back of the box it says in a clear green color ""FOR ENTERTAINMENT USE ONLY"" and on the bottom side of the back of the box it says in black ""THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE SOLD OR PROMOTED AS AN EAR CANDLE. IT IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE USED OR SOLD AS A MEDICAL DEVICE AND IS NOT REGULATED OR EVALUATED BY THE FDA"" also it smells very bad and as a customer i have all the right in the world to say how i grade this product!!!"
1,seems like a cheat.,The description said there are 4 sticks of candles and there were just 2 when the package came. The shipping was in bad condition and late. I will recommend to spend some more money and buy it from someone else.
1,waste of money!!!,"this product is a HOAX! do not waste your money or time on this product. the wax that you get inside the candle after is only a byproduct of the burnt candle and has nothing to do with what is in your ear. to test this, i burnt a candle in the air and didn't insert it in my ear.. not surprised at all, i got the exact same results as when i had the candle in my ear. who would've guessed. don't buy this."
1,SCAM!!!!,"I would give this 1 star if possible. These ear candles (and all ear candles) DO NOT DO ANYTHING!!! It is a proven fact, if you just let one burn you get the same amount of ""wax"" as you do when you put it in your ear and burn it. The stuff in it after it is burnt is just a byproduct of the candle burning. Please save your money for something that actually works. STAY AWAY!!! Look into it if you dont believe me!"
5,Alli Artisti,"Paganini's masterwork is dedicated 'Alli Artisti', meaning the listeners, not the players. Paganini himself never gave public performance of his work. And rightly so. Frequently, their performance is mistakenly judged on brilliance of sound, speed, 'eclat', or artifact: public effect. It should not be so. Accardo' s performance is among the very few making justice to this masterwork. Technically it is perfect,clean,sober. Mastery of the instrument allows his intimate understanding of the music to emerge, and reach the listener. The hidden, 24-faceted gem is discreetly uncovered."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I was slightly dissapointed by this recording. Accardo is famous for his Paganini recordings and interpretations. . . his recording of the 6 violin concertos with Charles Dutoit only prove that claim. However, these caprices aren't what I expected. The technique is spotty and inconsistent, particularly with the chords and double-stops. Also, the intonation is pretty unreliable and the articulation is clumsy. For anyone buying a recording of these caprices, I would recommend the Kaler, Mintz, Ehnes, or Perlman recordings before considering the Accardo. For the Accardo fans out there, go buy his recording of Paganini's 6 violin concertos with Dutoit. Now here is where Accardo redeems himself as one of the greatest performers of Paganini."
4,24 Caprices of Paganini with S. Accardo,"Salvatore Accardo has a phenomenal technique but is not such a superlative interpretator. I think, though, this recording of the 24 Caprices of Paganini is a bit below his best efforts. I was impressed that he takes a faster tempo in the No. I than R. Ricci does in his 1947 remastered recording. I was generally pleased with this CD but was disappointed with his playing of the more colorful studies like No. IX in E major and No. XVII in E flat. I didn't really appreciate the mushy articulations in No. IX in the beginning as it is supposed to be played in a more spirited style with lighter staccato in the opening fanfare, which has the idiomatic 3rds, 5ths and 6ths. I was surprised to find such a sleepy approach to the famous No. XXIV, which climaxes the set. It lacked brilliance and seemed loggy. Overall I liked this CD but was disappointed with salient details."
4,"very good, but a little long","My wife and I lead kids church, 3 to 5 years olds. I use the 13 set of these DVDs and children are glued. The Christmas and Easter presentation DVD are a little long, and nearly all the children lost interest. Also, much of the footage in these two DVD's are repeats from the 13 set of the StoryKeepers. The StoryKeepers is a must set to have. Buy the way, there is a StoryKeeper App at a much lower price."
1,Presumed Innocent,A splendid novel but dreadful Kindle edition. It is filled with errors. A very poor editing job on the part of the publisher.
2,Wasn't that thrilled,"Listened to this as audiobook as I do most books. Though many of the reviews are flattering, I simply didn't think that much of it. Had to wait for the very end for a hint of any suspense. Ready to move on to the next read."
1,Tedious!,"I started reading the book full of expectation. After the first hundred pages or so, I could not take the slow pace and multiple digressions with the occasional sexual references (probably to keep readers going) any longer.The plot is simple: make everybody a suspect; include the basic sleaze, power and money ingredients; and end up with the least suspect of all characters as the guilty one.To make the whole thing more palatable, a couple of hundred pages would have been more decent."
1,Read only if you like your reading material cryptic.,"I find this book difficult to read because of the style of writing. Unlike novelists David Baldacci, Brad Meltzer, Mike Lawson or countless other storytellers, it does not flow smoothly and the reader must slog through more than 150 pages before the story begins in earnest. It appears as if the writer is simply trying to fill the pages with maudlin descriptions of everything in the character's world. And those descriptions ramble on -- sometimes for an entire chapter -- with no better understanding of where all this is taking the reader. I will not read anymore of Scott Turow's fiction because it is just too intense and difficult to try to read."
5,At the top of legal thriller chain,"One word - outstanding. This legal thriller will leave you spinning with surprise, even though all the clues have been carefully planted along the way. The plot has many turns, yet holds together nicely. It is simply one of the best and most imaginitive novels written."
3,Quite good,"The book is interesting, but bogs down on several occasions through long diversions that could have been condensed. I guessed who the murderer was long before the answer was revealed, although I certainly didn't figure out all the details about how the deed was done. Worth reading, but not the best mystery I've read."
2,My first and last Scott Turow book,A chore to read. I picked it up to read on a long flight to China. Next time I'll reread something by Steinbeck or Sinclair Lewis. Outcome was predictable from the mid way point. I only finished it because I can't read Chinese and needed to pass time somehow or other
2,Linear and predictable,"This was written by an attorney that in my opinion spent too much time on the nuance and mechanics of courtroom procedure and too little time developing a multi level story.The ending is good but I predicted it based on the authors over the top treatment in describing his relationship with a character.It's mostly boring, linear, one dimensional story telling but if you can plod through it you are rewarded at the end."
5,Impressive,"I'm cynical. I'd thought I'd seen it all in crime fiction until I read this and found how perfect a courtroom drama built around a compelling mystery could be. This is not only a riveting thriller, but excellent fiction. Critics who proclaimed this a groundbreaking work were spot on."
2,Female Characters--SPOILER ALERT!,"One woman in this book is portrayed as a dangerous, sexual being (who is murdered, of course). The other women is the loyal housewife who is willing to kill ""the other woman"" to protect her husband. In fact, that seems to be the only meaningful interaction between the two female characters. In these types of books/movies, women have no agency of their own; they only exist in relation to a man---just like ""Fatal Attraction."" Come on, Mr. Turow!"
5,best bet on Turow,"Unlike 1L and Burden of Proof, two other books written by Turow, this book has it all. Adventure with a great twist in the end. For some who may read this, it might be considerd ""justice."" Just like fatal attraction, the affair never ends well."
1,disappointed,"There are few books I never finish; this was one. I was not ""gripped"" by this ""thriller"", got tired of the language and sent it to the thrift store."
2,Disappoint airport literature,"If you were looking for great literature, you've come to the wrong place. This is a book for those who are merely searching for thrills. The author fails to make you think about the nature of the system or of human nature. The novel is full of common places and sentences that pretend to be poetic and are merely corny. But I must admit that this terribly flawed novel is very readable. The plot is certainly imaginative, though not terribly credible. The actors lack any depth and are simply caricatures of human beings. But, perhaps because of curiosity about the ending, I could not put it then. I wouldn't recommend it to any serious reader. And I do not intend to keep my copy."
2,Presumed BORING,"Funny how Hollywood can turn a seemingly DULL book into an engaging, exciting movie. Here's one example that stands out from the rest. Turow's writing is as boring and lifeless as a legal brief. Not surprising, when you consider that he's a lawyer-turned writer.Turow's characters are 2-dimensional, with very little redeeming value. I found myself sympathizing with NONE of them. My interest in the characters as a whole made this book a tedious read (not to mention all the internal dialogue that went on within certain characters).If you MUST read this book, don't spend money on it. Borrow it from your local library.Better yet...don't waste the time READING...just watch the MOVIE (starring Harrison Ford, Raul Julia, Brian Dennehy, etc. etc.).Peace Out."
1,Explicit sex,"I am writing this review for those who don't care for explicit sex in novels. I'm sure there are much more graphic novels than this, but I didn't finish this one because of the detailed sexual descriptions. Needless to say, since I didn't finish it I can't rate the novel on its merits. If you don't mind the sex, you might enjoy this. If you do mind, skip this novel."
1,Turgid prose,"I left this book on the seat of the plane after reading four chapters. Boring and barely literate, this book is a waste of time for all but hardcore thriller completists."
5,Turow's Best,"Who killed Carolyn? That is the question that unravels the life and career of her seceret lover, Rusty Sabich. A gripping page-turner, with lots of plot twists make this book a very entertaining read. Much better than the movie version."
3,Good courtroom drama,"This is my first Scott Turow book and I enjoyed it. I guessed the ""who done it"" way too early in the book, but there are enough angles to make it interesting and keep you second guessing. The court room dialogue was great. This book was written before DNA testing, which makes it a little more mysterious."
4,Solid Legal Thriller,"Well-written, fast-moving legal thriller. Nothing all that deep, but very entertaining. It's difficult to come across a thriller that isn't predictable, but this one did it."
1,"Plagiarized recipes, Many false claims.","Maecel Biro and his ex wife, Shannon Kring made sweeping claims about their 'businesses' and Biro's past. They plagiarized recipes and procedures from a cooking school's cookbook and PBS show plus school curriculum, Ecole de Cuisine, in Wisconsin, where Biro was employed for a short time until being let go."
4,Paperback edition does not cover Landmark Forum,"Like others, I found the book useful, particularly for case studies and as a general introduction. I was unimpressed by the rather vague characterization of the differences between mainstream schools of thought (military, religious etc.) and cults as the Authors identify them - I'm left with the idea that she's particularly concerned with not attacking deeply rooted beliefs and patriotic feelings, but the analysis of the difference - if there really IS a difference - is largely unconvincing. It is important to notice that the treatment of Large Group Awareness Training (LGAT) programs is incomplete in the paperback edition, due to a pending cause with Landmark Education. All references to the widespread (and wealthy enough to stop just about anyone) Landmark Forum have been removed. So if you want her description and analysis of it, you'll need to get the hardback edition."
2,Margaret Singer Wants to Think For Us,"Entertaining reading in that it gives us insight into Singer's twisted mind. In this book Margaret Singer continues her hackneyed crusade against those who do not think like her (and thank the lucky stars they don't!). She comes from the dying CULT of psychology. The seudo-science that has been pretending to have answers. Singer has no answers. She just tries to make us fear those ""CULTS"". 50 years ago it would have been ""Communists in Our Midst"". One bio of Singer says ""Singer stands alone in her extraordinary knowledge of the psychology of cults..."". I agree. She stands totally alone! By reading this book I managed to glean more about Singer's bizarre psychology than about cults. Singer has made a career of witch hunts against cults. Sounds like she might be a little insecure. The end goal of course is to chain us to the ""cult of psychology"". If we don't think like her and the psychology party line then we're DANGEROUS. Well, pardon me if I don't agree"
1,psycologist...obviously!,notice that the person who wrote this book is a psychologist!Emphasise on that fact.
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this tea kettle about 6 months ago. After only 6 months, the exterior finish looks HORRIBLE! It looks like it is rusting on the outside. In addition, when it boils and I pour my water into my teacup, the water pops on the way out of the spout all over my counter. It also gets too hot to touch without a hot pad holder.When I bought this tea kettle, I was looking for something inexpensive and nice looking, what I got was a cheap piece of junk. On a positive note, the whistle works well."
3,"Great Photos, Misleading Discription","The calendar has wonderful photos of origami art. If you're buying for the art, you're in luck, If you're buying for patterns to the art, you're out of luck."
3,Over priced...,definitely over priced for what this vest is. There was no paperwork in the box when I received it. Decided to keep it anyways.
5,Bolle essential vest,"This is a comfortable and attractive way to add a light layer. Perfect for any activity from tennis, to walking to golf. I have one in red and one in blue...wish Bolle made one in pale yellow!"
1,The Samba is not for Dancing,"Although these are the warhorses ofthe samba,the tempo is too fast todance to. This cd would be moreappropriate for an elevator."
4,The Best Tip of the Schoenberg,"I'm not much of a fan of Schoenberg, other than what he accomplished as an arranger -- e.g., the orchestration of Brahms' Piano Quartet No. 1 -- and about the only original music by him that I care for is contained on this particular disc, music that is well-played by the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. If like me you're not a whole lot into this composer but would like to experience him, this release is an excellent first step. Find a good copy of this out-of-print album at a reasonable price and take a chance."
3,My review,Book is very well written. Two complaints:1) there are no illustrations. The pictures were all black and white and very old. I would have liked to see illustrations of baiting techniques like a start to finish illustration of rigging a dead eel. Also no mention or review of using clams as bait? Would have liked a more in depth review of casting techniques ect.2) About half the book is old fisherman stories. While somewhat entertaining this is not what I bought the book for.All in all it is a good book. Worth the money but not more than the current selling price.
2,Wrong Name: Should Be Called Anti-Globalization,"Manfred B. Steger fails at providing an introduction to the topic known as globalization. This book starts out looking like a basic explanation of what globlization is and why it is happening. However it quickly turns into a tirade about how ""bad"" globalization is and how it is a U.S. plot of some sort. I am disapointed with this book becuase I was looking for easy to read basic pro vs con explanation. Steger also discusses some advanced topics which he may not explain correctly or completely. All of his arguments or either anti-globlization or extreme anti-globlization. Steger goes as far to say what Bin Laden does is good becuase is slows the globilization process."
4,LOVE THOSE KIDS,"AFTER HEARING ALL THE BAD THINGS MY FRIENDS HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE ""SOUTH PARK"" SHOW I HAD TO SEE AND HEAR FOR MYSELF. I FOUND TWO VHS TAPES IN THE ""BARGIN BIN"" AT MY LOCAL VIDEO RENTAL STORE -CHICKEN LOVER/IKE'S WEE WEE AND CONJOINED FETUS LADY/THE MEXICAN STARING FROG OF SHRI LANKA. AND AFTER VIEWING THESE TAPES FOR THE FIFTH TIME I WAS HOOKED. I THEN BOUGHT THE MOVIE, WHICH IS ABSOLUTLY HILIARIOUS. I NOW HAVE TO BUY THE REST OF THE TAPES AS I DO NOT GET COMEDY CENTRAL IN MY CABLE PACKAGE. I HAVE BEEN ""SOUTH PARKED"" AND I LOVE IT - KEEP THEM COMING!"
4,Great Stool,"I purchased 4 Barstools. It took me 30 min to put the first one together. Than of course less time each one after that. So not too bad or difficult. So far, very sturdy and durable. We have hardwood floors and so far no scratches."
4,Swivel Bar Stool,Received 2 bar stools very quickly. Took less then an hour to put together both. Appears to be great value.
5,Good chairs for the money,"Great chair for the money. They come dissembled so grab your love one and a screw driver and put them together. Everything is great quality, they are sturdy, solid wood i believe, the the staining of the wood could of been much better (I'm anal about perfection) but overall good quality."
1,DISAPPOINTED,ALL THE SCREWS BECAME LOOSE AFTER 2 MONTHS OF USE.EVERY TWODAYS I HAVE TO TIGHTEN THE SCREWS.LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. I HARDLY USE THIS NOW.ASSEMBLY WAS EASY
3,mr,"I ordered one stool, you sent and charged for 2. i can not find your phone number on your site to tell you that i want to return one still in box and get full credit. Before I got 2, I tried my best to cancel one by sending E-mails as cancelling on site was not possible.I am afraid to order more in case i again get 2 pieces, one going to my Maryland home another to my Florida home.after assembling with all the power that i had and bad allen screw drive, the stoll screws became loose after 5 days use. i had to re assemble entire stoll, retighten all screw with loctite purchased for sear with a hope that it will not become loose again."
2,Not comfortable for the average butt.,My husband's butt is average and mine is a bit bigger than average (that's all I'm going to admit) and we both think this chair is very uncomfortable. I felt like I was going slide off of it. It's a very attractive looking chair and I now use it for decor. My stuffed toy gorilla with a small butt sits on it.
4,good swivel/small seat,The chairs look great and seem well constructed - I am keeping them - but I wish the seat was larger... had a bigger diameter.
5,Blood Sisters was awesome!,I could harldy put this book down! I had to force myself to stop reading it! Definately one of M. Carlson's best! A heartwarming novel covering important subjects such as racism and how to deal with the issues (put a stop to it!). An overall great book that I recommend to anyone!
4,Change of Pace - well written,"After reading a couple of Melody Carlson's other books - Blood Sisters was a surprising change of pace. Well written, tackling the elephant in the living room of American culture - racism. Sunday worship time is still the most segregated hour in America and while some stereotypes were used in her book (I was raised by a southern Christian mama and definitely wasn't allowed to consider anyone different due to skin color) - she did a good job of shining a light on a problem while telling a compelling story of loss, fear and redemption - kinda the trifecta of story telling. Worth the read -yes as other reviewers have noted- a few of the unfortunate e-book mistakes we seem to find . A word to those who insist on reviewing Christian fiction and complaining about the faith element - don't bother complaining - this book is true to the genre and admirably well done!"
4,Minor eBook flaws,"While the story was gripping and combined a severely depressed mother/widow's return to hope and Christian faith, the eBook version...at least on Kindle Paperwhite...had minor annoyances. The editor put extra blank lines between paragraphs, making the text rather thin during short-paragraph conversations, and there were occasional extra paragraph-breaks in mid-sentence, making the text suddenly appear with gaps that your eye had to bridge."
1,Many errors and contrived,"The story started off well though there were several spelling errors; however, by the half way point, the ""Christian"" point of view became more preaching than story telling. Because I really liked the premise of the story, tolerance vs racism, I kept trying to get past the preaching but finally gave up."
3,money money money,"I paid eighty dollars for my pair on Black Friday, but even at that appealing price point I am not sure if I will keep them or not.These little speakers put out an amazing amount of bass...and not much else. Despite their impressive weight, these speakers' midrange and treble are both pretty lacking---muddy or non-existent, at turns. And since I already have a powered subwoofer, all that nice bass is kind of useless.As rear surround speakers, maybe they'll do."
3,The only flavor we both don't like...,"Love the Coffee Masters coffee but this is the only flavor that both my husband and myself dislike. Doesn't mean it isn't any good or that other's won't like it.I have purchased many different flavors of the Coffee Masters ground coffee. They are the best I have ever found. Also discovered that they make a really awesome iced coffee on a hot day. I just make a pot, let it cool and put it in the fridge. Just throw some ice in a glass and add sugar and cream to taste. Everyone has a favorite flavor and that is just a matter of personal preference."
5,"De la Rosa Peanut Mazapan Candy, 30 package",I like this product. It is a good product. I will buy this again. I like this product. It is a good product. I will buy this again.
1,Peanut butter with your Powdered sugar,"I read a review that stated that these taste like the inside of a peanut butter cup, only a little sweeter. They do not. They have the consistency of what you would find in a peanut butter cup, but not the taste. Another reviewer said these taste just like Mexican wedding cake cookies. This is actually the review that sold me on getting these. They do not taste like that either. I think the consistency is what sold these reviewers on the response that they give. I will admit that the consistency is fun, it's crumbly, and makes it seem more appealing, the flavor is in no way appealing to me.What these do taste like is a mix between powdered sugar and the faintest hint of peanut butter. The powdered sugar overwhelms this product and is not appealing to my taste buds. If you like eating powdered sugar than you will probably enjoy these. I am sure there is a market out there for these confections, I just would not purchase these again, nor can I recommend them."
4,"Really, offering a lot...",The great title is not fake. Huge coverage of different cinema eras and national cinemas. In depth explanations of film staff. I found everything what i needed to see about world cinema.
5,Excellent reference,"This is an excellent reference source for the expert and lover of world cinema. It is complete and authoritative. All genres are well discussed, and the chronology is superb."
4,Good for beginners,Good book to learn the basics of wet on wet oil painting. Easy to understand instructions. Good for anyone just starting out in this technique.
1,are you kidding me?,"I read some lousy reviews about this template set, but I figured for $4 on sale it would be worth a try. Wrong!!! It was a waste of money. This must be the world's worst template set. Basically unuseable. When assembled correctly, the bushing runs into the rim on the side of the jig before it hits the lettering guide of the template on the outside edge. I made my own router setup to get around that problem, but still, the design is lousy and the letters don't look good. Buy some nice carving gouges instead."
5,Good Product For The Price,You get what you paid for. I found it to be a great product for the price.
2,"Not very usable, even for the low price","I didn't expect a high end tool for this price, but this is practically useless. Trying to lower a spinning router bit through the very small letter template without chewing up the side of the template is nearly impossible, and one slip and your letter template is chewed up, as are 2/3's of the ones I tried to use. I should have put the 7 bucks towards one of the better sign template sets."
2,pretty chincy,receiver product as promised. The item looks very cheaply made. It appears that after on use that it will be ready for the trash bin. I still have not used it. I'm waiting for the opportunity when the need arises to carve out some message in wood. Until then I can only comment on the appearance and quality of workmanship. Neither of which is very impressive.
1,Sew D'Lite Supreme Portable Sewing Machine 11401,"This machine is made in China and comes with no instructions. There is a cryptic chart pasted to the top of the machine. I was able to figure out the threading sequence, but the throat plate was loose. There are no instructions for positioning the throat plate. It seems to need the needle holder and presser foot removed in order to reposition the throat plate, but the screw holding them is so soft it will not unscrew without destroying the fitting.The drop in bobbin has a little chart for the correct alignment of the thread: counterclockwise or clockwise. x or o. What does that mean? Is it + or 0?I have no idea.I have searched in vain on line for instructions for this machine without success."
4,This Sew D'Lite Supreme sewing machine is lightweight.,"This machine worked well for me new out of the box. It is a cheap and inexpensive way to teach a child to sew. Great for small stitch repairs, smaller projects. It is not a real sewing machine but it has it purposes, such as teaching and small quick repairs. 4 stars!"
1,*Sigh*,"Their first and second albumz were tha bomb..what happened here?..I mean their first two albumz, tha beat, tha rythm, their flow etc..were just unbelievable!..I'm such a fan of the old ""702""..This album just killed everything..I mean they really went commercial on this..702 really started making their songz like they are nowadayz..so they could sell!..they shoulda stuck with their original style..well anyway all I can say is *sigh*.."
1,And One More Thing!,"and one more thing..the only song on here that was good was ""I'm Wit It""..that song really stuck with their original style!!!!"
3,702 What Happened??,"I give this one three star only because I did not like that song they had out called ""Star"" but overall their album was pretty good..I was expecting a lil more cause they was gone for a while after they recorded their 2nd album but their are a few good tracks on here..I prefer they 1st & 2nd album over this."
4,Beautiful,"At first I was ready to slam this third CD... but I had to pace myself. 702's CD has a nice little vibe to it! It's seductive and raw! Most of the beats on there are out of this world, but it's the lyrics that I had to listen to. FEELINGS (Mario ""Yellow Man"" Winans) and I STILL LOVE YOU (Pharell Williams) are two of many songs that just have the smoothest lyrics and the tightest beats!To make a long story short... so many songs... so many life encounters shine on the songs... WHY IS EVERYONE SLEEPING ON THIS ALBUM? Why haven't we heard from our Vegas princesses??? Put ""I STILL LOVE YOU"" as the next single! That would get their attention!COOL ALBUM!FAV SONGS (in order):FEELINGSI STILL LOVE YOUCERTIFIEDPLACESTROUBLESTARBETCHA SHEBETTER DAY"
3,Baby I'm A Star,"This album is good but it's definately not as good as 702's 2nd album. I don't know what happened, maybe different producers or songwriters? Their 2nd album was magical but this one seemed to be lacking something. I did like the songs ""Star"", ""Blah, Blah, Blah"", ""I Still Luv U"" and ""Certified"". ""Come and Knock On My Door"" has strange elements of the ""Three's Company"" theme, who knows what they were thinking but overall I though this album was average and didn't flow as well as their 2nd. 702 still rocks the beat but YO!! spend a little more time on the tracks next time."
4,"Star, this album ""shines""!",This album is great. It's different from their previous albums. A lot has changed with this album. Meelah's voice has got a little bit raspy. This time they didn't use Missy. I like the collaboration with the Neptunes.The stand out tracks:Star feat. ClipseTroubleFeelingsI still Love YouCertifiedPlacesStringing Me AlongNo WayBlah Blah Blah BlahBetcha SheBetter Day(ghetto girl)JealousyI'm Wit It
3,"Some explanation, mostly equations","The title should give it away, but this book is more on giving you the equations you need rather than giving explanations. That is not to say that the equations are not there. They are, but there are less than other books in the series.This is also not the typical book in the series because there are no problems for you to check your understanding of the equations. This seems to be intended more for a reference. What is helpful, however, is the list of references at the end of each chapter.The main topics covered here are fluid mechanics, elasticity, electromagnetic theory, and dynamics. Since this is more of a reference, I would not recommend this if you are learning the information for the first time."
2,Unworthy of Her Subject,"This isn't writing, it's cataloging. The worse kind of '..and then she did X, and then she did Y, and than she did Z.' sort of prose along with occasional dollops of armchair psychobabble. Painful and unengaging. The strength of this book is when it talks about her songs, the origins, their appeal to the broad public, and the extensive excerpting of lyrics. But be warned, you need to know French. There is no English translation here.If you're just looking for the lurid details of Ediths incredibly colorful, burn at both ends life, you will be disappointed. Discretion, or tact or possibly the threat of legal action has left names unnamed and affairs such as the one with Dietrich dropped altogether."
4,"As a ""lay student"" of copyright, I like it.","It seems to be a good ""primer"" on copyright law and other aspects of of publishing law. It's main value to me has been in confirming some of the concepts and thoughts that I had independently arrived at through study of the copyright code and some of the more significant court cases. The only real problem that I see with the book is that it is already out of date. It has nothing in it on the Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act or the Digital Millenium Copyright Act and really does not adequately address the problem of copyright infringement on the internet."
5,I feel Compelte,This Volume marked the completion of my Dragon Ball Magna. This Volume has many twists and i'm completely satisfied.
4,Awesome book,"Maopleon Hill,s best is contained in this book. Most of his stuff is hard to read. This book is in an efficient format that makes sense and is very readable."
5,Napolean Hill? Of course its good!,"""Each night I burn the records of the day; At sunrise every soul is born again"" WOW! That was not written by Mr Hill, but he was smart enough to add it to his book. There is so much good stuff in this book I do not know where to start. Other reviewers here have written more on the contents of the book, read theirs to get an idea.All I can say is that if you read and understand this book, then follow what you have learned, there is no way you cannot succeed in life. This book is filled with wisdom. If you are struggling in your life or on the job and need help, the help you need is in this book. Good luck on your journey!"
3,Service good...,"Service good... Product not so good. One tape was broken. I contacted the company, they sent me a new one. After one listen through the new tape popped as well. I did not bother ordering a new one. I'll try and stick to CD's. Good service though."
3,Good motivational material,Sage words of advice on how to accomplish more in your life. My only complaint is that the whole tape seems to be narrated by Joe Slattery and it is not read nearly as enthusiasticly as the original recordings made by Napoleon Hill himself.
4,Good entertainment,"""We're currently processing your review and we will email you as soon as this is complete"". Required length on reviews silly and makes it less like to review."
5,Support your cover.,I needed a cover support for my inboard ski boat and this fit the bill perfectly. The straps are easily adjustable to the proper length with good non-marring hooks and bow protector. The support pole adjusts easily and the strap bracket spreads the loads of the straps well. Easy to put up and does the job very well.
5,Just what I needed!,"Every winter I buy a new boat cover and try various props to keep the water from puddling by bailing it out after every rain storm. Sometimes it rains so much that it eventually splits the cover and I resort to tarps and more puddles. I considered buying a more expensive system (over $400) for extreme weather, but thought that for the price this was worth a shot. I LOVE IT! I am serious it is so simple but it works! It was easy to set up, I was able to set it up and cover the boat by myself in less than 15 minutes. We just had a week long rain storm and there is no standing water on the boat. I am very happy with this product."
5,No Weak @ss Symphony On These Discs....,"I have a feeling if Iggy & The Stooges were born and bread in Southern Cal circa 2000, they would sound something....if not exactly like this. How music can be so in your face yet so laid back at the same time is beyond the comprehension of my 5 senses. Friggin' cranked up, fuzzed out & balls through the wall guitar riffs. Ultra-cool lyrics delivered with sweat & passion. And, a rhythm section that flat out kicks @ss & takes no prisoners. I swear on my vinyl copies of ""Kiss Alive"", ""Unleashed In The East"" &""Strangers In The Night"", Fu Manchu has finally reached the summit of rock's Mount Olympus. When the ""idols"" of my youth release a live album with a freakin' wimpy symphony, it's great to see newer bands that can still ""respect the rock"" and kick out the jams.Add to cart ASAP."
5,Cruise-in music,This has got to be my favorite Fu Manchu album. It's a great compilation of their songs.Definatly in the top 5 of cd's to listen to while driving to the cruise-in on the weekend. Move over Beach Boys this is modern car guy music all the way.
4,Fun Unknown Altman,"Mostly unknown Altman that is a whole lot of fun, featuring a great Dennis Hopper working off of his Apocalypse Now character."
1,Can't believe this was Altman,"Nashville, Come back to the five and dime, The Player, MASH How could the man behind those be behind this?A vapid, obnoxious, exploitative teen movie without any of the charms of the genre.Poorly transferred too. I watched it through to the end in disbelief and wasted 90 odd minutes of my life.Avoid like the plague!!!"
1,Hideous Dog Death of a Movie,"I had a subscription to the National Lampoon in the 1970's. I read the O.C. & Stiggs stories. I reread the O.C. & Stiggs stories. I grew up with O.C. & Stiggs.Ladies & Gentlemen, this is NOT O.C. & Stiggs.The next time James Lipton of ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" wants to bow down at the altar of Robert Altman's infinite genius, make him sit through this vapid abomination and then quiz the great director on WHAT WAS HE THINKING!"
5,Advanced Algebra with the Ti-89,This book is very good. I recommend it to advanced high school students.
5,Great Product,"I really wanted a mp3 player and I wanted to find a nice one with plenty of features to keep me going. And I wanted one with a very reasonable price. It is a mp3 player my mom and I agreed on. Mp3, radio, movie player and more. What else can you ask for. If you are like me and want a nice music player with plenty of memory, BUY this device."
3,Unbiased? Lightweight?,"As a read the book is very enjoyable but the way the author skips over issues such as the real reasons for Gravano's turn against the family, which are well documented elsewhere, leaves one wondering how many other how complex relationships have been simplified to a point where the truth has been lost. At the price though it should be added to the library of anyone interested in the workings of organised crime."
2,This book sleeps with the fishes,"There is a lot of research in this book, but very little insight. It lacks the story-telling ability that makes a book great. I give the author credit for not sensationalizing, as so many mafia ""true crime"" authors do, but the book is dull -- and it shouldn't have been, given the subject."
4,Fabulous yet flawed,"I quickly became engrossed in this book and read it non-stop from start to finish. I have read many mob books and this one was one of the best. In fact, the only reason I could not honestly give it five stars is that the author, who is part of the Kennedy family and should have knowledge of loads of juicy stuff, balanced his intriguing personal experiences with glaring omissions regarding the mobs ties to his family and the JFK assassination."
4,A solid mob history,"MAFIA DYNASTY gives the history of New York's Gambino crime family, focusing on bosses Carlo Gambino (perhaps the smartest of the American dons), his cousin Paul Castellano, and the usurper John Gotti. Author Davis covers a lot of ground and provides a great source for Mafia aficionados. While the writing lacks the pizzazz of other books in this genre, it's worth having on your bookshelf for reference."
3,good overall view la cosa nostra,"this book goes into a fair amount of detail about the history and mechanics of lcn, their origins in america, and the key people responsible for their rise to power. as far as the gambino family is concerned. the author gave a lot of insight into the character and personalities of the bosses (carlo gambino, paul castellano, & john gotti), and he painted a pretty good picture of their business activities. if you're interested and curious about lcn history in america, then the book is a good read. when he gets into john gotti & the 80's, it starts to fall off with a lot of courtroom transcripts and less family business.ultimately, this book looks at lcn & the gambinos from a broader perspective. the intricacies and mysterties of the gambino family aren't revealed in a lot of detail."
2,Not even close,"All right. Now I have seen John Davis on a few documentarys giving his two cents about Luciano, Costello ECT. But this book is no good. It recaps (in a boring manner)information(largely false/uninteresting) that you could read in ny other mafia book. I highly recommend Five Families by Selwyn Raab or anyhting by Jerry Capeci. But not this sorry excuse for a mafia book."
4,pretty good,Rise and fall of the mafia. Good history on the Gambinos and other mafia. Some typos and a clear violent book. Read the book it's pretty good. I had to use sticky yellow paper to write down notes and keep track of the story the book has lots of pages so you might get lost in the story. There's present and past stories that's why I got lost so I had use notes. Interesting book overall life of an outlaw.
1,Awful,"Well John H. Davis has proven there is life after being a press secretary for John F. Kennedy. The president also happened to be married to his cousin. Of course thats been over 40 years ago and Davis has now decided to become a true crime author.This book has to be the most trumped up organized crime/true crime book to date. Davis takes rather common knowledge to the average mob researcher for individuals for the three main 'characters' Carlo Gambino, Paul Castellano and John Gotti. There is nothing revealing or of noteworthy in this book. Davis did very little research, splicing other book sources and the most notable was 'Boss of Bosses'.Nice try John but no cigar and when have you become a mob expert?"
3,A good story...but,"The story is good. I'm just about finished with it. At times the book is very difficult to put down. It keeps your interest. However, at times the reading can be tricky due to gramatical errors. I'm not just talking about a few. I find it very difficult to believe that this book could have been proof read prior to going to print. Examples are sentence structure; commas where periods should be; using ""can"" in instances where ""cannot should have been used; the word ""quiet"" was mis-spelled numerous times with ""quite"", using ""a"" when needing ""an"" and vice versa, etc. I was never an Engligh major (far from it) but the errors would discourage me from ordering another book from this publisher."
5,Don't miss this one!,"Very well written, unusual stores that grabbed me. If you haven't read this, get it now!"
2,Lame for Woods,"Found myself putting the book down more often then wanting to pick it up. Just could not get into it like his Stone Barrington series, hope he continues writing more Stone than boring Holly."
2,Not the worst book I ever read - but......,"My first Woods' novel and based on what I have read I will give him another try - but please...the story line was pretty thin - I kept finding inaccuracies and since I had never read Woods before I didn't get the ""Stone Barrington"" character - I just could not figure out the point.If you are sitting in an airport - completely bored - buy it - you can finish it before you get home!"
3,Good but not as good!,"After reading Orchid Beach, I was really excited to find out that the character, Holly Barker was going to be a continuing story. This book, the second in the ""Orchard"" series is weaker than the first. Although I did manage to finish, I could put it down and walk away. That is not usually the case with Stuwart Woods books. If you enjoy Woods, you will still like the book. If you have not previously read Woods, start with another book"
4,A quick and fun read.,"Holly Barker is the cities Police Chief and is accompanied by her best friend Daisy, her Doberman Pincher. The book starts with Holly waking up on the morning of her wedding day. However, her day takes a sharp downturn when her fiancé is murdered during a bank robbery that turned violent. Holly leads the official investigation with the aid of her friend in the FBI. The investigation leads her to a town that is not shown on any maps. The inhabitants are white supremacists who recruit Holly's dad Ham into joining their organization. Ham pretends to join this group and is quickly given a key role within it. His infiltration of the group enables the law enforcment agencies involved to learn that Ham is selected to assassinate a VIP, but no one knows whom the intended victim is. Unless they can learn the identity of the target, someone will die."
2,Orchid Blues....it gave me the blues!,"I was so excited after reading ""Orchid Beach"" to read part two of the Holly Barker Novels ""Orchid Blues"". The first 10 chapters were good and kept me interested, however, after that this book just dragged on and on and on. I mean I thought the novels were about Holly Barker not her father Ham. This book focused more on Ham and him investigating a group of individuals than it did on Holly and her investigative skills. I hope this book doesn't deter me from reading other Holly Barker novels. There were some pretty good points in the book though, some parts I actually really enjoyed, esepcially how Mr. Woods tied in Stone Barrington to this particular story. I loved that! Other than that I felt like this book was a really long read for me and I'd actually have to say it bored me most of the time. I have the next book Blood Orchid, I do hope its a much better book than this one. I'll give the series another chance."
3,Quick Read,"This next book in the Holly Barker series was a quick read, I read it in a day. I was really disappointed that Woods' already killed off a good character, Holly and Jackson were so great together. I enjoy the series so far and have downloaded on my Kindle the next books for this series."
2,"Not up to to par, skip this one","Light reading, rather boring, poor character development, defintiely not in line with his other writing."
5,A Fast Read,"Stuart Wood's Orchid Blues is a fast read ... his chapters are short, making you want to read on & on. Having only read one of Sutart's books (Orchid Blues), I am definitely going to read more of them. You know there's violence; you know there's mystery; you know there's accuracy. I read it so fast, I didn't even look at the back to see how it ended! Now that's a good mystery! And no swearing ... I am now going to read Blood Orchid. And since Holly meets up with Stone, I will then go on to read the series of crime scenes he's involved in. Thank you, Stuart Woods."
2,what happen to Stuart Woods?,"I read the first 100 pages and wondered when the book would begin. Very little story, poor character development. I look forward to my favorite author's releases but this was a big disapointment."
1,A terrific writer continues a downhill slide,"""Chiefs"" was a terrific novel, richly detailed and with fully-fleshed out characters you could really care about. The plotting was intricate and believable - in short, a great, satisfying read, and I looked forward to much more of the same from this author.Unfortunately, he is turning out to be a one-trick pony, as everything he's written since a great beginning has been glib, facile and formulaic. One dimensional, unlikeable characters for the most part (Stone Barrington is a pleasure-loving sybarite who'd screw his brother's wife if he had the opportunity) and flat, unexciting stories.I hate to see it. Writers with real talent are rare, and Stuart Woods used to be one of the best. Now he's become something much less.I don't think I'll be reading any more of his books."
2,Not So Blue,"I had hoped that ORCHID BLUES would be on a par with Stone Barrington, but alas, it is not. It is a quick read but there is no real character development and I think Woods does himself and his readers a dis-service. The characters are so poorly drawn that I lost interest in them very quickly. This book is ordinary... I can't recommend it."
1,Sloppy Orchid,"I usually find Stuart Woods' novels fast-paced fun. This sequel to ORCHID BEACH (which I enjoyed) is silly and...what's worse...sloppy. Did Woods dash this one off over a weekend? Characters actually contradict themselves, forget things they said earlier in the novel, and ramble unedited. Loose ends abound.On top of that, the bad guys are just another stereotyped bunch of ""right-wing racist militiamen."" These baddies went out of style and became hackneyed several years ago. No motivation, no persoanlity, no menace.I looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! Skip it."
1,I'm so disappointed in Woods.....,"Stuart Woods used to be one of my favorite 'read in one sitting' writers. Now, he's just turning out so much pulp fiction. ORCHID BEACH is a perfect example of his pulp and, frankly, I'm tired of reading it.....I won't be buying any more Woods.I agree with the reviewer who had issues with that diatribe at the end of the book where he instructs readers on how to/not to contact him.....he's fallen into the trap of believing his own publicity machine.The writing is second-rate...the chapters are short and choppy...the subject matter, while interesting, is so contrived and formulatic (is there such a word) that the whole effort is reduced to the ridiculous."
1,So Sloooow!!Reviewer: Thriller Lover,"Made a big mistake with this one I tried to take it seriously. Explosive start and a really bang-up ending, but in between I thought I'd fall asleep. As per the last Holly story, little character development, inflated and over-the-top plot. What are the chances that a small town police chief would be involved in TWO world conspiracies within a year, or ever? Woods also still is bad at writing women. I'll give him one more chance in book 3, but if that one isn't any better, I'm done. Daisy is still the best character in the book."
1,"Cheesy, corny, lame, hokey","What a terrible story, was unable to finish it, Stuart Woods was at one time a very good author, but when he started with Holly and Stone, he in effect quit writing, this is about a militant band of right wingers robbing banks and oh by the way just had to kill Holly's intended just an hour before the wedding which didn't seem to break Holly up all that much as she still has her best friend, her dog and her father which she has conversations with regarding three somes and their sex lives in general, Signet books and Stuart Woods should both be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market."
4,Not as good as the last Holly Barker,"This is the second of the Holly Barker series by Stuart Woods and I didn't think this one was as good as the first, however I do like the Holly Barker character as well as her dad Ham. I listened to the first one on tape and I am wondering if this one would have been better on tape as well. I did read in a day though, so it does keep your interest. It starts out with a bank robbery and ends up with some Nazi type group trying to over throw the government. It is a dialogue book for the most part and quite well done in that regard. I would probably give this 4 out of 5 stars simply because I didn't think the plot was that strong. The exchanges between Holly and Ham are good though. I am sure this is only the second in many more to come. I know I will get the next one when it comes out."
4,"Interesting, but graphic","Isabelle Dufresne, aka 'Ultra Violet', was an heiress who entered Andy Warhol's circle in the late 1950s. She describes her decadent lifestyle in far more detail than I wanted to read, but she makes no excuses for herself. She admits her mistakes, but along the way she meets everyone who was anyone during the wild 1960s. The book gives an insider's look into Warhol's famous 'Factory', and concludes with an extensive listing of those who survived it and those who didn't. It is a very interesting read."
1,Windows 7 Compatibility,Does this product work with Windows 7 or Windows Vista ?My understanding is that it will not work on anything newer than XP.
4,tool purchase,The items purchased were for my son. He was very happy with the tools. They were exactly what he expected.
1,Wrong one.,The product code in the box is right but inside you will get a different Shock Absorber of the picture shown on the website.Seems to be front shock but its size was like the rear one.
2,Not consistent electronic device.,This alarm is a great concept and is very good when it works. We had problems with the transmitter draining batteries and not alarming when it was supposed to. Sent back to store for check and they said it was OK but still had the problem when it came back. It seems the engineering/design of this product made in Holland is not up to a 5 star rating. I am very disappointed especially since we did all the special electrical checks on the device.
4,Book in great condition.,"This is a great book for learning Spanish. The book arrived in great condition, just like it was described."
3,heavy-handed,"Levine lays into The Planets most decidedly. Bangingly percussive, heavily accented, to the point of being unbalanced.It's an interesting interpretation, thoroughly post-modern, and not recommended until you've heard the real thing.For starters, try Bernstein, Dutoit, Karajan, Maazel, or Mehta."
4,exotic taste,My grand children loved these chovlates and want more. I am glad that I selected Leonidas Belgian Chocolates
1,"Um, no.","I've had the unit for a year. Used it 4-5 times last Winter (Georgia, USA.) Had trouble lighting it at the end of the season. This year, it wont light. I put in fresh fuel, cleaned the air filters and fuel filter, adjusted the air pressure, checked the igniter, and cleaned the photo cell. I am now an expert in most aspects of this device. After all that it lit and ran perfectly - twice. Now, it won't light, won't even try. I checked everything again, but can't find anything wrong. I'm about to walk out the door. Gone shopping for a new heater :(SC"
1,Don't waste you money on a Reddy Heater,"I bought a used kerosene heater in 1995, it lasted 11 years. Since then I have gone thru 3 Reddy Heaters, the products works great, but for a very short time, at least that was my experience with the 3 units I bought. I continued to exchange the units because I thought it was just a fluke. I have tried their Tech Support, I have been on hold today for near 1 1/2 hours today. This has been very frustrating."
2,Did not work,It was not possible to make them work with my Yamaha drum module a lots of false triggering. Avoid them
2,"Not a reference, and not an introductory text","The book's subtitle is ""A Complete Reference for Project Builders"". It should be ""A Glossing Over for People Who Already Know About Electronics"".The first half of the book is an (incomplete) in-depth explanation about electricity, resistance, capacitance, and inductance. The next 75 pages cover semiconductors, going in-depth about junctions then diodes, then glossing over the various transistor types.The last third of the book is a thorough glossing over of various ICs, transducers, and 10 pages on switches.In other words, don't get this book if you're a beginner, because you will be confused by what it leaves out. Don't get this book if you are looking for a reference, because you will be frustrated by what it leaves out. And don't get it if you are looking for a refresher on electronics theory, as you will be dissatisfied with it's overly simplistic explanations."
2,Uninspired treatment,"What is coyly termed an ""interpretation"" with ""a sense of humor"" is, on closer listening, a rushed, inconsistent treatment of the music. In some passages, one can sense that Kempff is thinking about the music to come, and blips through a powerful phrase with no attention to tempo or harmonic relationship. Tempo is constantly inconsistent; minor technical errors abound from slips; there is a total lack of inspiration. Some of the most amazing passages of Beethoven's music receive a lackluster, inconsistent treatment. So much meaning is lost. I simply can't understand why people rave about this collection. There is no joy in this set. You are warned."
1,Overrated,"Much praise has been given this collection and I'm at a loss as to why. The recorded sound as well as the performances themselves are dismal. If you don't mind tape hiss, noticeable splices, etc., then by all means buy this set. However, I would recommend the set by Jeno Jando on Naxos. Besides the clarity of the recording, he actually puts his heart into the playing."
5,The Essential Beethoven Sonata Set,"I have quite a few complete sets of the sonatas, and tens of recordings of several of the individual works. This cycle was my first and the one I would keep if I had to pare down to only one. (Of course, I'd also want to be able to keep individual recordings by Gilels, Solomon, and Richter.)"
2,I could not connect to these interpretations.,"Having just heard Emil Gilel's beautiful, immediate versions of Sonatas 15 and 17 on a Deutsche Grammophon CD, these Kempff recordings seemed hurried and perfunctory. Absent is a sense that the music is saying anything. I am left supposing that these were technically correct interpretations in Mr. Kempff's mind, but I'm not convinced that he loved these pieces."
5,awesome must read book,i wish everyone struggling with a disability would read this book. it gives a historical perspective people ignore. i loved it.
2,Sepultura - 'Roorback' (SPV),"Let's face it,Sepultura USED to be one of the best in the metal genre.A sad fact,but it appears the band just cannot write that great of tunes anymore.Not at least on this effort.I liked their '98 'Against' CD much better,their first with frontman Derrick Taylor.'Roorback' goes on for nearly an hour and with fourteen tracks total,the only ones I even found somewhat to my liking were ""Come Back Alive"",""Corrupted"",maybe ""Mind War"" and their cover of U2's ""Bullet The Blue Sky""(you read that right).A word or two of advise to these guys:Taylor means well,I'm sure,but EITHER get Max Cavalera back or just plain and simple,give it up."
2,SOME GREAT SONGS.....,"I really love the early SEPULTURA albuns like BENEATH THE REMAINS and ARISE....I really enjoy AGAINST....but after that, SEP really bring some uninspired work....ROORBACK is better than NATION, but still got some uninspired tracks...ACTIVIST, THE RIFT and CORRUPTED are great songs, but the rest is not really remarkable....TRY DANTE and A-LEX!!!!They are both great!!!!"
1,Old sep is way better...,"It's sad how sepultura have changed into a crappy band when they used to be one amazing thrash band with fast & pure brutally...Now, they sound slow and totaly nu-metal its just so sad! I knew sep was done when they made the album chaos a.d. after that disc i knew in my mind that every thing was gone and here comes the new terrible sep with chaos a.d,roots bloody roots,roots (unoriginal),against,nation, and the new horrible piece of sh*t ever called roorback its just a shame! Why didn't they just kept it thrash ? For amazing sep buy ""schizophrenia"" , ""morbidvision/bestial devastation"" , ""beneath the remains"" , & ,""arise"" those are truly thrash masterpieces rimends me old slayer and carnal forge and the haunted by influences...Don't bother!"
2,Very Average at Best.,"Atleast they are trying this time around. Still no where near as good as the band was with Max.Pros: Faster and more back to their roots than the other releases without Max at the helm. Guitar playing is passable.Cons: Lack of solos. Derrick is still lacking as a vocalist. Just isn't as good as old Sepultura, songs lack hooks and are mostly forgetable.Bottom Line: This album falls short of expectations. The current Sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal band at best. If you like old Sepultura I suggest you not waste your money on this, but then again you might like it. Buyer beware."
2,What happend to Seplutura?,"Ok so Max left the band, should that have really turned this band into what they are now? A joke? This album ""Roorback"" was hyped as a return to Sepultura's classic thrash era. I couldn't be more dissapointed. There is NO similarities to this and the Classic Sepultura era material. I give them musch credit for being together still. I give even more credit to the record label that picked them up, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? This album is mediocre at best. If you haven't heard a Seplutura album DONT GET THIS ONE. Get Arise, Beneath the Remains OR Chaos AD instead."
1,Roorback the best ever???,"First of all is very sad that most latin american countries likes communism, thats maybe because the have never lives this type of regime, and of course is very sad that sepultura takes the communism side too, but talking about the album , i'm a sepultura fan myself and i consider that since max left the band they can't make it by themselfs and i dont think they will, you want to check nice music listen to the last kreator and you will learn....."
2,Do you like chaos ad? if yes do not hear this album,Where is the passion and the thrash <<melody>> which was in chaos ad? I liked very much chaos - roots - arise. But this album is so poor. Its so monotonous without any song that can be named as a <<hit>>. Its a really boring album. See for yourself if you want
1,"not enough information, very complicated and hard to understand...",I needed help with my illness and I read this book. I was looking for help. While reading it I got so depressed because I couldn't understand the author's advice.
3,Better than the large version...,"But, that's not saying much. The clinical flowcharts are somewhat useful. But, like much of naturopathy this book is geared toward questionable diagnoses like food intolerances, intestinal disbyosis and toxic liver. But what more can one expect when the 3rd author, an instrutor at Bastyr College, has another book attributing almost all illness to dehydration!"
4,an undiscovered gem,"I normally don't write too many CD reviews, because most of the time I feel that I have nothing to add to the usually voluminous reviews on most CD's. So in this case, I felt very surprised that nobody has written a review on this CD which has been released for over a month, especially since this is such good music. May be it's because Ash is from Nothern Ireland and therefore unfamiliar in the States. I wouldn't rate this CD 5 stars, but I could honestly say the stuff here is better than 80% of the new music out there. Ash's latest release has songs that with good melodies, intelligent and reflective lyrics, and good execution. The best track is the title track, ""Twilight of the Innocents"". In fact, IMO just the title track is worth the price of the CD. It has the kind of emotional outburst that brings to mind the Who's ""Love Reign O'er Me"". This is a good band with some great stuff. It'd be a shame if more people didn't check them out. Enjoy!"
4,good cd from ash,"I think this album is very good i was quite afraid to buy it ashes cd have not been as good as free all angels ,but it decent.The standouts are ,i started a fire, you cant have it all,polaris, and twilight of the innocents ,the songs are well written and played .Buy this cd if you like feeder iam sure you will like these guys to.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
5,I love this product.,I have rheumatiod arthritis so I have difficulty getting on my horse. Now it is so easy. The horse doesn't mind it and I like the storage area. The steps are perfect in height and width. The body is sturdy and long-lasting.
3,Phil Manzanera / 801 / Manchester,"Well, The album feels like a rehearsal or a very loose concert. A good listen with talented people. They are not on ""fire"" though. For completests only. Nice crisp recording and mastering. If you are crazy about 801 Live and expect this to be music of the same quality and intensity, I'm sorry you will be a bit disappointed. It has some sweet moments, I'll give it that."
1,Not the one..... Not the (80)one....,"""801 Live"" is perfect, isn't it?Who wouldn't want more of the same?Like me, you might get this, hoping for it.Don't. Just don't. It's simply not in the same league.Crushingly disappointing, flabby and completely awful, you really wonder who on Earth ever thought it would be a good idea to release it. However poor an impression I'm conveying here, believe me, listening to the thing is worse.Zathras would be muttering, clucking and shaking his head in disapproval."
5,"Simply, the best.","These preludes are all too familiar to those of us who love the piano. But, Mr. Pogorelich's playing lights all corners and will make you feel as though you have never really heard or understood the preludes before. I've always thought Rubinstein's interpretations to be the best. I now believe Mr. Pogorelich to be a notch above. I totally agree with Marta Argarich, he is a genius."
1,Suprising but not genuine...,"I was very dissapointed in this CD. i am currently learning all 24 chopin preludes, and i decided this would be nice to add to my collection. But these preludes are not of the high calibur of many artists before him. His quirky ""hiccup"" sound and lightness on the fast peices merely brush the surface of what Chopin intended. And he draws out the long peices to a painful extent, No. 15 ecspecially..the dramatic melody is lost because he is going so slowly. His interpretations of the pieces are either to far one way or the other. for a true recording of these peices, try Martha Argerich."
1,Crap,"This is a very cheaply made product. The parts dont fit together very well. The stuff you build falls apart, because they fit together so loose. Not worth the money at all."
4,"My son loves it, but it's hard to build much with so few pieces","My son who is 4 plays with this all the time & loves it. There really aren't many pieces that come with this, so if I had to buy again I would go for a bigger set (esp. since we seem to lose pieces all around the house). I never had the original so I can't compare it like the other reviewers, but everything seems to fit together just fine in our set."
1,Who decides to make this garbage?,"This is nothing like the classic. I spent 1000 hour playing with my tinkertoys in the 70s. This new style is cheap, useless garbage. It is not compatible with the old style sets. The tolerances on the manufacturing are all over the place so some parts fit fine and others just fall out. Plus the price is a ripoff. Anyone who was involved with bringing this product to market should be fired."
1,DO NOT BUY TINKER TOYS! THEY ARE JUNK!,"My daughter was given this set for her birthday September 12th, 2012. It is hard to build anything because so many fittings are too loose. Pieces are mostly too loose so anything you try to make just falls apart. Super disappointing expensive firewood! Very sad because I had these as a kid and made all kinds of things. I would rate this at zero if the system would allow it."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,This was very disappointing for the money. The parts don't stay together well. I couldn't even make anything with it let alone my 4 year old Granddaughter. I am going to try lincoln logs next time.
4,"Nice, would have liked all wood","Have several versions of tinker toy. I agree with some other reviewers, the quality could be lot better. But the concept is awesome. As name says, it is for tinkerers. In this day and age when electronics is introduced to kids at a very young age, mechanical toys and its significance should be emphasized very much. Good for both girls and boys alike."
3,ok toy...useful for educational setting,"there are very few pieces in each box, but when combined can be used for groups. I don't know how long these pieces will last."
1,Meh,"I went with Tinkertoy because it was the brand I grew up with; and the set I had was easy to play with & very durable. Today, I was disappointed to get a set of Tinkertoys with lots of end caps & elbows, & not enough spools. A few of the rods were too big, in that they could not get into the holes in the spools, and other rods were too small in that they were spinning & eventually fall out. A few of the rods' slits were so small that we bent a flag just trying to get it in. Even with the elbows, many of the rods fall out, much to the disappointment of my 4 year old. At the moment I'm helping her play with them because at times she cannot get some pieces to pull apart, and other pieces to stay together. And sad that she already admits she's afraid to break them."
5,Simply Fantastic,"I'm a huge must fan, and I think all of their albums are amazing. It's one of the few bands that, although I still have my favorite songs in the album, I can listen from track 1 to the end without a desire to skip any of their songs. This isn't their greatest album in my opinion. Top honors goes toAbsolutionand their most recent albumBlack Holes and Revelations.On a side note, there is a group called 'The String Quartet;' they're a tribute band that translates major pieces from big time artists into orchestar pieces. Every band they've made a tribute to so far, I've loved (Tool, Muse, the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Check them out)"
5,Mesmerizing,"Muse's second album is an adventure in style and sound, from the tinkling piano introduction of ""Bliss,"" to the rocking and rollicking ""Plug In Baby,"" to the jazzy, lilting ""Feeling Good."" Joining Freddie Mercury, Matthew Bellamy has quickly become one of my favorite musical geniuses.I have experienced Muse's four albums in a somewhat reverse order (3,4,2,1), which makes me curious how my perceptions might have been different had I gotten to know them chronologically. I highly recommend all of their albums."
5,Muse's Best,"Oh wow was my first reaction when I heard this album. Simply I think The Muse's best album for sure.However, I found it a little bit puzzling that no one noticed the Philip Glass influence in the opening track, Newborn.But given The Muse's penchant for classical music (look at how cleverly they incorporated Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto in Butterflies and Hurricanes on Absolution, right down to the bass riff), I'm not surprised.Whatever you do, get this ablum!!!!"
4,Wonderful,"The best way that I can describe them is 65% Radiohead, 30% Queen, and 5% Metallica!A crazy mix indeed, and very enjoyable at that!"
3,The Best Queen Album in Years,"In 1999, I overrated Muse's debut CD Showbiz with the hyperbole of a rabid fan. Sucked in by a surface sheen that faded with repeat listenings, their art rock turned into too much pomp-and-circumstances. In the end, they seemed like Styx with a more powerful, though just as preening, lead singer. Origin of Symmetry does nothing to change my mind now, but this is the best Queen rip I've ever heard - and I'm not talking commercial Queen here, more like Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack - pretentious and campy and riotously enjoyable. Let Radiohead turn into Pink Floyd; Muse is the new king of cheese, whether he knows it or not. (Most likely not, which is why this is such a hoot.)"
2,Overrated,"I bought this not having heard anything from the band on the strengh of the review by Q Magazine. As happens when you go in without knowing too much, you run the great risk of being dissatisfied. I don't know what I expected coming in, but the reviews were likening it to Radiohead and Queen. Maybe they just meant in their progressive and orchestral aspects, which certainly can be found here. But this certainly had nothing that those other bands posses which make them memorable, mainly hooks and panache, which are completely lacking in this effort."
4,ESSENTIAL MUSE..!!!,"This album rocks so hard, that listening to the opening track New Born while driving your car may cause you to speed and T-Bone right into the middle of a passing School Bus... ONLY TO RIP RIGHT THRU THE FIRE AND THE FLAMES & BLAST ACROSS THE HIGHWAY MELTING THE ASPHALT!!!!"
4,Brilliant beginning can only partially recover,"With one of the most unabashedly potent 1-(especially)2-3 opening punches of alternative pop-rock in recent decades, this take-no-prisoners trio of a haunted melodic momentum is hard pressed to follow the entire album up with that kind of startling starting energy. There continues to be plenty of strong moments throughout, but the trail-off is evident and especially damaging when the band goes into their faux-RATM aggro-mode."
5,muse are a rocking band,i first heard muse about two years ago and later saw the video for newborn ever since then i have been hooked on all things musecomparisons have been made to radiohead but i think this is just because of bellamy's voice and vocal range being similar to that of yorke and like radiohead muse have a very unique sound that is sometimes a little off the walli would highly recommend this album and if you buy this and like it buy showbiz as well because it's just as good and brilliant for a debut albumthe guitar parts are heavy and blisteringly fast in places but sutle and soft sounding in others sometimes heavy distortion is used but others it is clean cut guitarthis is one of the best albums i have ever bought and i am listening to it constantly i only hope muse's next one will be as good and contain as much a variety or sounds
5,A true masterpiece that only Muse could create.,"This is it. Origin of Symmetry. The one album that will spearhead the fight against the pop music ( Is it even music?) loving zombies of our time. Buy it now. NOW!PS: If you come in contact with these zombies, play Micro Cuts. Loud."
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be,I found myself thinking how can a band sound so emotional and soDull at the same time. I think they sound too theatrical and it doesn't come across as genuine to me. I was disappointed...sorry
5,MUSE ARE GODS!,"A-MAXING STUFF!! these guys are the best live act in the world at the moment, and this cd a work of art. if you like alternative music (of any kind) buy this cd right NOW! i promise you wont regret it!"
5,Everything About You Is so Easy To Love...,"This is the best album I've heard all year. Elements of Radiohead, pre-KID A. I'd have to say every song on ""Origin of Symmetry"" blows me away. Hyper Music, New Born, Space Dementia, faves. I can't believe I had the opportunity to see Muse live while in the UK last summer but declined as I hadn't heard of them yet at that point and didn't feel up to slending money on a ticket to see a band I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy or not. I should have taken the chance!! Muse rock. Buy this record. 'Nuff said."
5,Muse on vinyl - what more do you want,"I'm just reviewing the quality of the vinyl here. This album has been out for quite some time now, so no point in reviewing the music. Just encase you have not heard the album on CD/mp3 it's out of this world.The vinyl is a improvement over the CD and way better than any lossy formats.It opens up the sound and helps it sound less clinical. Good quality of vinyl and nice inserts. Some have mentioned the cover looks like a poor quality re-scan. I think this is part of the intended look, if not I don't care as the vinyl it's self is great."
4,all the way to the stars,"You may or you may not like the music Muse make, but you can't simply ignore it. At least not now. Although 'Showbiz', their debut, had an astonishingly good music coming from so young musicians, it didn't get the thumbs up you'd expect. The only reason mentioned: they're copycats. Well, it can't be denied that at times they really sounded a lot like Radiohead, but even it is so, is it a good enough reason to disregard music with that quality? The winds have changed. Radiohead have gone their way and Muse evolved into something you may even fear of. Introduced by the rather one-faced but tricky single 'Plug-In Baby', this album is really something close to a space opera. It is loud and atmospheric and it constantly morphes into something you didn't expect, led by one of the most original frontmen in the moment, Bellamy. That's about it. Don't want to be fun-spoiler. Cheers!"
3,growing pains,"ok ... I think muse has got a loooong way to go before they make a really good album. Showbiz was a great debut....it was pretty much strong the whole way through, and had great energy, but they were carbon copy radioheads. This one has some absolutely wonderful tracks, but a lot of problems to be worked out. New Born is a great huge dramatic rocker, Bliss is really cool and bouncy, Hyper Music rocks, Plug in Baby is hands down their best work ever, and Feeling Good is really unpretensious fun. ... equal parts poofed up prog hair metal and liberace opera, matthew bellamy needs to kick his helium addiction.....write more songs that don't sound like aimless art ...and then we'll see what kind of great band they can be."
3,Not Muse's best work,"This CD is an obvious beginner for Muse. A few songs are ok, but overall, get their newer stuff. Especially if you are new to Muse. Took a risk on this one and it didn't pay off. Some may like it, but again, personal preferrence."
2,Yuck,"Muse make Radiohead's bombast seem demure and subtle. This is just plain kitsch. The music is really derivative and cheesey. The vocals are painfully awful. Some fool had the audacity to say Muse's singer is better than Jeff Buckley in thier review of Grace...i laughed hard. Muse are not pretty nor do they rock, they are just annoying."
2,pretty lame,I bought this cd based on a review in a guitar magazine that raved about this singer/guitar player like he was the next guitar god. It turns out he's not even that knowledgable of the instrument and very amature in his playing and song writing. Nothing interesting going on at all. It sounds too much like Radiohead but not as good with some Tom Murello guitar licks thrown in. I see why they have'nt released this in America yet.
2,Too much noise.,"I listened to a couple of sample songs from Muse's ""Absolution"" in the store and absolutely like them and since ""Symmetry"" was on sale I decided to buy that one. Wasn't a good idea. I had a completely different impression. Generally too much noise and screaming. At times it seems the singer has some kind of a breathing problem. Or at least he occasionally does sound he is choking or something. Musically rather bland, not too many good ideas and not too melodic either. And I do not think his voice is in any way similar to that of Thom Yorke."
2,Just okay,"If you like over done, contrived music, then you'll like this. The singer is annoying constantly singing way above his range with way too much vibrato. Sounds like he's being killed.It's like Radiohead combined with ranchero music."
2,Late model weak,"Weak coverage on the later model front wheel drive Mopars. Guess Mopar Action forgets that these are the cars that kept Chrysler from going bankrupt. Kinda gets old seeing the same old $100,000 'Cudas and Challengers."
1,Can't review till I recieve it,"I have yet to recieve the first issue of my paid subscription. I would like to say,'great magazine',but I have not recieved one yet. I still waiting 1/24/2007"
4,pretty good so far,"Just got this camera a few days ago. I've taken several types of pictures so far and don't have any complaints (closeup, scenes, and portraits).I gave the camera to my wife to take a few pictures and like the other reviewer, she too had a problem with blurry shots. The problem was that the camera didn't reset itself from macro lens mode after turning it off and back on (I just assumed it did). I changed that and haven't had any more problems."
2,Beauty is only skin deep,"I wanted to love this camera, I bought it to take pictures hanging out with friends and the occasional road trip. The outdoor pictures were great! But once you take that camera inside and the light is low forget about image quality. I tried all the scene modes, this camera just can't compare to other compact cams on the market. The pictures come out blurry, colors blend into each other. Interior lighting causes all kinds of interior blur streaks to appear in the images.I get rave reviews on the looks, but I just can't stand having to tinker endlessly to get a nonblurry inside picture. And for the money, I had a 2 Megapixel Canon that was more capable inside."
1,not what i expected,the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture. it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk.
3,Not perfect,I bought this camera for its size and to take snap shots. It serves these purposes but has some flaws. Photos with flash in low light tend to be grainy and dark and the camera is exteremly slow. I have owned and used several digital cameras includng other Nikons and this is by far the slowest especially when the flash is required.
4,Very good product,"I'm very satisfied with this product. Picture's quality could be a little better, but its features are excellent. Its dimensions are perfect for taking everywhere, and it's very easy to use."
2,Aggravating!,"I initially loved this camera. I don't use my camera that much, but when I do, I expect it to work. I charged the battery the night before I left for a vacation. The next day I took a few pictures and then realized that the battery was almost dead. I hadn't even used the camera but for a total of about five minutes since I last charged it! It was not exposed to any extreme temperatures that would mess up the battery, either. Also, when I try to review my pictures, about 80% of the time, the camera says that it cannot read the card. I have to take out the memory card and put it back in. (even then it doesn't read it sometimes.) If this camera won't even work half of the time, what's the point in bothering to carry it with me?"
2,Too Small,"Quality and features are fine, but camera is probably too small for you if you have large hands. If I use two hands I am fighting to keep my fingers out of my shots. Because of the shape and weight distrubution I find it difficult to shoot with one hand. I have a much larger camera (Canon S1 IS) that I often use one-handed with no issues.To be fair, this criticism certainly applies to lots of super small digital cams. The S3 seems even worse than many others to me though. Be sure to at least handle one before you buy."
2,Not good,"It looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it. Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry. Sorry I wasted my money on this one. Get one of the new ones with VR so you don't have that issue."
5,Polypharmacy in Psychiatry,"This is a thoughtful, balanced, and important book that all clinicians should have in their library"
5,Pure artistry and a velvet voice,"I don't know if I would consider this singer the best out there--how can one truly know??--but I DO consider her to be one of my very favorite singers after hearing this album. I admire her artistry and that beautiful, honey-toned voice that envelops you in the drama of Brahms' exquisitely crafted, haunting music. It has been awhile since I listened to this CD but I am overdue. She is an intelligent and very emotionally/mentally aware singer, and it is hard to find any vocal or dramatic limitations on this CD. I am waiting for the day when I can see her live (and maybe sing on the same stage next to her!) This album is very worth its price, but prepare for a very dramatic journey--this is not easy, light, or background music--this music will make you feel intensely if you let it. (Also, for a very different interpretation and equally valid, in my opinion, check out the darker and thicker contralto voice of Mitsuko Shirai/Hartmut Höll in Brahms: 21 Lieder.)"
5,Power Cable for Camera,I bought the cable so I could connect a battery pack to my Olympus digital camera. Each end of the cable properly fit and it worked fine. The cable was long enough to keep the battery pack in my pocket while it is connected to the camera while I am shooting.
1,Yuck,"This oder came in quickly but this did not taste the same as the other ones I ordered. It was old and melted. I didnt want to send it back because it takes a lot of time and im not that mean of a person, i dumped it. Waist my money :("
1,yucky,This watermelon candy was terrible. It was not watermelon flavored or colored. It tasted yucky and wasnt pretty at all. I think it was broken and melted or something. I will not order it again.
2,Outrighteous....mmm....,"The movie was quite disappointing - I wouldn't watch it twice and would not recommend it to my friends. The plot is rather weak and the acting was flat. There were attempts at comedy but they were not well executed so the humour was lost. Also, I think the lesson that it's not right for a guy to date two girls at the same time didn't come through - the criticism was more on the girls for wanting the same man. At the end, the message about acts of righteousness needing to be done selflessly was good but came too late - I had already mentally switched off and was just waiting for the movie to end."
5,Wonderful purchase,The product came just as was stated in perfect condition and like brand new. Was very happy with this purchase and it came in great time as well.
3,Excessivly loud fan! Otherwise good.,"The installation of the drive is easy. The 2 screws and slide the back panel through the enclosure towards the front.Slide the drive in and 4 screws and it is secure. slide back into enclosure and 2 screws to complete.The airflow did concern me, but it appears to be cooling well even though there is only a small exit vents at the rear.The largest concern is the noise. it is a very loud whirl. For my use it will only be for archiving video and picture data so I won't be running but occassionally.I could not use consistently as the noise it too much. That is why the 3 star. Would have been more stars if not so noisy.I would only recommend for archiving or if you can place away and purchase a long USB cable to keep that noise away.The MAX4 is quite a bit more cost but it quiet if you need on all the time. Not many options for fan'd enclosures. ULtra is anothe one with a fax."
4,Great device with 2 drawbacks,"Got it for Xmas and musically it is everything advertised. Great sound. Easy syncing with iTunes. Simple navigation. Good looks. Even the earbuds work well (and since I use these to exercise, I'm pretty picky about this). Two drawbacks, though: battery life is nowhere near advertised - I'm getting about 4-5 hours per charge and it claims 12 - and this model seems to scratch pretty easily. Other than that, it's a wonderful device."
1,piece of sh!t,This iPod will randomly freeze. I have been through 3 in a year. It works fine until it decides it wants to shut down. Then the sad iPod icon comes up and you cant restore or reset it. so you have to send it in to apple and wait a week to get it back. Unless your warranty is up like mine was. Now they want to charge me $250 to ship my ipod out and repair it because the warranty expired a month ago. i could buy a new 40GB COLOR VIDEO IPOD for $200 instead of the 20GB BLACK/WHITE PLAIN U2 IPOD saving $50. Its just insane. something is wrong with this models hard drive. Too many other people have had this same problem for it to be a coincidence! so do yourself a favor: Buy a plain one; it will save you so many headaches.
1,PLEASE GET AN APPLE CARE PROGRAM!!!,"I got this Ipod on Christmas 2 years ago.. It was fine and made me very very happy.. but one of a sudden it completely stopped working and got the sad Ipod icon and the folder icon. Of course I called Apple Stores to see if they can get it fixed, but they told me that they didn't fixed them, and when they got that kind of problems they just give one new on refund... but my problem was that I didn't have an apple care program... so I called like one million places to get it fixed but this will cost me about US$ 200 so I got a brand new Ipod video instead, but I will try to get it fixed on the future. I've learned this is a problem on this kind of Ipods, so I highly recommend to get an Apple Care program in case you are planning to get this ipod."
4,U2 Ipod,I agree I used impulse and purchased this.......I dont regret it really its nice looking but so are the others....I am a big fan of U2 so I decided to buy it but shouldve used a bit more discretion........
5,Can't get something for nothing,"Decide for yourself what you think is better:1) Fall for a bogus offer and sign up for a bunch of trial offers which are impossible to cancel. Tons of spam. All for the ""promise"" of a refurbished iPod.2) Ignore too-good-to-be-true hype and find a legitimate way to save money on an iPod."
1,Buy Sony and RCA's media players instead,"This is a good music player and looks pretty nice.It is overadvertised and everyone has one so its not even unique. There are many better players at comparable prices with 20GB or greater harddrive.There are many accesseries you have to buy for it which you'd get free with other mp3 players(SONY Walkman digital music player and my favorite the RCA jukebox and video player)It holds less songs than Sony's(Sony-13,000,Apple-5,000)You can't watch movies in color on a 3.5inch flatscreen(you can on RCA's)Accesaries not includedCase-$20-$45(included with Sony's and RCA's)USB cable-$30(included with Sony's and RCA's)No free songs(30 free with Sony's Walkman digital music player)Dock $40(included with Sony's and RCA's)"

3,ipod U2,"So i did my research on this ipod making sure it's what I wanted to spend my money on. The ipod U2 edition is $350. It came with a $50 coupon to what the Amazon called iTunes. I thought great i can buy more songs with this coupon! I knew that ipods were good and went ahead and bought the ipod U2 edition. The coupon that comes with ipod can ONLY be used toward ""the complete U2""($150 box set). You can not use it for anything else. If you want a 20 gig ipod just buy the normal ipod for $300 and save $50. I have nothing against ipods but the U2 edition is a waste of $50."
2,Not enough detail,"I was a little disappointed with the book. Wanted a little more details and somemore solved examples. This book only introduces FT. It is a good book for the introductory classes in Physics and engineering, after that it is useless."
3,Borrow from library,"This book is fine if you are just brushing up on fourier analysis, but it is not a good book to learn fourier analysis from scratch. There are very few proofs, and you have to read between the lines much more than should be necessary in an introductory (basic) book. There are a few places where the explanations are just terrible (e.g. sampling theorem, some of the applications, etc.). Borrow this book from the library, but don't spend money on it is my advice."
1,Not a good choice,"I must agree with several of the other reviewers. The book assumes that the student knows too much about the subject. This would not be a good choice as a text for teaching a student about Fourier Analysis and transforms. If the reader has a real interest to learn the basics as well as the more in-depth the theorems, where they come from and why they work, a solid systematic approach can be found in the text by to Norman Morrison."
1,Not A Reliable Device,"60GB = IPaperweightI loved it while it worked, but it doesn't seem to work long. I've had 2 of these - each lasted ~7mo. before the drive croaked and began generating ""Internal Disk Errors"" that prevent the device from being reset, reformatted, or in any way accessed by ITunes or my computer. Apple's warranty is good only 1 yr. from the date of purchase. It covered the 1st one but not the 2nd. ~$250 to repair. I now refer to it as the IPaperweight."
2,Wait for the next revision,"I purchased this item from my local dealer and was disappointed for 2 big reasons. #1 The device does not allow one to listen to music which flipping through photos. I thought this would be an obvious inclusion!! #2 There are no memory card slots to easily upload pictures from ones digital camera (most people that are travelling dont their pcs with them). Needless to say I returned the product and will be empty handed on the subway until Apple ""fixes"" these issues."
1,My God it is Frozen,"Yea, I got this item awhile ago and it was cool and everything until it started to do wierd things, like freeze for a few seconds. Right now it is totally frozen and I'm pissed off. It has been frozen for two hours. I'm waiting for the battery to die right now. I'll probably get rid of it soon."
1,IPODS STINK!!,Had a 4th gen 40 gig that just causes me headaches. Sent in 3 times to apple and now it does not connect to crappy itunes software.I am ebaying the ipod and getting a creative.I hate ipods!
3,Di'anno-Nomad,"Let me start off by stating that I was hoping for a recording that was going to sound something like the first two Iron Maiden albums. To my suprise it does not, but thats not to say it isn't a good recording. It's average sounding metal music, in the likes of Judas Priest or Overkill, but it kind of lacks the personality of those groups. Highlighted songs(in my opinion are) THE LIVING DEAD, S.A.T.A.N., and MAD MAN IN THE ATTIC. Above all it's pretty good, it's just not what I was expecting."
3,The writing is great but Paul isn't a screamer!,"Paul just doesn't sound as good as on other albums (Killers, Battlezone, and Maiden!)The music and songs are really well done and are worth giving a chance if you are in to the heavier side of Paul then this will be a God send! But unlike Rob Halford who can sing anything and especially the heavier stuff, Paul just can't give it what Rob can! On certain songs he sounds a little horse and gritty but I do love the songs and playing!"
4,Check it out,"Excellent DVD if looking to teach yourself drums in a hurry, a very thorough guide to getting started."
4,"Great voice, but not a Siegfried.","I was greatly disappointed in the voice of Siegried. He rather sounds more like an old man than a young hero. At times I can't tell the difference between Siefried, and Mime. Berens has a more powerful voice than Goldburg and so in the last act it is a bit mis-matched."
4,"Very good service, wrong product.","I thought I was ordering a slide holder that would fit my Carasol Projectoe, The Service was very good."
5,Our greatest essayist,"Having already reviewed Ozick's other essay collections, I have little to say about Fame & Folly, a wholly splendid book. But I do want to point out that the reviewer who evaluated Fame & Folly solely in terms of its author's feminism (s/he found Ozick insufficiently feminist) did a disservice to those who want some idea of the nature of the book. Fame & Folly does not aspire to be a feminist tract, despite the fact that Ozick is as liberated a woman as you could find (incidentally, her earlier collection Art & Ardor contains several essays in praise of classical feminism). It is a defense of, a hymn to, belles lettres. She writes about Henry James. She writes about Saul Bellow. She recalls her friendship with the late writer Alfred Chester. She shows, in every sentence, why she is America's foremost essayist."
3,Defect in MSD cap,"I've had this on my car for a while now and it works great! There's only one potential problem. MSD places a plug on the inside of the cap, on the point where the input from the blaster coil comes in. This plug came unglued in my distributor cap and dropped down into the distributor, where it was flung into the tach sensor--destroying it.MSD was kind enough to send me a replacement cap/rotor, but I was out of luck on the distributor, and had to buy another one."
4,Stallone is top notch,"Stallone is and has always been a fine actor.I agree when some say he strayed away from it over the years,but to say he is bad and be surprised that he can do good work is an insult.His performance in this very entertaining and epic drama is perfect example(while films like Tango & Cash are examples of ""just pay me""Stallone).I'm never surprised when he is great in a film,I'm more surprised when he coasts through.Check this film out if you want to be entertained,and watch an underated thespian at his best."
3,A film which deserved an even better status!,The first and principal aspect to remark is that we are on front of the most distinguished performance ever made in previous or late entries of Sylvester Stallone. But the script (despite the magisterial direction of Norman Jewison) unexplainably lacked of punch and expressive forcer. The resemblances with On the waterfront are too many. And that was pitifully its own perdition.
4,good quality,"I got the DVD in a sqare cardboard box and the DVD was held well incased in a plastic slim casing with the picture and title in front. The movie came out very well and in good quality, I was pleased. The price was inexpensive and I hope to do more buisiness in the future with you."
3,"Lovely writing, with an acute ethnic sense","This is a collection of stories by a fine writer who comes up with various ways to tell the same story over and over--the experience of being Japanese-American. Funny, in a way, because Sasaki (according to the endpaper in the book) is sansei, or third-generation American. But she is acutely aware of her background.The best story in this book is ""First Love,"" which is basically an epiphany. It has a New-Yorker-story finish that just sort of trails off......but is nicely done up to that point"
5,Very Helpful,"If primary schools deeply engaged the message in this book, radical changes would be seen in middle school students' ability to work algebraically, use integers, manipulate data, and engage mathematically with a wide variety of topics. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series. Very well written and full of meaningful classroom examples."
5,Just What I was Looking For,I have been looking for a unit that will play both DVDs and VHS tapes. I have a pretty good-sized collection of DVDs and pre-recorded VHS tapes. This SONY unit fits the bill. I can play everything with this single unit. I can still record tapes off the cable too if I wish. One remote handles everything. I can also hook this unit to my TV using an RF cable or RCA type cables if I wish. You do not get that option with a stand-alone DVD player. So far I am very pleased with this unit. All my tapes look very good and the Fast Forward and Rewind is very fast. The price is right to.
3,Be Warned: The Remote Requires Accurate Aiming,"The remote control might drive you batty. You have to point it directly at whatever it's controlling in order for it to work. Besides the obvious, this means that unless you've memorized the buttons and can feel which is which, you must hold the remote level and then lean forward to read its labels and press its buttons.Otherwise, the thing is nice. I like the fact that its remote is actually a universal remote that can control channel, volume, and power to many makes & models of TV, including my 15-year-old Panasonic. We're finally able to use a single remote for the TV and its media player while still having full access to the media player's features, such as ""subtitles on/off""."
5,nice item!!,"this is a dvd/vcr combo with progressive scan. it works beautifully and was a breeze to hook up. it is also very easy to work, even for the technologically challenged. the price was quite reasonable. we very pleased with this purchase."
1,Sony SLVD370P VCR problems,"Let me start by saying that I always buy Sony products and I have been very happy with them. This product, unfortunately is the exception.I purchased this DVD/VCR combo mainly for the VCR function, but within the first week I had problems with the quality of the picture on the VCR during playback. When I paused the tape I could see that there was definitely a problem because a 4-head VCR should still have a clear picture on pause, and this did not.I exchanged the unit for the same item, and this time the VCR taped well, but within the first week it made a horrible noise during rewinding which only got worse with each use.I had two different problems with two different units within a month. Save yourself the headache and get a different DVD/VCR combo."
2,It didn't last long...,"Well... it was a great product for a month until it crapped out. Before that it provided great video quality, good recording quality, and was (to me) intuitively easy to use. I was, overall, very happy with it. Then the DVD player started going (skipping, scambled digital signals/picture/sound, etc). Once the DVD player went, the VCR went right after or about the same time. It was hard to tell, because the VCR wasn't used as much. Right now, it makes for a nice big paper weight. What a piece of junk. My final comment: Hey Sony, if you want to get into the low end market and sell your products cheap, make sure they perform up to your reputation and customer's expectations of your quality. This was an experience that will make me think twice before buying another Sony product - despite my many years of good experiences with their products."
3,Order review,I received the wrong item. I contacted the seller and returned the item and received a credit on my credit card. I received polite and courtesy service on the return or the product that was sent to me.
3,DVD/VCR,"Well I am okay with this product, except when came to fixing the romate and the vcr/dvd player on the same code. I think over all it is pretty good."
4,Yes Indeed,"I truly cannot proufess how much I love this eloquent DVD/VCR Prougressive Scan Combo Player. It succinctly plays my favourite Digital Versatile Discs of Operas, Plays, and Broadway Musicals, and also plays JPEG CD-ROMs taken from my electrounic digital camera at said perfourmances. My only criticism, however, is that it doesn't play Region 2 dirty movies. How am I s'posed to watch ""Debbie does Denmark"" on this dang thing? I ended up throwing the DVD in a tire fire started behind my trailer house by my neighbors."
1,Lasted about 1 1/2 Years on the DVD Part,"Pros:-Excellent machine but did not last. (My last SONY from 2000 lasted till beginning of 2006.)-VHS has super fast rewind and playback. It'll last a long time.Cons:-DVD player is not meant to play a lot of DVDs. The VHS side could last for 100 years.Not worth the $150 I paid for it. If used, DON'T BUY IT SINCE THEY ARE SELLING PROBABLY BECAUSE THE DVD PLAYER IS GOING. When the DVD player goes, it starts to say, ""No disc"" a lot then stops entirely."
1,Sony DVD/VCR player only works part of the time,"Don't buy this. The VCR part worked okay at first, but then stopped working. We got the refurbished product, so the warranty is over.I won't buy Sony refurbs again. Sony used to stand for good quality, but apparently that attention to detail is slipping."
2,remote point and shoot,it plays well easy to set up and lives up to the name of sonythis is the 2nd of the same item but the remote in both sonysyou might as well be sitting on it to have the remotes to workdvd part nothing special but vcr player works very well.next player it does not need to be a sony
2,Could Use Better Manual,Should have had a better written manual so operation could be easier. This is hard to figure out.
4,"Plays all media, but color off","I bought this unit to play homemade CD's & DVD's that my older unit wouldn't read. It serves its purpose. However, when watching pre-recorded rented DVD movies, the color, contrast, etc. was horrible. I kept switching between the pre-set A/V settings and found none that were acceptable. After reading the lengthy, confusing operating instructions cover-to-cover, I finally switched on the ""black level"" screen setup (changed from default ""off"" position), which helped some, but I'm still not real happy with the color.Initial connection configuration was very difficult to figure out from the instruction booklet and extra insert. If the unit continues to perform as it has so far, I'll be happy with it, although I'm still using my old Sony to view rented DVD movies."
1,Bad Quality,"Not very happy with this purchase. Rewind is so loud you'd think a jet is flying through your home. Pause doesnt give a clear picture, its all lines across the top of the screen. As soon as you turn it on with Video enabled, your TV screens quality gets terrible. Also theres no tuner so i cannot record one thing while i watch another.No wonder its so cheap. You get what you pay for. This will be a secondary player in the bedroom. Ill have to get another for the living room. Its not broken so i cant return it based on its crummy quality. Its cheap, and theres a reason for it. Now I know."
2,Disappointed,"This product could be a lot better.I bought it to free up space on my entertainment center by replacing a Sony DVD player and a 4-year old Sony VCR. And after 2 weeks of use I'm back to my old setup.The DVD next chapter function pauses for a second before going to the next chapter. The VCR commercial skip skips to the middle of the next commercial rather than the beginning; so, when you get back to the show you had taped, you have to rewind for serveral seconds. And, if you fast forward manually, there is a pause before the fast forward stops after letting up on the button. Causing you to rewind to get back to where you want to go.Also, unlike my older (1-year) Sony DVD player, every time you put in a DVD, even one that had been in the player before, the unit will play the unable-to-be-skipped title graphics and FBI warning.I would recommend passing on this one."
1,What a piece of trash,"Well, bought Sony because of its reputation in the electronics industry. Will not buy Sony because there is no basis for its reputation in the electronics industry. Had problems with this as soon as it came out of the box, new. Called customer service and the person there apparently thought I was stupid and so he felt he had to yell at me during the ""conversation"". The purpose for the call never got addressed. So, I continued to use this piece of junk until it started to eat my tapes. Called again and then the solution was for me to ship the defective one to Sony and then pay for another plus shipping. I told them no and destroyed it to take it out of recycling. Bought a Philips unit which I am very, very happy with."
4,Sony DVD/VCR Combo Player,"The player was very easy to hook-up to the television, and is easy to operate; however the VCR is no longer needed with the new plasma TVs. One could save money just buying a DVD."
2,Annoying noise,"It seems to work fine but the DVD player makes a loud, irritating whirring noise. It's very distracting."
2,"If you like slow, this unit is for you!","I needed a minimal unit to play old VHS and DVDs. We have a sophisticated HDD/DVD-recorder Tivo-like device which plays DVDs, its slow to boot, andtoo complicated for everyone else in my family to use as a DVD player.Our old Sony VCR died from old age. We have a Sony DVD player on another TV set.This unit is not as good as either of the stand-alone units.What I find most annoying is how slow it is. I'm not talking rewind etc., I'm just talking how long it takes to boot up. It takes 20 seconds to start up.I find the remote to be a pain to use. I constantly hit the wrong buttons.I wish I had bought some other VHS/DVD unit."
3,Awkward,"This is a cheaply made tool with all kinds of irregularities--looks like a ""second"" at best. Very awkward to change the blades or rotate them. Most of these are dangerous and this no exception. You have to loosen the whole assembly, which makes it very dicey. Not for kids, klutzes or the distracted. Does small jobs okay but wouldn't want to use it all day."
1,unbelievable,"I'm sorry, I'm not this stupid. In order to get the description tag off of the knife, I had to disassemble the entire knife. I have failed to assemble it properly. Of all the insanely over packaged items I've bought in the last decade, this tops them all by a long shot. Unbelievable."
3,Nice Workmanship,"Smaller than expected. Seems a little fragile (the antennae) and difficult for small hands. I wish I had ordered the turtle instead. It was a bit pricey, but the woodwork is nicely done."
2,"NOT BAD, BUT NOT GOOD","After shredding only 10 to 15 documents, this thing will easily overheat and shut off for 15 minutes. I had a stack of documents I wanted to shred, so this made things quite annoying. Otherwise, it's a decent little machine. I recommended avoiding this product though unless you plan on shredding only a few documents at a time."
1,Not worth paying for,"Over heats after 10 sheets, and now after 2 mos use it will not work at all, contacted the company and they wanted me to ship it back to them for review, stay away from purchasing this one"
2,Okay for a $100 unit.,Pros:Design is simple and clean. No flashy buttons or rainbow lights.The display is easy to read in both daylight and dark.Lots of power for a head unit.Remote control.Cons:FF and RW buttons are tiny. Hard to find when driving.CD eject/insert motor is painfully slow.Mediocre sound quality. Rudimentary EQ.Detachable faceplate is clunky. Hard to get on and off.
5,A lovely storybook to complement a wonderful lullaby!,"What could be better than my favorite lullaby in the form of a storybook? The illustrations literally sail you far away into a dream world as the words/lyrics from the song guide you through this magical voyage on Lull-a-Bye Bay.As a bonus too, Mr. Robert B. and Mr. Richard M. Sherman have written a second verse exclusively for this book. What a treat!"
4,good trouble free heater,"I just bought one of these to heat my 24x36' shop, and it does a great job. One issue I have with it doesn't appear to like biodiesel. It smokes a lot and just doesn't seem to produce as much heat as when kerosene or diesel are used, and much more smoke. And I'll second the other reviewer who says that when you use diesel you get plenty of warmth, but feel like you are trying to commit suicide via exhaust fumes! If you open your door(s) and/or windows a bit more you may be able to tolerate it.I haven't installed a CO detector yet, but also worry about breathing other particulates too, so keep ventilation in mind and be familiar with the symptoms of CO poisoning just in case."
2,Disappointing set,"This is a disappointing set. While Levine succeeds to draw some fine playing from the orchestra, the soloists are far from adequate. Goldberg's Siegfried is really dreadful and Behrens is sorely taxed by Brunnhilde's music. Other members of the cast are average."
4,hm,"I like it a lot, but it's really cheap that there aren't 50 songs on it. Big disappointment. However, The Faint's ""Take Me to the Hospital"" might be the coolest techno song ever. Excluding stuff off the Trainspotting soundtrack and Bright Eyes' ""Digital Ash in a Digital Urn""."
4,Love the Chief,"Chief is without a doubt our favorite curry powder and I was pleased to see it offered on Amazon (although it is often out of stock). The only negative is the price but since I don't have anywhere to get it other than Trinidad, I guess it is reasonable if one considers the airfare for a round trip ticket to Trinidad.This curry is not spicy-hot although you can certainly add some heat to it if you desire. Curry is a blend of spices, so curries can vary. Chief curry powder contains Coriander, cumin, garlic, tumeric, fenugreek, ani, and ajwa. It is a yellowish-green color when it is cooked with chicken or shrimp and onions.Using this curry powder all you need to do to make curried chicken is lightly sear some chicken pieces in oil, add as much onion as you like, make a paste out of the curry powder (about 4 T depending on your taste) using the liquid in the pan, then cover it all with some chicken broth and cook until the meat falls apart. Serve over rice."
4,Dysfunctional family?,"the one who wrote that this was the most dysfunctional family probably hasn't looked around much.. this was a GREAT movie... sure it was dysfunction times ten, but whose family isn't.. loved the movie... Great acting, great characters.. Vincent D'Onofrio was GREAT! as usual he took his character over the edge!"
3,A secret discovered...,"Crooked Hearts is a cautionary tale of a reasonably loving but slightly dysfunctional family where the parents, in an attempt to nurture their children have, in fact, stifled them. However, one of them has a secret that, due to lack of communication and misunderstanding, eventually leads to tragedy when it is revealed. It is how they all deal with this heartbreak and their reactions to it and each other that makes for an interesting story. At first glance it appears to be a lighthearted film but it gets darker and more satisfying.A clever insight into how good intentions can sometimes go horribly wrong."
2,Not bad,I blame the dad. It is his fault for all of the pain and lost the family went threw. If he wasn't having a secret romance with Janetta then his oldest son wouldn't have found out and have so much hate tours his dad. His oldest son wouldn't have burned their house down. His youngest son wouldn't have been hit by a car and died. Because he was trying to burn the love letters between his father and Janetta. This is a sad story about a family going threw so much pain all because of the fathers secret life.
3,Pricey,I love Sugar Daddy's and they are hard to find in the stores except at Halloween time. I have found them in specialty candy stores but are pricey there too. The packs of 48 are the small ones and I didn't realize that until they came in the mail. I enjoyed eating them but wouldn't buy again because of the price. I have recently found a store locally that carries the larger size that are not to pricey. I will be buying them there from now on. If you are a lover of Sugar Daddy's and don't mind paying the price you won't be disappointed with the taste. The ones I ordered tasted great!
5,Hard to find item...,I can't locate these anywhere around my area. I picked them up to keep in a bowl in the living room. They are fresh and my son's friends seem to really like them!!!
3,"Not what I was expecting, but good nonetheless...","This CD was simply a random buy because the girl on the cover is STARING rather interestingly at me. She happened to be in a well worn route on my way through work, so I had to pick her up.It's good music.It's well thought out.Her vocals are killer.It's just not my type of music. I love the laid back stuff, like Goldfrapp, IMogen Heap and Helicopter Girl. But this is just a bit TOO laid back for me.There is a good solid track that I love on the CD, which is ""Dial"". It's kinda heavy, and I love the vocal effects on that song. One of my favorites.Other than that, if you're into chill, lounge music, that's much more toned down than Goldfrapp, go for this. It's good stuff. Perfect lounge music."
4,"This book is slightly overrated, actually","There is no denying the importance of John Cage as a composer as well as a writer. But even though this book is a necessary provocation for anyone who thinks they know what music is and should be, he is not a philosopher, and his ideas are often contradictory, naive and even romantic.Romantic? Yes, I would say that for instance his idea of ""sounds in themselves"" and ""nature"" are romantic. Can we really eliminate all cultural impact and distortion just by refusing intention? I think not. Sounds are always inflected by history.Still, I would not want a world without the challenge of his extreme stance."
5,Exceptional book; insights that apply to more than art.,"This is the only book of Cage's I have read, but I found it not only cleared up any questions I had about the nature and intention of his work, but also gave me a much greater appreciation of what a true pioneer he was, both as an artist and philosopher. His humor and passion for life and art are in clear evidence throughout the book; each article or lecture reveals a new facet, a new layer of his boundless creativity and powerful stand for all art. Even though parts of the book may get fairly technical, much of what he says about music applies to life in general and to the goal of pursuing both to their fullest. A must-have for any serious musician or lover of art and life."
1,don't buy the Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition is just a collection of scanned pages. The text doesn't reflow, and doesn't zoom. It is microscopic on an ordinary Kindle. The book is marked as ""optimized for large screens"" but it is really just an extremely lazy attempt at an ebook. I expected reflowable text and a few large images of Cage's visual scores. What I got was unusable on my Kindle."
1,Full of errors!,"The Spanish in this book is full of errors. Just look at the sample pages: ""el nariz"" (should be ""la nariz""); ""la cuerpa"" (should be ""el cuerpo""). These are BIG mistakes which would have been caught by any native speaker, so I can only assume that no Spanish speaker collaborated on this book. And those are just the most glaring errors - there are other places where it's obvious they've translated straight from English without bothering to find out how something is really said in Spanish. Steer clear of this book!"
4,Well made shoes,"These shoes are well made and very comfortable. The metal buckle can sometimes get twisted and rub the top of my foot, but other than that the shoes are great."
5,a mom,This is a wonderful book that introduces the saints to young children through song and pictures they love to look at. My four yr. old loves this book.
2,"Sweet & simple, especially if you are musically inclined","This is not a bad book, but I thought there would be more substance to it. I like the illustrations, the pictures almost say more than the words. In the back there is a little bit more information on the particular saints the book refers to. I cannot read music, but maybe if you are into music this book would be better suited for your family as you could actually sing the song that is in it!Please also note this book is SO NOT worth the ridiculous prices people put up!! You will be really mad if you pay more than $10.00 for this book! I personally would not pay more than $3-4 plus shipping of course!"
3,A brief but mediocre introduction to the major revolutions of the world over the past 2 centuries,"This book provides a brief introduction to all the world's major revolutions over the past two centuries. The book starts with the American and French revolutions and continues through its publication date (Afganistan's fight against the Soviet Union). Each revolution is covered in 4 pages, no matter the complexity, length or importance of the revolution.Another problem of the book is that it does not examine (or ask the question) of why foreign powers have almost always lost thier imperial wars, the trends in technology, the role of media and the ""human rights"" card, or even the military forces involved or the political situation at the beginning of the war."
5,Great bar for the price,"As far as superbike style bars go, these are probably top of the line in my opinion. Most folks want either chrome, or gloss black bars. I was pleased to find a different flavor and for roughly the same cost as the Chinese bars made from questionable metal.The finish seems very durable too. THe flat gold hasn't so much as scratched while installing my controls and windscreen brackets.Overall, very very please with my purchase."
5,A Must Read for anyone on their spiritual journey,"JJ Dewey is one talented writer! The Immortal books I & II, along with the Lost Key of Buddha, helped to open my eyes to my spirituality, it confirmed many things I believed in and suspected about life and ""why we are here"", and how to overcome our ego and emotions, to build a stronger spiritual body.I would recommend this book to EVERYONE, anyone who is seeking more in life, to those who ask ""why am I here"", ""what is my purpose."" It is a must read...you will NOT be disappointed...be ready to be challenged!"
5,The Journey Continues,"Note: Please see my review off JJ Deweys first book (Immortal I & II).I also recommend that you read The Immortal I & II (one book) first before reading The Lost Key of the Buddha.Final recommendation: Purchase both and read the Immortal I & II first! (grin), as Book 4 is in the process of being written!All the foregoing recommendations aside, The Lost Key of the Buddha (Book 3) is no less full of the drama, intrique and knowledge than JJ Dewey's The Immortal I & II. It is both a continuation of the story, the quest, *and* the continued offering of additional ""keys of knowledge"" which can be practically and reasonably applied to a variety of situations encountered on a day-to-day basis.It is simply more light shed along the path. So, if you are looking for more light to be shed on you as you journey along your path, then I suspect that you'll find The Lost Key of the Buddha a necessary source of that light."
5,The Lost Key of Buddha,Outstanding!!! This is the third book of the Immortal series and it just keeps getting better and better! This book and the two previous have moved me in a way I never thought possible. The truth is revealed in a way that the whole world can understand it! All of Humanity should make this book and the Immortal series a must read! You will not be disappointed!
1,Item is not a 5-pack STAY AWAY!,"I ordered this 5-pack and only received a single brush. When I called the seller they said the listing was wrong that the item is indeed a single and not a 5-pack. They offered to refund the cost, but not the shipping."
3,"OK, but too small and not as nice as matching hoop earrings","The pendant would be a lot nicer if it were a bit larger. I just compared the diameter to some coins, and it's smaller than a penny and slightly larger than a dime."
4,New information to me,"I hadn't ever heard of the knights of malta, but not many have. This is no accident. This basically exposes the group & sheds light on their history...they are not unlike many secret societies, but they are VERY interesting in that they are SUPER hush-hush. Have YOU ever heard of them? Probably not. I'm just saying."
1,Would Have Rated it Zero Stars if I Could,"One of the stupidest and nonsensical ""documentaries"" that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The DVD espouses typical anti-Catholic rants and fantasies that characterize fanatical fundamentalist hallucinations and unrealities.This is 66 minutes of my life wasted watching this nonsense..."
3,Secret Society Revealed,"This documentary asserts that many of the problems we experience today can be traced back to the eleventh century when European Christian zealots went on a killing spree against Jews, Muslims, and all those they considered ""unenlightened."" This, the producers say, was the result of the breakdown of original core Christian beliefs at the rise of the radical Catholic Church. Learn about the Knights of Malta, a secret society whose name evolved, but whose motives remained sinister and linked to the occult."
4,Secret Society,"The Knights of Malta seem to have been called by several different titles over the years, but what appears consistent from this documentary is that it was a secret society whose motives remained sinister and linked to the occult. Also discussed is the rise of the radical Catholic Church and the collapse of earlier Christian values and beliefs."
4,"Some Flaws, but still Fun","Every other golf game i have played was horrible. i could never get the hang of it. Then when i played Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 for the Wii, i really got into it. Even though it is so simple to hit the ball, its brilliant. You actually feel like you're hitting the ball. My only complaint is that the system sometimes doesn't respond well to your swing. Sometimes, you'll move your arms back and swing forward, but your golfer still has his arms in the air. But it is not all that bad. This is one of the best golf games out there."
3,Fun Game with *Frustrating* Control Issues,"After playing Tiger Woods for a week, I'm starting to get pretty decent with the gameplay. Hitting a straight shot just takes practice. However, no matter how perfect a swing you have, every so often (usually a couple times per 18 holes) the golfer will swing before you finish your backswing. It is so completely frustrating to have this happen when you're neck-and-neck with the pros on a tour stop that you'll want to throw your Wii-mote at the screen and curse EA's quality control.Other than this egregious control issue, the game is actually quite good. It's fun to use the Wii-mote to swing the club, although for those of us that actually golf, it takes a little adaptation from a true golf swing. If EA fixes its controller issue for next year, the game will be much better. In the meantime, prepare to be frustrated."
4,"A lot of fun, but patience required for the learning curve","Tiger Woods 07 is a lot of fun, but it is not easy. The controls take practice and patience to pick up, and even then it is still hard. It is true that the player will occasionally hit the ball when you don't want it too, but that is usually because the player did not swing correctly. Once I got the swing down, this became a rare occurence.A lot of people say the graphics are bad, but I think they look great. Not super realistic, but not PS1 or older quality. Looks good to me. I don't see ny pixelation, etc.Great game, glad to have it."
3,my bad,"I bought this game for my Dad for Father's Day a few years ago (I know, late in reviewing) and it turns out the NEW Tiger Woods game was to be released just a couple months later. My bad. Dad ended up buying the new one anyway, so I guess this version was just a trial run. Whatever. I support amazon.com and people who drive into trees."
3,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07,The game is okay. I was expecting more. The controls are inconsistent. My son and I like the 360 game better.
2,good ideas. poor execution.,"I am going to keep it short and sweet. It should be easy to make a good golf game with the wii remote. Here is where EA went wrong I think.1. Graphics are lacking even for the wii.2. No left handed option. You can swing left handed, but your ball will slice right a lot. I mean a lot.3. You need to watch the screen to hit the ball. very counter-intuitive for real golfers.4. the menu system is very unintuitive.That game is not unplayable. Its actually kind of fun once you get to the course and your able to hit with the power that you want to hit with and everything registers okay. unfortuatly the other half of the time it is very frustrating."
4,"Can be frustrating, just like real golf.","If you want to relive the real experience of mis-hitting the ball, this is the game for you. When I play golf in real life (rarely) I usually slice. Well, the same thing was happening to me last night while playing Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07. However, when I concentrated on what my hands were doing during the swing, I could nail it nice and straight. As far as realism goes, this game is 80% there, hence the 4 stars overall. Putting is where the problem is, but that's understandable, considering how delicate a putting stroke is, hence the difficulty in the Wiimote emulating it. I know that this game has potential for hundreds of hours of gameplay, and overall I'm very excited about it. Just don't throw your controller to the ground when you keep hitting it into the rough!EDIT: After playing more last night and getting the putting down, I would like to change my score to a 5 out of 5 overall. Easily worth the $50 investment!"
1,I know this topic has been beaten to death lately...,"But something needs to be said. The reason I'm writing this review is that Tiger Woods uses deception to trick people into voting against things that they, in fact, support. Before examining the present situation, however, it is important that I tell it like it is. Lest you think that I'm talking out of my hat here, I should point out that he twists every argument into some sort of ""struggle"" between two parties. Tiger unvaryingly constitutes the underdog party, which is what he claims gives him the right to promote the total destruction of individuality in favor of an all-powerful group. Now that I've said what I had to say, I should remark that this review may not endear me to some people. Indeed, it may even cost me a friend or two. However, friends do not let friends get trampled by batty tightwads like Tiger Woods. The truth is the truth and we pay a steep price whenever we ignore it."
3,"Despite a few issues, still very fun...","The bad: less than average graphics for the Wii (other than player animations),some sporadic controller issues, skimpy manual / in game information.The good: Challenging game with several different play modes, swing parameters and quirks not unlike real life (for me, anyway).This isn't an extension of Wii Golf; it does take an investment in time and has a few annoying quirks, which I got pretty upset with at first. But the payoff has been worth it for me and I'm glad I got the game.I can generally avoid the early-putting bug by being very careful not to press B and move until I'm ready to putt. On drives, I put my club as far back as I want in a seperate motion from swinging forward - I've had good luck with that and actually it's pretty close to what I had to do in the real world."
3,Tiger Woods 07,"The game is fun to play, but the instructions in the small book that came with it are not very helpful and setting up the game is extremely difficult. I still have not found my way to changing to different golf courses."
2,Glitchy controls,"For some odd reason the golfer will randomly swing at the ball (duffing it way off couse) while the Wiimote is pointed straight at the sky with the B button FIRMLY pressed. Highly frustated!!!! The controls in the menu screens are really hard to use as well. This game had potential to be freakin sweet, but it fell short."
2,Wait for Wii Sports 2,"I assumed this game would have the same controls as the golf in Wii Sports, maybe even better, and that's what broke my heart. Everything else about this game is great, but the controls just kill it."
3,Fun mixed with controller-induced extreme frustration,"The game has a lot of great elements to it, but when so much of the time the controller either does a backswing or jerks the club forward hitting the ball at 50% into a sand trap or behind a tree after going 90 degrees off course, you actually need a breather to avoid spazzing out.The golf with wii sports would do this, as well, but not nearly as often.Control for the interface is also really really bad. Trying to ""pick out an outfit"" (or buy things in the pro shop) is equally frustrating.Buy it used to play with a friend, but don't pay retail for this bugginess."
2,This game sucks!,"...and I'm usually not very critical but they controls were awful. I'm a huge fan of the past offerings of this game. This one just didn't cut it. Using the nunchuk is tons better than using the wiimote but it still lacks considerably compared to say the 2004 ps2 edition. Putting, OMG, and hitting a half-swing shot is impossible with the wiimote. I'll give it a two because it's there first offering with the wii and honestly I'm glad that they released this game for the wii but I can't deny that I was dissappointed. Like and earlier post, I was worried that I'd mess up my real golf swing trying to adapt to this game and it's inaccurate controls. I haven't sliced a ball in God knows how long but I was a regular ""hack"" on this game. My advise would be to rent first even if your a long standing fan of the series. Approach with caution...."
2,Wii Tiger golf,"Graphics are real grainny, poor quality gets old real quick. Needs work should be really cool in a couple of Versions. But now my guys dont even bother with it."
3,A Promising but Flawed Golf Simulation,"After playing Tiger Woods 07 for the Wii for a week now, I think that I can sum up what bothers me about the game: unlike real golf, where you are trained to always look down when swinging, TW07 forces you to look at the screen. On occasion, the game will drift into a swing, even thought the Wiimote is in the down, starting position. The solution is to release the B button and start again if this occurs. Putting also appears to be occasionally out of sync with the Wiimote, forcing you to look at your screen character while putting. The game also will occasionally not let you hit the ball hard enough to reach the cup, which is very frustrating (it will, however, let you chip while on the green). These flaws will frustrate serious golfers, as they take it out of the realm of simulation, making it just a good game. Here's hoping that TW08 fixes these problems."
3,needs improvement,"I only bought this game the other day. It's def a great game idea with the whole wii effect but the game is really not made well enough. Let me explain why, when you go to putt it just goes to pull back without you even moving I think it's cause the whole sensor thing. to sum this up the game is def cool and a great buy but I would like to see how they can improve this game."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - IT'S BUGGED!!,"This game at first looks seems amazing, but as you play it, you bump into the swing bug. If you want to play the game where you actually use the controller as a golf club, you ""lose"" swings. Occasionally, (about 4 times in a 9 hole round for me), the game misses your swing. You take your backswing as normal, but when you bring it around for the hit, the game jumps the gun and hits it too early. This results in a weak, off target shot.I can't think of anything more frustrating than to play a good hole right up to the short shot and then have the game mess up in this way, causing you to lose the hole and possibly the match.In short, this game is bugged. Don't buy it!"
4,OK,Graphics-6/10Sound-8/10control-7/10overall fun 8/10If you like the wii sports golf and want to kick it up a notch TW 07 is a good upgrade. Graphics are a little on the weak side but the wii is not known for superior graphics. It has a learning curve of about 30-40 minutes.
4,Looks very classy,Nice appearance and quality. It fits the American Standard toilet exactly - side mount makes most other styles unable to work out.
1,Not worth it,"This thing is cheap junk, not worth the price. Plus I've seen this same product for much cheaper from other sellers. I would definitely look elsewhere."
3,order messed up,"The product is fine, except that the next day I received a duplicate shipment. I returned it, but am faced with the freight costs. Not happy at all!!!!!!! I still have not received a credit.I imagine that nobody reads these comments anyway!"
4,Good,"This seems to be the ONLY slide sorter available, but it is good. I previously had one for many years. The only problem is the plastic front coming off, even with the little bungee cords they provide."
4,Sorter,"My only complaint is that the indentation holding the slides is too shallow and if you do not place the slide firmly it tends to slip out of the indentation and fall. Other than that, it works well for reviewing slides."
5,Excellent,"I bought my husband a very expensive slide sorter last year. He hated it. Too small, too hard to use. So I bought him this one, just like his dad had 40 years ago. He loves this and it's making his slide sorting project a lot more fun and less of a chore."
3,"Flimsey, I would not buy again",I felt that it was very flimsey. It works and I am glad for that. I would not buy again
4,"the slide sorter is fine, but don't buy suggested lamp or transformer!","I recently purchased the Logan Slide Sorter, which is fairly old tech, but very helpful in deciding which of the thousands of slides from my parents and my family that I want to scan and save to CD.I just wanted to warn other purchasers that the suggested Panavue Transformer and Panavue Replacement Lamp that are recommended on the Amazon site, to be purchased with the Logan Slide Sorter, are TOTALLY incompatible for the Logan Slide Sorter. Do not order them, or you will have to go through the hassle of not only returning them, but paying the return postage!"
5,Simple and practical,"This is a sturdy, easy-to-assemble (less than a minute) slide-sorting aid. Using a flourescent lightbulb keeps the heat-production to a minimum. I especially like that it folds flat for storage."
3,It works,"It works, tends to come apart when you move it so don't try with slides on th sorter. A little brighter light than what is recommended will help with darker slides I tried a compact floresent bulb which has less heat."
1,very cheap,"I was very disappointed with this product. The frame is made of cheap styrofoam. When it arrived it was damaged and dented in several places. The ""easel stand"" is just a thin piece of cardboard that isn't even close to functional. What a waste. Needless to say I'm returning immediately."
3,Not Karajan's Best-try 1976 DG,"This recording was made in the 1960's. Karajan re-recorded it in 1976 (available as part of a DG ""Panorama"" of Berlioz favorites). That is the performance to own. The execution is better, the sound has greater dynamic range, and the interpetation is more macabre. Although he doesn't take the 1st movement repeat, and doesn't use the optional coronet parts in the 2nd movement, I like the 1976 as much as the C. Davis version from about the same time."
4,The perfect bells...,"Regardless of the very particular style of Karajan conducting the most well known works from seldom composers, in this recording he achieved the most in one of the best performances of the Berlioz's Symphony Fantastique.The reason is simple: No other conductor but him could feel the overwhelming sense of the death that an artist lives when tries to suicide, and in his trial there are bells driving himself through a gateway toward his fatal destiny.There could be thousands of bells used to perform this work, but once you ""live"" the sound of the ones Karajan use, all others are worthless.Maybe this is not the finest version but it really has a highly interesting improvement in the last movement. Anyone who wants to listen the very sound of a Night of Sabath, must try this recording..."
5,No problem with Mac OS x,"I read the reviews of the HD-338D-U2 out of curiosity. I'll simply say that I have had this enclosure for almost two years. I never have used the little disc that came with it because I've backed up the few directories I want manually. I'm a manual reader, so I followed the instructions in it for the physical part of installing the drive in the enclosure. (Although I didn't have to--I've installed dozens of drives.) Mac Tiger OS recognised the drive, (a Seagate 250 GB), with no problem at all. When I recently upgraded to Mac Leopard, again the drive was recognised immediately and operates with no problem. It has been an inexpensive, attractive, well-performing, and well-packaged enclosure, which even came with a small Phillips screwdriver, which I didn't use. :)"
1,NO NTFS support by design,"The ""manual"" categorically states that this enclosure does not ssupport NTFS-formatted drives. Unfortunately, this makes the enclosure useless to me.I wonder whether the other people who couldn't get the enclosure to work also had NTFS drives."
3,Great until the ear padding comes off in black flakes,"Overall I have enjoyed the sound quality of these headphones, no real complaints there. And, they are comfortable.What has been disappointing me is the cheapness of the quality of the padding around the ears, and the fact that they are flaking off (see photos from users to see this) on my ears and head every time I wear them. No excuse for that kind of shoddy workmanship. I'd have been happy to pay an extra $25 for headphones that don't have this issue."
3,MEh,"The sound is very flat. i thought these headphones were for enhanced bass. Iwanted bass, these didn't supply.Pros:Very comfortable fit.11 foot long cableGreat for ""studio""stylishlight for its sizesingle sided cablesoft and comfortable paddingeverything is flat which might be good if you wantedCons:Very bulky11 foot long cable1/4 inch plugBass is not there, very flatnot recommended/ideal for portable playersIsn't very loud.Overall:If youre looking for STUDIO headphones, which give a true sound which is flat, this is the headphones for you. If youre looking for enhanced bass, look elsewhere.As studio headphones and listening to music, 5 stars. As headphones that is for enjoying music with great bass 2 stars."
3,Says Bass Enhanced but I didn't feel it,Returning this as I didn't find the bass to my liking. Also note that this comes with the fat headphone jack. You will need an adapter to connect with the computer.
4,One of the Best,"Although not the best Ma Vlast I`ve ever heard (that one is reserved for Levine/Vienna on DG), this one is consistently fine throughout.A splendid Moldau and Sarka, yet the Vysehrad was a little less so.Kudos to Kubelik for this one."
2,The sonic is NOT very good,"The sonic of this CD is flat, uninvolving and fuzzy. Personally, I think Decca often has better sound engineering than DG. Bought this CD based on review here, but very disappointed now."
4,Great marinade!,"I love the citrusy flavor of this marinade, and use it quite often. Sometimes I add it to stir fry to spice it up. As always Amazon's prices can't be beat."
3,"Nice game, but not finished","This game has a nice screen with a bright backlight. The pointer works great and is easy to use. The only drawback is that the score countdown takes a long time. 1000 pts = 1 minute. This means that if you win 4000+ points be prepared to wait 4 minutes for the winnings to be added to your score. Kids don't mind, but you will. The computer isn't very smart either, and doesn't bet when it has a good hand...Don't buy this for you, get it for the kids."
5,A gift for my husband,"My husband enjoys watching poker on TV, so I thought I'd get him his own game. He's so funny, he'll play it and get frustrated and say he'll never play it again, then before I know it, he's picking it up playing it again. I'm not into poker but he's sure enjoying it!"
1,Brand New Laptops are Cheaper,"Don't bother buying this laptop from Amazon. Visit Dell and buy a new one, that is faster, has more RAM, a larger HD, and better graphics for the same price or even less.The 75% off they are advertising is a joke. Its 75% off the original price from 3 years ago. The price they are offering here is about 75% more than what these laptops go for on eBay."
1,Why will anyone pay $600 for a Remanufactured PIII ?,Amazon lists this as 75% off the list price. What is this list price ?. Probably 10 years back ?. Now you can get a new PIV based one by paying little more (or a celeron for this price) with better configuration.
1,Good for basic activities...not so good for power users,"This laptop is good for teens / college students, as you can do most basic functions like taking notes in class or watching movies in the dorm. However, the battery time is minimal and it only has 256mb memory - pathetic for a laptop - very slow boot time, and only one or to activities can be run - not simultaneously...Lack of more memory makes it not so good buy for the price, as you can get a Gateway 512mb at $379"
1,Bogus - Better Deals on Dell.com,"At the time of writing, Dell was offering an Inspiron 1300 through their Small Business unit about $650 with the following specs:Pentium M 735 (1.7GHz/400MHz FSB), Windows XP Home, 14.1"" WXGA display, 512mb DDR2 SDRAM, 40GB HDD, CD-RW/DVD Combo, Wifi.Not an astounding machine by any stretch, but illustrative at exposing just how misleading, disingenuous, and paltry this ""75%"" deal is. For shame, Amazon -- this ad is *intended* to mislead people that may not be technically savvy, who would think they're getting a great deal. This is an hostile advertising/marketing tactic, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.To use this line of reasoning, you could advertise a 3"" color television for 90% off, and make it available for $75 -- because, as we all know, they cost over $1100 (inflation adjusted) in 1948.[...]"
3,High price,"This may be an antique by many standards, but for a person who doesn't have a lot of money (like me), this laptop will do.I am a student and I have a very good computor at home but needed something for on the go.Amazon is off there rocker for charging this much money for this model. I just bought the same exact thing at a bidding site. I got the laptop, working battery 3 swappable drives, power cord and case for under $300!,including the shipping.SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!!!!!"
1,"Amazon should be ashamed of themselves to offer this Used, Outdated piece of Garbage for more then a new laptop.","i agree with everyone else. this is a worthless out of date, Used, Remanufactured, antique piece of garbage. And Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for even puting the buy now words next to it. My dell laptop cost me around 500 and its brand new, has way more to offer then that.Amazon obviously thinks people are willing to pay that price for it and they obviously want you to pay that price because after all...their Advertizing it for that price....So they must be really crazy about trying to sell the trash because very obviously....TRYING TO SELL THIS ITEM MAKES AMAZON LOOK VERY BAD. This is a horrible antique, USED item...That everybody with at least half a brain in here agrees with the fact that it is Not worth what Amazon is asking !"
4,a wonderful book,"If you are interested in differentiation, and meeting the needs of individual students, then this book is for you. It focuses more than the other differentiation books by Carol on the affective component of the classroom. How do we meet students where they are and understand where they are coming from?This book emphasizes both teaching students and especially learning from them.Whether this matches your philosophy or challenges your ideas, you will find this book helps you in your teaching career. Carol is my adviser, and if you get the chance to see her speak, definitely do it. You should read The Differentiated Classroom for more about academic curriculum."
3,The book I bought.,I needed this book for a class. The book came in a timely fashion. I was not disappointed at all
2,Disappointing,"I realize that it's subjective, but the images in this book are not ""stunning"". Many are a jumble bag of doodles and diddling. Some are interesting. Hidden in the ""tennis plays"" there are some tips on Photoshop image making, but it's difficult to consider looking for them because of the dreariness of the imagery. This book presents the case for me that it may be best to check these kinds of books out more (e.g, reviewing the pages available at Amazon or actually handling in a bookstore)."
1,As a photographer it was..... disappointing,"Maybe graphic designers will like it but I did not find the images something I wanted look at. Made my head hurt. It is packed with a lot of filler: reasons the artist did what he did, what his favorite things are, and why this project was so so difficult for him."
3,Illustration Inspiration,"Photoshop tennis anyone? In Photoshop Secrets twenty designers face off in ten different matches, two designers to a match. One designer starts an image through a combination of photo clips and Photoshop actions then passes it to another designer for the next ""volley"". Each match has ten volleys and produces ten completely unique images. These are images that fit the digital illustration genre. If you're looking for photorealistic techniques, check out one of Bert Monroy's books. How much you'll learn about Photoshop techniques certainly depends on your current knowledge level, but based on what I found this book will give you a few interesting things to try and, even more, a good bit of inspiration if you're interested in doing some professional illustration."
2,Just another dumb Photoshop Book,Ok this book is just another bla Photoshop book. Nothing great not nothing new that has not already been mentioned in other photoshop books
4,only the best,"My wife and I are building a new hen house using re-claimed pallets.Some of the material was very old and brittle.Pulling the slats from the pallet frame without destroying them proved to be quite tricky.I bought the vaughan pry bar and it worked fantastic.Its sharp edges and thin profile sure did the trick.you can pull,pry or pound and it works great.With all the lumber I re-claimed from the pallets,the vaughan pry bar paid for itself in just one project.(Fresh eggs anyone?)"
2,Pretty Thin,I understand this is used as a reference for logo Design. The problem is that it is pretty thin when it comes to design books.Slick full color for most of the book..Not as helpful as I thought it was going to be.
2,The China Governess,"Dull, the plot never really went anywhere, despite lots of interesting bits. There IS a startling scene near the end when the killer is discovered in a dark cellar which is powerfully written but the rest left me cold I'm afraid."
3,play piano,"instruction goes too fast, and a little too advance for ""real"" beginners. i think it will be useful after getting other beginner lessons first."
5,Not just a ring...it's like wearing fine art on your finger!,"This is by far the best $165.00 I've ever spent on jewelry. At first I objected to the high shipping charge till I realized this ring was made in and imported from Canada. The ring is a perfect fit, and it is a dazzler! The photos don't lie... you get a stunning 10k gold and silver ring that only looks expensive. It is a finely crafted, beautiful & durable ring you'll be proud to own."
3,good cap,"it works the way a radiator cap is supposes to work, holds 13 lbs of pressure and then some. buy it"
4,Thank you Kate Kelly,"I'm not raising my own children, but sometimes I think I'm raising my grandchildren. I'm not surprised that this book won the 2003 National Parenting Publications Gold Award. It's a common sense, how-to approach to dealing with bad behavior. It's packed full of advice that works when you need to rethink your response to difficult situations. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a more effective way to hanle day-to-day parenting (or gandparenting)dilemas."
3,Surprized!!!!!!!!!!!,"I recently became interested in this item, after being showna zire 71...I was hooked, I purchased a zire 72s on 2/9/2006.I am new at this, where is the stylus,I been short changed..."
3,Would Be Wonderful If It Could Hold A Charge!!,"I would be utterly ecstatic with the Zire 72 if it would just hold some kind of charge. It needs to be charged every single day!!! Nowadays, with the millions of things that everyone is trying to keep up with, remembering to plug this in every night is a real problem.The features are wonderful and very useful. I love every single option on the Zire.It's just too bad they can't come out with an extended battery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS - This is my third PDA and both others held a charge for at least a week."
3,"PDA may be great, but palm cheapness shows","Even the special silver edition has black plastic stylus. One would expect a better, crome stylus like Tungsten handhelds. Also earbuds and expansion cards are sold seperately (then why advertise that it can play MP3's), I do not think it would add much cost to palm to make these standard. Comes with only 32 mb memory, which is not sufficient. Palm does not even include the screen protector sheets with Zire 72s. The blue version gives you ""Palm bucks"" which silver version does not."
5,GREAT TOOL!,"I love my Zire72! It is wonderful to have games, books, calendar, address book, music and note pad all in one! The freedom to be able to have all my information in a compact easy to use easy to carry place is well worth every penny. Easy Hotsinc makes it enjoyable to use."
3,Good product but......,Good Product but i had never understud the software. I sold it and purchase an IPAQ 2700 series with wifi. Windows CE. (another thing)....
1,A LEMON,"I bought a Palm Zire72 back in April, 2005 for $299.00 and it has proven to be money down the drain. I experienced the screen freezing up on me which required a hard reset procedure thereby resulting in a loss of all information. I sent it back for repair around August, 2005. They returned it, supposedly repaired, and I experienced the same problems with it after this first repair. Around May, 2006, it was sent back for another repair and I am again experiencing the same problem. The previous two ""repairs"" were done at no cost to me. The company now says that they will repair it at a cost to me because it is out of warranty. The company, notwithstanding the language of its warranty, should, in my opinion, stand behind its product. The product has proven to be unreliable and a headache. Be forewarned. I rated this product with one star because there was no lower alternative."
2,Terrible! Don't waste your money.,"I bought the Zire 72s as an upgrade to my previous black and white Palm that I had no problems with. It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again."
1,Watch out for the power jack,"I had my Zire 72 for 1 week and the little post inside the power input broke off in the adapter plug.I hope others can learn from me. Don't be nonchalant in plugging your unit in.DO IT CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY EACH TIME.I liked my old Palm pilot better. It was a Sony Clie SJ33. Even though it was only a Palm OS4, it was a workhorse that was well built and had it where it counted. I'd consider just going back to that."
4,"great, but still has cosmetic issues","I am in love with my new Zire 72 PDA... BUT... I bought the special edition because I read all the reviews about the paint rubbing off the regular, blue Zire 72. I have had my PDA for just over a week now, and already the painted lettering on the top ('palm one' and 'zire 72') has cracked and mostly rubbed off. It's not a big deal -- the unit is user friendly and works great, and it still looks nice, but I can't believe that this $300 item already looks worn when it is almost brand new and has been used carefully and moderately. Still a great choice, I think, but just a warning..."
2,Item misrepresented,"The problem was with the seller. The listing said it was a silver edition of the Zire, but it actually was the blue one. The problem is that I keep my Zire in my pants pocket at work and the blue version is a non-slick finish applied to the body of the Zire. It sticks to the pocket lining and I was specifically avoiding the listings for the blue version. Also, the seller included the wrong stylus and it's difficult to put in and take out of the groove. However, the Zire does work fine. When I contacted the seller, I received no reply about my complaint."
5,"If you don't own this yet, you are already missing out!",James P. Callahan is a rising star in evangelical academia (no longer an oxymoron). Pick up this value-priced book and gain a treasure.
2,awful,I found this a hard read. I had trouble believing Aimee couldinfiltrate Nic's operation in such a short time. For someone that didn't trust anyone - he sure fell for Aimee - who gave him no encouragement. I was totally turned off with the fact that if she truly loved Race as she claimed she could have stalled Nic's advances. That storyline was unnecessary -I wanted to throw the book across the room at that point. As it is it took me a week to finish the last chapters.
3,The Shoulder,"Overall an excellent resource for the orthopaedic shoulder surgeon. The basic science is sound and review of the literature is generally thorough. The glaring failure of this book is its coverage of arthroscopic topics (or lack thereof). Clearly arthroscopic shoulder surgery has been revolutionary to the advancement of our understanding and treatment of the shoulder and although the primary author still considers it the ""tool of the devil"", arthroscopy is now KING when it comes to the shoulder. Hopefully the next edition of this fine textbook will include material and video from some of the current experts in the field of shoulder arthroscopy."
2,Poems of Sadness,"Perched on Nothings Branch is a book consisting of many poems that seemed to touch the lives of both the author and translator. The poems consist of some hardships of life, the authors in particular, and his way of escaping from them. As you read the poems you sense a feeling of neglect and darkness as you notice that the boys mother doesn't attend to his needs. Later on his means of visions and dreams for an escape from life aren't good enough so he committs suicide. After finishing the poems I was left with a sad feeling."
3,A tormented man...,"I am a college student who read this book for a class. It was interesting for me to read these poems because of their dark nature. These poems kept my attention because this man was extremely strange. Not only was he in love with his own mother, but at point wanted to eat her!"
4,The Excellent Industrial Poet,"Peter, this was an excellent book of poems. Translating it was truly a gift. I loved the poets descrition and self imagery. You can easily see how the industrial growth of the time influenced the author's writings and lifestyle. Furthermore, the mother's death devistated his entire life and led him to committ suicide. By far may favorite poem is, ""Strength Song."" You can truely feel the author's self description of his almighty teenage power, which inevitably crumbles upon his mother's grave. The reader almost feels asthough he has fallen with the narrorator, on the rough grass of his mother's grave,with the complete loss his strength."
3,Perched on Nothing's Branch,I normally like romantic poetry. But this particular poem caught my attention. The poems are unusual but interesting at the same time. They all have different meanings to different people. I had to read a couple of them over twice before interpreting them myself. Overall I like the poems and it is a ggod book.
3,Perched on Nothing's Branch,The peoms in this book reflect many aspects of Attila Jozef's life. This book has a very apt title as is conveys the sorrow of the poet. His longing for his deceased mother is also very evident throughout many of his poems. The poet has a very descriptive use of words that successfully relate his emotions to the reader. This book serves a very interesting variety of poems.
4,To Put it Bluntly,"Sarcastic undertones,surreal imagery and social issues, the perfect recipe for poetry. Attila Jozsef utilizes his unique style along with his pesemistic look at the world to create his world. A world which the reader can take an inside look at the mind of this ingenious schitzophrenic.Growing up there was a lack of nurturing from his mother, in his poems he diplays his yearning for her love. It came to no surprise when this thirty-two year old committed suicide in front of a train. There was an evident fascination with trains throughout his poems. I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in poems, and even to those who don't. It is easy to read and comprehend."
3,Review on Perched,"Perched on Nothing's Branch is a sad life-story presented through a chronological list of poems. The author has serious problems which can be seen through his poems, and which are brought to us in a perfect translation in the English language by Peter Hargitai. This is defenetely a book that I would recommend to everyone. The book is filled with concepts to recreate anyone's mind, all the way from the oedipus complex to communism. Defenetely worth taking a look at."
4,death and reality,"The reality of life is sometimes hard to deal with. You love your mother. Can't understand how life can have such pain. There is only escape, only one way out death. I would recommend this book to anyone that has felt the pain of existence."
3,A new review,"Perched on nothings branch is an intrigueing accumulation of poems. The poem content covers problems in socitey, to the love one has for his mother. I recommend this book to any poetry lover or person who enjoys opening his mind to different ideas of life and the struggles in it."
3,Poetry an Escape from Reality,"Perched On Nothing's Branch is a good book about poetry based on the tragic life of the author. Attila Jozsef used poetry as a means of escape from his troubles and sad reality.The poems portray intensive feelings of depression, loneliness, sorrow, feelings of abandonment, unachieved dreams,disillusionment from life, feelings of worthlessness and every reason that made his life so unbearable. Jozsef was inspired by all his miseries to write his poems with passion and intensity. I believe the poems Jozsef wrote are great and allowed his mind and soul to be free."
3,A Page Turner in the Making,"Perched on Nothing's Branch is another one of Attila Jozsef's autobiographical masterpieces. The book gruesomely depicts Jozsef's obsession with his mother as a young boy up to adulthood. The realistic poems reveal an on-going troubled child's dreams, fascinations, and sudden death. You will live through the poet's life and become drawn to him and want to understand him more through his book of poems. If you are interested in poems that contain a combination of pantheism, nihilism, and Oedipus complex just take a look at Perched on Nothing's Branch, a good book for poetry lovers."
2,A Poet's Distressed Life,The book Perched on Nothing's Branch is a book of poems. A young boy is strangely obsessed with his mother. The young boy eventually kills himself because the people he loved were no longer there for him and he felt that there was no more meaning left in life. I felt that the story was a bit too dramatic. All the poems only discussed the poet's depressed life. That is all there was to the book. The translation at the end by Peter Hargitai was very helpful though.
3,A Book For Deep Thinkers,"Perched on Nothing's Branch can make one's mind go really wild. If you are a poetry buff, then this book's for you. If not, read it at a park, under a tree, on a Sunday afternoon. Jozsef is a man with problems. Pantheism, nihilism, and the Oedipus Complex is a dish that Jozsef is entangled in."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This is an excellent book in the series for Classical Guitar Method. I started with Volume 1 and moved onto this book after a year. I'm very pleased with the amount of material I've learned, and I still play some of the less complex etudes as warm up routines. I recommend buying the music WITH THE CD! Even though it costs a little more you can listen to the CD again and again (while driving, working out, etc) which makes it easier to learn. Move at your own pace and enjoy the combination of exercises and songs. Thank you Mel Bay!"
1,Special Two by NOW Foods - Vitamins,"The worth vitamins ever""-----""taste and smell horrible, big.I'd not buy or recommend it to anyone"
5,A Great Book for Carnegie Lovers!,"I've hardly gotten my nose out of this book since it arrived. Great photos, well written, some history of Hattie, and even price guides. Highly recommend!"
2,A work of art,"Until I read this book I had never collected any costume jewelry or even particularly liked it. I bought it because a friend wrote it. However, I have spent hours poring over the gorgeous color photographs and from now on will be alert for the Hattie Carnegie markings when I go to flea markets and antique shows. The book is not only a catalog of the more collectible Hattie Carnegie's pieces including estimated values, but also a well written entertaining biography of Hattie Carnegie. For a collector it must be a treasure."
5,Definitely buy this book,"First of all, I want to thank all of you who contributed reviews on this book. I purchased PSE2 a few months ago and struggled with the steep learning curve. I researched all the books I could find on PSE2 using amazon.com. The reviews convinced me to purchase this book. The books' size and weight immediately intimidated me. Once I installed the software, opened the book, and worked on the first lesson....it became very clear that the author did a fantastic job putting this together. The lessons are very easy to follow with clear instructions and screenshots of what the projects you work on in the lessons are suppose to look like. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has PSE2 or intends on obtaining a copy."
5,Outstanding!,For someone with my experience level (novice) this is a great choice. Dated but affordable!!
4,I could actually keep up!!,"I was searching for a low impact workout video and this popped up. Besides being a fan of Shirley Jones' singing, why not try an exercise routine.Shirley leads the beginners in low impact routines on one half of the room, while another lady leads the advanced people on the other side. The low-impact routines are easy to follow and you can do it at your own pace.The aerobic portion runs a quick 30 minutes, with an additional 10 minutes of simple things you can do at home during your everyday routines. This video is quick, easy, and is approved by the Medical Fitness Association."
3,Money for nothing and your curses for free,"A troubled book by an apparently troubled journalist. A truncated account of the world's most famous baseball team. The author relies on rehashed articles to create an unwanted myth. Under the 1st Amendment, censorship isn't allowed but the Red Sox Nation has other ideas and is watching."
1,"Curses, foiled again!","This book is cursed! You might try reading it backwards. Its deep blend of mysticism and historical revisionism made my eyeballs ache and blood flow out of my ears. I am not kidding about the literary curse, either. Since I read it, my hair has been falling out. I had nice curly hair, too. Beware!"
1,Pathetic,"When Sheffield goes 0 for 4 with 3 ks against Schillingnext year the CHB will still find fault with something.Generally, there is a bias in hometown sports reporters,that's to be expected. However, he has a NEGATIVE bias!This just so his tired read can still be shilled."
4,What Curse?,"First of all, let me make one thing perfectly clear; there is no curse. Dan Shaughnessy is a writer who wrote about an imaginary curse that, incidently, was conjured up by Red Sox fans. Had he the foresight to envision readers actually presuming that he was depicting a real live curse, I'm certain that he would have included a disclaimer at the beginning of his book.Why did the Red Sox enjoy success when Ruth was a member of that organization? It's very simple. Besides Ruth, the Red Sox also employed Hall of Fame pitcher Herb Pennock, and solid players such as Joe Dugan, Everett Scott, George Pipgras, Joe Bush and Sam Jones, among others. They were the team to beat at the time. When Harry Frazee sold Ruth to New York, it started a ""house cleaning"" that eventually sent the aforementioned players to the Yankees over the next two years. The Sox weren't cursed, they just became Yankees."
1,"Stupendulous, Johnson!","I cannot commence my expression of effervescent serendipity upon discovery of this oeuvre of virtuosity and verisimilitude. The meritorious originator of such a cynosure is surely a reservoir of percipience. For shame, those that would asperse the undubitable magnum opus of this maven. Dan Shaughnessy and his wondrous, overlooked achievement is a lagnappe; a gift from the gods! Disregard Warren, Nemerov, Brodsky or Pinsky, for the emergence of a wordsmith in the class of Virgil manifests once in an era. Shaughnessy is that wordsmith. His time is now, and we are all equally blessed to bear witness to it."
1,Nonsense. A complete waste of time.,"It's not only the lack of factual research that makes this book a wasted read...The book is based on a fairy tale, that the author has presented as a reason for the Red Sox' misfortunes of the past 80+ years. It is completely illegitimate.Red Sox fans have Dan Shaughnessy to thank for getting the ""Bambino"" curse into the national media spotlight. He has (unwittingly?) become the number one enemy & annoyance to the Red Sox and their fans. Until The Sox win the series, they will be taunted by moronic tv announcers that treat this as an noteworthy story, and nit wit opposing team fans that hold up pictures of Babe Ruth, to try and taunt the Red Sox.There was a recent documentary on HBO on this subject, with the author trying to sell this book. After hearing him speak on the subject, I cannot even consider him a journalist.Thanks Dan, looking forward to your biography on the Easter Bunny."
1,Waste of time,"If you want a good history of the Red Sox, please see Red Sox Century. It is a well written account of the entire history of the Red Sox. In the Curse of the Bambino, you will find a poorly written book that is neither humorous nor entertaining. The book perpetuates the myth of curse through mistruths and distortions of fact. If you truly are interested in the occult, I'm sure there are better selections to choose from than this book."
1,Garbage,"Factually incorrect (Shaugnessy did a disgraceful research job), and massively overhyped. Sox fans should look for Bill Lees entertaining ""The Wrong Stuff"" or *any* other book out there."
2,"Oversights, oversights, oversights","How can a book claiming to outline the early history of the Boston Red Sox fail to mention the special, intimate relationship between Herman Ruth and Harry Frazee? Shaughnessy fails to even mention the great love between these two people - one a young man raised by priests, the other a broadway financier. The author completely ruins his credibility by not telling the complete tale, whatever his motivations.I strongly suspect latent homosexuality is to blame.Boo!"
4,"Every time I read this book, I learn something new.","Curse of the Bambino remains one of the most provocative novels ever penned by a Boston author. I just read the book for the seventh time, and I'm still amazed by Shaugnessy's skill in weaving a shocking tale of incest and sexual harassment against the backdrop of Red Sox baseball. Even after having read the book multiple times, I'm still taken aback by the scene in which C.H. Boyf (the sportswriter/protagonist) visciously belittles the Bambino's mentally retarded nephew, Jeff Stone, in a sick attempt to get the young boy to go to bed with him. I'm still confused, though, about the Bambino's reaction to the abuse of his nephew. Instead getting revenge on C.H. Boyf, he lashes out at all of Boston -- putting a curse on the city that results in Boyf's hateful, illogical columns becoming a mainstay in the city's leading newspaper. That's some curse."
1,Given the perspective that only time brings...,This book can still be considered nothing more than garbage. The same is true for its author...
1,Silly man / Silly book,"A Boston sportswriter with an agenda creates a fictional ""curse"" to explain 80 years of frustration since the Red Sox last won it all in 1918. Information is contrived to fit said agenda.Simply put, there are better ways to spend money if you want to revisit Red Sox history."
1,4 Star ? Hardly,"Is there anything more evil in the world than a cynic who isn't funny?Thanks to Dan's book I cannot watch a national telecast of the Boston Red Sox without some mention of ""The Curse of the Bambino"" before the third inning. The odd thing is the ""curse"" is rarely if ever credited to Shaughnessy as if in some way the ""curse"" has been stalking this organization since the twenties. To people outside Boston you'd think the ""curse"" was as much a part of the city's history as tea parties and Albert DeSalvo.Sox fans can be fatalistic bunch but rarely do they find themselves on the floor after a late inning loss shaking their fist against the specter of a fat Baltimore slugger, although finding them on the floor is not uncommon. Credit Dan Shaughnessy to milk that pessimism for a few bucks.If one is truly interested in Sox history, purchase Red Sox Century by Glenn Stout and Richard Johnson."
1,A history of failure?,"The Curse of the Bambino is a compendium of failure - hardly suitable fare for a real fan of the Boston Red Sox. Sox fans all know what happened in 1946, 1967, 1986, etc.The author castigates Red Sox Nation for being Calvinist in its pessimism, yet he contributes to this pessimism by publishing a chronolgy of Red Sox disasters. In essence, he's creating the aura of which he is critical.Buy ""100 years of Red Sox History"" on DVD. A real history of the Red Sox without the manufactured nonsense."
1,"Find another gravy train, Danny Boy",One of the best things about the Sox winning the World Series is putting an end to this guy's garbage.
1,Outdated Tripe,"Leaving aside the bitter simulacrum of a human being that the author reveals himself to be in his newspaper columns, it would be a mistake to purchase this book on other grounds. Potential buyers should beware that what is represented in this book as a factual framework has been shredded to pieces by Red Sox Century. The writing itself is a series of transparent setups for a play on words that you can always see coming a half page off. Finally, the author has the gall to criticize Red Sox Nation for, he claims, being endlessly pessimistic while at the same time being the single greatest promoter of such an attitude! Way to have your self-fulfilling prophecy cake and eat it, too."
1,Poor book,"Poorly written book.It's rambling and hard to follow at times, you have to kind of guess what the author is saying at times in order to makes heads or tails of what he is supposedly trying to say.The reason for this is the basis of this book is at best fabricated. Nowhere does it articulate the premise of the book. In essense, the book is a bunc of loose and unrelated ideas trying to support and clearly flawed theory.If you're buying this as a gift, I suggest ""Red Sox Century"" instead of this."
2,It's Outdated Now,"As of October 21, 2004 this book is officially outdated and no longer relevant. Whatever one thought of the concept of the ""Curse"" previously (and there was precious little substance or merit to it, anyway, as readers of ""Red Sox Century"" already know) it died when the Sox defeated the Yankees in Game Seven at Yankee Stadium. RIP....or something like that.The Yankees now have the greatest collapse in history on their record. Not the Red Sox. The ""Curse"" doesn't live here anymore, if it ever did at all.Maybe Dan can next write ""The Curse of Tino Martinez"" or ""The Curse of Vince Doria"" or something but this subject, at least in Red Sox Nation, is now officially dead."
4,pretty good,This is one of those books that at times you wanna put it down and cry because of the memories!! It is a good book with detailes of Red Sox failures and how they relate to the Babe
3,Economical but crude,"Received this cane cutter and it is not bad for the price. The handle is two slabs of wood riveted to the sides the blade which leaves a space all around the handle. On my cutter the wood handle slabs were not even, one was higher than the other. I had to sand the handle slabs even to get a comfortable grip. There are 3 rivets in the handle not 5 as stated in the description. I ended up filling the space between the handle slabs with wood filler and then sanded and coated with poly varnish. Very comfortable handle now. Looking at other brands they all seem to be the same type of construction perhaps, some are made with more care."
4,Good for brush knife,"I grew up where sugar was the main crop and these knives. So when I found it, I bought one. This knife seems to weigh a bit more than I'm used to. So it'll tire you a bit more. But the added weight will help make for shorter work.One of those cat ones came through a few weeks ago and did a number on our strand of bamboo. 1-1 1/2"" thick bamboo. I tried this and a machete. This knife did better. I think it was the added weight of the blade.A good knife for brush and yard work."
3,Good product...,But worth the money only if you are going to be doing a LOT of logos....and who does that? Fun to play with if you have nothing else to do.
4,Slide storage boxes,"Overall they do the job as advertised. The latch mechanism ""ears"" are just a bit too long and scrape the desktop - not good."
5,great book,"A great book to prepare your toddler for preschool. Nice illustrations and a great story of a boy elephant, Daniel, and his first day at school.What was amazing is the fact that children can associate with Daniel, given the fact that the author does a fantastic job portraying all things, emotions, activities that preschoolers are facing every day at school. All my kids loved the book as even the sequence of activities described in the book matched what they were doing at school! A definitely must-read before your little one goes to preschool for the first time."
5,Louis Jordan - He Made The Blues JUMP!!![.],"Fantastic set of CDs. Louis Jordan will keep you bopping all day long. Chock full of songs that explore the humorous failings of the human character. These discs had everyone at work humming and hopping.Highlights include:""I'll Never Be Free"" - Ella Fitzgerald""Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens""""Saturday Night Fish Fry""""I'll Be Glad When You're Dead (You Rascal You) - With Louis Armstrong""What's the Use of Getting Sober""""Knock Me A Kiss""BUY THESE DISCS NOW!!![.]"
5,A grea tsampling of Louis Jordan's music at a BUDGET price,"This box set is amazing it is more or less the complete Decca material(actually less), completists will want the Classics Complete and chrono series, however at this cheap price you get a sampling of his almost complete Decca stuff! This is the place to start when discovering the joyous music of Louis Jordan. JSP also has exelelnt complete Louis Armstrong Hot 5's & 7's, and an exellent Django Reinhardt box set. This is truly an amazing set!!!"
4,"Lloyd Brown St Louis, MO","Wolf Shadow, great review. Louis Jordan was my uncle and I have almost all of these great cuts on original 33 1/3s and even 45s and 78s. I will buy this CD to preserve my Louis collection which I hardly ever played in the past 40 years.I give it four stars instead of five because his grearest blues hit ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out"" is not included in over 130 cuts.There are others I would have liked to have seen included like 'School Days', which we loved as kids years ago. Plus more of his blues solos. Lots of people did not consider my uncle a ""serious"" musician, which he surely was.All in all, a great box set well worth the price."
4,John Coltrane Recommended it,I'll be straight up about this - John Coltrane cited this group as one of his favourites and I bought it on that recommendation. The restoration is excellent by JSP; it's a bargain at the price; and the music is terrific for the car or walkman. Fun stuff.
5,perfect,This DVD is an amazing instructional video that explain a lot of grooves and ideas for the modern drummer!!
4,Still one of the best...,"I saw the Who for the first time in 1967, and saw them several times after. Once Keith Moon died, I felt they were over... but this CD serves as a reminder of how great they once were, and how truly good they still are. Is this as good as ""Live at Leeds""? Nope - but then again, I'm not sure ANY live recording is! If you're a Who fan, you want this CD, if for no other reason than to hear some relatively rarely heard pieces, as well as Pete's superb guitar work. If you've never really listened to live Who, start with Live at Leeds; but for those who bash the sound quality of this, I contend that you've been listening to too many modern lip-synced pre-recorded ""live"" albums....The Who ARE the real deal, and this CD sounds awfully good to this fan's rock&roll ears."
4,The Who's Last?,"There is no band like the Who. Never has been. Never will be. The Royal Albert Hall Show includes some of the last live recorded performances of this Hall of Fame band with John Entwhistle on bass and for that alone it is a worthy buy.Other Who Live efforts have more notoriety -- Live at Leeds for example -- but the live recordings of the past decade have a significantly better sound quality and a fuller, more complete sound.Pete Townshend shows in these concerts that he continues to be the engine that drives The Who. His guitar work is his alone, whether it be acoustic or electric. Roger Daltry is not at his best voice here, yet his efforts are still worth noting. Join Together might be a better example of Daltry while Townshend shines in both.Guest shots by Eddie Vedder and Bryan Adams are included in the recording but, honestly, I'd rather just hear The Who play The Who."
4,Real solid and Crisp,"It's True Everything The Who dose has been repackaged over and over again witch is why Even though I do LOVE the who And Think they are the best rock and roll band after the beatles I never bothered to check out""Live at the royal albert hall"" Until I saw it on VH1 awile ago And I was like DAMM! In my opinion this is the best sounding album in along time! I say It.even sounds better Than Who's last And definatly everything that came after that. There are alot of inspired song's with help from guest artist I highly recomend it!"
2,Save your money and get the DVD version instead.,"I had high hopes for this CD (and the SACD version that was released). With the exception of some of the ""special guests"" that really shouldn't be there, and were clearly there only for the ""face time"" and to serve their egos (Learn the dang lyrics, Bryan Adams! Pete corrected you at LEAST twice during rehearsal!), this was a really good performance that was wonderfully recorded. Unfortunately, the mix is pretty messed up on both versions, and makes the band sound pretty bad. This may not be noticeable to a casual listener, but anyone who is familiar with the DVD version of this same show will know what I'm saying. The DVD sounds so much better. Why that mix wasn't used for the audio releases, I'll never understand!The only redeeming value here is the bonus disc, which contains songs not on the DVD. However, the bonus disc alone isn't worth the cost of this release.With luck, maybe it'll be reissued someday with good sound, but I wouldn't bet on it."
5,Bonus Disc has part of Entwistle's last Who show!!!,"The first two discs are great, but the same as the DVD (except Mary-Ann, by my count).The third disc is the reason for buying this CD set. It includes four songs from Entwistle's last show with The Who."
2,Why !?,"For a veteran band such as The Who to release such a bad live album is incomprehensible. The sound quality is terrible. They sound like they were practicing in someones garage and have not played together in years. Roger's voice sounds awful, Pete's is not much better. If this is what the future of The Who is they need to hang it up. I gave it a 2 for song selection, the only good thing about the CD."
1,Never received the CD so it is difficult to review it,This CD was never received and attempts to obtain tracking information from the carrier were never received either.....Oh but somehow there was no problem in receiving the bill for this CD. Amazing how that works huh?
4,What I got out of this book is that really anything goes...,"I won't begin to write as if I know what law school admissions committees are looking for in an essay. I believe it is common sense that not all schools will review or value the personal statement equally. As a current law school applicant going this alone I bought this book to help give me a clue as to what the PS is all about and I feel the book did that. What it showed me is that you can write whatever you want to write about - just make it meaningful and insightful into WHO you are. I struggled with the format of my essay and after about the 6th revision of the format (nevermind the content :) I came up with a format I would not have even considered before reading the book. As mentioned previously, I am a CURRENT applicant and do not know as of this writing how successful my essay is, but I DO know that I am proud of what I wrote, and feel very comfortable with it - because it is absolutely 'me'. Good luck to us..."
3,"Good, but not the best","This book has some good advice, and the essays are interesting to sample, but this book is definitely past its prime. I regret that I bought it. ""Essays That Will Get You Into Law School"" by Kaufman, Dowhan, and Burnham was much more helpful to me when I wrote my personal essay for my law school application."
1,Completely out of date,This book is completely out of date - but perhaps may oil the creative gears - no modern essay question addressed - the content on Essayedge.com is free & far better.. Another Ivy League lawyer doing things besides practicing law .. you gotta love it ..
4,Famous,Great movie of life in the 70s traveling with a rock and roll band. Some great music and a cute story line with a charming ending. Makes one what to be young once again and on the road.
4,Awesome movie - Explanation below,"I thought that Almost Famous was a terrific movie; probably one of the best films of the year. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and over but never get bored of. I give it four stars not because the film itself was lacking anything, but because I just felt the DVD could have had a little more on it like a director's commentary. Cameron Crowe is one of the best filmmakers of the decade and he certainly succeeded in making Almost Famous great."
2,Almost famous is a great movie,"This ""BOOTLEG CUT"" DESTROYS THE MOVIE, EDITORS EDIT FOR A REASON THE ADDED SCENES RUIN THE MOVIE, AS IF HITTING THE BRAKES ON A STORY AND MAKES THE FILM EXTREMELY CHEESY, AND FILLS IN ALL THE BLANKS THAT YOUR IMAGINATION,FILLED GLORIOUSLY......it spoon feeds the plot to you"
2,bad but original,"A tedious film, but I give it two stars instead of one since films are usually about beautiful people and the subtext of this film was: the pain of ugly people. That's original. But it was a dull film; and I'm a fan of that rock era, and I still couldn't wait for it to end."
1,extended version blows,"Don't get me wrong. I think Almost Famous is a 5 star movie. But the extended version kills the whole film! Its only a handful of added scenes that were cut from the American version, but they were cut for obvious reasons. I bought this import & within the same week I sold it for one third of the price just to get it off of my shelf! Now if this bluray offered both versions, it would be a must have. But it gives you no choice so save your money."
2,'Almost Famous' (Should be titled 'Almost Almost Famous'),"You've got to be kidding! Were Kate & Frances really nominated for Academy Awards for this boring movie? My husband and I both fell asleep several times and we tried to watch it twice! Don't bother. I can't believe Mr. Ebert gave this movie any credence whatsoever. Ms.McDormand's character was different, but she was like most of my friends!"
3,Not so great...,"I was disappointed in ""Almost Famous""; I was expecting more from this movie. The story centers around a teenager traveling with a rock band, during the early 1970s, while fulfilling journalistic duties. In the meantime, he starts to have feelings for one of the groupees that has been traveling with them. The previews made this movie look much better than it actually was."
2,Almost over-hyped.,"Almost Famous by director Cameron Crow is just mediocre and completely blown out of proprotion. Critics stated this was the best movie of all-time, I was very disappointed when I rented this movie. It was nothing like I thought it would be, yes Kate Hudson is glorious and mesmerizing as ""band-aide"" Penny Lane but the writing was boring and the other characters were so one-dimensional it was ridiculous! Crow hasn't directed or written great movies in the last decade, his best film is Say Anything, not Jerry Maguire or Vanilla Sky. The music is rockin' but Almost Famous had me singing another tune. Skip it."
1,Another DVD release???,"This review pertains to the Almost Famous Untitled - The Bootleg Cut (Director's Edition) which is another example of studio executives taking advantage of loyal customers by coming out with yet ANOTHER DVD version to suck the very last penny out of those same fans who made the film successful to begin with! I am so tired of this marketing strategy bs! ONE STAR! Don't buy it! Wait till the ""Almost Famous - Expanded Edition"" or the ""Almost Famous - Criterion Edition"" or the ""Almost Famous - Platinum Edition containing a commentary with Cameron Crowe's sister-in-law!"""
2,Almost Entertaining...,"The only character even remotely interesting was ""Lester Bangs"". This movie was an overfluffed self-indulgent ego trip, no one could be such a perfect child/adolescent as Cameron Crowe was supposed to be. The movie was 100% predictable and contrived. The story line was an assault on my intelligence, and the characters were totally uninspiring. Maybe this stuff seemed more interesting to everyone in 70's when they were stoned, I remember these types of people as directionless buffoons (I was ~10 at the time the movie took place). And now I am certain that with this kind of sentimental crap, the birth of Punk Rock was an inevitability. The movie did have excellent: acting, cinematography and costumes/sets, however I get really irritated when a movie is used as someones self-glorifying ego-trip. Unless you are were a teenager or a 20-something in the 70's you will probably hate this."
3,More features,There is actually a lot of back story to this movie and I was hopping they would be on the DVD but no.
2,"OK Movie, Kate Hudson totally overrated","The movie, basically a coming-of-age-story (for all parties involved), was so conventional it was rendered totally inoffensive (except for the painful Elton John singalong...) and palatable.The real reason for those two stars is Kate Hudson's ""performance."" She did little but sparkle her eyes and look slightly devious, but somehow this was enough to enchant the drooling hordes into believing she actually put any work or thought into her performance. She owes a great debt to Crowe (who is a master at creating likeable, yet shallow characters who play off all the obvious archetypes)."
4,"Great, but...","I am looking forward to the director's cut edition that is coming out soon which is featuring 30 minutes of scenes cut from the theatrical version. I wanted more and I just felt with this version while very good and the actors deserving of the praise and accolades rendered I felt like there were some moments that were cut short. For example, the scene of Penny Lane dancing in the theatre actually lasts about five minutes and much of it was cut from the theatrical release. There are some other scenes as well that were cut and an additional scene from the end. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars. If you are unfamiliar with this film, watch it. It is a feel-good film no doubt, but well-written with expertly drawn characters."
2,Almost worth watching,"What an over hyped disappointment.I was really looking forward to seeing this,but is not in the same league as Crowe's other movies.Crowe normally has good actors in his films,but in this one,well,all I can say to Patrick Fugit is don't give up your day job.His was probably the worst performance by a leading man in recent memory and ultimately lets the film down,and as for the overrated Kate Hudson,an oscar nod for staring into space half the time,it seemed to me that she was just reciting lines from a script and not acting at all.Thank God for Frances McDormand for giving it a touch of class. Overall,I felt emotionally detached from this movie,which is strange for a Cameron Crowe film,but his self-indulgence here is to blame,and I also couldn't help thinking that""This is Spinal Tap"" is the final word in rock movies,so do yourself a favour and watch that instead."
2,"""Amost"" is the best than can be said.","My title says it all. If you don't see it, trust me, you won't regret it."
2,More mellodrama than 8th grade camp,"While the kid who plays William is good, the rest of the characters invoke apathy at best. Kate Hudson's character is especially pointless, I never cared one iota about ""Penny Lane"". I spent most of this overly-long movie simply waiting for it to end.The only standout performance was from Jason Lee who was the lead singer of the fictitious band Stillwater. The soundtrack is also excellent, although you've probably heard all the songs included about 100 times to often."
2,Almost Half-Decent,"I can't say that this movie is terrible, but I really don't get how everyone is so enamored by it. It was extremely boring, it didn't go anywhere, and it seemed to drag on and on. It really suffers from the same problem that ""Jerry Maguire"" had: it doesn't know if it's supposed to be comedy or a love story, and it falls completely flat. The bus scene was embarrassing to watch."
3,"Mediocre, at best","William Miller, played by Jason Lee Patrick Fugit, finds himself at a crossroads in his life when he is given an opportunity of writing a piece for the ""Rolling Stone Magazine."" William, a fifteen year old kid, has never felt like he fits in with the rest of the crowd. He's smaller, smarter and just doesn't get what it takes to blend in with his peers. This is a movie loosely based on director Cameron Crowe's life. It is about a teenage boy who wants to become a reporter for the Rolling Stone, so he joins the tour of Stillwater, an up and coming rock band. He deals with rejection as well as acceptance, and he even ends up falling in love. Perhaps not worthy of the hype and vast praise that it has garnered, it is certainly an enjoyable film that does what it does well."
3,Ho-hum,"This movie does not have the lasting impact of other Crowe films: Singles, Jerry Miguire or Say Anything (all of which rank among my favorite films). If it weren't for Jason Lee (who does and outstanding job given his under developed character) I would have given it a 2.The story is based around a young boy with a gift for writting, he teams up with a band grows up a bit along the way. Unlike the other crowe films, I couldn't find any enjoyable characters (save Jason Lee). The predictable story-line just doesn't offer any moments that come close to ""You complete me"", and the ending will leave you unsatisified.The actors are good, but I believe a few were cast for the wrong parts.Rent before you buy."
2,Almost Fell Asleep,Time now for my review of Almost Famous. While the ex-hippies might be enjoying this boring movie if you're looking for a fun movie to watch you might try something else. What's ridiculous about this is that the critics gave the movie a good review and I watched it because of that. But the movie is a lot of feel-good nonsense in the tradition of the 70's. Just goes to show you that you have to make up your own mind on these things.-----------------------------------------------------------------
2,Extremely Overrated,"As a writer myself, I saw this movie looking forward to a film i heard was really great and deserving of every award it was nominated for. Needless to say,I was quite disappointed. What's the big deal with Kate Hudson? She had a few good lines, but all she did was prance around and smile. The young man who played Crowe should've had the movie all to himself, because he did a fine job, and followed through with his dialogue, sincerity of the character, and the innocence that was showing in his face as became quickly involved in such a corrupt, whirlwind environment. It was sweet of Penny Lane to give the Stillwater leader Crowe's address. But that was such a cheap ending."
3,"It's pretty good, well worth seeing, BUT THAT'S IT!","What the hell are all these people going on and on about?I won't recap the specs for AF except to add that's it's the most OVERRATED movie I have seen in recent memory.I'm not a teenager either, I'm a 70's kid, so I totally get the references in the movie.It's not a bad movie by any means, but it's not an ""all time classic"" either.It's worth your time because Crowe is a good storyteller, just ignore the silly hype from the VH-1 crowd or you're be disappointed.Overblown hype kills anything eventually."
5,Saving Rock & Roll,"Somewhere in the movie, this line is utters: ""You don't have a choice when it comes to music... true music finds you."" Gems like this only come from the pen of Cameron Crowe and while this is the type of movie that everyone will love, you'll feel the passion if you're in on the same music fan wavelength that Crowe is.There are several touching scenes; Crowe takes some soulful rock & roll tunes and sets them to scenes that he always knew deserves to be played out to. It's like when you play a song, you have a picture of a scene, a setting, a situation that it plays to, and Crowe makes that come to life."
5,Perfect!,"Sometimes you get dissapointed. The ""Special Edition"", the ""Deleted Scenes"", the ""Director Cut"" doesn't add nothing into the mix. Instead, they substract some cash for nothing.This is not the case.The 35 or so additional minutes of footage contained in the ""Untitled"" version are absolutely fabulous. Every single additional scene fits perfectly into the original movie, adding more substance, explaining something, or simply providing more information you finally thank for. The only question it raises is ""why this version didn't get into the theaters?"".The second DVD (""Almost Famous"") is an excellent movie by itself. Go and enjoy it. And give some thought on your professional life.Plus, the CD with six songs by Stillwater (one of them, ""Fever Dog"" was part of the Soundtrack CD, the other five are new releases in the format) are excellent songs briefly performed in the movie."
5,Best Movie of 2000,"I believe there is a certain age group that can completely identify with this movie. I must say that I rarely go to the movies alone but was profoundly glad that I went to this one solo. It allowed me to really feel the movie. When the first cords of ""That's The Way"" started I found myself uncontrollably weeping. There were so many touching moments I can't name them all here. It brought me back to a place I usually only visit in my memories until seeing this movie. It was a sweeter time, a simpler time, when music meant everything. Much like the main characters. Thanks to Cameron Crowe for a wonderful journey back. And much thanks to Nancy Wilson for a perfectly planned out soundtrack. I recommend this to anyone 30-40 yrs. of age who needs a good shot of the 70's again. Enjoy."
2,Product misrepresented.,"Very disappointed. The product I received was not the special edition as advertised. It only contains the one disk of the movie, but according to the ad, there should have been another special edition disk, as well as a music cd. Since I have already opened the product, it cannot be returned. If you're only wanting the movie, this package is fine. But don't expect to get any more than that."
4,fun,A fun movie and light hearted break from reality. Good music included throughout the flick and puts you in a better mood than before you turned it on.
5,"My personal review for the Movie ""ALMOST FAMOUS""","""ALMOST FAMOUS"" Is a totally awesome and entertaining movie.Loved it from the first time I saw it :) FIVE STARS across the board!!!!! Haven't enjoyed a movie this much since viewing ""AUGUST RUSH"""
4,Almost Famous,"If you are looking for a movie that is comprised of comedy, drama, and good music, then I would highly recommend Almost Famous. This Academy award-winning flick will make you laugh, cry, and sing along with the characters and you might even learn a thing or two about the 70's. In terms of the plot, Almost Famous is anything but predictable and the various obstacles that William, the main character, must overcome and the challenges the other characters face, will keep you in your seat. Although I, being born in the late 80's, never had the opportunity to live in the 1970's, Almost Famous enabled me to learn various aspects of the lifestyles and culture of rock n' roll's hottest time period in American. Everything from the rocking music, clothing trends, and the care-free attitude in this movie will bring you back to a more exciting time in history and can make anyone wish they were on tour with a 70's rock band. All in all, Almost Famous is a great movie."
1,Drag!,I do not understand all the hype with this movie. This was one of least entertaining movies I have ever seen. People who liked this movie have nothing better to do than watch paint dry.
1,"almost worthless... oh, wait... I mean totally worthless","The only possibly interesting relationship in this movie is the boy journalist's relationship with the editor of Creem, who acts as a mentor to him. But this gets about 30 seconds of screen time. For the rest of the time, you get to hear the protagonist getting nagged by his cliche mother who urges him at regular intervals, ""Don't do drugs!"" You also get to hear him getting the runaround while on tour with the Abe Smellman Group - a band with no appeal, no talent, no existence. The highlight of this band's creativity is when the lead guitarist drops acid and announces, ""I am a golden god!"" The movie is more or less This is Spinal Tap, with a fifteen year old journalist thrown in... oh yes, and a sixteen year old groupie who bangs all the rockers. That's wholesome, isn't it? Well, its supposed to be. You are not supposed to come walking outta the theater wondering why these guys aren't getting sent up for statutory rape."
1,a strange movie,"Characters in it are delirious, at least for me (I am not addicted to the 70's); some of them even do not seem human (or humane), but I can probably understand why in the particular contxet of this movie.. You can find an excellent summary of the movie in the bonus tracks (DVD version), especially the first track which which shows the main characters all assembled to listen to Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to HEAVEN""."
2,Rehash,"I was actually excited when I saw the previews for this movie. The problem with this movie isn't the story. It's the screen play (cookie cutter formula for people who didn't live through the 1970's), the script (unbelievably predictable), the acting (marginal at best, but not horrible) and the music (similar to a bad Led Zeppelin). If you end up liking this movie you might want to see ""Detroit Rock City""."
4,Great Film,"This is a great film for teenagers to adults. I also recomend Bless the Child, The Kid and especially What Lies Beneath and Coyote Ugly."
2,You tell me...,I just don't get it. This movie was MAYBE good. People treat Crowe like he is the Second Coming after this flick.
1,Almost the worst movie I've ever seen,"Even though I love rock music, and I thought the soundtrack to this movie was excellent, and I thought the acting was admirable, the storyline in Almost Famous is ludicrous and boring. This was an opportunity to make a great, or at least fun, movie about the music and larger than life characters from 1970s rock and roll. Instead, it's a flop. The movie gives us an excellent soundtrack, but we learn nothing about the artists who made that music. It presents us with some interesting characters, but they are not portrayed in any depth. There is some potential in the storyline -- a 15 year old away from home for the first time touring with a rock band -- but the story we are given is boring mishmash about flunkie groupies and shallow, moronic rock stars.How anyone could have watched this movie and liked it is a complete mystery to me."
2,Almost a total loser,"This was really a dull film with not much to engage the viewer. I mean, the subtext was original in a way: the pain of being ugly. And that may be why it's dull. When you see a movie you kind of want to spend a couple hours with beautiful people. Dull, dull, dull."
2,Almost Entertaining...,"The biggest letdown of a movie I have seen in a while. The lead character (ie Cameron Crowe as a boy) is way to perfect to be believeable. The movie was shallow and boring. The only character remotely interesting was ""Lester Bangs"". Somehow, I remeber the 70's as being distinctly different."
2,ROCK AND ROLL REVIEW,"This is one of those movies you've heard so much about and are thoroughly disappointed by. ""Almost Famous"" is almost Gidget in it's simple pansy story about Rolling Stone Magazine's cub reporter Cameron Crowe in the early '70s. The music isn't even relevant of it's day but are even older radio hits. This kid really began to ware on me. I kept wating for something, anything to happen."
1,Terrible Quality,The quality of the video stream was terrible! I have 30 mps service and have no problems with any other streaming service. Last time I will purchase video from Amazon.
2,movie skips,"the cover of my movie was not in the best condition. that didnt bother me so much. the thing that irriates me is that it skips. i only buy items that are in excellent or good condition, and i wouldnt justify skipping as excellent or good condition"
2,Silly and shallow,"I had heard how great this movie was, but was sorely disappointed. I think a great movie could be made about the rock scene in the 60s and 70s, but this isn't it. I found the characters too stereotypical and the situations absurd. Surely, we weren't that shallow and silly at that time."
5,Best 70s Rock Movie Ever!,"Anyone who gives Almost Famous less than 5 stars simply doesn't get it! Not only is this the best film to be released in the year 2000, it is the best movie about the rock scene of the early 1970s that I have ever seen - period.Although I was only about five years old when this story takes place, I'm fairly well read on the history of rock music. I have to admit that I caught absolutely zero historical inaccuracys during the course of the film. Cameron Crowe knows his stuff.The film is well executed in every area - Direction, Writing, Casting, Acting, Cinematography, Editing, Soundtrack, et al. I've never felt more satisfied after shelling out eight bucks to see a film than I did after seeing A.F....and who cares that we have to wait a while for the ""special edition director's cut"" DVD. I already bought the current edition and I look forward to buying the director's cut as well.Nuff Said - this film is a timeless classic and deserves all of the praise it's been getting."
4,Almost Famous is Almost GREAT,"There are two reasons why I didn't give this movie 5 stars.One) Phillip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best actors on screen today and I wished he would've been in it more. He's brilliantTwo) I loved Jerry Maguire (Cameron Crowe's other big hit) and it was not only because of the characters, but because it dealt around football. This one has Awesome characters, but deals around 70's rock music--which I know not much about nor do I like the musicBUT it was an awesome CHARACTER film. Kate Hudson was outstanding and so was the kid---I don't know his name. Frances McDormand (Fargo) is also at her best in this film. I loved seeing Jason Lee in something other than a NEW JERSEY film, too.If you love 70's rock music then disregard the 4 stars and give it 5!"
5,Band Aids Not Groupies,"Great story with an awesome cast of characters. Frances McDormand plays the great mom character trying to keep her kids safe and sound while one runs off to be a stewardess to get away from her, the other winds up on the road with a band writing an article for Rolling Stone magazine. The magazine editors have never met him and don't realize he's only a teenager. The band winds up denying the story he's written at first but then tells Rolling Stone that it was all true. But the real story is in the journey of the band, the boy, his mother, his sister and of the ""band aids""."
4,"THE PERFECT MOVIE RENTAL, BUT NOT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY","Here is another movie that I was not eager to see but was glad that I had the chance. This story is truly about Sex, Drugs and Rock-&-Roll. It is NOT a family movie though. Being a product of the 80s, I think I was more able to appreciate the subtleties of the story better. Certainly my Mother & Father wouldn't understand it quite as well.What I liked best about the movie is the ending. That is where all the parts come together. That is where we, the audience, really get the opportunity to ""know"" the characters for who and what they are.I don't own this movie and don't really plan on buying it. But I am certainly glad to have seen it..once."
5,Excellent Film!,"I first saw this film on an airplane ride. At first glance I knew this would be interesting so I watched intently. Since the plane ride I must have watched the film more than 50 times and that is not an exageration. Every 15 year old boy would want to tour with a rock and roll group and this rivetting performance brought together with the music of stillwater, led zeppelin, and elton john is a sure win. This should have won best picture at the oscars!"
4,NO DTS ON THE BOOTLEG CUT!!!!,"What's THIS about?! I bought the stripped version a long time ago when it came out and absolutley loved it. I'm an huge DTS fan, okay....and naturally, loving this movie I HAD to have the bootleg cut...so I bought it this week only to find out the bootleg disc doesnt have a DTS track on it! What (...)is THAT about? The theatrical version does but this one doesnt???I would have rated it 5 stars but gotta take one off due to technical stupidity. C'mon Crowe, you release a movie the way you wanted it to be seen and then cheap out on us with the audio options? Bad move if you ask me...."
3,a dissenting note,"A lite weight ""coming-of-age"" tale; 70's rock as seen through Kate Hudson's rose-tainted shades. There were a few good bits and performers, but overall, the characters were romaticized: the earnest striver, the bad-girl-with-a-heart-of-gold, the tarnished knight who comes through in the end. The camera work is TV-average. As for the soundtrack--how can a film be about the liberating power of rock and make an Elton ballad its centerpiece? For rock in all its jaded glory?--try Scorseses the Last Waltz."
3,"believable, likeable characters","The acting is the best part of this movie. Everything about Billy Crudup's performance is right on target. His expressions, movements and speaking are just right. His character comes across as likeable and very believable. Frances McDormand, as usual, is exceptional. Patrick Fugit, Kate Hudson are also real and refreshing. There just isn't any bad acting in this movie.I didn't think the movie itself was all that memorable but the acting was so good, it made the movie quite enjoyable."
4,"Brilliant movie, but no director commentary","Almost Famous is a brilliant movie that tells the story of the rise (and implied fall) of the fictional 70s band Stillwater. Crowe has said that Stillwater was inspired by the Eagles and he perfectly captures the heady 70s rock scene. The cast is uniformly excellent, but Frances McDormand as the mother and Kate Hudson as Penny Lane are especially good. The movie is sentimental whithout being too sticky and several scenes are instant classic. In particular, I love the bus scene where the actors all sing Tiny Dancer. Unfortunately, as good as this movie is, it lacks a director commentary from Cameron Crowe. Worse yet, he subsequently released the ""bootleg"" version...that does include his commentary. What a gyp!"
5,A Favorite movie of Mine,"This movie was very entertaining. It grabs your attention at the beginning and doesn't let go. My favorite scenes were William's mother's talk on the phone with Russell (""You can still make yourself into a person of substance,"" ""Yes, ma'am.""), the scene in the bus where the cast sings Elton John's ""Tiny Dancer"", and the end. Kate Hudson is a very beautiful and amazingly gifted actress, and I hope to see Patrick Fugit in some more movies after this. Very inspiring film."
3,"...(Great movie, disappointing DVD)","Don't get me wrong; I love this movie. I thought it was the best film of 2000. ... The cut seems identical to what I saw in the theater, and there are no deleted scenes included. The only important extras are a music video, a behind-the-scenes making-of special, and Crowe's original RS articles. Also, this is a 1.85:1 transer, not a 2.35:1 transfer as some sources claim. So there you go."
5,fantastic!,"Great sound track, fits the movie perfect. I find it very easy to lose myself as the story unfolds. Highly recommend"
4,very entertaining,"When I heard about this film, I really didn't think it would work. Was I wrong! This is a fun movie to watch, the dynamics between the characters is excellent, I loved the scene in the airplane near the end, and I think it captured the spirit of the times."
5,Simply a great movie,"Some reviewers describe Almost Famous as a ""comedy"". I don't understand why anyone would say this. AF has its laughs but this is NO COMEDY. Almost Famous is a masterfully written and acted film. It, in some strange way, reminded me of that old TV show ""The Wonder Years"". An innocent kid growing up fast on the road with a 70's rock band. This film is full of life, emotion and great music from the 60's and 70's.Kate Hudson has got to be the most amazing woman on the planet. Just one look in to this girls big blue eyes makes me melt every time I see her. WOW, what a beautifully talented soul Kate Hudson is. And newcomer Patrick Fuget is one heck of a actor in his own right. He is something special. Every actor in this film gets an A+ from me.One of the best films I have seen in years. And a great DVD with lots of options. Get it now!!!"
4,One of my favorites from 2000,Almost Famous is a great movie even if you don't like rock & roll. Patrick Fugit as William is great in his first role as are seasoned verterans like Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson. The direction by Crowe is very good and he is very well informed about the music. I'm proud to have this movie in my DVD collection and I say that as a BLACK MALE.
2,Almost Famous? Try Almost a Cure for Rampant Insomnia!,"This movie was pretty boring. I thought the best scene was during the near plane crash. Jimmy Fallon did a good turn as the supporting character. I could have cared less what happened to the main character as he was way too removed and bit of a [weakling].Kate Hudson's ""star making perfomance"" seemed to mainly consist of traipsing around with a knowingly annoying smirk. There were some good bits but they were far and few between. Viewers would be better served by viewing any number of documentaries about the Stones or the Who."
2,"Dull, drawn out and long.....","Snoozarama. I was very disappointed; it did not live up to the hype. It was eerily similar to ""Rock Star"", which in itself was very disappointing. The characters were dull and predictable; the film had zero energy and no fire. And what was with the scene where Kate Hudson danced alone on the gym(?) floor for 30 seconds? What on earth did that mean? Don't waste your time and $$$ on this one; ""Almost Famous"" is ""Absolutely Awful""."
2,Melodramatic Schmaltz,"Good if you're into lightweight fluff. I'm not. I've seen worse. It (more accurately, Kate Hudson, damn!) kept my interest to the end, but way too campy for my taste."
5,BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"if you have not seen this movie....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Don't just rent this movie, BUY IT! ALMOST FAMOUS has it all! Comdey, drama, romance. As well as GREAT MUSIC! Almost famous takes you back to the 70's, a better time if you ask me. I am not going to write about the plot of this movie, just how great it is and how it has inspired me. I have owned a guiter for a couple years now. After seeing this movie I have finally picked it up and learned (learning) how to play. What can I say about Russell Crowe?? but he is a PURE GENUS! This movie is actually about his life story! WOW! I could watch this movie everyday and NEVER get tired of it. So, if you are checking out the reviews to see if you want to watch it.. the answer is YES!"
2,Was Rock & Roll really this boring?,"Cameron Crowe's affectionate autobiography will make anyone who grew up in the 70's feel a tug at their heartstrings as they remember their first Rock Concert. Beyond that this movie never really goes beyond its feel good veneer settling for contrived situations, cliches and familiar manufactured endings - except for its cant miss soundtrack, Cameron's good times dont quite translate to film."
1,if zero stars were a choice.......,"Without a doubt,by far the most overated,waste of time film I have ever seen....endless cliche, endless characters you couldn't possibly care less about, and the added insult to injury of it being 2 hours long.... See Spinal Tap instead.....superior in every conceivable way.... I wish I could have gotten comfortable enough to go to sleep through this, since dreaming would have been far more entertaining....."
5,Fantastic Purchase,"While I was hesitant to purchase it since I only have my US PS3 Slim to play Blu Ray on, I ma really happy that I did. This will work on any American player and the clarity is remarkable. Not to mention, the cast from Phillip Seymour Hoffmann as the music critic Lester Bangs to Kate Hudson in her Oscar nominated role as Penny Lane knock their performances out of the park. I'm extremely happy that I picked this up while I had the chance!"
5,"Perfect, perfect movie.","Almost Famous is definitely on my top 5. I just love everything about it. Buy the DVD, buy the soundtrack, and prepare to enjoy it over and over again. Without this movie, Kate Hudson would be completely unredeemable. She shows that she has completely inherited her mother's unexplainable charisma, although I haven't seen it since in the average romantic comedies she's done since. And Patrick Fugit? Perfect. I can't imagine anyone else in that part."
4,"""I'm on drugs!!!""","4.5 stars. While the script is the actual star of the film, the cast is exceptional as an ensemble and every actor here is worth mentioning at least once. But it's the word-play and the situations that these fine actors find themselves in that propells the film forward. The script is so sharp, in fact, that many times during the movie I felt some of the actors had a hard time keeping up. Don't take that as a negative criticism because screenplays are rarely this well-written with such a huge cast as its centerpiece. It just doesn't come together all the time. I should not forget to mention the outstanding soundtrack, which I'm sure was hand-picked by Cameron Crowe. He is notorious for his films having fantastic soundtracks. ""Singles,"" for instance. I have watched this movie many times and I always laugh and get carried away with the interesting lives of those on tour. This movie has great acting, an exceptional script, and another great soundtrack. This is a journey worth taking."
5,DVD Perfection!!,"This movie, along with ""High Fidelity,"" is good to show to anyone who might wonder why music is the central focus of your life! Most people my age (33) stopped listening to and following music when they left high school, but this movie is genius in showing why music still matters and will always matter for myself. The scene where his sister is leaving home to the strains of S & G's ""America"" is a priceless example of the power songs can have. On this extended DVD, the extra footage enhances an already excellent movie, the Stillwater CD is a sweet touch, and the bonus features, including the commentary, add substantially to the mix. This is one of those DVD's to get lost in for a weekend, a trip back in time to when music really MATTERED, before videos and celebrity stole the soul. Don't worry about the higher pricetag here; every dollar is worth it!!"
4,ALMOST PERFECT,"The character development of this film is flawless. Crowe guides us through the plot with humor, sentiment, and nostalgia. We know these people. Hell, I knew a lot of these people in high school. The performances ARE perfect, and I was quite disappointed at it's lack of Oscar nominations. This, in my opinion, was the best film of the year. So why only 4 stars? Well, there's a sequence at the end that just annoyed me. Upon finally getting his exclusive interview, William asks his first question... and the movie should have ended. But Crowe chose to do a series of cuts that were jumbled and out of sequence. It really was a series of some bad choices. I don't know what effect he was trying to achieve, it was lost on me. Maybe someone else has an interpretation. At any rate, it was a second-class ending to a first-rate movie. The last minute aside, this movie is a classic, one that I will watch many times for years to come."
4,A wonderful album,"I bought this item on a whim and am so glad I did. This album is full of great messages and wonderful music. James has created songs that speak to the human heart while not ignoring those electronic beats that get you on the dance floor. There is a great video for his song ""Rise Above"" which is a must see. Besides ""Rise Above"", I recommend ""I Believe"" very highly especially for those who wonder where Mr. or Ms. Right is."
5,Captivating and realistic,"Not a romanticized story with a plot of medieval politics, monks or kings. The reader never even learns the year of the story because the peasant woman from whose perspective the tale is told isn't aware of such things. Even life outside the confines of the 30-person village is unknown and therefore completely feared. Life was cold, tiring, perilous, and stinky. After reading this book, you'll gain great insight into what real life was like, but you'll never wish you lived then. A tough book to put down. The worst part is that it is so short, would that it were another 100- or 200-pages."
3,Not Deserving of the Criticism,"I'm fed up with the armchair critics that are picking at this book for dates, historical correctness, etc. It's pretty common knowledge that Brits weren't big on baths in old times. Besides, when you're freezing your buns off, who cares about a bath? This book is a story about the life of a poor woman and the hardships faced in very old times - do you really care about the exact date? Women should make a point of reading this. Since we didn't exactly have rights for thousands of years, it is such an eye opener to read about such hardship of extreme poverty, protecting children from illness, the horror of gangrene - not even identified back then. The cooking, without our modern devices, and laundry in a creek are enough to horrify me. Lighten up and enjoy a good story. It is a little short but the point is made."
2,Quality,"I was very enthusiastic about watching this DVD until I put it in the DVD player. It was ALL glitches and I could not watch the DVD.I looked at the condition of the DVD and it seemed fine. I even cleaned it, and put it back in the [DVD]player but it was the same thing...Glitches.I thought that it was my DVD player, so I changed the DVD and replaced it with another movie. The new movie that I substituted, played well. No problems. So The Third Jihad is a faulty DVD. At least the one I received is faulty. Wish the sellers of these products would check the condition of it before it is shipped to the customer"
3,technologically flawed,"This was looking like a very interesting film and really enjoyable with great interviews until the copy I had stopped playing. I was very disappointed that I could see the whole film. I highly recommend the film makers to improve their quality control. Take note: I get better quality pirated films in Asia. So if the Asians can do it on a home computer why can't you do it on your big machines, eh? Too damn lazy?"
1,Another Smorgasbord of Islamophobia,"Just when you think the neocon smearheads have maxed out their profits on scaring people about ordinary Muslims, along comes another dispicable rambling. Dr. Jasser should be ashamed of himself for lending his name to this piece of garbage.Note that it is important to decontextualize everything that Muslims do in the world to try and prove that if they are violent, they are following Islam and if they aren't, they aren't good Muslims. I should mention that the litmus test of loyalty to Israel would be failed by the Red Cross, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the UN. Those interested in learning about Islamic terrorism would be better served by reading about American involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan."
5,Very clever DVD,"If you liked this DVD read the bookThe Third Choice: Islam, dhimmitude and freedomby Mark Durie. They compliment each other beautifully."
5,Great educational tool for Americans who car about America,"If someone is interested in the truth and not just the politically correct BS governments feed their citizens then this along with ""What the West Needs to Know about Islam"" and the ""Obsession"" are probably the best DVD's to start with. The downside is once you learn the truth and start looking into how we fight Islamic fundamentalism you will find out the FBI, CIA, and other groups our tax dollars fund don't have enough common sense to stay away from Muslim translators, how stupid is that. When I see that others such as Jewish arabic speaking individuals are turned away I just want to throw up. I think another good step after learning from this video is for people to go online and research where gas/oil companies buy their oil and refuse to buy gas from companies that buy Arab oil."
4,A New Take on the Civil Rights Era,"I read this book for a grad class about the 1960s. The book was informative about the Civil Rights movement in Philadelphia. Most people think of the South when this era is discussed, but Countryman sheds new light on protests in the urban Philadelphia area. The general criticisms we discussed in class (about this book) were that some of his statistical data seemed slightly (and probably unintentionally) skewed to support his thesis. Also, Countryman makes a point of the important roles women played, yet relegates most women to a smaller chapter mostly involving poverty activism and welfare rights. This was my biggest criticism, if he didn't have enough information on women's involvement, he should have left out that statement about their importance. But having made the claim, Countryman didn't back it up with anything more than a few short examples."
2,Did they field-check?,"I bought this book to see if there were any local waterfalls I didn't know about. I was a little shocked at the description for Chamber Creek Falls. It is described reasonably graded trail that continues to Chambers Peak. In reality it is a steep trail (18% grade). The trail most definately does not continue to the (trail-less) Chambers Peak.The description for the beautiful Coal Canyon Falls gives a GPS coordinate that will lead you right across the private land it asks you not to cross.It appears the authors made a lot of phone calls and are quite personable, but didn't to the field work to verify all the information they were given."
1,wrong product,"The packaging, liner notes, cover and cd topside all say Toots and the Maytals ""Funky Kingston/In the Dark,"" but the music recorded onto the cd is an indie band called Arcade Fire ... or something. Not Toots. Beware!"
3,Nothing new.,"Most of the music on this CD is on Toots's old albulms, which I have. So am sorry I waisted the money."
4,classic roots reggae album...,A must for anyone delving deeper into rock steady and roots reggae. The fact is that the jamaican roots music revelution went a lot deeper than Bob Marley. This is a good one to give you another point of view on howoppressive the government is and the underlying love of their country that jamaicans embody. PEACE
4,"Value for Money, Sounds very clean","I give this 4 stars because I'm comparing it to my powered studio monitors which I probably should not be doing :)These speakers sound quite balanced over their range and they start taper off around 80 Hz at the low end however, I'm able to use these for movie watching in my home theater without a subwoofer. They handle the lows pretty well. Mids and highs are extremely clear. I've heard them at a friend's place paired with A PSW-10 Subwoofer from Polk and that combination is pretty good.They are going on clearance as I write this review, but are still worth it if you can buy them anywhere. You should not have to pay more than $170 for pair. A number of stores like Frys have excellent deals on these speakers."
2,Not impressed,"I am not impressed with this product for several reasons. Number one: it's advertised as an all-day wear, which it is not. Number two: its also advertised as suitable for working out- it wont clog your pores, etc, it is no better than a drugstore brand on this front or the all-day wear. And lastly, finding a tone that matches your own is nearly impossible as it only comes in three shades. Keep your money."
5,Classic Electro Funk,"Recommended for fans of 80's Electro Funk/Hip Hop. These are lesser known tracks by Afrika Bambaataa, away from his MCs the Soul Sonic Force. ""World Destruction"" is the track he made with Jon Lydon...a crazy apocalyptic Rock meets Rap banger. ""Shango Message"" and ""Zulu Groove"" are heavy Electro Funk meets Hip Hop. Sort of updated Funkadelic with more synths. Bernard Laswell produced them in a project called Shango. They are an acquired taste, but if you have that taste, you will love them."
5,Works very well!,Easy hook up to an older style opener. No interference issues.Remote attaches easily to the inside of the car.
1,"It's exactly what it says, for dreaming.",This put me to sleep. the first song is a good one though. by the time you hit song #3 you will be put to sleep.
5,Makes me feel smarter!,"I am desk jockey who does electrical design work. I have little in-the-field electrical experience. I use the NEC codes frequently to make sure what I design is code-compliant. I have a copy of the standard 1999 NEC book and found many parts of it difficult to interpret. This new ""handbook"" version has answered all of the questions and uncertainties I had about the code. It has an illustration and explanation for just about every question I could think of. Even when I don't need a certain thing, I have found myself leafing through the book just to learn more.I would recommend this to anyone, but especially engineer types or those who are inexperienced. I feel much more confident about my job and I don't have to ask electricans those questions that make you feel stupid anymore. Even master electricians will appreciate the explanations of code changes from the 1999 version. Overall, I can't recommend this book more, well worth the $50 or so more than the standard NEC book."
1,Beware!,"I hope that this DVD edition might solve a problem that haunts every single presentation of this movie: it is pitched almost a 4th above of the original opera pitch!Even for listeners with no perfect pitch, the experience of G. Reich voice sounding like a tenor would be a frustrating one!"
2,"A poorly written, inaccurate text","This book sells well because of the simulator CD which impresses beginners and highschool level students. Anyone with CNC machining experience and know-how will come away disappointed.CNC Workshop illustrates dozens of factual errors in programming format, it contains some glaring omissions, and spends far too much space promoting its own flawed software. This software has crashed and frozen up in many of my students' computers and fails to accurately portray CNC motion.This is an adequate book for very basic level CNC knowledge or for people with only elementary knowledge of the English language. It does an acceptable job of explaining some basic NC concepts and the multimedia package (NOT the simulator) is fairly helpful for educators. It would be a fine book for $35 in a highschool shop class, but does not deserve to share shelf space with books by Smid, Lynch, Valentino, Krar, or Curran."
3,ehhh,"the book is a good start. It won't make you a machinist. The software is out of date. Like 1999. Won't work on windows 7. If you have to get it for a class, guess you have no choice. Price isn't too bad."
2,"Good book, worthless software","The book is an update to the previous edition. Unfortunately, everything you needed to know can be found in the original version for less $$. The software is buggy. The Java code is ""write once, run maybe"" and will not install on anything but certain versions/builds of Windows and internet explorer. Great book for learning G-codes, but buy the first edition at a discount."
2,Software issues,"I could not get the simulators from the CD to run. I have the most recent associated software updates and a well-maintained virus-free newer computer. I saw a disclaimer somewhere while struggling with trying to get the simulator to run that it may not operate correctly with more current versions of bla-bla software, so I'm not sure. Anyway, if the software that comes with this book can't be made user-friendly enough to run with a minimum of hassle, then it's not much good to me. Yes, I will try to get one of my computer expert buddies to assist, but should I really have to do that after paying good money for this book/CD??"
2,Disappointing,"If you are a complete dummy in camping and never spent a night outdoor, this book may be for you.The information is too basic (don't put your tents near garbage containers for instance...) and if you have already been camping, even without being an expert, this book will bore you very quickly. Without talking of the numerous pictures of the author's family..."
1,Poor quality and service,"My Panasonic over-the-range microwave only lasted 1.5 years before it died on me. Panasonic wanted me to uninstall it, bring it to them and pay too much to have it repaired. It wasn't nearly as good as my GE over-the-range microwave which lasted more than 10 years!"
1,damaged kit chain,this day i received the kit and reviewing I found broken the connecting link. I am disappointed with the product.I need buy the connecting link. Please tell me what is the correct reference for the connecting link?.
2,A bit too preachy,"The part about 70 minutes in of the kid talking then coughing was hysterical! Otherwise, there's some decent laughs in this movie but it's very preachy and obvious with it's message. I went in not realizing it was a documentary however after I did, I was still very let down by the way this was done."
5,This is one of the most beautiful CD I have ever lisent to!!,This CD is a MUST for any collector of Vivaldi's music
4,Vivaldi-lute,"The recording was sharp and clear. The soloist was bettter than the orchestra, which still was very good.The addage about Vivaldi's compositions applies. This disc is the best bargan I've had."
2,no melodies,"there's nothing very memorable about this band. there are no choruses or bridges--just aimless drones of minimal beauty. i saw them live and was bored out of my mind. i love the bands they reference (read: rip off): mbv, ride, slowdive. these guys need to listen to the beatles and the stones on occasion and learn how to write not soundscapes but songs. bands you may not know, but should check out if you have heard that the dreaded strats are your cuppa: boo radleys, black watch, mogwai, chapterhouse, for against. all of whom add something to the genre--unlike ""love and distortion."""
1,Extremely disappointing,"For all the hype, this band should've delivered something far more original, or at least memorable... The snotty wannabe Brit-pop vocals really annoy me, especially cuz this band's from SF. The music is completely derivative of the early/mid 90s Brit scene, from Oasis to My Bloody Valentine and everything in between.I was expecting spacey guitar jams based on ""critical media"" reviews, but instead all I got was two or three chord songs covered with delay. ""Distortion?"" I don't think so; this is pretty weak compared to Fugazi, or any other heavy band you'd care to mention.There are so many other bands that do this better and, uh, about ten to fifteen years earlier (or more, check out Love), that it's not really worth it to hear this fake-Britster whine and moan at you like a dying cow."
3,Stratford 4's shoegaze revival,"'Love And Distortion' falls somewhere in between the feedback blasts of My Bloody Valentine/Ride and the dreamy drug-induced vibes of early Spiritualized. Along with Nick McCabe guitar whines of The Verve is a sludgey Pavement-type sound lurking between the cracks, yet without straying too far away from the shoegaze template. The closest comparison to these echoing riffs meets white-noise can be found in The Pale Saints or Springhouse. Nevertheless, the trip continues to be atmospheric, trippy, with the listener barely hovering off the ground."
2,Bugs among the notes!,"This is an easy to use program, but watch out for the bugs. The most serious problem is that if you save a score as a MIDI file, all the repeat & end signs that you may have put in the score disappear. There is another peculiar problem with the program: if you cut & paste notes, chords or dynamic signs too often, they either stop playing or keep playing at places on the score where you removed them from. The ""manual"" tells you to keep clicking on a little brush symbol to redraw the score, but that doesn't always solve the problem. One annoying feature of the program is that every time you play your score, the note palette closes. So, if you want to add a few notes, listen to the score & then add a few more notes, you have to keep opening the note palette. After a while this becomes tedious.I suggest you spend your money on something better.Frustrated Musician"
1,No manual!,"I haven't been able to use it because the manual is garbage. I contacted them, with no reply. It is a waste of money if you can't figure out how to use it!"
2,Not happy with this software,"Granted, I didn't pay a lot for this software, but I have found it very, very time-consuming to use. It is next to impossible to undo a mistake. In fact, if you make a mistake, you often have to simply delete your entire work and start over. Very poor software documentation as well. Wish it was better...but, I'm going back to just using blank staff paper!"
1,Junk ... Trash,Poor documentation. Clumsy to use on some of the finer points of music notation. I've lost file after file during the middle of notating music due to buggy programming corrupting the file while trying to fix musical mistakes. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm going elsewhere and will pay for a more sophisticated program this time.
1,smell is sickeningly sweet,"I bought this on another site and feel compelled to review it on amazon as well. I got it for my toddler's curly hair. The smell of this product is sickeningly sweet. It's very talcy, which I don't understand because it contains no talc. Also, why would you want a natural product to smell like baby powder, which is not natural and not healthy? Even though I hated the smell out of the bottle I tried it once just to see. It was not all that effective and the smell just really grossed me out. If you are easy to please when it comes to fragrance you might like it. But if you are a minimalist on scent, try to find it locally and get a sniff of it yourself before buying!!!"
2,Almost as helpful as the care manual that comes with the car,"I needed to track down an electrical problem in my Grandmother's Camry. Obviously this is limited to the electrical system and therefore I cannot be sure my experience is reflective of the entire book. However, my experience was that the care manual that comes with the car had just as much detail on the components locations and how to check and remove them as this books had. The only difference was a slightly more wordy approach in this book. Following the advice of another reviewer I called Toyota and ordered the official wiring book for this car and I was amazed at how much easier life became.Don't waste money on this book!"
5,Great!,"This is a great book for all level DJs. From the basics of beatmatching to more subjective topics such as how to read a crowd, the authors explain everything with a very direct and enthusiastic language. A great buy!"
5,Great book!,"I'm very happy about reading this book. Now I know a lot more: what is important and what not, which equipment buy and which not. It's the best book you can read to be a great dj."
4,Just Average,"I found this book to be mediocre at best in terms of providing useful information. I was looking for a book that went into detail about DJ gear and how to setup, etc. They really don't provide alot of information about that in this book, so I suggest DJ for Dummies for beginners instead."
4,Nice book for new starters,This is a very nice book to read for casual music lovers who like to learn DJ how to. Right price for the contents.
5,I wish I had this book when I started...,"I've been mixing for more than two years now, and I wish I had this book when I started. I've also saved myself countless more years of future experience, just by reading these pages. I recomend it to anybody who wants to be a DJ. I also STRONGLY recommend anybody who wants to be a DJ to buy the Intellect DVD (search for it on Amazon). Happy mixing! :-D"
4,An excellent look into the art of dj'ing!,"This book is a very insightful look into the world of the old and modern dj. His/her art, techniques, and some basic tips are covered in it. This is the DJ bible, and i greatly reccommend this to any stuggling DJ. Have fun with it!"
5,Beautiful and Elegant Design,"Appropriate for desk, living room and bedroom in my house. The movement is silent, no distracting ticking. The face of the clock is easy to read. The crystal cuts by Waterford are exquisite in their reflection of light."
4,Good tutoring in plain English,I bought the whole beginner-intermediate-advanced volumes 1-2-3 and found the course to be very helpful. I dont have a set of Nunchaku at the moment but they are in the post as my set got lost as things happened that stopped me from training but ill enjoy learning at my own pace and getting back into the swing of things. The double Nunchaku training looks straight forward!.Thanks for publishingMichael
3,Better than nothing,As several other reviewers have mentioned this is not the highest quality jig on the market.However if you don't have the need to have a dedicated drill press and have the time and skill to tinker with fitting a drill to this one you can produce acceptable (but not excellent) results with this stand.I have successfully used this drill stand to produce custom plugs for wood working projects as well as on a few light metal projects. The quality was not the best but it was better than if I had attempted to use the bits by hand.
4,Mixed Blessing,"The new songs don't keep up with the older selections, for the most part. The older selections are a good mix of the pop songs and the alternative music songs. One of the older songs is done with an orchestra -- which smothers out the singer's voice, unfortunately. It's okay to skip around on, but difficult to listen straight through."
3,Some good information,"This book has some good information. Not sure what one of the other reviewers was talking about but this book does not have any pictures. It is printed on paperback novel paper even though it is hard cover. The information is there, but I wouldn't necessarily say I agree with all of the authors opinions. For example he states the wrapper is responsible for 80% of the cigars taste. This is obviously an opinion and thats fine. I would say the wrapper may be 30-40% of the taste. I have read many cigar books over the years and I enjoyed reading this book, but if you are looking for a quality book printed on smooth paper with some colorful pictures this isn't the book. Hope this helps your choice because it is hard buying a book online when you can't flip through the pages."
3,A very helpful book for cigar smokers,"I have read many books about cigars. This one I liked much not only for the nice pictures but also for the plain language, that helps even the most inexperienced to comprehend with the cigars and their differences. Although the writer doesn't seem to know everything about the cigars, the point remains that is a easy-to-read cigar guide for the non-experienced."
4,Track Listing,"1. White Christmas2. Santa Claus Is Coming Town3. Blue Christmas4. What Are You Doing New Years Eve5. Winter Wonderland6. Jingle Bells7. Oh Holy Night8. O Little Town Of Bethlehem9. The First Noel10. It Came Upon A M1dnight Clear11. 0 Come All Ye Faithful12. Hark The Herald Angels Sing13. Silent Night14. Auld Lang Syne15. I Believe16. You'll Never Walk AloneThe CD is a typical rendition of popular Chirstmas songs. Her voice isn't as powerful as it traditionally sounds. If you're a Patti fan, then get it. I also uploaded the original cover as released in the US."
4,"Several significant typos, but still rewarding","I've completed 26 books of this type (Acrostic, Acrostix, Crostic, Crostix ...), and in the others, typos were rare and insignificant -- they were in the clues. This book has several instances of mislabeled letters, a few cases where ""(two words)"" was missing, and one case where ""(two words)"" was on a one-word answer but missing from a nearby two-word answer. I was still able to solve the puzzles, however, and I enjoyed them."
3,"Part Hit Piece, Part Chronicle","If you are an umpire, regardless of level, you will find portions of this book interesting. The author's literary style is wordy (the book could be half as long without losing any substance) but his overuse of adjectives is easily ignored by the reader. It is a fast read and a book you can put down and pick back up at will. Despite some obvious errors (""One hundred and fifty miles south of San Diego, in Bakersfield, California,""), the author introduces you to the people part of umpires about whom you had, largely, only known their names. What could have been an intimate book about umpires and their unique view of baseball is, instead, an uneven account of the 1974 National League season for one crew of umpires. Part hit piece, part historical chronicle of members of our society rarely written about, the book will hold your interest if you both love baseball and are an umpire. Absent being both and you may not see it to the end."
5,Ancient Egyptians put it all together.,"Most people don't think of ancient Egypt, when the subject of metaphysics comes up. This book covers all the basics, and pulls it all together."
1,Egyptian Cosmology: The Absolute Harmony,"It is bunch of baloney. I undestand it is possible to interprete Egyptian culture and spirituality not only from the standpoint of professional Egyptologists. Without doubt one can wirite about Egyptian deities (netroo) and rituals e.g. from the point of view of Hermeticist. But author's theses about four fundamental physical forces, about physical cosmology etc. are shocking and unheard-of. Ths way of thinking goes astray."
3,Blaze of glory.,"Blaze rocks! Another great metal band lost overseas. Bailey shows that there's more to him than Iron Maiden. The reason he didn't win over Maiden fans was because he wasn't Bruce Dickinson. On his own, Bailey and his gang shine with agressive, fist pounding anthems, with the underlying theme of man vs. machine. I have my doubts to how live this CD gets. If you're unfamiliar with Blaze, this disc will deliver all you need to know."
5,gardening a bit less but enjoying it more,"After ll years living in zone 5, we retired back to zone 8 in 1989, and started to plant a lot of camellias. We became Camellia Judges and Master Gardeners. In 1996 we were asked to put this house and garden on tour. We live on a working farm of 168 acres. Again we worked very hard to get everything in shape, including working our son and daughter-in-law very hard. All our visitors were very kind and we really could take credit for the plantings. this time. Every quarter I write an essay for our Gulf Coast Camellian magazine and have mentioned several garden writers I admire. Since all but one have died, I am asked how to acquire the books and always send them to Amazon. It is so easy to order and I don't have to get dressed and go to a book shop that won't have what I want, anyway. We live ten miles from a very small and lovely town but the nearest bookstores of any size are an hour's drive away so I depend on Amazon."
4,Very Good,"A sexy ..and I do mean sexy doctor, Samantha is a psychologist assigned to the murder case of the so-called 'hillside strangler'. She comes upon Kenneth Bianca who is at first accused of these crimes but needs to be assessed in order to further tie him to the murders.At first convinced of his innocence Samatha sets out to do more test on Ken.Along with this assignment Samantha finds joy is drugs and sex ( she's gorgeous). As the murders come close to home she decides to up the stakes and hynotized Kenneth to see which of his multiple personalities -if any- could have committed these horrible crimes.Dealing with a psychotic mind which masks high intelligence, she must pull out all the stops to get this killer at his own game.This movie was surprisingly Good.I recommend this."
3,worth watching,"A friend rented this movie for me. I saw Joe Dirt w/ Brittany Daniels and thought she was great. Half way through watching the rental of this movie I was online ordering it. If for no other reason, it's worth watching to see her. HOT."
2,A silly police drama,"The story is so unrealistic that its off putting. A serial killer is loose. So the police call in a psychologist to examine the suspect. From the start, I thought something wrong as she is certainly not dressed like a professional person doing this sort of work. More like a sexy woman going to a party. In the process of trying to get close to the alleged killer, we find out she is quite a free spirit with plenty of sex and drugs with several people one who she does not know. With AIDS now days, you really think a doctor would know better. Towards the end, she hypnotized the alleged killer and finds out that he is lying. Unfortunately for me, I have been hypnotized several times and I did not find this scene particularly convincing. So I did not enjoy what was probably suppose to be the highlight.The acting, I thought was okay. Nothing special."
5,"Feng Shui: For Body, Mind and Soul","What more can you say about a women who can not only write best selling books, but also put out amazing cds. There is too much to say and just not enough time. Her newest effort is just amazing. I mean this cd shows more talent and carisma than most artists out today. Its about time someone put out a cd that will spark the interest of music and nonmusic listerners. This is also a cd that you can take just about anywhere. You can play it on the job, on the drive home, while cooking dinner or just when you feel like relaxing around the house. This has become one of my personal favorites and I urge anyone who needs a little rest and relaxtion and something to listen to while doing it, to go pick up a copy of this cd. It is just amazing!..."
5,Feng Shui and Great Music,"I just listened to this CD and I love it. I already know a lot about Feng Shui, but I learned more from Lillian Too. It's great to be able to listen to her tips and try them in my room at the same time--and the music is great too!"
5,Great for beginners!,I am new to the Feng Shui scene and I found this set to be incrediably helpful! What a great way to learn about Feng Shui and dive right in! If you are on the ledge trying to decide to buy it or not I would say GO FOR IT! I liked it so much I am buying a copy for my mom for mothers day and one for my best friends birthday next month!
3,good introduction to torah....but,mr lancaster gives a good introduction to messianic judaism but assumes many rabbinical teachings as true such as the jewish calendar among other traditions and oral torah commandments...
1,Restoration: Returning the Torah of God to the Disciples of Jesus,I was disappointed in the truth presented in this book. I perceive it to be an attempt by a Judaizer (Lancaster) to convince Christians (New Covenant) that they need to participate in Judiasm (Old Covenant) in order to fully appreciate their Messiah (Jesus Christ). Nothing could be further from the Truth of the Word of God (Bible).
5,excellent reference book,"I can highly reccomend this book as an introduction to Torah for believers in Yeshua.After several years of investigating and being convicted by the Lord in relation to Sabbaths and festivals etc.I feel the expression of my faith in Yeshua is best expressed in this Biblical lifestyle.After a ""lifetime "" in evangelical christianity it's been hard to re train and un learn wrong teaching.This book serves as a reference for us and a help when we want to explain to others what is our scriptural basis for the change which has taken place in our lives.It can also be a base for discussion groups for those who are seeking truth.SARAH Spain"
3,Above Average Recording of Two Seminal Scores,"These two pieces by Stravinsky are seminal--they are performed and listened to by enthusiasts throughtout the world since their introduction.Bernstein here aptly conducts the Israel Philharmonic. My choice for the Firebrid would be Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra, while Ozawa and the Boston would be my choice for the premier recording of The Rite of Spring.Bernstein here at times is too highly interpretative of Stravinsky."
5,Zombies Rock!,"This cd is awesome! The Zombies had a unique sound. The selection of songs are definitive Zombie tunes. 'Summertime' has a really jazzy, mellow feel. The organ dominates most of the songs to give it that Zombie edge. A must for any 60's fan. I play it over and over."
2,2 exceptional songs withstand the test of time,"""Tell Her No"" and ""She's Not There"" are as good as I remembered them to be.:Jazzy melodies.Nice beat. ""Leave Me Be"" is reminiscent of The Cranberries. ""Summertime"" has some jazz undertones not fully developed. The rest of the songs arenot so memorable."
4,good laughs for dry humor,It's a great movie for fans of Stella. A lot of dry humor and acting so terrible and corny that you must laugh.
3,A bit flat,"This movie has its moments, you may laugh a few times, but it never quite reels you in. Michael Showalter, playing the baxter, is not a convincing leading man, never endearing us to him. He's very stiff and over-the-top-geek. You never really root for him to get the girl.There are some great performances from Michelle Williams, who plays the adorable, sweet, smart love interest. And Michael Ian Black is hilarious as the baxter's underwear-clad friend. Sadly, their performances are not enough to save this movie and make you care whether or not ""the baxter"" will always be a bachelor."
1,I have no excuse for buying this,I'm not really sure why I bought a movie I had never seen. It's embarrassingly bad. The quality of the dvd was fine though.
1,simply terrible,"this movie was too painful to watch - we left after 15 minutes - stupid characters, not funny - dont waste your time"
5,Awesome!,Absolutely LOVE Shooting Star. As a kid in Cincinnati I could never understand why this band didn't grab America by the ears and rip 'em off.One of the all-time great rock bands. How about a re-reunion - Van?? Gary?? Boys???
3,a little dated but quality nontheless,"yes,it does sound a little dated but tracks like hang on for your life and breakout are timeless.hollywood is a fantastic ballad and this was an album way ahead of its time.if you can look past the 1981 production values you will like this one."
3,BOGUS!--2 songs Missing,"Short and sweet; These are 2 great albums, but when I received it,I realized 1 track from each album was omitted. These aren't even remastered. I have since ordered them seperately remastered. Just goes to show ya have to really watch what you're buying. I kicked myself on this one."
4,Shooting Star - 'Hang On For Your Life' (V&R Records),"Originally released in 1981, as this was Shooting Star's second album. Best described as well-played Midwest rock & roll. Tracks that I remember getting heavy airplay many moons back are ""Flesh And Blood"", the inspiring title cut ""Hang On For Your Life"", the rousing ""Breakout"", ""She's Got Money"" and ""You've Got Love"". Do keep in mind that to get the absolute most out of any of Shooting Star's CD's, you should be big fans of long-running '70's names like Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, April Wine and Styx. Enjoy."
5,It never got any better than this,"I think that most fans of the band would agree that this is Shooting Star's finest moment, having been given more airplay on AOR stations than the debut or any of the three albums that followed. Shooting Star was one of the bands that I always expected to be the next big thing, but for some reason after this strong effort, they failed to take off. Too bad. This album is a killer. For my money, Flesh And Blood, Hang On For Your Life, Are You On My Side, Hollywood and Breakout deserve to be on any compilation album from 1981, but it seems that Shooting Star is all but forgotten when it comes to eighties nostalgia. I guess that's okay though. After all, how many of us will ever listen to Centerfold or I Love Rock And Roll again without wanting to inhale a bullet?"
3,oxford dictionary soft wear,"I'm looking for a soft wear Oxford dictionaty ,NOT translator.with the list 500 000words and phrases."
4,Great soup and bread reference book!,"We had the book when it first came out and used it often, when we realized that it had been lost we knew that we needed another!"
4,cookbook review,"Good, old, tasty recipes, albeit high in cholesterol for some. Cook can always substitute olive oil etc. Well tested recipes. Good instructions."
4,Good!,"I bought this book,and I really loved it! It was very fun to read because interesting questions are made by kids who have a little problem and they want advice. For example, people ask about what to do when you have a bully at hands, or how to deal with death. Except, the questions are more specific. It's really good, and helpful. It just doesn't make a perfect 10, but belive me,I highly reccamend it!"
3,Liked Other Books Better,"This book is okay but I like the Legacy Press girls books better. They talk about more stuff than just boys and clothes and stuff. I like the books ""God's Girls"" and ""The Christian Girl's Guide to Being Your Best"" and the Pony Tail Girls series. You should read these books and you will get better answers about life."
2,"Lenox Laurel Leaf 70-by-144-Inch Oblong / Rectangle Tablecloth, Ivory","This tablecloth was supposed to be 70 x 144. It is actually 69 x 137. Quite a bit of difference if you need 7 more inches in length. The inch width shortage is a moot point compared to that length shortfall! Rather than send it back, I had it cut down to a smaller size that fits my table minus one leaf. So buyer beware! If you order a tablecloth, measure it before you need to use it so you have time to return it if something is wrong with the merchandise.The fabric seems sturdy to hold up to repeated washings but it is definitely NOT stain resistant. It does resist wrinkling. Am not at a total loss, but -Would not recommend to a friend and will be extra cautious next time I buy a Lenox tablecloth from any one."
2,Service not satisfactory,"Ordered for Thanksgiving; came much too late. Nice tablecloth, good price; just came too late and decided it was not exactly what I wanted."
3,"An interesting read, but not life-changing","Chase's book has been hyped as a cutting-edge look on how we should do business and marketing on the Net, and while I found many of his commentaries enlightening from a traditional marketing view, I didn't find any new material nor anything ""cutting edge."" Where were the prophetic statements we were promised? And who is the mysterious coauthor mentioned on the title page (Nancy Hanger)? Is she the ghostwriter for the book, or a Net-expert developer for the marketer (Chase)?For people who know nothing about marketing and very little about the Net, this book may be of good help. For those who are looking for new directions and are already Net-savvy, they may be disappointed."
2,Larry Chase is the Gomer Pile of Web Marketing.,"If you like your information 230 pages wide and one inch deep then you'll be glad you spent your money...otherwise, forget about it. You'd be better off using a search engine to get what you need."
5,Implements strong marketing principles relevant to the net!,"No whiz-bang gen-x mindset stuff here. Useful easy to understand business and marketing practices that are current and relevant to the net. This book will give you a practical and educational edge. Definately useful, easy reading helps too."
3,When loving is a crime.,"This book is rather slow in the beginning, but worth it when one finally gets into it.As a reader of modern times one cannot help but to compare today's standards to those of 80 years ago. Edie's husband is quite cruel to her. Whereas today there are so many ways for a woman to get out of a marriage like that, in those days, she was trapped. Even her family seems to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to her husband's shortcomings, seeing only that she is a married woman, and therefore 'secure.'The reader sees Edie become mature and insightful as the book moves along. In my opinion, however, there is not enough said about Fred, the reader never feels as though they 'know' him.This story is haunting in the fact that it is true. One almost feels Edie's helplessness and hopelessness as she writes letters to Fred from prison, letters she knows he will never see. In todays American courts the appeals would have gone on for years and years."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping this book would have some actual information about doing a restoration. All it has are lists of some vehicle specifications, and a spotter guide for each year that 442's were made. Everything is in black and white. Overall I was disappointed with the book. I am halfway done with a complete frame off restoration on a 1970 442 and I have not used ANY info from this book yet."
1,Oldsmobile 4-4-2 and W-Machine: Restoration Guide,"This book is not a restoration guide, it's more of a highlights book with pictures. More effort could have been put into this book with more detail."
1,hello thats not how school is,"how come this book thinks school is about...boys,firneds,hot outfits.thats not how my school is.some schools have unforms.and shool is not about hot clothes.school is about larening things not makeing things."
2,Well,"I have this book and I think it's cheaply made.School doesn't realy work that way as shown in the book.Overall,if there is somrthing this book can teach us is how not to act and dress in school.Honestly,we should take school more seriosly."
1,thats right,"the kid who worte ''hello thats not how school is.''is true.my school has to where unforms.here is the rules at my school...we can't kiss anyone,we can't hug anyone,we can't gossip,.you may think thats boring but thats how school is."
1,ugh,"When will MGA get it?? School is for LEARNING, not FASHION!!! And why are'nt the bratz seen in any classes? Hmm..."
5,The New Astrology: A Unique Synthesis of the World's Two Great...,I Purchased this book as a recommendation and I do like it a lot. Have read quite a bit of it.
4,very big!,"this good is a very long read, but interesting none-the-less. i was expecting this book to more about the two astrological system backgrounds and how they are connected, when in reality this book is mostly individual sign descriptions. with over 144 decrsiptions there are plenty to read about, but if your looking for a book more about your specific sign, then you may want to wait off on this one. However, being that i already had 1 or 2 books on my sun sign (a Scorpio), i was ready for this book and i am glad i made the purchase, it gave me a very creative and informative description of my scorpio/monkey sign combination and brought me into a new version of the astrology world. i highly suggest this book."
1,Taurus Rising,"Even a surface reading of ""The New Astrology"" exposes the fact that the text consists of little more than an inelegant highjacking of themes set forth in the writings on the topic by the legendary online journalist, Gus Mueller. Readers are strongly encouraged to bypass this ersatz material in favor of the original."
1,very biting and opiniated author,"i was so excited to get this book...but once i got it and started reading, it was written in a very cynical and biting manner. i was so put off by the author's very obvious opinions of certain signs that it just made it very hard to read. i was looking more for a black and white comparison and this was very colored and skewed by the author's own opinions. it seems to have been written more as a means of therapy for the author than a true objective comparison on the two different astrological signs."
1,You'll do better with a decent fortune cookie,"Anecdotally, this book misses the boat on just about everyone I know that I analysed using White's method. Wildly inaccurate, it sounded like someone who was trying to flub every interpretation.On the functional side, it's hard to really have much faith in a volume that has all the breezy style--and substance--of a lame newspaper astrology column. What starts out as being lighthearted soon becomes lightheaded, overwhelming the reader with an unbearably cutesy style. Reading this book cover to cover would be my idea of hell. If you like the idea of a synthesis of systems, stick with Liz Greene. Her work challenges you on many levels, rather than annoying you with just the superficial like this work does."
4,Fun! Fun! Fun! Compatibility section is right on the money!,"Contains an informative and interesting explanation of the two types of astrology in the beginning of the book. The author follows this with a general break down of the Eastern personality types. She then zeros in on more specific personality types by combining the Western Astrology Signs with the Eastern Signs. My friends and I have been amazed at the accuracy of the Compatibility section! But she doesn't just describe ""Love"" signs or the ""good"" side of each personality. The New Astrology gives both positive and negative aspects; the environment best suited for each personality; how they function within home and family; and suggested professions. I think it is the most fun when used in conjunction with, and as a supplement to, conventional astrology charts. So it's not brain surgery...lighten up!"
2,Very Interesting,"This book is well organized. However it does not describe things as one would hope. It gives vague descriptions of each category such as personality traits, love matches, and it contradicts with what I have read in other books. It does however come with a helpful chart to record data onto."
2,Not as expected,"Little analysis on zodiac characteristic while I expect more info.I'm not sure if the person who write this dislike of both Virgo and Goat, but from the reading, I sense a lot of negativity in their analysis. (while from other sources there are a lot of good thing from Virgo and Goat.Only have two page of info for each combined sign."
1,The New Copywrite,"Hopelessly derivative, this work is a pale imitation of the writings of the true pioneers of the New Astrology. Readers interested in primary source material may wish to consult ""The Musings of the Gus"" for the rise of syncretic astrology in the youth culture of the mid-1990's."
5,Must have battery / detector,"Since I bought a specific carbon monoxide detector that requires a combination battery / sensor a few years back, I have to replace the battery/sensor every 2-3 years. The replacement battery/sensor is easy to install."
3,Sensitivity,"This product is too sensitive!!! Even taking shower across the room makes the sensor to go off... If you burn little bit in your kitchen, it also goes off too quickly...VERY VERY SENSITIVE and VERY LOUD."
4,Let's Go Back to the Hop,"If you are old enough to remember these or just wish you were this is a nice compilation. It lacks the hard bass line that I remember, but then maybe we just always had that turned up high. The sound is good and with the exception of some selections it is a good selection to dance to or just sit and smile and remember the 50's. Included are:At the Hop, Stagger Lee, Lucille, Come Go with Me, Do You Wanna Dance, Party Doll, Yakety Yak, Red River Rock, Little Darlin', Honeycomb, Western Movies, Tiger, Willie and the Hand Jive, Teen Beat.The songs are sung or played by the original artists and will carry you back to the hop."
5,Libbey's right,"Ted Libbey's right--Karajan's 1975 version of the Requiem balances the orchestra and chorus masterfully, emphasizing the gravity of this composition. The orchestra is conducted with a preturnatural degree of precision, and the restraint in the singing seems just right, given that, for Mozart, this wasn't primarily an exercise in self-expression but--in my humble opinion--a declaration of the awful grandeur and bittersweet finality of death. The popular mythology about the writing of this piece (e.g. the film ""Amadeus"") is, of course, BS--but one wonders what Wolfgang would have done, what the kid had up his sleeve--this and the last 2 piano concertos contain moments of dissonance and spartan harmony the music world wouldn't know again until the day of Ives and Shostakovich."
1,Alltrade rotary tool,"I bought this product but was disappointed by the quality of the product. When using the attachments, I found they were not aligned properly when the collet nut is tightened and that basically negates the real value of the product. I will return it. Not worth spending the low price tag.ASIN # B000BD23QU"
3,"A nice film, nothing more","This movie gives one a good look at the way Irish is treated by the British goverment, and how innocent people can get convicted of crimes they didn't do, just because they are Irish. The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes it more interesting, but it is nevertheless a pretty dull film. I think it would have been better if they shorted it down a bit."
2,Watchable But Predictable,"This snapshot about the wounds suffered by the Irish due to the British is an interesting enough story, with consistent acting (Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thopmpson) and realistic, credible direction from Jim Sheridan. It wisely avoids over-the-top melodrama and even provides some moving scenes of a father and son relationship. However, as the plot unfolds, the movie starts losing its interest and becomes a familiar, average story about innocent and falsely-accused prisoners. At times, it almost seems like an ordinary made-for-tv flick exposing a prison tale, and the unsurprising and expected ending doesn`t help much, either. It also drags for too long, repeating its ideas and failing to engage at some parts. Overall, it`s not a bad cinematic experience but it lacks the punch and wit that it should have, and ends up being not too memmorable as a result.A somewhat worthy rental, still far from a must see."
1,Innocent?,This film will doubtless appeal to those naive enough to believe the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six are innocent and that the IRA are a loveable gang of carefree Gaelic rogues.
4,Nice work done!!,This mouvie was pretty good! It brought up a very good theme and it got right into my heart.I recommend this mouvie to people that are over 15 years old.WATCH IT!!!!
4,In the name of the father,"We liked the film because of the good actors/ actresses and the serious message. The movie shows how the Englishmen went into Northern Ireland. It also shows the problems with the IRA. Gerry Conlon, Guiseppe Conlon and some other people were convicted guilty though they were incent. They were Irishmen. You should absolutely see the film !!!! :-)"
4,A great movie from the Northern-Ireland conflict,"This movie is about Gerry, who was arrested for a bomb-attack in England in 1974, that he didn't have anything to do with. The story develops into a witch-hunt, with all of his family and persons he has been in contact with getting arrested. The fact that these are events that actually have taken place, makes the movie really capturing. The story is great and so are the actors. The setting and surroundings also are extremely well-made.If there was anything to set one's finger on, that has to be that the title of the movie wasn't all that suitable for it (In our very humble opinions). This because there isn't really anything to connect to the title until the closing scenes.But all in all, this is a very recommendable movie that really captures you. Well worth watching!"
5,Fantastic Movie! A must see!!!,"This is a must see for anyone who wants to know about the troubles in Northern Ireland. While this movie just covers a very small portion on what happened back in the day, it is a very profound movie. It is a true story, which makes it even more profound. What Gerry Conlon and his family endured over several years is heart breaking, just because they were Irish and in the wrong place at the wrong time. I highly recommend this movie. The acting is superb, and at the end I guarantee you will be shouting along with Daniel Day Lewis."
5,Brutally Honest,"It is hard to believe that this movie was indeed based on a true story. Conlon and his friends lost 20 years of their lives because of a mistake. Daniel Day-Lewis deserved an Oscar, and watch this movie even if just for Emma Thompson in the court scene. Stupendous acting."
1,Messy with poor pacing,"One would expect the Vienna Philharmonic to nail any Brahms Symphony regardless of who is conducting. In this recording, Bernstein's conception of the work seems so distorted that even the Vienna Philharmonic could not make it work. Case in point is how Bernstein handled the coda in the fourth movement. The final choral is played so slowly that the listener loses the sense of the actual theme. After the choral, Bernstein chooses a tempo that is so fast that the musician's can't keep up. The result is music that does not speak to the listener. It seems that Bernstein can only create excitement by playing things faster--to the point of complete mayhem."
5,Guests of the Emperor,"These women were prisoners of War. Food was poor and the captors brutal. These women merely existed for over four years. That is a long time to withstand torment, pain, and suffering. This book shows that War is hell. These women endured and showed great strength and courage. They made a movie about this book called ""Silent Cries"". It was very well done and brought this book to life. This book is exceptional. I would highly recommend this book to my family and friends."
5,chemstrips test strips,Chemstrip test strips Very easy to use easy to read very consistant readings good price for the amount of strips
4,Easy to use,"I have a dog that's diabetic, and to stick him for a blood sugar is difficult. I will occasionally use these to see how much sugar he is spilling into his urine. They are not precise, that's why people don't use these anymore...they use blood sugar meters. But if there is no sugar in the urine of a diabetic dog, that could be dangerous. Conversely, it the urine is reading 500+, then you know your insulin is out of whack. It's a good, easy tool to warn you if the sugar is too high or too low."
3,"Ok, but....","The colors are so close, it is hard to read, even in good light, and my vision is excellent. My dog has diabetes and I need to take a sample daily. I found it a bit frustrating that on the vial the colors are so close. I switched to another brand that had much more distinguishable results. This just didn't fit my needs, but good for someone who needs upper a d lower glucose readings and doesn't mind guessing at times."
3,difficult to understand when using it for blood sugar,"If you are using this product to test the blood sugar for your dog, it is a difficult product to use. I would recommend other blood sugar test strips instead"
2,REVEIW OF IPOD,The IPOD purchased worked only two weeks. I am in the process of trying to contact the seller to get reimbursement or replacement.
5,I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The best.....Very easy to use and convient. I am very impress with this product. Sounds great too!
3,So Far it's Pretty Good but...,"However, I have to knock it down to a 3 because sound quality isunspectacular. Is it too much to expect the mini IPOD to havegood decent eq options? If so, then shame on me. I think creative players offer much cleaner and varied eqs. There isno auditorium, small room, or my favorite ""garage"" eqs. Mostof the eqs on the mini are horrible and colorless. However, functionality of the player otherwise is fine."
4,Apple Ipod Mini,I am very please with my Ipod Mini. I did not think I needed a 20-40gig hard drive and a color screen was not that important so I think my 6GB is great. It is small and easy to operate while working out at the gym. I also got the ITrip FM Tranmitter so I can play through my desk radio at work or in the car. My only complaint is the battery life. I can almost play it continuously for 8 hours at work but I was sold that it had an 18hour life(maybe in standby).
2,Too many problems to be worth buying,"The Ipod mini looks cool, sounds good, and is easy to use. Unfortunately, it is NOT reliable. I have had too many problems with it skipping songs to recommend it to anyone. Please note that I have followed all troubleshooting guides and have updated the software. My neighbor has tons of trouble with the batterly life and other have problems, also. Stay clear."
4,I pod,I recently purchased this for my daughter and it still comes up as unpurchased. Please make sure it is not bought twice.
1,na not good enugh,ipod mini dont have:1. it doesn't have radio2. u can't recored radio3. u can't even recored ur own voice4. u can't fill da memory to da fullestZEN MICRO IS BETTER CUZ:just get da 6GB zen micro it lasts longer (battery life) u can fill da memory to da fullest has radio (fm only) u can record it and u can recored your own voice (voice memo)u can also use it as a memory card to store files
2,The ipod worked well,My wife was satisfied with the ipod. But the cord for use wih it didn't work. After buying a new one it worked great. Only problem was my wife was in phoenix when she found out it didn't work and i'm in michigan. So she bought the new cord while out there.
4,Six years and counting without failing,"I purchased my iPod Mini 6gb six years ago and it's still going strong, save for the battery, which is to be expected. The battery stopped effectively holding a charge several years ago, but most of my use is in the car hooked up to the charger so it has not been much of an issue. I did finally purchase a replacement battery, so we'll see how that goes.I've seen many many of my friends' iPods fail, so I don't know if I got lucky or the Mini is a better design, but I thought it was worth noting for anyone considering picking up a used or refurb Mini."
3,"Great product, dislike battery discharging","I have had my mini Ipod 6 GB for 6 months now and enjoy it very much. Its a great way to dump a whole bunch of CD'd into and bring them with you in a small package. I dislike however how the battery drains itself even when not being used. This is troubling since the battery has only a certain number of charges in it over its lifetime. If I fully charge it and don't get a chance to use it again for 2 weeks, when I go to use it the Ipods shows only a half charge. My daughter's Shuffle doesn't seem to discharge over time but then again it really only tell you when it needs to be recharged."
2,Propaganda Rather Than History,"The Costos have edited a volume which makes the Native American case against the Spanish/Mexican mission system in California. This is an entirely legitimate and plausible position to take, but the manner of its presentation here falls far short of normal standards for responsible history. Unsubstantiated rumors, personal diatribes, and factual inaccuracies take the place of careful research or any striving toward a balanced assessment. Students of contemporary Indian politics will nonetheless find some interesting and useful material mixed in the volume. As a whole, though, the mixture does no credit to its editors or its publisher."
3,At their best when not so bent,"Bent are afraid to admit they make beautiful music. It's true. When the duo (Simon Mils and Nail Tolliday) focus their will on making charming records the results can be stellar: ""Private Road"" and ""Swollen"", with writing and dreamy-dreary vocal support of Zoe Johnson, stir acoustic guitar, grand strings, and big themes into poignant ballads surfacing everywhere on chillout collections. Dittos for ""I Love My Man,"" spinning a 60's vinyl snippet from Nana Mouskouri into a simple yet beguiling love song.So perhaps the blokes were afraid of being tagged the ""next-Air"", or had an itch to display their sense of humor. Which leads us to `Exercise 1,"" a tired concept of spoken word excerpts on music, or ""Cylons in Love,"" manufactured kitsch with vocodered/robotized crooning. Not that these or similar others aren't somewhat enjoyable, just more forced or meandering (""Welly Top Mary"") than straightforward counterparts. Simply put, they're at their best when not so bent."
5,The Great Hank Snow,"I have every studiorecordings with Hank Snow in my collection of countrymusic. ( 1936 - 1985 )And I would say that his music and songs is something great and good.Sad that Hank is not with us anymore,but with this box his music lives on.So if you like Hank Snow,buy it and sit down and close your yes and listen to this songs.If someone can help me to find Hank's liverecording from the Grand old opry,you can contact me.Here's my e-mail:k.sorbring@tele2.se"
5,Fabulous!,"Briefly, amazing sound! I've never expected that my notebook(thinkpad T30 with GRADO SR-80 Headphones (or Shure E3c)) can generate this quality sound by changing sound cards. Although I'm not a audiophile, I can easily find some significant change in the sound quality. In some way, I feel the sound quality is even better than that from my portable MP3 player (probably due to headphone amp in the Echo INDIGO... ). Anyway, This product is for somebody who wants to listen to music rather than play game since the sound quality is too good. I tried Creative Sound Blaster audigy 2zs (PCMCIA) and it was a tatally disappointing experience. If somebody want to listen to music rather than play game I believe purchaing ECHO INDIGO is a much smarter choice as long as you don't have 5.1 or 7.1 speakers (Frankly, since I've never experienced 5.1 or 7.1 speakers I cannot make sure it improves sound quality a lot...)."
3,Worth the read,Interesting read... Spend a few hours in this and it will get you thinking. Is the case now solved? Possibly not?
5,One of the best,Having just renewed my interest in the Jack the Ripper story I was looking for material I had not read before. This is one of the best books on the subject. It includes the Coroner's Inquest on all the victims and in doing so reveals information that surprisingly seems to have been ignored over the past century. The author analyses the Coroner's information and also presents possible other ideas on who the killer might have been
3,Very different,This bracelet is very unique. It runs large in size. I gave it 3 stars because the wires can stick your wrist and snag clothes.
4,Love and politics in the French music-halls,"""Paris 36""------------------------------This romantic melodrama is set amid pre-war Paris, as politics and crime swirl around a dying French music-hall. The film is packed with likable, sympathetic characters, although the script is a bit on-the-nose and prosaic. Still, it evokes the glamour and romance of a bygone time, the era when great tragic chanson stars such as Edith Piaf and Lucienne Boyer brought France to tears... Worth checking out if you go for that brand of nostalgia. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)"
2,Letterboxed,"This review is of the DVDs, not the show.Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct. But the DVDs are actually non-anamorphic letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap, direct-to-video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century."
1,"decent translation, but trojan horse software","I was initially impressed with the Oxford Spanish dictionary and it's TSR-based ""i-finger"" software, it has a hefty dictionary and lot's of regional variations of the use of Spanish. The big downer was that it bombed on me after a year of use, I bought the 2002 Oxford Spanish CD sometime ago, and apparently it has some kind of automatic time-bomb built into its code, it will no longer install after a pre-determined amount of time has expired on the computer, i.e., the registration code will not work anymore and it won't install. I used it on WindowsXP and found this out. It's their trick to get you to ""upgrade"" to the new version.I have an old but excellent Spanish-English dictionary at home, in book form, and there is no reason why a CD can't remain the same after years of use. Obviously the greed factor has deterred the authors of this software from making this work for the rest of us. Buy it for cheap, but be forewarned!"
1,Expired Dictionary,"I have iFinger 3.0 which I downloaded after purchase. But when I downloaded the vista 64 version of ifinger, my dictionary now says expired when I tried to re-install it on the new computer. They have refused to comment on this and I am not going to buy another dictionary from them."
4,Practicality,"This English-Spanish dictionary is very useful, efficient, specific and quite complete.I am now definitely an enthusiast of the Oxford pop-up dictionaries as I have installed the English dictionary, the Thesaurus and the Hachette-Oxford French-English dictionary as well and use them effortlessly, on a daily basis, as much for work than for pleasure."
3,"After 1st install, forget it!","This program worked fine for me, for a while. It is neat in that the pop-up is handy when trying to use it, say when you come across a word you don't understand in Spanish. However, it did interfere with some of my other programs which caused me to disable it until needed. My main issue with this program is when you need to install it second time. I reformat my hard drives every six month or so. The program is nearly impossible to install the second time. The help desk is not very helpful with this. It takes me almost 4 weeks to get any help. I am currently on another wait period for them to 'unlock' my access to their dictionaries. I will be looking for another dictionary with a much easier installation feature."
1,Horrible Dictionary,THis dictionary is horrible for everything. THis is why:1) Lack of translations2) Incorrect translations - especially legal3) Annoying pop up window that loves to bother you when writting e-mails4) Inconvient- no application with Office or even the hot keys5) Retarded license management - like anyone would like to pirate their dumb programEven free this product isn't worth it
3,sizes missing,"Does not contain more than photos and a small text box per creature. There is no mention of sizes, something of great importance when stocking an aquarium. For me, it is too quick of a reference quide. The information (and much beyond that) contained here can be found in Nilsen's ""Reef Secrets""."
3,Good pictures,This book has good clear pictures but very little written information about each picture.
4,Many years of great service.,"Gave me many years of great service -- easy to use, reliable, battery lasted a long time. Now chirping indicates the alarm needs to be replaced. Wish just the sensor could be replaced, as with other models, and not the whole unit (though the sensors are nearly the same price)."
5,5 stars for being a life-saver!,"Being a new parent - I'm extra cautious these days. You can't go wrong with the old saying ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" So, I definitely recommend this detector. It could save your life!However - and this contradicts an earlier review - please comparison shop a little before you buy..."
1,"Get a detector, but not from First Alert...","I think every home should have a CO detector in it.Having said that, avoid this one and any others from First Alert. I bought an expensive one from them, and it gave a constant scream. The silence button did not work. Customer service would only say it shouldn't do that. Someone suggested that it might need to 'burn-in' for a few minutes. So I sealed in a room surrounded by blankets to keep the noise down, and it could still be heard a block away four hours later.The store I bought it at exchanged it for this model, but the problems are just as bad. And again, no help at all from customer service. I have had my house checked and there are minimal levels of CO, but these detectors keep going off and deafening everyone around."
