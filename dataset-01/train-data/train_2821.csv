1,Horrible Product,"This product is a racket. Not only does it eat up ink at an incredibly fast speed when printing black and white word docs or photos but it won't let you print in black and white if one of the color ink cartridges is empty. I am continually buying ink for this printer, and if you're like me and print a lot of black and white documents you'll be very unpleasantly surprised when you're color ink gets eaten up by black and white prints. Right now, it won't let me print one word doc because the light majenta is empty, and I have only printed once since it was shown as being one quarter full. Save yourself the frustration and don't buy this product."
2,Not worth the price of the ink,"Didn't wait long enough to by this printer. No reviews were available. If I had known then (when I bought it,) what I know now (it's big, NOISEY, and VERY EXPENSIVE INK), I wouldn't have gotten this model.It's HUGE. Bigger than it needs to be. It's VERY NOISEY and takes a long time to start printing when you turn it on. Epson needs to figure out a better paper feed. Takes too long to access printer utility 2 to cancel a print job or to check how much ink is left. Would like to see a 'pop up' when ink is getting low and not have to go thru printer utility 2. Can't find Claria ink anywhere but at the Epson store. I've had my printer less than 2 months and have already spent the price of the printer in ink.All in all I am very disappointed in this printer. Will stick with 'lower end' Epsons in the future."
1,Decent Prints If You Get Lucky,"Worked out the box great, decent prints and fast.Then my nightmare began---with the blinking of the low ink light. I bought genuine Epson ink, replace all the tanks. Low ink light still comes on. Talk to tech support at length was told I needed 'T078120' not the 'T0781' ink I bought ? Huh ? It fits into the printer and even says on the box it works with the R260. Obviously the tech support people shouldn't have left their old job at McDonalds.Not willing to risk another $75 for a set of ink, I tried generic ink. And of course that didn't work. I have since been told that its possible the geniune ink I bought was old---seems Epson codes the date into the ink now so they can shut you off. So good luck while you're out there buying ink!For 10 years I'm only used Epson printers. But no more, this is the last one I'll buy. It turned out to be a $180 paperweight."
1,Ink Replacement will drain your wallet!!,This printer prints very good but my ink lasted less than 1 week!! The cost per cartridge is 13-18 per color. You can buy a bundle for 60-80 dollars but most include 5 colors excluding black so expect to pay another 15-18 for black ink. If you run out of one color the printer will not print at all because the Epson online help indicates you have to have all cartridges working before it will print. Money maker for Epson. The printer prints great but the cost to maintain this printer in not worth it.!!
1,predatory marketing,"I just bought an R260, then found that Epson has fixed it so it only works with Epson ink cartridges. DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER! If you do, you will be stuck with whatever price Epson demands for the cartridges FOREVER. I note that other reviewers say the printer is very ink-thirsty - I never got to the stage to find out, but the combination is truly frightening. No wonder they sell the printer with ink for little more than the ink alone. It is a con game."
2,Getting the tray to work!,"Tray rejections with the R-200 is part of the design flaw of the early models. While tech support says that the tray is warped and you need to buy a new one-or two, it usually is just worn. Try this: First check the lip for warping, if it is warped, heat it with a hair dryer on high setting and flatten it between two flat surfaces. If it's worn, place a thin, and thinned, layer of clear nail polish on the wear marks on the bottom of the leading edge. The leading edge is that thin, clear, plastic lip on the edge of the tray. No nail polish? Try a very thin layer of super glue as I did, over the entire clear strip. But definitely make sure it is dry before you print. Seems to work great. OK product, stinking design and not at all helpful company-their fault, they should make good on it. Go for an alternative if possible."
1,Don't buy this waste of money and ink,"Since my previous review vanished, I figured I'd do another one. This printer is awful, it will actually dump ink into an ink sponge. If you run out of color ink, you will be unable to print in black and white, as the printer will lock itself. As other customers have stated, replacing the cartridges is a pain. I will never purchase an Epson product again, my frequent emails to their customer service have only garnered cookie cutter replies."
1,Epson Stylus Photo R260 is a dog,"I have owned 8 different Epson products including other printers and have always been very pleased, until now. The Epson R260 is a cheap, poorly designed and built ink hog. I mistakenly thought it would be a step up from the Epson R200 - an excellent well built model which I wore out from overusing it. The R260's ink cartridges are smaller, though the price is not. The cartridges are not as easy to view or load. The printer is much louder than other models I have owned. It even feels like cheap, flimsy plastic, unlike other Epson models I have owned. Avoid this model unless you rarely print. It is a good price - if you don't print much and don't need a machine that will hold up to much use."
2,Disapointing,"While Epson printers have outstanding print resuts when used properly, I had a very negative experience when one of mine broke within 3 months of purchase. Epson would not back their product or even give telephone support without a hefty fee. I also learned at that time that their print head is not on the ink cartridge as most printers are but on the printer: this means that you do not get a new print head each time you change ink and when the quality of the prints declines you must purchase and install a new print head. I much prefer HP products, despite the potential for great results possible with Epson printers."
2,"Nice printing, scandalous ink consumption","I want to get rid of this thing before it bankrupts me. I think the solution is to have another printer for everyday use and save this for showy DVDs and high-res photos. There is no excuse for the outrageous expense, and inconvenience, of replacing these cartridges constantly. I feel like an ink junkie who needs to hold up convenience stores to support my addiction. This is just plain exploitative."
2,Great Pictures but Wow I can't get the cartridge out!!!!!,"I love the quality of this printer. I have had so much fun printing Cd labels. Unlike the other reviewers, I was actually surprised that the ink lasted as long as it did. I don't know if I just don't do as much printing as others but I was surprised. My problem was in changing the cartridges. It is very hard. I presently have two that won't come out at all. I have sent an email to Epson but I am ready to throw the whole thing in the dumpster. My fingers are so sore from trying to get them out that I am thinking of buying another brand. When I bought it, the reviews were pretty good, but there were some who said it was expensive to get the ink. I was prepared to spend the money for good pictures. I replaced the cartridges once with no problem but now I am unable to replace the ones that are empty. It doesn't work at all with empty cartridges so I can't use it all. I will probably buy a Canon........"
3,ink sucker,"print very well, but ink disappear very quick and is very, very expensive. the 6 cartridge is more expensive them the printer itself.what I'm doing is buying a new printer for less them the price of the ink, open the box, remove the 6 cartridge, and sell the printer without the ink, or just throw them in the basement for now."
4,Vater Vintage Bomber Beater,"Sounds very vintage. Replace my old Speed King beater with this one, and it definitely gets that older sound. The shaft is a little bit odd of a width, and I've found it sometimes doesn't fit into some pedals. But if it does, it works really well, and sounds awesome. Love the feel it adds."
5,little people like Little People,"Good toy. My neices love it, and play with it a lot. Lots of imagination!"
3,Not so hot,"Bought this for daughter who does love it. But there are design issues I'd have thought would have been worked out by now. I was growing up in the 80's and Fisher Price had much nicer play houses then that were larger and had more rooms to them. This one is much differently designed, smaller, less rooms. It has sound effects to it which could be nice: phone rings, doorbell, toilet flushes. But the toilet only flushes if you RAISE the lid ????? and should flush when you lower the lid. The front door NEVER stays on. You don't even have to mess with it much like open it, you touch it and it just falls off the hinges because they didn't make them well. Overall daughter loves it (nothing to compare to) but as a parent I'm disappointed."
4,Gift for grandaughter,"My daughter-in-law recommended that I purchase the Little People Busy Day Home. I really liked the organization of the house, the way the little people can sit in each room, the sturdiness of the house. My grandaughters (twins) really love the Little People toys and videos, that is the best reason to buy something."
3,Scotty isn't Jack the Ripper after all,"Kind of a spooky episode, but it gets a little dull when everyone is brought on board the Enterprise."
3,Name a little confusing,"Although there is noting wrong with the golf method advocated on this DVD, I had thought I was purchasing the Natural Golf Swing Motion by George Knudson. Because Knudson's book and DVD have a title very close to the one I purchased, my Amazon search led me to believe that I was purchasing the Knudson DVD when in fact I was not. I take part of the blame since I should have looked more closely at what I was buying. I guess I was so happy to see the Knudson DVD for sale (which is very hard to find) that I overlooked the slight difference in title."
1,"dvd cracked, cannot play","I live in Thailand, I had the DVD sent to America. When I visited, I did not open it, but packed it in my carry on luggage. Upon arrival in Thailand, when I went to copy it, so I could play it here, I discovered it was cracked and unplayable.I am past the return date, but even if I were to rturn it and have it shipped back here, the cost would be around $40.00.If the seller had inspected the product, he would have seen it was cracked.poorly done."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM ! The recording is wonderful but the first 3 tracks have interferrence blotches that erupt every 20 seconds or so. If you select the ""Listen"" arrow on the left side of those first three tracks, you'll hear the crackling. The rest of the recording seems fine. I would love to keep this download but am going to ask for a refund. Too bad, too."
1,Save Your Money and Do NOT buy this detector.,"I have owned and used several detectors. My last one was stolen so I wanted to purchase something more computerized and took a chance on this one. The first think I noticed that I did not like was that its slow in responding. You can pass over metal and then you get a signal away from it. When trying to pinpoint an item the detector will not work at all, no signal, sweep fast and get a signal. I also noticed that the ground balance does not work. After a few minutes of use you can actually touch copper pipe with the coil and it will not even get a signal. You have to turn it off and back own to reset it. I tried contacting the company several times but never got a response. I wasted my money on this thing and ended up giving it to my daughter to play with in her back yard.Do not get Shanghaied like me. It's a Chinese made piece of junk that pretends to be a wonderful marvel of technology."
5,Excellent. It improves my flexibility in just 7 days!!!,I think Jean Frenette is the best stretching instructor. I tried using almost all stretching programs/books/instructional tapes of different Martial Arts Champions/Instructors but nothing gives me not only safe but effective results.
2,Strange book!,"I've read many business books and purchased this book simply because of the title. The tone of the book is a drill sargent giving you orders, some of which include commanding you to do push-ups! Some of the suggestions are downright stupid, like spending a day naked so you can say you started with nothing. Last I checked, EVERYONE is born naked so anyone can make this claim.The book's basic recommendation is to spend less, so you can invest more. Have a good attitue, work smart and hard. Don't give up, persistence pays, etc. Get the picture?There isn't anything really new. I think that the classics like ""Think and Grow rich"" cover the material better. One strange item toward the end was the suggestion to join a Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) program to learn and eventually create a new MLM company! God forbid that anyone takes that advice!There are a lot of references to other books and materials on the web, which might be of use to someone just getting started."
4,Fever Tree - 'San Francisco Girls' (Gear Fab),"Not so much as a compilation, but a worthy reissue of the Houston psychedelic band's debut 1968 lp plus seven unreleased bonus tracks. Liked both versions of ""San Francisco Girls"", the catchy ""Man Who Paints The Pictures"", ""Party Anytime"" and the CD closer - a true rarity, ""Houston Radio Commercial"" adverising their upcoming concert for Saturday night way back when. Might be aimed toward the completists and die-hard fans but this CD is still worth checking out."
5,Perfect to Retake the City,"I bought this beret after I found a bum doing some unspeakable deeds in the dumpster behind my bar in Phillie. After me and my friend donned these berets with black sleeveless shirts, Kaki pants, and red suspenders we cleaned up the city perfectly. The beret really made the look and intimidated the bums."
4,"Too hard for young kids, but mom LOVED it!","I bought this for my 8 year old, and I feel it is way too hard for young kids. I am in my 30's and once I started playing, I couldn't put it down. I absolutely LOVED this game. My kids had fun watching me, but were a little sad that it was so hard. The levels can get confusing, and there are 5 episodes...so you can play for days. I did get frustrated at some levels, but if you walk away, and come back, you can either think your way thru it, or do it by accident. My thumb was sore after playing this. I recommend this game for anyone but young kids!!"
4,A bit confusing...,"The game is fun. I'm not saying it's bad or anything, but the directions are un-clear. I'm stuck on level 3 for that reason. I MIGHT buy it if I were you, but you'd have to REALLY concentrate on the directions."
3,Melted in my airbox,This product worked great for a 5 years until the rubber surrounds holding the filter element melted in my airbox. This was a mess to clean as it was like wet pasty glue all in my the air filter element. Is it maybe because I am in brutally hot Florida or it runs in a notoriously high operating temperature car (RX8)? Maybe. The product worked good while it before it fell apart.The awesome thing is that Green Filter honored their warranty and sent a brand new filter no questions asked with no receipt and free shipping. Not sure if I could recommend with this car/climate combination.
3,"this book's ok, but the ending isn't the same as the movie","This book is fairly close to the movie with the exception of the ending. in the movie, Laura herself is the Light of Zartha, not the bracelet. The daughter of Princess Lauranna, she is sent off to the planet of Zartha to fulfill her destiny and rule her people.In this book, which, don't get me wrong, is good and hilariously funny, the bracelet is sent off to the planet of Zartha, and Laura is deneuralized and sent to her NYC home.that's about the only discrepency that i can see. Actually, the additional info in the other parts of the books helps fill you in on other areas, (such as, when Kay and Jay depressurized MIB HQs and fly in, it explains that the security guard was fastened into his seat with a chain so he didn't budge)Overall, I liked it, and i'd buy it again, even though it doesn't have quite the same ending."

2,I like MIB but.......,This was a very poorly written book. It would use a little more imagation. All of the extra stuff about NY really needed to be cut out of the book. It did go with the story.
3,Opinion,"I was very disappointed when this movie was very garbled about 3/4ths way through it. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie!!!"
5,Suspense packed THRILLER!,"From the very beginning Sight Unseen gets you all caught up in the mystery of what is going to happen next. Suzanne Barr wove each of her characters with depth and personality without overdoing them. Spunky Iris quickly became my favorite. When you start reading this book, be sure you have some time for yourself because you won't want to be away from it for long. Sight Unseen is an excellent spellbinding thriller from a gifted and creative writer."
2,Good But Very Easy to Guess,Everyone knows this stuff and if you already had the cds than this is really pointless2 best songs- brown sugar & heart breaker
1,"Save your $1,99",Wait for the re-issue version. you know they'll do it. Since the real box set of gems b-sides and unreleased stuff won't happen soon. They'll milk these first for the money... Two years tops and this will be remastered and re-released!

3,Great book loses cohesion,"This book starts off with fascinating chapters detailing how India is the world's great example of a truly functioning mulitcultural society. Sen shows that many commonly accepted ideas on India are simply the result of right wing Hindu and Western colonial propaganda. His chapters on Tagore and his exploration of Buddhist and Muslim contributions to Indian civilization should be required reading for anyone interstes in Indian history.But what starts off as a potential classic, loses all cohesion as Sen starts throwing in revised essays and lectures, some dating back from as 10 years ago. A good read becomes a textbook, dreary, pedantic, and even tedious. A disjointed effort, but worth a look nontheless. Check it out at the library, or wait a few years for the price of a used copy to come down just a bit more."
2,Sen has done better,"I'm typically a huge fan on anything Amartya Sen writes, but I found this collection disappointing. It seems to be a rather haphazard collection of otherwise unconnected musings. While there are certainly some gems, it seems more driven by a desire to pull random pieces together rather than the usual intellectual dynamism that drives Sen's other writing."
5,Interesting read,"This book is a must read for anyone wanting to know all aspects of India's history, culture and identity. I particularly liked Dr. Sen's writing style and extensive foot notes.I also think that the author could have avoided direct conclusions based on NDA's election debacle (some of which are not statistically proven)."
1,This is even worthy of being called a book,"Some fonts were so small I had to squint through a magnifying glass. Most of the pictures were of very poor quality. Thought I might get the sequal, but after reading this one - I wouldn't waste my time with the second. Great song/worthless book!"
1,Improperly named!,"While I'm sure this is a great DVD+RW product (my computers works great with it), it is NOT a DVD-RW. The ""-"" and ""+"" specify the format and often determine how it can be used.I bought these specifically to be used with my DVD-RW video recorder, which incidentally can't use DVD+RW, so this was a waste of money for me. The product even has ""DVD-RW"" printed right on each DVD, even though it's a ""DVD+RW"" product.I'm very unhappy about having spent money on the wrong product because these guys can't label their product correctly."
2,Useless for Sharp DV-SR3U recorder,"According to the labelling on these DVDs, they are -RW (not +RW) media. But my Sharp DV-SR3U rejects them with the message: ""This is a non-standard disc. Remove it.""Back to Memorex media for me."
1,"Frustrating, time wasting product.","Having used TDK (non DVD disks) for many years, based on this past experience, I purchased 2, YES TWO, spindles, 50 DISKS. A disasterous decision. If any would be purchase of these disks would like to experience, computer crash, DVD drive lock-up, multiple and incorrect information about individual disks (disk empty, disk full, cannot read disk, unkown format, windows incompatible disk) then purchase these. After wasting time on 10 of the disks, I eventually salvaged 2. The remaining 48, into the garbage. The rating for these TDK disks should be -5, that's minus 5!!!!"
4,If you don't own this- buy it!,"We purchased this game because of our little boy likes Scooby doo. Our son likes to try to play it, he can move Scooby doo around and get scooby to eat scooby snacks but its way too hard for him to actually play and understand this game, although he is almost 4. It is a fun game and my husband and I take turns at it, when one of us gets frustrated with it, the other one will take over and try to get past that stage. Its got a ton of levels, lots of little cartoon clips and you can collect cartoon clips and watch a full length cartoon- very neat! We have'nt gotten 1/2 way with the game yet, but its fun to watch the cartoon clips and all the original monsters are in it. You can collect the monster coins and go into a gallery and see them where they tell you fun facts about Scooby Doo and the Mystery gang. Its a really fun game- it is too hard for little kids, but its fun for them to watch and to try it out and its great for the older kids and parents to play."
4,"A little too difficult for ""Everyone"" to play","The ""E"" rating may mean it's appropriate for everyone to watch, but it certainly doesn't mean everyone can play it. My 6 year old wanted this game but now hardly ever plays it because it's so difficult. If they're going to make games for kids (this, and Nemo, for instance) they should make them playable for kids."
1,This game is NOT for a child!,This game is so hard for my youngster that he has gotten bored with it after only a short while. There are no real cheats for this game and there is NO easy mode. If your child wasn't born a gammer don't get it.. I did write to the company complaining about this game because it is marketed for small children but is too difficult for them to play.. They could care less! I won't buy another scooby doo game.
4,A bit challenging but fun,I thought this game was pretty challenging but fun and a lot of laughs... You would need to research game tips to get further but it is a great game...
3,Challenging and definately not for kids,"My husband bought me this for Christmas. I LOVE Scooby Doo, but find this game very challenging. I am by no means a game player and was looking for something to keep my interest, but at times this game gets so hard that I become frustrated and just want to get to a place to save the game. It stinks that you have to ""complete"" the level before you save. The sound effects are wonderful, but if at 20something woman has difficulty playing the game...imagine what the 5, 6, 7 year olds would be like."
3,A little book with a lot of Hopper,"Pocket-sized introduction to Edward Hopper from Abrams via Andrews McMeel Publishing, one of a series that includes Dali, Pollock, Van Gogh & others. Features a fine biographical essay by Justin Spring plus many illustrations, critiques & sidebar notes. The size of this book probably consigns it to the gift item category for someone you know who owns a coffee table collection of Hopper's works or who just enjoys artsy presents, which is unfortunate. A version of this book with larger prints would be quite good.Bob Rixon"
3,Unique writing style,"I have to agree with other reviewers who criticize this novel's plot. I found both the story and the characters to be irritating at worst and depressing at best. However, the richness of the writing kept me sufficiently interested to see the tale through to the end. The novel's contemporary literary quality combined with the personality of the landscape (a main character unto itself) as it is described make for at least an interesting read."
2,Painful to get through,Absolutely absurd book ... no rhyme or reason to the story. It was painful to hang on to the very end.
4,GOOD PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER,"Excellent writing for a debut novel, with strong characters. You do feel like you know these people and I keep thinking about them. Parts of the book are a page-turning delight. However, the last section of the book seems out of place. Suddenly all the characters are in situations that do not seem possible considering the buildup in the first three sections.However, despite, the last three chapters, this is an excellent book that will keep you up at night."
3,NOT Leather Bound as description states,"Despite the fact that Amazon's item description specifically says ""Leather Bound"", the Bible's packaging plainly states ""Imitation Leather"". This is too bad. I was really looking forward to using this version. It is a pretty good looking Bible though and I was tempted to keep it anyway but decided to return it and continue to search for one that is indeed real leather.If the item was as described I'd be giving it 5 stars. I'm only leaving this review to note the cover is not as described in this listing."
3,Misunderstood the product,I thought for the price it came with leather bound cover but it didnt so was disappointed. Book is fine but no bargain!
2,Great Content but Fell apart,"We love the extra content that is provided in this Bible. However, Within 1 week of purchase the pages starting coming out of the binding. Amazon was gracious and replaced it. However, the new copy was doing the same thing in a few weeks and we were out of the Amazon return period at that point. I recommend moving up to the leather bound to get a better binding."
3,agreed- the old is better,"... (If you are going to buy one, get the older edition.) The older edition had larger print size in a darker font. The paper in the previous edition was better too and didn't bleed through. I don't like to see shadows from the other side of the paper- it distracts. ""Modern"" is not always better, and is sometimes just cheaper quality. I saw this edition in a store and was thankful that I didn't buy it.As far as the content, the NKJV is still superb. Some of the articles seem bizarre, and, as a previous reader noted, inappropriate for the limited space in a study Bible.I'm glad that Jack Hayford is still the editor. The Spirit Filled Bible is still a great Bible! Maybe the next edition will revert to a superior product with all the old features. Maybe more articles on discipleship and church dynamics. (And, as long as we are making changes, go to a paragraph structure, like real English; there is nothing spiritual or functional about ""verse format."")"
2,Very hard to read and find you place,"I am having a very difficult time finding scripture and I don't like the word welth showing up uninvited. This hinders the readingand it is difficult to go to the references and get back to the original text. I love the version of this Bible as I bought theexact same in in Hard Back cover, but the printing is a bit small for me, even with glasses."
5,Great Study Bible,"I have an older copy of this Bible that I really loved. The electronic one took some to get to. If you really want to get to the meat of God's Word, you can with this Bible."
5,New Spiritfilled Life Bible,"Everything Jack Hayford does is excellent, thorough, well thought out and annointed. This Bible is no exception. I am enjoying reading it."
3,It's too hard to navigate!,"I think I'd like this kindle bible better if it wasn't so hard to navigate, and find certain books of the bible and everything. But, I do Like the studying part of it."
1,Kindle version really needs help.,"I have the physical version of this Bible and really enjoy how easy it is to study with. The introductions, word studies, and commentaries really immerse you in whatever scripture you are reading.Sadly, this experience was not translated to the Kindle version. What was a call out, intro, or commentary in the physical version is displayed inline in the Kindle version, breaking up the scripture over sometimes several pages. There is also no way to go directly to a specific book or verse without several taps through the table of contents.Overall, the Kindle version needs a *lot* of work to not only be useful, but readable as well."
5,Life changing investment.,"This bible has taken me much deeper in my understanding of the Word. Every morning when I open this book I am challenged and educated on biblical history, His Story.I highly recommend this book for the mature believer who is looking to dive deeper into the Word of God."
3,"Great Bible, but check for missing pages.","This is a great Bible. The Word Wealth and detailed notes and cross references are done very well. The print may be small for some, but that is common in many Bibles. The red ink is fairly faint.Most important though... if you purchase, please check carefully before you start using it and ""making it yours"" with notes and such. Mine was missing several pages. It's hard to notice until you go to look up a verse and discover it's not a part of your Bible. My missing pages were in the 320-350 range. Other reviews mention different page numbers, so check thoroughly.The quality of the genuine leather cover (not bonded) on mine is far inferior to other bonded covers I have had in the past. I think they're just making these things with lower quality these days - sad. Hard cover might be the better deal, considering the lower quality bonded leather."
5,great product!,This Bible is wonderful! I have been using a hard cover that I had bought a number of years ago but the binding blew out in no time....I was very disappointed! This one is awesome and the price was perfect for the style. I recommend this book.
3,Disappointed but not of the content,I love the cover of the book which is very attractive. The book of itself is difficult to read because of the print which is extremely small and the paper very thin. I am having a hard time to start reading this book. It is not worth the cost so I turn to my other bible. The size print should be a bit larger.
1,Disappointed,I don't really know what the Bible was like. There were pages glued together and one entire book was missing. Since I bought it in October as a Christmas gift it could not be returned.
5,"New Spirit-Filled Life Bible, New King James Version: Kingdom Equipping Through the Power of the Word, British Sable, Genuine Le","Looked for this Bible for a few months..finally found it on sale ..I am thrilled & would & have recommend it to everyone. Ease to read,not to big,not to small. The New King James Version is a must to have..I see alot of ppl & ministers are using it now.You will not be sorry to have this Bible in your hands."
4,Spirit Filled Review,"This Bible was recommended by a friend of mine and I must say that I like it very much. It is similar to a study Bible, and it helps me to study God's word more indepth instead of just reading, the insets Word Wealth and Kingdom Dynamics) are very good. I would recommend anyone to purchase this Bible"
5,Great Study Bible,This is one of the best study Bibles I have ever used.It has wealth of information in it.This also is not to bulky too handle.I love the Kingdom Dynamics sections in it.I would recommend this Bible to anyone.I have used several different study bibles but this is the best one I have used.Most are to bulky to handle but this is not.Love It!!
2,No indexing on Kindle version,"Love this version of the bible. However, I just bought the Kindle version (I have the Kindle 3) and it does not ""index"". Thus, I cannot type in a search for a specific verse. Very Bad for a bible. Can anyone help?"
1,Kindle version - No Index to navigate NT 02-25-2011,"This appears to be a wonderful Bible, however the Index feature is not available, at least not for the New Testament. I tried searching, too, but could not navigate around. The many study features looked great, but I am not willing to page through so many features while trying to get to a particular book in the Bible. I have returned this one."
5,bible,this is a very good study bible. just wish the print was a little larger.A friend recommended this one to me.Glad I took her advise and bought it. I have several other study bibles I also like that it has red lettering it seems like a lot of them don't anymore.
3,Disappointed,"This is my favorite study Bible, but this one has ink problems. some of the red is bright and some so faded it is hard to read."
3,Study helps are good but. . .,"I recently ordered and received this Bible. Overall, I like the study helps and insights it offers. However, I mistakenly thought that the cover was genuine leather. If it is real leather, then it must be an inferior quality, for it is by far of lower quality than the cover on my NIV Bible.I wish that this Bible came in the NIV version. New King James is ok but it is harder for me to understand, even with the study helps. I find that I am reading this Bible AND my NIV in an attempt to understand all that I can. It's probably not a bad idea to read different versions. Still, I would like this Spirit-filled Bible in the NIV version better."
2,Not what was displayed or featured,"While the content is what was expected, the color and binding is not what was shown in the picture nor the binding. The binding is not genuine leather, but imitation leather. Instead of teal blue and tan, it was true blue and tan. Say what you mean, mean what you say. Leather and IMITATION Leather are not the same."
1,Bible Fell apart,I purchased the Spirit Filled Life Bible as a Xmas gift for my wife. She had it less than a week when the pages started to fall out. I'm extremely dissapointed in this purchase and I don't have a clue how to return it.I really hate buying stuff sight unseen.Brian Croner
2,Product received does NOT match with website description,"Of course no complains about the bible itself. It's a great one!However, looks like Amazon is out of this specific black (sable) leather version whith ISBN #978-0718006181. Instead they ship a tan leather version with ISBN #978-0718006389, which costs $49.63 on the same Amazon. I initiated a replacement order, with a special e-mail pointing at the issue, but still received the wrong replacement. Amazon needs to update its website info and/or put ""out of stock""."
1,ITEM IS NOT AS DISPLAYED!!,"I recently ordered this Bible, and when I received it, instead of being the tan & blue leather with the picture of the dove on the cover as shown, it came with a plain dark red brown imitation leather cover!! And no receipt in the package!! When you post an object for sale, but the ACTUAL picture of the product and don't try to deceive people!!"
5,Great looking and layed out bible,"I had done a ton of research for a real good referance bible with being able to look at any while at sea. this was a great choice everything I was looking for with two book tabs, great referances, concordance, and many extras. Do your self a favor and make the Purchase, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Kindle version,"I love my regular New Spirit Filled Life Bible, so I decided to get the Kindle edition. It reads well, but someone needs to redo the format. It's easy to access the Old Testament, but to get to books in the New Testament takes a leap of faith, literally, you have to skip over all the stuff in the O.T. first, which is annoying. Once you get to the N.T. though, as long as you're just reading, it's fine. There has to be a way to better access the Word of God in the Kindle version. It's a great bible, just needs tweaking."
5,Excellent study bible,"Though I did not purchase this bible through Amazon, I wanted to write a review for it. As a new born again Christian, it has been a great asset in learning the scriptures. In the beginning of each book, it gives an in dept description of what the book is about, who wrote it, when it was written, the theme of the book, etc. It also gives a great outline. As you read each book, there are several notes at the bottom to aid in the understanding of each scripture.This book is not only for people who are ""new"" to reading the bible, but also ""mature"" readers to help give a more in depth meaning to everything.I would highly recommend this bible to anyone."
2,"Hard copy awesome, kindle version not so much","I have had an old school version of this Bible for years and have loved it. Unfortunately, it does not translate well not a Kindle version at this time."
5,Easy to read,I use this to further read from my daily reads! It's easy to read and understand what the message is saying....love it!
3,Could Be Better,"the print edition is excellent but the Kindle Fire edition isnt so great. If you open it where you left off, there is absolutely NO reference point and you have NO IDEA where you are. Also, the world wealths are links but then they are also immediately in the text making the links pointless. It would be much better to have the word wealths somewhere else, keeping the text together."
1,"Avoid like the plague. No wait, this is worse.","This OS does not work with 99% of all hardware devices due to its mandatory driver signing policy. This means that a hardware device and/or driver that does not implement DRM cannot be certified and therefore used with this OS. If you can, get the 32-bit version instead. Or better yet, get XP."
3,Worth watching once... if you plan to make the hike,"This is definitely an amateur video (from the dates on the footage, it appears to have been filmed in May of 2000). Most of the footage was taken while individuals were hiking and thus the shots are quite shaky. The film quality is that of your average camcorder (back in 2000).If you're looking for an overview of Machu Picchu or a history of the Incas this is not the video for you. Instead, you should purchase The History Channel's ""Lost City of the Incas"" video (also available on amazon). If you want to see a quick glimpse of what the experience would be like if you made the hike, then this video is for you."
2,Just like another one,"I have not listened to this CD, but I noticed that is has almost the same list of titles as another CD I have: ""All the Best of Belly Dancing; 25 great favorites."" The musicians and singers are not given. It sounds like three different albums, by three different groups.That CD has 12 more numbers, sung by a girl with a squeaky voice.The rest of the titles are identical, in the same order. ""Travelers"" through ""Hello"" are sung by a man, and ""Kabbir"" through ""Atlas"" have a clarinet player. The only ones I like are the clarinet pieces. If I knew who was playing, I might look for more of his work."
2,It could be better,"The only thing I really liked about this album was the fact that it would be good to practice dance to. I'm into both belly dancing and Middle Eastern music, and the music and the beats are ok. I'd have to rate this album pretty low though. Some of the music is pretty good on it, but lots of the songs sound almost exactly alike. I don't know if the Casbah Orchestra is an authentic Middle Eastern group or not, but the singer in the album sounds as though he's trying too hard to both sing and pronounce the language.My overall feeling about this album is: Not impressed."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I too have the same album that the first reviewer spoke of, and I agree wholeheartedly with the assessment. It's not a great album - no matter which of the three are being mentioned. Don't waste your cash on this one."
3,And the track list is:,"1. Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town2. Mama's Waiting3. Just Dropped In4. Heed the Call5. But You Know I Love You6. She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye7. Sunshine8. Reuben James9. For the Good Times10. Love Woman11. Me and Bobby McGee12. Tell It All Brother13. Something's Burning14. Elvira15. I Believe in Music"
3,No more insight than any other Kaufman video,"This special came out around the time of ""Man on the Moon"" and contains all of the basic rememberances from friends and co-workers.It is an acceptable overview of Andy's career, but really falls short of offering any groundbreaking material.You're much better off watching ""Man on the Moon"" and buying the ""Midnight Special"" DVD to see what Andy was all about."
3,Move around sections con,"This is the usual con the student effort.With the excuse of adding some new material, some sections and the assignments are moved around to make it difficult for the student to use the previous edition.It is more than overpriced when one considers that it is just a summarization of well documented standards.Shame on the publisher, shame on the author!!"
4,Good summary of networking circa 2002.,"For those of you interested in a lucid summary of the principles of networking. Tanenbaum summarises well the concepts behind the Internet Protocol, and the various stacks/layers. This is an easy book to shed some light onto topical buzzwords like CDMA, CSMA, TCP/IP, 802.11b (WiFi), 802.15, 3G, WAP, broadband wireless, i-mode...He gives enough details that can be understood by a reader with the equivalent of a sophomore level in science or engineering. The amount of maths needed is minimal. Some calculus and Fourier analysis and simple probability theory.Each chapter has an extensive problem set. My only quibble is that perhaps the problems could have been harder. A lot are simple plug-into-equation types."
5,A classic,"This is an outstanding successor to the excellent 3rd edition. Every employee of a telco, cableco, satco, cellco, IXC, ISP, VAN, systems integrator, and telecom equipment manufacturer should get a copy of this book, read it from cover to cover, and keep it handy in the office."
5,Suprisingly great.,"I loved this book. I just finished last night. Some of the stories were just perfect, but all were interesting and, at times, educational.Highly recommended."
1,HOW TO SYNC Songs,"I bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable, i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics, even though it is more its worth it!"
1,Bad Cable,"This cable shorts out the connection on my phone imediately after connecting. I do not recomend it. It costs more to ship it back then it does to replace it. I will chalk this up to ""you get what you pay for""..."
1,"Works for a while, but breaks after 2 months!","I had the unit for about 2 months, it starts with this non-recognition problem on certain CDs. Then it will progress to not being able to see any CD inserted at all, including brand new CDs just bought and not yet played. These CDs are all perfectly playable on my SONY CD player. What is crazy is, sometimes it would work perfectly as if nothing had been a problem! There's got to be some kind of weakness in the electrical circuitry inside... Keeping the power on all the time seems to help somewhat but not 100%. Customer support says unless it is purchased from an ""Authorized"" dealer, they refuse to repair/replace under warranty.Off to the dumpster it goes... Visually a nice design though, too bad it kinda have to also play CDs for it to be useful. Total POS, not recommended."
1,horrible product,"this is the worst product i have ever owned forget just stereo equiptment. I have never owned an item that worked so poorly from the day that it was bought. i bought it last saturday and will be returning it on friday. it never woked correctly. listen to these reviews. it doesn't recognize cdr's and many times does not recognize regular - store bought cd's. it looks cool and sounds good when it works, but it never works."
3,audio great; changer grinds,"the audio quality of the HK is wonderful, and it does have nifty programming features.But--the carousel grinds very loudly. louder than the music, and loud enough to hear from 2 rooms away. opening the tray is also very loud, and sounds like an old chevy motor. This is why it isn't a 5 star. i expected much better."
2,HARMON CD PLAYER,"We installed unit at customer's office, the player jammed and we couldn't play or get CDs out, manfaturer said to open unit to remove and we did, next day he complained again CDs not playing, we verified and he asked us to return unit and we're in the process of ordering a Denon unit...not too happy!"
1,Manufacturer's Defect,The CD changer would not open to receive the CD's. A call to the Company's customer service resulted in their decision that it must be a manufacture's defect so it was returned to the supplier for a replacement. The replacement is in progress. Attention from the supplier has been satisfactoty.
1,Very unreliable,"I bought this partly on the reputation of the Harmon/Kardon name. I was very disappointed. Very soon after installation, the unit would hang and stop playing disks. When it did play the disks, there was a lot of mechanical noise that could be heard when standing close to the unit. It also frequently would fail to play disks that were fine on other players. I sent my unit in for a warranty replacement. The new unit displayed the very same problems within 5 minutes of turning it on. From reading other reviews and from my experience, it is obvious that the FL8385 is a defective product and should be avoided."
2,Why is HK still making this unit?!?,"I bought this unit about two years ago, and I've finally had it. Aside from the very rare lockup when in random mode, it worked well for about a year. After that, it would periodically pull the same trick, with growing frequency - play a few tracks in full random mode, then just forget what to do - devolving into a series of useless clicks and refuse to do anything at all until shut down for a few minutes then restarted. I was convinced that my laser had gotten out of alignment somehow, and had just about resigned myself to spending the 80-100 dollars to getting it fixed, when I decided to jump on here and check to see if others have had similar problems. I'm glad I did. I just ordered a Sony unit through Amazon for not all that much more than I would have spent ""repairing"" my HK unit.Having been a long time owner of HK equipment, I still think they make superior sounding audio products, but if they don't work, what's the point?"
1,Harmon Kardon CD changer,This product is a piece of garbage. Broke after minimum use after a couple of years. All of my other cd players are still going. expected more from this manufacturer. won't by another harmon kardon anything.
1,Jammed after playing 3 CDs,"My wife bought me one of these for Christmas. I played 3 CDs, then tried to add another disk while playing Bela Fleck in the 3rd location. Unfortunately, the drawer would not close after. I pulled out all the CDs, recycled power, etceteras - but to no avail. Bela Fleck was captured in the unit! I took it back to Circuit City and they used screwdrivers to get my CD out. Needless to say, I'll be getting a different unit....."
5,The poet- essayist and thinker,"Emerson's poetry is not the major form of his work. His most well- known work are his Essays. And his poems share a certain quality with these essays as they are rich in ideas and moral probings. Emerson's most well- known poem is one which every American schoolchild once leared. It is the poem of the beginning of the Revolutionary War. "" Here is where the embattled farmers stood , and fired the shot heard round the world.' Emerson musings can be deep and also reflect his Transcendental philosopher, "" If the slayer thinks he's slain"" .One line of his diaries sticks in my mind as a particularly great line of poetry. This is when he ' walks across Boston Common glad to the brink of fear'.There is a tremendous richness in this work and much to be deciphered and enjoyed by the probing reader."
4,doctors said to take,doctor said to take for my joint paine i think it work real good it gives me more relife than some of the outhers out ther
3,You can find better..,"The major problem I had with this book is the lack of depth. The review is essence cannot really be considered a review, as it skipped major events. The writers of this book seem to have forgotten that this is an Advanced Placement test, and not an SAT II. Also, in the ""reviews"" are listed Key Ideas/Key Events, with just the name of the person or the event, no explenation attached. Imagine my frustrating when I see: Force Acts and Stevens' theory in bold, with no reference to these terms. Finally, the practice tests seem to be much harder than the actual test. Be skeptical of your score when taking the practice tests.All in all, it's not a bad book, but you can definately find better. Although not great, I found the Princeton Review book to be somewhat better."
3,So-so,It's a useful book to prepare for the examination but I'd be more inclined to recommend other titles that could be utilized. Solid facts. Sometimes not as detailed. Not enough practice exams.
2,ANOTHER depressing look at the worst of gay life.,"Along with Go Fish, and a few other rock bottom depictions of how ""WE"" (speak for yourself) live our lives, this is depressing. The far too typical poor production value across the board applies here. The sex is absolutely uninspiring. But beyond that, it adds one more layer of stereotyping; a view from the gutter. HELLO! Millions of us DON'T live in the gutter. Even a movie that portrays that kind of life can be done well, but apparently too many lesbians don't know how to make those kinds of movies. (thank God Nicole Conn gave it up!!) Buy ""Fingersmith"" or ""Loving Annabelle"" or even ""Tipping The Velvet"", some of the best lesbian movies out there."
2,This is not the ultimate short lesbian film...whatever,"I was so excited when this movie came out, but I was very dissapointed in it. There were maybe two stories that I liked outof 10 or so. There are not hot sex scenes!! Some of them were long and drawn out! Don't waste your time the title hold's high expectations but don't expect much!"
2,2 STARS???,"The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, is because it has ""lesbian"" anything in it...Total crap and waste of time watching this and while it touched on (just barely) some interesting subjects, I could't help but feel that I was being fed some more slightly stereotypical crap about what being a lesbian is like.And hey, there are so many great movies aimed toward lesbians these days (sarcasm) that I had to give it 2 stars for trying."
4,Seems to be a good device,I actually just bought this wireless remote. I attached my trolling motor in my shop vice and operated it with no problems. The weather is too cold now and I have stored my boat for the winter. I hope to be using it this next spring and expect no problems.
2,disappointed,A cute book but the light only stays on for about 5 seconds. You have to re-spin it several times before you finish the book. It really annoyed my 3 year old daughter.
2,"Good performance, lousy recording","I don't understand what the recording company for which Mango records is trying to do. The sound is badly distorted in all of his albums from about 1998 on. I can't advise you to buy it, because the sound is just terrible. The distortion sounds like over-modulation, trying to push the levels beyond where they should be."
4,Much better than the new Medal of Honor game!,"This is a very good game. Much more fun than the new Medal of Honor. The graphics and gameplay are excellent. The levels are not easy, but not impossibly hard either. The controls are confusing at first, but easily learned. The enemy AI is very good. The only drawback I have noticed so far is the ability to fly through tree's. Very challenging and worth the $. I'll definately still be playing this after I finish it the first time around."
1,IT DOESN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS-HOPEFULLY NOT,"I own approximately 20 ps2 games and I've never written a review before. This game was so bad and I was so infuriated at how terrible it was that I felt a civic duty to inform buyers to beware. The creators of this game must have never seen or played some of the more professional titles or their budget was so low that they couldn't afford the proper programmers to get the job done. I deem AC4 as the benchmark for flight simulation games and if it is a ten on a scale of one to ten then this title deserves a zero. I'm stunned at how many positive reviews this title received.....These players must be brain dead or else they work for the company that produced this garbage. The fact that it just came out and you can buy it new for $26 tells you a lot right there. You better rent it first rather than following the advice of your peers as this is a leming accident waiting to happen. (Whew, I feel much better now!)"
2,Game is a nose dive,"Being a private pilot, I guess I'm a little particular when it comes to games in this area. I've read reviews and checked out screen shots before buying, and unfortunately for me, neither told an accurate story. The control of flight is incredibly limited. There is no rolling (without which you can't dogfight well at all), bombing is basically impossible due to an out of sight crosshair, the computer seems to take over to level the plane out, and it takes forever to build up for hangar. You can loop, but that's about it. The best part of the game for me was defending a base from the ground with a huge gun. The game is easy, even on the tough setting. My suggestion, buy another game like Ace Combat."
5,"A great game for the ""non-serious"" gamer","I'll be brief - I'm NOT a serious gamer (or even close), I like to be able to sit for 30 minutes to an hour for some quick escapism without having to spend hours reading manuals and then spend 20-30 hours or more a week getting proficient. This game is excellent for that purpose. I found the story, graphics and variety of missions to be great and a lot of fun with a very short learning curve. It's not a flight sim - it's definately arcade type action. If you ""have a life"", enjoy history, and just want to have some ""shoot'em up fun"" this game is the answer - if you have bought other games and felt totally intimidated by their complexity, this game may be for you. I recommend it for pure entertainment enjoyment. BTW - I have the PC version and run on XP Pro w/64MB NVidia graphics."
5,20 out of 10,"When I got this game on crhistmas I was so surprised how good it was. Iw you like WWII planes you'll get this game. Some examples of planes are the P-38, Bf 109, me 262, Spitfire, P-51, a Russian IL2 and more. You can bomb enemys, shoot them down, and hit U-Boats with torpedos. You can also use Anti Air guns.It has challenging and fun levels such as Midway, D-Day, Norway, and much more.Your arch enemy is Krieger from nemis. At the menu screen that says new game and continue put in up, down, left, right, left(2), right(2), L1(2), R1(2), L2, R2. That might be it. It'll take you down to low health but don't be fulled by it. It'll say seceret code excepted. That's useful for D-Day. This is my altime favorite PS2 game. So if I were you I'd buy here now. Go get off the reviews and buy it."
4,Pretty cool,"I just got this game a few days ago and it's pretty fun so far. I am on mission 3 and have completed the first few challenges as well. Graphically it could be better but it's not bad either. The plans fly too ""arcadey"" for me though. I like the way the plans fly in ""Heroes of the Pacific"" better. But the plans so far are pretty neat. I am new to the WWII plane battle type games. There doesn't seem to be too many of them though. If you find this cheap somewhere and are into WWII fighterplane games, I recommend it."
5,Obsolutly wonderful,Everyone has game this game a bad score saying oh its not as good as Secret weapons over the luftfafa. But this is for the consoles so they made it more arcade style. This game is awesome the controls are responsive and tight the graphics are very good and there is alot fun to be had so with 30 missions and 20 different planes how can you go wrong. The missions stretch from england to russian to japan to germany its self. So if you like flying games love WWII or love blowing up stuff pick up the game!!!!!!!!!!
1,this game is a waste of money,I can't believe how bad this game is. If you buy it don't say I didn't warn you.
5,Dusty is marvelous,"If you like Dusty or just want to discover her songs, you will be thrill with this compilation. A must own."
5,books that ought to be read by all,i just love william----who doesn't. everyone who know that scruffy 11 year old will say the same. when my aunt bought a set of these books i thought they were just another set describing the misadventures of a set of kids. and then i met william--i am indian-and my cildhood was entirely different from williams--but i wish it was more like his-through war and peace william learns to have fun-.all his adventures or misadventures leave u in stiches---be sure to read them :-)
5,Great to See William Appreciated in the US,"As everyone says, they really are wonderful books. They remind us of the times (up to the 1960s?) when children lived very largely in a world of other children, both at home and at school, and interacted only tangentially with the adult world. And felt free to roam the countryside. In the UK, the William books are also available on tape, wonderfully read by Martin Jarvis. Surely a US publisher should take them up...?"
5,<<<MUST BUY NOW>>>,"My college roomate had this CD last year and it was my first exposure to ""trance"" music ever. Let me say, I've been hooked and in the scene ever since -- I'm a trance virgin no more!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY COLLECTION.Excellent for starters AND veterans alike. I've played this CD getting ready for parties AND falling asleep afterwards; it's very versatile with seamless mixes and long drawn-out suspenses.... just what trance is SUPPOSED to be, right? It's a well-spent $12 bucks and the songs are never ""aged,"" meaning they continue to be desired month after month, year after year. The songs are NOT commercialized with #4 being especially satisfying and songs #9-14 having an amazing build-up with intense energy. Happy purchase:)"
3,good trance music...,but sometimes a bit too agressiv for me. there are some really cool hammers on that cd with spacy melodies and pumpin' beats. I just don't like those trax with these screeching shrieking tones. there are better cds to buy
3,Old and played out tracks.,I bought this CD years ago and if you are looking for some new quality trance this isn't it. At the time is was hot but quite frankly the mixing is nothing special and the track selection is very played out now. The only track I can really still handle is Sasha's amazing Expander. Other than that this disk is pretty weak. There are some much better compilations out there so browse around.
1,Can't even muster the sigh...,"Rather than write a detailed, in depth review here, I'll keep this brief. This CD is just a roundup of catchy trance tracks. Mixed? Yes, but that's just about it's only strong point. Not that they're well mixed, either... Basically, this is what happens when tunes catch on."
3,Trance: A State Of Altered Consciousness,"This isn't a bad domestic release. With tracks like Kaistar's(BT), ""Promethean Groove,"" & Veracocha's(Ferry Corsten), ""Carte Blanche,"" with staples as ATB's ""9PM (Till I Come),"" The Argonauts'(Dave Ralph & Mike Koglin), ""Sommertag,"" & yes, even Sasha's, ""Xpander."" We sell a ton of this stuff on another poplular auction site, and are more than happy to recommend what titles we think are worth picking up. Feel free to shoot us an e-mail if you wish. Our e-mail address is jnaples@pacbell.net."
1,COMPLICATED FOR THE NEW INITIATE,"FULL OF DIFFICULT TO READ SMALL PRINTS YORUBA VERSES, WAS BARELY ABLE TO READ IT, FULL OF HISTORY BUT NO DETAILS ON YORUBA TRADITION, DIVINATION OR CUSTOMSI COULD NOT UNDERSTAND SO MUCH EXPECT SOME PRAYERS"
1,Worst Collection Ever!,"THis collection is really bad. Not only are more than half the original songs missing, half of the songs aren't even Bond themes. How this got to the shelves is a mystery.Don't waste your money. Get the 30th or 40th Anniversary Edition instead, they're a lot better."
3,Good book but not enough details,This book is great to get you excited about building a canoe. The basics are all there but there are details that are missing that would be helpful. It is definitely worth having in your library before you start your first canoe.
3,Wonderful,"Isaw him sing in Zurich 1950. I always thought he was wondwerful,hearing him on these re mastered 78s I realise that I was VERY lucky indeed. Superb Singing"
3,Pootie Tang Original Soundtrack,"This cd is not the best disc of music I've ever heard, but since I enjoyed the movie, I had to have the music to it! I'd say I only really like about half of the songs. It is missing some songs and loops from the movie which I wish were included. Overall all I'd say not a required buy but at the low price you can find it for...go for it."
5,The essential accessory,"I love my L3. So bright when compared to most other head lamps in the same general weight. I had been using the included C-cell pack for my battery needs so that I wouldn't have to carry the 4 AA batteries on my head.The band on the L3 is somewhat tight for a larger head and adding the batteries further constricts my head. Distributing the weight to your waist with this belt solves my problems. I have reduced my weight without having to put the batteries on my head.Seems silly, but this truly is so much better."
3,"Too Much Felten, Not Enough Dek-Tette","I like Eric Felten's Renaissance Man persona -- in music, politics, bartending, bandleading -- but he didn't police his vocal cords enough in this short album. I like his singing in other albums, but he scooped up to notes too much here, with a light tone, lacking the Sinatra power and assurance he seeks on other albums. The Dek-tette is a great sound, but they were caged in tight, short arrangements designed to show off the voice. More Dek-Tette, please, and more disciplined singing, too."
2,Stupid design!,"The batteries, if you can believe how dumb this is, are stored in the part of the lever that goes OVER the top of the book. Which is a very unbalanced experience. But even worse, the fulcrum joint isn't stiff enough to hold the weight of the batteries so it sinks while you read!!!!! Horrible. I'll give it two stars instead of one because it's bright. Bad product..."
1,It does not work,After I put battery cover on the light would not turn on. It will only work without the cover.
1,It didn't work,We were unable to get it to work for longer than a second. I think there's an issue with the way the batteries are supposed to be installed.
4,JORDAN CROSSING,"Tina Helmuth does a masterful job of weaving Biblical facts into JORDAN CROSSING. She has created an interesting, fast-paced novel that is well worth the reading!"
3,Not a bad light,"The two major downsides to this light are the thickness (unfortunately, it is a little thick) and the fact that it's fairly easy to accidentally turn it on if you keep it in your wallet."
3,eon stainless steel card lite,"Very nice, sleek in design. howev er it is difficult to find the pushbutton to turn the lite on. Overall great product."
1,Piece of junk.,"The product broke on its very first use. It unwound to the end and the mechanism that holds the tape for re-coiling snapped. We didn't put any undue force on it, either. It just snapped, or more probably was broken on arrival."
1,Third Symphony is incomplete,"I had to return this CD. The finale of the 3rd ends before the music actually ends. Like many popular songs, the music just fades away. Since this is the only Brahms orchestral work with a soft ending, that is a disaster. Whatever you do, do not buy this CD. For double the money, you can get all the Brahms symphonies in a twofer with a famous orchestra and conductor."
3,Radiographic Imaging,"Book is pretty good, I didn't use it much for part one of my image formation class. However, I am getting ready to take part two and it may be more useful. It will assist you in understanding the material."
3,nothing fantastic,"these replaced a bubble-foil type of shade that fell apart after several years.Works *ok*. If it is 100 degrees outside, then with the shades on it's 110-112 inside.Without the shade it's 120 inside. Eh, not a huge difference. Works about the sameas my old shade, though. Mostly, the steering wheel is not scalding hot and that's the onlyreal reason I use the shade. Just *barely* fits a 2009 Mazda5 if you turn the shades upside down andget the JUMBO."
3,Sun Shade,Both wings of the shade are not connected together which is not apparent in the picture or the ad. Being connected together makes it easier to place the shade on the dash. Not being connected together is not as convenient.The shade is easy to fold down and small enough to slip between the seat and console - very handy.
1,Altus Platinum Magic Shade,The Altus Platinum shade quality is flimsly and mostD I S A P P O I N T I N G In comparison to the 1998 Altima Shade I bought and used for as long as I can remember. I will not buy any more of the Altus Platinum Shades for the second reason - the first that you cannot fit a 2008 Quest Van. I havea used your plat. product for years. The new is just flimsy.Marla Kay Prenovost 928-536-4550
4,Good workable shades - here are the measurements,"Just got these shades and they work fine for our Honda Civic '02 and Saturn '95 - they're a bit smaller than we thought they'd be, but we just use the visors to hold the shades in place and they are fine (and make a huge difference in car temperature). The back of the package lists all the cars it fits - too many to list here but here are the measurements: Standard shades are 25 x 28, Jumbo shades are 28 x 31."
5,"Easy to use, does the job, lasts for many years","I have had one of these for about 4 years and it works great. My wife used accordion ones, which are bulky and wilt, and so she barely used it. She got a new car and finally noticed how well these ""magic shades"" work on my car, so I am ordering one for her.Some people have trouble folding them. It is easy: grab the upper left and bottom right corner (any two diagonal corners) and twist. When you twist, they form 3 smaller circles. You then push them together and it forms a single stable circle.They are small enough you can put them under your seat or next to the seat."
4,Good Item for the Price,"These sunshades do the trick. You'll get two separate shades, each designed to cover half the windshield. Folding these up is a bit of a trick, but I finally mastered it after a few tries."
3,OK - but doesn't give full coverage,"I measured my windshield before ordering and ordered the size based on measurements. However, the sunshade doesn't cover as much as I expected - there are gaps at the corners and between the two pieces in the bottom center due to the rounded corners of the shades. The material is also very thin and doesn't block light (and therefore heat) very well. I have subsequently ordered a one piece rollup Heatshield custom fit shade which I received a couple of days ago and it fills the windshield perfectly and it doesn't let any light through so the car interior is darker and cooler."
5,Works great ... just what I was looking for.,"I thought about buying a custom fit shade for my 2002 Subaru Impreza but I couldn't justify the cost. Also, I don't like having to rollup and tie a shade. I've owned a magic shade (different brand) before and it lasted 8 years of constant use. They're quick and easy to open/close when you get the hang of the fold like a taco and twist motion so I decided to give this one a shot. The item is too short if you try to place them like they are in the picture. I actually open them up vertically (w/the blackest part at the bottom of my windshield) and they fit fine. I'll cross my fingers that this one will last 8 years too."
3,A little relief from extra hot days,"I drive a black car with a black leather interior, and my parking spot has no shade during the day. It was often unbearable to get into my vehicle after 8 hours in the sweltering sun, so I needed to get something to help. I like that these fold up into compact circles for easy storage when not being used. These help a little bit with the temp, maybe lowers it about 5=8 degrees, but I am certain it would be worse without them. It may not be a very noticeable difference, but it is better than nothing."
5,Very good sun shade for large truck,These are the only sun shades I have found that fit nicely and completely shield my windshield on GMC Sierra truck. Work well and I am pleased with results. Excellent price.
4,Easy to Use,"I bought these for the car to use at dog trials, and they are easily to pop up and fold back, making them a nice item to keep in the car and store."
3,Easy to fold,My original reluctance was the difficultly to fold and store... That's a snap. Now the issue is that I want to move it to my VAN and Jumbo is not big enough for the windshield. Do they have SUPER Jumbo?I like this product.
4,Doesn't properly fit the windscreen.,It's easy to use and conveniently folds away. Unfortunately it doesn't cover or fit the windscreen properly and I have a small hatchback. But it does reflect the heat and there is a noted difference in temperature within the car.
4,"Works Well, Runs ""Small""","The Altus Platinum sunshades are definitely helping to keep my Honda Civic cooler this torrid summer. The shades are lightweight. And the price can't be beat. That said, there are modest gaps in coverage even with the Jumbo size as earlier reviewers have noted. I'm also finding it difficult to fold the shades. The bottom line though is that I glad I bought them."
5,Nice and large,"Fold easy, light weight, store small, open easy, very large for large windshields.No bad points to mention so far - only had them a week."
5,Perfect,"Good quality, a lot better than the one-piece folding one I bought from wal mart for $20. Fits vertically on my new 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid, a good fit, not too small, not too big. I did buy the large size. People....read the directions on HOW TO FOLD...its quite simple once you figure out where the 2 corners are where you gotta put ur thumbs at. I fold both pieces together....in like less than 3 secs. Perfect....especially the price...lol"
3,"Good quality, did not fit my 2008 Honda Civic","Pros:-Fold up easily when you follow the instructions.-Good quality. Sturdy vinyl/canvas material. Silver paneling helps repel sun.Cons:-Too small for my 2008 Honda Civic. Even when I try to hold them in place by lowering the car's visors, they still slip out and there is too much of a gap between the two shades to keep sun from filtering in and heating up the car. I had a similar set for a 1995 Honda Civic that fit fine, so my guess is these work well for older models, but the windshield (at least for Civics) has been redesigned as to make these particular magic shades too small."
2,Too small,"I got the standard size for a Ford Focus -- they are too small no matter how you place them. They barely cover the windshield -- there are gaps several inches wide. Worst, they do not stay up -- they are too short for the window visors to hold them up. Moral: get the Jumbo if you have a small car. Don't get any if you have a large car. -- or prepare to jerry-rig with clothespins."
3,Helps a Little,"I purchased the Jumbo size, thanks to the image another user uploaded, for my Honda Accord. Unfortunately, these STILL aren't quite large enough to hold themselves up in my windshield. However, I am able to jerryrig a system that allows them to stay up throughout the day.Unfortunately, these don't keep the ""heat out"" too well. There is still a noticeable heat between the outside air and inside air, even with my windows cracked. They do make it bearable for me to touch my drivers wheel and sit on my leather seats, though."
3,...it will do.,"I've had my Magic Shade for my other vehicle for years and its still going strong. This product has the same feel to it but, unfortunately, the shade is a little smaller than the windshield on my other car. So the tops do not quite fit and tend to fall. The sun visor on both the driver and passenger side need to be open to hold the shade in place."
3,Altus Platinum Magic Shade Jumbo Sunshade,"I bought this because it folds up, and takes less room than the shade screen I bought from Honda, for my Honda Fit. This says Jumbo, so I figured it would work fine, but it's too small. Didn't even come up to the sun-visor. I gave it to my daughter though, so it didn't go to waste, but still wish I could find one, this style, for my car. Took a while to get the knack of folding it, but after a few trys, it worked fine."
2,"If it had actually fit, I would like it","According to the size list on the back this should fit my car. But it doesn't. It states right on there it will fit the windshield of a hyundai tuscon, but it is about 4 inches too short to reach the top of the windshield. It is too short for the visors to keep them in place. And the only super jumbo sunshield in the world seems to be for sale through amazon only and they are OUT OF STOCK and don't know when will be back. I cannot find the super jumbo ANYWHERE! I am really upset as it says it should fit, and it doesn't and now i have to return it and try to find the super jumbo somewhere....anywhere.I am mad."
1,Poor design,The heat sensor on this thermometer is set too high. I have to tip the pan so the syrup will reach it and I don't think I'm getting an accurate reading. As you candy makers know it's important not to disturb the syrup. I plan on getting a different thermometer for candy making. I'm sure it will work fine for frying but that's not what I got it for.
1,Near worthless for candy,"This thermometer gives completely inaccurate readings unless you have at least the first 1.5 inches in the food. If any part of that sensor area is exposed to air, the reading will be way low.So, if you're using it for something like peanut brittle or fudge, chances are, your boiling liquids won't be deep enough to get accurate readings.However, it's a fairly sturdy device and reads very quickly so would probably be great for deep fat frying and meats."
3,Not a perfect solution but it works.,I installed this in our boat cover. The quality is not the best but it does work. One problem is it is inside the cover when I roll it up so I have to be careful of it. The pieces snap together and they tend to come apart. It finally broke but in a way that I can still use it. The overall idea is good. I just wish the quality was better.
3,Boat Vent for Boat Covers,"Cheaply made, they cost alot for what you get. The built in fan will work for a very short time then all you have is the plain ole' vent (which they cost so much less) So really, I wouldn't waste your money, just purchase a regular boat canvas vent."
1,Bad experience with this product,"Wiring is cheap and the solar cap comes off easily. I think I've tried two or three of these and never made it past the install - never got one to work. The concept is good, it's just that from my observations, the product is not well made."
3,its OK,"Its ok and very fun. the most ugly thing that there is no paint. Instead, my son use markers. it looked great! Almost like the revell 1/1200 Titanic. This has the bulkheads too tall and water wont flood through the entire ship, so he open the first hole at the bottom and the second hole blocked with tape. Very fun."
5,Through Death to Life by Ron Gries,"This is the first grief book that I have read from a male perspective - what a joy to read it! It is the story of an unbelievably difficult journey for both patient (Patty) and caregiver (Ron). As someone who has suffered two recent losses - and also someone who helps to facilitate Grief Recovery classes, I found myself deeply helped by his sharing. I also have marked several pages to read at my next Grief Recovery class."
4,Interesting Historical Perspective,"This book offers an amazing look at California through a totally different lens of gender and sexuality.I was born and raised in California and am now a fourth grade teacher in California where I teach California state history.As a California native, I found this book gave me many interesting details about how I ended up here. As a teacher, I found this book gave me a wider perspective as to what really has happened here in the Golden State."
5,"a must read for the everyday ""athlete""","If you're breathing then this book is for YOU!!!! Such a clever, fun way to look at excercising that isn't really a ""workout"". A great gift for anyone athlete or potatoe...anyone can benefit from learning how to stretch, strengthen and just feel better.I LOVED this book and the proceeds go to a great cause 100%!!!! Awesome."
3,A little lacking,"Conquest is the 7th book in the New Jedi Order series, and it pictures the adventure from Anakin Solo's eyes. The book uses a lot of characters from the Young Jedi Knights series, which many have probably never read. These characters can often be confusing to those unfamiliar with them. The story of the Yuuzhan Vong slave is very interesting, as is the story of the Shapers. Both of these side stories offer new insight into the Yuuzhan Vong mindset, and how they view the universe."
4,There was no Conquest,"Not much happens in Conquest on a galactic scale. There is no ""Conquest"" by anyone at all really. This book pretty much just follows Anakin as he launches a rescue after the Yuuzhan Vong capture the Jedi Academy. This was much slower that the other 5 books, but after I got used to the pace it was pretty good. Some important interactions begin to take place between Anakin and the Vong and Anakin can almost feel them in the force now. One funny note: I was a bit annoyed at some scenes where the Senate seems content to make deals with the Vong and pretend that they are not bent on capturing the entire galaxy. What I was annoyed about is that I couldn't conceive of anyone being so stupid as to believe the Vong's lies, frankly I couldn't suspend disbelief enough at the fiction of it."
2,????,I got this book bedfore I even new about this series so I didn't undetstand didly squat so I read the first one after reading thios one and could barly understand anything anyways.I think this seires is just made for confusion.
4,"More like 3, but...","This book does show promise, no longer are the jedi just indiscriminatly getting their butts kicked. The Yanmon Vog are starting to show there weak spots and it is now plain that they can be beaten. I intend to keep up with this serise."
1,Ugh!,"Conquest is an encapsulated version of the reasons why the NJO is such a lousy series. It's a cross between the Young Jedi Knights kids series (Anakin and his pals) and sub-par Trek (the Borg, er, Vong). The publisher is really scraping bottom when it serves this juvenile swill up as a mainstream SW novel. Strictly for twelve-year-olds."
4,NJO finally shines.,"This book is simply amazing, and is the best NJO book written thus far. Keyes shows here that he doesn't need to have five different plotlines in order to give a story momentum. Instead, the focus is on Anakin's race to save his best freind, Tahiri, a student at the Jedi Academy, from being turned into a Yuzzhan Vong. The plot might be predictable, but the characters are the true centerpoint of the novel. Keyes is the first NJO author to actually bring character depth to the Yuzzhan Vong. While the beginning starts off a little shaky, in the end, this book will leave readers deeply satisfied."
4,Wish they were all like this.,"I bought this book today and devoured it this afternoon. I have read all of the books in this series and this one seems to me to be the most fun of all of them. Anakin is at his best and is continuing to mature along the lines that Mara Jade Skywalker encouraged him in earlier books. In this installment, he rediscovers his connection to Tahiri that he left behind when he became a Jedi Knight--and is stronger for it. The ending also presents some of the first hopeful signs that all may not be lost in the battle against the Yuuzhan Vong. All in all, a most enjoyable book."
5,Best Yet,This is definetly the best book yet in the New order series. Anakin is a power to be reconed with. I liked the Vong character in this one also. I hope that Anakin does not fall to the dark side as he can be a great character to build the future around. I cannot wait for #2. I have it on order already.
5,Best new jedi order release,"I have read pretty much everything in the star wars saga, from zahn to the new jedi order and i am extremely pleased with this latest release. It's argueably the best new jedi order i've read and one of my all time favourites!I highly recommend all starwars fans to read these book cause they are great and they keep getting better the further the story goes."
4,"No such thing as absolute, pure evil","If there is one thing ""The New Jedi Order"" series lacked, it's good villains. The novelty of the Yuuzhan Vong and their philosophy wore off after the first couple of books. We were left with pure evil villains, too one-dimensional and abstract to be interesting.This book is the first to explore the Vong society in more depth and detail. It adds new dimensions to the race (there are - gasp - dissenters and outcasts) and makes them more believable. Maybe it's just me, but the ""Jedi Order"" universe seems a lot more exciting for it.After a somewhat slow start, the action picks up and stays fast enough to satisfy all but the utterly addicted through the rest of the book. The relationship (and dialogue) between Anakin and Vua the Vong warrior is a highlight. A satisfying addition to the series."
3,"Anakin is weakly written, a childs book","As a reader of all the Star Wars novels, except the juvinile young Jedi series, I must say I am diddapointed. While the Vong are superbly written, and we learn more in this book then in all the others it isn't enough to overcome the books basic flaw; Anikin is a boring character. He has none of the depth and internal strife that Jacen stuffers nor any of the supreme compitence of Jaina. Anakin is writinas a spoiled jedi adept who just gets lucky, we don't see any hard sacrifice or internal struggle that a coming of age story would have. When compared with the work of Micheal Stackpole (whose I, Jedi is the best Star Wars book of all time). IT is made all the worse in that Keyes had a chance to introduce the Corran Horn character and he didn't. There was no supporting cast, although the one chapter with Luke showed the possablities for a new aspect in his character.I say don't read it unless you've read the others and need continuity."
2,Boring but Necessary,"This book was probably one of the worst Star Wars novels that i have read. The action was very slow and i had a hard time keeping interested in it. This book is necessary to read because it does give you information about the Vong, but it was terrible to read. The other characters are all but forgotten. The only characters that matter are Anakin and Tahiri. These two should really have been kept in the junior jedi knight series. There is very little about the other characters, including Luke and Mara. At a time as critical as this, there really should be more of a plot that involves luke and mara.Anyhow, to finish this up, this book is very slow, but in order to keep reading the series, it really should be read"
5,Great Purchase!,"I got my first one 3 or 4 years ago for my ferrets and it is still working great! I just bought another as I am getting rats. As mentioned it leaks some, but I have never had one that didn't.The duck is great for telling where the water level is from a distance.It is made of hard plastic which discourages chewing and it is easy to take in and out of the clip."
1,Hamster hated the consequences,"Despite the warnings mentioned on other reviews about the leakage issue we believe in the product line and purchased the 8 ounce version as a dual source for our small cage. To our regret we found that it was too big to fit inside the cage and our only choice was to replace 4 ounce bottle that came with the cage. Despite our belief that the occasional drops were tolerable, the 8 ounces of water dribbled out overnight. The hamster had a fit and tossed the wet bedding out of her cage throughout the room. Our goal of insuring she would always have a water supply was defeated, we had a mess to clean up and we are back to our original bottle. AVOID this product despite it's greatintentions."
1,Defective item,My bottle would not hold water at all. The whole thing emptied within minutes. The drinking tube will not even orient the correct way. Returning
1,LEAKS LEAKS AND LEAKS,"This bottle just leaks until empty, soaks the whole cage. I have had it for a while, and no matter how i fill it, or attach it, it just drips and drips. Worst product ever!!"
1,Kept leaking!,"This bottle kept leaking. It soaked my bedding for my rabbit cage. At first, it leaked continuously like a stream. After a while, it leaked drops of water which soaked my bedding. I am very disappointed with this product. The bottle I got from a petsmart was cheaper and it didnt leaked at all. Waste of money."
4,Finally something they won't chew through...,"The heavier plastic than most bottle has discouraged my rats from chewing through it--and the larger size helps ensure that if I can't refill it every day, they won't have any need to chew through it anyways. The floating duck makes it easy to tell what the water level is from across the room as well. Also the holder, though a little difficult to adjust, makes it very easy to pull the bottle off for refills. Initially I had some problems with drips, but I think the large size needs more of a squeeze for the vacuum to seal. Still, that's a minor beef."
1,Junk Find something else!,This bottle drips / leaks. It is poorly made. It is low quality. I don't like the attachment design. Don't waste your money. There are many better options on Amazon.
1,"Air bubble gets stuck in tube, prevents water from flowing","I have this bottle in a cage for 2 small rats I've been watching for my neice before Christmas. After a couple days I noticed they were aggressively drinking from the bottle and I didn't think much of it. I soon noticed that the little floating ducky hadn't gone down at all! I took the bottle out and found that a large air bubble had collected at the nozzle and was blocking any water from going down. I gave it shake to loosen the air bubble and everything seemed fine...until all the water in the nozzle was gone and another air bubble had built up again. This happened over and over. I don't see anything wrong with the bottle, it simply appears to be a design flaw."
3,"OK, not great","The product basically does what it promises;however, I have not found it very useful nor has it made any difference in my golf swing."
3,The legitimate reference for Oracle begineers and Masters.,"FDS, Oracle Programming 8.0, Oracle 8i is the state of the art book after Elmasari & Navathe's ""Fundamentals of Database System"" which helps to build up and groom your DATABASE Concepts. By Fundamentals Database Systems, Oracle Programming 8.0, Oracle 8i, one can orient and get the confidence to work with one of the most successful DBMS--Oracle 8i which is going with same pace of Internet Development."
2,Not a quality producf,"Had to return our first shipment as the black insert inside of the case was broken. Our sencond one wasn't broken, but looked and felt like it could go in any minute. Very cheap plasic with black felt glued on, which is rubbing off on the chips and cards making a mess.Try a different brand or save some hassle and buy locally so you can return it easier if it breaks."
4,Good Expansion,"This game is a good expansion for the Settler's of Catan game, but note it is only an expansion. I think that the Catan series is a great one however I think that the Cites and Knights is better than this one. Note: I play both and enjoy both, i would just suggest the Cites and Knights expansion over this one if you are loking looking to get one of the two."
1,doo doo at its worst!,"If you happen to come across this abhorrent piece of trash in the rental store,run,do not walk. The only horror involved here is that this movie was even made. The acting was the worst I have seen in recent memory,the special effects look like someone ravaged a butcher shop dumpster,and there is no plot at all. A completely worthless hack film. I wouldnt have given this crap one star if there was a zero available."
1,night of the dreadful,"Anyone who plans on renting this movie....DON'T DO IT! I beg you please! It comes off as a Re-Aminator but its not.The acting is painfull and where did the director find that woman.Its pathetic! Hey I love campy movies but this thing is just stupid.Its bad when the only good actress is about 5 years old.I maybe a little harsh on this thing but perhaps I'll take a shot of novicane and try it again.A quick synopsis,A lab dude finds a way to reincarnate dead tissue back to life.Zombies walk around killing people.HO-HUM.Throw it in the trash man."
2,Fast ship,Not a good movie and I like almost all zombie related things. I would not watch this again and hope I lose it.
2,D-rated zombie movie,"This is so bad that that, even though I have not finished watching it, I am already writing a review. A doctor that uses Faberware scissors to open up patients, and uses a pump for a blood transfusion?! They didn't even get the color of frog's blood right! I'll admit to something. This movie is better than other zombie movies (Zombie Nationcomes to mind). For a low budget zombie movie, it was ok. If you watch this movie, which I hope you don't, you will somewhat enjoy the movie once the zombies overrun the hospital. I guess the biggest fault of this movie, aside from the pathetic acting, is the beginning of the film and the lack of good props. The zombies are not that bad, except when they talk, and then it all goes down the drain. Zombies should not talk, they should eat and that's it. But, in this film the doctor's wife has quite the long dialogue, and that is annoying."
1,Night to forget Forever!!!,"Okay let start off by saying they use every knock off to promote this horrible movie. First the title then the whole plot of the movie is like Re-animator but a bad knock of the greatness of Re-Animator. It starts with a doctor bringing a dead frog back to life then it goes crazy so he kills it. This is how it starts really dumb not even funny. ThenHis wife and daughter dies and you know the rest of the story. This movie was painful to watch. Bad acting,bad script, and terrible effects. This movie offers nothing on all levels. I rented this trash and feel so rip off. Do youerself a favor and PASS on this terd bomb!! You will be a better person for it."
5,An excellent how-to book,"If like me, you are a young mom trying to encourage your child's creativity to blossom, or even a preschool teacher, then this is definitely a worthwhile read...it comes with helpful strategies, and useful tips on how to promote creativity in young kids...and some ideas are common sense, but its upon reading the book that you really begin to see how other useful ideas might be implemented."
4,Good Book,"Like other reviewers have said, the author does go on about mistakes parents make. Some of them are pretty bad so I understand. But this book has some really good exercises."
5,Awesome Light!!,"This light is so bright! Not only is it small and fits into your pocket, it has helped us so much with reading small print!! If you have elderly parents or grandparents, this is a MUST!! I am ordering more.....a great gift!!"
3,too little in size and light source,"great idea, but it is so little that it is VERY easy to misplace, and the light source is also very little."
2,Once the only translation; since then has been superceded.,The newer translation by Robert Hullot-Kentor is more comprehensible (to a non-German speaker) than this version. This was the only widely-available translation until recently.
5,An accurate insight and timely call,"I saw this book out of the corner of my eye as I was rushing through the church bookstore on my way home from yet another sunday service. It caught my attention, and even though I had been on many short term mission trips to China before (and thus had a sound knowledge of modern day China), I was compelled to buy this book and read it.I'm certainly glad that I did. This book provides a balanced and in-depth view of China and Christianity today. It answers the questions many of us have about modern-day China and the role we have to play in it's future.Don't read this book expecting your life to be the same afterwards. You will be challenged to the core. You will find yourself called to live a life of action - a life of passion.The continuing heartcry for China goes on... Can you hear the call?"
1,Easily the worst Warhammer books in existence.,"I've read many, many Warhammer novels; 40k and Fantasy. I never really came across one that made me groan out loud at the author's ""style"". The author is never really quite clear at times who's thoughts you are reading, whether it is a first or third person narration. At times it seems like the author just ran out of things to type so he added the words ""Oh, yes blah blah blah."" and ""Oh, no they wouldn't blah blah blah."" I am not exaggerating in the slightest. This series should have a career in MMA. About half way through the third novel I had to tap out. I just couldn't take the characters' lack of distinguishing personality besides the use of catch phrases. I could handle the meandering narration or even the pubescent crushes the main characters had for a particular character. It also reads like the author was trying to squeeze every type of encounter possible to give his novels substance and legitimacy."
1,Don't bother.,"I really like the Warhammer 40k universe, and this book does it a terrible injustice. I read the combined trilogy with the short story links inbetween, and by the end, I just had to haul myself to the next page. The ending is absurd. There is no other word for it. The amount of non-cannon material is staggering. Not that you shouldn't be able to make stuff up in a fantasy world, but when you're working with an existing universe, you have to keep the basics in line, this book is way off on a tangent with those basics. I had no sympathy for any of the characters really, but least of all for the star! Motivations were mostly non-sensical, plot lines wander all over the place, I could go on and on.I have read a huge amount of books over the years, from classics to pulp and everything inbetween, and this is the worst book I have ever read out of all of them."
1,Terrible writing,"I have read more than a dozen omnibus books on warhammer and 40K warhammer, This had to be the worse book ever written. Ian Watson loves to hear himself talk and talk and talk. After fighting through the book to see what, if anything would actually happen at the end, I found the worse ending I have ever read. A true piece of garbage. Ian Watson should never write a book again in the 40K series. There really isn't much to say more, I would just be copying this sorry author. This book is a total waste of anyone's time."
2,Too Much Exposition,"An interesting read if for nothing more than to see how ""old school"" Black Library authors wrote, and for a bit of canon.That said, I found Watson's writing style to be too florid and meandering for this sort of story. A paragraph of plot/action, then two paragraphs of exposition on some aspect of the preceding paragraph, then he's off on a tangent about that.Draco and Harlequin were the best two of the three, with Chaos Child bringing up a very distant rear. The plot finale was weak/lame and, as is the case with most current Black Library authors, very little resolution to follow it.I didn't rip through this trilogy like I have some others (Space Wolves, Eisenhorn, etc.), and I won't be picking it up again anytime soon."
5,Love him or hate him...,"Love him or hate him, you have to admit Ian Watson's genius and his testicular fortitude. This novel was not written in current 40k standard and I dearly wish Black Library would throw out more of its type. It is one of the most gruesome titles ever produced (the worst being Space Marine by the self-same author), yet at the same time it is the most compelling.I must say, the last novel seems to be a huge letdown until you finally get the great cosmic joke that Ian Watson has played in it. Mini-spoiler alert: It is a love story; not a war story. I can only admire the courage it takes to do something like that and find it a bit refreshing that an author would go so far as to write about an actual human being as opposed to a meat marionette whose goals are entirely one-dimensional."
3,OK Construction,"I installed these wires on my '98 Corolla last year. They fit fine and work, but the wire insulation is not molded or secured to either end. Gaps can form easily if you're not careful to push the insulation back in place. In general, this set just feels flimsy, especially compared to the OEM wires. Truth be told, I bought it for the Bosch name and the ""Premium"" on the package but there is definitely nothing premium about the product.--UPDATE--After reading a couple of other reviews for this, I want to emphasize that this spark plug wire set fits and works fine. It is just that I replaced them with NGK spark plug wires (the blue ones) and I think there is a big difference in quality. I also tried different types of spark plugs through the years but finally went back to the original DENSO ones. I realize I should have stuck with Toyota's recommendations all along for NGK and DENSO parts. They cost more but I do think they make the car run almost like it did when I purchased it new."
2,Disappointing and unbalanced,"What am I missing here? Philip includes contemporary American male poets such as J. Patrick Lewis, Douglas Florian and Paul Fleischman but excludes award-winning female poets such as Lilian Moore, Alice Schertle, Constance Levy, Deborah Chandra and Barbara Juster Esbensen to name only a few. Take a look--this anthology is tipped heavily toward male poets to the detriment of the book's value to a serious reader."
2,a tribal assault--with a touch of hardhouse,"Don't expect vocal anthems here. this is all beats and sounds, with an occasional vocal thrown in. This is actually more interesting tribal, slightly aggressive, more appealing than some of the real repetitive stuff, but it's still not my thing--the remix of Marc et Claude's Lovin You isn't so bad. Good number of long versions, though. Track times:1. jiu-jitsu-emotional (7:37)2. memories of ocean drive (6:34)3. superconscious (7:03)4. skindeep (6:17)5. alma (6:52)6. get my love (8:53)7. echoes (8:44)8. first tribal feeling (5:16)9. chemical attraction (5:14)10. loving you (5:56)"
5,Bullet proof,"Great product, so far. This is not an after work project, you will want to dedicate a whole day to do the job correctly. You will also want to paint the tank afterwards as it can get a little messy. Unfortunately my tank is powdercoated and I had to seal the tank after coating because I didn't know if the sealer would stand up to the oven now I have a few silver fingerprints on the tank. This stuff tracks like never-sieze but becomes permanent. All three products work as advertised. My tank sat since 1977 and now the inside looks as good as new. And of course dealing through Amazon, for me, has always gone smooth."
2,Only lines tank. Does not seal holes.,"I was quite disappointed with this system. It seems it only lines the tank to prevent future rust. It does no do very well sealing pin holes. It is too thin to seal holes. It comes with a piece of cloth to try to seal the outside of the tank anywhere there are pin holes. It did not seal the holes. It is just too thin. I followed the directions, but it did not perform to my expectations."
1,The Item Picture is MISLEADING,"I thought this thermometer was cool because of the temperature guide/label on the sheath.Also the metal clip.When I got the item, it came in a NASTY black cover with no label.This is going to be returned.CDN - Label your ad correctly please..."
2,i received the wrong thermometer,"i wanted this item because of the temperatures on the sheath, because i need them. the one i got does not have the temps written on it and also the nut to calibrate the thermometer wont budge at all. im expecting my money back or the correct item."
2,could be better,"Love the way this brush brushes, but . . . the wood finish has peeled off--started to lose its finish within the first few months I owned it. Willing to pay more if I can find one that works as well as this one did."
4,boar bristle brush,Not as many bristles as the one I had and thought I was replacing but not a bad substitute for the price.
3,too much nylon in the bristles for my tastes,"Just a note that there are lots of nylon posts in the bristles and those posts aren't exactly smooth. If you have lots and lots of hair, I can see this being a plus, but if you have thinning hair of any kind, I'd avoid this brush and stick with one having 100% bristles."
3,"Purchased this brush to replace my sephora boar brush that was peeling after a years use. However,","Brush works fine, however, the varnish has flaked off after only a month of use. I purchased this brush to replace a plastic coated boar brush from Sephora that flaked after a whole year of heavy use. Won't buy again."
3,Disappointed,"My daughter loves the way this brush works in her thick hair, but the finish is quickly peeling away. I bought the wood handle intentionally to use a natural material. Next time, I may try plastic."
2,worked great. until it broke.,"It worked great. Until it broke. It fell into the tea kettle while I was boiling water and it stopped working. Sure... maybe it's not meant to be boiled... but considering what it's designed to do, one would think it could survive 185 degree temps for 5 seconds (that's how long it took to fish it out)! I'd imagine if the seal around the thermometer's face was better, it'd be fine. But, it's not. The word ""disposable"" comes to mind regarding all these cheap thermometers."
4,Deep characters with unusual backgrounds,"The cover of this book put me off at first, but after reading the first three pages I decided to buy it. I'm so glad I did.There's a lot to like about this story. For starters, the perfect man--intelligent, strong, and sexy; Regency-era card games that get pretty risque; and a noble heroine you can really sympathize with. Grace is an excellent combination of proud, sensible and vulnerable.The heroine is a compassionate soul with an intelligent and rational approach to everything, although her actions on behalf of another abused woman seem like complete folly at times, she's determined not to see another woman suffer the way she had.Gail Ranstrom writes an excellent story with lots of historical background. Her chapters flow, building a multi-layered story with a plot that really comes together. The story was adventurous and exciting and very, very believable.I think this author is someone to read and watch."
4,this guy on front cover.....,"the man on front cover is John Gidding, HGTV host of Curb Appeal, John is good looking in person than his romantical covers!"
4,"For the genre, a solid 4 stars","Like the previous reviewer said, the cover is a little off-putting. Don't let that turn you away. For a historical romance, this really is a solid 4 stars.The H & h are both likable people. Grace has managed to survive a rough life with her compassion and good character intact, but here we get to see her come into her own in a whole new way. Adam is wounded and driven but not to an unrealistic degree.The interaction between the two is very believable. There is much that they withhold from each other, but they don't lie, and they even admit that they aren't telling everything - so it manages to come together as a good read, avoiding slipping into 'big misunderstanding' territory, thank goodness!"
2,The tried and tested M&B formula at work.,"Honestly, what were the two previous reviewers thinking?Fortunately I loaned this from my local library.What can I say?ProsThe plot around the hero Adam turning up was good. I found that part of the book enjoyable - this I admit.Cons1. Laura's brother abused her physically yet she didn't want to marry Lord G because of his gambling. Eh?2. Why did Grace keep on going to the 'hells' even when she found out the reason why Laura was against marrying Lord G (apart from the gambling)?3. Why did Lord G ask Adam to be his second in a duel - this made no sense.4. How did Grace think SHE could prove Lord G was cheating?5. Why didn't Grace insist on seeing the will?This book has a heroine with quite a few TSTL moments that made me what to swear at her lol!Give this one a miss."
5,fixed,"this is the item I need to fix my broken garage door, saved me hundred. It is working for more than half year now and no problem. will recommend to friend."
5,The Abhorsen Trilogy,"This is an adventure that will keep you on your toes. You never know what will happen. Garth Nix develops the characters in detail and describes so well that you can almost feel what the characters are going through. It is a well balanced series that contains just the right amount of adventure, magic, and suspense."
5,Jack Teagarden,"Beautiful old recordings I did not even know that they existed. Recorded from 1930 to 1950, they knew their music"
5,simply the best!,"Falk manufactures all the stainless-clad copper cookware on the market today (including the copper vessels for mauviel). this pan is the thicker of the two sizes (2.0mm and 2.5mm), but one would be hard pressed to notice a difference between the two. the point is, this piece is solid copper. only downside is that it does not have the rolled pouring edge. falk, and mauviel's other (2.0mm thick) cooking line have this, and it has its advantages. these pans are quite heavy, but it gives a sense that these will last many generations."
2,disappoointment,"I had one of these lights for 10 yrs with no problem but unfortunately stepped on it. So I ordered a new one which very frequently would not turn on. Amazon kindly replaced it but alongwith that continued but less frequent problem, now only half the light goes on every other time. UNfortunatley there company is Japanese so can't communicate with them. Givingup withthis light unfortunatgley."
5,None better,I have 4 of them;have had them for years and they all work perfectly. Makes reading at night a pleasure and as a result I have increased my reading time significantly.Great to travel with-you can't always count on good light in hotel rooms.
4,The Ghost of Book Light Present,"First off - great book light. Perfect brightness and coverage (comparatively speaking, of course). However, in sympatico with other comments regarding the faulty ""on"" switch, I feel I must reveal an even more disturbing experience with my Light Voyager. Since purchase, I have been battling the supernatural forces which reside inside this light. When it is pitch black in my bedroom and I try to turn on the book light - nothing happens; no matter how long I leave the switch on. That is, until I turn on another light source - at which point the book light immediately fires right up. It's as if the fluorescent bulbs are actually FEEDING upon an outside light source to power themselves up. And this happens like clockwork. Daytime and dusk - it turns on with no problem. But in the thick of night, it plays dead until you flick on another light and then it instantly comes to life. Sort of like a cold cathode vampire.I've been sleeping with one eye open ever since."
2,Fantastic light...when it works,"The Phorm does provide an excellent, bright light over a wide area...when it works. More often than not, however, the light does NOT turn on without fiddling with the on/off switch, the batteries, and/or the lamp head. And it's not a case of weak batteries--this happens with newly recharged ones and new alkaline batteries, too. Too bad--it's otherwise a wonderful book light."
3,Phorm book light,"I do a lot of reading & own several book lights including the Light Wedge, Mighty Bright, and Phorm. The Phorm book light has a unique style and it looks like a great product - unfortunately, it worked for the first 10 minutes I got it and then the light went out. I changed the batteries, but it still didn't work. I had to send it back to a service center - it took about 1 1/2 months to get it back. It works now, but the down side to this light is that you can't adjust the light over the area that you're reading. My favorite is still the Mighty Bright."
2,too bulky,Maybe better for hardback but it's too bulky and heavy for paperbacks if you are holding the book up. Mighty bright light was smaller and more practical.
2,A good concept with weak execution,"The strength and weakness of this reading light is the florescent bulb. It provides for adequate light and good battery life. Although the light is heavy to clip onto a book and nearly inpossible for a magazine, its pivoting light makes it great for reading in bed. Just put the light on your chest and rotate the light to the book. However, the florescent light is a problem to turn on. Move the switch to ON and wait. Sometimes seconds, often minutes, I thought the problem was the switch, but it was my patience. I wasn's used to waiting minutes for the light to go on. And now, it's gone down to half power, even with a power cord. Unfortunately, its no longer bright enough to read by, so I'm looking for a replacement."
1,disappointment,Very disapointed in this booklight since if I used it 24 hours a day it would have lasted 1800 hours instead of the 10000 hours it guarantees. Since it probably was used a total 200 hours not only disapointing but a waste of money. Have found no resolution with Amazon.Or Phorm since there is no way to contact them.
4,Good Book Light,"This is my first book light. I like it for the most part. It is a little bit heavy for mass market paperbacks, especially the smaller ones, but that can be adjusted by clamping more pages in the back. I like having the light right on the pages. I have used in with my Bible and that worked better as it is bigger. All in all, I'm satisfied. I'll use it until it wears out before looking for another."
4,Pretty good light,"I have gone through several booklights in the past years and have really been happy with this one. I recently bought this item for work as I have a job where I sit in a darkened room all night caring for a pediatric patient. I needed a light that would help me do my paperwork and also be a good book light as I am reading 1-2 books nightly. When doing my paperwork, it easily sits without being clipped to anything. I like that this one has a adjustable head, it's bright enough to read by but doesn't wake anyone else in the room. I find it illuminates both pages with no problem. I also like the fact that you can buy an a/c adapter so you don't have to buy stock in battery companies. I actually haven't even put batteries in it yet as I only use it at work and have an outlet to use."
3,OK book light,"I like the brightness that has designed which is good for reading at night. However, I think it is little bit more heavier than I thought when it neeeds 4 AA batteries. Also, the light sometimes needs to wait for 5 seconds to be on that makes me think that it is out of order. Just need to be patience."
1,Unreliable.,"I have the black version of this light.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Regardless of any good qualities, if I can't get the light to turn on consistently, it's of no use. Please see the other reviews about this problem and avoid this light.Also, it's surprisingly bulky. I have another 4-AA book light that seems much less bulky."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book! It is wonderful to see both racial diversity and homosexuality explored in the same book - a rare thing indeed. It is important for children to see all people and see that families come in all forms and for children to learn to respect and appreciate this diverse world they will live in. Buy the book, your children will be richer for it!! I was atonished, as were others, to see the review posted by the woman who was upset by the content of the book. Clearly, she has taught her child to hate - as her child's comments suggested - and I'm not sure why she bought the book, also no parent ""owns children"" as she suggested. Anyhow, a great book all around and a wonderful opportunity to provide your child with a window into a world that may not (or may be) the same as his/her own."
1,it's not what it's cracked up to be,"the kitchen arrived just in time for the holidays and when it was opened, one of the doors had a giant crack in it. for 200 plus bucks, this should not happen."
3,Nice size but odd blue tint to light,"This light seems very well built and I admit that the light is bright. However, the light is also blue. I'm not sure why that is or if the black case version of this light has the same issue. You can see everything fine in the dark but it takes a moment to adjust to seeing everything in a blue tint.The size is great. It is a little thicker than a regular credit card. It would fit in your wallet but you would not want to do this as the pressure of the wallet would cause the switch that is on the flat surface to light up the light. Another issue for me is that the switch does not stay on unless you are pressing it. There are times when it is nice to turn a flashlight on and set it down so you can use both hands."
5,Great Fun!!!,"This is a wonderful book, a fun look at stuff I just didn't know!!!!Highly recomend it!!"
2,The next big punk band? Not really.,"I have heard about this band, and I was lucky enough to recieve this album for free from someone spreading the word about them. The band members say their biggest influence is Rancid, but this doesent really sound a whole lot like that. I do give the band Odd Man Out some credit though. Their budget isn't the biggest, and they are not even adults yet. Its kind of hard to really take them serious though, but at least they're not just whining about how life is so tough fot them and all that. Most of the lyrics are you're typical pop punk fare, but with more spark, and some of it more thought out. Odd Man Out still has alot more maturing to do, but at least its not as goofy as old Blink-182(a band I dislike) stuff. Non of the songs sound alike on here, which is a good thing, but I dont really enjoy them that much. This cd also needs better recording quality. I'm sure this band will appeal to some people, but it doesent appeal to me. Odd Man out arent a Rancid."
4,Obsession,This is my first time reading one of Patricia Ramsey's novels but it won't be the last. I really enjoyed the way the story flows and keeps you guessing through most of the book. I will definitely look for more of her novels.
3,In the process of reading on my Kindle.,Trying to mix romance with mystery and not doing a very good job. Having a hard time holding my interest.
5,Keeps your attention for hours!,"This was one of those great surprises in life. I had not read this author before, but I will certainly be looking for more from her. I found myself taking my Kindle to work just to sneak in a few more pages! A great mix of romance and suspense. Throw in a vampiric serial killer, tragic side-kick, two strong, independent leads with solid supporting cast, and you've got a story that will keep you trying to solve the mystery even in your sleep. Definitely a book to get you through a rainy weekend. Or, even a sunny one!"
1,I Don't Get It,"I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. I really wanted to like this book - I kept trying and trying until finally finished, but all it left me with was a feeling of 'thank heavens that's over'. The plot starts out with promise but somewhere along the long becomes almost left by the wayside - like it's getting in the way of the burgeoning relationship of Detective Cole Kincaid and Reporter Laurie. Which would be great if either of those characters were remotely interesting or likable. They're not. We never really know much about them to learn to like them. Even Cole's past is heaped on us in an apparent effort to give him some 'character' but it doesn't work for me. Just seems forced. For me, no character in this book was overly interesting or likable. The book wasn't the worst I've ever read but unless you're stuck with nothing left to read, I wouldn't recomment it. Sad because I really like to support my home state authors."
1,Sorry to say,"Wow - I read this book based upon the rave reviews it was given. I did read the whole book but it was difficult. The characters were hard to like and the dialog seemed forced. It seems that the same lines were used over and over. Cole's boss for instance continually refered to the murder as a ""piece of crap."" Who says that? Or during dialog I can't begin to tell you how many sentences start with the word ""Hell."" The story line was hard to believe and had many inconsistancies. Sorry but for me this book didn't work."
1,Big disappointment,"If you want to see the same scenes reused over and over across episodes, if you want to see coutless scenes of Stoneman taking pictures with his 35mm camera, if you don't want to learn anything about the ocean, names and behaviors of its creatures, then you won't mind watching this series."
4,"Give Us A DVD Of This, Please!","I believe ""neo-noir"" is what they call this genre of film, and it's a pretty good representation of it. Like other fans of this movie, I am still waiting for a DVD of ithe movie. Come on, man!Virginia Madsen plays a Marilyn Monroe-lookalike. Seeing her as blonde was odd, but I can't complain looking at her figure and her smile, which I've always thought was one of Hollywood's best. Meanwhile, Treat Williams is effective as the private eye. He looks the part.The music in here, featuring jazz trumpet, is great film noir stuff. My tape is wearing out, so let's please have a DVD released."
2,Failed within 1 month,I've been through numerous candy thermometers (I use them for deep frying) and still haven't found a solid performer. My logic with trying this one was back to basics...perhaps a simple bulb model would be best. The thermometer worked great the first 4-5 times I used it then when I removed it from hot oil the alcohol (or whatever is used in the bulb) separated and I was never able to get it back together so I had to throw the unit away. Perhaps there is something I could have done to prevent this but I still feel that it is a shortcoming of this type of thermometer and therefore would not recommend it.
1,"Numbers wore off quickly, making it useless","printed-on numbers that cook off into your fry grease or candy syrup, are a deal-breaker. I thought this one was the answer, and for a while it was fine, but once the printed-on numbers wore off, it became as useless as if it had broken. Sure, the stainless steel frame is great quality, and the glass is great too, even secured properly so the thermometer glass won't slide. But without any readable numbers, it's useless. Now I have to try to find another one, hopefully with numbers stamped into the metal such that even if the dark stuff wears off, I can still read the indented numbers. Here's hoping for a product that isn't designed to fail in short order, but I am beginning to fear there's no such thing anymore."
1,Need Lots of Oil,This is a great thermometer for deep frying with a lot of oil or making candy where the product is at least one inch or more.So my search goes on for a thermometer that will work on more shallow amounts of oil.
1,Ruined my caramel,My family bought me this thermometer for Christmas 2010. I make caramels every holiday season for friends and family. The first batch I made this season using this thermometer was ruined. Too hard. I tried a second batch using my old candy thermometer and the new one. Guess what? The CDN thermometer was off by 10 degrees! No wonder the caramel overcooked. I agree with the other reviewer that the design of this thermometer calls for lots of liquid and a straight-sided pan. Don't bother buying this for candy.
3,"Not the best, and larger than expected","This thing is the same length as my arm from elbow to knuckles. I am used to candy thermometers being about half that. You want it long so you aren't sticking your hand near boiling sugar, but not so long that it takes five minutes to register the temperature!By the time this thing registered soft ball stage, my sugar was well into hard ball. I've since learned to add about 15 degrees to whatever temperature this thing displays. There is no way to recalibrate it, so you just have to remember to do that.It's not quite as awful as some of the reviews on here, but it's certainly not great."
1,Broke while in normal use. Dangerous,"I've had this deep fry thermometer for a couple weeks and have used it about 5 times. I was heating oil to make french frys, stepped away for a bit and heard a ""pop"". I returned to find that the bulb of the thermometer had exploded, thermometer ruined along with the oil obviously.I'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement."
5,Good quality thermometer,I tested this thermometer for accuracy before using it and it was perfect. I love the way the bulb is encased so it can't come into contact with the pan.
4,CDN TCG400 Professional Candy & Deep Fry Thermometer,CDN TCG400 Professional Candy & Deep Fry Thermometer works very well good qualty. Easy to read Dial. A Good Price ans value.
3,Not useful for family candy making,This thermometer is about 2 feet tall. Not useful unless using it for frying or for making at least a gallon of fudge at a time. Your pot needs to be a large soup pot in order to even attach the thermometer to the side. I wouldn't have bought it if I had realized it was this big!
5,Great for deep frying,I purchased this item to monitor the temperature of oil in my wok and in my deep fryer; the clip is indispensable. After multiple uses the printed temperature scale didn't fade or peel off like some reviews of similar products claimed. By using it I also learned that the oil in my deep fryer heated up much more rapidly than the directions indicated; no more overheating oil and wasting time. I'm very pleased with the performance of this item and recommend it to anyone who wants to deep fry foods at home.
3,Does not start at 75 degrees Farenheit as described,"Under ""Product Details"" Amazon describes this thermometer as having a,""Temperature range 75 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 200 degrees Celsius).""This is not correct. The lowest marking on the temperature gauge is 100 degrees Farenheit.I cannot comment further - I didn't test its functioning - returning to seller for a refund, so I can buy a thermometer with a range that better suits my needs."
1,Numbers are rubbing off,"I purchased this thermometer 4 months ago for making homemade yogurt. The problem is that the numbers are rubbing off. I never put this in the dishwasher but hand wash only. I am very careful with it and I don't use it for heat above 180 F (although it is suppose to be fine with much hotter temps). A thermometer is only good when you can read the temperature, and it is getting harder to do this. Already several numbers are completely gone. Now I am looking for another thermometer after only 4 months."
5,There's no bottom to this black pool: Dive in anyway,"One of the landmark film noir movies, it stars William Powell as detective Philip Marlowe who gets involved in a case involving murder and a jewel heist. It's the dark side of humanity played out in shadows of the night. The dialogue is tough and sardonic, though it takes a bit getting used to hearing it coming out of Powell's baby face. When the women hug him and try to sweet-talk him, he cringes his face and rolls his eyes, but it's hard to believe him completely. Powell is conked on the head early on in the movie, and he spends most of the picture walking around in a semi-dazed state: it's as if the world has suddenly lost its moorings and is drifting in some surrealistic space and time. The scene where he's drugged and hallucinates is particularly nightmarish. The movie helped define the film noir genre and put the gritty hardboiled detective on center stage. And Clair Trevor as Velma is near perfection. Definitely worth a watch."
5,One Of The Best!!!!!,I love this movie! I got it about a year ago and I've about worn out the tape. Claire Trever ranks up there with Barbara Stanwyck in Double Imdemnity and Jane Greer in Out Of The Past as the ultimate Film Noir Bitch. Wonderful movie!!
3,It REALLY will NOT play on U.S. DVD/Bluray players.,"When I went to place the order for this great bit of ""Classic Noir,"" I noticed more than one warning that it would not play on US DVD players: It's Region 2 format.I blythely ordered one up ... feeling SOOOO superior because I had recently purchased a brand new Sony Bluray player, which I believed could play everything in the universe!!! So not right. After a bit more research, I have now learned that is not always the case.ANYBODY WANT A FREE DVD??? Let me know & I'll send it to you for free. I'm chalking it up to a good old-fashion lesson: verify any & all warnings/alerts you read about an advertised product. After all, they tried to tell me."
4,A good book of its type and great for a gift,"While not the best of the Penny-pinching guides this one is up there. Earl Proulexs short side trips about his long history as a contracter make this a good read as well as informitive. The 30 or so ""puzzlers"" (pictures of odd tools that you have to guess what they do) are fun and may bring back some memorys in the over 60 group. If you need a present for someone who likes to putter aroud the house (and says "" they dont make things like they use to"") this would be a great gift."
1,just bad photography and thinking,How I Learned Not to Be a Photo Journalist is over all a dumb book. The only intrusting thing about it is pointing out the conflicts between art and photojournalism. But other then that it's not much more then a not-so-bright individual's quest to make a not-so-good group of pictures.
1,Sex Down,"I have not received this package, been waiting just over a month now. Please follow up and advise. Your assistance would be appreciated."
3,Decent CD I guess,"Hey, this CD is decent R&B;, but nothing great. Link is pretty much just saying the same thing in every song talkin' about all the ways he wants to sex up the ladies, but he just uses different sexual lyrics from song to song to make it seem like he is being different, but the all-around message to each track is pretty much the same. Bottom line, I just did not feel there was a whole lot of variety on this album where the material was creative and different from track to track.Nonetheless though, I'm feelin' ""I Really Wanna Sex Your Body,"" but everything else on the CD is nothing special to me."
5,The Ultimate Get Your Freak On CD,"I heard this CD back in 1999, and when I heard it I fell in LOVE.Link is another talented brother that knows how to set the mood. I searched and searched for this cd in local stores here in TX, and couldn't find it. But when a friend hipped me to this site, and I searched for it and found it on here, I bought it with the quickness.This is another cd that is in HEAVY rotation in my cd player.I call this cd ""The Baby Maker"" because once you put it in your cd player and light some candles and have that special someone next to you...you better belive it's gonna be on and poppin.~kisha~"
2,It's like getting decaf when you ordered an espresso...,"While I was dying to see a new FM album for years, had I known this would be the final product, I would have begged them to hang it up after ""The Dance."" Nothing really stands out here, and at times it can feel like the same song playing over and over. Stevie's voice is aching and completely monotone. Her lyrics are dull and way too incomprehensible, even for Stevie! Lindsay does his thing like he always has, but no power ballads to show for. I'm sure John and Mick could have just left a tape of their parts and went home. On numerous tracks, the recordings just sounded awful, as if they were recorded in a pool. Christine was smart to exit when she did, though I think this ""never-ending"" tour they're have embarked upon would be far greater with her presence. Thank god at least Mick seems to still be enjoying himself on stage. It's a middle of the road work, but it's a dirt road in the winter."
1,"Give it up, the magic is gone.","I know how hard it is for a band to release a record 20 years after their first big hit; they can never get out from under the shadow of their earier work. But it was with high hopes that I picked up the new Fleetwood Mac CD, being a huge fan from the 70's. I couldn't have been more dissapointed. Most of these songs sound like bizare, drug-induced, self-indulgent nonsense, rather than the clever and unique earlier pieces. The magic is gone and all that's left is a little mis-directed talent of a handful of musicians that have completly lost touch with their audience. Like another reviewer, I'm going to throw this one away, pull out Rumours, and try to forget I ever hear this piece of garbage.Stevie, Lindsey, next time listen to your earlier works before you head back into the recording studio. Do your fans a big favor."
2,average&Missing in Action,Christine Mcvie is missing something badly on this set.while I think&Feel Lindsey Buckingham is a Very Talented Musician the direction here just doesn't fit the overall Fleetwood Mac Style&Vibe at there best.Stevie Nicks is cool still but the songwriting&overall arrangements&direction is lacking heart&depth for me.
3,meh,"at this point it feels like most of the former mac-ers would rather be driving their kids to soccer practice than jamming out in front of sold-out crowds. given the so-so success of this album and subsequent tour, i don't think it's too brash to suggest that Stevie, Lindsay, Mick and John join their former band-mate and tend to a bit more domestic matters."
1,Big Disappointment,"I was shocked to find this CD so disappointing, that I only could listen to 4 of the 18 songs all the way thru without hitting the ""forward"" button on the stereo. Definitely not the Mac of the past, and for sure I won't ever buy anything of theirs in the future. I have never been moved to write a negative review before, but I have to say this is probably the worst CD I have bought in a few years. Guess I should have listened to more samples before buying it out of the adoring faith of past work..... my mistake indeed."
1,Don't waste your time,"I used to be a Fleetwood Mac fan, but these songs sounds computer-generated and nonmusical. Why anyone would purposefully listen to this is beyond me."
4,Get out the remote control...,"This could have rivaled Rumours, which isn't as perfect as people now remember it being. (It's still pretty close.) Say You Will suffers from bulk and Buckingham. The bulk comes in the form of a 76-minute album that far outlasts its interest. Lindsey Buckingham adds volumes to this problem with songs like the unnecessary ""Come,"" a seven-minute thrasher which simply doesn't work, and the indulgent ""Murrow Turning In His Grave."" Cut this album down to 12 songs, though, and it's a thing of beauty. The title track, ""Miranda,"" ""Peacekeeper,"" and the spectacular ""Thrown Down"" are among the best of Fleetwood Mac's work, and that's saying something. A flawed jewel, perhaps, but with a little polish and a programmable player, Say You Will makes a fine album indeed."
4,Completely Different,"At first, I expected a traditional Fleetwood Mac CD. When it wasn't, I kind of pout it away for awhile thinking it was just not that good, and maybe a little weird. Then, I went to see Mac at the MCI in DC. The concert was one of the best I had ever seen. The songs that I thought had seemed so weird at first were great. I agree this could be almost classified as a Lindsey Buckingham CD, but it works. Murrow Turning Over In His Grave was one song I especially hated at first. But my first listen was on a cheap 59 dollar CD player in the shop at work. The song rocked in concert. Afterwards, I pulled it out again and threw it on in my car. This CD kicks... You just have to be able to HEAR it all. Highly recommended."
5,Amazing!!!,"Because i am a Stevie fan I raced out to purchase this CD the day it was released. So by now I've listened to it about a million times and at this point, I can truly say its GREAT, every track, there's no doubt about it..My personal fav is #4 ""Thrown Down"" By the way, did anybody notice it was playing at Joey's party on ""Friends"" last Thursdays. Ya, I sang everyword.(Just like at every Stevie concert I have attended,hee-hee!) My family freaked out on me, HA! Its the only CD in my car at this time, which says alot!!! I'd say go out and buy it-Its addicting!"
1,Not their best work,Missing the style of former pieces of glory - Kind of grates on the ear frankly - maybe too much agenda - still love fm just not this album
3,Not that bad - just a few terrible songs (Red Rover is horrible!),"OK - I listened to this again and it is not as bad as I originally thought. The title track, Say You Will is very good and there are several other good songs. Unfortunately, there are several terrible songs too that really bring it down (especially the unlistenable Red Rover!!) Limiting the album to the best 12 songs here would have made this a really terrific listen!!"
3,"A good effort, but Christine is missed.","I'm writing this after only two listens to the entire CD, but my reaction so far is: Sure do miss the down-to-earth influence that Christine McVie lent to the Mac. Lindsey and Stevie turn in some very nice performances here, but their eccentricities were always (in my opinion) easier to bear when every third cut was a Christine ballad -- without spacey lyrics and experimental instrumentations that sometimes work, and sometimes just interfere. However, there is one cut on ""Say You Will"" that has already become one of my favorite Mac songs: the title song (from Stevie Nicks). The melody rolls along happily, the lyrics are accessible and uplifting, and the harmonies remind me somewhat of '60s vocal groups like the Mamas and Papas. This tune helps fill the void left by Christine's absence. I wish the CD had a few more like it."
5,"Great CD, great band","Popular thought has it that, once a band has been going for as long as Fleetwood Mac has, they start to tread water and dry up creatively. As this CD shows, that's absolute nonsense. From the first track to the last, this is classic Mac that stands up there with the very best work that they've ever put out. The production work is both interesting and impeccable and the songcraft is superb, especially from Lindsey Buckingham. Highlights include ""Peacekeeper"", ""Thrown Down"", the title track ""Say You Will"" and two Lindsey Buckingham tracks ""Steal Your Heart Away"" and the instant classic ""Bleed to Love Her"" (first aired on their live albumn, ""The Dance"". I cannot recommend this CD enough - there is no doubt that, in terms of sheer songcraft and talent, these guys are at the very top of their game. It's early in the year yet, but a possible contender for albumn of the year. Truly superb work."
4,Brilliant...!!!,"The classic pairing of Buckingham and Nicks shines on this latest Fleetwood Mac album. Many of these songs have subtle reminders of Lindsey's Mac work in the 80s, with just the right amount of seasoning the years have brought to his skill. Nobody can produce Nicks like Buckingham. Fleetood and McVie have not lost their touch at all... keeping rhythm with Buckingham's sizzling guitar work is astounding and these two pull it off masterfully, as always. Buckingham recalls himself on Tusk; a few tracks on this album are very conceptual and creatively genius. This is one of those albums you listen to several times, then start to feel like there aren't enough songs on it, so you hit Play again. The only thing I don't care for about this album is the sequencing- it's a bit jagged; maybe that opinion will change with more rotations. Anyway...Thanks... it was definitely worth the wait for a new album from this dynamic grouping of musicians, despite Christine's absence!"
5,Fleetwood Mac,"This has fast became my favorite Fleetwood Mac album. I love the mix between Stevie and Lindsay. I feel like this album really shows what Lindsay can do (this album has the most songs from him that I actually like) and showcases what we have come to expect from Stevie. It is quite different from the other Fleetwood Mac albums, but I feel like that is what makes it stand out to me. They have changed through out the years and continue to make great music."
5,They Still Have It,The new album is a must have. Fleetwood Mac absolutely shines with this new album. The songs are wonderfully written and guaranteed you will listen to this album over and over. Fleetwood Mac hasn't remained around as long they have for no reason.
2,Mostly filler,"""Peacekeeper"" and the title cut are very good productions that should make future compilations (or maybe they have already). Otherwise, this is mostly a mix of Buckingham solo stuff, Nicks solo stuff with John & Mick backing them up which makes it Fleetwood Mac proper. Well, no it doesn't because Christine is no longer in the band and she is very much missed here. 18 songs was far too many, time to hang it up Big Mac and do the occasional nostalgia tour."
2,"Say what you will, but I'm disappointed...","Sure hope their tour is better than this album. Makes me wonder how good the tour will be without Christine McVie? I'm having a hard time getting through the CD the first time through. For the skeptics, I'll try it again -"
3,Underrated!,"I too was initially disappointed, having also felt like a child on Christmas morning. But, then, slowly, it really did start to grow on me, with the melodies 'sticking' and the impressive production coming through (though, yes, I miss Christine too).And that review in Rolling Stone can't be completely wrong."
3,Disappointing,"I love Fleetwood Mac but this cd is a little disappointing. First off, the cd could do without some of Lindsey Buckinghams experimental tracks that make the cd hard to enjoy. Second the cd is filled with too much filler that you have to skip through to get to the decent tracks that are mostly Stevie Nicks songs. Third, they are missing the great songwriting and songs of Christine McVie. I expected a little more from one of my favorite rock and roll bands."
3,Falls a little flat,"This CD reminds me of Behind the Mask-- missing band members = uninspired music. I think part of the chemistry that made so many of their true hits can only be found on the albums where all members are present. If you're a hardcore fan, buy it... if you're looking for something like Rumors-- forget about it."
4,Shocking Changes and Revelations,"""Say You Will"" is full of stunning surprises and personal confessions. ""Come"" addresses the obvious void here -- it's a beautiful cry to Christie McVie to come back to Fleetwood Mac. Of course, she's out of the mix, now -- which leaves Lindsey and Stevie to get closer than they've been in decades! Lindsey's ""Red Rover"" gets right to the heart of things, seemingly comparing love to a dog park where all the creatures are sniffing the breeze for clues. But watch out Lindsey, Stevie gets even more experimental with her gypsy raps. A strange and tantalizing brew of the old Mac stew!"
4,Refreshing,"No, it is not Rumours but it is something different and more textured that reflects 2003, ( Rumours is 26 years old!) It's remarkable that they can still produce great stuff after all these years.Lindsey buckingham is a genius and this CD definitely has a lot of Buckingham's traits, beautiful songs, incredible guitar playing and extraordinary production. This release shows a lot of growth combined with extraordinary songwriting skills, even though these guys have been playing together for three decades this has the energy and excitement of a new band. There are 9 outstanding tracks here and the other 9 are very good. Buy the CD, open the sunroof and enjoy your ride to work!"
3,NOTHING SPECIAL OR SPECTACULAR,"IT'S OK.....THE USUAL LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM TYPE PRODUCTION, GREAT SONG, FOLLOWED BY MEDIOCRE SONG. ""SNICKS"" IS IN PRETTY GOOD VOCAL FORM, FOR HER VOICE. THE BASS AND DRUMS ARE VERY GOOD, CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF TIME MCVIE, AND FLEETWOOD HAVE PLAYED TOGETHER. THEY PLAY AS ONE.AS TO CHRISTINE MCVIE'S ABSENCE......SHE IS MISSED GREATLY, HER STYLE, HER VOICE, WAS WAY MORE IMPORTANT TO FLEETWOOD MAC THAN WAS REALIZED. MORES THE PITY, SHE HAS ""RETIRED"", IT IS OUR SINCERE LOSS. MORE FLEETWOOD MAC RESPONSIBILITY HAS PASSED TO BUCKINGHAM-NICKS. WITHOUT A VEHICLE LIKE FLEETWOOD MAC TO DRIVE AROUND IN, THEY WOULD STILL HAVE MADE IT, BUT NO WHERE TO THE SCALE THEY HAVE."
4,"Fleetwood Mac ""Say You Will""","After leaving Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham was able to explore and refine his style and sound. This album is comprised of much of his work from his proposed solo album ""Gift of Screws."" The songs are generally good and catchy. I think Lindsey could have thrown in a couple of gutiar solos. Fleetwood Mac has a new sound and is back in the spotlight."
4,Pretty good stuff!,"This is only the 2nd Fleetwood Mac cd I've ever bought,(the first was Rumors)and I gotta say it's pretty good. There are some really great songs, like Thrown Down, Miranda (Buckingham goes crazy near the end with his guitar!), the title track, Peacekeeper, Ilume (a 9-11 song, Fleetwood Mac style) and Silver Girl. I waited for about a month for it to come out and bought it the day it came out. Can't wait for the tour!"
2,Say You Will,Say You Will being Fleetwood Mac's 17th studio album and 2003 and is a straightforward rock album. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with photos of the band. The problem with this release is that it is just not that interesting. Many of the tracks sound like b sides from their earlier singles releases. Allmusic gives this record 3/5 and I think this is a little high. To me it is a 2.5 but since I can not give this grade it gets a strong 2. 2/5.
3,Too Much Stevie,"I've always been a fan of Fleetwood Mac, but not so much Stevie Nicks in a solo capacity. This album needed more Christine McVie to offset the Stevieness. All of the Nicks songs seem a little too much like her eighties solo work, meaning I've heard it all before. They are still good songs but nothing in comparison to Lindsay Buckingham's work on this album. By far the most stand out track is Steal Your Heart Away which is the cleanest most upbeat single-ready hit on the album."
1,DVD Audio mix sucks,"I bought this album on cd and thought it good enough to spend the money on the DVD Audio version....BIG mistake. I thought at first something was wrong with my DVD Audio player..nope other discs worked fine. I took the disc back and exchanged for another one and had same problem. The music is just missing from some of the channels on some of the tracks. I get music out of some of the surround speakers but it's obvious when listening that someone screwed up mixing the music. I have a couple dozen or so DVD Audio and DTS discs in my collection, so I know what they should sound like, and although some of them turned out to be somewhat disapointing, this was the only one I felt ripped me off for $24 since I can't return it for a refund. (I tried and was told the disc was fine, it was my player!..never mind the fact all the other discs play perfect on it!)"
3,Disappointing,"Considering the substanial hype, it seems too much of a Lindsey Buckingham album. I know, I know, it started out as one of his solo albums before it was a Fleetwood Mac Cd. Well, I liked Buckingham's production on Tusk, but since then, it's been a little cheezy for my tastes. Also, there is some really excessive guitar wanking on a few tracks. Some may applaud it, or at least be surprised by it, but it sure gets old fast.Also, I thought I would be glad to hear an album without Christine McVie songs, but it seems a little empty without her musicianship. So, go ahead and pass on this one. Instead, seek out an independent group that may still have something new to offer."
1,Say You Will,"I could not wait for the new CD to come out. What a disappointment when all of the tracks sounded like everyother album they have done. Some of the base was way too loud. Sorry, I guess I like their older stuff better."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"I COULDNT WAIT TIL IT HIT THE STORES, THEN WHEN I GOT IT AND STARTED LISTENING TO IT, I THOUGHT WHAT IS THIS? MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE ""RUMORS"", OR MAYBE IM JUST NOT THAT DEEP, BUT I COULDNT BELIEVE WHAT I WAS HEARING. EVERY SONG TO ME WAS BIZAARE. MAYBE CHRISTINE DOESNT APPEAR AS A MEMBER BECAUSE SHE WAS THINKING THE SAME THING. SHE IS LISTED AS A CONTRIBUTOR (SP). TO ME LINDSEY'S SONG WRITING HAS LEFT ME CONFUSED. I GAVE IT TWO STARS BUT WONDERING WHY I EVEN GAVE THEM THAT. MAYBE THE SONGS WILL GROW ON ME, BUT THE FIRST LISTEN WAS A SHOCKER."
1,Say You Never Should Have...,"This ain't the warm and fuzzy Fleetwood Mac of the days of old, not by a long shot, so let that be your warning. What we have is 76+ minutes of strange/weird vibe noodlings. The only track that I would consider a possible hit is 'Destiny Rules', a fine Stevie Nicks track. Christine McVie wisely bowed out of this affair even though she is listed as an 'extra musician'. As usual, too much Lindsey and his weird ramblings and odd singing.The sound is definitely not Fleetwood Mac, so be prepared. Time to retire folks."
5,Powerful return,"I'll admit I wasn't expecting much from Fleetwood Mac on their return with this album, with the exception of Stevie Nicks-(her 2001 solo album Trouble In Shangri-La IMO is her best album to date), the rest of the group proved me wrong with this album, this album is amazing especially the title track and the first single Peacekeeper, younger acts should take a lesson from FM, even without Christine McVie this album really shines. Of course, with every FM album there are experimental tracks on the album, most of them are good, I just don't think Red Rover is the best track they have done, but that doesn't really hurt the overall power of this album. Highly recommended!!!!"
3,Strong come back,Things have changed a bit for the band but they still got itit takes a few spins but it grows on you.if you like fleetwood mac you will like it.
3,Chrstine is Missed - A Reasonable Comeback Album,"This is a great 12 track album. Unfortunately, it has 18 tracks.There's some really good stuff on this album, but its mixed with tracks that definately should have been eliminated during the editing process. Come. for example, should have gone...This will go down as a reasonable come-back album, but definately not the same caliber work we were used to seeing from FM. Christine McVie is missing and unfortunately it shows. I hope that she will agree to collaborate on any future releases.I'm not sorry I bought the album, but it could have been better."
3,I'm Glad they 're Back,"But you know this is really a Buckingham/Nicks album with Mickon the drums. The absence of Christine is a big disappointmentonly because her ballads are some of their best work and issorely missed here. This album is a good album and isworth the purchase. From one who has been a Mac fan since thePeter Green days ....the true REAL GENUINE FLEETWOOD MAC soundis still not here. I still long for the Kirwan, Green, or Welchaddition. Unfortunately they don't sell so we'll take Buckinghamand Nicks. Hey its better they did this album than not to have done it. You'll enjoy it. I rank this 3.5 ...Bare Trees and Future Games are my 5's."
4,A retooled Mac serves up a great album,"A lot of folks may lament the loss of Christine McVie from Fleetwood Mac...Take solace in the fact that she guests on the Bleed to Love Her track and sit back and take in a great album. Stand out tunes like What's the World Coming To?, Illume, Thown Down, Say You Will, Peacekeeper, Steal Your Heart Away, Bleed to Love Her, and Say Goodbye easily make this CD worth buying.I didn't buy the 2 CD special edition, so I cannot say if that is worth it, but the ""regular version"" is more than worth your bucks. Congrats to FM for a great comeback!"
4,"Fleetwood Mac, back in action!!!!!","It was well worth the wait. Fleetwood Mac is back with an incredible album. True, it is a tad long, but the gems sparkle like diamonds. I have to say that Lindsey Buckingham brings out the best is Stevie Nicks' songs. She sounds more aggressive and adventurous than ever. 'Everybody Finds Out' is incredible, and the closing track, 'Goodbye Baby' is haunting. That being said, when Lindsey is by himself, he veers off track. Stevie keeps him reeled in a bit. They will always sound the best when they are together...Randy"
4,"Not the same as 1979, but mostly excellent anyway","This is a very good CD, but it takes time to appreciate it for what it is, instead of what I imagine it could be. It doesn't have the great songwriting and harmonies of Christine McVie, so the Fleetwood Mac ""sound"" isn't quite there. It is not quite a return to Fleetwood Mac's glory days. Stevie doesn't sing like she did on Tusk. Time has gone by. What it does have is many excellent songs by Nicks and Buckingham, great guitar playing by Lindsey, and the usual solid rhythm section of Fleetwood and J. McVie. It also appears that Nicks let Buckingham do his own thing with production, resulting in something closer to Buckingham's ""Out Of The Cradle"" than a regular Fleetwood Mac CD. Yes, it is a little overpacked and has a few songs that would have been left off if Christine McVie was still around. Still, this is a keeper, and I'm glad Nicks and Buckingham decided to reunite, whatever their reasons were. I hope they make a few more albums together."
3,High-Res Multichannel is OK!,"I was disappointed at first because the Hi-Res Stereo is no better than the CD version, both are compressed WAY TOO MUCH!The Hi-Res Multi-Channel (5.1) tracks are much better in terms of compression (less) and dynamic range (more). If you have the tools you can make your own stereo mix from the multi-channel files."
4,I want more,"This is a great album with a lot of different sounds and styles. Now, how about a remix of ""Thrown Down""?"
2,Quantity over quality,"Why did Fleetwood Mac feel they had to fill the CD to its maximum length if they had so little say? The canvas of 45 minutes or so suited ""Rumours,"" ""Mirage,"" etc. just fine, and millions hardly complained that they weren't long enough and or that they didn't get their money's worth. I'd rather hear a tight lean album, than wade through a rambling set of songs like ""Say You Will."" ""Say You Will"" clocks in longer than ""Tusk"" and that adventurous, often masterful album seemed padded. Plus, ""Tusk"" had the THREE vocal perspectives of Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie. Sadly, McVie's warm soul is missing here, leaving a sonic and emotional hole. We're left only with some lovely moments (mostly from Nicks) buried within Buckingham's obviously inventive but overdone production. Overall, a major dissapointment."
2,BARE TREES,"Feels more like one half of a Lindsay Buckingham CD put along side one half of a Stevie Nicks CD. Buckingham likes to push the envelop of sounds in rock music by recording noises in unusual means. After twenty years this has gotten to be very old. Stevie Nicks sounds like a bar maid who has drunk too much whiskey and smoked too many cigarettes over the years. Neither Buckingham nor Nicks are appealing these days and putting them together doesn't change that.Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are indeed present on the album; but that is the only thing which makes this a Fleetwood Mac CD instead of a Buckingham/Nicks project. Musically, neither Fleetwood nor McVie are really necessary. A host of other drummers and bassists could have done the job. And Christie McVie is terribly missed. Her skills as a songwriter, performer and vocalist could have raised this CD above the awkwardness it finds itself in.This CD makes one wish for the days of Danny Kirwin and Bob Welch again."
4,"Wonderful, but...","Forget what you saw on the TODAY show this morning, when Lindsey was up too much in the mix and Stevie too far down, and they all looked like they were freezing to death -- NBC should have known Fleetwood wouldn't be at their best, and so should we. As for the album, let's face it, it's in the studio that this band really shines brightest; nonetheless, SAY YOU WILL is like a visit with old friends. You sit back and let the music wash over you and it's like you're back in the summer of '75... only it's 2003 and they're older and the music's got that been-there, done-that, world-weary edge to it that seems to be permeating the newer CDs of survivors like Joe Jackson and James Taylor. Christine's absence is felt, however, which is ultimately what prevents this thing from lifting off into the pop stratosphere. Perhaps that's why they sounded so off this morning... oh, who knows? It's the Mac. Lets' enjoy 'em while we got 'em."
2,At times you need to let go of the name and recreate,"Talented musicians, of course, but you expect a certain sound and that is missing here with disparate attempts to recreate themselves for the times."
2,missing mac,"ok all of you band members get on your knees and BEG Christine to come back. I listened to this on youtube by around track 8 I realzed that this band has lost all ability to see what doesn't work. Drums and bass are virtually non existent. There are a handful of better than average songs, but most are below average. A new band trying to release this music would never have even been signed to a recording contract."
5,really great stuff,"this is on par with anything the mac ever did (yes rumours included) this is a great album and a real good 5.1 mix. lindsay buckingham at the wheel so far as i can tell, and also at the peak of his powers musically. get it"
4,A Stellar Return!,"Rumours it is not. But does it have to be? No. It is what it is and that is an excellent album by a band that proves they can be still relevant in today's pre-packaged pop world. Sure it's a bit long and some songs are a bit quirky but FM have eanrned the right to flex their creative muscles a bit. So you get some quirk but you also get gems like the incredible ""Everybody Finds Out"" (when those disco strings come in I get shivers), ""Miranda"", ""Come"", ""Ilume"", ""Say You Will"", and ""Destiny Rules"". This is a perfect summertime album, put it in and pretend it's 1977. Put in Tusk or Tango if you miss Christine McVie, put in this album if you just want to hear a great band making great music once again."
4,The Mac Is Back...But Still Missing Something.,"Fleetwood Mac's first studio album in 8 years, and it's first with guitarist Lindsey Buckingham since 1987, has all the characteristics of a classic Mac album. Stevie Nicks' deep vocals match her eclectic lyrics quite well, and Buckingham's dark and occasionally confusing songs are well represented. The album, however, is missing a key component in former keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie. McVie, who is responsible for such hits as ""Don't Stop"", ""You Make Loving Fun"", and ""Say You Love Me"" has retired from the band. Although she provides backing vocals on one track, her absense is quite evident. McVie's optimistic and happy music was the glue that held the band's music together. Her beautiful voice also was key in Mac's famed 3-part harmony.Best bets on this album are ""Thrown Down"", ""Smile At You"", ""Peacekeeper"", and the title track, which is destined to become a hit."
4,"""Peacekeeper"" rips off ""Kodachrome"" but good song...","Although I think ""Peacekeeper"" will be a classic, and it's a great song (read the lyrics), however the chorus is a blatant use of Paul Simon's ""Kodachrome."" ..."
1,Epitaph,"For even the most ardent fans of Fleetwood Mac, Say You Will may prove to be an epitaph on a tombstone for this once great band.Though the abscense of Christine McVie serves as a dissapointment to most, that is not the problem with this release. The CD should have been entitled the Buckingham Nicks finale. While the rythmn section of Fleetwood and McVie are quite superlative in form on Say You Will, they seem like the backup of the other members.The album is full of techno pop synthesized guitar and vocals by Buckingham and Nicks. It is completely divorced of reality as ifit were the remnants of some mad dream. Buckingham has never really proved himself to be of the caliber of former guitarists Peter Green or Bob Weston from the spectacular Behind The Mask release. Save for four or five songs, the album meanders on in the new millenium.Fleetwood Mac should have called it a day after the great live The Dance CD. It was their peak of a very long career."
2,bizaare,"i admit, i was hoping for another ""rumors"" like effort and i didnt get it. i did like ""murrow turning over in his grave"" but other than that, the music was hard to accept as being good. am i just shallow?"
3,"Not very good, folks","Die-hard fans will give a thumbs-up on just about any new material that Fleetwood Mac releases. This CD is really two things:- The Buckingham/Nicks followup album that never was.- The worst Fleetwood Mac album since they joined the group.A few good tunes, such as the title track, and ""Peacemaker"", and a few more listenable ones sung by Stevie. That's about it. Lindsey's songwriting here is comparable to his tracks on ""Tusk"" - none too good, though he continues as an unusual and interesting guitarist/producer. Not surprisingly, Christine's wonderful pop-sense is sorely missed in this effort."
1,The Expiration Date is Showing,"I saw the VH1 special and fell for Mick's and Lindsay's hype. The lyrics have never been more trite, the melodys never more shopworn. Christine made the right decision by opting out. The only positives here are that Lindsay probably was able to pay for his new house, and I bought the CD used. A once great group should call it a day and join Christine on the musical sidelines, the expiration date is long past due."
1,stop yourself,I have been buying music since 1969..I own all types of cd's and love MUSIC. This is not music. It is a bunch of folks older than myself..and I consider myself on the verge of middle age..self indulging fantasies that they can sing and write music. Hitting the intended note seems beyond the reach of the songs on this CD..I wasted 10$ and would love a refund. My kids asked me if the cd was broken. I long for the happy melodies iof Rumours..this one makes Tusk seem like a good idea.
1,There won't be any 'roumors' about this cd,"I was excited to get my new copy of this cd, but was very disappointed with the lack of content I found after playing it. I've always been a big fan of Fleetwood Mac, and I guess it is tough to top 'Roumors', but I at least expected 'Say You Will' to be as good as 'Tusk' (which seemed to put them on a downward spiral). I don't think there's a single hit song out of all 18 cuts on this cd. Definetly none you'll find yourself singing in the shower.Stevie's got a great voice, but it seemed too many of the songs were written at the lower end of her range. Much of it sounded more like Bernadette Peters in 'Blazzing Saddles'! And if you listen closely several songs have a hint of bluegrass in them. Not that that is all bad, just totally unexpected.Don't be tricked like I was by the VH1 show 'Total Access'. Save your money and buy the old stuff if you don't have it now. There won't be any roumors about this cd.......no one will be talking about it at all."
1,Absolute Garbage!,"Lindsey really put the nail in the coffin of Fleetwwod Mac with this one. I've been listening to FM since 1970, and I can take their ups and downs. Lindsey first tried to destroy them with Tusk. They actually synthesized Stevie's voice on this junk! Screaming guitars, poor playing, and poor recording make this a gigantic dissappointment.I love Stevies music and even she sounds terrible on this. But I recently saw her in concert and she still sounds great! So the recording, synthesizing and overdubbing (or whatever) ruined even her on this abomination. I have to think LB did this on purpose (he produced the album, right?) in attenmpt to put the Mac (and Stevie) out of business to make more room for his mediocre solo efforts. Unfortunately, he may just have finally succeeded.Rubbish."
1,Say You Will - Fleetwood Mac,"I just bought this at my local Border's Book Store. It won't play on my Dell Laptop - So I can't listen to it at work!I looked for a warning on th package. It's in the super-fine print on the back, camouflaged by the background of the cover.I don't recommend you buy it."
5,Welcome back Lindsey...you have been sorely missed!!,"On first listen I must admit I wasn't sure about some of the tracks on this CD, but after a few more listens I think it's an absolute masterpiece.Lindsey's more experimental songs (Murrow, Come) didn't throw me too much as I already own his ""Out Of The Cradle"" solo CD (another masterpiece...buy it now if you don't have it!!).It took me a couple of listens to get into some of Stevie's songs but they have grown on me...no one produces her like Lindsey and her songs are much better than on the solo ""Trouble In Shrangli-la"" CD which I found rather disappointing.I know I'll get shot down in flames for saying this by other fans, but I agree with other comments about Christine McVie not being missed...I also thought some of her songs were rather whimsical boring numbers.Buy this now if you like to hear an old band not just putting out radio friendly fodder like so much rubbish around now!!Lindsey, you are a guitar god!!"
2,Reality shatters all illusions,What a complete disaster! This album is horrible. The songs are utterly forgettable. And Stevie Nicks sounds like a chipmunk on steroids. I had to turn it off. How sad.
1,"It's a joke, right?","Un-listenable hogwash comes to mind. While I do believe myself fully capable of self hypnotic enthrallment when it comes to my favorite artists, this one stretches the bounds of delusion to the breaking point. While it'll sure just sell and the catatonically faithful will sing it's praises, anyone who stays connected to planet earth during their listening experience has to come away wondering what the hell the point of making this was. The Mac's done some great stuff in the past, but this is, in my humble opinion, unmitigated [bad music]."
1,Horrible Disappointment,I turned on the CD player with the anticipation of a child on Christmas morning and my excitement soon turned into disappointment. There are maybe three songs on the CD that I liked the rest are very abstract with lyrics that are equally out there. ....
1,Not Worth The Money,"The most dissappointing FM album I've ever heard. Ecclectic, self-indulgent and dull. If you are a fan of the Rumers-era Mac, this is not for you. Songs lack melody and charm. Most fall victim to Mr. Buckingham's penchant for over-production and his typical ""let's see how far out I can get"" attitude. The songs on ""The Dance"" were all FAR superior to anything on this album. I don't know what happened. My advice would be to listen to as many samples as you can before you fork out the dough. I wish I would've."
1,The magic appears to be gone!,"Upon my first few listens, I feel safe deeming ""Say You Will"" a massive disappointment. The absence of Christine McVie is a major impediment since it is too Stevie and Lindsey-centric. The tracks are hardly memorable and some are downright lousy. Perhaps if they didn't focus some much on quantity (18 total tracks), the quality would be significantly better. The only standout is the title track, and even that song seems destined for obscurity and will likely wind up relegated to a doctor's office soundtrack."
1,"No, I won't","More drivel from one of the all time most boring groups in rock and roll! Oh, I WILL say that Stevie Nicks still sounds like a duck!"
5,The Mac is back,"Fleetwood Mac's first studio album with Lindsey Buckingham since 1987 and first with Stevie Nicks since 1990, was well worth the wait. Stevie and Lindsey both still are in fine voice and their songwriting is great. Lindsey's guitar skills have improved and of course, what can you say about Mick & John. Watch out for a few Grammy's for this album."
5,"Good CD, Great Album","I really like this CD. But I love my edited version.After taking a pole of the 2, 3 & 4 star amazon reviews,I got an idea of what the real fan favorites are.So I programmed the old Cd player:01) What&#65533;s the world coming to04) Thrown down05) Miranda07) Say you will08) Peacekeeper11) Running thru the garden13) Steal your heart away14) Bleed to love her15) Everybody finds out16) Destiny Rules17) Say GoodbyeYes!!! It does take me back to the days of 33 1/3's . But what's really nice is, if I get tired of these songs, there are plenty more.And a couple years from now I'll be really glad it is a long (76 minute, 15 second) disc. It may be years until another. Thanks FMalbum."
4,Lindsey is the MAN!,"After reading some of the reviews on here, I had to post my own. This is a very solid CD from this band. Considering that all of the are in their 50's, it doesn't sound like they have lost anything. As a matter of fact, my first thought when listening to the CD was ""Yeah, sounds like classic Fleetwood Mac"". Most of the songs on here are very good. And I am so glad to see Lindsey Buckingham taking some chances musically as well. Everything nowadays is so watered down and bland. This guy is a guitar genius, and songs like ""Murrow Turning Over In His Grave"" and ""Red Rover"" are killer! Stevie Nicks sounds good as well, and most of her tunes (like ""Say You Will"" and ""Smile At You"") really add to the CD. Her voice always seemed to grate on my ears after a while, but as far as she goes, she's in top form. The last 2 songs (""Say Goodbye"" and ""Goodbye Baby""), are the perfect way to end this solid CD! You shouldn't be disappointed!"
3,Good CD But Not A Great Effort,"I have been waiting for this CD for a long time. My initial impression is that the CD is way too long. 18 songs are too many. Too many songs sound like experimental recordings. Having said all that, this CD has some very catchy songs. ""Say You Will"" and ""Peacekeeper"" are the most radio friendly songs. I also enjoyed ""Steal Your Heart Away"". ""Running Through the Garden"" was the strongest song.Both Stevie Nicks' and Lindsey Buckingham's vocals sound somewhat toned down for this CD. Obviously, Christine McVie is missing from the line up and it shows. I will not say I was disappointed, but I cannot say I was totally impressed by this CD. I may change my mind when I listen to this more."
2,What you are listening to?,"I promise to listen again - but this cd is plain awful. Could Christie McVie have been that important to overall vocal quality and musicianship? The songs by Stevie Nicks sound like the person who wrote them has 0 ability - and although Lindsey is my absolute favorite guitar player, what the heck is he doing?I couldn't give it 1 star - but that is what it deserves. Do not compare this with Tusk - these songs are no where near the quality."
4,not the same without christine,i love this cd honestly. the music is great many of the songs are still like the old versions of fleetwood mac. still not the same without christine mcvie. but she does do back-up vocals so if you are a fan give it a try.
3,Buckingham Nicks 2,"Some nice things on this album, but you have to wade through some of Buckingham's more self-indulgent moments like Murrow and Red Rover. Highlights include the title track, Peacekeeper, What's This World Coming To. At eighteen tracks this is too long...especially since they are missing 1/3 of their songwriting/singing talent. More Tusk than Rumours."
4,A lack of Christine...,"Well, I had been waiting for a new Fleetwood Mac album for years, so maybe I had very high expectations. ""Say you will"" is a good cd, and I must say that it has some of FM's greatest songs (Peacekeeper, for example), but now I've found out that without Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac is really missing something.I've always thought that Stevie Nicks is one of the greatest composers and singers in the world, and she certainly is, but now listening to this record, without Christine, I know that the old saying is completely true: ""You don't know what you got until it's gone...""Five stars? No... One star for each member, one less star for Christine."
3,"Is it just me, or is this a disappointment?","Love 'em, and kinda bought into the new CD because of all the play a couple tracks have been getting on the radio. But is it just me, or is this a tired half-effort of their usual brilliance?? Very disappointing, but I keep playing it with the hope that soon the familiarity of it will bring a better liking for me...."
5,Excellent garage door opener...,"Excellent size and function, perfect for attaching to car key ensuring one does not leave it around or loose it."
5,A Must Read/Must have book for any person in leadership,"Excellent! Cover to cover. Author takes practical, historical examples of leadership and applies them to the present. Don't miss this book. You will refer to it again and again."
4,Good history and interesting analogies,"This is a fun, easy read with a moral lesson attached to each of the biographies. The Joan of Arc piece was especially well done."
5,Fantastic approach to leadership,"This was an outstanding book, not only for those in leadership positions, but for all to read. The author took a unique and creative approach, using principles from outstanding leaders in history. This includes a lot of information about these leaders that I hadn't read in other books, and it really gives a call for ethical leadership and the responsibility that leaders have.Excellent reading - well written and unique approach. A MUST READ!"
1,Airplane Maintenance,The book is to general and it is imposible to make repairs with it. It gives you theory not practical!
5,TRAFALGAR,Very good combination of first hand accounts and guidelines from historians. PURCHASED AT AMAZON.
5,The best Charlatans cd yet,"Stand out tracks - 'Forever', 'Senses' and 'Beautiful Friend'- Three of the best songs they have ever written. Buy this cd!"
2,Dud,"Where oh where are my beloved Charlatans? Gone are those no-holds-barred organ riffs, the percolating bass lines, and the psychedelic guitarwork. In its place is a ""mellow"" album that is pretty dull. I understand that bands must mature and move onward. However, this shouldn't occur at the expense of boring the band's audience. This is not the same group that I had come to love over the past ten years."
3,Us and only us and Dylan and the Stones...,"Though there is very little originallity on the their new album the Charlatans UK have made a very cohesive album from start to finish. The songs flow smoothly from one to the next making it sound like a complete record rather than a bunch of songs just thrown together in any particular order. The Charlatans UK are definately showing off their influences almost to the point of recreating them note for note. The 5th track ""A house is not a home"" has a repeated guitar riff that is pulled from Dylan's ""I don't believe you(she acts like we never have met)"". There are several songs that recreate the Dylan/Band early sound which is not an easy vibe to capture. There is also alot of ""Exile on Main Street"" on this album. Though you feel as if youv'e heard many of these songs before they do have those tight bass lines weavig through the songs that give this record that great ""Manchester sound""."
2,Disappointing,"I can't help be a little disappointed with this album. I'm a huge Charlatans fan, but this album is a departure from their sound of layered organ and guitair riffs. Instead, they've decided go mellow and more acoustic. It seems as if they really miss Mark Collins, their recently-deceased organ player."
3,"Nothing extraordinary, just good.","After nearly 10 months of listening to this album and trying to decide whether I liked it or not, I can now see what's good about it and what's so bad about it. The good...Impossible, Senses, Forever. The bad...the acoustic dylan-esque tunes. Those songs just don't sound like the Charlatans. Tim's voice at times is even a bit annoying like on My Beautiful Friend. I've seen the Charlatans live 4 times, and the tour for this album I have to say just wasn't that great. I think the Charlatans are losing a bit of steam, but I hope they can follow this album up with something refreshing and energetic."
4,"It All Comes Together on ""Us and Us Only""","If you're a fan of all the albums that make it into those ""Top 100 Classic LPs of All Time"" lists, which always include many Dylan, Stones, Zep and Hendrix albums -- I think you'll be digging ""Us and Us Only."" Sure, the Charlies have been criticized for injecting Dylan and the Stones into their work. But when it comes right down to it -- so what? They put a subtle pop twist on classic sounds they *clearly* revere. If you've ever been into the Charlatans' music, DON'T overlook this gem. And, reserve judgment until you've heard it twice. By the third time you play this, you won't be able to stop. Current faves: ""My Beautiful Friend,"" ""Forever,"" ""The Blonde Waltz"" and ""Watching You."" The true joy is, this is one of those discs that contains no filler -- *solid* from start to finish. *Can't wait* to see them play this out live at Roseland Ballroom. --JJJ"
1,Red light is awful,"To echo a previous commenter -- The size of this flashlight is terrific. However, nowhere was it disclosed that the light was red too! If that had been disclosed, I wouldn't have bought it!!!The GOOD news is that the item is available, even (with shipping) less expensively, at Amazon.uk. Just bought four to replace the red ones, which I returned for full credit. From House of Scarves, total credit card charge = (for 4x) 34.46 (British pounds). The one you really want is BLACK, and the light is WHITE."
4,I like it,Red light for preserving your night vision. I learned that in the US Army long ago. It seems to be well made and the LEDs should last a long time. I am packing this with my camping gear for when I go out into the field. I shall see if it lasts over the years in storage.
5,Heavy Duty,"This base has a newer lift design, then the HTC Porta base that I purchased. I was somewhat worried that the plactic levels would be an issue but so far they have been fine. I would purchase another one in the future"
1,ended up in the dumpster,"with other positive reviews and other stores having it back ordered, thoguth it would have been a good product. After two hours of fussing with it, teh brakes dont work and to quote my head of props it was a POS. so out into the dumpster it went. Save your money and find a better unit. This one is made in china and apparently without too much in the way of quality control."
4,Mobile base,"Built strong works fine, but The problems I have had with this base is the nuts and bolts keep coming apart with the vibrations from the table saw. I recommend that whoever buys this also buys some locktight for the treads."
2,Heavy tool? No bueno!,"I tried this base under my 500lb granite top cabinet saw. The thing was flexible and wobbly as heck! The thin side rails flexed, the plastic adjustable pads flexed, the sheet metal corners flexed. I think this stand would be fine with a light weight tool, but with something anywhere close to it's advertised capacity, don't waste your time and money."
4,Very nice base,Item arrived quickly and was easy to assemble. Seems pretty sturdy and moves my 500lb plus table saw around very easily. Definately would recommend this to any one looking for a well built moblile base.
5,Great Mobile Base,"I have purchased the HTC mobile bases and while they are good, I found this one easier and better to assemble. It literally goes together in about 3 minutes. I purchased it for a Jet 16 in. heavy duty planer and it rolls smoothly, locks great and I am completely satisfied."
3,Typical Chinese Quality,"A far cry from what HTC used to make, but if you can't find anything else, this might work for you. Feels flimsy and I am no where near the weight limit. One bolt just popped apart (head came off) 2 days after assembly with no weight on it. Everything about it screams out ""cheap""."
2,Not stable enough,This mobile base is similar to the HTC1000 and HTC2000 except that it is rated for heavier loads.I did try to use it for my 500 LBS bandsaw. It does hold the weight but the design of the mobile base with straight rails just isn't good enough to absorb vibrations of heavy machinery.I think angled rails or much stiffer ones would be necessary.I did since use a shop fox base with much better success.
2,Not stable enough,"Not stable enough, May 10, 2007Reviewer: E. Weber ""woodworker"" (Nashua, NH United States) - See all my reviewsThis mobile base is similar to the HTC1000 and HTC2000 except that it is rated for heavier loads.I did try to use it for my 500 LBS bandsaw. It does hold the weight but the design of the mobile base with straight rails just isn't good enough to absorb vibrations of heavy machinery.I think angled rails or much stiffer ones would be necessary.I did since use a shop fox base with much better success."
1,Stay away from this one!!!,"After a quick look around at mobile bases I bought this base even though it had gotten mixed reviews. BIG mistake. No instructions, lots of assembly and the result was way short of my expectations. My 450lb cabinet saw is way too heavy for this base. It sags like an old plow horse. The outboard wheels are way too flimsy. The whole saw leans toward these wheels and the floor lock levers seem way too flimsy. I don't known enough about mobile bases to recommend another brand but I do know this one is not worth the money."
2,Poorly Designed,"What's killing this product is that HTC went with cheap plastic lifting pedals that raise and lower the base. Mine lasted for about 2 years and then both pedals cracked. My table saw weighs 450lbs. The floor I am working on is flat, I move my saw about 5 feet each time and I have never left the base stay in a raised position for more than 2 minutes. I'm going to contact HTC to see if I can get a couple of replacement pedals (at a reasonable price). Make the investment and go with a base that does not use plastic pedals as this is the critical leverage point for the entire base."
2,"really disappointed, not strong enough, cheap materials","I snapped about 4 bolts in half on this thing just tightening the rails together. That just shouldn't happen, for 700lb rating that type of flimsiness scares the crap out of me.When I lifted one of the rear wheel stops, a piece of plastic snapped off from the pressure.All in all, i was looking for a no-joke, heavy duty monster that scoffed at the weight of my jointer/planer, this thing just didn't cut it."
5,Essential indeed!,"This is a great compilation of songs by artists most of whom I'd never heard of (besides Bloc party, Babyshambles, The Kills and the Libertines).Opening track 'Retreat' by The Rakes is a catchy dance/rock song a-la The Killers or Franz Ferdinand, complete with buzzing guitars. A great way to start this collection.Other outstanding tracks are 'Do everything I taught you' by Alterkicks, the jangling guitars of 'Drink to moving on' by Grand National, the sunny, upbeat 'Killamangiro' by Babyshambles (Pete Doherty's band) which bears more than a passing similarity to former bandmates The Libertines 'What becomes of the likely lads' (present on this compilation too).There's the Courtney Love-like 'Feel me loud' by Be your own PET, the eerie acoustic 'Voices' by Espers, the upbeat Smiths channelling 'Once upon a time' by The Boyfriends, the catchy 'Mirror Kissers' by Cribs, and 'Love is a deserter' by the Kills with its pulsing guitars.The CD title really says it all. Truly essential!!"
4,Great,Everything is perfect. The trucks squeak when they bend but someone tells me that's normal and it'll go away. Its great
1,Broke after 8 uses,"This broke at the bottom after being used as a candy thermometer to make brittle after about 8 uses. Also, the metal clip that holds it to the pan is very weak and did not hold the thermometer in place while cooking. Won't buy again."
1,Not for candy making,"There is no way someone can succeed in candy making with this thermometer.First, it's not precise. Water was boiling at 97 C or 206 F. I'm usually ok with this as I can adjust the temperature I want to reach.But in this case, it's graduated every 5 degrees and some of the lines are super bold. There is NO WAY someone can read a precise temperature!It may be ok for deep frying but not for candies!"
1,I REALLY hate this thermometer,"I guess I'll start with the one plus - I'm three uses in and it hasn't broken yet. Per the other two reviews, I only have a few more uses left, so it's possible it will break on its own before I throw it away from frustration. This thermometer has several design flaws. 1) The top numbers are in Celsius, which tends to throw me off. 2) You need to hold the thermometer at a very precise angle to even see the mercury level. This is not the angle the clip holds it at. 3) The glass fogs up constantly, obscuring the temperature reading. 4) The clip falls off very easily. 5) The temperature creeps up very, very, very slowly. I can't even say this is decent for the price, because I believe I paid way too much for it. Emphatically not recommended."
5,This is a great product !,"Before buying this I read all types of reviews for it. Positive and the negative and basically I just wanted to try it out on my own anyways. So far this thing is GREAT for components inside the computer. It has 3 speeds [Low, Medium, High]. It is NOT noisy at all. It has LEDs and it really blows a lot of air. It's decently flexible and sturdy. the gyroscope like fan is brillant since it makes it easier to blow air in a specific area. You can also screw this product in ANYWHERE on the motherboard or the comptuer case. It was defintely worth the price and keeps my RAM cool or my northbridge cool. I have to give this 5 stars since I can't think of anything negative about it. Every experience is different for the next custoer. I can easily tell you that I'm satisfied with this product."
1,"Great idea, but weak arm and poor fan pivot design.",A simple idea for a simple need. But poor design or manufacturing results in a fan assembly that doesn't stay in it's pivot mount or it's position. And the adjustable arm is so weak it bends out of position with it's own weight when using in a tower where the arm is horizontal. I won't even get into the fan itself as I can't use this fan with it bending out of place any time the PC is moved or even the fact it's never in the place I want to begin with since it won't hold it's shape under it's own weight. Now I have to see if I can return it and if it's worth my time. I should have listened to the other guy that said the same thing.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,This innovative product has brought my VREG temps down ~10c. I was leary of this fan at first as I was concerned with the quality prior to the purchase. It's attachment method to one of the mainboard screws works very well and I am able to contort the fan into just the right spot to cool my VREG. The one downside is the fan plastic seems a little frail but has not broken so I guess it is ok. Assemble this fan design with a better fan guard and sleeve the wires and you easily will get 5 stars for this product. I bought this product in July and I have not experienced the problems with the arm being weak that others are reporting here. Perhaps the arm has since been improved as I have not had any problems with it.
3,"Quiet fan, good air flow. The swivel is not stiff enough.","As the title says the fan is quiet even in the high position(3 speed fan). I would not trust the fan not to move about in a computer supported by the swivel. The swivel can't even support the fan weight, it bends down. I wire-tied it to the Power Supply cable in the case and positioned it to blow on the non-heatsinked southbridge chipset. The chipset now runs cool. It worked for me."
4,Excellent fan,"Delivers cooling where you want it. Has good adaptability. Gets quite loud at high settings, but what are you going to do?"
4,Great job Antec,"The good: This is not a perfect product but it strikes a nice balance between cost and quality. Quiet and efficient fan with built-in speed control that you can swivel around in place and position to hit in just the right area. Works in a surprisingly tight space, in my case it is cooling my RAM and northbridge in a HTPC rig with a 4830 for gaming . Screwed this thing onto a mobo screw, turned it to lowest speed and heat problem solved. LED makes a nice spotlight for maintenance in my case. This is a LOT nicer than my usual two sided tale a fan in place solution.The others: I wouldn't recommend it for a case that is getting moved around a lot as motherboard screws aren't designed to support a fan at the end of a 6 inch arm. I would like the fan to be more securely mounted in the swivel head but once in place this isn't a factor."
5,Good cooler,Put this on my son's pc where his mother board would get hot. Doing a good job of cooling and it looks cool too.
2,Flimsy,"The neck will bend 90 degrees while keeping its shape. The flexible neck and the fan swivel is so flimsy it is very easily bumped out of place anytime you open the case to perform minor maintenance (blowing out dust etc). For this reason I didn't use this fan, I threw it in my box full of surplus computer fans."
1,Worthless garbage,"I like the idea of this, but in practice it is completely worthless. The fan is so heavy that it causes the screw to rotate, making it impossible to make the fan stay in place where you want it to. Also, the neck is not as bendable as it looks. It simply goes back to a straight position after a few seconds. Save your money and save yourself some frustration... do not buy this."
4,Conceptual Excellence {4 Stars},"The Atlanta, Georgia trio (most popular for their spots on Adult Swim commercials) consists of emcee Mr. Wyzard, and DJs Synthesis and Dainja. Mr. Wyzard produces all but three of the tracks and his sound can be summed up as boom bap with a bouncy twist. With well thought out conceptual rhymes, tight beats, and excellent scratches and cuts from DJs Dainja and Synthesis, Psyche Origami is proof positive that rap music from the south can be so much more than the misogynistic zombie music that you see on television or hear on the radio."
3,it looks smaller online,the watch is very handsome and was a terriffic buy. the scale of the watch is not what it looks like on line. it is a very large watch. you will have to have a large wrist to wear this watch.
2,"Dial too big , had to return","I liked the design and overall appeal of this watch when I saw it on net, but my jaws dropped to the floor when I opened the case when it arrived. It was just not acceptable cause the dial was HUGE , if it would have been bigger by a millimeter , it would have become a sun-dial. I intended to gift it to my father before , knowing that he has a big wrist , but I thought that it wont even suit him, so hobsoned choiced , I had to return it to Amazon. looks are great but the size not acceptable atleast for me."
3,NOT backlit,"Although the description on Amazon says that the display is backlit, it is not: I ordered this item only to discover that it is not indeed backlit (confirmed by the packaging, manual and on the manufacturer's website), but also that at 11"" it's considerably shorter than most thermometer forks, which will likely lead to some very hot fingers over the grill.I'd suggest looking at the same company's model DTF212CDN TempFork Thermometer(also available on Amazon), which is only a little more at $19, but is almost twice as long and does have a backlit display, along with a bunch of other features that may come in handy."
2,never really worked correctly,"the number flutter and your not really sure what they are ending up at, To much trouble should just be poke and read, There for product has never really worked correctly."
2,Slow,It is a good design but is very slow to come up to temperature when inserted in the product. I have to hold my grill open way too long (and wear a mit) in order to get an accurate reading. I compared it's speed with two other thermometers and it was far behind. I think all thermometers should list a speed specification.
2,"Nice Case, But Take Out a Sharp Knife!","This case comes in a plastic box that is impossible to open! Ok I found a sharp knife and cut the box to pieces.The case is very nice but don't put your knife away because you will need it to cut out the ugly plastic screen protector. I did that anyway and don't regret it. The screen is protected when the case is closed.Then my case was too big for my iPod! To solve that I put some double sided tape around the screen to hold the iPod in place.With my modifications the case deserves a 5 star rating, as it came in the box I can't give it more than 2."
3,Not enough music.......,"For those of you who like the music video of ""Signal in the Sky"", you'll love this CD. It not only includes the music video version, but an acoustic version that sounds absolutely wonderful.Two other songs, ""If You Want To Wear A Hat"", and the acoustic version of ""Stream Running Over"", are great as well.But the live version of ""Heroes and Villians"" sounds like it was recorded by three five year olds fighting over the placement of the microphones. ;) You can't hear a thing, and there's static all over. Not the best oldie re-recording out there.This CD really needed more songs, but the quality of four out of five tracks made it worth at least three stars. I do think that it's a great introduction to the style of Apples In Sterio, which reminds me a lot of Simon and Garfunkel. Also a fun little tidbit for fans of cartoonist, Craig McCracken: Charicatures of the band by the creator of PowerPuff Girls."
5,a totally entertaining red hot novel,"Among other romance writers, mrs small would always hold a special place in my heart. i know, iknow it sounds corny but her books are really somewhat special. i especially love darling jasmine, about a young princess of a moghul emperor who travels to the royal courts of england because her lustful half brother salim,wants to marry her. its just fantastic. there a lot of unfortunate accidents which keeps on happenin to jasmine beloved ones to( her 1st husband, then her 2nd husband and finally her much beloved very young prince of england, they all die) plus the lovemaking is so very hot that it would blow u off. you just cant miss this book. if u r a regular romance reader looking for somethin new besides stephani laurens and rosemary rogers .then i would recommend this book to you.ENJOY!!!"
3,It was my first,This was my first Beatrice Small book. I was hooked from the jump. It made me want to go and hunt down all of her books. I really wanted to read about Skye O'Mally. I am glad I did read this book I picked up at a friends house. She still does not know I have her book.
1,"Dull, Contrived and an utter waste of time",I dislike giving a book such a bad review as an author puts so much heart and soul into their writing but honestly Beatrice Small would have been better spent putting her time towards a more worthy cause. This book was extremely dissapointing and I can only be thankful I checked it out of the library and didn't waste money buying this. Her writing is talented enough but the subject matter and convuluted story nearly drove me insane.Romance should make you feel and care for the heroine but this novel never achieves this. It is like a dark trumped up Catherine Cookson but nowhere near as good. A bit of adversity and darkness is acceptable in a romance if only to make the reforming of the hero/saving of the heroine more poignant. Romances don't have to be light fluff but they should leave the reader feeling content not disturbed.Each to their own but I think this is not romance it is rubbish.
4,wild jasmine,I really love Bertrice Small.I really enjoy the O'mally books the best.This is another good book.
3,Skye O'Malley gets tired.,"I started this book with great expectations, knowing just how wonderfully Bertrice Small can spin a tale. I came away from this book feeling a bit disappointed. Jasmine shows absolutely none of the sense and courage that her grandmother Skye had, and indeed I at times wanted to reach out and smack sense into her. I think that with this book, Skye O'Malley's family has simply grown too large and too complicated to keep up with. Jasmine's character could have been taken places, in wild ways that even we couldn't have discovered. Instead, we receive a selfish, supremely spoiled young woman who has absolutely no common sense, and indeed while she births several children, doesn't seem to care too much about them.For any other book, this would have been an okay read. For a Bertrice Small book, this is a rare disappointment."
3,Sweeps you into a magical time and place.,"This book was a beautiful look into the Mughal dynasty of India. Her (B. Small) words are so descriptive, that you feel as if you are part of the novel. You get swept away by Jasmine de Marisco/Yasaman Kama Begum as you read of her tales of childhood to her adulthood. Bertrice Small used an inventive way of combining the tale of the true Shah Jahan of India (the creator of the Taj Mahal) and the fictious life of Jasmine de Marisco."
2,It's nifty.... but could be even better...,"I recently got this timer - it's certainly loud enough when it goes off to draw you attention.A month or so after I got it, it no longer lets me set the clock. So this recent daylight savings time shift, i had to wait till (the new) midnight to take the battery out and put it back in so that the clock resets to the right time.Increments of the countdown is set by the minute - which is perfectly adequate.What I wish this timer had was an alarm setting for the clock, this whould have been easy for Polder to implement, and would have made this a much more multifunctional device."
2,Was looking for something quiet for my son's nap....,"I bought this timer intending to use the ""hourglass"" feature to give my son a timeframe to stay in his room (and hopefully fall asleep). I assumed - poorly - that because this was modeled after an hourglass timer (which is very quiet) it would not have a loud alarm. Unfortunately, not only does it have a loud alarm, it beeps for 60 seconds if you don't stop it! I really wish I could turn the sound off. I'm definitely not going to use this timer for nap/quiet time."
4,"light, entertaining book for all","I found this book easy to read and entertaining at the same time. The story line carries you along so you don't want to put it down! The underlying moral message is refreshing admist the shallow books that are mostly available for teenagers or light readers, and there is enough action and intrige to keep the story interesting to young minds. I would definitly recommend this book for any parent trying to encourage their kids to read."
4,Not an Extension but a very adequate cable,"Although this cable is described on this page by Amazon as an Extension, which would be M-F, I was looking for a regular DVI-D M-M cable. I checked the StarTech website, and their code, DVDIDDMM15, as shown on this page at present, is correct, as are the connector images. The cable itself works well for my Dell PC to BenQ flat panel TV connection. By the way, StarTech do not seem to make any M-F extension versions for DVI-D at this length."
4,Works as advertized,I use this to connect my PC to the TV at 1028x1024 resolution and it works perfectly. The price is very affordable (even monoprice does not have it for less!)
2,Breaks easily with normal phone use,"I switched phones recently, but went through three of these covers on my Razr. One specific issue is the plastic tabs that ""fasten"" the top cover. Seems that after continuous flipping, they just break on either side. They are very thin plastic, so I wasn't baffled by the breakage.The cover does stay on if only one tab breaks, but if more break, it's time for a new one. I used double-sided tape at one point to adhere the cover to the phone."
4,Great Work Vest,"I've had a chance to use this vest at work this January, and it has performed well. While not constantly outdoors at my job, I do spend a fair amount of time in the cold, and this vest keeps me warm. The pockets in front are nice and big for tools and whatnot. The inside pocket is useful as well for pens, etc."
2,Waste of Money,"This was nice and warm when I put it on, but, shortly thereafter the plastic frame just broke apart. Waste of money since now it does not stay on the seat. How sad!"
3,commode cushion,The cover makes sitting on the portable commode more comfortable for my 88 year old mom. The frame separates a little too easy when it's romoved and washed.
2,It holds an odor and must be washed frequently,I was not sure when I ordered this item if it would work or be worth the money. keeps your bottom warm (smile). Material does not move around on the seat stays in place.
5,Beautiful,"Actually this was purchased by my daughter as a Christmas gift for my husband and I- what a great surprise and since we arlready have 2 other Pooh prints by Ellenshaw, we were thrilled. It is currently at a store getting framed !"
5,Love it!,"I love this product line and I love this specific product. First tried it when given a sample at my dermatologist's office and was hooked. Very pricey in office, but saw this size container and the price on Amazon site and thought 'this can't be the same product', but yes, it most definitely was. Deep cleans and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. Love it!"
4,Good product except for packaging,This product smoothers into a non-greasy foam but the packaging is not so great. The holes are too big causing a lot of wastage when i pour it out.
2,Contains Talc,Not sure whether talc is harmful or not anymore. Did read that as of 1975 talc with asbestos can't be sold anymore but it's not completely clear whether asbestos is the only problem or whether talc itself is cancer causing. But was disappointed to find it in here non the less.
5,awsome,this book is anionted. I have not put it down. I'm carrying it around with me like its the bible. Some of the questions I have as a leader is being answered. thank you to Mr.Damazio.
2,NOT a stand-alone book,"Very rigorous and methematically precise, but how can this text not even mention Ito's lemma? Well, because it isn't really a ""sequel to Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus by the same authors"" but more like the second half of that book. Unless you have their BM&SC; or another similar reference by your side you won't get very far . . . and this fact is not at all apparent from reading the editorial description or jacket review.For a self-containted text with both the basic math background AND the finance I recommend either Lamberton and Lapeyre (fairly complete but with some technical proofs referred to BM&SC;) or Joshi (lots of applications, less mathy). Neither of these will be as comprehensive or rigorous as the 2-volume Karatzas and Shreve but both are good introductions to the subject."
5,No - we're not dysfunctional!,"Splitting Up is more than a hip handbook for the times we live in. It should be required reading for anyone getting married for the first time or contemplating a committed relationship!I would have to concur with Frolick - divorce today is neither a legal or therapeutic problem - it is a serious cultural issue. Respect, trust, rapport, love - here today . . . gone tomorrow. We are a consumer society and regretfully, Western society has de-personalized relationships. It is so easy, albeit very stressful, for one party to simply walk out - baggage and all, in search of greener pastures!I truly enjoyed this book . . . I tell you it makes for a great conversation topic at any boring dinner party!Do yourself a favour - read the book. The selected biography also lists lots of interesting books on this subject."
3,Buddleia 'adonis blue',"The plants were packed well, and grown into the pots. I ordered 4 plants, 3 of which were in good shape, in the other remaining pot there was soil, and roots but no plant! I didn't see evidence of any plant stem in the shipping box either, so well see if theyll send me another one."
4,Would have given 5 stars but...,"First, I must be say that the puzzle is of very high quality, it is fun, and very durable. For the prize on Amazon, it is an excellent buy. Now, here is why I am a bit disappointed. I asked my daughter to find all the countries in the continent of South America that are on the Equator. To my surprise she did not list Ecuador. In looking closer at the map, I noticed that she was right and that the map was not drawn properly. This is an error, and I don't know what projection was used to generate the map. Common, Ecuador must be placed in the Equator... and that made me conclude that the map may not be accurate elsewhere as well.So if you are one of those who believes in accuracy, then think twice... I would have given it 5 stars but, you now know why I did not..."
5,Magnificent Map Puzzle,"I bought this for my son who is aged three. He is a geography wiz and loves all things map, atlas, globe and map-puzzle related. This one is a bit too difficult for him to put together but it has countries and flags on it (he also loves flags) and he like to identify each one, its capitol and its flag as I help him put it together. Since he is just beginning to read it is also a great way for him to memorize spellings and prompts that will help him when he really begins to read. It won't be long until he is able to do the puzzle all by himself. This would also be a great teaching tool for elementary aged geographers."
3,Distracting shapes weaken value of this puzzle,"I have been looking for a straight forward map of the world jigsaw puzzle for kids and this was the only one I found that was even a candidate. But what frustrated me was that the borders and the enlarged views of certain geographic areas made the map confusing as a learning tool for my ten year old. I am still looking for a really clean, simple world map jigsaw puzzle with countries and their capitals. Jig saw puzzles are a terrific learning tool but there need to be a lot more options for map puzzles available for children."
3,"Better than the first, but...","Well, I think Kristine did a better job on this CD then her last one, but I'm still slightly disappointed.Her songs are more appealing to me, but I feel that she has to much pop in this one. Although I know that she is a pop singer, I still think that she could have toned it down a bit more with the techno stuff.This is an OK CD to have, but I don't really recommend getting this unless you're a fan."
4,"No complaints about the tunes, but not enough notes","This CD takes me back to my youth listening to my parents' 78's, where I learned a lot of the great Cole Porter and Irvin Berlin songs. This has all of Ethel Merman songs I wanted on CD, and some surprises, like a duet with Bert Lahr performed before a live audience. The only thing it lacks is anything but the most basic information about the songs. There is no information about the dates of the recordings, the musicians, or even the names of the shows the songs are from. The liner notes have only three pictures of Merman, and one of them is from ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" in which I don't think she sang a single note. Nevertheless, if you want to have everything you need to hear from Ethel Merman on one CD, this is it."
3,Few pictures,I bought this hoping for lots of color pictures to use a reference for a photo shoot. I didn't get the pictures i wanted :(
3,Good but needs updates,"I have come to like this book as it has given me a zillion new ideas and especially where to find those things. Each section is organized with lot of colored pics of houses and brand products. Although the idea of mentioning the names of the companies which sell products in the end of a chapter is excellent but it needs updates. Many telephone numbers are incorrect or have changed, as I tried many of them. And there is NO MENTION OF WEBSITES at all which I find surprising. Most of these companies have websites now.Overall a good book/guide to start with. And then move on to more specific catalogs/publications."
5,works great for my homebrew operations... i'm sure it's good for a turkey cooker too...,I've been using this thermometer for my homebrewing activities and it's been great. it's pretty sturdy and the clip fits nicely on my HLT. Well worth the price!
1,Didn't work,"Great clip, great length for my kettle, thermometer doesn't work whatsoever. It read close to 200 degrees F when I took it out of the package, I assure you it was not that hot out. It eventually got down to below 100 where I would expect it to rest until use but when I tried using it it read 100 give or take 50 degrees above two other thermometers, which are much shorter, but actually work. This occurred regardless of how far I put the thermometer into the kettle and as such was not an issue of the length differences or heat distribution in the kettle. Still, great clip."
4,accurate and easy,I use this thermometer for my turkey fryer. The one that came with the fryer was damaged in the box. I got it on sale locally. It was easier to buy a new thermometer and this one works just fine!!None of them seem well made but I hope I get a few years out of it. I only use it a couple of times a year!
1,My bad,"the product is a good buy, however, i do not know if it is my fault, or maybe the site forever seems to scale the actual size, the product is actually not what i wanted. This is pretty huge, wanted something that could fit in my chef jacket's pocket, but i guessed wrong...totally my fault like i said, or amazon downsizes the product size too much. out of all, this was generally total dissatisfaction, however, the product is a good one."
3,Not For Shallow Frying,"I'll keep this short. If you are frying in 3+ inches of oil, this is probably a great thermometer. Anything less than 2.5 inches and you will be disappointed.The reasons:The temperature sensor is located 2.5 inches from the very bottom tip of the thermometer. So, if you don't cover the sensor with with a little liquid more to spare, you won't get an accurate reading. This means that you'll want a different thermometer for shallow frying or candymaking.The readout is consistent and the holder works fine to keep it at the right height and the correct distance from the sides of the pot. It calibrates easily and accurately. Perfect for turkey fryers.It gets 3 out of 5 stars from me because I expected the sensor to be a little closer to the very tip of the thermometer. With the adjustable height of the holder there doesn't seem to be a very good reason for such a distance."
4,Not bad for Wort Boiling (Homebrew),"Bought this thermometer exclusively for Home Brewing. It has temperature limitations from 100 - 500 deg. This makes it difficult for yeast pitching, as you must have a temp lower than 100 deg F. It can be difficult to obtain a thermometer that is long enough to reach the heart of many larger sized brew kettles, so this is a good starting point. Comes with protective sleeve and kettle clip. Length and accuracy get 4 stars. Long shipping wait gets -1."
2,A Turkey!,"I didn't purchase this thermometer for deep frying a turkey. I just needed it for my counter top deep fryer. But as I tested the temp of the oil, I got the feeling that the thermometer's calibration was off. So I tested the temp of the oil with my Thermapen Instant Thermometer and, sure enough, the deep fry thermometer was off by 20-degrees. That would have been enough for a 3-star rating, but even worse, after calibration the deep fryer thermometer didn't hold the calibrated temp. The only positive thing I can say is that the thermometer is easy to calibrate - and it should be since calibration is required so often."
1,Unreliable,The temperature reading would fluctuate at least 20 degrees up or down whenever my husband touched the thermometer. It was not reliable at all!!!!
2,Non-functioning,"This thermometer does NOT function at all. Upon being placed in anything warm to boiling, it doesn't register but a tinsy bit after being on liquid for over 5 minutes. I tossed it as I long ago trashed the packaging and figured I couldn't return it."
1,Beware of copy protection on this set,"If you intend to listen to this CD set on your computer or portable device, be aware that this set contains one of those insidious copy protection schemes that prevent normal listening unless you install special software, and also only allows you to save the tracks in special MS proprietary formats. No, thanks.While Amazon does mention it, this information is buried under the header ""Format: Enhanced"". I would never have come up with an idea of calling it an ""enhancement"". I think Amazon should change their terminology to prevent such misunderstandings.I am returning the set."
5,Mireille Matthieu Platinum Collection,"If you are a fan of Mireille Matthieu then this is an essential cornerstone CD collection of 60 songs that showcases the incredible talent and voice of this incredible French singing star. I have to confess that I do not understand French but, in a way, that is an advantage because it allows me to concentrate and listen to the tones and expressions of her voice - which are absolutely superb and out of this world. Even if you are not a Mireille Matthieu fan but you like to listen to fine singers, I strongly recommend that you buy this CD collection and listen for yourself - you will be pleased that you did."
5,lizzie,It is a wonderful collection of many old favourites.If you don't have any Mireille Mathieu in your collection get this one.
5,Perfect,This Atlas is perfect for anyone studying or wanting to know moreabout the Bible geography and history and how they relate.Especially in these times. Seeing pictures and maps truly makethe stories of Bible people and places come alive.
5,Air Cleaner replacement,Not much to review. The Hamilton Beach TrueAir is excellent. Since I am a chain smoker. it's a must have in my little apartment.
2,Nice Effort but Vague and Imprecise,"As the only most complete Ethiopian cookbook, I commend the author for bringing his book to the people. Some of the history and notes are interesting read and the general effort is commendable, even admirable.However, I don't believe the author actually tried to cook using his own recipes out of that book. It seems to me he merely asked ""authorities"" (Also Known As Ethiopian mothers) who mainly cook by taste and vision and wrote down their best guesses.The indexing is more like the Table of Contents with extremely limited value. As a person of Ethiopian decent I tried many times to use this book, but, alas, perhaps because I'm just too used to the Sunset Magazine's way of writing recipes, I was never able to actually make anything following Exotic Ethiopian Cooking cookbook. One really needs to be knowledgeable about Ethiopian cooking already and simply get ideas from it in stead of following it to the tee."
2,Eh.,"As the only Ethiopian cookbook I could find I bought it, even though the other reviews were less than glowing. The history section was the best part of the book, the recipes are indeed vague and not that great. The injera recipe was particularly awful. Now maybe these are far more authentic than the ""Americanized"" versions I've had in restaurants all these years but considering the people who own and operate these places are from Ethiopia I can't think they're too far off (yes I know McDonald's and Taco Bell are not the best representation of US and Mexican cuisine but I digress) I've had much better luck with the recipes picked up online."
3,"Good cookbook, but calls for ingredients that are hard to find","I got this cookbook because the reviews said it was the best Ethiopian cookbook out there. That could be true. It could use some glossier pictures, but the recipes seem good. But some of the ingredients are very hard to find and relatively expensive. It typically isn't worth the time and cost to prepare many of these recipes at home - I go out for Ethiopian just as often as I did before getting this."
5,Easy and Delicious,"I grew up in Ethiopia and desired to make this delicious food. After acquiring this book, I have fed my family many dishes from it.The recipes are easy to understand and the directions a breeze to follow. All the ingredients can be bought at an Ethiopian store or the regular grocery store. There are recipes to make basic ingredients such as Berberi, used to cook chicken, beef, & lamb as well as legumes. Also recipes to make the spiced butter and oils that are basic ingredients in every dish.I love this book. I hope you will write another so I can learn more."
2,"Good starting point, but consider all measurements as suggestions","This cookbook is good as it is the only Ethiopian cookbook out there. However, the ""tested"" recipes are NOT tested. For example, the recipe for gomen calls for 1 pound of collard greens and 1 pound of butter. Some recipes call for 1 cup of berbere, which is about 90% cayenne pepper! Use these recipes as a starting point, but think about every measurement before you add the ingrediends or else you'll find the food too greasy or too spicy."
3,Hard to understand ...,"I have owned this cookbook for many years. I love Ethiopian food and eat it whenever I can afford to eat out at my local Ethiopian restaurant.I also love cookbooks and use them often, both to recreate childhood favorites and to explore new cuisines.I have, however, never managed to cook anything from this book. I find the instructions confusing and somehow the presentation makes it all seem so daunting.The cultural and traditional notes are fascinating and easy to read, though."
4,"Great toy, many components to choose from","The kit contains many different types of gears and things to do with them. The kids (4 andn 6) opened it Xmas day and were already building things without adult input, which was a welcome surprise. It seems to be quite intuitive, but lots to learn once you try for more complicated setups. It seems to be of good quality -- doesn't feel like things will break easily."
5,Very good,Elvis Raw Early Live Recording is so special to me. I really really love it. I bought it with some other Elvis albums and it's a nice addition to my collection.
1,Cheap & Not what was pictured,"Based on the picture & product description, I ordered this headset for my Samsung D807. The original list price was [...] and it was promoted as an ""Amazon Exclusive"" and reduced to [...]. What came in the box was a joke. Crappy, cheap plastic, the clip already broken, the headset was stuffed into a little ziplock baggy with no instructions or product description (not that phone headsets need instructions, but accompanying paperwork is reassuring). Plus, what I got did NOT match the pictured product. I immediately called Amazon and they sent out a replacement (as long as I sent back the one I got). When I got the replacement, it was the exact same piece of crap I'd gotten before. These headsets are like something you'd buy off a table from a sketchy guy in New York. DO NOT ORDER THIS HEADSET, it's a total rip-off. I am now completely happy with the headset I ordered directly from Samsung for [...]"
1,Tin and Terrible,"The sound quality of this headset is awful. I don't know how I sounded to others, but they sounded terrible to me. I bought them because they were cheap. I got what I paid for!"
4,Cute Children's Book,"My husband and I used to read this book to our children when they were small. It became a family favorite to the point where everyone in our family had it memorized! Sadly, my husband sold our copy in a garage sale. Our children were devastated that their childhood book was gone. Fortunately, we found this one on Amazon and ordered it immediately! While it is not the actual childhood copy, it is serving as a nice replacement....the condition was about the same as our original. We are pleased."
5,A wonderful Classic,"I just wanted to share that my Mother recieved this book for me before I was born. Growing up it was my absolute favorite! It's simple yet charming.Now that I have a son, my Mom sent it to me for him. Even though he's a boy, he still makes me read it to him over and over. This book has lasted over 20 years and still going strong."
5,what a great find!,"I am so pleased to have found this book that was a favorite of all my daughters. Since it is out of print, I found it for my granddaughter at Amazon.com. It was in better shape than I anticipated and am so happy to have found a copy to pass on. Very cute goodnight book for children of all ages."
5,brings me back,i purchased this book because i lost my original copy i had when i was a kid and i loved the book. when i saw it on amazon i had to have it
5,The next generation,"My daughter called me last week asking for the title of ""our version of Goodnight Moon - you remember Mom, the book you and Dad read to me that ended with us saying 'Goodnight'!"" A quick search on Amazon got me to My Goodnight Book and within minutes it was on the way to my new granddaughter. What wonderful memories and how blessed we are to have a daughter who feels we did so many ""right"" things for her as she grew up that she wants to recreate everything we did for HER daughter! Now I only wish I could find the original, much loved and literally chewed up version at my house!"
4,Always nice to reflect on,"Nothing really needs to be said, nice to reflect on, many of his words are still used today and still relevant."
1,Unreadable piece of crap,The font in this volume is so small one cannot read it with out a magnifying glass. Find another edition! Quick!
5,Socrates free,"Free for my Kindle 3G. Lots of reading, easy and free download. There are lots of other free ebooks for you,"
1,This is boring,"This is really really really really really really BORING! I hate it. It stinks. If I had known that this book was this bad I would not have gotten this. I am really happy that this was free. I suggest to you not to wast the time, and to read insteadThe Hunger Games,The Hunger But Mainly Death Games: A Parodyor,The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1), but notTwilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)."
3,dakan,"Interesting film from Africa. It just appeared a lot of wasted time past before these two finally matured enough to get together. I understand the culture and what is ""expected"" from the son in a family but, these two finally got it together to still begin a life journey. Too bad for the wife and child though."
1,A lot of yelling,"I was disappointed. Too much yelling. The characters are underdeveloped and not realistic. A good premise, but wasted opportunity. I wouldn't spend the money for this. Wait until someone can really tell this story."
5,"I love the suggestions like ""can freeze here or continue""","This is my favorite cook book. Aside from the ""master recipe"" concept, it is very helpful that he always tells you where you can break off work so you don't have to do everything the same day."
3,"Basic, for beginners",There's not much here that you can't find in Joy of Cooking or any number of other basic American cookbooks.
5,One of the top three,"A wonderful, RELIABLE cookbook. Organized beautifully, recipes are excellent. This book, along with Joy of Cooking ( 1975 or earlier edition), and the original New York Times Cookbook are on my shelf of honor. They are all you really need."
5,Very Pleased,I've been using Vista since the Beta came out last year. I just installed Home Premium on my system and its been prefect. One note for power users you definitely want at least a Gig of RAM this baby loves it.
1,Don't get what you see,"when I'd order my item I sow a totally wrong picture of it they show an original Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit for System Builders [DVD] picture, and they send me a operating system disc that works whit gateway computers only, (used) that was some thing I can not used at all."
5,Works great!,"I just finished building a new computer and need an operating system. My old computer was a cheap Emachines that only came with a recovery DVD which you can't use on any other computer. I searched around and read alot of complaints about Vista but I decided to try it. It was very easy to install, everything was automatic! I have been using it for over a month now and haven't had a single problem with it. Its fast and has very easy to use features! This System Builders version is alot cheaper with everything that the retail version has! I would buy the 32-bit version because there isn't alot of support for the 64-bit version yet."
3,Windows XP is the same,But the service was clean and snappy. I would buy from the Pioneer PC store any time. See their store here: http://www.amazon.com/shops/A2FPORFL2U4F4X
2,wrong shipment,was soo excited with a good deal from amazon. To my dismay they sent in the wrong cd - SP1. Big disappointment.
3,Buyer beware,"vista home 32 premium OEM is OK.Just be sure that your hardware is relatively new.My Lexmark printer and Sound Blaster Live card arenot going to be supported in this OS. If your happywith your system and arent buying a new computer for awhileget the OEM its cheaper and is the same as the $100 more on.I recommend waiting to buy Vistas till the first service packcomes out, Vistas is still unstable. I am getting Blue Screensof Death daily (yeah they brought it back, grrr). But it did fixproblems that I had with my video card and once more companies maketheir product Vistas compatible I would give this product 4 stars.No 5 stars since they released a product far far to early."
3,"Great, but not for pc hardware more than a year old !!","It's fast, cool looking, & more stable than XP BUT if you have a pc with any hardware thats more than a year old you take your chances.The problem is DRIVERS !! while Vista has a pretty largebuilt-in driver base there are many video cards, soundcardsnetwork cards, printers,digital cameras, usb devices etc that have no driver support and probably never will.This is not all Vists'a fault, the oem manufacturers of these itemswant you to buy their new models and don't want to spend the $$ tore-write drivers for Vista. While some of the XP drivers will workthey can also make Vista unstable and prone to freeze (especially USB devices) which kinda defeats the purpose of getting Vista."
2,Not worth the upgrade particularly with Paralells,I bought this in order to be able to use it on my iMac using the paralells virtuall machine. The aero interface and hardware acceleration isn't available yet. Obviously part of this is due to the virtual machine software but even standing on its own Vista isn't ready for prime time yet.
4,Good Music,Good old music.Very happy with this.Was in good condition.Love the jackson 5 when they were young.Try to listen to it as much as possible.Happy to have it.Would recommend
5,Now I get it!,"My mother was (and is) a huge fan of the Jackson 5, but they were so much older than me that I only listened to them because of her. She used to talk about how gorgeous they were, but they're all my father's age. However, over the years and with listening to more Michael Jackson music this past week, I have even more respect for the group that brought out Michael Jackson the solo artist. (Whoever this guy is in the peach shirt on the bottom right-hand corner is gorgeous, by the way.) I knew all the songs by heart before I purchased this CD (courtesy of my die-hard Jackson 5 fan mother), and somehow the songs sound so much sweeter. Again, it's terrible that I waited until Michael Jackson's unexpected passing to pick up a Jackson 5 CD when they really deserved my money far sooner. Excellent CD. I press play and let the entire thing play out, but I have to replay ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" a few times because that's always been my favorite song of theirs."
5,I have waited so long for this,"If you are from london England and now living across the otherside of the pond, you will just love the christmas specials of only fools and horses. Nothing better than having a few mates round and watching this with a few pints. I loved evey second of this collection. well done my son!!"
4,a set fit for DelBoy,"I'm glad to finally see this release, however, the 4th disk containing the final 3 episodes, does not work on my player. Anyone else having these issues?"
3,Small Issue,"My husband about cried when he opened this! He loves this show from when he was growing up. Unfortunately, when we got to the 4th disc it wont play. He is devastated because its the finale of the series. First 3 discs worked without a problem but 4 wont even read."
3,Fly Fishing - Imitating Stoneflies - Marsh,"This is not a DVD that will teach you to choose materials, hooks, or patterns to use in imitating stone flies. Neither does it give you tying techniques, nor is there a thorough discussion of various rod and line manipulation techniques to imitate stone flies.There are seasonal entomology lessons combined with the advise to imitate the size and color of the natural with a suggestive pattern, primarily the nymph........ok!The Index is edited in a way that creates confusion and the transition from one section to the next is abrupt at times leaving the impression of ?""Where the heck is this going, what happened?""There is useful information in this video, but I'm going to look for something by Rick Hafele that covers the same subject."
3,Could Have Bee Better,"If your a true fan of Luceno's books, you'll love this one. Otherwise, stay away from it. The action filled parts are off-set by way too many slow areas. The plot is stupendous, but could have been executed better."
5,awsome teaching tool,"This book is easy to read and is chuck full of information on all facets of the game of basketball. The book is written at a level that a 12 year old will be able to read and understand the information. Topics range from body fitness/performance awareness, mental conditioning for shooting, defense, rebounding, intensity, quickness; strength training, mental rehearsals, analyzing pregame and post-game performance. It was very enlightening and helped me in different aspects in getting points through to my grandson. For the couple dollars spent it has more information in it than all of the other youth basketball books/videos I have combined. This also received praise from my daughter who has become a basketball student herself."
5,A very different kind of coaching book!,"This book is about coaching the mental side of the game of basketball. I got my copy way back in the 1980s when I was in graduate school and working on my masters in sport psychology. It was great to see a book that actually took all of the theoretical stuff I was learning in grad school and applied it in a meaningful, practical way that basketball coaches could then take and apply in practice and help players learn the mental aspects of the game.I do want to say the book is easy to use, but I suggest not reading it in order the first time through. Read the first several chapters for background information and then jump around to the sections that your team, or you as a player, need to work on right now.This is fun stuff to use with your players and the mental skills they will develop will have carry over into their personal and professional lives later in life.Kevin Sivils"
2,Don't waste your money on this,"Nice idea, especially with two barrel sizes, but it simply doesn't work. Very little power, and the pusher does not push down evenly. It kind of wobbles down, which means the dough is not dispersed evenly."
5,to the lady in san antonio:,"are you all norwegian or what????did you check to see if there are any batteries in it,or if they are not good? my friend dana thinks that you are a DDDDUUUUUUUUUHHHH!!!!!!!"
4,Mine works great!!,"The first time that we tried it, it didn't work at all, but we were using a chilled sugar cookie dough. When we tried it using a room temperature spritz cookie dough as requested, it worked fine. The motor was slow, but I only had to hold it down for the 2-3 seconds that it says to. I cranked out whole sheets of cookies in a couple of minutes."
1,Does Not Work---Buy Something Else....,I gave this cookie press to my Mom as a gift. It does not work. I am so disappointed that she received such a poorly made item and now she will have to deal with sending it back. Please save yourself the trouble of having such disappointment yourself and buy something else....
1,Only worked twice,"I received this press as a gift in 2003, and used it the first time Christmas 2004. It worked fine then, and I was very excited to have spritz cookies like my mom made growing up. Last christmas I noticed it taking a little longer for cookies, but I was again able to make sufficient quantity.This year, I pulled it out, made the dough, and have been unable to get it to work. After about 45 minutes of pushing out the dough, I had about 15 cookies. The rod just will not push hard enough to get the dough out. This is very disappointing, and I will have to resort to cut-out cookies this year. Definitely buy another product."
1,no power,"I recently purchased this because I needed something with some power as my arthritic hands can't use the manual ones. I started to compress the button and it runs real ""fast"" but once it hits the dough, it cranks so slowly to almost stopping. They say to hold button for 2 sec and then release. I had to hold the button for 15+ sec at a time before the dough made the shape onto the sheet. I now have purchased an electric one and boy I should've just trusted my instincts and bought it the first time. This company has a terrible product and furthermore they add insult to injury for charging $30 for it. Don't buy this product. Save a few pennies and purchase an electric one or the regular manual ones that work 20x better than this product."
1,A JOKE of an appliance,"I cannot believe what a WASTE of money this thing was. HUGE disappointment. I was all excited when I got it, made some cookie press dough, put it in, and... nothing. The plunger pretty much spins in place. I could PUSH the dough out manually faster than this thing can. I couldn't even get ONE FREAKIN' cookie out of it, onto the cookie sheet.DON'T buy this sorry excuse of plastic waste, and if you do, don't say you weren't warned. I probably would have more constructive criticism, but #1 This product isn't worth the effort, and #2 I spent ALL effing evening saying to myself, ""It CAN'T be this bad. It must work somehow."" Ummmm... NOPE!!!!"
1,Awful product! Waste of time!,"For years I used my mother's cookie shooter to make my holiday spritz cookies. When I bought my first house I wanted my own cookie shooter. Boy, I wish I hadn't purchased this one.The first time I used it I thought, ""It shouldn't be this hard to use or take this long!"" But I was using it correctly. The motor is SO WEAK! My biggest grip however is with the threaded rod that twists to push the dough out. The rod has an indentation all the way down, so when it's twisting, it constantly skips back up and never eventually pushes the dough down the tube. If I do get a cookie out of it, it's misshaped and took at least 30 seconds to get out.What a piece of junk!"
1,Don't Waste your Money,"I bought this cookie press believing it would be better than the manual press I already own. However, there is not enough battery power to press the cookies out of the cylinders. It was impossible to get a cookie out of the large cylinder. The small cylinder was a little better but the cookies were broken.By the way, I used the cookie recipe included with the press plus fresh batteries. It was a HUGE disappointment."
1,BonJour Cookie Factory,"This product is the biggest disappointment. The first one we had to return to the mfg. because the motor did not work, at our own expense. Then the large barrel would not press out the cookie dough and the small barrel was slightly better. Save your money and make cookies the old way."
1,big disappointment,"I bought this contraption from King Arthur Flour. They said it would work, and I trusted them. I have tried making cookies with this thing a dozen or so times. Only three times were the cookies somewhat nicely shaped. The other times they were gloppy and I gave up.The motor is weak, the machine does not ""cut off"" the dough once it's pressed through, so it stays attached to what is in the tube. A big mess.Nor does it work well for frosting. This was a big waste of money. I bought it as a gift for my daughter, so it wasn't opened until long after I could have returned it. If I could have, I would have returned it. I should have opened it before wrapping it, and tried it out."
5,Great press and fantastic accessories!,"I've had another press for many years, but I couldn't get to it and had cravings for some Spritz cookies. So... I went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with. The press worked beautifully (I've only used the small barrel so far.) I was concerned that it was battery operated, my last one was a plug in model. But it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug. We had no problems with the unit, it worked quite nicely. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future. I would definitely recommend this press to anyone looking to buy a cookie press."
1,Do not waste your time/money,"I bought this cookie press last year to make Spritz cookies with my kids. I remember my mom making them with a hand held press when I was little, so I thought this battery one would be nice and quick to use. Last year, it was difficult to use, slow, and the cookies didn't come out of the press well. I thought I'd give it another chance this year. I took the press out of the box, inserted the batteries, and...nothing. This year, it doesn't even work...maybe that's for the best so I won't be dissapointed again. I'm going out now to find a manual press. Don't waste your time with this one. Junk."
5,Necessary accessory,Well made product -- nice lenses and a must have. The wallet is an especially handy and practical way to store them -- I've even put the step-down ring in the extra sleeve when I'm carrying the camera in one pocket and the lens wallet in the other. Only complaint: no lens cap to fit over them!?
4,Great light,"Great little light, just wish it came with the 110 connection so you don't have to use the 4 aa batteries when at home."
4,Great book light,"Great light for reading in bed, or dark places. Works well on paperbacks, or huge text books. Mine has a short in it. Sometimes it requires a flick on the light after turning it on to get the light to light up. Other than that its great"
4,Satisfied But...,... I've had my book light for half a year and use it most every night. And though the battery life isn't exceptional with rechargeable batteries it's not a big concern for me. But like other reviewers I find that more than half the time when I first turn the light on it doesn't come on. Sometimes it will come on in a matter of seconds. Sometimes it can take a full minute or even more. It's a nuisance to be sure and the manufacturer really needs to attend to this. But I'd likely buy another when this one finally gives up the ghost.
3,Won't light from time to time,"I bought this after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I haven't seen my problem mentioned. Every once in awhile, the light won't go on. I'll have to wait several seconds (haven't timed it, but it seems like forever) for it to start. It acts like a balky fluorescent light. With new batteries, it will light right up, but if that's the problem, the battery life is pretty bad. I have this problem about every other night.When it works, I like it very much, but I'm wondering if mine is defective."
1,Avoid this one,"I bought this book light for my grand daughter for Christmas, 2004. The product was defective--it simply did not work. That can happen with anything. But after six months of trying to get the company to make it right, I gave up, having received neither a new light nor a refund."
2,Defective?,"I've owned this booklight before and it lasted me 2-3 years with moderate use. The bulb finally gave out (it's advertised to last 10,000 hours) so it was a no-brainer to buy another one. This time it stopped working after 2 months of infrequent use. In the beginning, it seemed the cathode bulb was not as bright as my first one, even with brand new batteries. Then it would take several minutes to just turn on. Finally it won't turn on. Perhaps I got a lemon...so I'm going to return it to Amazon but I'm willing to try getting an exchange. I'm hoping it will work because it's the best booklight I've ever owned (I've owned the itty bitty light and the lightwedge)."
2,Very odd little light,"I have been through several book lights, I was hoping this would be my last. It's not. This light worked great the first couple times I used it, then after about the fifth time, it went wonky. If the overhead light is on, the booklight doesn't come on; when you turn the overhead light back on, the booklight comes on. Sometimes, if you rub the light where the bulb is, it will come back on. Most of the time it doesn't. Yet another book light for the trash can."
1,Phorm Light Voyager Book Light,"I had the same light for years and used it daily...and I loved it. When I broke my old light there was no question what light I wanted again. I have never been so disapointed in the second generation of a product before. It should be called ""The Sometimes Book Light"". Sometimes it works, most times it doesn't. Sometimes I fight with it to get it to work so that I can use it, most times I give up and use another brand's book light I have had to go and purchase since I bought this one.I would STRONGLY recommend that you Do Not purchase this product. I am ready to toss it in the trash, but I'm having trouble justifing throwing away something that cost me almost $30.00 that I have been unable to use because it does not do what it is supposed to. (It does work ok as a paper weight, but so does a rock I got for free from my yard). Be smart, do your research, find a different brand to buy. This product will only disappoint you!"
4,Phorm Booklight Review,"Best bedlight I have ever used. Even, white, soft fluorescent light easier to read by than yellow incandescent light of others. Packs well and is reasonably robust for traveling. Great battery life, too. Only complaint is that my wife still finds it a little bright in a darkened room."
1,Doesn't work consistently.,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Regardless of any good qualities, if I can't get the light to turn on consistently, it's of no use. Please see the other reviews about this problem. There is no on/off pattern to make it come on.Also, it's surprisingly bulky. I have another 4-AA book light that seems much less bulky."
4,A fantastic show,"I was intrigued when I saw the previews for this show and then I found out that it also is developed by Tim Minear (Angel, Firefly) and stars Nathan Fillion (Firefly, Slither). I've seen the first three episodes and I am hooked. If you are a fan of Angel, Firefly, Amazing Race, Cannonball, Cannonball Run, or Midnight Madness, you must watch this show. It has action, drama, suspense, exciting car chases, and a refreshing humor that you have troubling finding in many of the television dramas today. The premise is incredibly interesting and the show is well acted.My only problem with the show is that Fox will cancel it before it hits its stride. Oh well, I will enjoy it as I go."
5,"Well acted, written, directed, and Highly entertaining ...","This is a solid show, presenting a compelling situation that anyone could picture happening to them. So it has a clever premise. Then ... the editting is crisp and clean, introducing characters and laying the framework for the story while also displaying a multitude of different relationships. Lastly, convincing well protrayed roles presented clearly.All this adds up to a great show ....soon to be cancelled by TV execs."
2,is this the best new orleans has to offer?,"I dont get it. The only dope track is ""Who U Rolloin With"" but the lyrics aint tight."
2,"Consice review, but has typos","The book has a concise review of geometry. It lists about five to ten related theorems at a time, and then gives about two examples for each. This would be a good review of geometry for someone who is preparing for the SAT or GMAT if there were not so many typos. There are typos such has having the wrong diagram for a given question and listing questions that are not consistent with information in the associated diagrams.If you are learning geometry for the first time or expect difficulty in re-learning geometry, I would not recommend this book. However, if you need just a quick geometry refresher, then you can probably detect the typos without too much frustration and learn the basic theorems of geometry."
2,lethally dull,"i picked up this book just 4 the fin of it, 4 lil geometry problem drill. goodness, so so many mistakes were found. first of all, this book is only good 4 people who alredy know geometry, not 4 ppl who hope 2 learn sum of it by reading this book, cuz if i dint no geometry b4 pickin up this book, i would be at a complete lost. 2ndly, the book has made so many mistakes in answers and problem solving techniques that, again, if u dint no how 2 solve the prob b4hand, u would b at a complete lost. lastly, the book would overwhelm its reader with all its definitions, postulates, and theorems. only about 1/5 of the whole book is actually problem solving and the problems are not even that ""advanced"" to play around with, only the typical ones u would find in any geometry textbook. the book, in my opinion, dusnt even really deserve 2 stars, but i'm nice. :) (P.S. try the how to solve word problems 4 algebra 1, a much more better and thorougly ritten book)."
3,Temp gauge,It's ok. Not the quality I was hoping for but it works. I guess I was expecting more even though it was four bucks.
3,Length is inaccurate,"I was looking for a longer stem to reach deeper into liquids. The length of the stem is only 5 inches. The description says ""8.4 x 3.9 x 1.8 inches"", but that is the measurements of the package, not the product. The readable surface of the dial is 1.6 inches. Very easy to read, but I was really looking for a longer stem."
5,Insta-Read Is Great!,"I found this item in a thrift store many years ago, and it has worked great. I did manage to crack the plastic lens somehow, and it did appear miscalibrated. I took a pair of pliers, and comparing it to my other two thermometers of this type, turned the nut on the underside to the same temp. Presto, calibrated thermometer just like that! I love that it is soo much easier to read than my other one, which is about the size of a nickel. CDN IRL220 Insta-Read Large Dial Cooking Thermometer"
4,More accurate & faster-working than the smaller models I tried,"I really like the large size of the dial, which makes this thermometer easy to read. It's very quick to respond to temperature change, which is an important consideration for me. The needle skips a bit as it moves, but maybe that's because it's heating up so quickly (I pour hot water on it right from the teapot).It seems to be pretty accurate in the high numbers, which was important to me as I'm measuring temps for brewing coffee & tea. It appears accurate at room temperature too. (It doesn't measure below 60 degrees, so I couldn't test it in a slurry.) I did not have to adjust or calibrate for my purposes.There is a dimple about half way up the shaft which is where the temperature is apparently measured. You need to make sure this dimple is in the center of the food you're attempting to measure, in order to get an accurate reading."
3,Overdone,"When every interview has the same questions and the answers are about the same, it is not very helpful. ie. ""How Did you get started"", ""How long have you been doing this?"" What was your first job? Why did you leave? etc. I also feel that I paid too much -- $60 for a 10 year old book that originally sold for $19.95. That's an annual increase of almost 12% per year for the seller. What a deal for the seller, but not for me."
3,DW,"I tried this game for my son (11), and although graphically it is impressive, the vehicles seem to be very hard to control. Perhaps I didn't spend enought time with it, or don't have a good enough joy stick (I use the Microsoft Sidewinder). It does have very nice graphics though."
1,Overindulgent and Superficial,"I found the book to be superficial at best with the protagonist having no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The actions of the protagonist seemed to flesh out what has come to be mainstay in the gay culture: good-looking guy, not knowing what he really wants, playing the victim as he drifts from relationship to relationship. I pitied, more than emphathized with the character for leading such a hollow existence. I have a craving for a meaty Harlequin Romance novel after reading this book"
5,A Nice Surprise!,"Reading Mr. Patrick Johnson's book was a pleasant surprise. I did not expect the book to be so open and honest with the subject matter. Instead of glossing over the tough parts of the characters life, Mr. Johnson exposed his character. By making the character of Freddie so vulnerable, we were able to really feel for him. I think the book was painful for me at times only because I understand what it means to be the ""outsider."" Although I am not gay, I think feeling like you do not belong is something we all feel at times. Thanks!"
3,Polyester is petroleum based,"They make the case for not using plastic bags because of oil consumption but then they make the bag from polyester which is an oil based product. It makes better sense to use a recycled material instead of creating more waste with oily synthetics and when serving the US market, the cargo ship uses even more oil getting here from China.Sure, it's better than using disposable plastic but Chico can step up their green game."
3,"Pretty, But Uncomfortable","I love the look of these earrings. The size of the moonstone relative to the size of the garnet is nice. They dangle quite nicely, and I get many compliments on them. However, the staff - or loop, if you will - is a bit long in the back, and tends to poke my neck. If you are willing, or able, to overlook that fact, then these are great earrings. Quite elegant in appearance, and fun to wear!!"
4,Highlights Of The Later Years,"What the Amazon reviewer apparently didn't recognize is that this compilation isn't meant to be a career-ranging overview. Rather, it focuses on AWB II, the years when the band re-formed after breaking up. AWB I has been the focus of at least 7 different compilations at my last count. So, that compilation has been done to death. AWB II material has been released on a variety of labels (much of it hard to find), so its helpful to have the best of that material compiled onto a single disc. For the ""average"" fan that isn't interested in having it all, buy the two disc ""In The Beginning"" and ""The Greatest & Latest"" and you'll have everything that you need, other than ""You're My Number One"" from ""Cupid's In Fashion""."
5,Works great with Mac,"Seems to work well... no zapped computer yet. A few times on windy days it has taken over from line voltage, even when lights in the house stayed on and there appeared to be no actual change in supply. Macs recognize this unit immediately when plugged in via USB and have built-in settings for UPS in the Energy-Saver Preferences box. From there you can tell the computer what to do when the UPS takes over."
2,Software does not work with a standalone Mac,"This is a junky looking unit, from a design standpoint and it has an awful smell.Their tech support said the product and the software is ""Mac-compatible"" but it will not work with a standalone Mac (at least the auto shutdown software will not work).Mac users be warned.(Edit) - it should be pointed out that the hardware DOES work with Mac, but the more advanced software management tools that are sold as a feature of the device require a PC with different software installed on the same Network. You CAN use the OSX built-in UPS management software, but not the software that automatically closes programs, etc. But it DOES smell terrible, compared to the device I bought as a replacement."
1,"low quality, unimpressed","I've been very unimpressed with the quality of this keyboard, It took me a few weeks to get it out of the box and start to learn to type dvorak and when I did I noticed that the 'a' key was not always firing. It seemed intermitent under normal keyboard pressure, if you strike it very firmly it will type an a every time but otherwise you have to type it repeadedly. Sure, dvorak keyboards can speed up your typing, but not when you have keys that don't always work."
3,Interesting premise...,"I had never heard of Jung's theory of synchronicity and found the book intriguing--for the first few chapters. Then it became repetitious. But it is thought-provoking--just know when to quit reading! Actually, it has made me more conscious of coincidences around me (I've had quite a few recently with a name from the past mentioned, then getting e-mail from the person the next day). However, one could take the theory to the extreme and try to find meaning in EVERY coincidence, thus driving themselves and everyone around them crazy. The book never addresses this to my satisfaction."
1,I was so disappointed!,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. The first few chapters, armed with a yellow highliter, I tried to absorb all the definitions, etc. believing then that I could gain a lot of insight from this book. Unlike some of the critics above, I did complete the book because I kept thinking it would get better and there would be more. Most of his examples seem to be from his psychotherapist friends or acquaintances or people into this sort of thing. I would like to have seen more examples from average people. Also, his obvious ""gayness"" references to himself (some subtle, some not) kind of got in the way for me. A person could drive oneself nuts trying to read into everything that happens to you each day, even drawing unfortunate conclusions. No insights for the average layperson not schooled in all the theory that goes with this supposedly user-friendly book. All in all, a waste of time and money for me!"
4,Some good points,Great reading but not memorable. After reading this book I will definitely pause and not take for granted the little coincidences that occur in my life.
1,"I agree, a complete waste of time","I kept waiting for some analysis, some reason to read this book. However there is none. It is just endless random stories of this person meeting that person or getting this job. Waste of time and money. Apparently this jerk doesn't have enough respect or intelligence to write a book that can disseminate some real information. Save your money."
3,Good book for expanding possibility.,"The stories in this book are good tool for opening up your mind to the possibility of synchronicity, and therefore, the chance it might occur and when they do, that you will see it for what Hopcke thinks it is - an event that occurs during a time for chance that helps you come to a realization or decision, or altering of your life.As others have mentioned, it's bit reptative and thin - there are no excercises or 'techniques' for invoking synchronocity - but that's not Hopcke's purpose here."
2,I was unimpressed by this book.,"I found this book to be very repetitive and tedious. The first couple of stories are interesting, however the novelty quickly wears off due to the similar nature of the plots. The information in the book should have been condensed into a much shorter format."
1,Waste of time,"'Total crap', that's the summary of this review. I've expected a lot more from a Jungian psychologist. After good start and some reasonable examples the writer just keeps on explaining why the given examples are cases of synchronicity. The writer drivels on and on, eventually arriving nowhere... Like the other reviewer wrote: what's the point he's trying to make?If you're looking for an answer on how to recognize and make use of synchronicity, this is not the book, reading it will be a waste of time."
5,Works Great!,"This switch runs cool and has been very reliable. I've had one for a couple of years, and I'm coming back to buy another one for other network extension in my home. I've used various consumer switches (and hubs, at first) since they first came out about 15 years ago, and this one is my favorite."
5,D-Link 8-Port Gigabit QOS Switch DGS-108,Arrived on time and installation was easy.This is as easy install as you can imagine. Plug and play all the way.
4,works just as mentioned,"I bought this to cover up our BLUE alarm clock light. It did exactly as we wanted it to- toned down the blue light quite a bit- in fact, during the day you can't really read it unless you are close. However, at night, it is amazing how bright the blue light remains, although it is 100 per cent better than before. I will probably have to just replace the alarm clock at some point. The film itself clings and is easy to work with. I have a life time supply now."
2,Optical clearity is horrible,"Install was easy, but if you don't mind looking thru ""orange peel"", then this product will work for you. When I focus on something outside, it's really distorted. It's so unbearable that it's coming down. I've installed Gila tint on some of my south facing windows with great results, but I wanted something to peel off during the winter months, so I thought I'd give this Black Magic a try. I can't possibly see how the 5-star reviewers can tolerate this stuff. After buying this tint based on good reviews (along with other highly rated items on Amazon that turn out to stink), I'm seriously thinking that these good reviews are FAKE. That's right...made up just to drum up sales."
4,Good for the novice.,"I originally used this product to tint some windows in my house and while it cuts a lot harder than regular tint (you need scissors), it goes one really easily and doesn't kink like regular tint. I did two large replacement windows with two rolls of tint and I had enough left to tint the front windows of my SUV. This stuff is DARK! Looks totally black from the outside and inside I need to turn on my running lights in overcast weather to see my gauges. The view from inside is foggy as others have mentioned and is probably best suited for side windows that aren't used often."
3,Cling Film,"I like the darkness, but it is very hard to see out of at night. it did keep the Temperature down in my vehicle and make driving much more pleasant during the summertime here in Afghanistan. Had to remove it though because it would unstick and cause the back windows to jam when rolled down."
4,Very Good,I bought this to put on the window of my car. I cut out a large square and used it in the top portion of the window when the sun is really bright and pull it off when not in use. This is much thicker than permanent tint so not good for rolling down the window. It is still good after a dozen or so uses though is perhaps losing a bit of stickyness. The package has enough for probably 10 squares so this should last me a couple of years.
4,"Reduce your air conditioning bill, use this for temporary shade","I use this on my south side windows in summer with great results in cooling rooms. Fairly easy to install, to do a fine job of it you will need assistance. Remains in place all summer and is easily removed in winter. Reduces temperatures and reduces solar glare."
2,window tint film,The seller was fast on shipping and I would use again with no complaint but the product was a pain to apply without many air bubbles.I was using it on home windows so I wouldn't want to try oa a car.
1,trash,"i might as well have taken my money and threw it in the trash. do not buy this product, it simply doesn't stick"
1,"Where's the ""4 Pack"" ???","Okay description states that it is a 4 pack but I only received 1, if that was gonna be the case I would have never even ordered it!! Husband started cutting it to size for the window before I knew and it doesn't even stick well, keeps falling down. Very poor product and even worse description!"
4,works great!,"This product was super easy to install and looks great from the inside and the out side.I would just add one step to the application process.- Use a spray bottle and wet the entire window and the tint then once you apply it to the window you can adjust it and move it into place.- It kind of says to wash the window in soapy water but it doesn't talk about wetting the window in the application.It was super easy, clean, and fast"
3,"The product is fine, but it does NOT black out windows.","I ordered the tinting film because others had said they'd used it to black out windows in their homes. I wanted to create a very dark room for my one-year-old. The tinting film creates a similar effect to, say, wearing sunglasses, but it does NOT black out windows. I ended up going with card board.If you're looking to use the product as it's intended, to create a tinted window, it's fine. Fairly easy to put on, squeeze most of the air bubbles out, and take off. It would be hard to get it looking perfect, without small air bubbles, fitting the window just right, etc, but if you don't mind a few imperfections, this might do the trick for you."
2,Not a workable solution,"This may work for some, but after nearly an hour of work, I could not get an acceptable application. I tried all of the ""tricks"" but simply could not get the air and creases out of the tint."
3,a pain to install,"It's like trying to work with duck tape off the roll...this stuff sticks to itself like crazy..I had to cut it down, after unrolling it and discovering my window is an odd size. So many bubbles and creases after I finely got it on the windows...even after my attempts to smooth-en it out. This looks ugly up close, but from distance, it looks fine. Maybe I did something wrong in installing it, but it was quite a project. It does darken my bedroom window quite well, so I am satisfied, as long as my landlord doesn't say its ugly and has to be removed."
5,good product,i been looking for this for a long time..my man has bad eyes he cant deal with bright sun light comming in my house. it works great for us.
5,Great,"It's not perfect but it is great. I put it up about 6 months ago, no problem at all even during the cold winter. It stayed up no problem.REMEMBER...put it up with water and soap and not dry!Minor...minor bubbles but it you want perfect then go to a window tinting place!"
1,"This is only for ""1"" not ""4"" like it says.","EDIT: They changed the description, it no longer says 4.I ordered this instead of another larger named brand as it says you get ""4"" of them, so I figured it was worth a look.I ended up sending it back as I only received 1 not 4 and I would not have chosen this brand if it said it was only 1."
1,"Doesn't leak-- doesn't provide water, either!","I've been trying to find a water bottle that doesn't leak for months now. This one features a spring loaded ball stopper, and therefore doesn't leak.Unfortunately, the spring also prevents ANY water from being released. After licking the thing non-stop for several minutes, my ferret finally had her head face down in the drip pan underneath it. When I returned her leaking original water bottle to the cage she sucked at it for for almost five minutes, obviously thirsty, despite having access to this water bottle all day!Do NOT get this water bottle for your pet. I would rather lose a couple of drops to a drip pan every few minutes than let my ferret go all day without water. I'm just glad that I gave it to her on a day when I could be home to monitor her water consumption."
1,Cracked and easily chewed through - Not a good product for Chinchilla owners,My chinchilla apparently hated this bottle as much as I do now. I woke up to find an empty bottle and the bottom of the cage filled with water. A crafty chinchilla will be able to reach through the cage bars and chew a crack in this plastic bottle.
1,didnt work and leaked really bad,"nothing really to say about it, not a good product leaks very bad and i would like a new one sent to me that actually works and dont leak really bad"
3,No leaks but difficult to use.,"After getting fed up with leaking bottles, I bought this one with the spring-loaded ball bearing. It does not leak. The bracket that attaches to the wires doesn't look very sturdy. My big problem is that my rabbit's tongue isn't strong enough to get it to work. He worked at it for about 5 minutes, and only two bubbles came up. He is used to the double ball bearing variety, so it isn't an issue of training. I put in a dish of water, and he guzzled it after ""drinking"" from this thing for five minutes. This may work well for a large breed of rabbit, cat, or dog, but I wouldn't reccomend it unless you buy it locally. That way it can be easily return if it doesn't work for you. I guess I'll buy the water buddy."
1,Non Stop leaking ... DO NOT BUY!,"Well, I am on my second of these. The first one I bought I thought I had a flawed one because it never stopped leaking, so I went and bought another one of these only a larger size (the 16oz). Needless to say, it also dripped so bad that within about a half an hour my rabbits cage was a mess and he had no water. I do not recommend this brand at all, I am very very disappointed in this product, as it's the only water bottle I can find that attaches to a smooth surface."
1,LEAKS,"I've purchased 2 of these style bottles in hopes of getting one that would not LEAK! Both suffer the same problem the water leaks out. We have Chinchillas and will fill the water up in the morning to come home and find that all the bedding is wet and the water has emptied out. We've taken to putting a small container in the bedding tray underneath the water bottle to capture the water so the bedding stays dry. Needless to say we are going out this day to purchase a third water bottle, not made by this brand."
2,Michelin Map Review,I purchaed this map for an upcoming trip to Germany. The map is very accurate and easy to use
2,Depressing book!,"It seems to me that this book was overstuffed with one disaster after another. I was looking for a good Christian book to read at night before going to sleep, I didn't want something was full of all kinds of world problems from 9-11 to HIV. The book was a gift. Knowing that I read many Amish Christian authors my sister thought I would enjoy this. I didn't. Maybe I have just read too many other Christian authors and this one was too different for me. In my opinion the Smalley Relationship Center should have done their own book if they needed this much drama in a Christian book. BJ"
2,Disappointed by this Christian novel,"I admit, I didn't read the first two books of this series. But I really didn't need to. The author spends a whole lot of time reminding you of past events. Also, I'm amazed that this family is so messed up. I understand we live in the real world, and we're all sinful, and people make lots of mistakes, but come on. I bought this book because I was interested in reading some Christian fiction (I'm more partial to Georgette Heyer and Jane Austin myself), and well, I came away disappointed. Back to regency novels for me, I guess."
5,Return,Great Book. Easy reading. Lots of valuable lessons to be learnt. Very emotional book. Makes you feel closer to the Baxter family.
4,Return,"As always, Karen Kingsbury brings the Baxter family into our home with all the trails of everyday living and through it all she shows how living for God and believing in Him can see us through the valleys."
5,Return - Redemption Series,Karen Kingsbury is an excellent writer. I finish one book and can't wait to start another. My mother-in-law introduced me to her books and I want to read them all.
5,Return review,"As always, Karen's books are hard to put down. The Redemption series deals with the everyday problems that ""real Christians"" face and gives each of us a new perspective and outlook for the outcome. I have finished all 5 of the Redemption series and will be starting the Firstborn series as soon as my husband lets me download another book on my Kindle - I AM SO HOOKED!"
2,soap opera time !,"read the first two books, by the third it hit me that this is nothing more than a soap opera with cardboard characters crying all the time, with one thing after another happening. And as in a soap opera these books are populated with beautiful women and handsome men who are talented, successful, seem to have much disposable income--(a convenient plot device---the characters can jet all over the place without fear of cost , the doctors can clear schedules like nothing, etc). Landon and Ryan are pretty much the same character. and i can't stand it when an author becomes smitten with certain phrases----if i read about another character pinching the bridge of his/her nose , sitting down and placing their elbows on their thighs, splaying their hands on their chest, etc i will scream !"
4,Nice Family Saga,Karen Kingsbury series are a fast read and the characters seem so real. I like the way she captures your attention and doesn't waste time on a lot of description of the surroundings.
4,"Easy to use, hard to read","It's a pretty simple thing to weigh something, so no elaborate review here. Weighs in grams or ounces, plastic bowl is dishwasher safe. The one downfall of this scale is that the bowl is in the way of getting a direct view of the LCD screen, so it is difficult to read. The screen needs to be rotated more towards 90 degrees vertical or it needs to be back-lit. Had this for about 2 1/2 years now and only had to replace the battery once, and I buy a lot of stuff from Sams Club and use this to portion it out before I vacuum seal it."
4,very accurate,"It is very accurate. At first it seems as if it is hard to read. But, once you realize where all the digits are you can read it fine."
1,Get something else,This scale was far from what we expected. The display is difficult to read and it stopped working after just 2 weeks of very minor use.
2,Dead on arrival,"This seems to be a common problem among Denon recievers. After I spent an hour hooking it up, it had no display light. Nothing would light up AT ALL, So you had no idea what buttons you were pushing. My buddy got a better model and he had the same problem. I love denons, but I would recommend buying one in a local store, not online. It took 3 weeks for a refund."
3,historical value,"Poetry is a means of understanding the human aspect of history. Pure history books do not illustrate the lives of the people. Great ballads are written in every culture to document the world that evolves around the common man. They also develop into tall tales which I feel is also valid on a cultural level. Contrary to the belief of many Americans, John Wayne was not the first folk hero in history. Francis James Child has collected a group of British ballads. These ballads give one an overview of British life through the ages. This is an abbreviated version of Childs collection. That is unfortunate since there is a wealth of great material that was cut from the ranks. Still ballads like Bonny Barbara Allen and The Unquiet Grave are glorious examples of folk poetry. I would reccommend this book as a beginner course. I hope to get my hands on a copy of the full collection. These ballads are classic components of English language literature."
5,Biscuits and Scones,I was looking for a cook book on scones and was quite pleased with the variety of recipes because this was mostly scones. This is just what I wanted.
3,"Good recipes, needs better index.","Has good sounding recipes. Anxious to try the creme fraiche recipe. However, when I went to the index just to look for scones, I found that scones were mixed in with all the other recipes, and you need to know the name of the one you're looking for. A list of all the scones in one place would be much more convenient. Do intend to try some of the recipes."
5,The most thorough pictorial book on plants that's out.,"I have the Series 3 Seventh Edition. It is the best pictorial book on identifying plants that is out and if you are so lucky to purchase one, you will be envied by your fellow gardners. They are scarce and those who have these books treasure them and do not give them up."
3,Can a Title Make an Album? Perhaps So.,"All these are remakes, some of the singers voices have changed more than the others, and some of the special sound effects of the hit versions are missing. Nevertheless, this has been popular at water aerobics (most participants are AARPers) for the last several sessions. Perhaps its popularity is due to both the album's catchy title (Women's Lib) and the songs selected."
4,Wonderful,I purchased this for my niece who loves the color pink and ladybugs. She was so delighted with it sheclung to me all day. Wonderful workman ship. A must buy for anyone who loves ladybugs and the color pink.
5,Refreshing music.,"A refreshing mix of pop and Indian music, much different than what Bally Sagoo et al provide. The blending of the two different kinds of music as well as of English and Hindi lyrics is smooth and sounds natural. Anu is a very talented artist. Good work, I am looking forward to more music from him."
1,badly written book,"This book is bad, and thats it. The author does not teach java but her own java gently class, that has errors. Most of the examples dont work, and for first year students it is a waste of money.Dont buy this book, get a free ebook on java or use the api from sun."
1,Would give 0 stars because I don't even like the elephants!,"I am currently enrolled in a Java course and because I hadn't programmed in a while, I bought this book in addition to the textbook, as a reinforcement. The textbook was trash, as I expected . . . and as most are, but this book just compounded the problem. I thought I was deficient of the necessary brain cells needed to grasp new concepts after reading Java Gently. It wasn't until I read the comments on this page that I realized it wasn't me, it was the book! I have (rusty) HTML/XHTML and C/C++ experience, so I'm not even a complete novice and still this book made a relatively easing programming language (from what I hear) a lot more confusing. I bought this book used and still feel ripped off.Bottom line . . .DO NOT BUY JAVA GENTLY!!!!"
1,APC - Short Term Garbage,"I bought the APC BE325 for a single small computer located away from the rest of the computer equipment in an out of the way area. Even though there had been no power failures, the APC failed outright within 10 months. Battery will not hold a charge no matter how long it is charged with nothing plugged into it. Never again.Have had much better luck with the CyberPower CP850AVRLCD."
2,Nice neighborhood transport with no range.,I was looking for an electric scooter that was able to travel a fair distance.. and decided to go with the stealth S1000 as they advertise a decent double digit range to it... and I'm regretting it.. I barely get 2.5 miles out of a sinlge charge and can not even make the 3 mile commute to work like I was hoping be able to accomplish.. I lose 1/3 of my power doing 2 laps around my neighborhood. I thought this would be the electric scooter that got me by.. but looks like I'll be in the market for a gas scooter. and FYI I weigh in at 150lbs.
4,"not bad, just small","I got this for my six year old boy because he loves putting things together, and the Titanic is his new obsession. I knew it was going to be small seeing as how it is on a scale of 1/1200, but I didn't realize just how darn small that was until it came. The ship itself, once constructed, is no longer than the length of a woman's small hand. Any of the pieces that were to put together were way too tiny and his grandfather had to do most of it. So it wasn't the success I had hoped for. He still plays with it, but it is too small to appreciate any of the details, and we found a much larger version that he got for Christmas and that one is much for interesting for him to play with. I wouldn't say this was a bad item, just not good for a young child who loves details and wants to do it by themselves."
3,Revell Titanic Model,"Product was smaller than I had anticipated. Size of 1/12 was given but for me it did not tell me much as I dont work models. However, My Grandson being a titanic fan will love it as a gift for his birthday. Delivery from this company was excellent."
4,Good reading to add to the stack of nightstand books.,"Good reading to add to the stack of parenting books one reads. Easy to get through and to the point. Very encouraging was the Effective Parent vs. the Perfect Parent chapter. A great reminder that the best you can do IS the best you can do, so do it!"
5,A BEAUTIFUL Transition bible from storybook to adult bible,"This is a perfect storybook bible for children who have outgrown the cutsie little children's storybook bible like ""The Beginners Bible"", but who aren't quite ready for a full blown NIV bible, or even an NIrV. The watercolor style artwork is stunning. There is artwork on every page. The stories are short enough to keep my 1st grader's attention, but long enough to give more detail than the simple preschool / kindergarten bibles. I am super pleased with this book and see it being used for a few more years before she transitions to a big girl bible. Perfect for elementary age kids."
4,Lovely artwork,"I got this bible for my God Daughter, and I think she will love it.The artwork is whimsical and enchanting, and the verses are in language that is easy for a child to understand."
4,Great Children's Bible,"Splendid pictures and an excellent text. We gave this as a baptism gift to a seven year old baptized on Easter Day. It is a book which will last her for a number of years. It is colorful, the Bible stories are well told and there is interesting background information too."
4,Strong entry among children's Bibles,"I appreciated the clear and appealing writing style as well as the attractive illustrations in this book of Bible stories for children. However, it is not free from additions and interpretations as some reviewers have written. The author adds non-biblical details in order to make the stories more interesting and these details affect the reader's interpretation of the stories. This may be disappointing for buyers looking for unbiased retellings of the stories."
3,Influence Recycling?,"This is strange to say, but Walker sounds as if he's imitating Bryan Ferry on this album. Of course, Walker was originally a huge influence on Ferry, which creates an odd feedback loop. It's comparable to the way blues guitarists such as Freddie King attempted to update themselves by imitating the rock guitarists who had originally learned to play from them. At any rate, the Ferry-ish mannerisms are so distracting that it's difficult for me to fully appreciate his singing here."
3,OK Watch OK Price,"Can't complain too much, did not spend much at all. It is HUGE so make sure the wearer has a large wrist or it looks out of place. Also, you can see in the picture if you look closely, there is clear cheap looking plastic on either side of the dial and strap. If they would take that off the watch would be much better looking!"
2,Nikon Coolpix Lens Cap,"It's tiny and it doesn't have a cord attached. But it covers the lens. If you lost yours, get a new one AND ATTACH A CORD to it. Nikon was foolish to leave this feature out."
5,Mary Wells CD Review,Mary Wells Motown songs are hard to find. I was pleased to find it here and pleased with the CD itself.
2,Inexpensive but too limited; better choices available,"Mary Wells' story is well known to Motown fans. The first soul diva and Motown breakthrough, she was at the height of her success (My Guy) when an offer for a big advance - not matched by Motown Pres Barry Gordy - lured her away. The short, sad story is that she never achieved such success again.Her release history also is checkered. Motown/Universal have released many best of sets that I know of, and there are others from Europe. Motown/Universal compilations include ""Looking Back"" (Motown Masters Series, 1993, 2CD, 43 cuts; ""The Ultimate Collection"", 1998, 24 cuts; ""The Millennium Collection"", 1999, 11 cuts; and ""The Definitive Collection"", 2008, 18 cuts.This one, ""The Millennium Collection"" is inexpensive, but is totally hits focused and misses the better sides of Ultimate or Definitive, or the mother lode of Looking Back.Wells is so good at what she did that I have to rate this one as not worth the time or (even though cheap) the money."
5,out standing,i am trying to capture the 60's sound. mary well;s addition to my collection was is outstanding.amazon keeps amazing me i have found every thing iv looked for and more .i am hooked amazon is the place to shop. keep up the great job.
5,enjoying mary wells,she has a lovely voice and her songs can be enjoyed by all age groups. and looking at her biography could be a lesson to us all health wise.
2,Not Worth The Money,"I was really disappointed with this workout; the exercises are very common and not done with great form. Plus, the instructor is wasting time by stopping to drink water and wipe his face."
5,A discourse of winged words,"It's difficult to credit the grace and dignity of language which Mssr. Reppen brings to this strategy guide. The wealth of intelligence and tact which he bring to the task of describing Independence War is normally reserved for the finest of cathedral architects. A paean to you, fine craftsman."
4,interesting facts about the state of Rhode Island,"I thought this book was very interesting. It showed pictures and a small map of the state. It talked about its attractions, history,where its people work, protecting its environment, and interesting facts.The Hello U.S.A. series is interesting to read.So is the One Nation series."
3,Love Aint Suppose to Hurt,"It was okay, a little funny, had some kind of spiritual interpretation going, would not buy it again for me or anyone else"
4,Excellent!!,"I believe this is one of Shaun Jeffrey's earlier works and, since I read the three of them (chronologically anyway) out of order (as I understand it, from newest to oldest), the beginning did SEEM to reflect that fact. But, I could be wrong. The novel, overall, after the first chapter for sure, was very satisfying and, in my humble opinion, begging for a sequel. I can happily say it was well worth the purchase!!Sincerely,J.G. Franklin"
4,Creepy read...,"First, I must say that my impression of this story is probably influenced by the fact that I did everything the wrong way round, reading Shaun's first novel last... So I'm used to faster-paced stories, which gave me the impression that this one started a bit slow. But then on the other side, I got really confused with what was going on, same as the character, and I'm just wondering if that was the reason why and maybe that was just a way of setting up the ""atmosphere.""I really liked the idea behind the story, all that weird-science stuff is actually pretty scary... There are definitely a few points that make you think... Erm no, I'd rather not think about them actually !Eventually the book did pick up, and I was so glad that it ended just the way I like a story to end ! (won't say anything else other than I'm not into the fluffy fairy kind of stuff)...Although I didn't have a blast like I did with Shaun's other novels, I did enjoy this creepy read !"
4,Works OK but slow,"This thermometer works well but is slower to repsond as compared to a previous digital version I owned. The nice feature is it's easy to clean and no batteries required, bad side is it takes about 30 seconds to a minute to get to a true temperature if you use it for spot checking. Its OK, serves the purpose."
1,Worthless,Thermometer worked fine on Thanksgiving turkey but clearly malfunctioned the second time it was used. Roast would have been burned to a crisp had I believed the thermometer instead of the cookbook. Save you money and buy something else.
3,Broken Already,"I had a meat thermometer for 40 years and the glass finally broke so I thought I would order another one. This one came in quickly and looked rather like the old one. The price was great but the first time I used it, It broke. I guess I'll have to look for an old one."
1,Junk,"Never worked. I used it the day I got it..didn't work, the next week..didn't work. Tried a third time and it cracked...(without working). Junk, Junk, Junk. Get something different...your roasts will thank you for it."
4,Meat and poultry thermometer,Have not used yet but I believe it will be a good addition to my cooking!
2,Foggy Glass,I ordered this for 2010 Christmas. We moved soon thereafter and finally used it it March 2011. The face is now cloudy as of June 2011. Neither one of us remembers cleaning it by immersing the head in the water. We do keep all our grill equipment outside and we are in Texas...Lisa
5,"This is the future of music, Fawn Liebowitz is now. . .","After having listened to the album about 500 times, I feel confident that my opinion is without question, valid. Fawn Liebowitz's album, ""Loyalty"" conveys a depth of musical range, emotion and style unparalleled in the contemporary music scene. From the opening bars of ""Big Trees"" to the final note of ""May 12, 1998"", Fawn Liebowitz takes the listener to a myriad of sounds and images. This is the best album I have heard since ""Abbey Road"" by the Beatles."
1,short and sour,"This book is awful. Why? Because it does not teach you Iron Palm. The Author should have looked up the word ""complete"" in the dictionary. If this is ""Complete"" Iron Palm, then why write another book called ""Advanced Iron Palm""?? No matter what, after I read this book I realized my palm will never be iron but I think my brain is possibly iron because I was so stupid to buy this worthless piece of nonsense."
2,Iron palm ? Yes.. Complete? No way!,"This is a very small book, but it does cover a lot of conditioning methodes, and is an interesting read in that respect. So to keep this short: This book is good on what it covers: Conditioning! But in no way complete. The information it contains is worth absorbing, but personally i did not like the style that it was written in."
3,Not a bad beginners book.,"Well first off I want to say that this book is okay for a beginner who knows nothing about Iron Palm. It does explain some techniques and gives some ideas as to why it was so secretive for so long. It also shows some chi kung / chi gung / breathing exercises.Con, it shows only a few chi kung exercises, only few Iron Palm drills, and summarizes how breaking plays a role in Iron Palm.However, it does have general commentary that I found to be helpful for people who might not know about Iron Palm.Bottom line, this book should have been labeled Iron Palm for Dummies, or better still Beginners Iron Palm, but complete? I bought this book to get an idea of how other Sifu / Shih Fu and other schools practice and what kinds of chi kung postures they use, but instead I have an Iron Palm 101 book, so if you are looking for a place to start this would be it, if you are looking for something that shows how other schools might differ in training or exercise, this book isn't it."
1,Iron Palm without ki or chi,"If you are looking for internal power techniques, like DOKU TE and DIM MAK, don't by this book. The techniques it's only to increase the fisic resistance from the hands/skin. You will not learn how to do a punch in a brick and break something behind it."
4,Spanish Johnny's Pop Opera A Huge Success,"Spanish Johnny's Opera craft ultra-literate, sophisticated, aurally exciting song-stories. A pop band that has completely side-stepped that initial phase of trying to get people to shake their asses, SJO has moved directly to the songwriting phase--and it's a bold and important first record. Using strings and cello, mostly clean electric guitars, minimal but dramatic drumming, and a vocal styling that lands somewhere between Freddy Mercury, Elvis Costello and Roy Orbison, this is a band that demands being LISTENED to. There will be no dancing to Spanish Johnny's Opera! But the rewards of careful attention to this music will certainly make up for the deficit."
5,Simple and Elegant,"In order to appreciate the music of SJO you have to listen to it, I mean really listen to it. Every aspect of this CD seems like it was put together with a purpose in mind. The lyrics are thoughtful and poetic, the music soft and smooth. This is not your average flavor of the month pop music. I highly recomend this CD to anyone looking for some music with brains."
1,Ick.,"I wouldn't normally post such a negative review, but I got a solicitation e-mail promoting this album, therefore I feel it is appropriate.Apart from the horribly whiny, out of tune, and quite untolerable vocals... Apart from the bludgening of the senses by the cello and violin, neither adding any mood to the music because of both their volume and repetitiveness... Apart from the pathetically poor songwriting... This album is not that bad...I would actually rather listen to a blank CD than have to go thru that experience again."
2,gross remix of MJ Blige,"almost like a bad dragqueen imitating the sista Queen!!!!otherwise, it's ok fun."
1,boo...Boo...and BOOOOOOOOOO AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Amazing voice, ridiculous and sub par songs...they just gave her anything so she could have an album. They could've given her the dictionary to sing....it'd probably sound better....highly disappointed in the ALBUM not the VOICE! Better luck next time...hopefully by then they'll have found her some truly talented writers & producers...management, STEP UP YOUR GAME AND STOP WASTING TALENT ON MEDICORITY!!!!"
2,Run-of-the-mill pop throw away,"Saw the album in a store today. almost bought it. So glad I didn't. Just listened to all the samples here and for the most part it's trash. Paris was my favorite singer in American Idol - a performer with enormous talent, star quality, and impressive vocals that left the hairs on my back standing. This CD is basic ""corporate"" cookie cutter R&B/pop garbage - sung today forgotten tomorrow. It does nothing to showcase her soul, spirituality, and emotions. Trite lyrics from someone who has much to share even at the tender age of 18. Paris' handlers need to do a better job of picking her songs. It would have been nice to hear some stuff along the lines of say crystal waters, ce ce peniston, mary j blige etc. What we have here is one of the worse CDs I have ever heard. but I still have faith in Paris, once they let Paris be Paris!"
1,ummmmmmmm..,"I've just been listeningi to the samples and I'm not with the exception of the two last songs. (with her grandma and friends) I can't believe this cd is by the same person that blew us away on American Idol week after week. Her grandmother is the one and only Ann Nesby. I mean, really! I know she's young and all of that but she should have gotten better record producers to help her out. First impressions are everything."
1,A Big Disappointment,I believe that her voice would have been better served on traditional R&B; tracks. I was disappointed that she didn't reach back to her Gospel roots.I not convinced that Princess P will not be a 1 CD wonder like other's American Idol Contest that won or perhaps didn't win the competition. I see her falling out of the lime light like Diana 2nd runner up to Fantasia.
1,Paris Bennet review of CD,"What happened? The tracks are horrible. I expected so much more. This young lady has a voice, and somehow it was lost in the production of putting this CD together. Fire the producers."
1,Terribly disappointed,"Like so many others, I loved Paris on AI. Only today did I finally hear her 1st CD and cannot tell you how disappointed I was.Commonly, I am disappointed in the 1st release by ex American Idol contestants, but this was the worst ever.I will not bother to go song by song as they ranged from a simple ""OK"" to completely horrid. When I looked on Amazon this morning, I see that there are 34 new and 25 used available from $.01. Even if you did not have to pay shipping and handling, it would be overpriced. I am giving this a rating of 1 only because a 0 is not available."
3,MINNEAPOLIS WHERE U AT?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HOW IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS REASONABLE COULD THE PEOPLE MANAGE THIS INCREDIBLE TALENT NOT HOOK THIS GIRL UP WITH JIMMY JAM & TERRY LEWIS OR PRINCE OR JERMAINE DUPRI!!!!!!!!!! HELLO!!!!! HER GRANDMAMA IS THE ONE & ONLY ANN NESBY (SOUNDS OF BLACKNESS)!!! AMERICAN IDOL IS A CURSE TO REAL TALENT THIS DISC WAS SLAPPED TOGETHER WITH NO CONSIDERATION FOR THE ARTIST. PLEASE PARIS DUMP YOUR MANAGERS & PRODUCERS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!! YOU ARE THE BOMB, BUT IF YOU CONTINUE THIS PATH YOUR CAREER IS OVER. KATHERINE MCPHEE!!!!!!(YUCK!!) TAYLOR HICKS!!! ( WHO???!!!!!), GET IT TOGETHER GIRL AND DO THIS RIGHT!!!!!"
3,Worse than expected.,This is the big difference between being signed by a big record company and a small one. Paris is pure talent and this prove otherwise. I am quiet dissapointed. She would have done better with a jazzy album and not hip hop album.
2,I hope she makes a second better album,"When I saw that Paris had made an album I was so happy because she was one of my favorites of the season she was in. But, after listening to the tracks, I am disappointed. Only a few of these songs are even good, not one is great. All of the songs could have been great had she chosen better.I was also happy that she had a song with Kevin in this, as he was another favorite of mine, but that song was not good. Maybe he could come out with an album too, only with good song choices."
1,Very bad,"The book takes you through chapter after chapter of methodologies for solving specific types of problems without teaching you any fundamental concepts first. And by ""takes you through"" I mean a page or two telling you why you need that chapter, a page or two of inscrutable, barely-explained formulas, and pages of impossible exercises that test you on material nowhere to be found in the examples.It's unbelievable to me how many errors there are in this book considering it's the eighth edition. When you're staring at the pages for hours trying to figure out how something works from the scant examples, nothing's worse than the suspicion that the book itself is wrong.Profs, do not require this book!"
3,Physical book quality review not necessarily material content,-Content was average.-It really didn't get me interested in statistics with the examples and homework problems.-Would have liked a real strong focus on the engineering side.I guess I can't say don't get this book if it is required for a class. Just know that if you do purchase it the actual quality of the book is terrible. What I mean by it is the binding is cheap and the paper quality is awful. Expect become loose in the binding throughout its use. My three (3) stars mainly came from the cheap glue and paper they used to put the book together and is not meant to judge the quality of content because I really was just trying to get through the class. For quality of material read the other reviews provided.
3,It's ok,Pluses:- Fairly easy to understandMinuses:- Lack of hard examples to help you with the hard exercises- Odd problems (with solutions) tend to be easier than even problems
3,Okay,"Listed condition was very good. Inside was in good condition. The front cover had a lot of micro-scratches, and the protective seal was peeling. The 3 stars due to the misleading condition label/lack of notation of the cover's condition."
2,Bad DVD,We were unable to get this DVD to work. We tried a couple of different players and each time we received a message about an error on the disc. Would it be possible to get a replacement DVD? We have seen part of this movie off our cable channel and would like to see the entire movie from start to finish.
1,fat joe sucks,50 Cent will kill fat joe ok? he said in XXL that he could beat 50 Cents azz . he gotta be crazy . I cant wait for tony yayo cd come out. fat joe is fat little nigga to me
1,This Came Out way too late,"damn crack, you should have realesed this album like 4 months ago whats with the delay, first of all, the singles on this album are OLD!!, So much more came out like 4 months ago, Lean Back Remix was so 2004 ago, and Hold You Down Droped 3 months ago. why would you release an album this late???? remember when the 50 cent piggybank beef occured? well why didnt you realease the album 1 month later??? you see the people and the fans were amped and hype and on your side and jadakiss side and you know everyone is like o gotta cop that all or nothing now gotta hear what joe gotta say, now the beef is damn ooolddd no one really wanna care about it no more so you know now there looking at your album like o who cares about fat joe...and for the album, its too weak to be called all or nothing cuz its got too much commercial songs on it. bottom line, album gets a 2.5/5, fat joe isnt a good at marketing his products, 50 cent at least knows how to make money."
1,Terrible,"This album is terrible to put it simply. There are a few highlights such as the Lean Back remix but that's mainly due to the presence of Em & Mase. I'm surprised Em didn't realize how terrible Fat Joe is and am surprised he's actually do a song with him. But overall this album is bad, he thinks he can outdo 50 and the G Unit crew but he doesn't stand a chance. [...]"
3,ALL OR NOTHING?,"HE NEEDS TO MAKE UP HIS MIND ON WHETHER TO GO COMMERCIAL OR HARDCORE.'MY FOFO' WAS HOT,HE SMASHED 50 CENT IN A VERY ENTERTAINING MANNER.OTHERWISE,THE TERROR SQUAD ALBUM WAS BETTER THAN THIS ALBUM."
3,YO HES HOT BUT 2 MUCH SONG 4 THE LADIES,YO FAT JOES HOT BUT MAN 2 MUCH SONGS FOR LADIES NO GANGSTA SH*T WHATSO EVA YE PROLLY A COUPLE LIKE TEMPTATION 1 N 2 AN THE INTRO AN DOES ANYBODY KNOW BUT THATS 4 SONGS OUTA 14 DOG THE FIFTY CENT DISS IS CRAZY BUT IT DONT MAKE YOU WANNA HEAR IT ALOT. IT GETS BOREING. ITS NOT THAT GANGSTA THE BEATS IS INCREDIBLE CRAZY.

I GIVE IT 4 STARS 4 THE BEATS AN 4 THE CLUB BANGERS BUT ON A GANGSTA LIST I GAVE IT A 2 FOR DA BEATS AN HIS WACK NON GANGSTA LYRICS. ITS REALLY ALL OR NOTHING AT THE SAME TIME JUST TAKE THE ALBUM BY ITS TITLE.
5,Luv it,This has been one of the best solo cds that the CRACK has had he keeps getting better and better everytime he releases something new...50 aint got nothing on Fat Joe 50 aint nothing but a sell out all that guy is in is for the money he has wack songs and lyrics all he talks about is murder money drugs i say take his music and take it back on the steet with all his wangstas...lol Well Fat Joe is the best and his real with his music always has and always will this cd is real hot everyone who is a Fat Joe fan or TS has to get this cd Best Song is So Hot with R.kelly Chi-town stand up baby..
1,All Or Nothing - Nothing,"Fat Joe is one of my least favorite artist. He sounds bad, names bad, everything is bad about him. There are a few good songs taken from other peoples songs with him. Hold You Down by Jenfier Lopez w/ Fat Joe is okay (I mean Jenfier Lopez is okay), Lean Back by Terror Squad w/ Fat Joe & Remy sucks, Terror Squad dosen't even say anything in the song. Lean Back is not on the album (thank God it would have made it worse) but the Remix is w/ MASE, Eminem, Fat Joe & Lil' Jon This song is hot (except for the part with Fat Joe I always skip that). And then Soo Hot w/ R. Kelly is good (again, not Fat Joe) but Kelly sounds pretty good (not as good as usual). Don't buy this album, don't download, don't even listen to it, it's a waste of time. And its not his fo-fo it's 50's fo-fo."
2,A victim of POP!!!,"Fat Joe are one of the artists that fell off. Back in day, he used to be a hard New York rapper. Now he's dadicated to the commercial so much that: 1. He blocked out some words of his album, even if you get the parental advisory copy, things like that holds back a mc. 2. He took out several songs off the album which I believe should've stayed for the album to be better. If Fat Joe called this album the he released, he's going to end up like Mase."
3,I thought this was a comeback album...,"I'm a Fat Joe fan from the early ninties. I honestly stopped liking Fat Joe just before Big Pun died. I heard the Just Blaze produced ""Safe 2 Say (The Incredible)"" and instantly thought that the recent beef with 50 Cent had jolted an awakening of the Fat Joe of the D.I.T.C. fame. Singles like ""So Much More"" and ""Listen Baby"" seemed to have confirmed this...but once I listened to the finished product I must say I was quite disappointed. This album fronts several lackluster pop anthems (Get It Poppin for example) and just plain awful songs (Hold You Down). For those looking for that raw NY street lyricist, wait until Nas or Jay-Z release their next albums or go underground and listen to Immortal Technique."
3,Could be better,"Fat Joe said himself that he likes to include soft silly sh*t to appeal to a cross over audience. Back in the day when he was still known as a killer and crack dealer on the streets of the Boogie Down Bronx he was spitting that fire. Back then someone like 50 opening his mouth would have resulted in some serious violence, but these days Joey Crack is too soft to wipe 50 out. It's not like Joe can't do it though; his freestyle skills have actually improved a great deal, but he needs to stop messing around with those soft tracks."
2,2&a Half tops,"Fat Joe stays steady,but He can be streaky.the problem is that He gets caught up in alot of trendy stuff that tends to wear where He is trying to go down.I was looking forward to the cut ""So Hot"" with R.Kelly.anybody working with the King of Music R.Kelly is always gotta get my ear&Attention,but the cut is alright at best.""Lean back"" had me hyped last summer&while the Re-Mix is cool the rest of this Album is decent enough to get by,but consider that Fat Joe is all the Hype on Him He didn't Bring that Knock Out album.had Fat Joe came with a stronger Album then Dude would have fully been on the first Tier of Rappers."
2,Weak,"Unfortunately yet another commercial aimed release from Fat Joe. Was really hoping for a hardcore release from Joey Crack, reminiscent of his early material, when he actually rapped with fire and aggression. Really not feeling this album at all, not that I was expecting to. Hopefully he doesn't bring this garbage for the upcoming D.I.T.C. project.If you like your commercial hip hop a bit harder then you might get some enjoyment out of this. If you are a hip hop head looking for something like J.O.E. then don't bother.And to all you 50 Cent fans, you really need to keep your mouths shut, as most of you are probably under 13 and have never heard of D.I.T.C. or Fat Joe's earlier albums Represent and Jealous Ones Envy. Listen to either of these (especially J.O.E.) and tell me 50 Cent is the better MC...50 Cent/G-Unit + Crunk = What is wrong with hip hop"
2,WARNING: A Waste Of Money!!!!!,"I am a long time Fat Joe fan since D.I.T.C and The Represent Album (1992) and I probably will always be a fan that is the only reason I gave this 2 stars. But All Or Nothing let me down, BIG time!!! He has the pop songs on the radio but the rest of the album was boring with lame lyrics. I swore Fat Joe was going to kill me with this joint after wackass, played 50 tried to diss. The Cool and Dre track Rock Ya Body was the only song I could appreciate! It would have been nice if Cook Coke Crack would have went back to his roots and used some Beatnut's production. Bring the underground back and leave all the glock carrying BS for the real G's. There's a reason he dropped Gangsta from his name!Oh and remember, 2-3 months from now you will not be bumping this CD. It's like a fade, here today gone manana!"
4,Yall are trippin,"Shits hot. Yeah.. its not like his old stuff, but thats what happens. Styles change and I gotta give it to Fat Joe, he's still got it. Ive had the bootleg virsion of this cd for months an its got a lot of the same stuff and i like it. Everything he relesed before (besides that poppin song) are still chill to listen to. The production on this cd is crazy, Cool & Dre, Timbaland, Just Blaze.. its dope. I dont even listen to mainstream hiphop and i liked this so if you dont like it, i recomend you pick up the new foo fighters or backstreet boys.Best Tracks:- Intro- Does Anybody Know- Safe 2 Say- So Much More- I Can Do U- So Hot- Beat Novacane"
2,All or Nothing?,"If i had to choose one, I would say nothing. This trash has more fillers than classics. I also feel I heard half the album before it was released. The top 5 Songs were:1. Lean Back (Remix) ft. Mase, Lil' Jon and Eminem2. Safe 2 Say (The Incredible)3. Get It Poppin ft. Nelly4. So Much More5. My Fo-Fo (50 Cent diss)This album shouldn't have had J-Lo's joint ""Hold You Down"". So Hot featuring R. Kelly is basically We Thuggin' Part 2 only it's a bad song. And oh yeah, you got a song on ya album that disses my man 50, but also got a song that features Eminem; that doesn't make any sense at all to me."
2,Commercial,"I picked up this album because I would follow Joe`s response to 50-cent`s diss(Piggy Bank). But now I know who will come out on top.Fiddy will, they have both gone too commercial, but Fiddy does it so much better. Joe`s lyrics are just as weak as Fiddy`s, and the only thing he is tryin to say is that he is ""Joe Crack"" Except from ""Temptation"" which is one of the better tracks.Joe talks about he is the one with the highest street cred, but why cause most of the songs are greasy songs; directly for MTV.I don`t even think the Star Producers does any good job. The fact that only ""Lean Back remix"", ""Temptation pt 1."", and ""My Fofo"" are good songs shows it all. They are real gangsta tracks and is what Joe does best.As an MC Joe can't even hold his own against Remy Martin, so when Eminem raps Fat Joe looks like a fat boy shouting for ice cream.Don't buy this album, especially not if u are Fat Joe fan."
2,What?!!?!,"To the previous reviewer, how in the world could you rank this album above Dre and/or Snoop's best albums? What a joke. This album wouldn't rank in the top 500 rap/hip hop albums of all time. Get real."
3,Not Great but Not Horrible...,"Fat Joe didn't make a dud with this album, and he didn't make a classic. What he did make is a album that has a lot of good songs but just can't quite make it to that extra level. Crack does an excellent job on some of the songs, like Temptation Pt 1 & 2. He tells an excellent gangster story on these two tracks and both are awesome. Also, My Fofo, a 50 cent diss, is excellent with the ryhmes, but Fat Joe doesn't seem all that into it. There are a handful of other highlights, but mostly this cd is a bunch of gangster tracks laced with a handful of colorful R and B tracks with a popular singer. I recommend this just to check out the highlights, but not for much else."
3,DiS WoUld B a HoT InStRuMeNtAl Cd LoL,crack is crack always gonna be always has bin........... his rhyme skills wont improve anytime soon........ personally i dont think hes that bad i think hes aight a few mo albums and he might just become good but this album is decent the beats are crazy/serious/insane w.e u wanna call it the beats is on point the points is so hot id by this instrumental cd ...... crack got a ear for the beats they 2 me saved dis album from being like any otha album there not crunk they a new sound/old school sound mixed in 1 and quite lovely mix i mite add
3,This Album Is Garbage,Everybody who gave this album over a 3 is retarded. Crack's lyrics and flow suck(very overrated)the only thing that saves this album is the beat production.
1,NO ALL JUST NOTHING,"SEE, WHEN I THINK OF GOOD MC'S I THINK OF 2PAC, DRE, UGK,ROYCE DA 5'9, EM, CASSIDY, GAME, G-UNIT, AND DMX.WHEN I THINK OF BAD MC'S I THINK OF WILL SMITH,WILL.I.AM., AND YA FAT JOE, POSSIBLY THE WORST RAPPER ONEARTH. A CD THIS BAD SOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE PUT OUTON THE CD SHELFS. I WISH THERE WAS A RATING LOWER THAN 1 STAR LIKE 1/1000000"
1,The blob has puked out another stinker,This music is so bad there is no word in the english vocabulary to describe how awful this is.This guy makes Jabba the hut look like a womens GOD
4,Impressed,"Fat Joe, after being shot down by an overated diss from 50, came back. ""All or Nothing"" impressed me with the various styles in beats. You know, lyrically he killed it. The commercial songs; So Much More was nasty no matter what style you like. Get It Poppin, aaaa, not my favorite but hey if the women like it... The beats, from Beat Novacane and Just Blaze were nice. Alot of people like My FoFo, it was decent, could've been better. Songs to listen to: Intro, Does Anybody Know(He murdered this sample), My FoFo, Rock Ya Body, and Beat Novacane."
1,50 Cent Vs Fat Joe: This shows you 50 won by a landslide!,"The only highlight on this album was the Cool & Dre production! Everything else was mediocre. Go to ""The Leak"" & hear it for yourself."
2,Fat Joke aka Joey Whack,"""That fat n***a thought lean back was in da club, my s**t sold 11 million his s**t was a dud."" 50 was 100% accurate with that line. This cd is one of the biggest wastes of beats ever. This s**t started when he made that song with ashanti a couple years ago and now he has gone full blown pop. Hold You Down might be the fruitiest rap song ever made, and this man has the nerve to say 50 is the fakest thug you ever seen? Anyone that thought fat joe was gonna come back hard after 50 called him out will be sadly dissappointed.T. Frisna and It Starts With A C - your cd reviewing privilages are officially revoked."
1,Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad...,This Album sucks xcept for the song My Fofo cuz it got nice beats and rhymes even if 50 cent is better but anyway dont buy this album G-Unit is better even if the song My Fofo is good.
1,A disgrace to Latinos.,"Fat Joe is a disgrace to latinos everywhere becuz he's been in the rap game for 20 years and only had one platinum album. All or Nothing shoud've been called NOTHING becuz it was so horrible. This should signal the end of a so-called rap legend that nobody cares about. Big Pun is rolling in his fat grave. The 50-Cent diss song ""My Fo-Fo"" was weak. By saying fo fo fo fo fo it sounds like he's telling the world how much weight he lost or how old he really is. If u like All or Nothing it means u have a problem. Cuban Link should be happy that he's no longer affiliated with Fat Joe. Edward James Olmos would be ashamed of how Fat Joe is disgracing the Latino Culture."
4,Pretty Good,"I would say that this book is nice, with many nice photos and descriptions of an operator's colour scheme."
5,Peace of mind,Replaced an old refrigerator and decided to get thermometer to test new refrigerator and my free standing freezer. I am happy with the results.
2,About 3 years,"I don't know about the accuracy. First the clip never allowed it to hang straight, then the clip fell off. It worked for about 3 years then the interior fell apart. It did not get knocked around. Since I don't like throwing junk in our the landfill trash, that is not near long enough to pay for the pollution it creates, so I am not happy with it. It has left me wondering if there is mercury in that thermometer. Probably, it isn't digital. ??"
1,WAS THIS THING INTENDED TO HANG,"it has metal clips on each end that look like they are intended to hold the thermometer to one of the racks in the fridge, however, it is not balanced and the front simply spins downward and falls off the wire racks."
5,Almost Perfect,"For what it does, this product is almost perfect. As the product description and other reviews have noted, it is an easy-to-read, oil-(not mercury)filled refrigerator/freezer thermometer. In addition to having large numbers, the refrigerator and freezer ""zones"" are clearly identified, and the temperature scales are provided in Fahrenheit and Celsius. It would be perfect if it had a better method of attachment. However, while the metal ""clips"" are not ideal for my refrigerator/freezer, I can't really suggest a ""universal"" improvement that would work for everybody. So I'll just give it 5 stars for functionality, quality of construction, and value - and leave it at that. BUY IT. From my research, it appears to be the best product of its kind on the market."
4,small and accurate,I bought the thermometer to make sure that my new side by side fridge showed the correct temperature on the readout on the outside of the freezer door. The new appliances don't have wire shelves so this item can sit on the shatterproof glass shelves. I found it to be very accurate and move it from the freezer to the fresh food area to check on the temps when I add items to either side. I would rate is 5 stars if it was larger and could read it without removing it from the appliance.
3,Works great but,"This thermometer seems to work well, although I don't have a second one to text the temperature against. The biggest thing is the clips are so narrow you can't clip it on things well. I should have looked more closely and bought one with a suction cup to stick on the wall. However, there are two options that I used that may work for you.1. Place the thermometer flat on a shelf, like the bottom shelf.2. Place the thermometer inside the middle drawer.I have mine in a drawer right now, since the drawer is clear I can look at it when I open the door.In short, the thermometer itself seems to work fine. The issue is the execution of how it attaches."
2,Funk and Junk,This compilation has too much filler. I miss the superb 'The Best of the Early Years Volume One.' Now that is a classic.
2,Read Ryzard's comments carefully,"He informs you that this set is not the legenday recordings of the last 6 syms made with the Columbia on Sony (on vinyl it was the Columbia label, now bought by Sony).With with recent news last night that M Jackson may be selling his Sony recording holdings, worth $1billion, we may soon see the Walter/Columbia recordings released eventually.Its the Columbia SO set you want to own.I got my cd set from a used dealer in england 3 yrs ago, its on Sony/germany, release 1989.See my comments on the Bohm/Berlin complete.I'm back with another comment.I have just completed a compare between Bohm and Walter/Columbia.I have to give the nod to the Bohm, ....but then there are times I give the nod to Walter/Columbia...hummm, as with all Mozart, he is Hermes par excellent, and that mercurial quality is reflected in mere mortal attempts at capturing atht genius from another realm."
2,Lackluster and disappointing remix album,"As much of a White Zombie faithful as I had been, and as much as I may have liked ""Hellbilly Deluxe"", I can't help but cringe just a little bit whenever I hear anything off this remix album or any of Rob's newest material. These supposed remixes don't sound all that different from the original recordings, and while they do have their moments here and there, other times they can be just plain annoying. Plus, there are no kinds of extra bonuses (like White Zombie's cover of ""I'm Your Boogieman"" on the ""Supersexy Swingin' Sounds"" remix album), and at the full list price this looks like a blatant [copy]. Do yourself a favor, stick with the old White Zombie albums and even ""Hellbilly Deluxe"", and leave this, along with ""Sinister Urge"", in the dust."
1,For the love of god why??!,Was this album necessary? Why on earth would Rob want to waste time with a re-mix album instead of writing new material. He should just stick to metal like the old White Zombie material instead of putting out trash like this. Rob Zombie has never been about cheezy techno music so why even start? Overall the album itself is garbage. Any true fan of techno with think this has amatuer written all over it and metal fans should aviod it like the plague. The only real good thing about it is the artwork inside. Too bad thats not the price of admission....
5,great- for a remix album,"i usually hate remixes, but this is cool, especially the first track(dragula remix), the living dead girl mix is great too, but im still waiting on new material rob."
5,The Zombie's most underrated album,"Okay sure, It's just a bunch of remixes, but why not enjoy remixes? I bought Helbilly Deluxe a while back, and I wasn't all that impressed with it. It's grown on me, but this little baby is what really got me into the Zombie craze. Some of the best remixing artists (unfortunately not NIN, but I'll live with it) have collaborated to give new life (or un-death) to Rob's solo debut works. Sure, some remixes are disappointing, like the two mixes of Meet the Creeper (that song was already flawless in the original), but most of them stand up to and sometimes even surpass the originals. I couldn't stand Rob's original version of How to Make a Monster, but this remix is excellent. And the opening Dragula remix is simply haunting. Sure, what really counts in Rob Zombie's work is his original songs (check out the Sinister Urge; that's the real follow-up to HBD), but remixes add a whole new level to his unique music."
1,American made music to throw up by,"Hellbilly Deluxe is a classic, this is a sad peice of garbage. Everything that makes the songs great on previous recordings is lost in these horrible ""remixes"". I find it hard to believe that Rob Zombie would be part of ruining his own music like this - it not only makes him look like a fool and a sellout, but it also takes away from the reputation that he made for himself with his past work, all for a few bucks. I was very dissapointed to say the least."
5,Everyone Quit your Whining,I happen to like this album and most other Music Rob Zombie does because it's simply incredible music.I am so sick of reading all these whiny Bad reviews about this album and about Rob Zombie QUIT YOUR WHINING YOUR NOT TRUE ZOMBIE FANS YOUR BABIES!TRUE ZOMBIE FANS WILL LIKE THIS CD OF REMIXES.
5,The Deal,"A Remix Album, a very good remix, but ofcourse the old White Zombie stuff is better, than the the newer zobmie, for those of you to young to remember Thunderkiss 65' who keep the hope that Rob will do something heavier than what you've heard in the last 5 years try White Zombie-La Sexorcismo-Devil Music Vol.1, hope this helps you."
2,Don't expect metal,"I love the Hellbilly Deluxe cd, but I don't care for this one. I prefer more hard rock/metal, not with a twist. This cd probally appeals to someone who is just getting introduced to a harder rock or who likes the techno stuff. Me personally, keep the techno to dance music at the clubs. I enjoy all types of music but I like to keep it to one type while listening to a single cd. I might of ruined it since I had owned Hellbilly Deluxe before this one and it doesn't compare to my taste."
1,remix this....,I don't like to listen to remixes unless I really like it and that doesn't happen too often. I gave this cd a chance but it didn't click with me at all. None of the tracks stick out and they are just very bland which is why I got rid of this cd. Even if I was more into remixes I still think that I wouldn't have liked this cd but some people seem to like it. So if you must listen to this cd borrow it from a friend or something then decide if you want your own copy.
3,More strippers and 50's art please.,"aside from a few gem's you can download better music for free. I first got introduced to white zombie through the first remix album, and I had high hopes for this one, however most of the remixes are either generic techno or the same song just paced to a beat. Although it's a nice alternative from the first album, it's not something that you'll be listening to in a year. Also rob's art is tasteless, and even though he probably trys for this, it's not a worthwile achievement. I never deducted a star for this however. This album also isn't nearly as intense as the original. The ""good parts"" of the original songs have been cut and sampled down to a regular song part, and other parts have been improved to be the main chorus of the song. This is much different then the first remix album, where the ""good parts"" of the songs were still the focus of the remix, and I don't like it."
4,A Different Flavor of Zombie,"For you folks who like the slightly techno/sampled edge of Zombies heavy, pounding monster metal, you should give this album a try. True, it does take a litle getting used to, but it puts an entirely new spin on techno-metal that few others can do successfully. I have been a big Zombie fan since day one and was on board the minute I heard of this album. So if you consider yourself a true fan of Rob Zombie's style of ""campy horror flicks meets, aliens from outerspace at the mustang ranch for some good old ""... Rock n'Roll"" Then you must get this CD!!"
3,zombie mix,"Rob zombie is a mixin' guy ,but i think it's similar to White Zombie's Super Sexy Swinging Sounds mix album(1996). Both of the albums' cover show naked chicks. The music is good. You can't kill the deadman, he's back with mixin' energy."
4,This C.D. Burns!,"If you are into remix albums then you will love this!Its just like Hellbilly Deluxe only Faster,Louder, and the artwork kicks some serious butt! definately music thats worth a chance! Check it!"
5,"Good but it ain't Supersexy, or Swingin', but it is Sounds.","Good cd I guess for a remix. The Supersexy Swinging Sounds disc was a lot better. The first Dragula remix is my favorite. The art on the inside takes you back to the old White Zombie days and is sure to scare your parents. The booklet is great with all its live pictures. The only Remix I don't care for is the Girl on a Motorcycle Remix of Superbeats, it just doesn't have the power the original did. Rob: PLEASE come out with another REAL cd. We all want it."
5,Who defines what constitutes a musical genre ???,"Record companies do, that's who. If it doesn't fit neatly into a prefabricated, pre designated slot, then they don't even want it. Fortunately for us, Zombie does it anyway. He crosses boundaries and pushes limits combining qualities of what would otherwise be two tired and worn out genres of music. In a world of homogenized and sanitized music controlled by tin-eared music company executives, we're lucky to get anything new and original. Kudos to those who push the limits."
4,Pretty damn cool stuff.,"This album is probably on par with supersexy... very good, very listenable, moments of greatness and moments of pathetic febleness, but overall very good. Both superbeast remixes are amazing, the Dragula remix is good but can also be found on the Matrix soundtrack, the demonoid phenomenon remix is also great. The rest of is is largely good stuff- there is only one or two songs I skip if I don't have a lot of time to listen. Well worth the money for a Zombie fan or a lust-crazed sex-kitten: the beats of this thing are simply an aphrodesiac."
4,Remixes are getting old!!!,I rushed to the store the day this album came out. I listened to it all and thought the same I do now. Remixes are a thing of the past. The only really good mixes on this CD are liiving dead girl and how to make a monster. Rob Zombie needs to go back and write some new stuff becasue hellbilly delux is getting old. But still the album gets four stars becasue most of the remixes were ok.
3,I got it today and it opitimizes mediocrity,"I got this today and let me say....it isn't worth buying. There are four good mixes on here and that's it. Dragula, Spookshow Baby, TheBallad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore, and the second Superbeast. Everything else is too techno for my taste. I would have given it two starts but I love the cover art (he he) and the book is great."
3,I have no memory of buying this item,"I have no memory buying this item, nor is it on my CD shelf. Though it is by Rob Zombie, so it is awesome by default."
4,Electronica Zombie,"The gathering of three Industrial Rock powerhouses - Rob Zombie, Rammstein & Charlie Clouser (from NIN fame) - might produce what? More Industrial Rock?No. Actually, british techno/electronica stylings are written all over these tracks. For example:Track #1 (Dragula) is Big Beat meats Rob Zombie; sort of a heavier version of the Prodigy (""Firestarter"" comes to mind). A slightly modified version of this track appeared on the ""Matrix"" soundtrack.Track #3 (How to Make a Monster) is Big Beat again; this time around, it has a more hip-hopish, Chemical Brothers feel to it.Track #7 (The Ballad of Ressurrection Joe) sounds like trip-hop to me ears.Track #8 (What Lurks on Channel X?) has shades of the Prodigy's ""Smack my Bitch Up"", starting when the verse kicks in.Track #11 (Superbeast, mix #2) is an interesting drum n' bass version of this song. Actually, I prefer it than the original version. No wonder that's the version used on the ""Superbeast"" video."
4,A very interesting remix album!,"This album contains remixes of the songs on Hellbilly Deluxe. It came wtih a nice soft case, well decorated with Rob's art, as well as photos from live performances. I liked most of the remixes, although I liked the ""Hot Rod Herman"" remix of ""Dragula"" from the Matrix soundtrack than the one included on this album. Although the original album already had a techno sound to it, ""American Made Music to Strip By"" has its own original sound. This is an album every Zombie fan should have."
3,Pretty Good,The Album Has Hit&Miss Material but Hanging on a String is One Of The Jams From the 80's.Very Essential but The Material on a Whole Doesn't Match Hanging On A String.Still they have a Solid Sound as a Group.
2,Only OK,"Loose Ends is one of those groups that has one GREAT song on every CD, hidden amoungst a bunch of mediocrity. ""Hangin' On a String"" is very strong, but the rest of the CD is on cruise-control."
5,good package deal,"This is a very good price. I already owned a taylor food thermometer and a taylor fridge thermometer but I needed another fridge thermometer and this price made getting the set worthwhile. I immediately found that my oven is also not as hot as its indicator reports. It is consistently 50 degrees cooler than it indicates. However, it seems that the recipe authors are also using too cool ovens because when I cooked according to actually temperture, I burnt cookies. I am also using the second fridge thermometer and the tiny digital timer magnet with clip. The only superfluous item is the food thermometer. If you don't own any of these pieces yet, then this is a good buy."
5,WOW!,"This is the best CD I own. I love it! I play both flute and piano and hail my celtic ancestry. James Galway and Phil Coulter are masters! This recording is absolutely glorious, and deserves praise for its creativity, power, originality, beauty, and everything else about it. Incredible!"
1,Defective when it arrived,"The music on this disk is very enjoyable, true to the talents of Galway and Coulter. However, the disk arrived with scratches on it and a formatting error that made it unplayable on my car's CD player. I managed to salvage it by copying it to a fresh disk via iTunes. But I should not have to do that for something sold as a new product."
3,For Bernstein lovers,"First, I am not a lover of Bernstein's Tschaikovsky overall. Although I have to admit, Bernstein's Columbia recording of the 5th is standard. Otherwise, I prefer Svetlanov (Russian temperment)and Karajan (the perfect 4th and overall orchestral sound).I bought this set for the 4th when I discovered that the 1974 (1975?) recording was used. I really liked this recording (until I heard Karajan's). The disappointing feature is the lack of clarity. I fondly remember (and still have) this performance on Quad vinyl. Quad, when listened to on stereo equipment, was brighter and more finely detailed then the stereo mixdowns. Those details are gone from this CD version. Sad, too, because they added so much to the performance.What this all comes down to is that there is no perfect Tschaikovsky cycle. There are a lot of hits and misses out there. As an introduction, it is an excellent set. As one's taste grow, you're going to start looking for those inidvidual performances."
5,An excellent collection of Tchaikovsky's symphonies,"...and at a bargain price, too. I am not a ""professional music critic."" I saw an excellent performance of the ""Pathetique"" on YouTube (Maestro Chung conducting the Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra), and it really surprised me...the Seoul Philharmonic is getting really good and Maestro Chung is no slouch. So I decided to put on the Bernstein version, and was totally blown away. I would sum it up by saying that Maestro Chung rated a strong B+, but alas Maestro Bernstein rated an A+.I recommend this set. The only drawback is the inconvenient packaging :-)"
5,Situation of the church of the early eleven century,what was the situation of the church in that century
2,Something Dangerous,"Natacha has always leaned toward the ""Acid Jazz"" side of music, but her previous CD's always were true to the Arabic side of the music. This CD however is totally experimental and cutting edge stuff in the Acid Jazz category. It is definetely not her standard music, it is for her Acid Jazz fans. I think the CD title is absolutely true, because for her career this is ""Something Dangerous"", it might cause the loss of some fans. Ayeshteni is my favorite album of hers."
4,"Natacha Atlas ""Something Dangerous"" CD","An interesting mix of trans-globe sounds, without being too techno, ""Something Dangerous"" was refreshing and different, perhaps why she used this title, and perhaps why there were 54 used ones available. Including hip-pop, reggae, French Disco, this blend with other artists including Sinead O'conner, was unexpected with her Arabie vocal and musical style. Not much traditional Arabic about this."
4,Be Lost Without IT,"I could never remember getting the dryer once off!!! More IRONING. I SAID I'd call you back in 20 min...oops.. From the time I hit the floor in the morning I;m pretty much maxed out and needed reminders..not another note on the counter.I looked at several on line and chose this. It hangs around neck..clips on clothes..and has a magnet.. I will not be without one ever. Plan on ordering another soon ""just in case"" no joke. I mentioned two things off the top that I use it for,,Uses are endless.. Because it also counts UP.. I've timed myself on ""jobs""..""phone"" just time guzzlers that leave more time for me. Treat yourself..be good to YOU..get it Deb Hendriks"
3,Good idea but...,"This timer was wonderful, and I thought I had found the perfect product. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find the start/stop button too sensitive, nor was the beeping too quiet. It worked exactly as it should. The problem is, it was knocked on the floor off of the refrigerator, and that was it. I opened it up and tried to repair, but to no avail.The idea was great, I love the magnet on the back, the clip and the option of wearing it on the string. It is clearly too fragile to last in a busy kitchen.I won't buy again."
4,My son uses it in school,"My son is in First Grade and uses it in his classroom as a reminder when he needs to move on to his next ""center"" activity. Like from the reading corner to the computer station. It's very easy for him to use and the teacher sets the time, which he can re-start at the next station. The beep is not so loud that it distracts or even draws a lot of attention from his classmates. It's easy for him to take with him too. I think it would be helpful for children that have trouble with transition."
2,TR3 Digital Timer,"This meets my needs for a timer that I can carry with me, is small and compact,and gives me a choice of carrying options."
1,cdn timer on a rope review,"doesn't work; i would think the battery doesn't need replacing. in short, a piece of junk. i think the seller cdn should replace it w/ one that works. shouldn't have to contact ups to return this one...'cause it is going right in garbage can. yes, i did read instructions.louis masonsee that the seller gets this review"
1,Drivel,"This book does nothing to further the reader's education regarding the Ds/SM/BD lifestyle. Rather, the story portrayed here tells of a woman with no direction or self esteem. To claim she is a dominant is an affront to the very word. She has no personal power of her own. She is just a sad little girl who has no conception of what it means to internalize either Dominance or submission. Don't waste your money on stupidity."
3,"Not an insight to SM itself, but an objective view of some elements of the SM scene","The book is not an in depth view of SM practices, it is rather a biography of Jacqueline's early life, as a: young girl, teenager, wife, divorcee, and then an SM player.For those of us men who are single and with little experience of relationships, it has a benefit of providing at least one woman's honest perspective on a range of life experiences, including her mistakes (and how she has shaped to some of the challenges).It does provide an honest (and humorous) view of how some people in the SM scene behave, both players and professionals."
4,Mistress Jacqueline,"I'm not into the scene, but I met Mistress Jacqueline through our mutual friend Xaviera Hollander, the original Happy Hooker, and found Jacqueline to be one of the nicest people outside of her business! As an English director once told me, in England ""it's not what you do, it's who you are"". Her book is interesting in the fact that it's a biography, and (of course) all of our lives are fascinating on the talk show circuit."
5,Very good,This is a wonderful product. I use it even more than I anticipated. Don't know how I got along without it.
1,Horrible,"This thing worked for ten minutes and then it decided that my room temperature was 217F. I removed the battery, the probe, turned it back on and it was still on 217. When I took a temperature of some water I was heating (probably about 150F) it read 256F. Also, I did not see where you turn it off and it doesn't turn off by itself. I guess you have to take the battery out every time when you're done. It doesn't deserve any stars."
1,Worked great for about an hour,"Bought this thermometer to use when home-brewing beer. Used it one time according to the instructions, and after one hour of use, it lost its little mind and started registering over 300 degrees when measuring something I knew to be at 170 degrees. I double-checked with another thermometer, and it was actually 168 degrees. This thermometer now sits in its magnet case on my fridge, reading 240 degrees in my 72 degree house.I guess it's my reminder to always have a backup plan.I have sent a contact email to the company but have not yet received a reply. Hopefully, they will make good on their 5 year warranty. If not, I would definitely invest in a different thermometer next time."
1,Don't buy this piece of Junk,This was an Out of the Box failure. I never knew room tempature was 250 degrees.
5,Core Collection for Nursing libraries.,"Selected by Brandon & Hill (Nursing Outlook, March-April, 1996) as one of best books for small nursing and medical libraries."
5,SS Victorian Red Garnet Bracelet,Absolutely gorgeous. Garnets are quite large and very clear. Silver work is very well done. Fits very well and is made well.
4,beautiful song beautiful extened version,the extended version of MIRACLES is around 5:46. really beautiful song and mix. that's all for the single. forget about the jelly mix.looking forward for the US version to be released in the future (if any).
4,She has a forever young voice,"I love the CD, but was hoping for more of the Peasant's Cantata. Here she is singing only one recitative and one aria."
1,Horrible!,"This book was really bad! I don't like Allie. She's nothing but a brat who thinks she knows everything about horses. And I don't think she deserves Wonder's Legacy. And I'm sick of Jazz! I thought that that would be the end of him in #69 Melanie's Double Jinx. Hopefully, after this book, this time he'll be out of the picture. Another thing, in #62 Unbrdled Fury, they described Hi Jinx as a tall, gorgeous chestnut colt but in this book they're describing him as a short, little ugly colt. Really, the authors need to stick with what had been written before, not always change things!"
5,but it you will want it,if you buy the saw you will see when you get it that you need this fence for the otherside it keeps the wood square and allows you to clamp the right side as well a must.
2,nice on picture,"I work professionally every day with my tools. Those drill bits are not the best quality, but for the price what you can expect.They will do the job. Rather will recommend for home use or raw construction use where detail is not required. I passed those on my worker, he is not able to see the different.....it is drilling smoothly for him."
1,Piece of CRAPPPPPPPPP,"Item came with a tape damaged 5' in. tape is paper thin, You definitely get what you pay for. Stanley 25' contractor grade will last forever. There levels are awesome no better way to go. Thought I would give this tape a try. There I go thinking. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. Unless you have extra money and do not care about the quality of a product. 4' out and the tape will bend off. Jason Gust Barneveld WI"
3,"Great Music, Great Price, But, um...","For those unfamiliar with too much classical music, this is an excellent buy - good pieces, good performances, with especially good vocal performances. But whoever named this album is hopefully out of a job. Early Music is held by most to be pre-Renaissance (or perhaps Renaissance) music. So why the inclusion of Bach? CPE Bach? And BARBER?! Take a pen, strike through the word ""EARLY"" and enjoy the CD."
1,"No more waves, please!","I totally agree with the other review on this one. While I LOVE Angel Beach 2 and 3, this must be the biggest crap coming from accros the pond. 80% Of the songs is not from 2005, plus several songs already appear on their other compilations, rehashed, repackaged. It should have stayed in the hands of ORB Records, not Ministry (if they're really responsible for this crap, I'm so surprised)."
1,its a highschool version of MTVs real world.,"its like a collection of radom youtube clips of highschool seniors on one dvd. sounds exciting right? NOT!its a highschool version of MTVs real world.i looked at the reviews and they mentioned ""The Breakfast Club"" for the iphone generation. SO SO SO SO SO SO SO WRONG. The only similarity in the two are they both take place in a high school. maybe my expectations were to high but this ""movie"" was more like if the people who made the ""Blair Witch Project"" had kids and those kids decided to film their senior year. low quality and lacks any kind of direction what so ever."
3,High Tea Club,"While an interesting glimpse into teen lives, those focused on in this documentary hardly typify the ""American"" teen experience. In the shiny absence of people of color, the kids featured were, for the most part, quite well off and most certainly privileged. Even the issues at the core were trite--getting into college, catching the guy/girl, losing the guy/girl, recreational chemical use, the in club/the geek group... Most of the themes were non-issues, in that at no point was there a question that the kids *would* go to college. The tension was around *where* each would go. They all bounced from love interest to love interest relatively well, save Hannah, and while the majority of chemical use took place in a posh home, parents didn't seem to care. If the idea was to document the concerns and lifestyle of American Teens from the 70s, this was right-on. Not so much for the modern, more worldly wise teen."
2,"The Breakfast Club Teaches that they're not the jock, brain, princess, etc.","I found this movie very disappointing compared to the advertisements. It was billed as a documentary version of the Breakfast Club with a princess, geek, rebel, jock, and heartthrob. But the film totally missed the Breakfast Club's final voice over, which points out very didactically that these stereotypes do not exist as people. The film seems to me to shoehorn these kids into roles that I didn't feel necessarily fit them. I would much rather have seen these kids for who they were rather than through the lens of clichés."
3,Great premise that's not fully explored nor a true slice of American High School,"This is a true documentary version of ""The Breakfast Club"" in that there were no minorities in ""The Breakfast Club"" -- no latinos, no blacks, and no gay/lesbian characters (and no real poverty issues). The American high school system in most of the country is full of all of these characters, and this ""American Teen"" movie is perhaps more like a private high school would be or high schools in very affluent suburbs. For that audience, it's likely an accurate documentary. It can be engrossing, at times -- but it doesn't grab traction due to the superficiality of the characters that the editors and directors chose to include."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"Best song Breathe Easy great vocals and No Goodbyes, sounds good already. They are ballads but this album succeeded because of these two. The rest of the cd is mostly r&b and up-beat. Overall great album."
1,Dosen't Work,The timer goes off 2 1/2 minutes early! I returned it. Too bad - it was just what I was looking for. It deserved a NO star rating.
1,Half Right,"It has a loud bell as claimed,but stopped ticking after short useage. The quality of the new mechanical timers has gone down. Opt for an electronic push button timer instead."
1,my legs have never bled so much,"I bought these blades because the parent company doesn't test on animals. However, each time I have shaved, my legs have gotten torn up to the point where they look and feel like tree bark. I am ssuper careful shaving, but no matter how careful I am, I end up with multiple cuts on each leg. It's so painful! I'm switching back to another brand. DON'T BUY."
5,The Funk comes ALIVE!,P-Funk Rocks The stage on this Set.Flash Light&Knee Deep are rocking on this Funk Set.This is one of the baddest Live albums ever released.
4,all that and a bag of funk!!!,"if u dont have this one then u are not a funkateer, this captures the essence of p-funk. this set includes the best live version to date of cosmic slop & maggot brain and they are kicking it on atomic dog. this is a must have for anyone into the 'P'"
4,It's a good source for advanced students of French,"Those who would like to purchase this audio pack should be prepared for some bumpy ride at first. Many interviews of native speakers are quite hard to understand because of their different regional accents, phonetic difficulties (speakers are ordinary French people with no or very little training in pronunciation). The speed of talking is very very fast and the speakers make no attempt to pronouce everything clear for you to follow. This is not the radio-broadcasting style. Yes, it's great to some extent because it's authentic, but it's not very helpful for intermediate students, with no real exposure to everyday spoken French, trying to learn the correct pronunciation of the language. Nevertheless, the audio quality is excellent, program structure is good, and the price is reasonable"
3,No cover available and food poisoning?????,"I noticed that the newer boxes come with covers- I can't seem to find a cover for this in the stores or on-line. Also, had I known that you could get food poisoning from this item I would have purchased a different item. I had the whole marshmallow roasting in mind when I bought it and now it will just be a temptation to the kids without any benefit. It is attractive though and was extremely easy to put together."
5,So far...great,"I just bought this today and while I've had the fire bowl under 24 hours, I'm very pleased. Very easy to assemble(although for the price I expected something a bit heavier). The reason I feel qualified to write this review is two-fold. One, my fiance is what some people might call a pyro-that is to say he likes to build VERY large fires (but, I guess most guys do). Two, we spent the better part of the afternoon, burning MASSIVE amounts of branches and general yard rubbish. Needless to say, the copper look is long gone, but the patina that remains is attractive. The only thing I wish were different is the length of the handle on the screen tool that is included. However, that is easily remedied by a fire poker of some sort. That's about all...wishing everyone a cozy and relaxing spring/summer outdoors."
4,copper fire pit,"The screen is a bit flimsy, cover doesn't seem to be 100% waterproof, and I wish it was slightly higher off the ground. Other than that this is a great product."
1,Bleh,"This is, hands down, the most boring work-out video I have ever owned. It moved so slow with so many pauses that I felt I would have gotten more exercise doing laundry or watching paint dry. Unless you've never worked out before, this workout video will be useless."
3,Just OK,This workout was just average. I've gone through a lot of workout videos and this is not one of my favorites. The workout itself is not bad but the instructor just seems unhappy and the scenery is so boring. I own 2 other prenatal workout videos and I always go to them first just because this one is a real snooze.
2,Could have been SO much better,"The things that make this workout INTOLERABLE for me are1)The white background. It is very distracting for whatever reason. It is just boring and blank.2)The sound quality is TERRIBLE.3)Teddi Bryant just stands there giving instruction and never participates in the workout. This is a pet peeve of mine.4)She makes quite a few references to labor. I do not want to think about labor, I just want a workout that is safe. I know I am pregnant and do not need hokey tips about doing squats and later using that to propel myself through labor. Also her low tone is too soothing; I need more pep than this offers.The workout itself would be OK if it weren't mind-numbingly dull. I bought this based on the positive reviews and am very disappointed. I consider myself having been an advanced exerciser prior to pregnancy. This workout, along with most of the other prenatal workouts I have tried, was a DUD."
5,Butt Kicker!,I do this everyday on my lunch hour. I even schedule my patients around this workout so I can get the abdominal section in. I like that I am not jumping around and enjoy the leg workout. I have no back pain thanks to the abdominal strengthening and lower back work. It's long but worth it.
5,The P90X of Prego Workouts,"This is a great workout. Perfect for me since I was used to doing more extreme exercise prior to pregnancy. This is not an easy workout, but not too hard either, and you have options to make it fit your exercise level. I have no doubt this will help me with my labor and delivery as well as keeping strong and fit throughout my pregnancy."
3,The Spirit of Racing?,"This is a beautiful and carefully prepared book. That said, I was disappointed by the preoccupation with racing. The title and subtitle don't adequately warn you that the author knows the name of every race car driver ever associated with Alfa. Individual races are given longer descriptions than entire models of passenger cars. If you want to learn the racing history of Alfa, this is the book for you."
5,BEST BOOKS ON ALFA,I think this is the best book for not only the enthsiast but for beginers. This book has important picture and photos for understanding ALFA. Moreover writing memos on ALFA. I choose this book in many ALFA books I have. Enjoy reading!
2,no second countdown,"I like the large display and think the volume of the timer is just fine. However, if you set the timer for 10 minutes it just counts down in minutes, not minutes and seconds, and I dislike this because it leaves me unsure if the timer even started counting down! Another annoying thing is that the timer beeps every five minutes while it is counting down. I only want it to beep when the time is up."
1,terrible,was advertised as having a loud alarm=you can hear it if you hold it up to either ear very closely=this product is a high priced rip-off=a two dollar timer works much better!
4,Gloria by Shadows of Knight,"The title track has always knocked my socks off, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good the rest of the songs were. Good CD!!!"
1,late and damaged,"Don't do it! Just as I'd given up on ever receiving this order, it came after a month, and the box was torn up and even though it was cardboard, some were bent."
4,"Nice product, Good price","This product was great for my purposes - I wanted inexpensive, customizable storage for my magazines. These were the least expensive cardboard magazine files I could find (even with shipping included). I could easily cut the tops to fit into shelf spaces of varying heights. Being made of cardboard, they are not the sturdiest. When full, I support the bottom when handling them. I've reinforced the seams with mailing tape, which has helped. Easy to put together, and arrived in a reasonable amount of time."
1,must be used with Secret Camouflage and Secret Concealer,Only order this cream if you use the above. I ordered a month ago and noticed it was not making any difference what so ever which is shocking for Laura Mercier products. I use a lot and they are fantastic. So I went to the Laura Mercier website to see if I was maybe applying it wrong to find out that her website states that this eye cream was formulated specifically to be used with the Camouflage and Secret Concealer. I have contacted the seller for a refund because they have left out very crucial information for the buyer and I have requested a refund due to poor advertising. I do not use the Laura Mercier Secret system so this eye cream is a waste of money.
4,This CD features the gales with their greastest lead singer,"This golden gospel classic is worth its weight in gold. Back when the sensational nightingales were known as the four knights, they had the hottest lead singer in the country...bar none. This was the hard driving Rev. Julius Cheeks. He never got his just dues, o but listen to these classic that someone ,thank God saved. Listen and be enriched. Throw your head back and listen and then listen some more. This CD is in my top 10. It is a must have, no excuse..get this CD and be blessed."
5,Painful Truth,"The best test of a novel is does it stay with you or does it disappear like so much morning mist. It has been several years since I read this book, but I find myself thinking of it often. My wife and I have discussed the ending a number of times often in sharp disagreement. However, as we have grown older and gained more life experience, the story has become truer, if not less painful, and a favorite of both of ours. It is Mary Gordon's best work which is high praise."
2,Did Not Enjoy the Book at All,"Sometimes when I can't get into a book at first, I hang in there thinking that I'll get hooked in soon. Usually that happens, but unfortunately, it did not in this case. The book centers on an Irish family in the early - mid 1900's, three generations, their motivations, the love they did/didn't receive from their parents, their sagas. Yet, I could not connect with any of the characters, and could barely recall who was who and what had happened from one reading to the next. I loved Mary Gordon's book, Spending. When I read a book and enjoy it, I will read and study other books by the same author. I was very disappointed in this book."
5,Wonderful Value,"This was a present and always like getting a good value. Great fragrance, perfect shipping, and reliable seller. when I need another one, I will be back."
4,"Soft, deep pocketed sheets","These sheets are a poly/cotton blend, but with a high thread count and are very soft. The pockets are super deep (the packaging says they fit a mattress up to 18"" deep). They fit on top of my mattress and memory foam topper with room to spare. I'm pleased with them even though they are not 100% cotton."
2,"Much too small, Not as described","The largest of these finger sleeves was too small to go on my littlest finger without cutting off all circulation. I have large but not huge men's hands. A FAR SUPERIOR product on this (Amazon) website is ""Flents Finger Sleeves"" from AmericaRx."
5,Great easy listening music,"This is a wonderful album for those who love easy listening music. Kudos to the artist and songwriter Scott January of 40 Miles Out for creating such a delightful album. It will take you back to the music of the ""good ol days""."
2,Stalls out,"I am now on my second Breville mixer since March (six months). I use the thing twice a day to blend one half cup cottage cheese with three tablespoons of fish oil & a little milk. After a month or two, the mixer will stall out. At first I thought I was relaxing the pressure on the buttons but don't think that's it. I'll be returning this second one to Williams Sonoma for store credit. I'm here on amazon to find a different brand. The Breville does clean up very easily -- perhaps with less intensive use it would be a fine machine -- not for me."
1,Very poorly built,"This blender was very poorly built. The plastic mixing jug cracked within a few weeks. The stainless steel blender attachment (which is held together with plastic, not steel), broke within the a few months. I strongly advise anyone thinking of purchasing this -- or anything else made by Breville -- to avoid this brand. I had a Cuisinart hand blender that lasted more than 8 years."
1,Never worked right,This blender never worked right and I should have sent it back before the warranty was up. It had trouble charging and would stall when I used it. I thought it was operator error (the buttons are awkward) but I've finally decided it's the machine not me. I will be looking for a different brand to replace this product.
1,Breville BCS600XL,"I received this corded blender as a wedding gift 3 years ago, and have been less than happy with it. Initially the blender worked fine, but now I find that it stalls out all the time, resetting the switch does little to help. I believe this unit is identical to the 500xl as my internet search turned up nothing for the 600xl. I was thinking of replacing the rechargeable batteries but after reading the reviews, I think I'll pass, i'm tossing this one."
1,STALLS OUT! AND I WORK AT WILLIAMS SONOMA,"I have had multiple units and they all stall out. This device sucks, and I own lots of other Breville items."
1,"Great idea, poor execution",The device is too heavy and the switch is unusable. Anybody with small hands will not be able to use it for more than a few seconds.Stay away from this.
4,Breville Immersion Blender,"Overall I'm happy with this product.The look, feel and performance are perfect for me. Things to bear in mind if your looking to purchase- it is on the heavyside and the safety button requires a little bit of practice to get used to (you need to depress two buttons at the same time for it to run).The performance, look and quality of the product ensure value for money but if dexterity and strong wrists are not your forte this may not be the blender for you."
4,I really don't get what people are complaining about,I use this blender almost every day! I never looses power. It never just shuts off.... I have purchased extra ones. I have had a problem with the Chopper accessories coming loose. But overall...to buy this at the current discontinued price is a steal! I think people ultimately didn't understand the safety button mechanism..... if not held right the motor stops. you have to press and continuously hold two buttons to start the motor.
1,"Stalls frequently, on buttons are hard to push","Don't waste your money on this brand. I bought it for the cordless convenience and attractive base but it just can't blend anything thicker or chunkier than milk. I have tried making squash soups, bean soups, smoothies and whipped cream. On everything except the cream, the blender stalls out after less than 1 second of spin time. It lasts 4-5 seconds on the cream until the cream gets thick, then it begins to stall on that too. Turning it back on requires pressing the power button with 1 finger while simultaneously pressing one of the speed buttons with another finger. I find that my hand is far more fatigued after wrestling with the device throughout a pint of whipping cream than it is just using an old-fashioned wire whisk. And forget about the soups, you will just end up using a mouli or a food processor after having exhausted your hand. This model is jay-yoo-en-kay."
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing is useless. Even fully charged, it doesn't ""blend??"" more than a couple of seconds. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone--and really don't feel that it deserves one star."
5,Whizzing away,"After struggling with a food processor and blender trying to puree a bean soup I decided it was time to step it up and get an immersion blender. My boyfriend is IN LOVE with his cordless hand tools so thought it must be the way to go..it is. This blender is easy to use, easy to assemble and clean. It has plenty of power and makes quick work of pureeing and blending. I highly reccommend this produuct."
1,Absolutely Horrendously Cruddy Piece of Equipment,"We got this for a wedding gift. It is so atrociously subpar and cruddy, I wouldn't give it to my worst enemy as a gift. It repeatedly stalls out, with a full charge, on high power, even when blending something pretty soft, like tomato soup. If I try it in a bowl of water as a test, it runs fine, but put it in a pretty soft soup and you have to repeatedly restart it, which given the button configuration, is difficult. It won't run for even 10 seconds in almost anything I try to puree. It is practically worthless and I will be replacing it the minute I get a chance."
1,I regret spending good money on this,"I purchased mine a little over a year ago; money spent that could have bought me something useful. Not nearly powerful enough, very heavy, and the safety switch/speed selection is very clumsy to use. The batteries have already worn out, and rather than waste money sending this beast off to the factory for repair, I'm chucking it and writing it off to lesson learned. (I gave away my perfectly good, reliable and useful corded blender for this junk). I seem to only be able to give this one star - I'd like to give it none."
1,Don't waste your money or time,I bought this from williams and sanoma and it is buy far the biggest peice of jung there is. My wife and I tired to wisk salad dressing and the unit bogged down and quit. We though it was just to thick but after numerous attempts we just gave up. For a kitchen utensil that cost 100.00 you would think it could at least mix salad dressing. Don't buy this it will be a waste of your money.
1,Battery issues,Battery started dying within a year and after 3 years needs a new one. This has to be done by a service centre and the battery was $64 plus labor. I am contacting Breville Australia again in the hope I can get a new battery like the engineer (great help!). Product would have been good withLithium ion and spare battery like a cordless drill.. Which I've found takes my beater attachment and works to do most tasks!! Try it lol#stoplandfill
4,Best cordless blender I've used,"Cordless blenders are rare, and finding a good one is tough. This one is fine for my purposes and comes with a couple useful attachments. I use it to stir protein drinks, make whip cream, me chocolate recipe and other ""light duty"" tasks. It does great and to get the convenience of a cordless, I give up some torque and durability. I haven't found one with both, so this is the closest thing."
2,Breville cordless doesn't stay charged,"The first few months I could use the cordless Breville for a complete job... now it doesn't stay charged at all. It will make one or two slow rotations, and then just go dead. I recharge and when the light it green, it still only goes one or two slow rotations. A lot of money for only a few months of use."
1,Stalls out after one second,Horrible product. It won't blend for more than one second before dying. Then you have to let go of the buttons and re-press to start again...for one more second of blending. This appears to be a common problem with this machine. Do not buy a Breville cordless immersion blender. Waste of money.
3,not enough power,"I purchased this item from William Sonoma a few weeks ago and attempted to use it for smoothies. I use ice from my freezer that has already been ""chopped"" up by the fridge so the ice is not even in full pieces. Every time I tried to put the blender into the chopped ice it stopped completely. I tried repeatedly with no luck. I called William Sonoma and they requested I return it and said that they have had many similar complaints with this item.I do not recommend it for anything that requires a lot of power. I worked beautifully for sweet potatoe soup but you can spend a whole lot less for a blender to puree soup."
2,"Great for years, until.....","I bought mine when Wms. Sonoma was selling them. I loved that it had its own stand for keeping it charged on the counter. Mine worked so well I called it the Terminator of hand held blenders. Until last month when I started pureeing 6 oz. (weighed out) of frozen strawberries with 8 oz. of milk. I was only putting 3 or 4 frozen strawberries in at a time. It worked for a few weeks on a daily basis and then suddenly the little blades moved down further until they stuck out past the plastic ""legs"" and it started to chip the bottom of the plastic blender container. Before this happened I would have given it 5 stars, but not now.I haven't called Breville yet about this but it is very frustrating because my KitchenAid regular blender couldn't puree all the strawberries as well !I see the Cuisinart hand blender has gotten very good reviews so maybe I'll try that one."
3,No replacement blades?,"I think my problem with stalling out is that after six months of making smoothies (including ice-crushing) with the blade, I'm guessing the blade is a bit worn out. so the safety stop when the blade is ""caught"" and won't turn -- meant to protect the motor -- is now activating every two seconds, even when the blade is cutting a frozen blueberry. that would be all well and good IF I could buy a replacement blade, but I can't find one on the Breville site. Not very eco-friendly, or economical! Am I missing something?"
2,Stalls out constantly,"Hi,I purchased this blender primarily to make smoothies. I have owned two other hand blenders in my life and bought this for its cordless capability. As other reviews state, it lacks power and stalls out constantly. To blend a smoothly with a handful of frozen fruits it stalls out maybe 10-20 times in the process. I called customer service to complain and they said it was probably defective. I sent it back and received a replacement only to find the new one has the exact same problem.If you are using to make milkshakes and to blend only liquids, this will probably be fine. If not, save your money and buy a different hand blender."
2,Breville Cordless Hand blender,"I don't recommend this brand of hand blender. As you can see in the picture the stem is made up of two parts, stainless steel and plastic, that are glued together. On my appliance those pieces came unglued. Even though I have tried to glue them back together it is not a permanent fix. And no, I do not wash them in the dishwasher."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this blender","We did a lot of research before we bought this blender about a year ago. We have used it @a dozen times in a year. Picked it up to use it last week and the batteries are dead. It's junk, and expensive junk at that. It's been over a year so we are just out of luck. I'll never buy anything else made by Breville after this experience. I only gave it one star because whoever designed the web page apparently didn't consider the possibility that an item might not even deserve one."
1,Never worked well,I have had this for several years. Overall it was hard to use and never worked right. The combination of the buttons you need to press to get it turned on are very cumbersome. Now that battery is defective and I cannot find a way to get a replacement.Don't buy this product. Look for one that has a cord.This one is poorly designed and was very expensive.
1,A piece of junk,"I wish I'd read these reveiws first. Most of my Breville appliances are wonderful, but this is really crap. The motor will stall out for no reason. You have to then release pressure on both buttons, hold the power button down for a second, then hit the other button. I'm buying a Braun corded unit and wish I had never seen this. For a hundred bucks it is a total waste of money."
4,Heavy metal history lesson,"Every time I think about WWII I think Sabaton. These guys pump out a punishing beat with heavy drums and gravely baritone vocals plus they satisfy the history geek inside me by singing about WWII. It's the best combination ever. No other metal band does justice war, artillery strikes, panzers, the a-bomb, killing terrorists, and the lament of the soldier like Sabaton in this album. Give these camo-wearing Swedish dudes a listen and ""prepare for nuclear attack!"""
5,Great Read!,I really enjoyed reading this book. As a young helicopter pilot I have always enjoyed listening to old / experienced pilots talk about their many flying adventures and that is what this book is all about.
3,Get the other Funkadelic albums first,"I love everything these guys put out, but this album just isn't one of their strongest ones. Funky... jams like ""Loose Booty"" and ""Nappy Dugout"" are sorely missing. And the CD tranfer *is* bad. If you're just getting into Funkadelic, I would recommend you start with the other albums first, and get this one when it's time to round out your collection.That being said, ""I Wanna Know if it's Good to You"" is definitely the stand-out."
1,Sloppy Stuff,"This is the worst funkadelic album. I wish that they had released: The Best of the Early Years Volume One, on CD. Even Funkadelic's Greatest Hits would have been welcome. Try Let's Take It to the Stage, or Tales of Kidd Funkadelic."
1,will a REMASTERED version of this PLEASE be released?!?!,"Real good, trippy early P-Funk work despite waves of musical progression to come in the decade ahead. Title track and 'Some More' (my favorite track) are the highlights of this little psychadelic adventure. However, the mastering of this CD is inexcusably horrendous! It makes the first issue of Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' (not that the other versions are much better) sound like the sharpest sounding CD of all time! On the volume knob, you have to play it at 8 so it (accompanied with hiss) can sound like it's at 4! I simply HAD to return this CD and won't re-buy this album on disc 'til they rightfully remaster it. What a treat that will be."
3,"Good Early P-Funk Jams, But Really Poorly Recorded","Like much of the early P-Funk stuff, there is some real solid funky fun here, but the sound quality is borderline appalling. The song quality is comparable to Maggot Brain (similar proportions of great-to-weak), but with even worse sonics. I consider it a keeper, & do listen now & again, but be forewarned."
4,Complet Christmas Atmosphere,This CD has been the soundtarck to 9 Christmases for me and my small family - just perfect. Christmas morning just would be the same without Robbie O'Connell singing 'Drive The Cold Winter Away'. Brilliant.
5,"Another Tenchi Muyo World! Buy it, read it!",One of the best shows of all time is now in manga form. It's a great story with awesome characters that you can't help but like. ( Note: Do not watch or read any of the Tenchi in Tokyo things... )
2,Hardly compares to the anime.,"Being a huge Tenchi fan, of the OAV and TV series, I think I would know a good Tenchi story. This isn't one of them. Compared to the OAV series it is based on, to the television / Tenchi Universe series, and to any other manga I've read, this was just boring. It has hardly any humour (or rather none worth laughing at), and the storyline itself is too unoriginal to bother reading again. I'm dissapointed that the creator didn't do a better job of making a sequel comparable to the original series. ..."
2,guess I'm in the minority here...,"This book starts with what I think is a many page explanation of everything that's happened before the events of the beginning of this volume. Since this is the first volume, as far as I know, I guess that means that this is an explanation of things that happened in the series. I've never seen any of the series, something which I think crippled my enjoyment of this book. The explanation at the beginning seemed like it should have helped, but all it did was confuse me more. I had a hard time keeping track of who all the characters were, what they were, and why they were there. The rest of the book didn't explain that all for me either. I spent a lot of time vaguely interested, but mostly confused. So, if you've never heard of this before or you've never seen the series, then this is probably not the book for you."
1,Hmmm,"Honestly, this was a terrible book. I have no idea what the author was thinking. This book details the author's sick and twisted world which is obviously quite bad. Bisno should seek mental help and maybe even pass grade school english class."
1,"Why, oh why can I not rate it 0 stars?","It's a chilling reminder of the Unabomber's Manifesto. Apparently, it seems that Bisno (or Biz-natch, to a few that know him/of him) has somehow found a publisher that would print sub-par material. The story, which lacks any depth whatsoever, is riddled with multiple disasterous and gross twists and turns."
5,Excellent book!,"Chick Living is the ultimate book for any college graduate about to enter the work force. Kris Melcher not only gives you down-to-earth advice on how to save money and stay on budget, but how to apply it into living a very productive, fun, and frugal lifestyle. I highly recommend it!!!"
5,Perfect Graduation Gift,I picked this up because I'm in my 20s and just moved into a house. Kris has great tips on how to decorate and live frugally-but her tips go beyond that. This book is perfect for a college student looking for big sisterly advice on everything from career to fashion and entertaining people in your home. Some of my favorite parts were the make-at-home spa products! This will save me a bundle!
3,no bubble wrap,"I ordered the product and it came promptly which is very nice, but the dvd case was also crushed into a zillion pieces. The dvd itself was in good shape, played fine, and was exactly what I wanted, so this review isn't a bad one. I just wish that some care had been put forth to keep the product from being crushed during shipping. Just a plastic envelope with no padding."
1,Weak!!!,Horrible movie. This movie shouldn't even be in the same catagory as an epic masterpiece as The Exorcist. Trash.
3,She has gone... Beyond the Dooooor,"LOL. This movie had me rolling from the first scene to the last. The bad acting, the bad dubbing, the dialogue of the little girl where she talks like a total drugged-out hippie. OMG. Priceless!! The trialer is enough to make me LMAO. I can't believe reviewers on here were actually scared. I mean, maybe back in the day but now?!! LOL It is such an obvious rip-off of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" it's a wonder the director wasn't sued. LOL"
2,Memories,"The movie is actually pretty awful. However, when I was a kid the TV commercial use to scare the hell out of me. Exorcist it's not..."
4,Beyond Beyond the Door,"I was totally freaked out as a child when the TV ad came on and I ran away well Beyond the Door every time it came on! When her head started turning all the way around I was really scared! My mother went to see it by herself and I never had a chance to see it until I just recently purchased it to finally see what I missed out on after all of these years. Well, as I had grown up in San Francisco I was very pleased to watch this movie just to see my hometown back in the day. As far as the movie itself is concerned, it is somewhat of an Exorcist knock-off but true horror fans like me might appreciate and enjoy several scenes. It is dated, no question about that, but I am happy I have it."
3,Horror Film,"This plays more like a drama than a horror film, despite scenes of demonic possession. Lamberto Bava directed a sequel to this, Shock. Kind of an Exorcist ripoff."
3,Unwanted Pregnancy...,"An expectant mother (Juliet Mills) is possessed by a demonic spirit, causing her to vomit green algae, cuss like a longshoreman, and spin her head around backwards. Hmmm, sounds vaguely familiar somehow. Anyway, her useless husband and her doctor try to cope w/ the devilish situation w/ limited success. Enter a mysterious man (Richard Johnson from THE HAUNTING and ZOMBIE) who has his own horrible agenda. BEYOND THE DOOR seems to drag on in many places, making an otherwise decent movie almost unendurable. A good 30-40 minutes could have been shaved off without losing any storyline! Still, it is fun to watch Ms. Mills do her interpretation of Linda Blair..."
5,I've spent my whole life looking for this film...,"I've spent my whole life looking for this film...But didn't know what it was called. I did a google image search for ""possesed"" child and a pic of the character of little Ken with the glowing eyes and the possessed dolls. I absolutely love this film for nostalgic reasons. I saw it at the drive in when I was 5 years old and it scared the crap out of me. I've been trying to find it for years. Cool Italian Exorcist/Rosemary's Baby rip-off. Groovy soundtrack and hilarious dubbing. Love it."
4,Italian rip offs !! I love 'em!,"Fun Excorcist clone. I grew up in the 70's, and boy, do I remember this one. Finally, a quality widescreen print!! You know full well if you are one of the people who will get a kick out of this kind of Euro-sleaze. Good times, suckers!"
2,didn't love it,"while it's based on good, solid rip-off material... Beyond the Door doesn't deliver. nothing worthwhile happens for the first 45 minutes or so. while this is a strength in great films like The Exorcist, badly dubbed Italian exploitation flicks like this get douched... hard!more boring than thrilling. the few good possession moments at the end did not justify the initial two thirds of the movie. too bad, could have been awesome in the hands of Fulci, Argento, or the guy who directed Cannibal Holocaust.D"
2,Lame movie,"This movie was lamer than the exorcist, which all of those movies are completely boring and annoying. The only part worth watching is when that weird band follows that guy down the street for like 5 minutes, and a guy in it plays a flute with his nose lol. Oh, also doesnt come in that box^ comes in a standard dvd case, the disk and case are flawless despite the movies content."
3,this is the best!!!,"This moniter is a great idea! you can play your gamecube anywhere!If you go to your relatives house and cant use the t.v, just put on the moniter and you can play your favorite game!"
5,game cube scerne (portable),I think tis new idea will take gaming to the next level of portabable gaming.
1,"If I could put 0 Stars, you know and I know that I would.","I have recently purchased InterAct's 5.4"" Mobile Monitor.I asked for the Intec, and the customer service said they fixed the problem and it's 100% LCD now.So, I bought it and tested it.It looked great, but then I realized there was a terrible blur to it.This is probably caused because of the backlight, which won't let it support 60fps games, such as the ones I have. It also boxes around you gamecube and looks weird... It's also much more expensive than Intec's Mobile Monitor. It may be only 5 inches, but it has 2 headphone jacks, doesn't blur, doesn't break, doesn't have recycled LCD, doesn't have lines on the screen, and doesn't have broken hinges.The problem is, it's hard to get your hands on an Intec screen.If you bought this, look closely and see the blur.. Try Sonic Adventure 2 and jump with Sonic.. You can see him blur around. It also has fuzzy coloring and graphics... I'd buy the smaller but cheaper and higher quality Intec screen."
5,owned this before,"I will be saying this a lot...this is one more program I'm renewing. wore the others out.I have been a fan of theirs since 1970...? joe ligons was pronouncing his last name as ""liggins...""I told him I have (had) the same (maiden) name and we say ""lig-ons."" if you hear him say his name after that year, he now says the same as me...tell him yvonne ligons, jimmy jones' old girl said that ...they were appearing in oakland, ca. at the (then) oakland auditorium...(I'm not-t, the one jimmy left in chicago...smile...)I'm always amazed that they don't use ""what a friend we have in jesus"" as their signature song. their rendition of that song, is what distinguished them from other male gospel singers and put them on top...joe leading with 4 hig-hhh tenor voices backgrounding...and richard on the guitar..I first had this on a LP, then an 8 trac, then cassett and now cd...and wore then all out. hope this last...I will probably buy one more after I renew all my other stuff just to set aside..LOL"
4,A late blow away,"It was not until someone had the brilliant idea to mistakenly leave a copy of this record at my house in 1966, one wet summer evening, that I heard it for the first time, and it blew me away like no jazz had before. Admittedly naive, I had only formed my opinions on jazz around Kid Ory, Duke Ellington, Dave Brubeck, and Glen Miller. I had heard Lewis before and Gillespie, but this was somehow so much more powerful. Almost every level of playing is demonstrated from tender to blast, with such consumate ease it still to this day blows me away. Playing it today is a combination of pleasures from nostalgia, admiration for a great generation of players and musical astonishment."
3,A few classic tracks,"I bought this cd for specific tracks, so i knew what I was getting. If you're familiar with old school house music from chicago in the early 80's, you'll enjoy some of the hot tracks on this cd."
3,good...,Good questions but answers could contain more explanations with small reviews on the respective subjects. Use it as additional help and to test your knowledge...This is common with the rest of Q&A books of the series
1,defective,"No sound, no alarm. Seconds not displayed during last minute of countdown, as advertised. A silent timer is worthless. No better than monitoring time on my watch. At least my watch is easy to carry around."
2,didn't like this one,"It works, but has few options and won't stand up so I can see the time from a distance."
5,Best Timer I've Ever Owned,"This timer is well worth the money. My kids use this timer to time themselves while doing homework, taking turns on games etc. It's very simple to use, and is sturdy and dependable. The ring is loud enough to hear from another room, and the digital display is big and clear. The triple A battery is easy to replace. The magnet on the back is handy for keeping the timer on a file cabinet or refrigerator. The magnet is strong, so that the timer doesn't fall off. I already have 2 of these timers at home, since the kids and I use it so much. It's convenient to have one in the kitchen, one in the playroom, and one in the office, so I'm thinking of buying a 3rd."
4,very good timer,"I use this one in the kitchen, and it works very well. stuck by a magnet on my fridge, this one doesn't budge, even when the door is slammed. the timer ring is very loud and resembles a fire detector alarm, first time i heard it, it gave me a good jolt. even after I've owned it for a month or so, the ring still scares me. the alarm will ring non-stop for about a minute if you don't rush to turn it off. One thing it lacks is seconds countdown, I'd like to know exactly when it will hit 0."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I picked up the TM4 to use for conference lightening talks. It isn't really very loud; only as loud as you would expect for a timer. The button labeled ""HR"" is also labeled ""Clear"". It doesn't clear; you have to go to 20 then try to stop at zero. It beeps with each button push- which makes it a bit irritating to use. The TM4 that I have switches automatically from showing minutes for the last minute to showing a 60 second count down, and it looks exactly like the one pictured here."
2,way way too loud!,"we returned it immediately. it was unpleasantly loud just trying to set the timer, and the alarm was adrenaline inducing. If you're hard of hearing this would be great, but otherwise it's a misery.straight forward and easy to use though."
1,Mislabeled,"I ordered a copy of this item and what I received was NOT the CD pictured, which should feature Michael Schneider playing Vivaldi's Op. 10 flute and recorder concerts. Instead, i got a triple CD from Bachs BWV244 Matthäuspassion. I did not bother returning a $3 used album, but buyers should be aware that amazon mislabeled this item. ""Baroque Esprit"" is the name of a series by DHM, not the CD title. I am still looking for the Vivaldi album..."
4,Big book on small spirits,"This expanded version of a previous publication on Indian dolls from the Heye Foundation collections has beautiful illustrations, and excellent text content. My only wish is that more photographs of the extensive collections at what is now NMAI would have been included, particularly from the Plains areas. I would have opted for a few fewer large format photos in exchange for more smaller ones."
2,"Low power, wire exposed","This is a quick review:Cons:LED light output is very dim. And this problem alone is enough to dissatify me. They use low power LED's plus flexible plastic cover, which greatly blocks light output. Furthermore, the tape-on feature is only good if your mirrors have round corners. For sharp corner mirrors, like my camry 2010, expect disappointment. Also no matter how you install these, the wire will be exposed.Pro:package includes long wires for installation.Not recommended."
5,good but i think a little expensive,"good materials , easy installation, good look.good but i think a little expensive"
4,in-between Barbiere and La Cenerentola,"This is an opera which Rossini wrote 2 months before ""Il barbiere"". It hasn't got the same verve and natural situations, it's more down-to-earth and calmer, more introvert. But the melodies and arias are beautiful and dramatic. The first-act finale is true Rossini, like another scene preceding it, beginnning with the trio for 3 male voices-""A qual raggio di speranza"". It's an intricately built trio with a solo passage for horn (I think it's a horn..).There is some borrowed music and it fits in very well.The conducting couldn't be better and the singers are all good, Ernesto Palacio is a specialist known from other Rossini-recordings and he's always stylish. Dorliska (Pediconi) has a bit edgy voice but I like personal voices so for me it's a plus, and Antonucci is very good as il Duca.The text is expertly written and specifies some of the self borrowings as well as describing the work and it's origins, a libretto is also included."
4,THE CLOSER WITH BRAINS,Realistic portrayal of successful women in a former male domain. Story lines can be far fetched at times. Hard to believe some of the personal life situations .
5,Full of fantastic activities that help make Shakespeare fun!,"The Shakespeare Set Free Series offers wonderful activities to get students to see that Shakespeare is fun! The lessons are creative and encourage cooperative learning. The lessons I've used are the ones students have reacted most positively towards. Exclamations of ""that was cool"" are the proof!"
5,Fun AND Challenging,This is the perfect resource for Shakespeare. I have used it with fluent and limited English speaking high school students with great success. It features challenging curriculum that can be fun for the students. I've tried so many Shakespeare resources that have missed the mark--either too ambiguous or too elementary and superficial. I highly recommend this versitile resource.
3,A bit misleading,This would be a great resource for a drama teacher who is tyring to incorporate a bit of language arts into their classes. I did not find most of the exercises beneficial for teaching Macbeth tohigh school seniors in English class.
4,Basik is like an unnofficial legend.,"If you love living legends in their prime, mid to late 90's, this album is for you. It features some very nice production from various sources and a track with grouch. Basik has a very unique flow in which he doesn't value rhyming as much as getting a point across in a stylish way. His voice is anything but monotone, which keeps things interesting, but definitely no singing. This album is pretty street oriented, not thugged out, but street oriented. Basik paints pictures of the beautiful Los Angeles landscape and its inhabitants from his perspective."
3,"Good, but ultimately a little disappointing","I bought this book based on previous customer reviews and was partially disappointed. It is well-written and has a good summary of evidence from paleoanthropology and recent and current theories about human evolution. The author's emphasis on chance, coincidence, and choas in evolution is a good antidote for past speculations about environmental or other ""causes"" of human evolution; but ultimately I didn't find major new insights about the relation between chance and natural selection. And I was disappointed with the final chapter that speculates about future human evolution but focuses entirely on potential genetic changes. I am more interested in cultural evolution which is likely to be the dominate influence in our future."
3,"Good, but for outside use only...","This was much smaller than I had expected it to be but it's perfect for traveling or going to the beach. Sound is good, but make sure you are outside with clear skies for the antenna. It wouldn't even catch a signal next to the window. Overall, good considering it's the only one I coudl find that is compatable to the Starmate 1."
3,Sometimes frustrating,"The product is okay when you are outside, but if you are inside, forget it. Be prepared for it not to get a signal and go in and out on you. I'd rather use the regular stereo than fuss with this when Im inside."
3,Not a bad unit but lacking features...,Unfortunately there is no way to customize the EQ on this unit that I see (no treble/bass) and there is no place to store the AC adapter on the unit so if you take it to somewhere that will have outlet power you will need to bring the ac adapter seperately... a minor inconvenience. Otherwise the unit is pretty nice. I haven't used it on battery power yet so I am not sure how long it will last.
4,Sirius Boombox great for outdoor use,Great sound and portability. May need to move around satellite for optimal reception.
2,Not worth it.,"I had to return them. The diamonds were too included. They looked like they were peppered. I ended up spending more money on a different pair, but it was worth it in the end."
2,Meh.... Look elsewhere.,"Received I3 K colored earrings. They are so included that you can tell from 4 feet away. The inclusions make them look fractured in the middle. Very low on sparkle... So, great price, but perhaps look elsewhere."
4,Useful reference book,This is a valuable book to have around the house if you are trying to avoid excitotoxins in your food.The recipes which compose almost half of the book are useless to me as too many include gluten but the first half of the book was worth the price.
2,Mediocre,"This book is full of knowledge, but its not very organized. Its kind of hard to follow. There are some great recipes and information, but I would not recommend it."
5,Read this book first,I bought my first copy in 1999 when I suffered from disabling migraines. As I began to learn about food and what to avoid I began to gain control over my migraines. I still buy this book to give to others who seem most appreciative. I also can not understand why anyone would discount this book. It gives a clear and concise overview of the problem many people have with food sensitivity but don't comprehend. If people want to go on further and experiment with vitamins and supplements that is fine. I personally am willing to make some dietary changes to have a better quality of life.
4,A lot of info in a quick-read format,"I found this book has given me a much better prospective on how much MSG is hidden in our foods. MSG lurks in our food under many other names. This book gives you that information in a simple, quick-read format. Easy to go back to when in doubt. I am also gluten sensitive, so a food with MSG can present as a gluten reaction. This book helps me to identify the culprit."
1,Worst Book List,"If there was a money back guarantee, I would return this book. It follows a trend of the nineties into the first decade of 2000. Read my book, all life's problems solved, pretty pink package. It also follows the trend, ""I be guru, you be guru, and we endorse each others books."" To mention deep greiving and state that this can be done in 7 days is not only erroneous, but unhealthy, is only one example. I have spent 16 years working at deep levels with women, and my own experience dictates, time, plus effective process, plus, proven principles has the best results."
5,Be prepared for breakthrough,"I bought this book two days before I took the Journey seminar in Los Angeles on May 17 & 18, 2003. I loved the book; it was an easy read about a deep subject - getting in touch with who you really are - could sound like new age woo-woo to some but let me tell you this is the most cutting edge healing and freeing process available that I have found. I've taken tons of seminars and have been a healer myself for many years but this is a gift of astronomic proportions. If you are ready for it, the freedom you have been seeking is here. In my opinion - and it's only my opinion based on my actual experience - it is the most important work being done for individuals in pain on the planet at this time."
5,You can heal yourself...,"This books shows you the amazing healing potential of the body and the soul. Never before has any book so convinced me that healing was truly possible and now I absolutely know it is. And... the amazing part is, this process is really simple and the script is in the back of the book! You can do the process with a friend. This book has changed my life in more ways than I could possibly describe. Thank you Brandon!"
3,Yes but....used as a commercial product,"I really liked the Book of Brandon Bays, I watched the videos on the net so I joined yesterday the seminar of the Journey: 4 hours of video listening to her the stories I knew by heart: impossible for me, so I went out for 30 minutes but I had critics because the energy of the room was disturbed without me. I came back after 30 minutes and took a magazine. At the lunch time, the organiser told me I had too negative energy for the group with this attitude: I replied I wanted to start the practical healing, the methods of B. Bays..not only watching videos.The man has been so negative with me ,I had to leave the seminar..."
5,An Important and Wonderful New Work,"I have been lucky to know about this book before most Americans, thanks to my British wife. Brandon Bays has developed a profound new ""spiritual technology"" that can transform individuals' lives and truly heal people. She developed this process while healing herself of a football-sized tumor in her abdomen in 6 and weeks. A wonderful new and important work, which I believe will take off here like wildfire."
4,womans black wig,"Decent quality. Perfect fit for me, a medium sized woman. Had a ball with it. For Snow white a shorter wig would be more appropriate, but this was just fine for trick or treating at Disney! I would definetly purchase this again."
4,Must Have for GAmecube owners on the go,"This product has been a lifesaver fro me. I get to take my unit wherever I go and when things get boring I just turn it on and play away. True the screen does take away from the experience but not enouph to diminish the fun you have with it. The color is good, sound is good, and best of all its perfectly portable. I give this product thumbs up."
1,IT SUCKS!,I am very displeased with this product. The reason is because the screen was covered in sctraches and and does not even work when set up.
1,Poor implementation of neat idea,"I was so looking forward to buying one of these. 2 days ago, I saw it and immediately bought it.Too bad I was hit with tremendous disappointment when I hooked it up.1. Super poor video quality. They are either pulling the video off the Composite lines, displaying on an low resolution LCD display, or both. Plus, you can see a couple of hot spots (bright areas) in the display that I imagine is the backlighting. Horrible Moire effects in games. Unusable by anyone who places a value on high video quality.2. The idea of using a car adapter to power both the GameCube and display is cool. Why not power the display from the GameCube's power adapter? You need to hook up their auxiliary AC adapter to power the unit at home.Alas, I boxed it back up and returned it. Sigh.(...)Russ"
1,SORRY,it stinks it sorry and furthermore its so blurry buy the intec i dosent have high resolution it has stn stationary its crappy dont buy if i could of gave it -40 i would of
4,A Must Have For Gamers On the Go,"As soon as I heard about this I knew I had to buy it for my GameCube. I tested the Mobile Monitor with my GameCube games, my friends GameCube games, and GameCube games I rented. All the games were awsome on it! There was no problem keeping up with the fast WaveRace and Star Wars Rogue Leader. Super Smash brothers Melee ran just as great. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 was one of the best games to use for the Mobile Monitor. The only (minor) problems I came across was Pikmin, difficult to see at some points, but all the detail was there, and Batman Vengence, which was to dark or to light depending on how you adjusted it. The car adapter allows you to play on car trips and the A/V input options allow you to hook things up to a vcr, dvd player, etc. Overall it performs above average."
5,great accesory if you can afford it,This monitor is great for long car trips and stuff. it has a car adapter but if you're on a plane you'll need to buy the separate battery (...). This picture is sharp ands its mercifully backlit. its super i love it
1,Buyer beware,I bought this monitor and had to immediately return it. The screen was completely obscured by scratches. I never even got to try it out. The screen arrived so damaged that there was no hope of viewing anything on it.
5,The definitive Funkadelic album,"By 1974, Funkadelic had divested themselves of their psychedelic influences, but had not embraced the pop hooks and radio-friendly dance beats of their later albums. The result may be their definitive masterpiece-they became nothing less than an R&B-oriented hard rock band, unleashing a sound as brutal as anything Led Zeppelin released at the time, but with more grooves. This is guitarist Eddie Hazel's finest hour-he comes on like a locomotive, thundering through the first 2 phenomenal tracks-""Red-Hot Momma"" and ""Alice In My Fantasies""-with unrestrained fury. If those 2 weren't enough, the album contains the hilarious, weird ""Jimmy's Got A Little Bitch In Him"" and ""Sexy Ways"", both displaying a classic R&B sound (albeit a rather twisted one). Not just the best Funkadelic album, but an all-time classic on par with ""Physical Graffiti"" or ""Purple Rain."""
4,She IS the queen,"Etta albums can be uneven affairs, and this one is no exception. But overall this album will be tough to take out of the Discman. Not only does she belt out some classic blues, but she covers a few unlikely songs in the most interesting ways. Check out her cover of Dylan's ""Gotta Serve Somebody"" and the Stones' ""Miss You."" She also does something wonderful with ""Hound Dog."" For those who love the straight-ahead blues, your life will never be complete until you've heard Etta belt out Otis Redding's ""Hawg for Ya."" Not every song on this disc is a gem, but most of them are. So pick it up and get down with Etta, who is truly the matriarch of the blues."
2,"Etta, it's time to retire","It goes without saying that Etta James was one of the greatest R&B vocal artists.Sadly for buyers of this CD, the operative word is ""was.""Some singers mellow with age and present you with new and delightful variations of their unique gifts -- Ella, Sarah, Aretha, to name a few.Etta is in the other category -- you could call it the Billie Holiday category.At 62 years of age, Etta sounds as if she's been chain-smoking Chesterfield plain-ends since the day she cut ""Fool that I am."" Her range is non-existent, her intonation is poor, her delivery is flaccid, and she sounds -- I'm sorry, but there's no other way to put it -- old and tired.The band, however, is great -- but their energy only underscores Etta's fatigue.This album makes me feel the way I do when I see the also once-great Roberto Duran in the ring: depressed."
4,Nice Camera,"Canon Sure Shot 76 Zoom Date 35mm CameraI purchased this product for my daughter who is taking a photography course at her high school. I think this is perfect for anyone that is new to a 35mm camera. It is easy to use and if you read through the manual, it is also easy to find and use some of the special features. I would recommend this product to anyone new, or that likes to occasionaly use a film camera."
4,Héctor Armando Flores,"This shirt was a gift I did it myself, was just the size I ordered, Dallas is my favorite team Caowboysthanks"
2,Touch - a - Don't,"Bottom line - It is a waist of money. I did read the reviews before purchasing this toy. I thought the complaint about not having a back light was an issue for children to play in the dark. I didn't realize in the best lit rooms, it is very difficult to see the images on the screen. I purchased this toy for my two 1/2 year old who is obsessed with Dora and she does not like this toy."
1,Crummy,"Didn't work, crummy product. 'Nuff said?I'd pop for a better one, still. Keeping the fridge temperature correct really makes a positive difference."
1,they're pish,These mitts are poor quality. When I first used the mitts I could still feel the heat from hot oven trays. Then the situation only got worse a few days later as the seam between the the thumb and finger split so now they are useless. I wouldn't recommend these at all!
2,Disfunctional design,"Grab something with one of your hands between your fingers and thumb. Go ahead, do it. Now look at the position of your thumb in relation to your fingers. You'll notice that your thumbs are most useful for grabbing objects when they can provide opposing force against your fingers. Unfortunately, the thumb joints of these mitts are rather stiff and inflexible, not at all conducive to using your thumbs. As a result even the simplest oven maneuver becomes a clumsy affair with these mitts on.You can't really blame Calphalon for this; most oven mitts on the market suffer the same design flaw. Ordinary glove and mitten manufacturers, on the other hand, fixed this problem long ago and now stitch the thumbs so they fold against the palms instead of out to the sides. Is it really so much to expect such basic functionality from an oven mitt?"
3,Excellent Product. Not For Small Hands.,"I received my Twill Thumb Mitt today. It is a well-designed product that protects my hand from the heat. However, it is very large for my small/medium female hands, which makes it difficult to grip. When I grip to open the oven door, I can make a complete fist. My hand simply pulls away from the mitt. I ordered only the left hand mitt, which I will keep because the product is very good. Maybe I will get use to the size and find a way to manipulate my grip. Well, that's my two cents."
4,works very well,It's nice to not have to worry about burning a wrist on a hot pan or oven rack - I like the extra protection that this glove affords.Someone was thinking!
2,Transmits heat,"Item looks nice, but when compared to my inexpensive previous mitts I bought in the grocery store, these Calphalon mitts are much thinner and transmit heat. They make you feel like your hands are burning if you hold an item for more than 2 seconds. I would advise looking elsewhere for a better quality product. The appearance and coverage are the only nice attributes."
1,"""Too Big"" agree","I agree with Josh who wrote the ""Too Big"" review. Good quality but too big and the thumb is too short. You have no dexterity, to the point that they do not feel safe to use while moving hot cookie trays."
2,Not very durrable,These look great and are well sized for smaller hands but they are not durable up to 500 deg F. First time I used them on a 350 F cookie sheet the fabric scorched and turned black. Returned for a refund.
1,Don't Get Burned!,"Having had good luck with Calphalon branded 'hot pads', we ordered this item to use while bar-b-quing.WOW! It provided little if any heat protection, resulting in a near burn. A repeat attempt to useit (by another person who had not witnessed the first incident) produced the same surprising result.This product has to be considered dangerous for handling anything really hot. To use the ConsumerReports terms, we rate it Unacceptable."
2,Not happy!,"I have had these mitts for a while, but have probably used them about 10 times. Both mitts are separating between thumb and the rest of the mitt. The opening is about 1 inch. I have other mitts that I have used for over 10 years and have never had this happen. I would not spend the money for these..."
4,durable,"Got a pair of these and they have been wonderful. I used to be too lazy to purchase proper mits and used towels, plastic oven gloves, cloths to get the trays out of the over. Many burns have been involved! I wish I had gotten these mitts earlier because they provide great grip for piping hot items and even if I hold a tray for 10 whole seconds, I can only feel a little bit of heat going to my fingers. Been using them for half a year and there are no holes or anything yet!"
3,Nice quality but....,While the quality is there they are way under sized. My wife can barely get her hands in them and I can't even come close.
2,Calphon Twill Thumb Mitt,You can not hold anything that is hot for very long. It is not as heat resistent as other gloves/mitts that I have purchased.
3,ONLY ONE MITT,"Ok, so call me blonde but when I ordered this I ASSUMED that it was for a PAIR of mitts. Well, you get one. One mitt for $15. Needless to say I was not able to gift this for Christmas since I needed... TWO GLOVES.As for the glove itself, it is very nice. The red is intense and they shield well from heat. Obviously, don't handle boiling water or oil with them.Anyway, I am quite irritated there was only one mitt and I am debating spending $30 on a pair. That's expensive.Happy shopping!"
4,mitt glves,to clumsy for female smaller hands Otherwise no issues Great for a mans sized hand They should make one for smaller hands to grip better
5,A real Winner,Love it...I first tried the Caphalon red pot holder...I just don't like these all silicone pieces...and this give you the best of both worlds...quality fabric that does not fade or shrink plus the durability and heat resistant caphalon... so I ordered another po holder and a mitt...true red and lovely in my red themed apple kitchen.
1,This item can be dangerous,I have had several occasions where I could not release the item when I put it in or took it out of the oven. In both cases my dinner ended up on the floor. Thank god there wasn't a child near by. I think these should be recalled. The silicone strips are simply too tacky.
1,Worthless,They don't do any better than the cheapest grocery store oven mitt. I can just get a casserole out of the oven and onto the top before my fingers are burned. There is no way I could walk 10 steps to the dining table without the heat going right through and burning me.
1,Good Idea Gone Wrong,"Silicone covering seems like a good idea, but....because of the silicone trying to grasp a hot item was very difficult to maneuver. Glove becomes too tacky & sticks to the hot item & you can't adjust the grip for balance. I finally used a potholder & glad I didn't drop my warmed up plates."
1,DO NOT WORK UP TO 500 DEGREES AS ADVERTISED!!!,I am soOOOO disappointed! This says it will work up to 500 degrees. I made my usual pizza at 425 and nearly burned my hand. these do not work!!!
2,Not that great,"This pot holder is marginally better than the 10 year old one it replaced and had been washed/wet several times, thus necessitating the need to buy a new one that was more heat resistant. IMHO, this Caphelon one isn't worth the premium name or price. For starters, the webbing that is in the area where the thumb portion is attached to the main mitt part does not do a good job at all in sealing out the heat, so its borderline dangerous. The entire mitt has these somewhat slick/sticky lines on it that hinder your ability to cleanly release item to and from the oven. On the plus side, the length of the glove is good. I'll use it, but I definitely wouldn't buy another one, or recommend it to someone else."
5,Great Cooking Mitt,"I am a 64 years old male and homecooking for a long time. This mitt is by far the best I have ever used. If your husband is interested in baking, this would be a great gift. Plenty of room inside the mitt for male hands. The silicone strips adds just enough gripping power to secure items when pulling them out of a hot oven. The mitt go high enough up the arm to prevent burns on the wrist or forearm. When using this mitt, I can hold an extremely hot pot for minutes without feeling the heat on my hands. I haven't used it for the grill but I would think it would be great for that also. I have had this mitt for at least 6 months. I think the price is right for the value."
4,Great Prints,"These prints are beautiful--you can see every stroke of the brush. Large and heavy book, hard for me to get comfortable reading in on the sofa--but at a desk it works fine. The interpretations the author offers are interesting but not neccessary, they might be more usuful for someone who has never tried to analyze art. I give it one star off because the medium used and dimesions of the piece are not listed. Unfortunate. Also, I wondered why artists such as Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt and Lucian Freud were not included. Might have been to riske. In any event, this is a beautiful book for one's personal library."
4,Great period book on the subjecct...,"If you're looking for a version from ""the other side of the hill"", this book is for you. Very readable and recommended."
3,decent bur broke down easily,"I was looking for something to hold my lens cap and thought this would do the trick. It does but with a little pressure, the plastic came off the adhesive rubber. I put in a permanent glue and now it stays there. I could have given it five stars if it held perfectly though."
1,Horrible,"It broke within an hour of using it. Basically it's a cheap foam pad glued on with some equally cheap glue onto the plastic. Even though it's really cheap, don't waste your money buying this.You are better of buying a spare lens cap! I wish I could give this thing -5 stars!"
1,lens cap leash,"The piece came off the adhesive on the lense the first time I put it in the camera case. I have tried to reattach, but doubt that it will hold. Disappointed"
4,capkeeper,This was a gift so I cant comment on how well it works only to say that I see it is a great product and seems to be working fine for the person I gave it to. The delivery was quick and I had no problems with this buying experience
1,Item did not arrive.,This item has still not arrived. The sender claims to have mailed it to me several times. I ordered it a month ago. Very disappointing.
5,OK with Canon SX10IS,"Purchased this because the Canon SX10IS does not include a tether for the lens cap. This tether is unobtrusive, functional, and fits in nicely with the SX10IS by strapping around the base of the fixed lens barrel. Didn't mind paying a couple of dollars for postage for a good product, and at under $5 including postage it's really not an issue."
5,Good Product,I have only had this product for a few days. I like the shorter attachment string as it keeps the lens from hanging too low when in use.This really seems to do the trick.
1,"Short cord, weak adhesive",The adhesive is very weak and separated after a couple of uses. The cord is also too short for my large zoom lenses. My original lens cap fell in to the river after the adhesive wore off.
2,Seemed like a good idea...,"Well, all I can say is that it worked great, and seemed like a good idea so that I would not haveto be putting all my lens caps in my pockets and break them or loose them.It worked great (as it was supposed to) until on the 5th day, my lens cap fell into a river that Iwas standing on and I had to spend almost 10 minutes chasing it down :sIt seems that the glue it's just not that good and it stops working very soon...So, im back to putting my caps in my pockets :D"
2,The non-sticky cap,"the sticky part is no longer sticky after it came of a few times , I don't use it any more"
4,wish I had another one,"I bought this on a whim, attached it on one of my lenses. Presto!! No more digging in my pockets for the lens cap! I have an SLR camera and more than one lens and get irritated when I switch to the other lens and have to go through the stow and hunt routine. Must purchase another!!"
4,Seems ok,"My Wife has a tendency to misplace my lenscaps, Last time it ended up under the seat of her car, go figure. Anyways this looks like it'll work, but I'd add a dab of super glue to help it stay on, otherwise it may not be very useful. Replacement namebrand caps are a bit pricey."
3,Keeper falls off zoom lens,"The lens cap keeper is ""attached"" to the lens via an elastic band. The problem is that when the lens is retracted, there is little room for the band and it easily falls off the lens.However, for the price you cant complain too much."
5,Lens cap keeper,If you buy the Cannon SX10 this is a must have - the lens is not attached to the camera so this lens keeper is just the right solution - works perfectly.
4,Good accessory for loose lens caps,"I purchased this ""Bower HQACAPKPR"" lens leash for my Canon SX10IS. Would be nice if a 'leash' was included with any camera that has a detachable lens cover. It does it's job and was inexpensive. This tether is much cheaper than replacing the lens cap or scratching your camera lens while waiting for a replacement cover. Like others shared, the adhesive failed. An easy remedy with a dash of 'Super Glue'. Not many people carry ""Super Glue"", so I suggest a drop of glue when first attached. Seems when I use a point & shoot, I look for simplicity and wish not to be troubled by concerns for the lens cap. I've had this Bower lens tether for over a year and I haven't had to replace my lens cap. I give it four instead of five stars per the adhesive problem.I also own a DSLR Canon with multiple lens & rather than using this or a similar tether on my multiple caps, I guess my mind adjusts and I place these lens caps in my pocket as I did with my old SLR's lens caps."
4,Useful for the money,"I bought this for my Canon XT with a 18-55mm IS it works fine. I just cleaned the surface of the lens cap then stuck it. Also the elastic ring fits firmly around the lens, but gets in the way of the AF and IS switches."
4,Great price items work perfectly,Replaced the lost cap and has cord so I won't do the same to this one! Yippee...I would recommend this to anyone in need of a cap.
1,Worthless,"I recently lost a lens cap and wanted something to make sure it didn't happen again, so I bought this product. The cord is too short to reach on my longer lens (a 70-300mm Canon), though it fits the stock 18-55mm lens OK. But it doesn't really matter as the adhesive is so weak that it just fell off after a few days of use. This product was horrible. Do not buy it!"
1,Poor Stick,"I find the Bower CK501 a poor product. It needs a stronger adhesive on the button. I also think that the cord should be 2"" longer."
1,Broken in Minutes,"This cap keeper arrived quickly, looked good, and broke almost immediately. The elastic meant to hold the keeper around lens fell apart as soon as I tried to stretch it around my lens."
1,"Waste of money, even if it's only $1.84","Don't waste your money on this poorly-made, cheap, Chinese piece of junk. As soon as I took it out of the package and handled it, the cord ripped. The cord is very flimsy and where it is clamped to the elastic band the sharp teeth from the clamp cut into the cord.This product will not hold up. The corny silver ring sticker also fell off within minutes, and the adhesive is very weak.Simply put, this is another cheap, mass-produced, foreign product that is a WASTE of money.Do yourself a favor and look for a better solution, I know I will. This a cheap product that shouldn't be on any high-end digital camera."
3,Glue it!,"The price is good but quality is lacking.This is very usable but make sure you ""GLUE"" thoroughly""all parts"" of the attachment to the lens cap.Fell off because I missed gluing everything. LuckilyI found it on the ground."
4,works as advertised,"Not crazy about having a leash, but after losing the cap several times, I don't see how I can get by without one. Putting it in a pocket, or in the case, perhaps, but invariable it is misplaced anyway. As a previous buyer suggested, krazy glue definitely helps. BTW, I bought mine from Amazon marketplace A+R photo for one dollar and forty nine cents, no tax (despite being mailed from Brooklyn) and free shipping - can't beat that! Of course, it came in a regular white envelope without padding but in fine shape."
4,Well worth the price,"I bought this for my Canon Powershot SX10 IS and I'm sure without it I would have lost the lens cap by now. I haven't had any trouble with it, it works great!"
4,Great idea and useful!,"The lens cap holder does its job. It secures the lens cap to the camera. I have the Canon SX10 and lost my lens cap. When I purchased the replacement lens cap for $10 I also ordered this item. Upon reading some reviews, I decided to add a drop of krazy glue before applying the product to the new lens cap. It is definitely on the cap securely. Works for me!"
5,Never misplace or lose another lens cap!,"I take pictures while chaperoning the high school marching band, and this lens cap ""leash"" is the perfect solution when I need to quickly switch from photographer to chaperon. Just peel and stick to the cap and slide the strap over your lens. Easy! Does not get in the way while taking pictures or slide off the lens. Keeps the cap always close by. Great price and seller processed the order quickly."
4,Does the trick.,Loosing a lens cap sucks and thats what happened to me and the original ones are not cheap. Given the price of this cap keeper it does a good job in keeping the lens cap safe and attached to your camera at all times. Must buy for any camera.
2,String is too weak,I read the reviews and I decided to purchase th Bower Capkeeper and just add some crazy glue. i've only had the thing for about 2 weeks and today the elastic string broke. poor quality and i'm sorely miffed.
2,Failed after a year,"After a year of a very few usage of my lens, the part attached to the lens cap just broke apart. The glue is very good, so the paper glued to the lens cap still there, but the foam between the paper and the plastic circular thing just wearied out. Again, with a very few usage of my lens."
1,"Sure, it's cheap.. But that's all you get.","This is a cheap product and you get what you pay for. It wasn't on my lens cap for more than a week before the adhesive holding the cord to the piece on the cap had weakened and then detached. Now the little piece is attached to my cap, but with no actual purpose.It's cheap, but save your 2 bucks and put it toward a better product."
4,this product works...,"and since other reviewers were kind enough to mention that one must use a bit of extra glue when applying the saver button to the lens cap, all four I purchased have worked beautifully. The only reason for not giving them a solid stars is due to the fact that the product will not last as long as something made with better quality elastic and cord. Otherwise it's quite good and does the job as expected."
4,perfect tool to keep from losing your lenscap,I'd buy several of these so I can take my camera anywhere without fear of losing the lenscap. money well spent vs $40 for a new lenscap.
4,Good lens cap keeper,It was kind of tricky to stick on the Nikon LC-52 lens cap because it doesn't have much of a flat surface but it's doable. The lens cap keeper itself feels a tad flimsy (the strap is elastic) but it gets the job done. I chose the seller DeepDiscountsco and it arrived on time and in good conditions.
5,Really Grips,I was impressed with thislens cap keeper and I'm glad I ordered a few. I constantly lose lens caps because of poorly made cap keepers. But Bower Pro sticks to the cap and stays there; and I like that there's a long leader which allows me to push the lens cap further back on the camera's body to get it out of the way. This seller is very dependable - I got the items promptly - just when I needed them.
2,ok but cheap,"I thought this item was really a necessity for my SX10 is. However after using it for about two weeks consistently, it keeps coming off of my lens cap. Not the best quality unfortunately."
2,Great Idea.. Worthless adhesive.,"I purchased this Bower lens Capkeeper for my new Canon camera. I received the product quickly from the seller. After 2 days of use, the adhesive holding the button to the cap released. Luckily, it happened while in my padded camera bag so I didn't lose my cap. The best reviews for this product mention that they added super glue to strengthen the bond. I could have super glued my cap to a piece of string and tied it to the camera strap to achieve the same result. Won't be purchasing anymore products from Bower."
2,Love-Human Face-Big Business!,"This movie moves at a leisurely pace. The acting is average across the board, including that of Om Puri. It was delightful to see Boman Irani towards the end of the movie.The story is located in Canada (Toronto). Raj Malhotra (Shahid Kapoor) is a clientless independent Architect, who manages to get a prospect interested in what turns out to be a dog house project. Then, a ""ten dollar"" Crystal Grazer (Juhi Chawla) reveals that a lucky charm is imminent. Enter Priya (Vidya Balan), the lucky charm. Shahid's career starts to take off. In one of his ""make or break"" project proposals, there is talk of giving a human face to Big Business. There is also a Good Samaritan, a ""waving friend"".The story is a delightful, goodie - goodie, Bollywood love story, with no villainy or harshness. And, it has an happy ending. However, the songs are nondescript.You are not missing anything if you miss this movie."
5,A must,"If you're in an ochem class that uses the Vollhardt and Schore textbook, I very strongly recommend buying this solutions manual. For each chapter it provides a section-by-section summary of the most important points and for the end of chapter questions it gives very detailed explanations of the answers. If an answer has the possibility of being unclear, it will explain, draw arrows, etc to make sure anyone can understand it. My favorite part is that it warns you about ""tricks""; for example, in bold letters it will say tell you, ""make sure you DON'T do this here"", etc. Definitely worth the extra cost!"
5,Great guide!,"The guide was in excellent condition, just as stated, and I hope it will be helpful to me this fall."
5,Orgo Study Guide Review,"the delivery was timely, the book was in good condition, and the price was a good deal"
1,Why let the facts spoil a good story?,"Don't be taken in by historically-incorrect conspiracy theories. Seth Payson's book ""Proof of the Illuminati"" is based on John Robison's 1797 work ""Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the secret Meetings of Free Masons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies, collected from good authorities"", and Abbé Augustin de Barruel's four-volume ""Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire du Jacobinisme"", published in 1797 and 1798. Both books are riddled with factual errors and long discredited as being of any worth. But then, when did conspiracy theorists ever worry about the facts?"
1,Error in Team Color,"This hat when shipped to me came in the wrong colors of USC, my alma mater. It looked like a template for McDonalds rather than true Southern Cal Pride!!!"
1,Photo doesn't match item.,The hat didnt match the item. The color was completely different and not a school color.
1,just can't do it,"Ok Ok Ok, I know these guys are SOOOOOOOOO influential and all, but I really just can't feel this compilation. As a wise friend once told me ""Being the first to do something makes you incapable of being the best at it."" That is made readily apparent here. If you really like what you've heard from the Fall, go ahead and buy this. If you're going off someone's recommendation, think again."
1,Cross eyed owl! really?,"This owl came cross-eyed, and not just a little bit. It is such a disappointment when you receive irregular merchandise rather than first rate items like they show in the photos. I am very disappointed in this item and would not recommend it because you are not guaranteed to get one like in the photo. It was intended as a gift and I didn't have time to return it. Maybe you have time to gamble on getting a good one. I didn't."
4,Cute little buggar!,Fun stuffed animal. I bought it for a Harry Potter display. Had to work with his hair a bit as he was quite squished when he arrived. Looks great on a shelf not sure how it would hold up as a toy.
4,Good Trophy Owl,"Bought this owl as a ""trophy"" mascot for spirit day winners of elementary school .... winning classroom gets to ""host"" the mascot for a week. Have had it for 1 semester and the kids love it. It's switched classroom owners about 8 times and has held up well for being handled by so many students! Will definitely purchase this guy again if/when he becomes dingy enough to do so."
3,"Good size, good shape, but a little deformed in the head","This owl looks nice and is a good size but it came tightly wrapped in plastic, which totally mangled the head fluff. I had to try to re-shape it when it arrived and still it doesn't look perfect. But you can still tell it's an owl, and it's nice and soft."
2,Get what you pay for,"Fur fell out with gentle play. Cheap junk, not at all soft. I would not buy again and cannot recommend to anyone else."
4,great buy,This owl is soft and realistic. My grandaughter loved it. It is also large. She kissed and hugged it the minute she held it in her arms.
3,cute stuffed toy,"Its really cute,only 1 drawback though, it's hard to get to actually stand up,tends to fall sideways unless propped up against a corner of shelf etc,other than that its really quite cute!"
5,"Excellent, especially for the price!","I paid less than $9 for this owl and couldn't be more pleased with it! The fur is very soft, and the wispiness of the material on the face and especially above the eyes gives the effect of feathers from a couple of feet away. It is much more lifelike than other stuffed owls I have seen (as is the barn owl also by Aurora World). It feels like a very good quality stuffed animal, but is probably not durable (and washable) enough to be a good choice for a small child."
3,Cute owl,"My 2-year-old is obsessed with owls after a zoo trip so I bought this for him for Christmas. The construction quality is a little disappointing, the eyes are not perfect, and you have to style the ears to make it look like the picture. The feet are very firm, so it's not the best for cuddling, but stands up great! My son loves it despite the cons."
3,See it before you buy it,"The picture on the Amazon.com product page looks terrific. Mine arrived with a slightly squashed, asymmetrical face. I don't know why, it was shipped in a decent cardboard box. I am not able to fix it up by tugging, squeezing or pulling at it. Go to a toy store and look at it before you buy it."
4,Beautiful Eyes!,"My twin 2-year-old grandsons are very interested in owls. I wanted a stuffed toy owl that had BIG eyes and looked as realistic as possible. I bought 2 of these owls, one for each grandson. Although this owl is not squishy soft for a snuggle, it looks very realistic! The boys LOVE the eyes, which, face it...that's what makes an owl cool!! Sitting on a shelf in their room watching over them, the owls look wonderful. I let the boys play with the owls only when supervised because I want to put them up when they are finished so that the owls don't get stepped on, etc. Overall, I am happy with these owls...they LOOK great, even though they aren't really a snuggle owl....but I would rather have them look real. I use it as a chance to teach the boys to be gentle with ""animals"" and to take care of certain toys!!! It's all good!!!!"
2,Not impressed,"Appears to be crudely manufactured -- rough dull surface. Only way to stop it from buzzing/rattling loudly against the clipper was to put a large rubber band around both. If I ever get another, I'll try the plastic one."
5,Helping your child to become an international citizen,"I can highly recommend this book to anyone bringing up or teaching children in a multilingual environment. The book answers many questions with scientifically validated facts. Whilst leaving room for individual interpretation, the book provides descriptions of the various stages of a child's linguistic development and key indicators of skill level which the parent or teacher should be able to identify. Despite being packed with facts and information, the book is entertaining to read and uses everyday language."
5,Good Overview for the Average Educated Reader,"Tracey Tokuhama Espinoza's book is aimed at the educated parent who is trying to raise a child to speak more than one language. Unlike, many of the other books in this category, her book is not written for linguists or educators. She touches on the literature of bilingual and multilingualism but she does not overwhelm her readers with the essoteric details and obscure language of academia. If one wants to go into greater depth, Tokuhama Espinoza provides the links to more serious study.I found her book to be well written and at its heart optomistic. From her personal and observed experience, she understands and is enthused by the linguistic horizons that are open to small children. This is a good book to help one to begin thinking about these issues."
2,Is this thing on?,"I agree with many of the reviews here about this mat being not very hot. I don't even think its luke warm... I've had it plugged in for hours, feeling both sides, and I'm questioning whether its working at all. Two stars might be a little generous, but perhaps tropical means ""not even warm"" and I just didn't know. I have a Brazilian Rainbow Boa and although they don't like it very hot, I feel like she'll be a little chilly with this mat. Should I get the dessert edition?p.s. of course another major downside is the one-time use that comes with these self-adhering mats. I will stick to Flukers."
1,heatwave,does not work at all you could use a broken heating pad and get better heat than this thing no heat at all
1,doesn't work.,"generates no additional heat, I have a thermometer directly over the substrate heater (under a layer of substrate in fact) the temprature never changes by more than what would be expected naturally (never shifts more than 1 degree Fahrenheit inside of an hour or two this is in a 12ish gal tank at 76 Fahrenheit) do NOT buy this item, I plan on shipping it back and (hopefulness) getting my modey back, but refuse to bay more than the product is worth for shipping to do so, because guess what, that would be a free 15 buck for these jerks. don't let the company rob you DO NOT BUY."
5,Jane Eyre (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism),This was a gift but I was very excited how fast it was delivered! Apparently it's so good that I've had to search for the next book!
1,Not received,I dont really now if they are good since I ordered them and never received them even though I paid for them
1,Empty Box,"I received an empty box and then had to wait 3 weeks to get my money back. If you buy from Amazon, make sure it's actually Amazon seeling the item not a third party, because if there is a problem, you could have to wait up to 4 weeks to get your money back! Lesson learned!"
2,"Good keyboard, bad mouse.","The keyboard works great. Its a keyboard, exactly what i wanted. But the wireless mouse leaves GREAT DEAL to be desired. The software it comes with is on a Floppy disk, a drive for which i don't even have. I installed it on another machine and saved it to the network at my house and installed it on the computer for which it was meant to be used via the network. The mouse worked well for about two days, then began to not work at all. It could barely move the cursor an inch left or right, and not at all up or down. After reinstalling the software, rebuting, and re-doing the procedure to program the mouse to ""talk"" to the reciever, i had no help. I would not suggest this product due to the low quality of the mouse."
4,Dean Koontz,"I read this book about a year ago, the version I read was a reissue with Dean Koontz name. I thought it was a good story, though not the same as he usually writes."
5,Great Product,"This product arrived in a timely manner, contained treats, and is a great bargain. Thanks!!!"
5,Transcend SD Memory Card 2-gigabyte 150x,"I have only used one of the two in a Nikon D-80 so far. It is directly readable by my 9 of 2 reader built into my lcd screen, although I have not installed the Nikon software on my computer. This product allows me to take picture at four to five frames a second. It also holds 500 hi-res pictures per card. Since they were about $20 each, they were a good buy."
3,"Works, but not 100%","I bought this card to use in my Panasonic DMC-FZ20. No problems with it except when taking pictures in ""TIF"" format. The tif image is not saved properly for whatever reason. The image is shifted to the right (so what should be on the right appears on the left), and the colors change to a turquoise-ish pigmentation.But, taking JPG images and video's with the camera works flawlessly. I plan to keep the card and use it for that, and use a 1GB Lexar Platinum card for TIF's."
1,card failed after 1-2 years of use,"this card failed after regular use- most of the files on the card were suddenly corrupted and then the card could not be reformatted. after i purchased this card i tried to purchase a 4gb transcend card, which never worked, nor did one or two free replacements. the message is pretty clear to me, either solid-state memory isnt as robust as they claim it is, or transcend couldnt make a memory card to save their life."
5,"Superb quality, speed and price","The Transcend High Speed SD card uses more reliable memory technology than some cheaper brands and their controller chip is one of the fastest.I bought these SD cards because I wanted reliability and speed without the premium price associated with other brands.These cards work perfectly in my camera, they are super fast and were great value. There is nothing more to say!"
5,delivered next day,"I received a FED EX tracking notice and product was received by me, on the next day...came of of North Chicago...I was told 5-7 days..OutstandingAnd Card is as stated and new..."
2,Edward Whited,"It works but is just as slow as the cheaper 2 GB chips. I believe this is a hox and I don't plan to purchase anything any more through AMAZON.I got stung this time I won't get stung again.Sorry, you cannot help it you are just a holding house and not a quality distributor.have a nice dayUnited States address:Dr. Edward WhitedBox 2551Conroe, Texas 77301or1500 S. 3rs St (Apt.1)Conroe, Texas 77305Over Seas AddressEdward WhitedBox 520Saudi AramcoRas Tanura, 31311Saudi Arabia"
1,"Nice card, lock button vanishes over time","The card electronics is fine. Never had a problem. However, the lock/unlock tab eventually falls out and the card ends in perpetual READ ONLY state. I've tried to get the tab back in, and have concluded that my hands need to be 10 times smaller to do that.By comparison, I got Sandisk at the same time, with the same usage. All of my sandisk cards albeit more expensive, still work. I've had 3 transcends die, and I'm ditching the rest."
5,Excellent option,"I use this card on my Palm T|X and love its capabilities and speed. I store applications, games, documents, Audible books and movies on the card. Great capacity for many items.It is fast enough for a fairly demanding photographer as well since it can save so quickly in burst mode using my Kodak super zoom 5+ mega pixel camera."
3,Over-priced and only possesses a 1 year warranty,My teenage daughter purchased this for her digital camera. The card performs well but many less expensive Class 10 cards perform just as well and some even possess a limited lifetime warranty.I always prefer a lifetime warranty for such products irregardless of product performance.
5,Atmospheric and intelligent,"Beautiful CD. Great to see this guy release a full length. For fans of GOOD D n' B, this one will satisfy: flying through azure skys...Now, if only the DJs in America would kick the pipe and throw down music as decent as this, then maybe D'n B would start to get respect from the domestic techno community. Tech-step will always suck.If you ever enjoyed intelligent techno back in the day, ie 1992-1995, from the likes of Vapourspace, Speedy J, Orbital, and most of the releases on Intellinet and Telepathic, this CD belongs in your collection."
5,"""It's a state of mind for those who hear it...""",Big Bud: One of the best DJ/Producers to come out of the G.L.O. camp. An excellent album. A 70+ minute un-interrupted musical journey. Emotion-filled Drum and Bass that's sure to impress.
1,This CD was a real disappointment for any Patsy Cline fan!,"Unfortunately, the producer of this CD added strings and background singers to the original vocals. According to the information included with the disc, this was to make the songs more suited to the music tastes of the 80's. The result is ornate and syrupy. The wonderful characteristics of Ms. Cline's voice get lost in this recording. What a shame!"
1,Gillette Sensor Blades--Counterfeit,"I bought a ten pack of Gillette Sensor Excel blades and when I used the first one it seemed very dull, like it had been used way too long. I changed to a couple of others and they were the same. It was like having the hair pulled out of my face. Very painful. I returned them and then researched online and have seen stories about counterfeit blades. Not surprising since the prices are so crazy--at this rate they will soon be like pharmaceuticals. I have to buy the Excel blades online because I can't find them in stores since the manufacturers apparently plan to force us all to soon use 12 blades to shave when two is plenty. Who can even get five blades onto their face especially in those tight spots. I find the whole thing insane so refuse to play and just buy the old Excel blades online--but now this!"
5,Gillette Sensor Razors-Good Deal,Received these razors pronto and each one came with two blade cartridges making them an even better deal than I had anticipated.
5,Gillette Sensor Excel Review,"Still as good as they were years ago. Stopped using the Sensor Excell blades as they had become so expensive at all local stores, even Wal-Mart. Found these on Amazon at a great price and they were shipped in no time at all. Great shave again! Thanks Amazon!"
2,Gillette Sensor razor blades,I thought I was getting a good deal for my husband. They appear to be defective. My husband gets cuts every time he used them. They are the same brand that we buy in the store and he has no problem with those.
4,Makes you think,"I am a scrapbooker, so this book has helped me focus on what questions are important to record. Recommend this journal"
5,excellent self interviewing,I loved the first addition. I have used it in many situations as conversation starters. This is equally as quality and thought provoking questions. Makes one think! Thats never a bad thing.
1,DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"This product has coffee in it, my child has been up all night. Not fussing just wired and playing. Definitely not worth the teething relief it provides."
3,Not true to size,"I normally wear a size 11 shoe, and most shoes fit pretty well. These shoes however ran large, so they had to be returned. From the picture they are appealing to me. However when I actually got them I didn't like them as much. Keep in mind with the current promotions I also got them over half off. For white athletic style shoes you probably want to look at other brands, and stick to Ben Sherman for the more ""mod"" style."
5,Great Physics Book,I used this book in my college Physics I class. It's great. I am planning on becoming a physics teacher and I definatly want to use this book to teach from!
5,Learning with Mei-Mei is fun and easy!,"My daughter and I listen to this cd in the car while out and about. We both love listening to the songs, repeating after Mei-Mei saying the words in Chinese. My daughter( 28 months old) actually asks to listen to it.... "" Chinese"" please!The cd starts out with teaching you how to count to 10, next are 2 songs Little Ducks & Where are my Friends. Next you'll learn names for some of your body parts and then you sing the 1st verse of "" Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes"". The rest of the cd alternates between learning & repeating what Mei-Mei has said and then a song. My daughter loves the Two Tigers Song...which is strange because 1 tiger has no head and the other tiger no tail.The Cd is very much the same as the VHS or DVD of Speak & Learn Chinese With Mei-Mei. Mei-Mei's voice is clear and easy to understand as well as the children who are also on the cd. I just can't say enough nice things about this CD. You won't be sorry you purchased it!"
4,Overall very good learning CD,"I got this CD for my daughter because I read all the good reviews about it. It is overall a very good Chinese learning material. Lots of fun songs and the arrangement is not too stiff or boring. But I am not crazy about the teacher's singing voice, not very soothing and can be annoying to some people, thus the four star rating."
2,Not what I expected,"I got this CD to hear some traditional kids' songs and because of all the positive reviews, however, I was seriously disappointed. First of all, the audio quality is terrible and Mei Mei, while she seems to be a very nice person, has a dreadful singing voice that I simply can't stand. It ruins the songs, unfortunately. Second, the Chinese 'lessons' are extremely simplistic and not for kids who already speak any Mandarin. You learn to say a few common words, but this is no more speaking Chinese than just saying 'Bonjour' and 'Au Revoir' is speaking French. If you actually expect your child to become fluent in Mandarin (like my son, who is in an immersion program) I believe this CD is actually counterproductive since it asks the child to first think of the words in English.I gave this two stars since the booklet that comes with the CD is actually very helpful and includes all the words to the songs in pin yin."
5,Great for the car,"Our daughter loves to sing along to this CD while riding in the car. She's learning the words much faster than we thought she would. We have two cars and found ourselves moving it back and forth from one car to the other, so we bought a second copy. The songs are quite charming. And the lessons very practical."
3,Cringing,My daughter (3 years old) and I have listened to Miss Panda every day for the last month and love it. We've learned everything on the Miss Panda CD and I was looking for something similar. This CD had mostly good reviews. I really cannot figure out the 5 star reviews. I'm giving Speak & Sing Chinese a 3 star only because the lessons are good and the word pronunciation is very clear. My three year old will listen to it (although she prefers Miss Panda) but I just can't. Mei Mei's singing voice makes me cringe. Putting this CD on for our morning commute feels like self torture. From now on I'm going to put it on the ipod and give her headphones until I find a Mandarin CD that we can both listen to.
5,Can No idea put out a bad album???,"When your plan is to bring the sounds of AC/DC and Uncle tupelo together, It's a pretty damned ballsy musical endeavor believe me. Unitas pulls it off nicely. Unitas brings together members of Hot water music and Discount respectively, but if you're expecting a blend between the two, you're in for a huge disappointment. Alt-country mixed with punk and southern rock.Imagine if Chamberlain, Avail and Skynyrd got together to write an album, and you might come close."
5,the bomb,well this is a true elecro sound of the future with the class of a rock star of the 80 well trance deep house and tribal with a space of techno
4,Excellent adventure of espionage and intrigue!,"David Cook's classic series continues as the adventures locate the sinister town of Highport, the secret hideout of the Pomarj Slavelords. A quick, dirty raid in true hack-n-slash style will make things right, eh? Well, that's what the last pack of adventurers thought... Having slaughtered the orcs in Highport's sinister temple of Gruumsh, and their overlord, the adventurers journey into the wild Drachensgrab Hills, in search of a great fortress where the Slavers reign supreme. An intense, gritty classic of AD&D gaming for levels 4-7."
4,Great Timer,This is a great little time. Very sturdy. It fell from the top of my refrigerator onto a hard floor and it still works. My only criticism is I was hoping the timer would have been louder.
1,the timer . . .,. . . is erratic and inaccurate! It is a disappointment. I just wanted a timer that would beep me every four hours. Guess that was too much to ask.
1,DOA,I inserted the battery and the LCD display went on in a completely random mode. I removed and reinserted the battery several times and it never worked. I wrote to the mfg. They were sympathetic but did not offer and RMA. Words are cheap. It isn't worth the time out of my life to go to all the effort to return the thing. It is junk.
4,Almost perfect,"Needed a replacement timer for my Polder (melted it). The beeper notification has a nice, loud ring to it. Numbers are easy to read and the buttons are easy to use. Giving only four stars because when you press the start/stop button, the unit pops of the refrigerator because the magnet and clip are located in the middle of the unit. This location results in a teeter-totter effect when you press on either side of it. Of course, you can fix the problem by either holding down the other side with your other hand or putting something under the side with the start/stop button. No biggie - I kept it since all other stuff works well."
5,Excellent Timer,This is the perfect timer. I love the many features. The ring is clear and loud. I like that I can switch it to a regular clock. I also like the hour feature. Works very well.
5,I like it,"I didn't think I would when I bought it, but my standard dial timer had broken because the plastic had dried up with age. I can't remember when I bought that one. But this one out of the box, without reading instructions,, works for me. I don't like timers for the kitchen to be difficult. I suspect however that people who aren't used to electronics might stumble a bit with this one. I had to go get my gasses to read the buttons. But once set it had a loud ring and I could leave the computer room and go to the kitchen to turn it off (it will eventually turn itself off, but it's a long ring and you will wonder). I would recommend it for anyone who isn't startled by a bit more advanced kitchen timer technology. I, for instance, will NEVER use the memory or stopwatch features."
4,CDN TM8 Digital Timer and Clock Memory Feature,"It works as advertised, - one of the few 24 hour timers that I could find that was reasonable and not to complicated."
5,Timer,Love the timer! I am a Fight Attendant and it is great to use on flights. Hard to find a timer that registers over 99 minutes.
2,ONE OUT OF 2 WORKED,"I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE TIMERS AND ONE WORKS. I HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD ONE BUT I LOST IT. I LOVE THE TIMER; IT IS THE ONLY TIMER THAT I FEEL IS SO EASY TO WORK. I AM RETURNING THE TIMER TO THE MANUFACTURER BECAUSE IT HAS AWARRANTY ON IT. I WILL UPDATE AS TO WHETHER THEY SEND ME A NEW ONE.I KEPT THE BATTERY BECAUSE I HAVE TO PAY THE POSTAGE ON SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT WORK. WHEN I PUT THE BATTERY IN IT GOES BEZERK AND MAKES WEIRD NOISES.SO IF YOU BUY ONE AND IT DOES NOT WORK, SEND IT BACK. I HAVE JUST ORDERED 2 MORE FOR MY GRANDSON WHO HAS JUST BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES AND HE WILL NEED IT FOR TAKING SHOTS, ETC. HOPEFULLY THEY WORK. I HOPE TO CHANGE MY REVIEW TO MORE STARS. WE SHALL SEE."
3,Awesome Harmony!,A great quality CD and excellent harmony!I feel that all CD's are over-priced though and for that reason I give only three stars! Each individual can judge price for themselves.
5,A great book about international economics and power,"A very well written and thought out book about how countries become powerful and what happens to affect their power. The book covers a long period of the history of the development of nations, from the 16th century to the later part of the 20th. The focus is on economics and its relationship to power. One can more easily understand the current dynamics of the rise of China and consider its likely impact on the modern world and in particular the United States by understanding how the rise and fall of nations happened in the past, as described in detail in this book."
3,an excercise in futility,"This book reveals a lot of research and studies and is well recommended. To me, the job of the historian is to look at historical events retrospectively and come up with viable analyses. This has been the case for Macaulay, Prescott, Trevelyan, Churchill and Barbara Tuchman, great historians of our times. We human beings are not gifted with crystal balls to foretell the future. Paul Kennedy tried to use past events to predict the future (to look prospectively). As things unfolded since the publication of this book, a lot of his predictions were false amd looked silly. More are likely to come. It is time for Mr Kennedy to realise that what he tried to do is an impossible task. Researching and studying an historial event could be a really great exercise - (for example, the Conquest of Mexico by Prescott, The River War by Churchill and the Guns of August by Tuchman)"
