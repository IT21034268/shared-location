5,Great read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It was recommended by a friend and am glad I took the short time it took to read it. In fact, I have passed it on to others who enjoyed it as well. The text captures and reminds the reader of what the U.S. was founded on and by the individuals who made it great during the 20th century. It is truly a great read and I know I will read it again and again."
4,Great read for your staff...,"If you are a manager, make sure your staff reads this (but provide context, it can be misinterpreted!). If you are staff, make sure you take the message to Garcia by reading ""A Message to Garcia"". Easy, half hour read that is worth re-reading every once in a while."
4,getting it done,It is a great read; short and to the point about how to just take the ball and take it to the basket.
4,The Perfect Gift,Do you have a you man or woman about to graduate from college or to complete basic military training? This short and to the point book makes a great gift.
4,A few lessons of self-sacrifice and initiative,"Although Hubbard's main point is absolutely correct regarding the value of initiative from subordinates, he goes too far demanding honest and hard work for a boss, no matter what is the behaviour of the latter or the rewards! Life is much more complicated than ""taking a message to Garcia"" and very often people find excuses not because they are lazy or stupid but because they feel manipulated and unfairly dealt with from higher authorities. Many times the person who does the hard work is different from the person who reapes the profits and the glory! But I agree totally with the book's paragraph which states that no matter what other people say about you, your real worth and potential is always the same and nobody can change it."
3,The virtue of submission--,"In Hubbard's booklet lies the secret of service. It sounds simple, but so few people are able to swallow their giant egos to do it.Using the true story of a messenger in the Spanish-American War as an example, Hubbard teaches this lesson: when a superior asks you to do something -- no matter how difficult or crazy or impossible it may sound -- just go get it done. Don't say anything; don't make any funny faces; don't look to others for help -- just go and do it.In a society where authority is too often degraded, Hubbard's old-fashioned-radio-editorial-style essay reminds us that conformity can be good. I would qualify this by saying that any conformity should be conscientious conformity (you must not do something that goes against ethical principles).To anyone really considering buying this really, really short, really, really over-priced book: you can find it online for really, really free."
3,Disappointed with the Indy Publishing edition.,"Don't waste your money on the Indy Publishing edition of this book. No pictures, no maps, no dust jacket. It is no fun to read a full paragraph description by the author of an incident that was recorded with a photograph that is not in the book. A better investment would be the paper back edition."
1,Don't buy General Books edition,"Don't buy the ""General Books, LLC"" edition of this book. It was recreated using an ""Optical Character Recognition"" software, which means that there are errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc. It has no foreword, maps, pictures, or Figures, even though the original book included these things. In addition, about 7 pages filled with 1's and 0's, perhaps as a translation to figures or pictures. Buy the alternate edition with Huntford's foreword."
1,Not very good,"Scanned with an Optical Character Recognition program and poorly done at best. Some sections are incomplete or unreadable The title sort of suggests the actual assault on the South Pole. The title should have not included the words ""The South Pole(1):"""
5,MasterPiece.,"Wonderful. Strong. Beautiful. It is a great book. You end up thinking that the five hundred pages are not enought. Amundsen is the project management himself. It is a pleasure to read such an adventure in a such complete edition, with all maps, photos, cientific info, etc. Highly recommended."
2,wrong reviews..,just a note to say that 2 of the reviews here are on the wrong production!! the Marta Domingo version is the one with Ainhoa Arteta as Magda! i have not seen the video displayed on this page so ignore my ratings.
3,NYC PRODUCTION,"SIMPLY PUT THE NYC OPERA PRODUCTION OF ""LA RONDINE"" WAS WONDERFUL. IT IS A SHAME THERE IS NO DVD OF THE ORIGINAL THAT AIRED SOME TIME AGO WITH ELIZABETH KNIGHTEN. BEVERLEY SILLS CONSIDERED THIS ONE OF HER FAVORITES. THE SECOND ACT WAS LITERALLY, A SHOW STOPPER. ACT THREE WAS AS OPERATIC AS CAN BE.I ALSO THINK MARTHA DOMINGO'S ENDING DETRACTS FROM THE NATURAL CONCEPT."
5,Should have been nominated for a Grammy.,I can't believe that she wasn't nominated. Another artist on her label who is equally good was nominated last year. Her name is Carla Cook. LaVerne Butler is also on the MAXJAZZ label and has a fantastic CD. I've seen all of these artists in person and am impressed by the quality of production and their phenomenal voices. Rene in particular exhibits a wide range of songs and styles and her choice of songs is challenging and comforting at the same time.
5,One of a Kind,"With the high volume of anecdotal books on Christmas, it is hard to find an author who takes the time to examine primary sources and check the facts. The World Encyclopedia of Christmas is a rare find, for Dr. Bowler takes the time to carefully examine traditions, old and new, with a fresh and insightful perspective. I recommend it for all audiences, academic or otherwise, because Bowler's humor is enough to sustain all levels of interest.Kate Penner--Yale University"
5,What bebop with guitar and organ is all about,"This is a really realy nice blowin' date in a traditional organ guitar setting. Not so traditional to be real because here we have a third solo voice, the magic trumpet of Howard McGhee, a monster bopper that needs no introduction. At the organ we have the album star Don Patterson, on the guitar a terrific Pat Martino. Year is 1968. The selection is strong, so strong. Monk, Parker a blues from McGhee, another original by him and that's it. I love this album. The Donna Lee version is one of my all time favourite. If you want to study the tune, going inside it, feling the changes, this version is perfect. Solos are amazing. The young Pat Martino showed that he had a long and successful road in front of him. One of those right and damn cool albums your neighbours envy you for."
2,Depressing...,"While Scarecrow was well written, it was depressing beyond its necessity. I realize that this was the goal of Jabanoski in writing this book, but all he does is give a one-sided guilt triping rant to the rest of the world. He offers little on how to fix what he believes is broken, and makes it seem as though all the good guys are actually bad guys. Unlike with Jabanoski's previous genius writing, I was extremely disappointed. If you are a liberal and in need of a good guilt trip that'll make you lose all hope, I would recommend this to you."
1,What's In A Name? Get It Right!,"I would urge that the producer/director of this ""documentary"" (that may have been updated after the loss of ""Columbia"" to make it more up-to-date),spell the name of the orbiter ""Columbia"" correctly on the title & cover of the film. ""Colombia"" is a country in South America, not a Space Shuttle Orbiter.As a ""Space Worker"" myself, I do not find that error very encouraging about the accuracy of the film nor would it entice me to buy it!."
5,Others Missing the Point,"All of these negative reviewers are missing the point. This book was written to show the interesting parallels between Danielle Steels life and the characters in her book. The book doesn't go out of its way to say that Danielle is a bad person - it's just saying, ""look, her books are a lot like her life."" You people should just relax and enjoy the parallels between life and fiction. This is a great book, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I'm also a Danielle Steel fan - I've read all of her books - and I now look back at them with a different eye, which is fun!"
2,I was very surprised,"I didn't know Danielle Steel was married to two ex-cons. I enjoy reading her books and will continue to do so, but it really bothered me that someone who writes the way she does could have gotten involved with two shady characters. I found it interesting how she took scenes out of her own life to write her books. Makes me want to sit down and write a novel myself!"
3,"Great product, but unused","The book is in great condition and appears to contain a plethora of necessary information for modeling lakes, streams, etc. Unfortunately, I have not sat down to read this book yet because limnology is not covered within the material of this text, and a solid understanding of that aspect is required prior to complex applications such as water-modeling."
3,Amazing!!! .....Until it broke :(,"Saw this on TV just as I was starting to remodel my new home and decided to give it a shot. Got both large and mini models for 19.95 I beleive. Worked great for a while. Is fantastic for getting into outlet boxes because you stick it ""nose in"" rather than having to get the wide flat side of a traditional stripper in there. However, many of the components are plastic, I could tell it was cheaply made when I got it, and it broke well before I finsihed replacing the outlets in the house. Now the outlets stand unfinished because I can't face busting my knuckles with the old stripper :(I sure wish someone would make a quality version of this tool. The concept is fantastic and I would gladly pay $30 for solid version."
3,nice but doesn't fit kids glasses,Bought for my 5 year old who just got glasses. Cute but doesn't work with kids glasses - too wide and the glasses don't slide down over the nose.
3,Too thin warped easily,We purchased a full set of the Cuisinart Quantanium coated cookware (piece ata time) and noticed that some pieces are thinner than others.The thicker pieces are nicer and distribute heat better.This particular piece was too thin and so we returned it.We like the Quantanium surface because it is strong and easy to clean butthe 11-inch squar griddle warped the first time it was exposed to heatso it was returned.
2,Uneven surface - wobbles,"The griddle leans toward the weight of the handle, so any liquid (oil, eggs, etc.) moves toward that side. Very frustrating! The surface itself is wonderful and non-stick. I use metal spatulas all the time with no scratching."
1,Warped after only a few uses,"Pros:Wonderful non-stick surface. After almost a year of use it hasn't scratched at all, but I use only wood or silicone utensils.Perfect size for frying several eggs, pan-searing large fish fillets, hamburgers - youname it.Cons:Leans toward the handle so ""runny"" foods (eggs, pancakes, sauces) don't stay put.After about 5 uses I noticed it would not sit flat on the burner and discovered that it is bowed down in the center, kind of like a shallow bowl.Cuisinart customer service will replace the pan if it is defective but you must pay to ship it to them, plus pay $7 to cover the shipping cost of a new pan. At that price I don't think it's worth it to just receive the same pan that will probably have the same problems."
2,Handle too heavy,"I purchased this griddle to use on my new glass-top stove. The griddle doesn't stick, cleans up easily but......the handle is so heavy the griddle will not sit level on the burner! I have to hold it up manually or try to find something just the right height to hold up the handle in order to cook a pancake. I have not tried to use it for anything else, as cooking one large pancake at a time in the middle of the griddle is so time-consuming.I love my other Cuisinart cookware, but am disappointed in this piece.Cuisinart Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 11-Inch Square Griddle"
1,Not worth the money,Product can't stand the heat - heat distribution extremely poor - gets hot and the non-handle side raises up off the cooktop. Definitely not worth the purchase price.
5,Great Griddle!,"Solid construction. Non-stick surface really works & cleans well after use. One of the reviews suggested that the handle was heavy and caused the griddle to tilt. Unless your stove or floor is lopsided, doesn't happen. I find myself buying more and more Cuisinart products."
2,For use with metal utensils?,"I just got the griddle and tried it for the first time. I followed all instructions (cleaning, low to medium heat) and I used an OXO silicone flipper for the pancakes that were made. After clean up (hand wash with a fresh dish cloth) I find scratches in the surface. Really? With using a silicone utensil and a cloth and making pancakes? And they boast that the surface is designed for use with metal utensils. . . fat chance. Back this goes -"
2,Good while it lasted,"This griddle was good while it lasted. We've had this for about 2 years now and it desperately needs replacement. The non-stick has started peeling and it is difficult to clean. Moreover the surface has warped though that isn't a big problem for a gas range, it does cause any oil/butter to collect on the sides instead of the center."
3,A little disappointing,"It's nonstick and the price was reasonable, however it warped a little in the middle so it no longer is exactly flat on our range. This causes some uneven heating. I'd probably look elsewhere if I was to buy another one."
3,Working but .......,"It seems to scratch real easy --- and I am careful. The Calphalon Hard anodized hold up better, but stains easier...."
1,Buyer Beware,"Beware of the publication date...reprint by Wipf and Stock of the original from 1955. This vocabulary by no means contains any contemporary theological German. It may help you to read Luther's German Version of the Bible, if that is your goal. Otherwise, you will receive no help for theological German from the last 50 years. Please evaluate carefully your German vacabulary needs before purchasing this book."
5,A warm greeting from the homeland,"Patrick has a very clear voice and it really shines through on this CD. The arrangements are kept nice and simple mostly with gentle percussion, guitar and a children chorus. For someone who grew up with the German style Christmas culture, this presents a piece of home.Having lived in the US since 1985, this is the first CD I go for when the holiday time approaches.Happy Holidays!!!"
2,good for entertainment,Wanted to watch something to pass the time and this succeeded. I'm very much into Anime but this didn't hold my attention at all. Will give to someone else for free or a yard sale. Definitely wouldn't watch it again...
3,I Love black cat can we get a new series,"I loved this episode it shows the true colors of every one on the series. The ending was open for a new season even, which I can only hope they will try to bring out. I did get a little confused on some parts tawords the final fight and had to think, BUT I adventually understood so with that remark I gave it 3 stars"
1,Horrible!,"This is the worst collection of songs I have ever heard, and I have been around in the times of Helix and Britny Fox. This is a case of a band listening to way to many Styx albums."
1,Very Disappointed!!,This music is just not something you would hear in the US. 70's music is just not being played on the radio. I was disappointed when I compared this to Metal Church. Vanderhoof is Metal Church. It was just very misleading. I hope Vanderhoof's next project is more worthwhile.
2,A long intro for a short plot,"The introduction promises a daring adventure of an ex-commando to raid a heavily guarded island fortress. The commando, whom the readers were told to have no choice due to severe economic circumstances. It appears to promise to be another exciting tale of infiltration like Alistair Mclean's ""Where Eagles Dare"".Unfortunately, it turned out to be only a quarter of the tale. The author took more than half the book to reach the recruitment of the hero into the rescue mission - which were told in the introduction. The raid itself was barely a chapter's worth. Readers can spot the double-cross miles away.Last but not least, what is the judgment ?This book would have been given 3 stars for fair writing if it hadn't been for the misleading title and introduction."
5,Higgins is really good,"I've read many Jack Higgins books over the years, and I recently read (or perhaps re-read) this one. It was a good action tale with tough guys and beautiful, smart women. Just what one expects from Jack Higgins. There is no boring backstory you have to slog through, just terse dialogue and tense action. A very good read."
5,I LIKED THIS BOOK ALOT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.,I liked this book very very much. I liked the way Timithy talked. The part when Timithy died was kind of sad. It was also sad when Phillip became blind. I wish that the person who made this book would make another story this exsiting.by. Alex Lacas
5,THIS WAS AN OUTRAGIOUS STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was a totaly cool story man! I was amazed when I found out that Phillip made it on his own because he was blind and he was all alone because Timothy died.I think that it was a great lesson about that we should not judge others by what color they are on the outside the inside is all that matters.I recomend this book to everyone it is an outragious book man !!!!!!!!!!!!!! TYPED BY:CLAIRE HUTCHINSON
4,I really like this book,"I am the only one in my class who has read the whole thing,I think the end was way good.The only thing I didn't like was how the author concluded the book.I liked it so much I didn't want it to end.I think it would be cool to have Phillip return to ""The Cay"".I really wish I could read the sequal of it.I would recommend that everyone should read it.I didn't want Timothy to die !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I think it is a wield book.,"I think the cay is a good story, but it gets boring while there on island. Every day they do the same thing. Like Timothy allways catches the Langosta.I like how the book has lots of detail.I also like how Phiilip is bline.but all together its a wield book from, Jaron"
3,"It didn't have much action,but it was a good book so far.","If it had more excitement, it would be a better book.The only action so far is when they got ship- wrecked and stranded on the cay.To bad nobody can save them because of the coral,but they could send airplanes or even helicopters to save them."
2,The Cay,"The CayBy John SamuelsThe book I'm giving a review on is the book called The Cay by Theodore Taylor. The book is about a kid named Phillip who meets this old man named Timothy who saved his life and now they are stranded in the ocean. Then they find a cay (small island) in the Caribbean that they live on. Phillip is a medium size kid that is normal, Timothy is a tall African American that is very strong, and Stew Cat is a cat that is very wise and gets Phillip and Timothy to have a little bit of fun. The theme of this story is friendship because they have to become friends on the island to make it through. I thought the book was okay because it had some ups and downs. I would recommend this book because it displays great survival skills."
5,"Really, Really Good Book!","Phillip was a twelve year old during World War 2. He was living on an island in the Caribbean. The Germans were attacking the island so he and his mother decided to leave. His boat gets torpedoed and he gets separated from his mother. He was on a lifeboat with a big man called Timothy and a cat called Stew Cat. They paddle to an island, but Phillip got hit in the head with a board and became blind. This story is about how he and Timothy survive on the deserted island and face many dangers including giant fish, hurricanes, and starvation. It is a very interesting book and would be enjoyed by all. It is a little easy and is short, but it is very good."
2,The Cay,"The CayBy Theodore TaylorThe book I'm giving a review on is the book called The Cay by Theodore Taylor. The book is about a kid named Phillip who meets this old man named Timothy who saved his life and now they are stranded in the ocean. Then they find a cay (small island) in the Caribbean that they live on. Phillip is a medium size kid that is normal, Timothy is a tall African American that is very strong, and Stew Cat is a cat that is very wise and gets Phillip and Timothy to have a little bit of fun. The theme of this story is friendship because they have to become friends on the island to make it through. I thought the book was okay because it had some ups and downs. I would recommend this book because it displays great survival skills."
3,A book I'll remember . . .,"During World War II, Philip, his mother, and his dad's lives are threatened by the schooners attacking their island... Curacao. Philip and his mother leave the island on a boat for safety. But, the ship is sunken and Philip finds himself on a raft with a cat, a man, and himself... Will Philip survive?I thought the book was about 3 stars because I like more medieval and exciting books like The Redwall Series. However, it has a plot that keeps you reading and is exciting. I think this book's difficulty is about 4th to 6th grade level because its vocabulary isn't that extreme but its plot and details are a little intricate. So, I think someone who liked history and stories based on true tales would like this book. It's a book you'll remember!"
4,The Cay,This is a very good book that everyone should take time to read. I like this book because it teaches us to work hard and never give up hope. I would reccomend this book to everyone.
4,Interesting and realistic,"It was interesting becuase it tells you how people tryed to get away to live a beter life while not geting caught,and its realistic becuase of the use of wording that the auther used, you would get the perfect picture in what the auther is telling you."
5,Blind...But Now I see,"Phillip, a 12-year-old boy, saw Timothy as a stupid, ugly old black man. It wasn't until Phillip became blind that he could actually ""see"" the real Timothy. This is a fast-paced, action fiction story set during World War II in the Caribbean Sea. All reference to war and bombs cease when Phillip and Timothy are shipwrecked, alone, on a deserted island. Their adventures there include survival, tropical storms and a revelation of the roots of prejudice. A very touching story. Theodore Taylor wrote this book in the 1960s and, in recent years, the sequal, Timothy of the Cay."
3,The wounderful story of the Cay,Well I think it is a great book. It is werth the time to read this book. You would like it when you read it in your spare time. It is exiting and it is a mystery book. If you read the book you will want to kept reading this book because it is to good to put down to go to sleep. That is how exiting it is to read. It is a cool book. You will be glad you read his book.
4,Stranded,"The Cay was a great book. Heres a little about it. Phillip, an 11 year old white, blind boy who is prejudice was stranded on an island with a cat and a black man. The cats name is Stew. The blacks mans name is Timothy. He is sort of slow, but Phillip finds him to be a wonderful man. When something tragic happens Phillip is left with a hole in his heart.I would recommend this book, The Cay, by Theodore Taylor, to anyone who loves adventures."
4,Excellent for class reading!!,"Our class just finished this book a couple of days ago. It was a great book with excellent vocabulary in it. It might not be one of the best books you ever read but, I suggest you read this for the summer or in your free time. In this book, a young boy named Phillip, which will become blind later on, and an old black man with excellent survival skills which is Timothy. They both get stranded on a cay, and Phillip is a bit prejudice, but everything changed while they were on the cay. In this book, you can learn not to judge a book by its cover, that's the lesson I learned. So I said, this is not one of the best books in the world but, you should check it out someday. Other books I recommend is: Sign of the Beaver, Popper's Penguins, The Mayflower, and soo much more I forgot!! All those are great for a group or class reading together. I recommend those books for 3rd-6th grade."
3,The Cay,"The Cay is a book that sort of has random subjects that are identified by the author, but it feels like they are choosen out of the blue. The Cay was not the best book I had ever read. There was nothing making curious about what is going to happen next. The story wants you to put yourself in the characters place to feel what they felt, so if you don't like doing that, don't read this book. Personally, if this book was not assigned by my teacher, you would not see me with this book. But it depends on what sort of book you like, and if you like stories that are very strait-forward and not very intense, it recomend this book to you."
3,The cay,The book is about a boy named phillip who gets stranded on an island with a black man named Timothy. Timothy has a anccent and cant speak as well as other humans. they have to go threw many troubles during the time that there on the island. They have a hurricane that goes over the island and Timothy gets nocked out. I like this story becuase it is very exciting and makes me want to read more about it.The theme on this book is about racism and being predjudice against black or white people. The plot is that Timothy and Phillip are trying to stay alive on the island since they never know what could happen to them. They go threw many troubles on the island and have trouble getting food at some times. In the end Phillip ends up getting rescued but unfortunatly Timithoy ends up dying.
5,My Favorite Book,"I am a 38 years old and an avid reader. Out of the hundreds of books I have read in my lifetime, The Cay stands out as the very best. I first read it as a child, and several times since then. It truly is a beautiful story. I love this book."
4,The Cay,The book The Cay was a great book. It had it ups and also had its downs. It was still a great book though. The two main chracters were Phillip and Timothy. Phillip was 10 years old and Timothy was about 62 years old. At the begging of the book there was a war were Phillip and his mother lived. So they had to leave on a boat. Read this book to find out what happens to Phillip and his mother.
2,Survival,When I started reading the Cay I didn't like it but when I started reading it I kinda liked it. Not that much but I didn't really like it that much. I'm sorry if I heart your feelings really I'am the only part I liked from The Cay is the part when Timathy died. I like bloody things.
3,Do you like to sleep.,"Over all the Cay was a good book. It had some draging parts in the story,but a good message. Thye message was team work and treating people with the upmost respect, despite your differances. Someday you may need that persons help, and in a bad situation differsncs don't matter."
3,A Dull Book,The Cay by Theodore Taylor was an interesting book. It had lovely morals and lessons such as people should not be judged by what they looked like and things of that sort. I thought the book grew dull though. The story took place on one small cay in the middle of nowhere. Philip was hit on the back of his head while fleeing from a German U-boat and became blind. He was stranded on a small cay in Devil's Mouth with an old ugly black man. Philip was taught to hate blacks and he thought that anyone of a different color was not as good as he. When Timothy was killed in a Tempest Philip had to learn how to survive on a small island on his own. If Theodore Taylor had found more interesting and new things for Philip to do the book may not have grown so dull.
1,"Pointless, poorly written, and drawn out over 144 pages...","I didnt really like this book, I read it in 3 days .... The book wasted so much time. They spend 3 or so chapters on a raft, so much wasted time. The final setting for the book lasted probably 11 chapters and it was spent mostly describing. BORING."
4,The cay,"The CayI thought at the start of the book this was going to be good. Theodore Taylor was going down the right track with the exciting background,Philip Getting separated from his parents on his way back to Virginia from the town of Willemstad, a town in South America their ship is torpedoed by German U-boats coming because of World War II Philip gets hit on the head and awakens to find that he is on a raft separated from his parents with no one except a cat named Stew-Cat and a West Indian and racially explained ""negro"" (sorry for any racial names)and to top it all off he goes blind! Being stranded on a cay in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a keg of water and stale crackers Philip thinks he is doomed!This book has an exciting start and a heartwarming end, it will keep you wanting to read it over and over again!Preston Amato of elgin"
4,Welcome To The Cay,The Cay by Theodore Taylor: This is a very interesting book. Taking place during WorldWarII. It was very entertaining. The main part of this book is a boy gets stuck on an Island with nothing but a cat and an old black man. Soon a hurricane strikes the island. The old black man ends up dead but hey everyone dies in life.
4,It was exciting throughout the middle and end of the book.,"I thought the book was a little slow in the beginning, but became exciting when the ship was sunk and Timothy, Stew Cat, and Phillip were on the little wooden raft. It got even more exciting when they were stranded on the island.I learned from the book that you can't always do everything yourself, but you need to rely on other people for help sometimes."
5,"Really good ,very adventurous and heartstopping.","An exciting story. Phillip was a good charecter ,and Timothy is very interesting."
3,The Cay,I liked the book because it show how a boy grew into a man by taking on responsbilities. He was blind so that show that anyone can do anything by taking on their own responsblities. It also informed me the many ways to use a product from nature and find many uses of it. It was a very useful book with alot of information that could be helpful and used in every day life. I shows how strong a friendship can grow even if at first you didn't like someone but showed you the true them and not just how people say and think they act. If someone would take their life for you so that you could live than I would call that a good almost best friend. I really Enjoyed this book and it was rather interesting.
4,I really liked this book,"You'll love the Cay if the thought of being stranded on a island interest you. this book is about a kid named Phillip who got in a ship reck and ended up on a raft, with a man named Timothy they soon ended up on a island called the Cay. They eventually learned how to hunt, fish, gather fruit, and build a hut. So if you want to read a interesting story the cay is a wonderful book to read."
3,The Cay,"After having read the book of a boy lost at sea named Phillip, who to me was a very adventitious boy with lots of courage. Turned out to be interesting and good reading. This was a summer assingment which was rewarding and educational."
5,I think this is a good book because of the freinds,I think you should treat African- Americans the same way you treat your best freind. That is why I like this book because even though Timothy is African-American and Phillip is American they are still freinds. They are such good freinds that Timothy gave his life forPhillip's survival. It is the best book I have ever read. Read this book.
2,A LESSON IN CHANGE,"Taylor puts the two most different individuals in the same drastic situation of life and death. Phillip, who has grown up being told to stay away from blacks, is rescued by Timothy, who is an older black man. The novel is a little bit Robinson Crusoe and a little Helen Keller. Phillip goes through many emotions that the readers may laugh about because they can relate to the absurdity-one example is his exaggerated selfishness. Phillip is forced to change, but does it willingly & in his own time. For as Timothy would say, ""I'm all you've got""(but with his accent). This is a sweet book about a wonderful friendship forged on circumstance and tragedy."
2,"It was OK,it was tense in some parts.I liked that.","If ""Batman"" was in it, it would of been better. I liked how they used things that could really happen.But it was a little boring in some parts. It could have been better if there was like a spy and things like that ,because I like action.But it was pretty good other wise.If a huge bunch of monkeys were in it, and they all came and wiped out there little hut and sucked out their inner organs and ate their brains with ketchup on a silver platter it would have been awesome.or if the monkeys would have boiled their heads in acid and squeezed their innerds out, And other things like that!!"
4,Why this book inspired me,"This book inspired me by perservering. The young boy on the island never gave up after he became blind. For example, he asked the elderly man to show him how to survive on the island. This helped me in school because even though something might happen to me I shouldn't give up."
1,slow moving,"Phillip and his family live on the island of Curacao during WWII. Phillip's mother believes that they should leave the island and go to American for safe shelter. So, Phillip and his mother leave the father, and while on the boat voyage to America the boat sinks. Phillip is separated from his mother and he gets blinded. He gets stranded on a cay with an old mean black man whose name is Timothy. They have to work through problems to survive with nothing but a keg of water, a bit of chocolate, and natural resources. A big storm occurs and catastrophe hits. One big question is who dies Timothy or Phillip?I would NOT recommend this book because it is very boring and the main characters are dull. It is boring because the story seemed just to be about a spoiled brat and a black man who have problems with each other. To me the characters are dull because they are one-dimensional. Lastly, people who like slow moving realistic fiction books will like ""The Cay""."
1,Read Huckleberry Finn instead,"This is required reading in school. Children don't seem to like it though. In my opinion it is a 3rd rate ""Huckleberry Finn"" book. ""Huckleberry Finn"" is a real classic, read that instead, and forget about ""The Cay"". Teachers, please don't force our children to read this book, read the classic!"
1,I was forced to read it!!!,"Oh my God! This book was so boring. I would have rather watched grass grow. The characters were not likable at all. I found myself cheering when Timothy died. There are many dessciptions of Phillip clutched to Timothy's naked body. So many of these referances that my friends and I started calling it ""The Gay"". The racial thing wasn't that big a deal. Like OMG!! Phillip dosen't like black people, now he does! I'm shaking from the experiance. DON'T READ IT."
1,The Cay,I thought the Cay stunk on a scale from 1 to 5 I give it a 1. Because the guy who told the story was blind. I wouldn't recommend this book because it's plain and boring and there is no action.They just sit on the island and try to get saved.
1,This book did not have enough action in it.,"I did not like this book at all. I thought it was a dumb. I hope you never read it. You will be boring. But I did like the part where Timothy said ""That be true"". But thats the only part I liked. I don't know why Timothy had to die. That's not right. Or when the plane past him. SUMMER DEASON"
2,A Mediocre Book at Best.,"I only read the book last year, but I can barely remember most of it. That's how good it was. The book seemed to drag on for a long time. I remember being really annoyed that the author didn't give many descriptions. This made it hard to understand why a character said or did certain things. The descriptions usually came up a few chapters later, but then I'd have to reread material to understand it.Anyway, I also found the book hard to follow and visualize. I didn't understand the hurricane scene well. I had to reread it and have it explained to me by my teacher before I finally got it. I don't reccomend the book unless you have a lot of patience, or if it's required."
5,This is a very cool book.,I like this story because it was an awesome and cool book. I liked it all but when Timothy died but the book ended up being good. r Reviewed by: Megan Russell
3,This is a average book,I thought this book was okay nothing real great. But in the part with the hurricane I thought I was in it.The auther decribe it so well.But parts I did not like when Timothy called Phillip a ugly blackman I did not like the behavior of Timothy. I would rememed this book to people that like adventure.
3,It was very thought provocing and origenal.,Since it takes place in the 1960s there is alot of diologe based on the war and class diffirences. I liked it mostly because of the history based text.It is a good book(as far as books go).
3,The cay,"Phillip a 12 year old boy who lives on the small island of Curacao until the island is bombed and his mom wants to leave. The cay is a book about adventure and survival. I give the Cay ***stars, because I think the book had great ideas and the author expressed them well but I think that he could use a lot more detail to certain passages. I recommend this book to kids of all ages and even adults who are looking for a decent read. I think the ending could be fixed up and tell more about the parents. I like the way that Phillip ended up with a Black Guy instead of his mom that was a nice twist for me. But the ending was pretty predictable.(For me)"
3,GOOD BOOK,"The Cay is a good book and I found it interesting. The characters are Phillip and Timothy and Stew Cat.I thought it was interesting because Phillip becomes blind. There are lots of things in the story. It is World War 2 and when the ship Phillip and his mom are on gets torpedoed, Phillip gets stranded on an island with Timothy and crackers, chocolate and their clothes..................................................................................................... .......will they survive? What happens? Read The Cay and you will know."
4,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!,"The Cay is a great adventure book about a twelve year old boy named Phillip who lived in the time of WWII on a small island of Curacao in a town called Williamsted. On his way back to Virginia where he use to live, Phillip gets stranded on an island with a big black man and a cat and all they had was chocolate, matches, water and the clothes on their back.I liked this book because it has great descriptions like when he described Timothy, the black person he got lost at sea with. I also thought the book deserved a good rating because it teaches you a great lesson about racism."
4,Good book!,"I rated The Cay a four*star because the author, Theodore Taylor had great descriptions of the characters, he told the reader everybody's feelings and why they did or didn't feel that way.The Cay is a great adventure; it is about a 12 year old boy named Philip who lived on the island of Curacao in a town called Willimastead during WWII. In the book Philip gets stranded on an island with a black man named Timothy, and all they have are matches, water and some chocolate. Philip will have go through major challenges with Timothy to try to survive. Will he survive or will he not? Read this book to find out!"
3,The Cay Review,"I like the Cay, but at the beginning it was really slow and boring. I started getting into it when Phillip and his mother got split up because of the torpedo. I hated Stew Cat because I hate cats in general. It gives a great message saying DON'T BE PREDJUDICE!!! It tests Phillip on survival, strength, and friendship. I liked how in the end, Phillip wasn't prejudice. (I would give this 3 1/2 stars but they didn't let me)"
3,The Cay,"I think The Cay could have been a little more interesting than it was.Such as, whene phillip fell of the raft Timothy could have killed the shark for some food ,whilethey were stranded.I also think it could have been alittle more understandable,because I thought that Timothy sent Stew Cat away on the raft before the hurricane,but whene the hurricane came Stew Cat was there.I think the most interesting part of the book was how Phillip could surrvive on an island by himself while being blind.I Think that I would recomend this book to grades sixth and up.Iwould also recomend it to someone else because ther taste in reading might be different.But on the other hand it was a good book!"
4,The Cay,"I think that The Cay is a very good book. It could use a little bit more detail. I thought it was layed out good, but the book could use some pictures. They should have said a little bit more about what happened to Philip at the end of the story. I thought it was avery interesting and very detailed book. The detail made you picture what was happening throughtout the whole story. the way they worded the whole story is fasinating. How he said the words of Timothy is amazing. I like Timothy the best because he says the most interesting phrases. It's like I could almost understand Timothy better than Philip. My favorite part was when Philip got saved by a ship. I would recommend this book to someone to read. I think that grades four through six should read this book."
3,the cay,"this was not a very good book and i would not advise any one who cares about their money to buy it. Its a waste of time and there are no parts which make you want to keep on reading, or have you wondering what is going to happen next and since it i an adventure story there should be plenty of those. the entire story seemed to be a bit rushed expecialy the end. it is a good novel study book because you can leave it and then come back and read it later but apart from that...it aint very good."
3,Good But Not Good Enough,"The Cay is an ok book but it could have been better. The book sort of dragged on for a while and it was like, oh, ok, what next? I liked the whole twist in the end though, when Timothy died all of a sudden, that put some spice in to the story.The ending was really dull! I mean, come on! The author just wanted to finish the story, he didnt put alot of effort into it at all. I mean, after all those failiures, he just gets rescued, just like that. It's not the way you make a good book and definately not the way to make a good ending. On whole the book is not on my top 50 list. The author needs to put more action into the whole book, and if he did, it would have made more of an impact to the readers. Sorry dude, it's good, but not good enough!"
3,The blinding truth,"This was a pretty good book. This was good because it deals with how people judge before actually knowing them, or get to know them and think they're annoying. A sailor, a small boy, and a cat get shipwrecked on an island and see how different and similar they are. Soon something happens to one of them and damages thier seeing maybe forever. After the sailor, who is african, dies of a disease and now the kid is left to fend for himself alone with a cat as company.Being blind he soon has trouble around the island, and later knows what to do. Aboat soon comes and saves him and takes him to his family, but he has to wear glasses forever."
4,The Blind Island,It is about a boy named Philip and his frenid Timothy who got in a shipwreck and floated on a raft to a island. But diring the shipwreck Philip hit his head on the a part of the ship and made him blind! So it's a great story and I hope you get this book!The mystery of the sory is how do you think Philip and Timothy will get home? OR WILL THEY?????????!!!
4,Lost for 58 days on a mysterious island.,"Timothy and Phillip meet on a raft after being shipwrecked by a German submarine and lost on a forgotten island. This book tells the difficult journey to survive on a island for 58 days. Phillip is blind from a crack on the head and Timothy is over 70 years of age, oh yeah, and you can' t forget Stew Cat(Stew Cat used to belong to the chef on the torpedoded boat). The three of them try to survive on a mysterious cay in the center of a Devil' s Mouth."
5,woundress clanging cay or the tretrous cay,Well I think the cay was a great book it was exsiting till something boring happens but then exsiting again but I do like tose kind of storys.The story had a perfect beggining a sad but happy ending.the characters were perfect for there part.It was as good as my favorite book. I also feel like the story was real!Well that is what I think of the Cay.
4,Stranded,"I liked the book The Cay. It was interesting, though some parts were scary. I liked the character Timothy, because he was a good guy and to Phillip it did not matter what color Timothy's skin was, because Phillip was blind. Phillip ended up trusting Timothy with his life.We read the book in class, and most people liked it. To me it gave me a real look about what it was like in World War Two, when my grandfather was a pilot. It gave me a look on how hard it was for everyone, even if you were innocent. Phillip was only a boy but the War changed his life drastically, like so many others, because he was stranded."
3,A Strong Novel,"""THE CAY"" BY:THEODORE TAYLORPhillip is a young white boy from the U.S. that now lives in Curacao, a small island in Venezuaela. When he and his mother leave the island for the U.S. because of the war, their ship is bombed by the Germans. Phillip is knocked out and goes overboard. He is rescued by a big black man named Timothy. Phillip, a young racist boy, is helped when he goes blind and Timothy helps him through a hard time. His life is saved in a terrible hurricane by the man who he once was disguested by his skin color changes his life for ever. I thought the story moved slow and was not very exciting."
4,I like this book it is interresting.,"A totally absorbing story...starkly dramatic,believable and compelling I liked ""Timothy Of The Cay"" too."
2,Completely unrealistic and unbelievable.,"Not a worthwhile read. Don't waste your time. Interesting plot, but got a little carried away with the disasters and everything. Like a Disney movie."
2,This was an awful book.,"This book had horrible narration, a plot that would make a dog wretch, totally undeserving of a sequel. If books were firewood, this would be on the top of my pile, first to be thrown onto the pit. None of the characters were hardly likable, except maybe Stu, thecat. Don't read this book, ever."
2,"I like how Timothy talks, but I think it has no action.","This is a cool book, and I think it is really cool that Phillip can get around by himself(no I am not retarded)."
2,The Cay,The book is about aman named Timothy and a blind boy named Phillp.They go on a cruze but they had a little surprise they both landed on an island.How are they going to deal with each other?If they hate each other.I didn't really like this book because it didn't really have action.This book only talk about a boy that is blind and a man that does not like the boy at all.Thats why I really didn'tlike this book.I would recommend this book to a six-grader the reason is that I think they would like this book more than a seventh grader would.Why? because a seventh grader wants more action in their books
2,The Cay by Rachel,"In 1942 Philip Enright was living with his parents on the Caribbean island of Curacao. When the Germans attack the island, his mother decides to move back to her hometown in Virginia. When the ship taking them to their new home is torpedoed, Philip is hit on the head and finds himself on a raft with an old black man named Timothy and a cat. After a while Philip becomes blind. Philip doesn't know what to think of Timothy at first but after a while they but they soon realize that if they want to survive they have to get along. Will they survive? Will Philip ever see his family again? Read it and find out.I didn't like this book because it had to much action for my taste. But for a true action lover this book might prove as satisfactory."
1,i thought it was ok,"it was ok,but it was boring. i think it has a good lesson to learn. i thought the lesson was no matter what race you are you can get along."
2,IT WAS ALRIGHT,"TIMOTHY OF THE CAY WAS A GOOD BOOK, BUT A THE FIRST I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT LATER ON IN THE STORY I GOT TO LIKE IT. IT WAS SAD WHEN PHILOP DIED, THIOTHY HAD TO SURVIVE ON HIS SELF, FIX HIS ON FOOD. THEN WHEN HE GOT RESUEED HE HAD NO CLOTHES ON. THEN WHEN HE GOT SIGHT BACK HE, HE WHENT TO THE PLACE HE BERRED PHILOP AT."
5,great book!,"i am suprised how real this was-it pulled me in-i could not put it down and at the end i just said-""man-i wish this was not over""-i will forever be greatful to mr. taylor for supplying such a riviting book to my generation-THANK YOUps-get this book-you will NOT be dissapointed"
5,A story with life's lessons throughout!,"My sixth graders learn to love Timothy and appreciate his gentleness and concern for Phillip. They get into very deep discussions about relationships between different cultures, and I have seen compassion from students I never thought could empathize with others. Great book!! :)"
4,A study of prejudice in a story of human survival.,"After attacked by German submarines while on a ship travelling to the U.S.A., Phillip is left on a raft with Timothy, a West Indian man. While they drift off into the sea, Phillip becomes blind after getting hit in the head. Phillip has to rely on Timothy, but the only problem is that Phillip is prejudiced against black people. While they drift their freindship gets closer every day as they struggle for survival. They reach a tiny remote Cay and something terrible happens."
3,THe Cay,I like this book cause of the people in the book and how ithappened. The way he mad the boy go blind cause he did't like blackpeople touched me cause I am black! I wish they would of found the boy the author is very nice and the way he writes his books the type of people he uses. I would like to read his adult book the thrillers.
3,The Bomb,I think this book was good but for children. It teaches people the value of Human Life. I recomend this book to people who are begining readers.
4,I give The Cay a major thumbs up!!!,"This is a great book, and I would defenently recommend it to a friend. Although it was sad at the end. I thought Stew Cat would die too,but he survived. It takes blindness for Phillip to truly see. There is not enough time in the day to say everything I want to say about the book. It was wonderful. REVIEW BY:KRISTEN L.SANDERS"
5,THE CAY was a great book I rated this book with 5 stars,"I think this book was a great book.It had great background music on it.It's the best book I've ever read,but the sad part in it was when phillip went blind,and the best part was when he got saved.I thought his mother was going to die and that was what scared me the most in the story. I liked all of the characters in the story but I liked timothy the best because he had a wierd accent thats why I liked him.I rated this book with 5 stars because it was so good. REVIEWED BY ALICIA S."
4,The Cay,I liked The Cay and I did not like The Cay. I think Mom and Dad should have been in the book more than they were.The author should take a little part out; the war part and raft part. The author should put more about when Timothy and Phillip were on the raft and Phillip fell off the raft and Timothy went to resuce Phillip. I think six graders and parents should read The Cay.
3,LIFE OR DEATH SITUATIONS,"The Cay is a story about a young 12-year-old boy named Phillip who becomes marooned upon a desolate island with a black man named Timothy. I believe that the theme of the CayIs to keep your heart nearby when worst comes to worst.Together they learn to survive and become dependent on all of the life around them. With a war raging around them their hopes of rescue are slowly dissipating. Their attempts to be seen continue to go unnoticed by the pilots. With tragedy around every corner Phillip must learn how to live on his own. One question lingers in Phillip's mind-""will I ever be rescued?"" Theodore Taylor has a certain style of making his theme so irresistible that keeps his readers on the edge of their seats. This is a must read story for young adults and their parents."
4,Shipwrecked,"The Cay is about a boy, Phillip who only has one hope of surviving, a black man named Timothy. Phillip and Timothy were shipwrecked and Phillip hit his head and went blind. Phillip always looked down upon black people. He looked down upon black people because of his mother&#65533;s hatred of black people. This most shows when he quotes, &#65533;You stupid black man you can&#65533;t even spell&#65533;. Now he must overcome his racism in order to survive. All in all this is a good book, it has just enough foreshadowing to give you hints about what is going to happen next. Like when Timothy told Phillip not to go near the edge because he&#65533;ll fall overboard you know Phillip is going to fall overboard. That is good foreshadowing. I think this is a interesting book."
4,The Cay,"I enjoyed the cay, but feel that it is not the best book for children above the age of 10. Why? Simply because, for a 6th grader or above, there just isn't enough action and drama. While in the eyes of a fith, fourth or even a third grader this book is excellent! I also recommend Timothy of the Cay, for those who thouroghly loved The Cay. In conclusion,Theadore Taylor did a good job on The Cay."
4,Sienna's Review,"The Cay,is a very interesting book about a racist boy who is stranded on an island with a African American named,Timothy.Phillip learns his lesson not to judge because,when u are left with one person you don't like .You have to learn how to depend on each other.So if you like history,or moral,or humorous books u should like this one."
5,Great reading aid!,"This audio CD brings the book to life. Hard-to-pronounce names of places and dialect make the book a difficult read for my reading-challenged students, but they loved listening to the CD while they followed along in the book."
5,Good boy's book about race and respect,"This short novel for boys tells how a white American boy becomes marooned with an old West Indian black man on a tiny island during World War II. It's simple, direct, often exciting, truthful, and well-observed. Along with the story of this archetypal relationship (which is much like that between Huckleberry Finn and Jim) it tells a good deal about the fundamentals of life on a Caribbean reef island (the ""cay"") and about the direct experience of a hurricane. This is a solid, serious, engaging and accessible book that rightfully been in print since 1969. Take Me With You When You Go"
5,WOW! WHAT A BOOK! YOU MUST READ!,"I really enjoyed this book because it keeps you guessing what was going to happen next. The other reason why I really like this book is because it has alot of adventures. I liked the character Phillip Enright because he never gave up. The other reason I liked this character is he was very brave. The best part of the book was when Timothy(A fearsome west Indian native) and Phillip begin living their life on the cay. When they begin their life on the cay, is where their adventure begins. Phillip becomes blind and Timothy must show him how to survive without him on the cay. At the end of this book, Timothy becomes ill and could die at any time. Phillip is now left alone to find his way off the cay. Does Phillip ever get his eyesight back?? Does he ever get off the cay?? Does he ever see his parents again? That is a mystery till you read this wonderful book, The Cay, By Theodore Taylor."
4,The Cay,"I thought the book was pretty good. It had a great plot and a fascinating setting. It was written so well, it seemed so realistic."
3,well its O.K...........From a 5th grade girl,"This is a book that takes place in the devils mouth, where Timothy and a 12 year old named Phillip, were stranded.The Island is one of a series of cay's located in the Carribean. Phillip has been blinded and is predjudice against Timothy who is black but his only way to survive. Slowly Timothy shows Phillip that it dosen't matter what color we are because we all have something to give to the world. Soon Phillip learns that even though he is blind he can still ""see"" and be self-sufficient ."
4,Read the Cay!,"This book is about a young boy named Phillip who has to learn alot about survival and being independent. I would recommend this book to everyone because no matter how old you are it still leaves you with a certain meaning about life. So hurry up and read it, you'll like it!"
4,The cay,This book was interesting...It was kind of hard to follow along because the kid was blind...but over all this book was a good book. I would recogmend this book to people.
3,The Cay,At first I thought that this book was going to be boring and i guess it is true when people say don't judge a book by its cover overall it was an o.k. book I would recommend it but please keep in mind this book is not for everyone not because of violence but because some people might find it boring i have to admit it was kind of boring but once again overall it was an o.k. book.
5,READ THE CAY!!,THE CAY iS AN AWESOME BOOK!! iTS A TiGHTLY COMPRESSED STORY OF ENDURANCE AND REAVALTiON...iT HAS AN OUTRAGEOUS SETTING THAT iS FULLY REALiZED AT THE END! AND i WOULD DEFiNiTLY RECOMEND PEOPLE TO READ PURCHASE THiS BOOK!!!! =]
4,A Great Book.,"There is not much to say about ""The Cay"" except it really took blindness to make Philip see. But it would have been interesting for Philip to still be blind so the author could write a sequal. The author should have not let Timothy die because it would have been neat to have Timothy meet Philip's parents. Other then that, it is a great book. I definently recommend to people to read.Reviewed By Cody H."
4,The Cay,"The book ""The Cay"" took place in 1942 during World War II in the Caribbean Sea. It's about a young boy named Phillip, who gets stranded on a small cay/island in the Devil's Mouth along with an old, ugly, black man named Timothy. The main idea of the story is about their survival on the cay for several months through hurricanes and the raging sea. ""The Cay"" is a good book, but it sometimes it lost our interest."
2,I didn't like it,"Timothy was not a real black man to me. No real black man would take that kind of disrespect from a child. I didn't like the fact that the characters were seen as equals when the older man was wiser and stronger than the boy. I kept wanting Timothy to put Phillp in his place. And why is it that Timothy had to die in order for Phillp to respect him. Timothy seemed like an Uncle Tom to me. It was well written with great detail, but Tim, shouldn't have let that little boy treat him like a punk. I guess for those people who aren't convinced that blacks and whites are equal they should read this book . But as for me, I already knew that."
5,the story of living with a black man for a little while,The story is about a boy named Phillip.His mom is a house mom and his father works at a refinery.World War II is going on. They live in Williamsted an they it is going on in Curaco.Now he and his mother leave on the U.S Hato to go back to the United States. Their ship has been torpedoed.He is now in a life boat he gets flipped out by getting hit in the head by something on the ship.Phillip is now in a raft with a big black man. They are on an island and now they are just getting to know each other.I hope that you read this book. I thought this book was one of the best books i have ever read.
3,stranded on an island,"This is about a boy named Phillip who is stranded on an island with this man named Timothy. They were stranded on the island for a long time and on this island Phillip is blind and Timothy must help him find his way around, until Timothy decides to make a rope and when Timothy ask Phillip to help with the work but Phillip didn't want to help so Timothy slaped him in the face and then Phillip relize the stuff was really for him. I really don't want to give away to much info."
3,facinating book,I think The Cay is a fascinating book because it is adventuress book about survival. Timothy and Phillip (the two main characters) go through a lot in this story such as being stranded on the cay. I think Phillip learns a lot about friendship and survival. It is a good book for someone who likes adventure and non-fiction books. I give this book 3 out of 5 stars because I thought it had a good story line. I also recommend this book for someone in 5th to 7th grade because it would be challenging for an elementary student unless they were able to really understand hard books.
4,This book is awesome!,This book was pretty good i thought it had a fun setting and some interesting points.It showed to keep your head high even when times get hard.
4,"Ah, One of Those Good Books","This was a great book I really liked it! I really liked some of the parts on the island. Sometimes when Timothy left Phillip by himself on the island at first. Like when Timothy left and carved a fake cat so that Phillip would think Timothy killed the cat, or another time when Timothy left to gather wood to build the hut. I liked the way the Author told you why Phillip really became blind, not just the way Timothy thought it happened. The only thing that makes this four book instead of a five is that it had one of those perfect endings. I still do not get how him and his mother got on different boats though I wish the author explained it better. Over all this was a very good book I would read it again."
4,Confusing,The book takes place on a tiny cay during World War II. A 12 year old boy named Phillip gets stranded on an island with a strange man. Well that's what Phillip thinks. While Phillip is on the cay he learns about friendship and survival. If you can follow really confusing books thumbs up because you will need that skill. I think it is confusing because there is so much going on. I for one did not enjoy the experience of reading this book. But it's your choice so read it if you really want to but I just wanted to warn you.So good luck.P.S I'm a fourth grader That's why it was confusing for me
4,it's a book I'll remember,"The Cay ****At age 12 Phillip lives on the small island of Curacao. In the middle of the night the small island is attacked by German submarines. This disturbs Phillips mother so she decides that they should leave for Virginia. On the way there they get shipped wrecked! He got hit on the head by a falling lifeboat The blow knocked him out by it. When he wakes up he's in a small lifeboat with a terrible headache the first thing he noticed is he is no longer with his mother instead he is with about a 7 foot neogro. At first Phillip is very surprised at this and thinks he lives different and he is different. After many days of float out at open sea they find a small cay. Huge challenges face Phillip and Timothy. Will they survive? Will Phillip ever see his mother again?I thought this book was really stuck to me because Theodore Taylor wrote this with such compassion, you can't not like it. (That just my opinion.) I think it's a good twist between racism and survival"
4,REVEIW FOR THE CAY,"THIS BOOK IS A VERY GOOD BOOK. IT TELLS HOW PEOPLE CAN SURVIVE LIVING ON AN ISLANDS, I THINK. I HAVE ONLY READ THREE CHAPTERS SO THIS ISN`T VERY GOOD BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE IT WITH YOU."
5,A GREAT BOOK!!,This is a great story of survival. It's about how a boy has to survive without his eyes because he was blinded by a blow to the head but with the help of an old Jamacan named Timothy and Stew Cat he just might be able to survive...
4,The Cay,This book was fun to read if you enjoy stories about survival. Although i had to read it for school I am glad i did since it was very touching to me.
3,Im a 5th grade girl and I didn't like this book.,"I didn't like this book because the writer could have put more detail into the Cay and they ended it too smoothly. They could of put that they were found but Timothy never recovered from his blindness. ALSO THE PART I LIKED WAS HOW TIMOTHY TREATED PHILLIP WITH RESPECT EVEN THOUGH PHILLIP DIDN'T TREAT TIMOTHY WITH RESPECT BECAUSE TIMOTHY WAS BLACK BUT LATER IN THE BOOK THEY BECAME FRIENDS. THE PART I DIDN'T LIKE WAS THAT TIMOTHY DIED FOR PHILLIP. THEY BOTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED TOO. The end of the book wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I mostly liked how Timothy talked he used, ""Dat be true, Phillip"" a lot. I gave this book a 5 because it could have been better than the aurthor wrote it. The part I enjoyed was that Phillip thought that Timothy killed Stew Cat. When Phillip sees his mom and dad he doesn't seem too excited to see them."
2,"""The Cay"",OK?","I had to read this book for am english calss, and it was ok. I didnt really enjoy the book but thats just me. I maen, this book isnt really my favorite type of book, I like lord of the rings type things. the story was great and the message was good too but I just dont like the way it was written, the narrative. but all in all it was not a bad book and it was not a book that I would like to hear about again. I read it, thats it. :-P"
3,The Cay Review by Katie S.,"An 11-year-old boy named Phillip Wright gets lost on a Caribbean island with an old, black man named Timothy. At first, Phillip was prejudice. Then he started liking black people because he had formed a friendship with Timothy. I recommend this book to ages nine or older because younger kids might get bored. I think it is an adventure that's exciting and excellent. I don't want to say too much or I will spoil the story, so you will just have to read it yourself."
1,My review,"The CayBy, ChelseaThe Cay, by Theodore Taylor.The Cay is a tragic story about a boy named Phillip who lost his mother at sea and lost his eye sight from a bad hit on the head .He then floated to a deserted island with a black man named Timothy and a cat named Stew cat. The difficult conditions on the island left them fighting for their lives. In this book you will figure out that people are all the same on the inside no matter how they look on the outside. This whole book is all about friendship.I must say this book began in an exiting way but then it got to easy to guess what would happen next. That just made it too boring for me. But, if this book sounds good to you, go on and read it. I hope you like it better then I did."
2,The Cay review by Brian,"This is a book about a boy name Philip. Philip was a boy that was racist to black people at first because of is Mother. Philip lived-in a place called Caribbean. And there was War 2 going on. I think that Philip does not like black people, but at the end of the book he dose like black people. Philip is like me because I was blind in my eyes like Philip. They were striped on an island for a long time. I did not think it was excited. It was really boring in the begging but at the end it was a little excited. I gave this book a 0 OUT OF A 100"
2,The Review of the cay,This book didnt excite me that much but i did enjoy some parts. This book is about a boy named Phillip and a black man named Timothy that get stranded on a island that has never been on a map. They have some truouble finding food. Timothy is old and cant talk proper english. Timothy is the one that has to get all the food.Phillip is blind because he stared at the sun for a very long time. There is many troubles while timothy and Phillip are on the cay alone. There is a hurricane that happens and they both fell asleep during the hurricane and when phillip woke up he tugged on Timothy and he wasnt moving. He was dead from the hurricane. Luckily Phillip survives and gets rescued and reunighted with his family.
2,The Cay,"This book takes place during WW II. A boy named Phillip was stranded with a black man, named Timothy, and a cat. Then the boy became blind and Timothy dies of old age, so the boy has to rely on his other instincts to survive on the island until some help comes. Philip finds out that he can see if he wears glasses. I liked the book because it tacks place in a war. Try to get your hands on it. I will give it 2 stars.Joel Severson"
4,It was one of the best books I have ever read.,"The Cay was a great book about a boy named Phillip who gets hit in the head, shipwrecked,and goes blind. He then depends on a black man named Timothy. His mom was prejudice so that is the way Phillip felt until he got to know Timothy. When Timothy dies he has to figure out how to take care of himself. The Cay is a book that tries to teach you that the color of people's skin doesn't count."
3,Totally Cool Book,This book has to do with a boy and a man who are stuck on an Island. They go through trials and tribulations while on the Island. If you like action you will like this book.
3,I think that thes book is great,Eagle kite.By Paula Fox was about a ten year old boy named Liam. Laim smashed and buried his Eagle Kite that his father had givenhim. It was the day that he saw his father on the beach with someone else. Liam has kept that memory for three years. Now liam's mother knows that his is sick from a blood transfusion . Liam knows the truth about what had happend to his father. He also knows how his father has betrayed them ever since.Liam and his mother know that their is nothing they can do and his father is soon to die
2,Teachers beware,"I read this book for an education class that I had. If I had children, I would prefer they not read this book. It is a mature subject, that unfortunately some children face, but I wouldn't reccomend it to any young person."
3,Meh.,"I just remember listening to this album for the first time and realizing that it was good and that the musicians were talented, but unable to get excited by the songs.Maybe the band's other albums are better but I haven't felt compelled to buy them. You know how sometimes you can recognize a band just by a few beats of one of their songs? I'm never able to do that with this CD-I always have to check and see who it is. Don't love it, don't hate it, it's just there."
5,Better than the newer edition,This book is much more concise than the new edition and is perfect review for USMLE.
3,NOT WORTH IT,"This book is ok if you are struggling in this area, but it really isn't necessary. It isn't even a highly tested subject. DONT buy it here for $50 or more. It is not worth it. If you think you need it, try first getting it from another student. I sent an email to my school's listserve and somebody sold it to me for $25. Give it a try...."
2,Definitely not worth the hype,"I bought this book to study for the USMLE Step 1 exam because of recommendations that I read on [...]. The book is currently out of print, and many people will try to buy this book for exorbitantly high prices in some cases. It is not worth any more than cover price in my opinion. I admittedly have a solid background in Genetics from undergrad and research but I probably have the same background in Molecular Biology as every other US med student and I don't think I really learned anything from this book that I didn't already know, or at least anything I wouldn't have learned from UWorld and First Aid. If you struggle with these subjects, this book presents the concepts very clearly and concisely, but if you are not particularly weak in this area, I don't think this book is worth the extra money that it sometimes costs."
1,NOT SO GOOD,The colors in the photo have nothing to see with the real product. IVORY?? IT'S ALMOST YELLOW!!
5,A Must Read...,"This wonderful book, the second in a series about Hannah Trevor a midwife in Colonial America, is a must read for all lovers of history and/or mystery. Margaret Lawrence is a talented author who has obviously done a great deal of research about Colonial America and it's inhabitants. After reading this book and Blood Read Roses, I became very grateful to be a woman of the 20th century!"
5,Rich in history,"This book was rich in history and suspense. I loved it! Anybody who loves reading about history will truly enjoy this book. The time after the Revoluntionary War was a troubling time, and a time that most people don't know much about. If you are a history buff, this is a MUST READ."
1,Hard to read,"I was totally depressed while reading this book. I know women had few rights and were treated badly during this time period. However, I believe Hannah could have done better for herself and her daughter if she had been less stubborn. The book lacked a smoothness and continuity that would have made it easier to read. I think what some readers regarded as suspense was a lack of character development. I couldn't guess who the murderer was because the book jumped around so much and I knew so little about the characters."
2,Hearts and Bones remake,"Lacks originality - take ""Hearts and Bones"" throw in some new character names, add another ""mentally unstable"" chracter and presto - you have this book."
1,Didn't repel the rabbit,"Followed the directions. Applied liberally. Dries over several hours. Bunny rabbit standing in the middle of my garden chewing on lily shoots.Doesn't work. Further, the odor does linger after fully dried, although far less.Asking for the manufacturer's money back guarantee and buying a cage trap."
4,Deer repellent..... works!!,"Bought this product after deer leveled my two rose gardens...... I was heartbroken. Have been using it now for approximately 1 month with great success. I do spray every week, sometimes twice if there has been a lot of rain. My roses are coming back and starting to look good again! Yes it does stink terribly when you first spray it on, but once it dries, it is not that bad at all, can hardly smell it. Supposedly though, it is still very perceptable by the deer. So far so good. I am happy with the results. I live in a very wooded area of NC, my lot is surrounded by woods on 3 of 4 sides. So if this keeps working, I will keep buying. Rated 4 stars as you do need to spray more than once a month. As said, I am doing at least once a week."
2,Hold Your Nose!!!,"This stuff smells SO bad, I can understand why it would ward off deer. When I got my package and opened it I almost threw up (some of it had leaked out). I had to store this in the garage because the smell was so pungent. I wish I hadn't ordered so much! I'm not even sure I can sit outside after this has been sprayed on my plants. I will go back to using Deer Off when I run out of this stuff. That stuff was pretty effective and didn't literally make me vomit. I have just started using and can't really speak to it's effectiveness - hopefully it works and will be worth the nausea."
5,liquid Fence,I love this product. I've used it for several years. We have a virtual stampede of cottontail rabbits about the time my tulips emerge. The rabbits keep them slicked off to the ground if I don't use Liquid Fence. With this product they don't bother them at all. I also use it on my roses to keep the rabbits from chewing the bark off. It does stink though. That's why I buy the ready to use so I don't have to mix the smelly stuff.
2,stinky repellent,"The product stinks. It smells like a sewer backed up. It lasts for a while then it disappears. I put it on my roses, liliacs, hydranges, rhodo's, azeleas, and peones.I live in a woodsy area. It does seem to repeal deer and other small animals. I also think it repels dogs, cats and humans.I would never buy this product again."
1,Waste of money --- repels humans instead of rabbits,"Within 30 minutes of heavily spraying Liquid Fence around the base of my perimeter fence, I watched a rabbit burrow under the fence into my yard, totally oblivious that he was supposed to be repulsed by the ""repellent"". Unfortunately for me, however, the vile, vomit-like stench that this product produces lingered for days, repelling my family from the area. They cursed my name. The rabbits continued to pour into my yard, even laying babies in my strawberry garden. This should be labeled ""human repellent"" or ""how to lose your family in 30 minutes"", anything but ""rabbit repellent""."
1,Liquid Deer Fence does not work!,I followed all instructions on the spray bottle. It said on the bottle that you only need to spray once a week for 3 weeks but I sprayed every day to insure that it would keep the deer off my flowers. After 3 days the deer came in and ate EVERY flower down to a nub! I know the stuff was on the flowers because it turns a white color when it dries. It never rained in those 3 days either. So my conclusion is that the deer could care less the product smells bad and I would say that it must not have tasted bad seeing they ate the flowers down to the dirt!
3,The Jury's Still Out,"Have small dessert back yard being decimated by rabbits. Sprayed their favorite plants. Still not sure how effective. Started with quart size, purchases gallon. We're still not sure how effective. While there have been negative reviews because of it's strong smell. In this dry climate the oder doesn't last long. Once dry the smell vanishes, except for the rabbits, we hope."
1,Buyer beware,This is not a DVD of sketches! You think you're getting a collection of sketches from the 80's? Guess again! It's a SNL over the years talking about who was in the cast and how it changed over the years.
1,Not quiet what I expected. Wanted full sketches,I've been a fan of SNL since it started in the 1970's. And most of the dvd's that came out over the past few years were very well done and I frequently watch them and when I'm not having a good day they gives me some well needed laughs. That being said this dvd isn't what I had expected. I was hoping for sketches from this time instead it was interviews. I'm not saying they shouldn't have interviews but I would rather see entire sketches and if there were interviews they would be on the extras section. If you want interviews I guess this would be right down your alley. I just wanted full sketches.
3,Hit&Miss,"Confessions part 2 is cool I like the vibe of that cut. Mt Boo does nothing for me except for the part where Him&Alicia say I don't know about you but I know about us. that is the Only part I like about that Cut.Usher is more like a Bobby Brown Lite than anything close to Michael Jackson.Usher can't Hold MJ's Glitter Glove,Usher is a aight vocalist&Just a cat that has worked hard.truth be told he is to me closer to what Janet jackson did in that being a Hard working Artist that just kept at it as to being a truly Great or even Good artist."
2,What toys?,"While this book does a great job at organizing both content and activities, it uses few toys. I wanted science activities using common toys since it seems easily done. What this book uses are common household items, and some items you would definitely have to look for. Syringes, pop bottles, plastic aquarium, plastic cups, borax, elmer's glue, sugar, magnifyings lens, sandpaper, laundry bluing, ammonia, ice cream, freezer pops, balloons (finally a ""toy""!), thermometer, hot plate, bunsen burner, ring stand, wire gauze, polyvinyl alcohol, Bedbug game (a toy, not common), Magic Tree kit, air freshner, balance, goggles, perfume, nail polish remover, cologne, pre-shave lotion, after-shave lotion, dry ice, styrofoam container, flask...I was disappointed. You can find plenty of activities, online, similar to these, I wanted to use the toys I have around here to demonstrate and explore science."
5,An Old Favorite!,"I actually have the original edition of this book in all it's yellowed glory. My parents gave me heaps of my childhood books after my son was born and this has become one of his favorites. I am thrilled to find it in a new edition so that the old one can be left to rest before it completely falls apart.The text of this book is so well done for beginning readers, with lots of word repetition. Also, I think the signage helps children to recognize words by their shape before they are able to actually read. My 3 year old can read the ""stop"", ""go"", ""fast"" and ""slow"" signs along with a few others just because he recognizes thier shapes and colors.I'm excited to see what other beloved books of my childhood will make a comeback. This is a delight!"
3,Its gets better with time,"Of all the stories we hear/read as a kid, some we remember more than others. When I was a kid, I didn't understand why this book would remain so vividly in my memory for more than 30 years, but now I know.The rhythm of the book is upbeat and enjoyable. While the graphics lack lustre, looking deeply in them reveals a whole layer of humor that is best understand as an adult. For example, The mixed up sign over the mayor's office said this way to the zoo, and the mixed up sign over the bank read bread.I use this book to read to my 8th grade students to promote critical thinking and deeper understanding. I read it to my 4 year old daughter for the light and entertaining story. I'm glad the story is still around for the next generation to benefit from."
3,Some new ideas for westernized look,"I guess with something so long, there is only so much you can do with this. If obi is to be folded to show salient theme, needs to show how to fold it"
5,Design with Japanese Obi,Prompt and efficent delivery as stated.Book in great condition as described andvery satisfied with the book and service.
2,vehicle charger does not fit,"I have 2005 Honda Accord. For some reason, the lighter adapter does not work in my car. You may have better luck with other vehicles."
2,3 pieces of mess,The ear piece does not work properly. Can barely hear anything. It has now broke on me. The leather case does not fit the phone perfectly. The bottom is too big for the phone.
3,Product with wrong design,earbud broke on 3rd day. Case is not matching with Cell phone design. Cigarette lighter adapter is only useful.
5,Charlie and Lita,"I came across this book in a used bookstore, and not knowing much about Mr. Chaplin or his wives decided to grab it. So glad I did. I love this book. It's amazingly well written, with an amazing recall from the author. I would say I can't believe she put up with everything that she did from him, but then again, she was VERY young. I'm not sure if this book is 'mostly embellished' like I've recently seen in reviews of her other book, but I found it highly enjoyable. She got me into wanting to read everything about the silent era."
5,Quintessential Hard Bop,"This album has it all: tight arrangements of standards, fresh new tunes, and fantastic solos by all. Features Art Farmer, Benny Golson, Curtis Fuller, McCoy Tyner (only 24 years old, not yet into his cuartal harmonies and shimmering pentatonics), Addison Farmer, and Lex Humphries.The dialogues between McCoy and Lex are fantastic as are all of Curtis Fuller's solos, which seem to all be at smokin' tempos. There is also a hip spoken intro to Killer Joe. Horns don't just sit around either. They back up the soloist or melody.In short, this is a fine disc. Dig it."
2,for those that like the genre,"This was a made-for-TV film, but it wasn't below the quality of what one can see in a theater. It had no severe breaks where commercials would fit. If you like political intrigue works like Baldwin's ""Crimson Tide,"" Stone's ""JFK,"" or Crowe's ""The Insider,"" then this will be for you. For us Americans who were delighting in 1990s, Internet-based prosperity, this will remind us that not everyone in the world was succeeding. The main character in this work is a woman, yet the cover implies that she is just one of many main characters. This may be sexist, an attempt to appease the mostly male audience that expects men to be leaders in international turmoils. One character was supposed to work for the UK, lived their most of his life, but had an American accent just like any other American at home. Again, this work is just for those who like this type of film."
3,Used for School,I was looking for a video that I could use in school related to genocide that was not rated R. This movie takes the story of why it didn't seem like anything happened to the leaders of this genocide and shows exactly what the barriers involved were.
3,CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY,"HUNT FOR JUSTICE is to be applauded for its intent to show the horrible war crimes committed during the Bosnian war. Justice Louise Arbour is certainly a person to admire as she did her best to bring Milosevic and other heinous officials to their just dessert. Wendy Crewson is fine in the lead role, her sensitivity and commitment evident; John Corbett is also very good as a British soldier who befriends her and helps her. William Hurt has a cameo as one of the generals opposing Arbour's efforts fearful of igniting more wars. More a history lesson than an entertaining movie, HUNT FOR JUSTICE is still viable entertainment."
5,Novel follows 1981 film well.,"This book is an entertaining read. It follows the film to the exact. Oddly, the cover of the book features the movie poster art of the 1980 orginal film rather than the poster for Part 2. Anyway, a good book to collect if you can get your hands on it since it was the best of all the sequels."
1,USED??,"Disgusted. The delivery looked very worn but we didn't think the damage was going to be more than superfacial so we gave it to our daughter. The unit inside was damaged... scratched sides, bent drawer guides and missing half the directions. It looked USED! Never again."
5,A few more of the stars on this DVD,"A few more of the stars on this amazing DVD. Roy Eldridge, Joe Newman, Joe Wilder, Doc Cheatham, Emmett Berry, Benny Morton, Nat Pearce, Milt Hinton,Jim Hall and last but not least the GREAT Rex Stewart."
3,Does not fit newer nano models,"There is nothing wrong with the product, only the description. The Amazon description and product packaging say it fits all nano models, but it didn't fit my new nano. Seller informs me it fits only first and second generation iPod nanos. It would be a great little device (for car trips, etc.) for those models."
2,"For this cd, Danny tried too many things","This is one more cd for me to add to my Danny W. collection. For this cd, I think Danny tried to provide too many different sounds. Here he offfers several solo piano arrangements and several arrangements with different combinations of piano and other instruments. I feel like Danny tried too hard, but came up a little short.The song selection for this cd was about average. He used a lot of high profile songs with a few unknown tunes sprinkled in. I feel like this cd could have offered a few better songs. There are tons and tons of huge Christmas hits to choose from, why not try to select the best songs available.I think this cd will please some people!"
1,Inadequate,"While this book would make a good user's manual, the simplistic multiple-choice questions and lack of practical, hands-on excercises fail to give the novice a clue as to what the CNA Test is really like. The book says that a network to practice on is ""helpful."" It is not ""helpful"", it is NECESSARY!!!"
2,"Good for understanding Novell, but for passing the CNA exam?","I bought this book because the reviews I read here online seemed to say this was a good book to study from. Well, in some ways it was, but when I took the CNA exam, I found that most of the questions were a bit different from those I had been preparing for. It may be that the book gave me such a good basic grounding that I passed, but I guess I was disappointed in how unhelpful this book turned out to be."
4,A good buy...,"...money wise, in any case. They're much cheaper than in any stores in our area. The only drawback is cleaning them off and breaking off the stems. It might take a while. Otherwise, no complaints. They're delicious after soaking them for about 20 minutes in cold water. I love them in gravies and over potatoes and pasta."
3,Poor Delivery Method~,"Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood. I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps. The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money. The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review. 'Nuff said...."
4,Much better than Expected,"I was able to rent this movie through Netflix, and was pleased to watch a much better than average movie for LDS audiences. Although some parts of the script pushed credibility a little, the movie provides a very insightful character study into a father who lost his wife and finds himself thinking he is about to lose his daughter. The issues of getting over past problems and moving forward apply to many of us, and were well represented in this movie with a mostly good script and very good acting for a low budget LDS movie."
5,Excellent Movie!,"It made me laugh - it made me cry. It even made me think a bit. Thank you to Kirby Heyborne and Curt Doussett for their wonderful performances and to Michael Flynn for excellent directing and script writing. The scenery in and around Midway, UT is incredible - it is a beautiful area."
3,Side Project,"Alfie was a side project of instrumentals that Stevie Wonder released under the name of Eivets Rednow which is his name spelled backwards. This is one of those albums that is more for the artists themselves than the public but it does contain some excellent harmonica work from Mr. Wonder. The title track, ""Grazing In The Grass"" and ""Never My Love/Ask The Lonely"" are good listens. Alfie is a decent listen but this is one is basically for completists."
3,GREAT HARMONICA PLAYING,"The problem with music is the background, it isdated and a bit overpowering."
3,"Okay,I Know!",I can explain this entire album in a heartbeat-this isrecorded under Stevie Wonder's name spelled backwards andconsists of a series of instrumentals featuring Wonder's superbharmonica playing over easy-listening 1960's lounge/bachelor padmusic!So an A+ grade for Stevie and a big HA!HA!HA!HA! for the music.If only Stevie couldv'e known what the future of loungewould be-his career might've taken a very different path.Thank goodness it didn't go THIS way!
4,It is still magic,"If you are a fan of Stevie Wonder you will appreciate this C.D. He and Eivets Redrow make a great,energetic team. Even though Stevie is not adding to the song with his wonderful, clever lyrics, you can still fell what the moods of a given song are supposed to be just by listening to the music."
2,Well illustrated,"For people who have never had the opportunity to train with any of the gear, this is a good reference. It's kinda interesting which items he has determined are quote-unquote counter-terrorist equipment. He has kind of lapped the fields of EOD/PSBT, Quick-Reaction/SWAT, and I don't know what together.Still, if you were a writer, and needed a reference for gear for your hero replete with pictures, this book is for you!"
5,fun and informative guide,"Having just returned from the Netherlands, we found this book to be very helpful and also an icebreaker with new Dutch friends, who thought some of the observations about their national character and customs were spot-on while others were amusing. Also, citizens were surprised that I knew a fair bit of history as well as more contemporary information about national politics etc. This was a handy guide to the basics of functioning in this wonderful country. I would recommend this to travellers. Very handy."
4,Great Present,"I gave this to my younger sister (3) for Christmas last year, and she loved it. She didn't pay much attention to the different shapes or colors, but she loved the paints and the stamps."
1,must try harder,"this man is clearly insane. after three years of his teaching, he is obvoiusly obsessive and has a dirty mind"
5,A fan from Odenton,"Who knew that ""viatical"" insurance policies could serve up so much mystery entertainment value? Perhaps in lesser hands it wouldn't, but Marcia Talley and her protaganist - Hannah Ives - are in fine form as they investigate how an insurance policy that pays dividends to others may have hastened the death of her good friend. Those of you with the Hannah Ives series will know that Hannah is a breat cancer survivor. As if life weren't hard enough, those kind of challenges can create difficulties making ends meet. A viatical seemed like the perfect choice for her Hannah's friend, but greed may have shortened her friend's life more than the cancer. A thought-provoking great read!"
4,They came to dig a ditch.,"South of Heaven is not one of Jim Thompson's top tier novels but it's worthwhile reading nonetheless. The narrative unfolds in the West Texas of the 1920s and describes the brutal conditions under which miles of natural gas pipeline were laid by homeless, rootless men desperate for work. One of these men was 21 year old Tommy Burwell who provides the narration albeit from the safe and perhaps truth distorting vantage point of four decades after the fact. Through Burwell, Thompson skillfully describes a time and place where life is shockingly cheap and justice is a very rare commodity.Against all odds, Tommy finds love and goes on to have a number of harrowing adventures, many of which fall into the tall tale category.Contributing to South of Heaven's overall appeal is the authentic sounding dialogue and the poignant depictions of individuals who must continually struggle for their daily bread.Not one of Thompson's best but interesting enough to merit a 4 star rating."
4,It's okay.,"I like this book overall. The illustrations are pretty. It's a good tool to teach children about different types of flowers and different types of bugs. My main complaint is that it is too short. I might not mind that if I had bought a board book for a couple of bucks. For a hard-back book that costs as much as this one does, I'd prefer a little more for my money."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It is a DVD about a few vehicles that drive down a fairly smooth but rocky road in California, and talk the entire way about some guy that struck gold years ago. The Camera footage is Helmet Cam quality. The narrator is very boring. The DVD put me to sleep...Literally. I am disappointed that Amazon would carry such garbage in their inventory. Amazon...Please remove from your inventory to avoid future dissapointed customers."
2,"There were some bright spots for this cd, stay tuned...","For this cd Danny tried to play too many medleys. He used this vehicle three times. I have never been a big fan of medleys, but I try to tolerate this venue as much as possible. This time I thought these medelys were a little ridiculious.There were some bright spots for this cd. On the songs that I liked, Danny did a great job. He seemed to play with a lot of passion. He made these performances seem believeable.I think it would be alright to buy this cd."
3,I bought it as a gift so i can't rate this item,"I bought this cd for a gift so I'm unable to rate it, I've had to give it 3 stars or else I can't get to the next screen. However I can say it's not my kind of music, I myself prefer the Comsat Angels, check them out."
2,Poodle Blouse,"Poor Quality. Poodle did not look like a poodle, fabric very poor quality cotton and was styled as a bowling shirt. No problem with return and money was promptly refunded."
1,Poodle blouse-- really dissapointed,"I was really dissapointed with this purchase. There is no conversion table for measurements so I ordered a 2X and the shirt came in the size of a blanket-- so order small. The shipping was really expensive and I ended up having to get a refund because it costs over $20 in shipping to get a exchange since you (the customer) has to pay for all shipping. I was not happy because I ended up spending $14 on shipping for nothing--- by the time the company got the shirt back and called me for my credit card number for more shipping to send a smaller size, I was already tired of dealing with the high shipping. It is better to order the individual poodle patches from their site and hot glue them to a black shirt-- it is not worth the $40 buying the shirt online if you have to anticipate your size because there is not clear measurement table online."
1,non0oem battteries for Gateway laptops,"The service from the vendor was excellent. Unfortunately, the 2 batteries they shipped me did not charge when plugged into my Gatelway laptop. When I bought the same battery from Gateway it worked immediately."
2,Please do not buy this book,"This is a shockingly disingenious feel-good product designed to sell people on the concept of network or multi-level marketing. Mr. Pilzer (his doctorate is honorary, not an earned Ph.D. in economics or business) is selling books to an audience he knows wants to be told that they are doing something wise, justified, and rooted in scripture.The book is a favorite of Amway (Quickstar) sales people/ recruiters. Mr. Pilzer feeds their false belief that they are in business for themselves and that they will become wealthy by applying the ""system"". If you are buying this book at the behest of a direct marketer I encourage you to research the many fine sites on the web detailing the actual average earnings, cost, and sucess/ failure rates of such endeavors. You will learn nothing of value from this book and you might encourage someone to ""prospect"" you by reading it.Run the other way. Fast!"
4,Million dollar home business,"The Next Millionaires written by Professor Paul Zane Pilzer keeps you focused on your home based business.Any entrepreneur that wants to capitalize using the internet to sell their product, service will gain a good foundation on what to sell and understanding direct selling through todays technology.Pilzner discusses direct selling as a massive economic opportunity for a home based business that can achieve great success using technology available today. If you want to run a small direct selling business from your home this book is a must read.This book is easy to understand and provides a starting point for a home based business entrepreneur."
1,Rippoff,This is an interview with the author and not the book. It lasts 30mins. Don't waste your money.
1,CD not worth the time,"While I would guess the book goes into quite a bit of detail concerning direct marketing and internet sales, this audio CD is only a 30 minute interview with the author. He highlights (very roughly) the main points but gives NO details. The book was highly recommended to me and since I have a long commute each day, I bought this CD thinking I was getting an audio version of the book - boy was I wrong! Save your money on this CD and buy the book instead."
2,leaking mushy mess,"The price was right, unfortunately, the gel caps busted open and made a mushy mess."
2,Too expensive!,I'd read a lot about vitamin C been really good for your facial skin and bought these two products in hopes that it would make a difference. I didn't see a difference. I waited to use both bottles up before I wrote this review. They cost a lot of money. I don't recommend them.
4,"Informative, good introduction, but not perfect","This book can be used as an encyclopedia, but it is so interesting I just read the entire thing front to back. It looks good and as far as I know it is considered a reliable source of UFO-related information. The only problem I have with it is typing/writing errors. Would it have hurt to have someone check for mistakes?! I opened the book at a random page and immediately spotted one. That is the only reason for not giving it five stars. The book is still good, but not perfect."
4,"Great Resource, but Missing Significant Contributors to UFOlogy","Why some important people in UFOlogy were not mentioned in this book, I have no clue. People such as Joe Montaldo of International Community for Alien Research (www.ICAR1.com), James Gilliland of Enlightened Contact with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (www.ECETI.org) , Bill McDonald of www.AlienUFOart.com, to name a few. Or, how about Howard Menger, for crying out loud? Or, Long John Nebel? Or, August C. Roberts? Oh my god, what about Valiant Thor? These omissions disappoint me, but not having gone through the entire book yet, I still may state that it is filled with information that is most definitely worthy of my reading."
1,ugh,This thing reads more like a Coast-To-Coast-AM who's who than it does a serious book about UFOs.
2,Keep looking...,"Maybe it's just me, but the photographer/author of this book has a very short playbook for his shots. They are all incredibly over-posed, even down to the same blue/white clothes that nearly all his models wear. I felt like every page had the same information as the last. Most of the example shots were the kind grandma would like - nothing young couples and families would be asking for. All too dated for the modern photographer.Some of the lighting techniques are useful and interesting, but when you are shooting outdoors, God-given light is pretty easy and straight-forward to work with. With a little practice, anyone with a good eye can master outdoor lighting for portraits.Skip this book and save your $$ for a better lens. You'll be happier with better glass than having this book gathering dust on the shelf."
2,Not very useful. Portrait style is dated. Digital is not mentioned.,"Time goes fast and before you even realize information, tips, secrets regarding graphic arts -including photography- can be obsolete. This book is good if read back in the '80s. The style for protraits is out of current trends (meaning what comsumers would buy). If you plan to do business in photography, this is NOT a book for you.Aperture priority in some photos are wrongly used. Example: the girls at the gate with a cute basket of flowers. That is probably a 5.6 aperture. The point of focus (sharpness) fell on the fence! instead of girls faces or flowers. If soft focused is the point, you still want the sharpest area on the subject and not on the surroundings.Composition in photos: too busy and dsitracting from subjetc in my opinion.Secrets? There are no secrets revealed in this book unless it is the very first photography book that gets to your hands for the very first time."
2,"Ok, Was Hoping for More","This book is OK. I was really hoping for a book that focused more on utilization of sun/natural light without the use of reflectors and/or inclusion of flash.I feel that the photos are a bit dated, as is the layout of the book. It's just not as fresh and current as I'd have liked.For basic information it's fine, but truly it is just sitting on a shelf taking up space - I'd contemplated returning it, to be honest."
3,dated,"I found some of the technique in this book helpful, but it's redundant. The pictures in the book are not of high quality print and are dated. Overall, I was not satisfied with this book."
3,NOT THE SMARTEST ANGEL Unabridged 5cds audio,"When a little boy in the town of Pine Cove, witnesses the murder of someone in a Santa Claus suit, he turns to God for help. What he doesn't know is that God has already sent Raziel, not the smartest Angel, down to Earth to perform a Christmas Miracle. Naturally, things get wildly out of controlChristopher Moore wrote about of murder, sex, zombies, talking fruit bats and the miracle of Christmas.. When I first read this book last Christmas I had never read anything by Moore before, but I've read several since then. I don't mind dark humor or zombies but this is not as gripping as some of his other stories.Still, this book only gets 3 stars. Moore's other titles are far superior, with this one he seems to be coasting a bit. I'll look forward to Moore's next great epic. My pick of Christopher Moore novels would beLAMB A NOVEL: THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO BIFF, CHRIST'S CHILDHOOD PAL"
3,"Slight book, but very funny.","I have to admit that I have a history of picking up books solely for their covers, and both the title and cover of this one had me pick it up when it was displayed in my local library's Christmas Collection. Although the book is slight, it was quite the enjoyable read.The book's plot is simple, a child on his way back from a friend's house, sees a man in a Santa suit killed, and thinks he is somehow responsible. So he asks that Santa be brought back to life. This turns a town's Christmas festivities into a George Romero flick as ""The Stupidest Angel"" brings everyone in the graveyard where Santa got killed back to life.The book is not for people who are easily offended, but the laugh out loud humor and the nicely sketched wacky characters. And in true Christmas tradition, the book has a happy ending.The book is a nice, short introduction to Christopher Moore, an author I'm now making it a point to read more of."
3,"A slow starter, but typical Moore","RUN! CHRISTMAS ZOMBIES!I didn't find this to be as good as A Dirty Job was, but there is plenty of Moore's trademark absurdity and satire here. Some of the characters are a bit boring, including the Archangel Raziel, but there are a few that save the day -- in more ways than one. I quite enjoyed Molly, aka Kendra, the Warrior Babe of the Outland, who is more than a little not right. It's a bit slow getting there, but the holiday party and the ensuing chaos is worth the wait."
1,Lost interest 2 chapters in...,"I enjoyed Lamb, but I gave this 2 chapters and didn't see anything in it that caught my eye. Just didn't hold my interest."
2,Not great.,"We read this book for our December book club meeting because we wanted an easy, fun read during the holiday season. We were all disappointed. Though it is an easy read (not exactly great literature), the humor is crass and often offensive. I usually pass books on to friends after I read them, but not this one."
1,Never gets going - very disappointing after reading the Lamb,"As much as I loved the Lamb (5+ stars), I did not like The Stupidest Angel. The book wanders along here and there and never really gets going. There are a number of disjointed storylines that plod along and then are suddenly slammed together. The book had some funny parts, but overall, I found the book to be disappointing."
1,stupid stupid angel book,"I normally really enjoy his books, but this one really didn't appeal to me. Being familiar with the characters and location was fine, but the story lacked his usual creativity."
2,not worth it,"I tried to read this book, and tried and tried. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. There were a few great lines, I'll give it that. However, the occasional bon mot does not a good book make. It's a rather short book, so even though I didn't like it, I thought I would finish it anyway. I couldn't do it: I read up until about 1/2 to 3/4 of it and realized there are way too many other books I want to read for me to waste any more time on this one. I think it depends on the reader; I know someone who loved it. I'm just not one of those people."
2,Yet another Christmas return.,"I bought this book last night based on an NPR interview which billed it as hilarious. And the premise did sound hilarious.However, two pages into the book, I thought ""uh oh"". I kept thinking ""Geez, I could have written this.""The zingers don't zing. I think I snickered at one thing later in the book (I began skipping forward to see if it got better later).There also doesn't seem to be a cohesiveness to the book. Things just seem to be thrown out there, with not much build up.Seems like it was knocked out in a hurry to get it out for the Christmas buying season.Save your money. I'm going to get mine back tonight."
1,Stupid book,"I read a lot, some good and some bad. This is one of the worst books I have read. Glad it was short"
1,Plain & Simple ... HORRIBLE!,I think my title sums it up! I was utterly disgusted and disappointed by this book ... terrible & a waste of money!
1,The worst book I've ever read.,"Never judge a book by its cover! The cover looks sweet, charming even heartwarming. The story was awful. I did not expet dead people sucking brains out of the living at a Christmas party. Absolutely disgusting in every way."
5,A certain to be Christmas Tradition from now on!,"Oh how I love this book! Let me say it again, I love this book! From the angel to the bat Roberto, I love this book! It has Santa, Christmas, Zombies, Ikea, everything that one's heart hold dear! It all comes together nicely and hilariously! I have always loved Christopher Moore's books but this is one of my favorites! It is so wonderful and it has a extra called ""Christmas Spirit"" There are so many laugh out loud moments that I could never count them. If you are looking for a book around Christmas or even in the middle of the summer, please, give this one a read! You will not be sorry in the least bit!"
5,Laugh-Out-Loud Holiday Treat,"Moore's cynical wit and Robert's voice artistry make this a must have audiobook, especially when the holidays make you crazy. You'll learn what crazy really is."
5,Love this!,"If you like to color outside the lines occasionally, and like wonky stories, then this is for you. I have found that it is the perfect antidote for Holiday smarminess and is full of interesting characters who you'll instantly recognize as parts of people you know & love/hate. Who can't resist a holiday story with angels and zombies!"
4,Hilarious,"""The Stupidest Angel"" is one of my favorite Christopher Moore books to date. This is a very funny story involving a small town, a bunch of crazy characters, a rather dimwitted angel, a zombie invasion, and of course the many joys of the holiday season. What's not to love?! I especially enjoy how the book pokes fun at so many Christmas traditions, many of which are pretty ridiculous when you think about it. Like many of Moore's books, I feel that the story begins to drag a bit near the end, but still, if you enjoy satire and are looking for something to read over the holidays, this book should be it."
5,Great Book,"The Stupidest Angel is funny, clever, and surprizing. I got to like the characters; in fact I'd like to be their friend. They are real, vunerable,funny and really screwed up."
4,My first Moore read,"This is my first time reading a Christopher Moore book. It took a while for me to get into the book. I didn't really like the charactors at first, but warmed up to them about half way into the book. Being a big horror fan I was quite pleased when the book took a big turn into zombie territory. I will definitly read Moore's other books."
3,It takes a special type of person....,"I have read other books by this author before, so I suppose I should have been prepared for what was coming, but somehow I just wasn't. This book does have its merits. Some of the characters are pretty funny and as always, flawed to the point of being silly. The plot was just as ridiculous as you would expect if you have read this author's other books, and I did laugh at times. I still laughed though parts of this, but I found myself skimming the last scenes at the bar as they were just so off the chart dumb I didn't even care anymore. If you are looking for some easy humor and aren't easily offended by the thought of Christmas becoming a bloody rampage, this might be the book for you. The stupidest angel might just be the stupidest book ever."
2,Disappointing,"I have read 3 of Moore's other books. This one pales in comparison to his usual output.Moore takes his usual writing characteristics and exaggerates them. This creates a book that is boring and unreadable, unlike the pleasantly quirky books he usually writes. Moore has a gift for taking various different threads and then making it all fit together. Not so here. The story feels weak and disconnected. The characters are not believable either. They are polarized to the point of being absurd.Perhaps this is the effect Moore was going for. If it was, then it was not my cup of tea."
1,major disappointment,I bought this because Lamb is one of my favorite books of all time. It's hard to imagine that this was written by the same author.
1,"A few funny bits, but otherwise pointless","There are a few funny interactions of the oddball characters, but the climax isn't particularly exciting and the resolution is literally a deus ex machina. And the book was short, making it overall a poor investment."
2,Not particularly entertaining,"I didn't enjoy this book. This is my first Christopher Moore book, so all the reused characters were new to me. I didn't find any of them particularly likable. The only exception is Theo, whose marriage and money issues were relatable, although the guy was a bit of a dunce. Everyone else was an absurd caricature that was either too crazy, obnoxious, or irresponsible to be believable. The ""stupidest angel"" didn't bring much to the table either. Much of the humor fell flat and didn't elicit more than a chuckle from me. The plot meanders along until about 200 pages in when the 'twist' occurs, but by then I didn't care what happened to the characters. This all wraps up in a sugary sweet ending that makes the preceding 300 pages feel pointless. Just weak all around."
3,Moore's deft fantasy thriller,"Moore is clever and facile. He makes creative connections between the ordinary and the fantastic. His books are quick and enjoyable reads. But like cotton candy, there is immediate gratification and not much substance. Personally, I find Tom Robbins to be much deeper with infinitly more substance."
3,"Funny, but not outstanding","""The Stupidest Angel"" is a funny, off-beat Christmas story full of strange characters and dark humor. The funniest parts are told from a dog's perspective, and somehow seem authentically ""doggy."" But I got the sense that Christopher Moore was trying too hard, referring to his thesaurus too much, and generally trying to make a small California town seem more bizarre than it could possibly be. Generally, I liked the book until the last 70 pages, when the angel's ""Christmas miracle"" starts to come to life. Past that point, I just couldn't suspend my disbelief; it is too odd a combination of horror and humor, and I found it annoying instead of funny.I recommend John Grisham's ""Skipping Christmas"" for a hearty holiday laugh instead of ""The Stupidest Angel."""
2,Good book till the end,This book was moving along in a fun way .... then went off into stupid land. It was as if the author ran out of material. Would not recommend.
4,Very funny,"It took me a few chapters to get into this story. At first I thought the author was trying too hard to make the characters quirky and funny - it just seemed a bit forced. But once I got past all the character-setup, I enjoyed the story, and I look forward to reading more Christopher Moore."
2,Disappointed,"I have really enjoyed most of Christopher Moore's books, but compared to his other books, this one was underdeveloped, slow, and an overall weak story line."
4,Watch What You Wish For!,"Audio: This was one fun mess. Some of the lines were hysterical. The story is about a little town in California and the crazy folk who live there one horrifying Christmas. It's hard to describe it without giving away the plot. You have Tuck, the pilot who is drug spotting for the DEA, Theo, the pot smoking constable, Molly, the retired warrior princess, and Gabe, the behavioral scientist trying to figure out why men keep coming back to the women who hurt them."
5,Really fun read,The perfect holiday read!!! Kind of puts one in the true Christmas mood. Highly recommended!!!
3,A pretty stupid story,"My adult son and I both loved Christopher Moore's ""Lamb"" and ""You Suck"", so I bought him this one for Christmas. He hated it. Too far-fetched and just plain silly. I listened to it and actually I found it OK: some interesting characters, but the story went a little crazy with dead bodies fighting the town people. Not scary, just silly."
4,MY Angle on the Angel,"I'm a huge Christopher Moore fan, have enjoyed all of his writings to date, and this book met all my expectations of wit, wry humor, and warped storylines featuring many of the eccentric personalities I've grown to know and adore in Pine Cove and from other Moore books. I recommend starting with ""Practical Demonkeeping"" (the first book in Christopher Moore's series and the reader's intro to Pine Cove) and following his array of books in the order he's written them. All are winners, just some more special than others. Enjoy!"
4,"Delightfully ""WRONG"" !!!","How to explain Christopher Moore......you can't!!! This book is the anti-traditional Christmas book. How else to explain the screw-up Angel coming to accomplish a mission that winds up involving an ""off-her-meds"" B movie actress, a stoned constable, a DEA pilot and ""zombies"" searching for a meal!!! This was outrageously whack, delightfully ""wrong"" and a fantastic step away from tradition. If your head needs a breath of fresh air this is a good choice."
5,AWESOME Christmas Story,"Christopher Moore's story of one particular Christmas in small town California is hilarious. It shows the residents of this town in all of their imperfections, nosy, slimy, sanity-challenged, et al, with a sense of humor not found in any other story I've read. The story has a true heard that is sorely needed when mixing a time of Christmas celebration and the undead.A note of caution: The book contains extremely brief risque conversations between characters and, of course, hungry undead.A must read for anyone over the age of 16 and under 40!!!"
4,It starts out weird and gets very strange indeed,"I had read Coyote Blue and didn't enjoy it. I started Lamb and gave it up. For some reason, The Stupidest Angel kept me amused while I zipped through it. Sure, it's violent and gross and lurid, but the story hung together, getting more interesting almost to the end. The book screams out to be filmed, and it will be an instant parody of accepted cinematic cliches, if somebody takes on the project.But I won't bother with another Christopher Moore book until I find another one with consistent 5-star ratings."
1,The Stupidest Book,"Well, I hate to say it, but if I were to rename this book it would have been ""The Stupidest Book"" This was a book club selection, so I stuck with it through the most amazing dumb ""plot"" (of sorts). Or maybe I just need a humor transplant. If you want quirky characters, Pine Cove, California is the place to go. Everything from the police officer who grows pot to buy an ancient Japanese sword for his girlfriend, the ex-adventure/porn star with mental problems who thinks she's still an avenger when off her meds to a pilot with a talking sun-glasses wearing fruit bat named Roberto to the bar owner who laces her Christmas fruitcake with Xanax and XTC, through the entire town and down to the dim-witted angel sent to earth to grant a child's wish and in the process turns an entire cemetery into an attacking hoard of zombies. I loved Moore's earlier ""Lamb: The Gospel according to Biff Christ's Childhood Pal,"" but this one just didn't do it for me!"
4,"Very odd, in a twisted way!","I must say this guy knows how to loosen the moral fibers of one of our most important Christian days. He steps on most that is near and dear to our beliefs and understanding of the birth of our Lord. That being said, thew book is intertaining and while rude is never outright filthy. I would not tell everyone about it, only people who can understand solid black humor and full on tongue and cheek humor at it full power."
3,Funny but zanny parts slow the reading,"Moore draws us in with a mountain of monstrous metaphors as he introduces an equally outrageous cast of characters, including a giant fruit bat from Micronesia who (which) wears sun glasses and speaks at a crucial point.It's a good cast and wonderful writing until we discover the weakness of the plot. The goal of the angel appears forged only to put the crazy characters in action, and it borders on the absurd when they wrestle with zombies out for their brains.It kept me amused, but unsatisfied when I finished.ernesrschusky.com"
2,The stupidest Angel,It was really stupid! I did not think it was at all well written. The whole story was juvenile. I would not recommend it.
5,Stupidest angel,What a ride. Once more Christopher Moore draws a bizarre and hilariously funny story that hits dangerously close to home.
4,Fun read,"I love Moore's sense of humor. This novel is a fun, fast read, revisiting characters from earlier novels, with a side order of zombies."
5,The Stupidest Angel,I bought this for a friend after recieving this as a gift last Christmas. Wonderful story and a very fast read.
5,A new Christmas tradition is born!,"Christopher Moore is a sick, twisted, demented, person, and probably a communist as well. But he writes an incredible story... twists and turns you won't see coming, laugh out loud moments, and a strange obsession with whale genitalia.... Buy this book. Buy all his books. Buy his books and give them to your friends."
1,DISGRACE,"Amazon should not allow dvds of this sort. The quality is almost at a point that you cannot make out the identity of the actors. That is how poor the quality is.At $14.95, it makes it highway robbery."
2,a quality print is hard to find,The Braun media print is a poor transfer and their source must have been bad. I would recommend the Platinum / Echp Bridge transfer which also has other films included in The Great American Western series.
5,Amazing!,"I LOVE this product! I recenlty purchased this product for myself and I love it! I have extrememly course, curly and super thick hair. (it's been compared to lambs wool and a brillo pad in texture). Anyway straightening my hair has always been a nightmare. Until now, the switch it is amazing. It is time saving and does a superior job of straightening and flipping. Normally it takes me about 2 or more hours to just straighten my hair. Within a hour using the switch I was done and it looked amazing. If feels smoother, shiny, and soft. I can say this is the first time I have ever used a straighter and I started smiling at how wonderful it turned out. Now I can easily style my hair with 20 to 45 minutes. Yeehaw If I could hug the inventor I would. Thank you! Just remember to style with your hair dry (not for damp/wet hair) and have fun."
2,not the best choice,"I decided to get this product after read the comments above. However, I don't think it's as good as what they said or what I expected. When I tried to close its two sides to flat my hair, they're not completely close so that the result is not as good as the regular iron. The material is a little bit poor and it's not very hot like what they described. So it's not a good choice to curl my hair because it take too much time. I'm a little bit disapointed"
3,It is very heavy.,This works better if someone else uses it on you because of the weight. I read about wieght issue before I bought it but thought I could live with it. It's a two man utensil.
5,Great motivational book with revealing personal stories,"Great motivational tools to help strenghten your commitment to the Lord. Michael speaks from the heart, revealing personal accounts of how he has learned the importance of God in his life through struggles. This book makes you take a self-inventory as you read along to see how you can better yourself."
3,Rape of the Fair Country,"Rape of the Fair Country is the first of a trilogy of books which were recommended to me by a Welsh friend.They are historical novels, written 50 years ago by a Welsh author.The books should be read in order:Rape of the Fair CountryHosts of RebeccaSong of the EarthI have read the first two and found them informative, entertaining but depressing as they follow a poor Welsh family for two generations, suffering from exploitation by coal mine owners, foundry owners, absentee landowners and the authorities in 19th CenturyWales.It would help to have a map of Wales nearby when you read it and a friend who could explain some of the terms and expressions used.I have already passed the book on to another friend and am now searching for the 3rd book."
4,Nancy Collins illustrated,"A very dark graphic novel - also a must read for fans of Sonja Blue. I enjoy comics, though I am not an avid reader. I found this to be a beautifully drawn book. Being a fan of Nancy Collins, I also enjoyed the story."
3,These episodes will change your mind.,"I was so excited for Armada to be released on TV. I held my breath in anticipation, and made sure nobody bothered me the day of the premiere. And, like many G1 fans.... I was disappointed. I didn't make any effort to watch the show for quite some time. It was these episodes on this set that made me accept, and even LIKE the show. I don't have this set yet, but I would definately buy it. The episodes near the end with Prime, Megatron, and Unicron all confronting each other... that's really good stuff!"
1,Focused on developer tools,"Published in 1983. 199 pages. The author delivers lip service to his title ""The KISS Principle."" There is minimal discussion of software design with its associated ""keep it simple stupid"" principal. The first chapter covers the lessons learned from several small projects. This book advocates various software development tools in areas such as project management, diagramming, automatic code generators, structured design, editors, word processors, portable terminals, record management, and email."
2,This book is no longer of interest,"Unless you are a student of older systems technologies this book is no longer of interest. I am not a programer, but I suspect that a book on structuring the flow of information is not an issue when applets already take care of these issues. I even suspect the speed of modern computers makes this whole issue moot."
3,Middle of the Road Stevie,I still get Excited about a New Stevie WOnder Album or Song even though it's been 20 Years since He came Correct all the way through to me.this song was Alright it had a momen tor two nothing more or less.still looking to His New Album due soon.
4,Great book!,"This book is really pretty darn good! It makes things pretty interesting when you are not interested in History. I use it and I am homeschooed in the 8th grade. I will also use it next year, it's a great two year program. I don't know why the other two reviewers didn't like it but I find it a lot better than previous history books."
4,Backup textbook,It is a very comprehensive textbook but ... it is very heavy to carry it every day to/from school. So I purchased this book as a backup for my daughter to lighten her daily backpack load. It is fairy clean.
3,Eh.....,"I bought it for school since they don't offer physical textbooks anymore... If you're not buying it because you are required to for school, then I wouldn't pick this textbook because it's slightly outdated and isn't very comprehensive."
4,Very Pleased,"The Modern World History, Patterns of Interaction met my expectations and more. I am completely pleased with the entire transaction, the book itself was in better condition than I had expected and it arrived quite promptly. It is a relief to simply not have to deal with a bad experience. This was a completely positive one. Thank you!"
3,Average World History Book,"World History Patterns of Interaction is a fairly good book for the basics, but the authors do not do the best at linking everything together. The pictures complements the text nicely. But the book is not geographically split into chapters it is chronological (A bit frustrating for me). The book concentrates on the details that are not of great value. There are better world history books in the market."
4,Back to school,"This is an old school text book. Now, I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, but just be warned.There are some of my children's text books I thought were very good and I wanted to keep them. If you feel the same, here is your chance."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I did receive the book I ordered quickly. However, the book that I was sent was GARBAGE! It was listed in ""very good"" condition when it should have been listed in ""trash"" condition. This experience was a total waste of my time & hope. The book had massive amounts of highlighting, underlining, & graffiti throughout. The binding of the book had been taped back together. The cover was excessively beat up. No, I didn't contact the seller because if they really cared about customer service they wouldn't have misrepresented the condition of the book. If they truly cared they wouldn't have insulted me by sending me garbage through the mail! Thanks for the disappointment ecampus, just what I've always wanted."
1,This textbook is Fatally Flawed,"A group of concerned citizens in Florida have questioned the apparent bias in this textbook, a bias against Western Civilization. The text has an anti western, anti capitalist, anti Christian and anti Jewish bias, and conversely promotes Eastern and Middle Eastern cultures and promotes Islam as a religion.These concerned parents have approached the local school board and asked that this text be removed from the approved list of instructional materials. They were initially rebuffed, but the matter is now pending appeal before the entire Sarasota County School Board. This is the first time in history that such an appeal has ever been granted.I strongly urge readers to find out if your local School Board has approved of this text, and if so, to file a formal complaint with the School District Superintendent (not at the school level)."
3,Mom8643,"Book never showed up via mail!!(even after 5wks), BUT Seller was kind enough to deliver in person!!! Thank you!"
4,Criminal Justice,CJ interest justifies this text. My instructor recommends this is the one book to keep for a reference. This is an older editiion but still a valuable resource.
5,changüisa,"Drawing from traditional Cuban sounds, in Rústico, Pedro Luis Ferrer creates with gusto, bravado, and intelligence a brand new genre: changüisa, a mix of changuí, trova espirituana, and coros de claves. He has also created steamy debates by singing the oppressive feelings Cubans face today, as we can hear in the song ""¿Cómo Viviré?"" (""How will I live? / If I'm watched everywhere I go/ if my money is worthless/ if I'm alienated and no one listens/...Hunger and waiting are allowed/ Are allowed fear and absence/ Love is proscribed."")"
5,Way back when.....,"Now I have them on hand.I remember these songs when I was a kid. The majority reliesed before my time, but remembered as much of Christmas as any other part of the Holiday."
2,Disappointing,This is not the album I remember from my child hood my parents would play. Maybe I purchased the wrong album
4,Great classic songs for the holiday seasons. A little something for everyone. CD oFfers a easy listening experience,Great classic songs for the holiday seasons. A little something for everyone. CD oFfers a easy listening experience especially when it the kitchen
5,Love it,My kids and I love it! This CD has all of the great classic christmas music. Time life never lets me down!
2,Let the buyer beware!,"... this version of the 2-CD ""Time-Life Treasury of Christmas"" (which contains only 24 songs) is, by far, NOT the 2-CD version sold on television by Time-Life Music (which, in turn, contains 45 songs). Of these 45 songs on the second set, only 7 are featured on the first set, namely: ""Home for the Holidays"" by Perry Como; ""White Christmas"" by Bing Crosby; ""Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" by Gene Autry; ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" by Roger Whittaker; ""Mary's Boy Child"" by Harry Belafonte; ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" by Brenda Lee; and ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by the Harry Simeone Chorale. That's it.If you want to know the other 38 songs featured in the ""As Shown on TV"" version of ""The Time-Life Treasury of Christmas"", I recommend you log on to ... for a complete listing of songs. Only then, depending on the songs and artists you like most, can you make a wise decision on which specific 2-CD set you will want to purchase."
1,What a Rip-Off,I have the original Time Life Treasury of Christmas Set. Same Cover ect. Unfortunately I scratched Disc B and wanted to replace it. The original set had 22 songs on disc A and 23 on disc B. All great classics. Now Time-Life is trying to sell half the music for twice the price. Forget it. What's here just isn't worth the money.
2,I'd Give it 2.5 if I Could..but,"The songs here are lovely and are sure to invoke childhood memories and the holiday spirit, however, despite having the same picture on the front, this is NOT the same Time-Life Christmas CD set you've seen advertised on TV. THAT set you can order directly from Time-Life...and it contains over twice as much music and the songs are performed by differnt classic performers. Considering what you get, I'll spend a little extra and order it there. I'm sure this CD set will please, but I think it's deceptive that Time-Life is marketing this with the same name and cover given the significant differences between the two sets."
3,Great Material But....,"This CD contains some of the true Christmas classics, sure to bring back the memories. ...But its priced as a 2-CD set. Sure you get 2 CDs, but at aproximately 30+ minutes of material per disk. That seems a little deceptive. I'd expect better of a Time-Life product. Most people will easily be able to think of at least a handful of songs that will make them say, ""this could be even better if they'd included..."""
2,Should have been sold as one CD.,"The music itself is fantastic but as the other reviewers have mentioned, the songs could have all fit into one CD. I have the original 2-CD set from TV, but frequent use took its toll so I bought this one. I listen to this copy often as well, but am a bit slighted by the undisguised attempt to charge more for less."
3,Not the same,"As the other reviewers have said, this is NOT the packed CD advertised around the holidays. There are fewer songs, though they are certainly classics."
2,Too sparse for two CD's,"Most of the material on the disks is good and some is tough to find on other compilations, but as another reviewer pointed out all of the songs on both CD's could be fit onto a single CD. The only possible reason for putting it on two CD's instead of one is to charge more money. It's never fun to get gouged as a consumer, but it's even less fun to get gouged by the largest media conglomerate in the world at Christmas."
3,okay,I thought since it was Time-life it would have more traditional well known songs. Disappointed - should've looked at the song list first.
4,Excellent collection,"This has quite a few of the top Christmas songs. Unfortunately, there are a few ""filler"" tunes that I skip over, including ""Baby's First Christmas"" and ""Mary's Boy Child"" ... not sure why they were included except that the publishers maybe couldn't get the rights to include Judy Garland's ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and a few others that are really staples."
4,Treasury of Christmas,"I bought the vinyl album over 20 yrs ago & loved it. This cd is nice, but does not have all the songs the vinyl album did, so it was a little disappointing, but a great cd if you don't know what you're missing."
2,Un-Ho-Ho-Holy Marketing Practice Equals Deception,"Like the others said, this 2-CD set is NOT the same as the one seen on TV advertised by Time-Life despite the title (The Time-Life Treasury of Christmas) AND the CD cover (with a serene wintery scene of a dainty red house with snow-capped roof emanating a warm glow through its windows and of a young boy on the porch waving at the occupants of a passing horse-drawn sleigh) of the sets being COMPLETELY identical. I have the 2-CD set that I've order direct through Time-Life and this set has TWICE the number of songs.That's just deceptive marketing practice. Caveat emptor!"
5,hopeful,I have this album from 1986. had put it on cassette but was hoping they made it on cd. cant fird it. it is a great collection
2,Poor Quality,"The only good thing about this collection is the inclusion of so many Christmas standards. I was very disappointed in the quality of the recordings, they obviously need digital inhancement."
5,An essential collection for Christmas,"If you enjoy the classic Christmas songs, done by the artists most associated with them, this is the 2-CD set for you!When I'm looking to set the holiday mood in the house, these two discs are the first to be played. From Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"" to Gene Autry's ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" you can't help but feel the holiday cheer erase the hectic commotion that can sometimes clutter up this time of year."
4,Good CD set for an Old Fashioned Christmas,"I ordered this set through a catalogue about 12 years ago. I'm glad I did. This is a wonderful set of older songs to get you in the holiday mood. Starting with Bing's White Christmas, it also contains his version of Do You Hear What I Hear, which has become a favorite of mine. It also has the album version of Perry Como's Home For The Holidays. Other chestnuts include Burl Ives' Holly Jolly Christmas and Harry Belafonte's immortal Mary's Boy Child. But the song that knocked me over when I first heard it was Roger Whittaker's Ding Dong Merrily on High. The ringing of the bells and the musical arrangement were stunning to me. Plus it's a song you rarely hear at all. Another rare track is Elvis' If Every Day Was Like Christmas. I still give this set a spin during the holidays. I would highly recommend this set of holiday songs for your collection."
4,Not such a bad deal,"There are a lot of people complaining this is not the same CD as the one shown on TV. True, It is not the same and it does not have the same name. The Time-Life ones are called Volume 1 and Volume 2, the two available on Amazon.com are special compilations of the most memorable christmas songs, at a ver nice price."
3,All the Classics,"I'm a big Christmas Music fan - I've got over 20 CDs, which is a lot for just one month's worth a listening a year. This CD is a great start for any collection.It's got all the classic recordings by the quintessential artists. You won't find Britney Spears doing Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer - it's Gene Autry, thank you very much.If you just want something to put on after Thanksgiving or while you're wrapping presents, this is a good choice. It'll get you in the Christmas mood."
2,H0-Hum For Christmas,"For a 2-CD set this should have about twice as many songs on it with a ton more atrists. Good stuff, but not enough of it."
2,Boring,"I am 38 years old and bought this CD trying to get into the christmas spirit for the wife and kids. However, my wife and I didn't grow up in the era of these musicians, and our parents didn't listen to them much either. So the album is pretty boring for us. Might be good in a department store."
2,THIS IS NOT THE SAME ONE ON TV!,I thought this was the same one as on TV but it's not. I think Amazon should have made some sort of disclaimer about this but buyer beware!
2,confused,"Looking at the album cover, I thought that I was buying the original album, and then the confusion set in when I looked at the play list of songs. There are a lot of songs that are repeated.So can Time Life get it right or has the seller altered the album to how he thinks the songs should be listed and sung by his choosing."
4,Little slower for these guys but still good,"Definately pop punk. Not as catchy and powerful as ""Bleed"" or ""And Now"" but not as hard and raw as ""What Happens Next"" or any of their earlier stuff. These guys have been around a while and definately have kept from being dated. Wish they would tour more!"
4,"An OutKast Fan, ...","* I would not recomend this cd to you because it doesn't give you the value of ""The Way You Move Pt.2"" or ""The Way You Move [Canada CD]"". The mixes are not as good on this CD!!! But if you are below the age of 13; I would recommend this CD. It's clean. The best track would probably be: The Way You Move [Johnny Toobad Radio Mix]. (The Way You Move [Canada CD] is a better deal.)"
4,Sketchbook Worth the Walk,"This book was a gift, purchased for someone who recently celebrated a 50th wedding anniversary and to accompany a card by Marjolein Bastin. The illustrations are every bit as lovely as the cards and capture her particular perspective on nature and the native grass preserve. Some might call Bastin a commercial artist or an illustrator rather than a ""serious painter,"" but here she illustrates one of her passions--a native grass preserve and the birds it attracts on the Missouri/Kansas prairie. I reccommend the book as does the person to whom I gave it.[I particularly liked the ""belted cow"" from Holland!]"
1,One for the archives ..............,"Danny is a much better player now than he was when he made this. His tendencies towards flamboyance and grandiosity are too much in evidence here. This, his second album, was recorded in 1987 when the Synclavier was still in production, and its use here does not suit this style of music, except on ""Ice Drops"", where poor production nevertheless spoils the good elements, as it does on every track.The work of most instrumentalists improves dramatically during their careers, so listen to his most recent albums and work back. You won't get as far as this one."
5,"Sick, Twisted, Odd, AMAZING","I recently read Carlton Mellick III's Satan Burger, at first I was kind of freaked out by it but by half way through I couldnt put it down! He definetly is one of the best writers Ive read in a while and he definetly wrote a sick, twisted, odd, and amazing book with Satan Burger. BUY IT!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED"
1,Ugh,"Overrated. OOooo, look at me, I write something weird. Oooo look at me, i'm so cool. There are rarely good parts to the story or interesting characters. The main character is dull, no question. The writing is dull for the most part. There are a few pasages that are written well and inspired, but for the most part...I just finished it to finish it."
2,Not as good as expected...,"I decided to read this book based on the other reviews and what it was linked to. All in all, it is an... interesting... book. It is very surreal, kind of annoying in its occasional shock for the sake of shock attitude, but for the most part, it has a good plot and subject. The writing is very mediocre. He makes up words, and uses childish vocabulary, possibly to prove some kind of point that never revealed itself to me. I, like a few of the other reviewers, did not get the ending. Last thing? About halfway through, I stopped wanting to finish the book, but I did anyway. Good or bad?"
1,"Amateurish, Juvenile, Unreadable","Folks, this is a cautionary tale -- not the content of ""Satan Burger"" mind you, but the fact that it exists. Was it self published? If so, please let somebody professional in the craft of writing take a look at your work before you put it out there. Otherwise you wind up with something like this, a bathroom-y, high school type mishmash of unconnected writing. Not that there isn't a spark here, an exuberance, but jeeze...I guess I should have been warned off by the cover, truely off-putting, but I am a fan of surrealist, dystopian sci-fi, and was suckered in by the reviews. I can usually get through a book if the ideas are interesting, even if the writing is sub-par -- that's what you often get if you like more alternative sci-fi. But even my lowest expectations were left far behind in this one.Just a friendly warning."
5,Wow - Satan Burger Rocks,"This book is amazing. I won't compare Carlton Mellick III to other authors, because though there are some stylistic similarities, no other author that I have read has spoken to me so succinctly. This book is terrific on so many levels. Satan Burger conveys a message that is both universal and relevant to current cultural trends and the social climate.Yay Satan Burger!"
3,"Eh, not my thing.","I thought I would check out Carlton Mellick and see if he was for me. So, I bought this book and read it. Well, it was okay, but failed to follow any story with a decent plot and I found myself really forcing myself to read it. I thought the story was cute at first. Then it just got to be annoying. I'm surprised other reviews have been so positive."
4,Sick and Weird,"I don't know, this was some outre weird sick stuff, but it kept me laughing, and the writer has a wild imagination. I'll have to read what else he's publishing before making a final assessment."
2,Just horrible,"Junk book...Nothing compared to Clevenger, Baer, Palahniuk... from whom I got to know this guy."
3,Decent...,"I wasn't terribly impressed by ""Satan Burger"". Though the characters were pretty fleshed out and some of the themes were deep-rooted, I couldn't get past the lack of conflict. I could tell that this book was very biographical for Mellick, and I'm sure he poured a lot into it, but the story suffered for lack of direction. Yet, I must say I did enjoy reading the book. Carlton's writing style is unique, and I appreciated his views on religion. Go in with an open mind and you'll still find bits of satisfaction within the pages."
2,Professional?,"This book read like its editor was maybe a friend of the writer. Someone who's never edited anything but maybe their own shopping list. The book is a series of weird things made up by the author that usually don't have anything to do with one another. There is not much story here, just lots of jumbled ideas. The way the author presents them, though, lacks good prose style. Hmmm... I think the author must be someone that read Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions and was really into the photocopied 'zine world. It reads like an amateur, immature, rough version of things the author has read in the past. I finished it, though, so I am giving it 2 stars."
2,Just Too Silly,"There were some downright funny moments in this book. Regretfully, they were few and far between. For the most part, it was just a rambling exercise of imagination. Much of its perspective seemed juvenile, which is to be expected; he wrote it while very young.I'm sure his newer work is much improved."
2,"Yeah it`s an ""anti-novel"".............",".........But the reason we read books like this is to be entertained. Satan`s fast food restaurant is filled with VCR`s that can`t take someone`s order, Leaf has ""God`s Eyes"" that allow him to float to somewhere else, Wanna be Pirates, fascination and being turned on by Jesus. This book is really wild , but at some point I`m waiting for the pay-off. The part of the book where it all comes together. For me, even reading about the ""Blue Women"", that moment never came. ""The dolphin shocked me when he (?) picked up the accordian that was lying in the pool and began to play Wagner when Alisa said, ""The toast comes before the butter God dammit!!""""If those passages were in a ""Carlton Mellick III"" ANTI-NOVEL I`d be popular too. While a number of people gushed over this book, maybe I just don`t get it. A little more of The Silence might have done it for me...........who knows."
3,"Interesting, but a bit juvenile","I have to say that I enjoyed reading this odd mix of childish surrealism and anarchic philosophy. It was compelling and exposed a good writer...though perhaps in the rough. I felt like some of the author's ""teenage angst"" type of outlook was ladled on with a heavy hand. I got the impression that he thought he was the first person to come up with the notion of boredom as a horror, the first person to whom many of his ideas occurred. I can't say I didn't like this work at all, but I do believe a few years of age and maturity will help this author pour out better work."
5,mmmMMMMM! Satan burgers!,"Squishy, batter-dipped, soul-stealing cheeseburgers are deep-fried by our own resident homosexual ex-arch angel himself, Satan, while an overweight, lard-bellied messiah scrubs the bathroom floors with a crusty mop and bucket. Behind the counter stand your servers, consisting of a pierced and tattooed skin-head babe and an Asian kid who thinks he's a pirate. Aaargh! It's your modern day family restaurant! Just beware of the living, breathing demon-possessed appliances and the scorpion flies hovering above, waiting to paralyze you. Better get yourself a female baboon!Most books can't hold my attention for long. I consider myself more film oriented. But CM3's ""Satan Burger"" has breathed new life into a long dead literary world for me. This book is captivating and humorous like no book I've read before, and shows what a little style and imagination can do. This anti-novel should be required reading for all the *shrugging* school systems in America!Now, pass the ketchup."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. I embrace unusual and different styles of fiction. However, this just seemed like a desperate attempt to throw in as many random variables just for oddities sake without any plausible connection to the main story line. There were a few nuggets of philisophical ideas that were interesting but all in all it was not what I expected."
4,"its only entertainment, dont take it for anything else","heaven is closed and nobody cares about anything. people use the bathroom in the middle of the floors, satan sells food for souls to stay in business and a cemetary where the dead write their own biographies for others to read. yeah, the title and cover will either make you want to read this or run from it. if you do read, take it as it is, dont put anything into it, it is not meant to damn us to hell for reading it, its purely entertaining and thats it. mellick does a good job describing how things would be if the universe goes haywire and the population can die but not go anywhere but turn into a zombie and slowly wait for whats left of them to slip away. there is a chapter in the book where they are having a concert and it starts to rain and the people go mad- you have to read the rest. cool book, nice flow and remember its just entertainment."
3,Awesome idea,"I had mixed feelings going into this book. Upon reading, I note that Mellick definitely has a taste for the fantastic- and the setting starts very lived-in, which is always good for a surreal book. I had trouble identifying with the characters a bit, and that made the ending a bit narmy for me. I understand that this is one of his earlier books, and it shows. If reworked and tightened up this would be an epic book. As is, just ok."
5,"What is ""What is Mathematics""???","It's a lucid presentation of the ideas that govern the different domains of Mathematics. Clear but not too easy, it needs commitment by the reader in order to understand its essence to the full. Courant (as his mentor Hilbert) shows how important and useful it is to demystify the cumbersome technicalities that often dominate the subject."
4,The Invisible Second Author,"The purpose of this review is to bring your attention to the second author of this timeless classic. Apparently most reviewers give all the credit to the first author, Richard Courant. Allow me to bring the second author, Herbert Robbins, to your attention. Google his name and you will find that Herbert Robbins is one of the most prolific and creative statisticians ever existed. Robbins studied mathematics at Harvard in the 1930s. At the time he worked with Courant on this book, he was a young rising star in mathematics/statistics. I have every reason to believe that Robbins has done more to this book than we give him credit for. We may never know the exact magnitude of Robbins's contribution to this book, but a complete ignorance of him is certainly unjust."
1,Its a mess!,"The formulas in this book have a lot of errors, missing signs and characters makes them impossible to understand.I guess the original book was ported to Kindle by an automated script and they never verified it properly."
3,Good movie,"If you are interested in Venezuelan cinema, this is a representation of what this industry is producing. Nice effort!"
4,twins,"I had been looking for this book for years! Multiple births are So intersting and this book describes ""how twins happen"", ""nature vs. nuture"", separated twins who met later in life. Interesting and informative."
4,Amazon typo,"I've heard its a very good book series but this is not so much a review, I just wanted to note that the title on the weblisting of this book has inver(te)brates incorrectly spelled."
3,HP 100 for an HP 8450,"I purchased one of the $12.99 Gray Cartridges, and as the other reviewer said the ink ran out in less than half of amount of printing a brick and mortar store cartridge would have given me.Office Max has HP 100 cartridges $24.99. I guess I'll stay local until someone can show me a better cartridge.It should have had 14ml (milliliters) in it. That is the amount shown on HP's home site. HP's site has them for $23.99 next day delivery with a box of 4""x6"" paper if you by two cartridges. That is a $19.99 bonus, and Office Max will give you $3.00 for every empty printer cartridge, up to $15.00.Thank you for reading this,Cleve D. LeClairEugene, Oregon"
1,Defective and passed return date,"Received cartridge and installed it in printer. Did not print anything for about a month and a half. When I went to pring I got a blank page. Removed it and I could see where there was a leak at the seam where some ink had run down, rest probably dried. Went to check on possibility of replacement and discovered that return date had passed. Oh well, the man wins again! Will try buying one at some other distributor."
1,Scandalous digital rights management before anything has been written,"As a global citizen, I relocate quite frequently. My last HP Printer that I had purchased in the US would not accept print cartridges bought in Europe or South Africa. There is a complicated procedure to re-regionalize your printer, but that can be done only once. While I can see some logic in the arguments (although I do not share them) of the hollywood film oligolopolists on their DRM approaches, in the case of printer ink it borders on roadside robbery.Is this where we are going: digital rights managed even BEFORE something has even been written?Lawyers (and profiteers) on the rampage!Absurd."
4,It works,"It works, though the leather case is not the greatest. However, in consideration of the price you can't beat it!"
5,Great Kit,"Great value for price paid. The charger functions as designed with the Razr V3 phone. The case is not Gucci quality (but neither was the price), but it is functional and provides protection against scratches and dings encountered in normal usage."
1,Case is useless,"I got totally different looking case in the mail. The case won't fit properly and opening are designed so bad, I could not connect usb wire through that. This case does not provide much protection to the phone as there are large open spaces. Front and back parts are joined by elastic band that looks so bad.Make sure you got delivered the kit that you see while ordering."
1,At least it wasn't a complete loss,"The case, as everyone else has stated, makes a very attractive phone look very ugly really quick. The charging port cut out's measurements must have been estimated. BELIEVE everyone's comments! If you want a good case, look into the ""Body Glove Scuba II Case for Motorola RAZR V3"". Learn from the rest of us. If you spent the money for the razr, spend a little extra for the case. If it were not for the charger then I would have been out of the few bucks I spent with nothing to show for it."
1,Picture a phoney,I was disappointed that the case I received was different from the picture and it was hard to get the phone to fit in the case. The charger was fine and the right one for the phone.
1,THE WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE,"WHAT I RECEIVED HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ""PICTURED"" PRODUCTAND TO ADD INSULT TO MY WASTED TIME; AMAZON CHARGED FORSHIPPING & RETURN CLAIMING THAT THE BUYER HAS CHANGED HIS MIND.SHORT & LONG OF IT;THIS WILL BE THE LAST PRODUCT I WILL EVER PURCHASE THROUGH AMAZON.COMI GUARANTEE IT"
5,Great cookbook,"I received this cookbook for my 14th birthday. The first recipe I tried was the pinwheels. My family and friends loved them. All the recipes I have tried turned out great, but everyone's favorite was the fresh lemon bars.The recipes are easy to follow and simple to make even for a first time baker like me, and, most importantly, they taste great. The book also has large, colorful pictures of the finished creations. Each recipe gives an approximate amount of calories for the weight watchers.I would highly recommend this book."
5,Best Baking Cookbook,"I checked out this book from the library prior to my son's first birthday party to come up with some recipes to use for his birthday cake. All of the recipes I tried came out great and I was asked for them at my son's party. I loved the cookbook so much that my mother-in-law offered to buy me a copy and she also bought a copy for herself. My mom really liked it too, so I got her a copy. For Christmas this year, I am giving it to all my aunts because I think they will find it to be a great resource too. One of my favorite recipes in the book is the gingerbread cookie recipe. I highly recommend this cookbook."
5,Straight Ahead Swinging Jazz,"""For Basie"" has Shad Collins, Paul Quinichette, Jo Jones, Freddie Green, Walter Page and Nat Pierce on piano. There are five tunes and on each the three horns have space to stretch out which they do. It's quite a swinging affair. It nicely complements ""Basie Reunion"" which has a similar line up."
4,a great story that has a cumulative effect,Our 3 year old loved rhyming the names and re-reading the story to us. The illustrations embellished the words and stirred his imagination.
1,Lame,"I'm a great fan of L. Neil Smith's and bought the book for that story alone. I shouldn't have bothered. His story made a good philosophical point about the peace process, but was lacking in terms of the apparent theme of the book. The other stories left me cold, and didn't sustain even a single reading.At least I bought it used so I wasn't out much cash."
2,Not as funny as I thought it would be.,"I know there are many, many more episodes of Red Skelton that were much funnier than the ones they put on this dvd. I was really disappointed in the ones that were selected for this package. I gave it to my dad for a gift, and watched it with him. Some of them were okay, but I know Red Skelton is hilarious, but they didn't do his show justice on this dvd package."
2,Red,Skelton was a funny man. The selections used on this set are not his best. But it does give you an idea about this funny guy.
3,No Closed-captioning,"Red Skeleton is still great, but this disc was advertised as being Closed-captioned. Since my wife is deaf, she is going to miss all of the clever dialogue. But, at least Red Skeleton is also quite visually humorous."
5,classics,"i purchased this set for my 30 year old son who named his new puppy earl cadidlehopper. He new who Red was from his childhood, but his kids and wife didn't so they needed educated. He loves them."
5,Love it!,"This CD has become a staple for me to gift when going to baby showers and when friends/family have babies. My daughter is now one year old and we have relied on this CD in the car to keep her calm for over 6 months and it always works. The music is very soothing, but still upbeat. Sometimes she sleeps to it, sometimes she dances to it. I think she really likes that it is an adult voice alongside of children's voices.I have since purchased the Chrisrtmas Praise Baby CD which is also wonderful!"
1,Wow! Why is it so expensive?,"When you calculate the price per disk, you are paying an astounding $43.33 per CD. If you buy individual J.C. disks at $10 bucks apiece, you could buy 26 separate CDs and get much, much more music. Most (if not all) of this music is previously released.""Cash: The Autobiography"" is only $7.99 here at Amazon and is a much better read than this picture book. You can also buy a poster here for $7.97 to hang on your wall.Buy a book, a poster, and 10 Johnny Cash CD's of your choice and save your cash cash."
5,Amazing!,"This is an absolutely fabulous collection. The steep pricing it definitely deterring, however if you subscribe to Yahoo! Music Unlimited you can get the whole thing plus approximately 1,000,000 other songs for $6.99 month. Happy Listening. :)"
5,Great stir fry pan!,"This is a great buy. It's hard to find a nonstick hard anodized pan this large with a glass cover (which fits fine) at the price. And with the ""Quantanium"" non-stick surface, I could use metal utensils if I wanted along with the benefit of easy clean up. Also, please note that it's flat-bottom--I have a ceramic stove top and even calling Cuisinart didn't clear that up. I decided to take the risk and order it and it was indeed flat. Recommended!"
3,"It lasts for 2 years, then coating starts to peel off","This was purchased on 2007. After 2 years of regular use, we used it about 3 times a week for chinese stir fry cooking, wash it only with yellow sponge of Scotch-Brite, now as of November 2009. I've been noticed the coating starts to peel off. Since I don't want the coating mix with my food, I have to retire this one and get a new one."
2,"OK, but short-lived...","Bought this around two years ago and, like previously mentioned, it has started losing the non-stick. We use it as our ""everyday"" pan and cook lots of curries with it. We always use a Thai Coconut Spoon and never metal on it; it is never put in the dishwasher. The finish isn't peeling, but looks to have essentially broken down on the bottom (almost as if it is burned, but we tend to be pretty careful). We thought it was pretty good at first, but be warned, the finish doesn't hold up. Now we are searching again..."
4,Good wok,"Exactly what I wanted. I didn't realize it'd be so big, but that's my own fault. The product information was very clear."
4,Good stir pan.,It is a big pan and is quite heavy. But with it cooking is easy. It is also easy to clean. My wife really likes it. The only problem is that sometimes I can still see the scratches (not sure if you guys see it).
2,cover does not fit well,"The design and material seem great, but the stir fry and cover do not fit well."
5,Evergreen Tree,"For those who enjoyed the first book ""Where Do I Sleep"" by this author & illustrator team, this second book is a lovely sequel.The artwork is beautiful. The colors are deep as the northwest forest they describe and successfully evoke its atmosphere. The illustrations are more developed than the first book and though not literal in representation, they do illustrate successfully the complexity of the forest ecosystem and give the feeling of being there as the mist rises in the morning.The writing, however, is the main draw to this book. Ms. Blomgren utilizes the same vivid imagery as she did in her first book, ""Where Do I Sleep"", while giving accurate information:'The Indian pipe with its pale ghostly whiteis fed by the tree roots and needs little light'or of the pine-white butterflies:'...they touch downwhere the sweet sun-filled air meets the canopy's crown.'I recommend this book above many of the children's books out there. It is entertaining and informative."
5,Great compilation of lesser-known surf tracks,"I'm by no means an ""expert"" on surf music, but I do like it a lot. I would say this compilation was probably not an attempt to be an exhaustive surf anthology, rather a sampling of some great surf recordings that are not widely known. Certainly a number of surf guitar standards appear here, but often not performed by the band that made them most popular. As another reviewer has commented, there is no Dick Dale, but there are already good Dick Dale anthologies out there. There is also no Ventures, no Trashmen, no Tornadoes, no Challengers, etc., etc.That said, this collection is superb all the way through. As stated in another review, it's an excellent driving disc. Perfect for a breezy summer day, or to brighten a dismal gray day in the dead of winter."
5,Worked as advertised.,The cover explains whats in the whole book. Picasso was so versatile I can't think of any form of art work he didn't master.
4,Its a college technical writing book,It is a fine book for college. I wouldn't necessarily say people should buy it unless your class requires you too. It might be helpful on its own if you really need help figuring out how to write reports and memos i guess.
2,Outdated,The publisher did not update the content for several years even though there were pretty substantial changes in MLA format in 2009 and APA format in 2011. It was much easier to keep selling the same book with outdated documentation models for more money every year. Argh!
5,Great price and very informative content,Bought this book for my ex-girlfriend and it helped her become a better writer in her essay projects for school.
5,F2F's best,"This is the best face to face album, and one of my all time favorite cd's. Its so simple, which is what makes it so good...the guitars are nothing special, the drums pretty basic, the vocals are good, but its how it all fits together that makes this cd so addictive. every song rocks, but my favorite is definitley ""i want"". anyway if you like good ol punk rock, youll dig this album"
5,amazing album,this album is amazing if you like good music this album has it raw and loud and fast with great lyrics...f to f is a great live band too if you have the chance to see them live you have to see them live they are out of this world
5,This is an amazing album,"This album is so cool! I like all the tracks, especially Disconnected, a really good heavy track with an amazing chorus, and No Authority, fast punk at its best. I am gonna buy some more F2F stuff like their self titled album. I would definitely recommend this strong, fast, loud, great album as it really reflects the talent of F2F."
4,Indispensable - Bible of East African-Ismaili Cuisine,"This book is Part II of what I consider the 'bible of East African Ismaili cuisine'. It has some 'Canadian' dishes (and it isn't quite as good as Part I) but it still contains some tried and true favorites, some real classics, and I highly recommend this book as well. I think every Ismaili should have this book. If you love our foods and don't know how to make them, Aunty Noorbanu's book will give you a step-by-step method. This book is amazing. My mother gave me Volume I and II when I left home, and she too has a copy - my whole family refer to this book on a regular basis.I hope you'll get this. Favorites like Kukupaka, Channa Bateta, and others are easily made with Aunty Noorbanu's help!"
3,A mediocre book without a Phd in the sciences,This book had good points and bad points.some of the information contained was applicable for self educated bodybuilders but unfortunately for the most part their was a plethora of technical information that is difficult to comprehend.I have the upmost admiration for mauro di pasquale but i feel this book was written with medical practitioners in mind and not average bodybuilders
2,Wouldn't Recommend It,"Well this product was bought for me several months ago. And from what I understand it was bought because the user reviews were good. Well the EQ is not something to give a CD Player 5 stars for.This CD Player is so unreliable. It plays CDs that it feels like playing. Moreover, because of the slim design, the spinning head every now and then catches onto the case of the player itself, and stops spinning. The shock protection is very bad, and stops playing every other second if I am walking.Moreover, it takes ages for it to load and start playing the song. The FM receiver is not very powerful so one gets static if the CD Player is in a bag.If you are wanting to go walking with your CD Player, this really is not the CD player for you.On another note, it has a good programming and nice colours.Very unreliable."
3,WRONG!,"Best Joseph ever was Sam Harris. Caught him in San Diego, so sad he did not make a CD. I sneaked a tape recorder into the theater but his voice was so powerful on ""Close Every Door"" it literally obliverated the sound on the tape!"
1,Don't buy this CD!!!,"I was very curious when I heard that there was another recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Joseph"". Being one of the cast members of the German production, I love the music and the show a lot. And I also have the whole ""Joseph"" collection of CDs and DVDs at home:-)Now what I was hoping for was a new, ""fresh"" version of Joseph, but this new recording is probably the worst I have ever listened to. I really don't like the voices of Patrick Cassidy and Amy Adams, they are boring and uninspired. Sounds like a poor imitation of the London Revival Cast with Jason Donovan. (I liked Todd DuBail as the Pharaoh though:-))Furthermore the sound quality of the CD was pretty bad.And finally there wasn't any ""Megamix"" at the end (Maybe this new production doesn't have the ""Megamix"" - I haven't seen it) and the finale was shortened and ended with ""Any dream will do"".My advice: Buy the Candian Cast recording of the show. In my opinion that's the best!!!"
3,"Early, un-polished, derivative, but still Buffett","Well, it is clearly Buffett, and if you want to see the growth, you gotta listen to it. But you won't listen to it a lot, just a few times when the really great stuff-cheeseburger, livingston, like that, has been too often on your machine. It's like renting a copy of Rancho Deluxe or Congo, so you can see him on screen, but it ain't his best..."
1,This album is almost unnecessary,I am afraid someone not familar with Jimmy's music may buy this album and think it is representative of his work and then miss all his great music. Get the good stuff first then buy this if you must complete your Buffett collection
2,Well-written outdated book for beginners,"I bought this book; it is a well-written introduction for home-networking for a beginner.Unfortunately it is very dated: It specifically deals with Windows 95 and 98. Since that time, there have been several versions of Windows 98, Windows ME, multiple versions of Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista. If you need help on a current product, this book is NOT for you."
3,Excellent for review or further self study.,"This text was recommended to me for further independent study after two years of high school Latin (using the Ecce Romani series). For that purpose, it is excellent, but it would probably be rather hard going for one truly starting from the beginning. The boldface type (of which there is a great deal) is rather blurred and difficult to read--on occasion one has to guess at a letter; and the binding on my copy began to fall apart by the time I was only a quarter of the way through the book. The reading selections are outstanding. I consider the purchase price money well spent."
3,Addendum to previous review,"When I E-mailed to the publisher to comment on the binding and boldface print quality, they promptly sent me another copy at no charge. In fact, the print IS a bit more readable than in my first copy. I have high hopes for the binding, and it is a pleasure finding a business that goes the extra mile."
1,There's a reason this book is out of print.,"Poorly organized, uses patterns, grammar and vocab without the benefit of introduction or explanation. Frustrating for a self-taught student. Many books on the market (Wheelock's) that do a vastly superior job. Very disappointing."
2,Was Ok.,"I was rather disapoointed with the way this book tried to to teach the language. If you are thinking about this book, I would recommend using Wheelock's Latin 6th edition."
5,La inolvidable Gilda,"Wonderful book , beautiful pictures of a movie queen, great experience the book will teach you many thing about the inolvidable GILDA"
5,Intense Imagery and humorous sketchings,"Another great novel by the master of Beat. In this book Kerouac takes us thru the town of Lowell, centering around Christ-like pneuma Sax as his tutelary spirit. Many biblical symbols often appear, somehow transforming the novel to holy scriptures. When reading Dr. Sax I discover that writing can be comical and at the same time perceptive. A must read."
5,I'm In This Book,"On pp 130-132, I can see myself in Audrey's superbly timed photograph, as well as read my own prattle. It was initially an ego-trip to be published, to see my marriage documented in such a refined way. But, the truth of this collection is that it has integrity. Audrey wanted to elucidate something common between disparate couples (some of whom had married multiple times, and some who are divorced now). I think she succeeded beautifully. Her nuanced pictures are wonderful, but accompany even more illuminating discussions from a great wide swath of our culture."
4,Nice,"I wasn't expecting this book to be as interesting as it is. I was expecting it to repeat some old cliches on marriage, but it was not like this at all. The subjects appearing were not stereotypical and their comments were insightful and fun reading. The photographs are beautifully done--the whole book is a nice idea. And...original!"
5,Excellent Overview,"With beautiful photography and informative interviews, this video is a wonderful introduction to the tropical forest. The video focuses on Barro Colorado Island and features information about monkeys, bats, frogs, plants, and a few small mammals. Interviews with international researchers make this a lively video."
4,Basic but fun,An old fashioned book with a variety of projects. We have not made any yet which will be the true test for the instructions. There are lots of choices of projects that should keep us busy.
3,this needs a knowledgeable adult around,"With a knowledgeable adult around, though, it can be very good for kids so just take that into account, please."
3,A Review from South Africa,This little book looks good so far although we'll still have to saee how the kids cope on their own & if they'll be able to successfully plan each project - unfortunately it's all in inches & feet & I'm not keen to teach my kids all that stuff so we are going to have to do conversions.I feel this could have been highlighted prior to purchase.
5,Ideal Hand Soap,"This liquid soap is ideal for anyone wishing to have the protection of an antibacterial ingredient yet have soap that is gentle, mild, and nicely scented. Great for everyday use because it is so mild. We keep it in our built-in soap dispenser by the kitchen sink so the evryone can experience this fabulous product."
3,They look great but...,"I have a narrow foot and even so, the small strap weaves through the shoe right near my small toe and the inner ball of my foot which caused discomfort before even walking in them. As far as looks and quality, they are nice but not too comfy."
4,Funny Stuff,I have seen alot of anime and this one I have to say ranks in the top ten of the comedy section. If you like sexual inuendos and good old dirty humor then this is one for you.
5,Thumbs up from me.,"I had never heard of Desert Punk before seeing it here and reading the reviews. I don't regret this purchase at all. Its kind of childish , but definitely not for kids. The humor catches you off guard and sometimes I'm like ""Did they really say that"". So if you want a 6 disc set thats not too much more than a new release movie , then buy this set. You get several hours of viewing , a collectors tin and cool art. A win in my book."
5,p.s.: your mother is a dirty whore......,"when I was recommended this series from a friend. I dodnt know what to exspect. but I must say it was highly enjoyable. the characters were well written, the action scenes kicked ass, and it had one of the most interesting plot twists out there. If ya like post apocolyptic series like Trigun, this is your bag."
4,"Dirty minded, if a little average","To be frank, the main character is a cynical, manipulative, depraved, black-hearted pervert. His only positive features are his tenacity and dedication to work. Besides that he is a pretty wicked person. Desert Punk is simply a raunchy misadventure in the desert. Nothing more and nothing less. Its pretty offensive, but quality wise it could have been much worse. Know what your getting into before buying this series."
5,Funnies damn anime in recent memory,"I can't remember the last time I've laughed at an anime so much. FUNimation did a fantastic job dubbing this in English, with a very mature, crud, and witty dialog. This was a very pleasant surprise. I'd recommend it to anyone, not just anime fans. This may now be my favorite anime."
4,Cute,"First off, this is NOT for a 36 month old. It has super tiny pieces with it that I could barely see when taking them out of the box. It is cute, and I like the way it opens and closes. It does only include one girl though."
4,Not Bad,"This is a nice toy in some ways. My granddaughter enjoyed exploring all the neat places to put things and all the stuff that it does. It folds up easily to carry it along with you. The only problem is that all the accessories are so tiny, they become easily lost."
1,Very bad radio,"It will not stay on a station. It is a very poor radio, do not buy one. It takes 30 minutes to start playing at times and then it goes to static and will not stay on a station. Forget about Circuit City replying to your request about the radio defects. I will not purchase anything else from Circuit City. I emailed them two times, even though they promise a 24 hour turn around reply and wrote them once with no reply. I sent it back to the company yesterday and asked for my money back since I have purchased a better one from Best Buy. Thanks."
5,"for somewhat advanced beginner, on opening play","Well written introduction to opening moves in the corners for players who have progresed beyond the earliest beginner stage. If you are beginning to have a little feeling for the game instead of feeling totally confused, this is a book for you. These opening sequences give an even result locally. The authors (a Japanese and an American professional) discuss how each opening sequence interacts with other areas of the board."
5,glorious,"I like this cd . It's very powerful lyric's convey what we all need to hear these days. This cd is a good mix of hip/hop rap and r/b. My favorite song is ""BEING GUIDED BY GOD"",but i like the whole cd. Good stuff."
4,"Great read for history, but information is slightly dated.","This was a great book to learn a lot of the history about Combat Control Techs. and Para Rescue men. Very good information about some of the operations these men conducted and participated in, and how they became to be what they are today. The only problem I could find with the book itself was that much of the PAST and entrance information is different today than when printed, but can easily be found at an recruiters office or on the internet."
5,Suzy does her homework .,"Suzy Gershman is one of the only writers of series travel guides who actually earns her percentage of each book, in my opinion. Her shopping series is actually significantly updated from year to year, and therefore, is one of the only ones worth buying repeatedly. I have frequently been astonished that many other brandname guides are essentially reprints of the version for the previous year with little to no update. Why buy them? I've always gotten great tips from Suzy and I appreciate her hard work and wonderful sense of humor. When travel time is limited, it's nice to have Suzy to have done the advance footwork. Keep it up, Suzy! You keep researching and your readers will try to continue to create opportunities to use your shopping advice!"
3,"Great musicians, and a voice like a cat on the back fence at night.","This is a fine collection of songs, and the musicians perform them well. The lead singer (Terry, I suppose) isn't as bad as he sounds."
3,Freshwater Rays (Aqualog-reference books,Needs to be updated. Some labels are not correct. German/English combination is confusing. should be published either just English or German
4,"It's Good, but could be better!","This book is very good for research on poets, like Sylvia Plath. The book is able to give you some insight into the poets life."
3,Not what I expected,"After hearing Ulrich's work on early Scorpions albums, I was excited to hear what he would do on his own. Well, It really sounds nothing like the rock n roll on Scorpions. I suppose, if you like progressive rock you'll like it. For example, the song 'Lilac' and 'Japanese dream' are supposed to be these vivid ""paintings in sound"" that evoke pictures of gardens ect. I don't know call me crazy, I just wanted them to rock.Anywho, If you liked what Scorpions were doing in the mid-late seventies ie Sails of Charon and you find yourself wanting to hear more........Just push the repeat button on your player because you will not find it here."
5,This auger rocks !,"I bought this last year for ice fishing here in NH white mountains. It has performed flawlessly. The charge lasts for full day - able to drill holes for myself and 3, 4, or 5 friends including Cusk holes (6 holes per person). No gas, propane, no cleaning of carb at end of season, no pulling of cord in freezing temps... flip a switch and quietly drill away. I sold my jiffy 10"" gas for this after making sure it worked great. Zero regrets so far."
2,wont last,"I loved the TK waistband when i first got it, but after about 4 months the velcro started pulling away and it wouldnt stick anymore. A much cheaper one i had before lasted over a year.Its possibe I just got a lemon , i dont know .But i do love the TK knee supports .. As for the waistband, if your going to wear it alot, i say save your money."
2,Good product - Deceptive Description,This is a fairly good quality product but the sizing information is completely wrong. It is advertised as fitting up to a 60 inch waist but it absolutely will not. The belt is 42 inches long and may stretch up to a 50 inch waist at best which would be seriuosly uncomfortable.
4,The truth about THE TRUTH,"I found this book to be revealing about the series hidden information. My sister and I had always suspected whom Varina-one of the characters-was cloned from. As it turned out, we were right! It also says what happened to Starr and Professor James Fergus, who I believe are important characters. Although, it held to much importance on the hope you would have read the first two books-like why the bad guy's in jail, and other details. I would recommend all three books."
5,The truth can hurt,"Allison has enjoying life as much as a clone can until she meets the woman she was cloned from, a beautiful model. Allison is overjoyed to meet Cressida Ray and is debating whether or not to tell Cressida the truth about being her clone. But she learns that someone is trying to keep her quiet and will go to extreme measures to do so. While Allison is trying to escape death, her friends have discovered information about Dr. Jessica Hart, one of the doctors who helped them escaped. This series is really good and I would recommend it to anyone because I'm positive anyone would enjoy because it keeps you want to reading until the end."
4,"Great bubbled, needs weight to hold it down","This is a great bubbler that aerates the water terrifically, but it's hard to keep down. I've put it under the small rocks and it comes free in a couple of days, so now I put a heavy rock on it's air tube, or a bury it under a heavy aquarium decoration with holes in it. Either one works fine, but it's tricky to set up."
4,Works just needs some weights,I am using several of these for my Aquaponics garden 300 Gallon fish tank. I just have them laying over the side of the tank on the bottom about 4 feet deep. The amount of air seems to be just what I needed for my size tank any the 45 Lph air pump. Only drawback is they do in fact float on the one side. This isn't really a problem for a tank like mine but I can see it being a problem for a home aquarium unless you weigh it down. I noticed there is a spot on the back about the size of a dime that you could actually put in a couple of fishing weights in and then seal it with silicone over the top. That should keep it down and I might do that if it later causes a problem.
3,Not as pictured,I was not very happy when I received my bubble pads. The picture shows black plastic with the bubble disc inside as blue/green. I received bright turquoise plastic which does not at all blend in with my Tahitian black moon sand. Bubbles well otherwise.
1,Worthless,Unfortunately like others mentioned this thing is so light and cheap it just floats around in your tank making it useless for most applications.
1,Disappointing.,"Bubbles are only coming out of a small 1/2 inch portion on the edge of the ring, thought it maybe would increase in time but it has not."
1,Doesn't aerate worth a darn,All I got out of this lousy product were huge bubbles out of three locations on this piece of junk. Whatever happened to a mist of bubbles like I wanted. I bought a much cheaper airstone that really delivered the goods. I'm just going to keep this bubble disk as an emergency ornament (if that means anything). I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
5,great bubbles,Was looking for something to go in my tank and fill it with bubbles. I put this in a six gallon round tank. It works wonderful. It sits under the decorations and fills them with bubbles (which all come out a hole in the roof of the building in the bottom). This is a great way to get some bubbles in your tank.
2,Not What I Expected,"I bough this to put in my 55 gallon tank, and as soon as I put it in, it floated right back to the top. I did everything to try to keep it down. I put lots of gravel over it, rocks, anything I could find to try to get this thing to stay at the bottom of the tank. Nothing worked! Would not recommend this at all unless you don't mind it floating around in your tank."
2,"makes bubbles, but not as many as wand styles","I bough this and a 4in standard air stone. The 4in stone produces twice as many bubbles on the same exact air pump (wisper 100g). The bubbles were not any smaller than the 4in stone. Save yourself the cash and get a normal airstone, this disk is a paper weight."
3,Not Too Bad,"I bought this a while back and it wasnt too bad, some parts of its surface were clogged and it really disrupted the water, but other than that it worked fine."
2,"Good bubbles, but","I put it in my fish tank and it has great bubbles (so far). My problem is, that it will not stay on the floor of the tank. I have tried weighing it down using extra connection tubing and gravel, but it still wants to float. I also tried reducing the air flow to almost nothing, but that did not work either. I ended up wedging it behind a large intake tube to keep it from floating to the top of the tank. I like the bubbles but, I don't like the fact that it will not stay on the bottom gravel bed."
1,Nice Bubbles but Floats Like Crazy,"Unlike the photo on the package that shows the disk laying nicely on the tank bottom, mine kept floating up. Even if I buried the line in stones it went up. Finally I put a big rock on top of it, the rock had a hole thru it and the bubbles now come up thru the rock. Actually a very cool look.Not well designed as it keeps floating up but it does bubble nicely.One week later, I ended up replacing this with a regular bubble tube that attaches to the wall of my tank because no matter WHAT I did to hold this down (put it under a rock,bury it in gravel, etc) it eventually would break free and float up. Don't buy it."
1,Faulty,"The weels came off after they were tightend very strongly, tilting the cart and sending all our china plates crashing down. Very unhappy"
4,not the best bang for the buck,Bought these because they had been advertised as a very high quality product and was tired of paying $5 a piece at my local gardening place. Got them in and the middle of the pile was ridden with edge wood pieces that still had the bark on them even! Go to your local store so you can pick out your stakes and get the best quality.
5,"A MUST read for EVERYONE, not just leaders","Although it's called The LEADER'S Edge, a more appropriate title might be The PERSON'S Edge, as I think it's a must read for EVERYONE over the age of 18. It's a wonderfully easy-to-understand and deeply thought-provoking book about how we show up to the world (which is often quite different than how we think the world sees us) and how, through heightened self-awareness and feedback, we can enhance our personal brand in everyday situations - professional and personal. I've recommended this book to everyone from the leader of a 600+ person practice to administrative personnel, and the reactions have been equally positive and powerful. I can't wait for my children to be old enough to read it themselves. I truly believe the world would operate more effectively if we all invested the time to read this book."
3,A well structured book but lacking test essentials,"I agree with the rest of the reviewers, specifically regarding the abundance of typos! However, I would recommend any person who wants to pass the 070-59 test to add another book on the same subject to their preparation list. Still, it is possible that a specific test subject will be overlooked by both books..."
2,"PREDICTABLE, BUT ENDS BETTER THAN IT BEGINS! 2 1/4 STARS!","I'm a big fan of horror films, but there hasn't been much to get excited about lately. This film had some potential, but cardboard characters and a flimsy script kept it from being anything but a routine slasher. The idea is pretty good, kind of like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' meets 'Last Action Hero', but it just doesn't deliver many chills. The last quarter of the film is better than the first three quarters, but it doesn't save this from being a ""by the numbers"" horror flick. The acting is decent for this type of film and the killer is pretty cool looking, but the killings are pretty mild for a slasher. It's worth a look for fans of slasher films, but it's pretty forgettable."
3,Maybe they should have gone to Rocky Horror instead...,"I'd heard about this by mistake when I was searching for the documentaryMidnight Movies. I tried it because the cover was very well done. I wound up liking it.A group of people are trapped in a theater when the killer from a midnight movie (that *strongly* resemblesThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre) enters 'the real world'.A movie that had a very small budget and stars people you've never heard of, but for what they had, it was well done. I'm rating it three stars. I may be overselling it here. I think it's just that I expected *nothing*, so my liking it was a pleasant surprise.I think it would make a good double feature with another 'trapped in the theater' horror movie:Popcorn"
4,A Decent Little Slasher Film!!!,"I heard about this film about a year ago, and I happened to see it a few hours ago at Walmart, so I decided to buy it! It has a really cool looking killer, and a perfect slasher film! A random group of people come to see a midnight screening of a classic horror film. While they watch the movie, they see their friends dying and come to understand that the killer in the film can break into reality whenever he chooses to. All the doors and windows are locked, and the group try to escape from the old theater if they wanna make it out alive. I highly recommend MIDNIGHT MOVIE!!!"
2,Trash.,"This movie reminded me of something that I watched when I was a kid in the 80s on late night HBO. I would not recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 18 who is a horror movie enthusiast. I was expecting much more from this movie after reading the reviews on the standard DVD, but was completely let down. The one good thing I can say about the blu-ray version of this film is the sound and picture quality are extremely crisp, but unfortunately the concept, acting, and storyline were not. I realize it is a low budget film, but does that mean the dialogue and concepts have to be ""low budget"" as well? EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and DEFINITELY NOT SCARY!!!!!!! Gave 2 stars for picture and sound quality on blu-ray version, but the movie is t-r-a-s-h."
3,If you want to kill some time.,This could have been a classic given a few extra minutes of film and a few better writers. It's a way to kill some time if your bored but will tick you off because of the lack of dialog and general story / background. It was left with a room for a sequal but hopefully no room for the original writers.
2,Dumb,"This is one of the worst horror flicks I've seen in years. I really had hopes, given the generally positive reviews. Avoid this movie!"
1,Not My Favorite of the Summer,"I've been seeing a lot of films lately. One of which was Midnight Movie, which didn't really seem very new or novel. While I'm not a very big fan of horror films, to me the film didn't seem very fresh. The killer was this demon with supernatural powers, sure he was scary but I didn't much care for the gore. At times the film felt claustrophobic and trapping, which I really didn't like. The music was really eerie and the louder it got behind the gruesome deaths the more it turned me off. It might be worthwhile to watch ""The Killer Cut"" to see if it was improved or what add ons the DVD has to offer, but for now that's my opinion."
4,awesome,"Just saw Midnight Movie and really liked it. It had a cool premise that referenced back to classic, old horror movies like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which I loved. There's also this cool movie-in-a-movie aspect that brings it back to the present really well. I'm not a big fan of too much gore, but this was the perfect amount for me--it didn't fall back on it like some thrillers do. If you're already a fan of the original Midnight Movie, for the Killer Cut they include even more scenes, some of them re-done, and the quality of the special effects is awesome. Overall, really exciting and super freaky--a new favorite, for sure!"
3,"Hmmm... The ""Killer"" Cut","Ok, i'm going to start out by saying that I own BOTH of the Midnight movie films, the original and the ""Killer Cut."" I have not yet SEEN the Killer Cut version of the movie. What's funny and VERY disappointing is that from looking at the back covers of BOTH of these DVD's, they BOTH have the same running time of 82 mins.!!! So one has to wonder as to what exactly contributes to ""Cut"" version if it's as long as the original. As for the ""Bonus Features"" of this movie, the ""Deleted Scenes"" are ALSO the same, NOTHING NEW!!! What's even MORE confusing (And/or disappointing) is that the 2008 (original) version is NOT RATED while the ""Killer Cut"" one IS with an ""R"" rating!!! So I can't tell anybody for sure if it's even worth buying the Killer Cut version if you already own the original."
3,Very cool premise,"Okay, I admit it, this was pretty cool. Would have been worth 4 stars if the acting was better and the killer wasn't so stuck in a rut. You know how it goes. This killer has a machette, this one steel claws, this one ... well let's just say it's dumb.Still the film plays with space and time and existence, life, I guess, as we know it. Are the murdered still with us to be tortured again? Maybe. Can a film character, a killer, come off the screen? Maybe. All I know is a group of people are trapped in a theater and they die ... or do they, really?"
3,Pretty Good New Killer,"I really liked this movie. It had a new fresh premise. Always a fan of the limited cast , with limited scenery, being stalked by a maniac. Since most horror movies are copycats, this was refreshing. I can conceive of this serial killer being the Jason for a new generation, even though this movie was not Friday the 13th. How creative for a superkiller to fluctuate between the movie and real life. Wish the character who got electrocuted had been beaten up a while after what he did to his girlfriend. His was the only character that made me want to root for the killer, who looked authentic. Would recommend to any horror fan.Must watch all to understand, but definitely worth the viewing. Like how the movie lets us get to know and relate to each character. Basically everyone is running from the killer throughout most of the movie. But it is well worth the race. Wish the boyfriend had survived. At least the killer did to chase more youngins throughout another theater in the sequel."
2,Ugh!,The only thing good about the film was that it was presented in Blu ray. Glad I brought it used!
3,Not too bad,"Compared to the garbage put out by Asylum, this movie is ""Gone With The Wind""! For a low budget film this isn't too bad, if you're a fan of ""Behind the Mask - The Rise of Leslie Vernon"" from 2006, you'll like this film."
4,Beware: Sizing on these sandals runs BIG,"I purchased a pair of these sandals, as I'd had a pair of Speedo massage slides in the past (purchased from Costco). I ordered a size 6, which was the size of similar Speedo massage sandals I'd bought at Costco a few years ago (and wore to death), but found my foot was swimming in those ordered from Amazon. At first glance, I thought the wrong size (or a men's size 6) had been delivered. Besides being long, they also seem to be for Very Wide feet.In any event, they don't fit, even moving the velcro tab and, much to my chagrin, I'm returning them. You might want to try on a pair in a shop before purchasing these."
3,Ten-Speed performing at a slower speed,"This was a pretty good book I must admit but it wasn't as fulfilling as some of the other books from the Sweet Dreams Series.Ten-Speed summer was about a girl named Rhonda on a bike tour of the Southwest. She meets a wonderful guy that has her thinking of romance abroad other than romance with her current love of 3 years.Although it was a pretty good book I rated it only 3 stars because I felt that the book seemed to jump to the next chapter a little too fast and the things I wanted to know about...like what happened at the end between her boyfriend and her, well that part was lacking. All and all the book was good but I felt it needed at least 1 more chapter."
3,A fairly good book.,When I read this book I was slightly disappionted. Basically I agree with the other review above.
5,I am a real fan of the Three Tenors and consider this collection a coup to add it for this Christmas,The Three Tenors songs for Christmas CD perfect for the season and was in perfect condition. It played cleanly on both my CD player and in my car. I have it on my MP3 where the songs shuffle in at odd moments cto cheer me up.Packaging was well done and arrived on time.AAAAA+++++ seller and music CD.
1,The Three Tenors christmas cd,I was very dissapointed and wish I had returned the CD but since it wasopened & used I was unable to
2,The Title Cut is Worth the Price of the CD,"Back in the sixties I had some college buddies who shared good jazz recordings with me. One such album was Angel Eyes. Gene Ammons lyrical and melodic saxaphone solos struck a chord with me and the title cut Angel Eyes conjures up haunting back ally scenes of beat despair and longing. In fact I heard this song in the early 70's in a New Orleans bar late at night and it soothed a worn out soul. The rest of the CD comes across as standard run of the mill jazz, tame when compared to the heights set by Miles, Roland Kirk, Coltrane and others of the time. But if you want that late night starry starry night feeling-""Angel Eyes"" is worth the price of the CD."
5,HOLLY BARKER BOOK FOUR,"or is it Book One...new Holly Barker? I am surprised that there aren't more good reviews. I thought this was a good Barker yarn. A good beach read. New perhaps because she is changing jobs and locations for the story. One reviewer I read was not pleased with character development, well, ok, but it's almost like reading book one of series. Hey Teddy Fay is one great villian, and we get President Lee, even a brief Stone Barrington. The book is good. RECOMMENDED, on the book five."
4,Stuart Woods Offers An Entertaining Spy Thriller,"The book starts off really well as two military jets pursue Teddy Fay in a prop plane over the beaches of Maine. That level of excitement, however, drops a bit as we follow Holly Barker through her training that involves some interesting conflicts and mishaps and Teddy Fay through his preparations. At least early on one wonders whether Fay is arch villain or arch hero although clues quickly tip the scales. The book is a quick, fun read with a few interesting insights placed here and there.The Griffon Trilogy (Pt. I)"
4,"Hey, I liked it!","I don't know what everyone is complaining about, I enjoyed the book. True, I haven't read ""Capital Crimes"" yet, so I didn't have Teddy Faye's back history, but I was still able to come into the story and enjoy his character. The plotting was a bit slower than usual, but I enjoyed the paranoid atmosphere at the Farm while Holly was training with the CIA. I actually got rather a kick out of all the ""bumping into each other"" that Holly and Teddy did without Holly ever realizing it, or realizing it too late, and I was absolutely delighted with the ending . . . because deep down inside, that's just the kind of person I am. I sped through this book in no time - it's an easy read and a fun book - great for lying in the sun and spending a lazy afternoon. Not every book has to be bang-bang shoot-em-up every second - sometimes it is nice to read something fun like this. Keep 'em coming, Mr. Woods!"
2,Too Silly to Take Seriously,"I completely agree with the prior reviewer -- this book was way too silly to be taken seriously. I've read some of Stuart Woods' earlier work, which was VERY well written and believable. This book was decently written (I finished it) but had so many ridiculous plot developments that I can't recommend it.My advice is to skip this book unless you're looking for pure escapism."
2,Tedious,"Is this self-engrossed pompous writer being paid by the word. This was overly long, seeming the author was more impressed by his faux knowledge of the governments possible covert activities then by an interesting, enticing, exciting story line. I don't really care what Mr. Wood's political bent is, but I don't care to be ""hit over the head"" with his biases. I was seeking a fictional, entertaining thriller, a read by the fire in these chilly fall days. Not a long and drawn out, longwinded psuedo-factual diatribe about our nasty government operations. The only fun part was Mr. Fay's exploits and the detail in which they were carried out."
2,Will Teddy Fay get away,"The only interesting thing about this book is whether Teddy Fay, the bad guy, will fool the stumble-bums from the CIA and the FBI who are chasing him. The best one can do about the ""main"" characters, Holly Barker and friends, relatives, and associates is skim read whenever they appear. Not even the dog is interesting. I expect that Woods has begun to outsource the writing of his books."
3,Holly Barker's Back!!,"Typically I read mystery and scifi. This isn't my favorite of Stuart Woods Holly Barker novels, but it is an okay book nonetheless. For anyone starting out reading Woods, this isn't a good place to start. Go back to his earliest novels."
3,Not a Home Run ... Maybe a Double ...,"As a Stuart Woods fan for many years, I always look forward to his new books. Unfortunately, this book was somewhat disappointing. The story is nowhere near as interesting as some of his previous books and not in the same league as The Prince of Beverly Hills, for example. The characters are familiar, the story 'arcs' are interesting but predictable and, in some cases, seem incomplete.The most frustrating part of this book is that it seems to serve only one purpose - to serve as some sort of bridge to another book.That said, I'll still continue to buy and read his books. Hopefully, he'll surprise us and break into some new territory in the future."
1,This book don't deserve 1 star!!!,"This is my first and last Stuart Woods novel. Fortunate for me, I checked this book on CD out at the library, so it didn't cost me anything. The characters were so lame. No one gets what they deserve in this book. I hated that stupid dog Holly had to take everywhere with her. She seemed like a dumb blond and she, with the exception of Teddy Fay, was the smartest character in the book. This book deserves a NEGATIVE three star rating. The only book this bad in my memory is Patricia Cornwell's Isle of Dogs. That book was far worse. All the characters were unrealistic. If our real FBI and CIA are this inept, this country is in real trouble. If you're thinking about reading this book, don't, it's a waste of time. Go get yourself a Vince Flynn novel. He knows how to write."
1,absolutely awful ending,"I liked the character Holly, and the dialogue was interesting, but after waiting for a reasonable ending it was a huge disappointment. Since this was my first Woods book, I will give him (maybe) another shot, but this was extremely disappointing after spending a reasonable amount of time reading a 'chase' book, you would like a far better conculsion."
2,"Flat, flat, flat","This book was passed along to me by a friend and is my introduction to the Stuart Woods collection. I thought an author with more than 20 books to his credit ought to be a good read. The plot line, a serial killer that targets terrorists in the U.S. with diplomatic immunity, had potential for philosophical debate. However, I am very disappointed. The characters are two-dimensional. The dialogue is dull. The plot is shallow.If you haven't read this book yet, you haven't missed much."
2,"Not up to ""par""","BIG YAWN! I gave it ""2 starts"" because it is after all a ""Holly Barker"" novel and Stone Barrington did drop in for a few pages. As for the rest of the book.......it was pretty boring. It got to the point where I wanted the bad guy to get away with it.Holly goes ""CIA"" and is instantly at the top of her class and leading more seasoned agents on the hunt for a killer. No ramp up time for her...........I thought by the end of the book she'd be the new director. I really like her character and the author didn't do her any favors by not letting her feel her way around, make mistakes and learn from others who have been in the game longer."
3,Not as light as I thought it would be,"From other reviews, I thought this would be extremely lightweight. Turns out that w/ the full size plug and cord, it's really no lighter than my normal dryer (which, to be fair, is a compact dryer). This seems like it will do a perfectly adequate job as a hair dryer, but I like to pack LIGHT, and this is a little bit bigger/heavier than I thought it would be. Still, for so little money, I will keep it."
4,performed well,This is a small but powerful hair dryer. Mine arrived slightly cracked so I was not sure if it would work. After trying it out I found it does work rather unexpectedly well. It is light weight that would be handy for travelling. The material does look cheap and filmsy. But as long as it works that's good enough.
4,Super Little Travel Dryer,This does the business with minimum demand for luggage space and perfectly adequate for maintaining an adult and professional appearance. Why spend more?
3,Too foolproof,"Lightweight, reasonably priced, and well designed except for one unfortunate feature: when set for 125 volts it cannot be run on high power, presumably to prevent blowing it out on this setting when plugged into a 250 volt outlet. It works better set for 250 volts and high power in a 125 volt outlet than it does set for 125 and low power, but it isn't very powerful either way. Works great for European travel but not so well in this hemisphere."
4,Good for this price,Good for this price. I recommend this item who wants to get a usable little dryer for a small amount of money.
3,Light and folds neatly.,"Bought this when my hair dryer finally gave up after about 15 years of use. Since I like to travel, the dual voltage is a nice feature. Unfortunately it is not obvious which way to turn the switch to change voltage and the instructions don't mention it, so you have to try it out to see. Once that's solved, however, the hot setting is quite strong and should make short work of drying even long hair. It's worth the price paid, packs up small, and ought to do the job. No attachments, just a very basic hair dryer with two speeds."
4,Its Handy!!!,Its really small and handy..Its just the size to carry anywhere but the wire is too long thats the only drawback. Still you can go for this and the price suits. The colour is cute.
4,Nice Little Dryer,"Purchased this hair dryer a short while ago and, thus far, it has worked very well for my needs. It's very small and compact, making it perfect for travel or just tucking it in a drawer out of the way and the dual speeds is a nice feature. It is not the most powerful hair dryer out there by any regard but I have quite short hair and, for this, it works perfectly.If you have long, thick hair, I would recommend looking for a more powerful dryer.So far, so good; very happy with the product."
4,"Small, convenient and inexpensive","When I was a kid I owned a number of different hairdryers that were all bigger, stronger and more expensive (comparatively) than this one. But as a (grown-up)man this one suits my needs. I admit it is the first hairdryer I have owned in about 15 years, but serves to save me from the old wet hair in winter - get a cold with ease connection.If you have hair you can put in a ponytail, look for another hairdryer."
4,It works!,"I don't use this dryer very often and usually only use it for a few minutes. I use both the high and low settings and am very careful with storing it and plugging and unplugging it.It is very inexpensive and so it needs to be treated carefully and not overtaxed with running it for long periods of time on high. It is not for heavy duty use, and that is obvious when you look at the quality of the plastic that it is made of. And it is small, which means it has a little motor that can't do much and is prone to overheating.But if you just want to use it for a few minutes, to get short hair damp dry it is just fine."
4,great travel dryer,this is a great little dryer. does what its supposed to do and for the price is perfect for occasional use!
3,Miley is only on it for about 6 min,I didn't expect her to much so it was really cool seeing the backstage stuff.Amazon Can u get these Burn on DemandOprah Sex & The City Reunion may 2009Oprah Sex & The City Say GoodbyeGMADec 2nd Full Show with Britney Spears performing Circus & Womanizer and having her birthday cake.
2,Not what i wanted,this isn't what i wanted. i wanted it to be like a book where you plan a sleepover. but is actually like a diary about your sleepover that you and your friends fill out.
5,Great,A hilarious addition to my Killer Bunnies collection. I plan on eventually getting all the expansions.Four more words required.
4,Excellent,"I purchased this weapon and it is great. It fires about 200fps and is accurate to about 40 Feet. It is a great starter weapon for anyone new to airsoft. It occaisionally is unaccurate, but a great pistol overall"
5,i love it!,i bought this gun not expecting muchbut its a really good backupbackup gunhahait gives a good sting from about 15 feet
5,***It Rocks!***,"The most SKA-like of Voodoo's albums. This is one of my favorite albums of all time! If you like fast, loud, and horns...BUY IT! Nothin' better..."
4,where's Brodie?,"this CD was actually better than i expected. it's from back when they were on the old Dr. Strange label, and feels a lot more raw than their Epitaph recordings.this CD has some great songs like Dogpile and Too Many Secrets, but a couple songs (like Mother & Son) suck. also, Brodie Johnson, the trombone player, isn't with the band and they got some guy named Don playing another trumpet. a great CD, but buy Firme first."
2,slow ska-core,"I was really disappointed with this cd. I had heard good things, but after listening to it a few times, I finally had to accept that it just wasn't very good. THe Voodoo Glow-Skulls play dark, slow ska-core with a Mexican feel. It is just about as far from traditional ska as you can get, which I wouldn't mind, except the punk aspect of the music is pretty terrible as well. You might like this if you're looking for something different, or are sick of the recent light-hearted ska/punk trend."
2,LaCie Drive can't play Toast recorded DVD's on G4 MACs,"Somewhat disappointed in product. I have a power MAC G4 running Apple OSX 10.4, and the LaCie DVD drive won't play DVD's on the computer. I bought it partly to play DVD's, but the Apple website that LaCie recommended to download a program from Apple that would allow DVD's to play was shut down - permanently. No downloadable programs that would allow the LaCie drive to play DVD's I recorded on a MAC G4 Quicksilver are known to me to be available.Jan Reed"
4,Almost excellent,"The burner is solidly built. I wish it is a bit shorter. I am using it with my mini-mac(power pc). one slight problem is during a 2 drives copy setup. mini-mac to read, and Lacie to write, some errors showed up and aborted the operation. I supposed the reading drive is slower and hence causing the problem. Other than that, as both read and write drive, the Lacie showed no problem at all."
2,Worked but is now dead.,"I got this as a birthday present a couple of years back. The drive worked well for the time it was in service. Never had media to use the lightscribe. Recently the drive just died. Customer service at LaCie is via posting questions/responses on their website. This took about 2 weeks to determine there was nothing I could do. They were helpful but not useful and I was disappointed by their lack of support. The final result was that they refused to consider fixing the drive after the warranty period was up (their policy). Now it's trash and I'm shopping for a replacement.What it comes down to is, if you like the drive, get it. As I stated the drive worked well in its time. Know, however, that once the year warranty is over you are on you're own. If it fails, it's a housing for parts or a book end."
4,Illini Remote,Purchased this for my son who is a big Illini fan. It will be a big hit for Christmas!
5,Like an old favorit t-shirt,"This book is about a period of time between love affairs in a lesbian's life. It was funny, witty, just one of those books that you feel comfortable reading and is easy to indentify with. If you need a book to take your mind off of things and just lay back and relax, that's the book."
3,Reel Funny,"This book follows the misadventures of Laney Tuttle as her girlfriend dumps her, she finds a new place to live, her new roommates try to set her up on blind dates, she falls for a mystery woman, and the movie theater where she works closes for good. The story is well-written and parts of it are very funny. However, at almost 350 pages, the book itself is long winded and boring. I gave it 3 stars because of the author's wit and humor, not her story-telling ability.Recommended for reading on a long trip, accompanied with a large pop and a bag of microwave popcorn."
3,Not a cat's favorite treat,"I'm not really sure what to think of these treats. Cats seems to only want to eat them sometimes. I have given them to three different cats, and each cat has loved them at first and then grown tired of them. I have a feeling that my cats prefer crunchy treats to these moist ones.These treats also have a sour, cheesy smell to them, unlike crunchy treats, which generally just smell like kibbles."
3,Do not buy this product!,"IMPORTANT NEWS: The managers of the Auto Assault MMO have _closed_ the game; this, no-one can play it anymore.While AA was a fun and enjoyable MMO, it never gained a large enough player-base to sustain itself financially. In June of 2007, PlayNC announced that the single remaining server would be shut down; at this time, they stopped charging for playtime, stopped accepting re-subscription requests, and stopped allowing the creation of new accounts.The servers were officially taken off-line on August 31, 2007.Sorry, folks. The lights are out, the music's stopped playing, and even the janitor has already left the building."
2,Had promise but disappointed in the end,"I've been playing AA since beta and I've seen it grow in unique ways but unfortunately, the game is still plagued by numerous bugs and requires some serious tinkering. In the one day since the game went live, I re-recorded over 80 issues that any player will encounter in the game. This issues plus hundreds more have been given to the dev team many times but they are haven't given us the slightest sign that they are aware of the issues or are going to address them.Like other players that I've talked to, they are also disappointed with the performance of the game and the frequent lag that you'll experience while driving and especially in any town. I will continue to play the game for the first month as it's free but after that, if there's no improvement then my friends and I are leaving."
4,EYE CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW,"Wonder why it is that the first facial lines to appear are often around the eyes. All that smiling, perhaps? Whatever the case, no one wants those tiny lines accenting their eyes and we know that crow's feet are really for the birds!Cellex-C, an acknowledged leader in the field of anti-aging products, has developed Eye Contour Cream Plus, a light peach-colored cream that will reduce those telltale lines. With 5% L-ascorbic acid it puts to work the one form of Vitamin C that the body recognizes and uses for collagen production.For use apply to the eye area after cleansing and toning. Follow with moisturizer if desired. There may be a slight tingling sensation after the cream is applied, which is a sign that the L-ascorbic acid is being absorbed into the skin.Recommended for all but ultra sensitive skin types, this cream causes no untoward reactions such as a sensitivity to sunlight.Our clothes are wrinkle free - why not us?"
3,Not as advertised,I am disappointed with this pair of earrings. The silver doesn't look real even though the 925 signature is present. The amber is also not very attractive as shown online.
3,Fun for the Fans,"I'll be honest; this wasn't what I expected. Before this CD, the only exposure I'd had to the fictional Subdigitals was the ending credits music for the Code Lyoko cartoon (a lyricless version of ""Break Away""). I was expecting more of a rock sound, but when I was the very upbeat pop sound of ""Planet Net"". ""Angel of Mine"" is closer to what I expected, though still restrained (Not necessarily a bad thing). Davin certainly has a good voice, though at some points sounding (to me) unsure of himself.The lyrics are generally well-written, but there are a few moments where it seems the French-to-English translation did not quite work (notably ""Secret Life"").Overall, I'd say this is definitely worth getting if you're a Code Lyoko fan."
3,General massage,"Massage Therapy student so i figured i would purchase this book. It briefly touched upon a good amount of massages. But as I said one page was how much info you got for each massage, enough to have a general idea for a friend not a practice."
3,read when you get time,After having read all of James Earl Hardy's book I was a little disappointed with this one. I did not like how one chapter would be about his professional life and then it would pick up with Pooquie in the following chapter. I wish Mr. Hardy would have touched on Pooquie's reaction to not being able to catch up with Mitchell because he was with Montee. I could not believe that Mr. Hardy allowed every man in the book to be gay and one bisexual. This was not one of Mr. Hardy's best books but it was not one of his worse.
2,SO MUCH FOR CONTENT! TOO MUCH POLITICS IN IT!,"Mr Hardy is a fantastic writer. Shoot, I love all his work, but I find myself bored reading this book. Unlike B-boy Blues and 2nd time around, LTOYW does not have the suspenseful conflict that Raheim and Little Bit had back in the day. He just parallels a lot of details from the other books, which makes me think why is this called a sequel when it's just a repetition. I didn't appreciate much the content of Little Bit's republican encounter and how Mr. Hardy incorporated that as if it was the center of the story. Monty's Bisexuality is ambiguous... and Little Bit's encounter with him wasn't really hot. Raheim still plays the old boy... and it never continued on as to Raheim coming out. It's a great read, but don't be too thrilled with the money you spending. Spend on the Bboy Blues or 2nd Time Around."
3,Didn't quite get it....,"I had read B-Boy Blues years ago. I saw this one in the library and decided it must be as good. It wasn't. When Mitchell got missing and was with Monte and Pooqui never mentioned it, that threw me. Especially since Pooqui was so jealous of Mitchell being around other men. Also when Pooqui got missing and never really stated where he was that was a suprise that Mitchell didn't once think he was in Cali getting his freak on. Some other things didn't add up either. Im not sure if I will read more books by Mr Hardy but the summer aint over yet."
4,WHY DO MEN CHEAT !,I actually enjoyed this book. The sad part is that cheating happenes and unless you are strong enough to fight it stay away from anything that leds to it and that is what Little Bit finds out in the end. Not all men cheat and that is one area that JEH left out in the book but he has develop the characters as well as his writing in this book. I suggest it anyone.
3,To cheat or not to cheat,"Continuing his bestselling series of books, Hardy throws another curve into Mitchell and Raheim's relationship. While Raheim is away in California filming a movie, Mitchell is constantly tempted by other African American men he meets. And when he keeps running into the openly bisexual Montee in various places, Mitchell finds his commitment to Raheim exceptionally challenged. While Hardy's characters and his writing remain strong, he dilutes this novel with many diatribes and detours which give the book a disconnected atmosphere. I believe all of what Hardy wants to convey through this novel has merit, but by not weaving it seamlessly through Mitchell's struggles to remain true to his Pooquie, he ultimately leaves the reader disappointed in some respects. After the stellar ""The Day Eazy-E Died"", ""Love the One You're With"" is a bit dim, but still worthy."
5,BACK TO HIS BEST................THANK GOD !!!,"James Earl Hardy returns with the 5th installment of his ""B Boy Blues"" series featuring Mitchell and Raheim along with a colorful cast of supporting characters and thank god a decent story.after the last couple of books left me feeling majorly disappointed this is return to form the writing although still a little preachy and in ya face is back to the style and content of the first 2 books in the series the action takes place when Raheim is in LA making his first movie and Mitchell is left alone in NYC where all he finds is PHYNE men who wanna get him naked the story moves along at a good pace the only criticism is that the story takes place in 1995 come on JEH move it along a bit we wanna know what goes on in the 21st century ....."
2,careful with the band,I've had one of these for 5 yrs. I bought a more expensive watch --gold highlights not goldplated because I thought I would have it for a while. The band first broke (the metal just wears away) about 2 years ago and eeked by under warranty. It just broke again the other day and the band costs $1600 (more than I paid for the watch). I guess I'll just stick a leather band on it and next time pay the extra and get a rolex.
2,"Underwhelming, feels like a deleted scene","Don't get me wrong, I am definitley a ""Bakuretsu Tenshi"" fan. I usually go for more solid fare than Burst Angel but I fell for its quasi-western motif and old-school ""Xena-rescues-Gabrielle (again)"" format. When I heard this OVA was to be a prequel, I had hoped it would be an anime version of the (so far) Japanese-only manga. Instead we got what amounted to a one-shot episode that reveals practically nothing about our duo, doing nothing to further the overall story and nothing to develop our characters (except, perhaps, for Jo's sense of humour - i.e. the cat scene at the start, which for me was the only element worth-while).In the end, ""Infinity"" felt like one big deleted scene amongst a bunch of other half-hearted DVD extras. It wasn't the worst episode, by far, but if you buy it, go into it knowing that it is nothing more than a ""lost"" episode that doesn't reveal much."
3,Spirit and Angels,"The product arrived in record time. Outside of few magic marker scratch outs, the information was entertaining."
3,It was ok,"I expected a lot more from this book, all the hype I heard from people about it didn't even compare to how poorly I feel it was put together, some of it was cool and his explainations of letters to your angels etc, but all n all it wasn't worth the buy.sorry I hate leaving bad reviews."
5,SPIRT GUIDES & ANGEL GUARDIANS,"A very easy read ,informative,seems to have real research and personal thought put into these beliefs.I would recommend to this book to any one with an open mind and who is truly willing to listen."
4,Like this Pan,"This is a good grill pan. It heats evenly, is light to handle, goes from stovetop to oven and cleans up easily. I have made burgers, steak and chicken so far and the results have been good. For the price I am very pleased with this pan."
5,Excellent performance and easy clean-up,"I purchased this pan a few weeks ago, having never used or owned one before. I have been very pleased with it. I have mostly used it for grilling sandwiches and pork chops, and it worked very well for those tasks. Prior to buying this pan, I used my small electric grill quite often, but it was a pain to clean. This pan cleans so easily and nicely, that it is now my preference over the electric grill. I just use a small amount of non-stick spray before use and clean-up is a cinch. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Cooks food well,"This pan is large, good quality, vegetables come nicely grilled, not mushy. On the downside grill marks are not prominent and do not use it with metal utensils despite what the box says! Its scratches easily..."
4,very good grill pan,"I've always wanted to grill and the other pans I've looked at need a stove top, needless to say I've been very disappointed until I found this grill pan. It's true it does not have really deep grill marks but it does a good job grilling. The size is good and I think it gets even heating. I am very satisfied with it."
4,Great grill pan.,"This is my first grill pan and I am very pleased with it overall. I love that its big enough to cook 4 pieces of fish or chicken or whatever. It has a great sear and is easy to clean. The only downside is that it doesn't always leave great grill marks as the ridges are pretty low. Other than that, I love it and can't believe the price."
4,Pretty good grill pan,"This is a pretty good grill pan, it works well and it is pretty easy to clean. But then I noticed that some of the teflon is already scraping off even though we don't use metal tongs of tools that would scratch it. That is my only disapointment."
2,Too Light Weight--Disappointed,"I have a similar pan that I absolutely love, & I thought when ordering this that I was getting the same pan. Unfortunately, this is MUCH lighter than mine, & I know from experience that a pan this light will eventually warp & not work on a flat surface (glass top) stove. It will wobble so much that even heating will be impossible. I thought the Cuisinart name meant I'd be getting a quality pan, but not in this case.I'd hope to give this new pan as a gift, but instead will probably return it & keep looking for a duplicate of the one in my kitchen. Sorry I don't know the brand, but it has a ""W"" on the handle. This style of pan is wonderful for so many things (my fave is quesadillas)."
4,"Cooks a delicious steak, but beware of smoke",I bought this pan because I missed grilled food while living in an apartment without a grill. So far the pan has worked perfectly and has helped prepare some delicious and perfectly cooked meats. I had never used a grill pan before and was surprised by the amount of smoke created when cooking steak. If you plan to cook steak with this make sure you have a good fan!
2,Cure worse than the disease?,Tried this after finding Nature's Miracle to be anything BUT a miracle.This product may in fact neutralize the urine but it's hard to say since it comes with an overpowering perfume. The company is proud of the fragrance saying that focus groups asked for it. I have a message for them: sometimes the customer is Wrong.
1,Incorrect product,"I ordered this Urine Off Vet Strength from Amazon and it was fulfilled by Entirely Pets. First of all, it took 10 days to reach me! Then when I opened the box, it was the REGULAR Urine Off, not the vet strength. I immediately called Entirely Pets and they insisted I had the product I ordered. I told the guy that I had it pulled up on my screen adn he said Amazon had it wrong! He said they didn't sell that product. So I pulled it up on their own website and there it was , plain as day. He actually argued with me that they didn't sell it when they were offering it on their website! I cannot believe the complete and utter incompetence of some people.Bottom line: Don't order this product if you want the vet strength of Urine Off. You will not get it."
2,my dog urine stains barely responded to Urine Off,My dog's urine stains on my hardwood floor may have been there for months. I have saturated the spot four times now and seen a minimal change. I was too gullible about the product's promises of removing all stain.
1,Deceptive Practice,"Be careful with this company. The item sent was the ""regular strength"" product and not the ""Veterinarian Strength."" They have done this before and are aware of it. Company is misleading and deceptive."
2,"There are other, less expensive products","Try Nature's Miracle, which you still have to use a lot of, but it works better and costs less."
2,Nearly Worthless,"Here's the deal.... if you let your animals pee on the carpet, nothing helps except new carpet. Trust me on that one- I've tried everything. The enzyme formulas like this are way better than nothing and will keep you sane while Phideaux (French for Fido) grows up, but don't expect miracles. Also - this particular brand is not as effective as a brand called ""Urine-Off"" - but that is typically $80/gallon. It's the same stuff- my guess is this is less concentrated.My advice is hold off getting the new carpet until the dog (or the toddler) is at least two years old, but when that day comes, rip the old stuff out, including any plywood sub-flooring that got urine saturated, and start over."
5,Great Christmas gift!,The item was delivered in a very timely manner and the recipient was very pleased with the quality and style of the belt buckle!! :)
4,"Purely Transitional, but still compulsory listening","Each of these four tracks varies greatly... not nearly as disiplined as the follow-up to it, Beaches and Canyons. Buy that first, then check this out.Worth buying for the 1st track alone: 4 min of interesting guitar noodling that sounds like a broken music box. Sounds like it's being played on the strings between the guitar nut and the tuning knobs. Nothing else like it.The Second and Third tracks are interesting, sort of a bridge between the 80s hardcore sound of their early days and their modern, improvised ""new-age noise"" sound of present.Check this out."
4,Made me smile,Don't be put off by the candy-colored uterus on the cover. It's really a romance. Charming characters with all the time in the world of youth. I enjoyed it and hope to read more from the author.
3,Sounds great,I like believing my pet is getting the nutrition she needs. This is an easy way to feel I'm doing the best I can to provide her nutritional needs.
5,GREATNESS OF THE KINGDOM is the most excellent book ever written on The Kingdom of God. I,Fabulous book on the subject of God's Kingdom. A classic book. I was named in honor of the author many years ago.ALVAHOMES
3,a word of caution,"Yes, this is a detailed, but readable work on the Kingdom of God. I would give this caution to potential buyers, however. Dr McClain comes at the subject from a decidedly dispensational, premillennial perspective, so this is not the final word on the Kingdom. But it is still a modern classic."
2,Bland,I decided to buy this because it got such great recommendations from other reviewers. I'm afraid I found it really bland and boring - a bit like Latin elevator music. Really disappointing. Perhaps I've just got rotten taste. No vocals spoiled it for me too.
3,Warning -- Content may be Esoteric,I have met Dr. Bond and listened to him speak and he is an EXCELLENT speaker/teacher! My only warning for the book is that I found it rather achedemic and aimed at achedemics. The language is a bit stilted and I am unfimiliar with MANY of the references. It is NOT light reading; but knowing something of what Dr. Bond knows I am sure there is treasure in the book.C
5,Inside story of President Lincoln,"I think most people agree that Lincoln was one of the best presidents in American History, if not the best. This DVD show what was the driving force behind his success and the difficulties he faced. I watched this DVD more than once. It's very interesting."
4,A very different perspective,"i myself have always been very intersted in the Civil War history, read all about it all the Biographies and all the history books, so to me this is great some new version to the history as it was ""dectatied"" to me when i was in school, so to me this is fresh new look at him, i honestly really always admired the man, what man who went through all that negative things when he was a child to the leading the american civil warto the death of his son, And in my eye Lincoln will never be a ""Loser"" with anyone in history theres always the dark side of life that gets dragged out for the public every now and again."
3,Not Their Best....,I got this album not that long ago and i think that it is an o.k album.The first track'Gas In My Car' is amazing and so is the cover of Bad Manners 'Special Brew' it is a covers album with a couple of their own songs but it could of been better....
4,Good cd,"This is a real good cd the only reason I didnt give this cd 5 stars is because I dont like the song my hair, but you need this cd!"
3,Travel essays with a history of the Mafia,"What an odd book. A history of the Mafia mixed with fond travel essays. Would a history of the Mafia in Italy be too heavy without the travel essays? Maybe, but I would not have read it. Would a travel book about Naples and Sicily that ignored the Mafia be dishonest? Maybe, but I would have enjoyed this one a lot more without the Mafia history.Would a travel book without maps or photos be frustrating to read? Yes. A history book without maps or photos or an index? Yes, frustrating.I would not read it again. There is no one to whom I want to give the book. I would not recommend it to anyone who did not want to read a lot about the Mafia in Italy or Italian government after WWII. A student of small-time terrorism might like it. It was readable but not fun to read."
4,Midnight in Sicily,"A must read for anyone visiting Sicily. It captures the atmosphere of the island, especially the menacing disorder that is often evident in the local life. The author's description of the role of the Mafia and the complicity of the government rings true, and the description of local cuisine and custom is skillfully woven into the story. That said, the author displays a political and social point of view which I do not always share, but I find his observations almost always worthwhile."
5,"Great Read, Unique Travel Writing","Before I travelled to Sicily, I was looking for a book that would capture the culture of this Italian island. Other than DiLapedusa's ""The Leopard"" (fiction) I wasn't aware of and couldn't seem to find any other books on the island. I stumbled across this and was charmed from page one. This is really a little masterpiece of travel writing/journalism/history. Although I normally don't find time to read while travelling, I couldn't put this book down. Don't listen to any negative reviews, this book is superbly written, insighful and a very comprehensive text on Sicilian culture. It might be said that the focus is loosely Mafioso, but the author does an unmatched job at integrating history, food, and the intricasies of Sicilian society and culture. You'll be blown away. This one's for my library!"
2,What a disappointment,"What I thought was a book on the history, food, and culture was infact a book on the intricate details on the mafia... This book is a diservice to the already narrow-minded people who think only of mafia when they think of Sicily. I want to learn what makes Sicily what it is. I was even more disappointed that the mafia wasn't left out of the art scene. The author has done his research on the history on the mafia, but if I wanted a book on the mafia I would have gotten one. Perhaps he should rename his book, 'The Sicilian Mafia And Everything It Permiates'."
3,Midnight in Sicily,This is a very intricately and detailed story of the mafia in Sicily. If you like a quick read it is not for you: Enjoyable otherwise.
4,A great book to read before a trip to southern Italy,"I read this book with pleasure and excitement. If you love Italy or are planning a trip to Sicily you need to get it In fact, jest read it, wherever you might be, maybe with a little glass of grappa."
2,Too detailed,Too repetitive - early on one got the message that the Mafia (or other names for criminal organizations) penetrated Italy at all levelsToo many namesUnhnecessary history of Sicilan cuisineI skipped many pagesI was not drawn to pick up the book and read on
5,The Body's Map: A Guide to a Healing Experience,"This book has served me well as a way to further my healing experience, and as a way to share information about Integrated Awareness with others. Lansing and Julie have done an outstanding job capturing the compassion and grace inherent in Integrated Awareness, and providing further opportunities for me for change, growth, harmony and healing in my life. I love this work, and I love this book."
1,Awful filmmaking -- no point --,"I'm not sure who wrote these 5 star reviews on here, and I suspect they are friends of the director -- but this movie is interminable -- I see at least a hundred movies a year, and Praxis rates in the bottom 5 percentile of those films for the past several years.There is no point to the film that is not made in the first 15 minutes -- it then lasts another hour and a half. Free of dialogue for almost the entire movie, it is just awful. Long extended sequences of nothingness. Its an ""art film"". Only there is very little art, and you might as well look at snapshopts instead of a moving motion picture.Don't waste your money. Even the nude scene (swimming) is boring despite two very handsome men.This is a director's vanity project, and he clearly didn't keep in mind his audience."
3,Great Cover Design!,"I will not be another redundant hack by repeating the film's description. I consider this film in the non-traditional or experimental catgory of a young man with an inner turmoil. Yes, the actors are goodlooking and sexy, whether one concludes the lead character is gay, bisexual or just mentally/personality challenged. If you want a linear storyline with a story arc (along with R-rated sex scenes) then spend your money elsewhere. If you enjoy the challenge of a psychological/mystical/existential drama with haunting, visual imagery and very creative film editing all in a non-choronolgical time line, then you will find this a wonderful film to own. But this may require repeated watching to 'uncover the layers'. For all the artistic qualities of this 'concept film' this one is not for the masses...but for the few who do, you will highly appreciate watching."
1,"This disaster doesn't qualifies even as a ""film""","I totally agree with the previous 1 star reviewer. The only people who can write something ""half-good"" about this ridiculous project there must be direct family or close friends, if not the director himself hidden under an alias. Specially after watching the enormeous ""ego"" that he shows throughout this totally wasted 93' minutes of ""creation"".I won't spare any more second talking about this ""thing"". I felt so sorry about the actors, who are quite handsome and seem very committed to an absurd and totally void product. About Mr Alex Pacheco, I can assure you that I've never would watch anything signed by him. If he's able to do anything else after ""this""Yes, the guys on the cover are beautiful and talented, but neither of these atributes musn't fool you. Nothing erotic about the naked scene. Like dead fish over marble.Thank god I haven't spared any money at all on this one!!!"
1,Watch on FFWd,I ended up watching this on fast forward and still thought it was way too long. An overly artsy attempt at making a movie...don't waist your time.
3,Not Tom Hanks,I searched and searched for a Woody Doll that had the original Tom Hanks voice but I couldn't find one. My three year old wanted to know why his voice was different from the movie and why does his hat have two holes in it. The holes are there because there are a number of annoying security twisty ties securing Woody and his hat to the packaging. The hat doesn't stay on very well but other than those things I've mentioned it's not a bad toy.
3,toy story woody,"Is a good toy, is very durable, also is a nice toy for boys, is not a violent toy, is friendly..... that is good for these days..."
1,"Did not ship as promised, missed Christmas!","Was supposed to be delivered a week ago, never got notice from the seller. My daughter wanted Woody for Christmas and now I can't find one and I can't cancel the order. Very disappointed. Will not use seller again."
5,Great Buy..wish it had original voice!!,"Great Buy...Speedy delivery. My son's birthday isn't until May, but the voice works and all seems well so far. Just wish he had the original voice!!"
4,it's a fun doll,my boy loves toy story and loves playing with his woody doll. only thing i wish was that woody's voice was a louder. Compared to Buzz you can barely here woody.
4,Nice hoe for weeding,"Arrived quickly. I bought to replace a hoe that had been in the family over 40 years. It states a professional model and will work but in our humble opionion not professional just basic. It appears quality standards are determined by $$. It is the best we could find so it will do, and we are happy to have it."
1,Poorly made product,"I loved the idea of the extra attachments, but the fact that they all work very poorly was disappointing. I wish I never wasted the money on this. Not only is metal bad for your hair, I feel like in order to have results I had to FRY my hair. No Thanks!"
2,I regret that I bought this product,"I bough this product and was very excited about my purchase as it had a lot of extras. Unfortunately, none of them worked for me. The results do not last longer either. I do not recommend, even if you buy it cheap."
2,You must be hard headed!,This is ok just to touch up the top of my hairstyle but it's really quite painful wearing those big clips that hold the rollers on...wish I had done more research before buying
1,Appalled and disgusted,"Amazing! A how-to manual that encourages illegal/unethical behavior available at any major bookstore. It's like being able to buy street drugs at the corner pharmacy! The author encourages women to lie, cheat and manipulate -- without regard to innocent persons -- i.e., children of a failed marriage. I especially liked (NOT) the case studies where women manufactured evidence to have their soon-to-be-ex's put in jail. I didn't realize that was legal. IMO, the author's attitudes and methods are counterproductive to the advances made by women's rights groups over the years, since they encourage women to remain dependent on someone else. I returned my copy since I didn't want this author receiving any royalty monies from me."
4,It Can Happen To YOU!,"Ladies, A few little marriage troubles? Well, buy this book the day he brings you flowers home unexpectedly, compliments your outfit quite out of the blue or any other time when he is suddenly extra polite. The longer you have been married, the more you need to study this like your livlihood depends on it....because, IT DOES! Best of luck and stay 3 steps ahead."
4,why 4 stars....,"why am i giving this book 4 stars as man,when it is clearly anti-male?simply because this is what ""modern day females"" do to working men once they are ""bored"" with the marriage,step by step...men who read this book along with:-1)that bitch/venus-roy shepard/mary t cleary(highly recommended)2)the predatory female3)booby trapped men beware4)in sheeps's clothingwill safeguard themselves from poor choices of the many bad women out there..."
1,Dont they already have a sure win??,"Come on now are books like this really neccessary anymore for women? The feminazis have already made sure that women have an unfair upper hand when it comes to the courts and can get away with making false accusations of abuse or even ""marital rape"" in divorce court. The chances are the only reason that the scumbag bottom feeding divorce lawyer wrote this book is so that women realize how good of a lawyer (or rather how much of a slimeball) he is and get his service in court. Its a shame when a man writes a book to further the feminist agenda of rationalized greed & hatred."
4,Great Book from an Amazing Store,"Fantastic, obscure, wildly entertaining...the only complaint i have is that not all the films in the store are reviewed in here..."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this book,but was unfortunately disappointed by it. The layout of reviews makes it very difficult to find the reviews that you want. Then once you find them, nearly every movie receive a positive review! The few movies that are negatively reviewed are immediately followed by an opposing positive review. So apparently every movie is great! In addition to these problems, the book also includes television shows?! - Still, for the Amazon price it might be worth a brief look...But mine went into the trash can shortly after I bought it."
3,Highly recommended,"This item is very instructively, not only for ""real"" mathematicians. Of course, sometimes it's very difficult to ""read"". It gives me pleasure to own the proof of FLT."
4,From an oldster,"OK, it duzn't include ALL my favorites, but lots of 'em. I'm more partial to the heavier stuff -- The SLAYED album especially. If you still have a turntable you can get all their LPs for like five dollars each in the used bins and pick 'em for 'yerselF. I had the pleasure of seeing 'um live in 1975 (yes, 1975) -- one of the first concerts I ever saw, I was 16 years old. They warmed up for ZZ Top in NY. Wow-ie. I was hooked ever since. And if this CD is all the SLADE you ever buy -- you can't go wrong. They're is a very, very, good chance that many of the songs on this CD will stick in your head for a lifetime."
3,The best band ever,"Well what can you say, 20 tracks of brilliance from the greatest live band ever to come out of Britain; Holder and Lea are songwriters in the same bracket as Lennon and McCartney, Goffin and King and Leiber and Stoller - Slade are one of Britain's most loved, yet least honoured bands. This CD has it all, from their early shouters like ""Cum on Feel The Noize"" through to the whole ""White Album In 5 Minutes"" of ""How Does it Feel"" - one of the 10 best songs ever written. No one who was in the crowd at the Reading Festival in 1980 will ever forget the wall of sound that blasted across the field at the beginning of Slade's set, arguably their finest hour, and this CD is further proof of absolute genius. Buy this one from the band that SHOULD have rung in the millenium. It is nothing short of criminal that they are now inactive - come on boys, you can do it again...!!!"
5,Outstanding hits compilation from a unique band,"This is an outstanding compilation of hits from a one-of-a-kind English band. I still don't know why they never hit in the States because they recorded a slew of gems and were an exciting live band. I particularly liked hearing ""Merry Xmas"" for the first time, which was never played in Boston where I grew up, and the range of songs they produced through the ups and downs. Their musicianship is better than I recall, too. A great collection from an underappreciated group."
5,Leicester Bangs Review (1997):,"Slade - Feel The Noize: Greatest Hits (Polydor)Back in the early 1970s, Slade were the first band I fell in love with. T-Rex may have been cooler and Bowie definitely weirder, but what does that matter when you're seven years old and the only access you've got to pop music is Ed Stewart's Saturday morning show and Top Of The Pops on a Thursday evening.In those days Slade lived on Top Of The Pops, churning out classic stomp pop singles, one after the other. All the hits are here, 21 top 30 singles including their half dozen number ones, and it all sounds bloody great a quarter century on.It's about time Slade received the respect they deserve and it's great to see this excellent compilation available."
3,Roller,"I really like this roller. Once you get used to the pace of how much to ""spray"" into the roller at a time it's pretty easy. I do not like that you can't add a broom stick like you would a regular roller to paint ceilings or tall walls. You can BUY a ""pole extension"" from Wagner but that is more than the roller!"
3,Needs a longer roller extension,"The roller itself works without a hitch. The lack of a longer extension for ceilings, and taller walls is a drag. After looking for a longer tube extension, found that the price for it was considerably more than the roller itself. Not!"
2,One word; ERGONOMICS,"OK, It was fast, and it rolled evenly, but a couple of problems surfaced. You had to really feather the trigger to prevent splatter, and if you forgot, you had to stop for cleanup, especially on the ceiling. I had to go back to a conventional roller. I could load paint and roll a room in about 20 minutes, but trying to actually use it comfortably just wasn't happening. I am in pretty good shape and it wore me out. Also, don't buy the roller cleaner with this product. it doesn't work with the power roller, but does work great with a conventional roller"
3,"Great, but no extension equals tired arms","I just painted a house with this and loved it. It's nice to cover large area of walls without rolling your brush into the pan every minute. The only thing is that without an extension, my arms got tired fast."
1,works as advertised would perfer different design,"I've had good experience will all my Wagner purchases up to this point so I thought that the paint crew roller would be no different. I'm a semi professional painter and when painting a rental house I thought I'd try out this roller for my airless sprayer. The paint delivery worked fine; it was just the strange bend in the roller assembly that made work very awkward. As well, a swivel attachment is a must otherwise the hose is a bear to deal with."
2,mnshopper,The seal on the roller started to drip after about an hour. I was painting a 2 story room and didnt notice all the drips that had fallen onto the lower portion of the wall until some of them had already dried and are now a fixture on my wall. Im not all that impressed with it.
2,Good idea bad design & implementation,"Bought this for my A2 AR-15 and followed the directions... Wait... there were no directions. At first you would say... Why would anyone need directions for three allen screws? Well, this thing went downrange on my third shot through it, never to be found again. I work on guns a bunch and know what I am doing here but the only thing I have to show for it is three deep gouges at the tip of my barrel! Beware..."
1,AR 15/22 Adapter,Added a lot of bulk to the barrel just to be able to add a flash hider. Removed and had a gunsmith thread the barrel for $50 and add the A2 Bird Cage. Kept coming loose at the firing range.
2,Sort of ok.,"I was dissapointed in the set screws not staying tight. The barrel heats up, expands, when things cool down, the screws get loose and it drops off. The thing fell of three times. I finally wrapped a few turns of electrical tape around the barrel, before torking it down the last time. At least now I can catch it before it falls off without warning. Maybe glue would be better? I would have been better off to have the barrel threaded."
2,doesn't marry with A2 Flash Hider,I understood that this would marry with the A2 Flash Hider sold by m1surplus. I purchased both and they do not fit each other. Returning both products.
5,Wonderful!! Kids are sure to love it!! Mine do!,"What a great story! My kids are crazy about this book! We read a lot ofbooks in our house, and we keep coming back to this one, which is quicklybecoming a top-ten favorite. The pictures are light, colorful, and detailed.My children giggle at the crab with the big lips and the clouds dressed uplike pirates. They're fascinated by the army of snails. This book is a sure winner. It's a must-read for little beach goers who loverip-roaring adventure."
3,"Average Art, Story","This is a good kid's book. Not great, but not bad, either. The story is abour Brad and Emily, and their adventure on the trail of pirate treasure.The art is somewhat flat and uninspiring. While the story is adventurous, this book doesn't seem to capture my kid's imagination as well as some of the other's in their collection."
1,bleah...,"What ruined this book for me, was its constant upbeat attitude, coupled with every chapter finishing with a fictional person who ""followed"" the advice and found success.For example: ""And when Ted started hanging out at the bookstore, it was only a matter of a few weeks before he literally tripped over Brittany, and they've been together ever since!""Rah, rah, rah... If the advice in this book was so great, the authors wouldn't have had to invent success stories.Also, whatever self-esteem I had when I started reading this book was destroyed when I wasn't able to re-create any of these success stories. I ended up hating myself when its rather simplistic advice didn't work for me.In short, this book sucks. The only good advice in it is to carry a business card, so you can give prospective dates your number.Sharyn and Katy should get out of the dating-advice business, before they hurt anyone else."
5,"New guide highlights heritage, natural history of Miss River","Rolling on the River..........In a few weeks, it'll be road-trip weather,and we have some of the nation's prettiest highways at our fingertips--US Hwy 61 andseveral other state and county highways form the parkway known asAMERICA's Great River Road. Making that drive even easier is a new guide:""DISCOVER! AMERICA'S GREAT RIVER ROAD, Volume 1.""This 240-page guide highlights the heritage, natural history and recreationalactivities available along the Mississippi River from St. Paul, Mn., to Dubuque,Iowa. It includes maps, historical and geological points of interest, bike trails,bird watching spots and short features on small towns, parks, and villages.----STAR TRIBUNE, Minneapolis, Mn. April 1997"
1,Discover! America's Great River Road,"While planning for yet another summer of rides on the motorcycle,my wife and I had this book sent as part of our research.We were very disappointed, it has 5 stars. So what is the problem?For one thing it is not well written nor does it seem up to date.We travel a lot, all over the USA and the world.It is like asking about a good cafe, first you need to know the people who felt it was great. Do they know good food?We know well done books and this is not one. I move it to the waste fill."
5,Interesting story,"If you are looking to learn about modern Jewish funeral practices, read this book. It tells a story about a group of Jews who wanted to return to traditional practices and the obstacles put in their way mostly by other Jews. I read it in one sitting and plan to reread it soon."
5,A CD good for any mood,"Aright, normally you put in a CD according to whatever mood you're in, and for me, it sometimes gets difficult to match the music and emotion. However, the Marshes have put out an album here which matches any mood. This is a great album, it's a slightly different style than I've heard before, which is always a good thing, and the way all the instruments are meshed together is great. The power behind this album is so vast it makes you wish it was longer than 30 minutes."
3,Not what I thought,"I bought these cards for my 10 year old cousin for Christmas because he has taken an interest in French. The cards were not at all what I thought they were. They are simply index cards with blue writing and have little visual appeal. The cards are simplistic with small pictures of the target nouns on each card. All cards do have phoenetic pronunciaiton and teach basic nouns, which are helpful for beginners to build a good base of les mots franais. Don't expect much with these cards visually, but children under 12 should get a basic French vocabulary from them."
3,Not quite what I remembered,"I bought this because I had purchased a sample size months ago and I loved it, but when we received the can we were disappointed.It wasn't quite what we had thought - maybe we'll just stick to the original almond roca."
3,They say the sequel is never as good as the original...,"And that holds true here. I loved THESE IS MY WORDS and couldn't wait for this book to come out. After reading it, I can't understand how one catastrophic event after another can be so slow-paced. The story never picked up steam despite constant tragedy and upheaval. I believe that the theme behind the story is supposed be about resurrection and the strength of family ties, but I never felt anything but depressed and bored.I wish I could have agreed with the other reviewers who loved this book, but I just can't. If you enjoyed the prequel, it's definitely worth a try, but not a worthy comparison."
5,Sarah's Quilt,"As good if not better than her first book, ""These Is My Words"".I look forward to reading the third book in this series."
3,Sarah's Quilt,"This book was dissapointing and almost ridiculous. I loved the first book of the series and purchased a copy of this one expecting something similar, but found instead that it like many other book series was too reliant on the popularity of it's predecessor. The main character Sarah is literally faced with a new disaster every chapter. It's too much. She is a strong and likeable character and does not need a plot climax every few pages to keep my attention. I found so much tribulation to be distracting and repeatedly put the book down out of irritation. The introduction and developing relationship with Udell did not appeal to me. He reminded me of a lethargic grandpa not at all a match for Sarah. I wish authors would spend less time expanding the page count and more time on staying true to their charachters."
3,"Sarah seems...well, older","I did enjoy this book although my determination in finishing it came mainly from my appreciation of Sara's gumption in These is My Words. The book is good, and you've never seen more calamity hit one woman in such a short space of time. The events seem more...contrived than they did in the first, and I got the feeling Turner was really working to keep the reader involved. I stayed with the book, and I'm glad I did, but Sarah didn't seem as real to me as she did in the first book."
4,"Courage, adventure and romance in Revolutionary America","This book is a must read. Although Kenneth Roberts' ""Northwest Passage"" may be better known, ""Arundel"" is a much more exciting and captivating book. Roberts follows the path of young Steven Nason of Arundel, Maine, through the trials and hardships with Benedict Arnold's army on their fatal march on Quebec in 1775. One of the most compelling aspects of the book is Nason's relationship with local Indian tribes and how that kept the endeavor from complete failure. This book was impossible to put down and has made me want to follow Steven Nason's adventures in the book, ""Rabble In Arms"". Although I read ""Arundel"" for an extra-curricular U.S.History assignment, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an intriguing introduction to the Revolutionary War or who just has a thirst for adventure."
2,Much better books available,"While this book is okay, you can get much better historical novels. Try Allen W Eckert books. He has written several that cover this same approximate era and places. This book is just not worth the money."
4,arundel,I enjoyed the book but it was a little too detailed at times. I never lost intrest in it andI found it to be very factual.
3,The Sopping Thursday,"A short Gorey story, for all of the Edward Gorey, fans you know who you are. The plot such as it is takes place on a rainy day in England. Aren't they all? A tale of a black dog and infant and more umbrella's than most people know what to do with. Edward Gorey, started out as an illustrationist for the New Yorker, among other magazine. If you ever saw his Addams Family, drawings you would recognize the basis for both the series and the movies. His tales were often seen as too dark for children. If you can find the Gorey Alphabet, buy it. It is a wonderful book for fractious children. A is for Amy, eaten by bears. B is for Basil,who fell down the stairs.."
3,"Joy for any one who likes rain, umbrellas and small towns.","In this book we spend one Thursday in a small English town where, ofcoarse, it is raining. People stand with umbrellas in the streets, lose their umbrellas, go to buy umbrellas and visit neighbours homes to borrow umbrellas. The pictures are very light, but EG makes up for this by making atleast one object in each scene solid black."
2,Limited life trimmer,"This was a very short lived product. It worked really well for a short period of time then it just started losing power and not keeping a charge. I've since gone back to the ""corded"" version."
2,this reviewer was right..,"i happened to buy this trimmer at a ladies Beauty Supply Store. I really liked it at first.. but over time, maybe over a year, the charge wouldn't hold. This was even after weeks of keeping it in the re-charger. There is no indicator to let you know if the shaver is low or fully powered..The last straw for me was while i was shaving, there wasn't enough power to shave basic ""peach fuzz"".. On several attempts the damn thing snagged, and pulled. I let out a yelp and dropped it in the toilet.. apparently where it belonged..Fished it out, and vowed never to buy another one of these again.."
1,A very impressive track list...,"Even more impressive is the amazing Japanese technology used to place all 140 tracks on one CD. (Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.) Perhaps the track listing from the CD cover will illuminate their mysterious technique: 1)Beatles Medley 2)Abba Medley 3)Stevie Wonder Medley 4)The Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band In The World 5)Supremes Medley 6)Star Wars And Other Hits 7)Beatles Medley(Single Version) 8)Abba Medley(Single Version).Yes, if you're looking for 20 - 30 seconds of a whole bunch of top-ten singles, all run together, then you've found it here.And no expense has been spared to bring you authentic ""45"" sound quality. The ""music"" manages to simultaneously sound both muddy and tinny.If I had to sum up this CD in one word, it would be ""NO!"""
1,I was not impressed,I ended up giving it to Salvation Army. Takes more than one cake mix. More like 1 and a half to fill it up. I didn't think it was worth the money.
2,Nice pan--no directions!!!,The pan is good quality and it works well but it came with no instructions so I had to search the web for use instructions. I found some vague ones and mostly figured it out through trial and error. That is a huge minus as far as this product is concerned. I wouldn't order this product if I knew then what I know now.
4,Very encouraging!,"I appreciate how Carla Curtis includes scriptures for encouragement and has taken the time to research the topic to reach her target audience.A Single Woman's Parenting Journey is in a simple to read format that can easily be incorporated in the single woman's day.Chapter 3: Set Your Goals and chapter 4: Love and Pamper Yourself are crucial in any woman's life, yet more so in the life of a single female parent. Re-enforcing goal setting and supporting self-pampering are important ""survival tidbits""! I recommend reading these chapters first if you feel lost in a career or over-worked.A great close to this book are the sample prayers which target specific areas which effect single female parents. This is a great addition to a single female parent's library! -LC"
1,Very disappointed...,"There was no mention of the religious tone to the book in the description. The book has very large print, which I believe the publisher used to make the book seem like it has something to say; it doesn't. The book is filled with cliche after cliche. There are lots of good books out there for single moms/parents, and this is not one of them. I rarely return books, but this one is going back."
5,Good to get your through the muck of life.,"Jeff Caudill's lyrics are perfect in this emo-core masterpiece as they deal with regret and renewal in the most personal sense to our hero as he attempts to get back to where he once was (or at least begin to go forward).Music is rockin as well which is a great complement. In terms of the sound, close to Texas is the Reason and Brown Lobster Tank. Nice addition has Gwen Stefani singing the closing cover song."
1,"Uh, would be nice if I ever received the product!","I ordered this item and never received it. It was on back order for about a month, but when it did not arrive I contacted the seller. I was told it was sent and they ""have no idea why I didn't receive it."" I was credited my money back but it seems that this item should not be offered if it is not available. Today, I still have not been able to find this album, anywhere!"
2,A Travesty,"This is a dazzlign work -- it also vile, gratuitous and unnecessary; while I would never forbid its printing (after all, it isn't ""Mein Kampf""), I would suggest to anyone searching out a pastiche or two of the Great Detective to avoid this overwrought ungentlemanly exercise of the imagination; it is not (nor will it ever be) the last Sherlock Holmes story; no one of any sensibility (or who loves the Master) would wish it so; to imagine Sherlock Holmes as Jack the Ripper (brought on by overuse of cocaine) is insulting to the reader and very dead end; Michael Dibdin is a fine writer; regrettably, he has had one egregious lapse in taste that will prejudice me forever against reading anything further he writes.Stick with Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr, Nicholas Meyer et al.; Holmes should be savored not trashed; ever."
4,Fallen Angel!,"Reviewing this work in itself is going to be a spoiler for future readers, so let me keep my posting as succint as possible:1. It is one of the finest pastiches that I have come across, with an element of honesty that tends to envelope you.2. It is a very painful work that saddens you to an extent that I considered impossible, before reading this work.3. Read it, but don't lose faith. If the Church can survive the entire gamut of conspiracy theories, we can also survive."
2,pretty good.,"pretty good book.thou I have read better ones.There's one by sir arthur conan Doyle's son thats interesting.I have ordered another one 'Holmes for the holidays'that looks promicing,for a fun mystery.I rate 2 stars to be fare. I am a sherlock holmes fane.Iam using the local library, elkins. there's only one library.I am not sure of the email adress."
2,Awful stuff,"If you don't mind seeing your high school girl friend on the pages of a girly magazine, then you might enjoy this book; otherwise, probably not. The author is certainly capable, but a skilled torturer is not really something I admire.As I progressed through the book, the idea of a declining Great Britain kept popping into my mind. When the original Holmes was doing his sleuthing a positive, an optimistic spirit was evident in the stories, whereas this version of Holmes evokes a tired, defeatist attitude that is the reflection of present day Great Britain, and the times, I guess."
1,"Holmes vs. the Ripper? Not here, friends.","Though this book is well written, and the characters are clear an vivid, it can be defined in just one word: PREDICTABLE Any reader with a bit of imagination can guess the identity of the Ripper in first 20 or 30 pages. And also, the novel sidesteps what should be the point of the story, for there is no real confrontation between Holmes and the Ripper. In addition to that, if you are a true Holmes fan, you will feel not only cheated, but angry with the ending. I'm still waiting for a REAL Holmes vs. the Ripper story, and it's not here."
2,"Well, that was...","...interesting.""I had rather be taken for a fraud, than have seen the many for whom Sherlock Holmes was an ideal and an example shattered and embittered on learning the horrible truth about their paragon."" Michael Dibdin's John Watson says on the last pages of this book. Sadly the author didn't share these feelings.While quite well written the book is unlikely to win any ""Best Pastiche""-awards, as the author seems to be among the fans who insist that John Watson was the ""real hero"" of the Sherlock Holmes canon and sets out to prove his point by utterly ruining Holmes' reputation.Certainly an arguable take on the matter and the author is within his rights, but this SH-fan is unlikely to reread this tale within her lifetime."
1,"Save yourself, do not read or listen to this (purported) book.","I think I am going to sneak into the library and insert a note in the CD box for the next borrower/listener to immediately return the CDs and get something, anything else, to listen to.By all measure, this is the worst book I have listened to/read in 10 years. There is a decent plot, to start. Then it makes a mockery of Sherlock Holmes, Watson, his brother and the wonderful Holmes literature.Worst of all, it leads one, with several red herrings, to even doubt the author's mean-spirited ending.There are FAR better books about Sherlock Holmes out there. Do not waste your time with this one."
1,Holmes a murderer - please?,This certainly does not encourage me to read other tomes by Michael Dibdin. The story as imagined does nothing to enhance the Holmes legend and only perverts. It takes the character's flaws that make him human in Doyle's works and makes poor old Holmes an inhuman monster. Take any well known fictional character and alter the characteristics we love best and you no longer have the character. In essence this is what Dibdin did which ultimately makes the story an exercise of the authors wit or lack thereof and not about the character we have grown to love.
1,Upsetting,"I figured out very early on who the Ripper really was, and it upset me. This book will shake most Sherlockians to the core. I really don't recommend it unless you like having literary characters treated in this fashion. I you want a pretty decent Holmes vs. Ripper story, try _The Whitechapel Horrors_ by Edward B. Hanna."
1,Unsatisfying ...,"Not a great contribution to the 'Vintage Crime' series for Random House. Dibdin pits Sherlock Holmes against Jack the Ripper in a ""shocking"" tale that takes the most obvious plot option to accomplish the task. The subsequent text just manages to keep you muttering ""please get on with it"" because you never really doubt where it is going to go. But, mercifully, a short book."
2,"Brilliantly Written, But...........","I cannot deny that this novel is effectively written, and was difficult to put down. Nevertheless, with hindsight I have to take note of how Dibdin resorts to some fudging of the Holmes canon to fit his square peg into the round hole of his seemingly ingenious payoff. The one fudging he can't be allowed to get away with is the total absence of the character of Mycroft Holmes from this story. I would have had a lot more respect for his unorthodox conclusion that admittedly is an outrage for true Holmes fans had he found a way of working Mycroft into the story. It soon becomes patently obvious after reading this story again that Dibdin has to pretend Mycroft doesn't exist in order to make his story and his theory fly. And that's something he really should be called to the carpet for when analyzing his story construction, and not just the simple visceral anger one might feel over the outcome itself."
2,Not what I expected,"Not a good Sherlock Holmes story. The novel is very predictable... If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan I would not recommend this novel...if you want a good Holmes/Ripper confrontation than read The Whitechapel Horrors by Edward Hanna. Much, much better than The Last Sherlock Holmes Story. END"
2,"Good writing, bad ending","I've read several of Michael Dibdin's books and was looking forward to reading this one. After I finished it, I just couldn't believe the ending! I kept expecting one more plot twist to explain away what I was reading. He did a nice job of reviving Holmes and Watson in Victorian London but I just couldn't buy his ""unmasking"" of Jack the Ripper. No way"
5,Not for the Stodgy-- All Others Will Love It,"Holmes fans who enjoy ideas and narratives not strictly adhering to the tenets of The Canon will enjoy this clever pastiche. Dibdin has done an excellent job of incorporating Holmes' and Watson's well-known personal traits, elements from the stories, and historical particulars from the Jack the Ripper case to fabricate a truly jarring and compelling tale.As you see in the ratings above, this is love-it-or-hate-it stuff, and if you worship Sherlock and can handle the unconventional, you'll appreciate this excellent work. I found it un-put-downable."
4,An inversion of sorts,"This is of course an offensive book. For a true Holmes fan, it is utterly painful. Yet as a mystery/detective story, as an exploration of a well-known character beyond the reserved, frigid facade conceived by ADC, it is also utterly brilliant. Well-written, well-paced, with good twists and snappy dialogue (some of it out of character perhaps but still quite clever), it succeeds as a novel. It is not likely to be included in the Baker Street Canon. It is not the latest epistle of the Holmesian Vulgate. It is simply very good."
1,There Are No Words...,"This book absolutely disgusted me. Not only does it butcher the good name of one of the most outstanding and honorable figures of literature, but it is written with such precision and detail that you can almost imagine the words are Watson's! While this would otherwise be commendable, here it only serves to deepen the betrayal.If you seek a true-to-Canon pastiche, I recommend Nicholas Meyer or Loren D. Estleman. Please, for your sanity and your stomach, steer clear of Dibdin."
2,This cd leaves some to be desired,"On this cd Danny Wright stubbed his toe a little bit. I have other cds by him that are better than this one.For this cd Danny choose an average repertoire and not nearly enough household name songs. I would have preferred more songs that I knew and liked, than the ones that are performed here.Danny did a good job of playing on this project. He seemed to know his material.Recommendation: I can not give a buy signal for this cd."
2,Poorly Researched and Heavily Biased,"While there is evidence of research, there's much more opinion than fact. Ms. Leon continues her series of Uppity Women books with the same style and humor, but it falls flat in the face of glaring errors. It is obvious from the text that Ms. Leon has very strong views on religion and men. Unfortunately for the reader Ms. Leon wasn't able to set her own opinions aside to tell an unbiased story.The book is littered with misrepresentations, disparaging remarks, and an insulting brand of sexist humor that makes Woman's Lib and intelligent women everywhere look bad.On the other hand, if you can ignore the playground tactics, this isn't a terrible book. The history that is right is worth the reading (although not at the current Amazon listed price of $28). It's a good starting point for serious research, or as a gift for someone with a quirky sense of humor."
4,A sweet love story,I really enjoyed this book. Luke and Cassandra's story was very sweet to read. It was also sad. I had a hard time believing that anyone could be as naive and innocent as Cassie. I also got really mad when Luke set up the Zerek men to go to jail. Other than that I really enjoyed the changes Luke went through to learn how to love and I thought it was a great ending. Defenitly worth the read!
2,Saccharine Sweet (and DUMB) Heroine Ruins Story,"This book was a total disappointment. I generally like my heros a little dark and tortured, so I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, the heroine totally ruined the story. She was so saccharine sweet - she was utterly naive and always nice. I am sure deers approached her and butterflies flitted around her head. I would also classify her in the 'too stupid to live' category. She was not a good match for the hero. Don't waste your time with this one - read To Have and To Hold for a dark hero/forced relationship romance!"
2,What Language!!,"This was the fifth book I read by this author. Since she was relatively new to me, and I LOVED the first four, I was dying to get my hands on as many of her books as possible. How I wish I hadn't. I thought the plot was okay, the heroine really got on my nerves, and I just wanted to smack the hero. But the main reason for giving only two stars was the language. I am not easliy offended by harsh and sometimes vulgar words, but this was insane!! I am only 24 and definitely not a prude, but there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I had to literally force myself to finish this book. I know, I know---why finish it if it was so bad. Well, I didnt want to waste my money. By the time I got to the end, I felt a little dumb for having subjected myself to the filth. I will be extremely careful about choosing her books in the future."
5,handy,Nice little reference (134 pages) packed with word roots and their definitions - adds a little poetry to the scientific names we come across in insects and others
2,A Quick Reference at Best,"It's the size and thickness of a small pocket index of truck stops across the U.SIt was useful for my Animal Diversity course in learning and remembering Latin genis and species names, but even still it lacked the terms and definitions used for even common animals. But at the same time it did have Xiphius Glidius (A sword) (sword)....Keep this book in your back pocket as a quick reference if you encounter law at frequent yet random moments that don't warrant a large text book or fancy gadget. Whether you are in the medical industry, or law."
4,Dictionary of Word Roots and Combining Forms,"This is the first book of this kind I have found, so I don't have much to which to compare it. It seems to be pretty good, but not entirely complete, from what I can tell."
1,Dictionary of Word Roots and Combining Forms,"This book is not helpful at all, and a waste of money. I was told by a fellow student that it was the greatest thing to keep in your pocket for a quick reference. It does not even go near being helpful. If Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary came in a paperback form to carry around, I would be interested.-Allied Health Student at MCC"
5,Savor science presented at its poetic best,The hardcover edition of this book (What is Life? by Margulis & Sagan) is a treasure in my extensive library. Clever writing and beautiful photographs bring out fascinating ideas. This is a book to be savored.
2,Adaptive ink pen,"While this would be an excellent prototype, it really doesn't serve the purpose very well for what I needed."
4,Quite good,I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan so this video holds a special place in my heart. This fills the void of information on Dr. Watson in an impressive way. They hit the ball out of the park here.
4,Great for the true Sherlock fans,"Being a true Sherlock Holmes fan, I enjoyed this video a lot. There are some great film clips here and they really go in depth. I woiuld recommend it to my fellow fans."
2,HISTORY GONE WRONG,"This was not a story or interesting material, it was more of a film history lesson Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, DR Watson. It would be great for a film history class at a university. Interesting for the first 15 minutes then it went down hill. This is the second video I have bought that were not as advertised. If you have the money has time to waste go for it."
1,Don't buy them,These books suck. Maybe they work I don't know but they aren't standard beginning piano lessons. They are primarily graphical using pictures of the keys not notes.
3,Nice music yet reading approach is confusing,"The pieces in this book are nice and the notes are big. I think it is more appropriate for younger learners. The introduction to notes on the staff is rather confusing. I tried this method for the first time with a student several months ago. She has completed book 1 and still struggling with reading notes on the staff. The only note she recognizes is middle C. I need to supplement with other materials to help her reading music. I think this book is better be used as a ""bridge"" after a student learns notes from bass clef F to treble G. I would recommend using the Music for Little Mozarts book 1&2 for children ages 4-5 and John Thompson's Easiest Piano Course book 1 for students age 5 up before using this book."
1,bad purchase!,The cover was completely off the book and the whole book is written and scribbled in. Very disappointed!!! Will not use this distributor again. Boo!
4,Three's a Charm for Alex Ubago,"I really enjoyed this album. Although there are a couple of songs that aren't that great (Reinas de la fiesta, Como en los Suenos), most of the tracks are catchy and just really awesome. My favorites are ""La Estacion"" and ""Sigo Buscando."" If you liked Alex's first two albums, you're definitely going to dig this one."
5,"A wonderful, addictive surprise","As one who has taught literature for many years, I must say thatDavid E. Kelley has 'out-Shakespeared Shakespeare'. Kelley has combinedcomedy, tragedy, history, human emotions, triumph, failings. . .Huzzah!!Overheard: ""A BOSTON LEGAL fan has to possess much more than an averageI.Q.""About that I do not know; however, those involved in this offering surely must have."
1,Defective Disc 7 ?,"...based on technical disc difficulties.Ironically, there appears to be an issue with Disc 7...containing the last three episodes and the Special Features. A number of customers who have made it to the last disc find the episodes filled with pixel noise. The screen menus work fine but the actual episodes won't play properly. Replacement sets from Amazon exhibit the same trouble, so it's a manufacturing problem.It's going to be a long, cold Winter."
1,Boston Legal 2,I ordered this and all went well with delivery time wise and all but the product was faulty on disc 7. I requested another copy and Amazon sent another copy to me. Unfortuneately the second copy came to me with the same faulty disc 7. I tried to re-order and they told me product had a problem and would not re-send another copy to me.There is a problem with two episodes on disc seven.
2,subtitles,I am elderly and have some hearing problems. I bought the episodes that had ENGLISH subtitles. The second season does not.
5,dvd,"dvd is in excellent condtion, as i imagine it would be... have done business with this company in the past, and they are awesome!"
3,Boston Legal Season 2,"I love the series. There is a problem with disk 7 - the first and third episodes pixelate and are unwatchable. I asked amazon to send me a replacement, unfortunately the same problem has occurred again. I suspect a manufacturing problem. Does anybody have a disk 7 that works?S."
5,Boston Legal Season 2,Great... I'm a big Boston Legal fan and season 2 was a refresher. Always a good show.
1,Liberal BS,Could have been acceptable w/o the Liberal Agenda Hype.Give me a break. Give everybody a break!I will not watch any more of this trash.
1,"Season 2 is disgusting, Season 1 was outstanding!","Throughly enjoyed season 1, five stars! What happened to the writing in season 2. Seems Kelly just had to put in his far left political agenda over and over and over. OK fine. I can deal with that, but when he chooses to explore disgusting perversions, disguised as network entertainment (did they really air this), well enuf already. We watched the first two disks in 2 hours. Does it improve any after that?"
3,second season syndrome,mass chewing of scenery in massachusettes....hammy and fun tv series lacking something from the fantastic first season...shatner and spader still a terrific double act but the writing seems to have less bite and way more silliness.
5,Boston Legal 2,"I tend to forget how great the writing is for this show. Great comedy with that touch of ""message""."
5,Best Show on TV,"There's nothing like it. You'll have a great time enjoying this series. It's meaningful, hilarious and well-written."
4,"More ""Preachy"" Than Season One","Every plank in the liberal agenda platform is represented in this season, but I still watch the show. If you are a strong supporter of ""Red"" state beliefs, this show may not be for you.As for defective disk 7, a previous reviewer made reference that most of these were found in sets that had a 2-digit code of ""20"" above the bar code on the back of the box. At first ""20"" was all I could find. I finally found one with ""50"" and purchased it. All disks played fine."
3,Quality of product,"I recieved a copy of Boston Legal 1 & 2,and watched the first series with a great amount of enjoyment.I started to watch the second series and had a problem with the first dvd, so proceeded to watch the next thinking it was just the one dvd, as it turned out the whole series was corrupted. My partner and i put it down to faulty or, less than desireable quality dvd's that the series was copied onto.I complained to amazon and they responded extremely promptly and replied with sending me out a whole new series free of charge.I am currently waiting on the series to arrive, not from an extended period though, i just wanted people to be aware of what has happened, when i recieve series 2 i will keep people informed of the progress.I am not unhappy with the series or the shows at all, but was dissappointed as i was all set to watch the next series and found the whole series corrupted.Amazon have responded with a great amount of speed and proffesionalism."
5,kelley the greatest,"Season 2 is even better than the first. Kelley is a genius. I guess the Prix Nobel de la Télé (TV Nobel Prize) does not exist ? It's urgent to create it, and give it to David E. the greatest. Anyway, Alan Shore, Denny Crane and the gang are my best friends for 2006. Enjoy ! Wyatt Earp (Brussels)"
1,BAD disc 7 problem LOOK HERE===>>>,"To everyone who has the infamous problem with Disc seven of Season two..you NEED to call Fox Entertainment @ this number 1-888-223-2369. The more people they hear from about this problem the faster there will be a recall & this problem will be a thing of the past. I called & they picked up immediately, she took my complaint & said it was the first call about it because the DVD set is so new. EVERYONE must call now to get another case file / email started so they will take notice. If you own this set or plan to...regardless of wheather or not you know of this problem, PLEASE CALL! help get this fantastic show's box set back on track. I promise you this WILL WORK if you do something about it...they simply just don't know about this problem, plain & simple"
1,Disk 7,Disk 7 of this series is defective. I ordered a replacement and the problem was identical. This is NOT a marginal problem. I tested the DVD on 3 DVD players and 4 computers. All failed completely on the last episode...and partially on one earlier episode. Stay away from this set or you will be very dissapointed to not be able to view the season finale.
5,Hilarious!,"Boston Legal is my favorite T.V program by far! The characters are well written and acted, and the episodes always have me laughing. It's just Brilliant! More T.V. should be like this!"
5,"Well written series, well worth watching.","""I can't believe I'm here. I make over a million dollars a year and I'm in a basement looking for a dead midget."" Shirley SchmidtThe characters are well developed. They come and go from episode to episode, woven into the fine fabric of the series. The writing is terrific. One needs to watch and rewatch each episode in sequence to catch all the subtle humor in the incidental comments, despite the fact that each episode is thoroughly enjoyable as a stand alone.Watch and enjoy the thought provoking humor skillfully played out."
2,Too slanted a study.........,"Anybody who buys an Osprey book is most probably buying it for factual information. In terms of the illustrations and basic info. this book is fine. The only thing that threw me off was the authors constant anti-soviet rhetoric.The war is over now, and I think the publisher should really put out a new edition of this title, sans the western propaganda and a little more information on the weapons and tactics of the soviet forces and the mujahedeen."
4,Dated but worthwhile,"This Osprey title was written in 1986; therefore it lacks any objective overview of the war from start to finish. It is, however a good source of basic information on the war up to that point. The color plates by Ron Volstad are excellent. The author makes several good points, especially noting the friction between various Afghan ethnic groups. You didn't think it was all about religion, did you? After reading this, one wonders about the wisdom of the U.S. involvement there...England and Russia have already been down this path!"
3,A Convenient Reference,"This book is exactly as described by the author, legible and easy to read. While nearly all of the content supplied is available free on Google ebooks and Kindle, this is the only collection available in print.If, like me, you prefer to have a printed book in your hand verses an e-reader or laptop then you too will find this a convenient reference in your library. My copy is highlighted with notes in the margins, as are all of the references in my library.Though, I did not hesitate to buy this book, I gave this a three-star rating because of the sale price."
4,CONFEDERACY'S WEAKEST ASSET,"A MAJOR INOVATION IN THE CIVIL WAR WAS THE STRATEGIC USE OF RAILROADS ON BOTH SIDES. THE CONDITION OF THE SOUTHERN RAILROADS AFFECTED BOTH THE CONFEDERACY AND THE UNION IN THIS WAR. DIFFERENT GUAGES OF TRACKS, WHETHER THE TRACKS RAN NORTH AND SOUTH OR EAST AND WEST WAS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. THE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE CAPTURES OR DESTROYED ROLLING STOCK AND RAILS WAS A MAJOR FACTOR. IN THIS WORK BLACK ENLIGHTENS US TO THE PROBLEMS AND PROGRESS OF THE CONDEDERACY'S RAILROADS AND GIVES US A CLEAR PICTURE OF THEIR OPERATION AND MILITARY VALUE. A BOOK WELL WORTH READING."
2,Decent if You're Unfamiliar with the Mystics,This book is pretty bare bones. It's mostly made up of light historical accounts of great mystics of the past. I found it very dry. Not much of the mystic's actual teachings are covered. It all feels more like a term paper than a rich compilation. I recommend this instead if mysticism is what you're into:An Anthology of Christian Mysticism by Harvey Eganhttp://www.amazon.com/Anthology-Christian-Mysticism-Pueblo-Books/dp/0814660126/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1297659973&sr;=8-1
1,I could not stand it,"Already I knew after just a few page, that the words """"disgusting"" and ""unmotivated"" were ones of the favorite of the author. He uses them EVERYWHERE, he keeps on repeating himself and whining, I could not stand it. I had to fight myself to finish reading this book and what a waste of time..."
5,Haters Get a Life! GET A LIFE!,"Maybe you oh-so-hip ""cool"" *ssholes should take a break from reading Chuck Palahniuk or Brett Easton Ellis (or whatever corporate America tells you is ""cutting-edge"")-- and actually READ a REAL book before you review it. A book you pick on your own! If you can handle making your OWN CHOICES!Case in point with this book: Little New York Bastard -- okay, it's different, it's challenging. So what. You can't handle that?Still gotta read Palahniuk or ""dark"" authors to prove you're cool? To prove you're hip? Oooooooo, you're SO ORIGINAL!Gutless, corporate-controlled robots -- do you even realize how much corporate America shapes your opinions?! Read something on your own! Make up your own mind, for once! Start with this NON-CORPORATE BOOK! Support REAL literature, the REAL cutting-edge!"
1,Misery Loves Company,"After reading fifty pages of this paranoid, schizophrenic, homophobic, pointless memoir, I understand why Dylan Raskin doesn't give interviews; or rather, I understand why no interviewer will interview him. This man has serious issues and I'd be afraid to sit down and interview him myself, or I just wouldn't waste my time.This book is sloppy and even by page 50 you won't notice a point to it. I suggest giving up after that, as I did.At least we know Mr. Raskin is keeping good company. Blabbermouth.net reported that Raskin was seen having lunch in New York with another washed-up, homophobic, schizophrenic hermit who everyone has forgotten about - Axl Rose from Guns N' Posers. I'm sure they had a nice chat about how much they hate the world. I guess misery really does love company."
3,I gave it a shot......,"o.k., I purchased this book upon recommendation via this website.I was able to totally sympathize with the characters angstbecause I feel it myself, however, I kept waiting and waitingfor something to happen. I found myself reading faster so thatsomething would happen, and it did'nt. I was bored to tearswith the mundane details and I understood every detail becauseI've been to the towns Mike referred to and have walked down thestreets and in the parks that he talked about.I spent most of the book eyeballing the other stack of good books resting on my nightstand, waiting to be read.The animosity expressed in his language throughout the booktoward other human beings was almost intolerable, although I'msure he was just trying to get that ""N.Y. thing"" across -perhaps that's why I have no desire to go back there. Chicagois the best city in the country anyway......."
1,BIG NEW YORK A$$HOLE,"Dylan Raskin,You know what? I can't understand what the f**k all the hype is over your book. Every book store in NY has it in the front of their store like its the new ""thing"" book...and nothing can be further from reality because honestly your book blows donkeys. I'm ashamed of myself for having bought it and contributed to your wealth. Just some FYI Dylan Raskin, I f**kin quit after page 20 because all you do is whine, whine and more whine about every f**kin thing and you know what? No one cares! Get a damn life and learn how to spell properly and while your at it get a real job and stop vomitting in the footsteps of writers who were eons better than you ever were or will be. No wonder you run around yelling at people, you suck and you know it. Your country begs you not to publish another book."
5,This book is a must read for all men.,Do you know how your wife/girlfriend trapped you? Anton LaVey knows. LaVey the all-time master of human nature reveals secrets every successful woman should know. More than a How To Catch A Man book. A lot more. If you thought The Satanic Bible was good; you will love this. This is the most devious and crafty thing I have ever had the good fortune to read.
4,Great album from an all too overlooked performer.,"I'm new to Chris after seeing him live, solo. He is absolutely captivating live. There's not quite as much magic in the studio recordings but they are still great. The title track is especially nice because he's added very little to it save for some backing vocals which sound more at home with each successive listening. ""Origin of Species"" is one of my all time favorite lyrics. Bottom line is Chris is a wonderful songwriter and a great performer. If you ever get the opportunity to see him live, don't miss it."
5,Lovely as Chris Smither always is...,We were so pleased to get Chris' latest and as we had hoped the cd is Terrific. He's a great guitarist and somehow his lyrics tells stories that allow us in to know more about him...a great story teller. This is our 7th Chris Smither cd...he's incredible.
5,"Blues, with a sense of humor","I love this CD. It's hard to write a review that doesn't make this sound less than it is, it's that good. Smither's writing has never been better, and his covers-- Cold Trail Blues and Visions of Johanna-- bring a whole new beauty to each piece. My favorite is the title track; it's catchy, tightly written, warm, full of understanding and that touch of humor that distinguishes Smither's work. I'm with him on Origin of Species (like I am on Train Home.) They draw such a gentle line between where we can be sure of ourselves and where we probably shouldn't. And after listening to Smither sing the blues, I always feel like trying again."
4,An excellent timepiece,"This is a soundtrack to the documentary ""Elvis That's the Way It Is."" The album was a modest hit when it was released in 1970 peaking at 21 on the US album chart (number 8 on the US Country chart) and 12 in the UK. It would be certified GOLD by the RIAA. The documentary covered Elvis' concerts in Las Vegas. It includes both live recordings from the show and ""studio rehearsal"" recordings. It includes the US hit single ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me"" and the UK hit single ""I Just Can't Help Believin'"". While it is a little lite on the number of songs included (it is just a reissue of the LP) it is still an excellent collection and a must for Elvis fans. Elvis is in top form for these recordings."
2,Dissapointing,"The album does not reflect the soundtrack. Compared with the live versions, the studio performances pale into insignificance and do not do justice to the actual performace. I can't understand why the versions from the film were not released - I rarely listen to this album as the song versions are inferior."
1,LCD Pannel Meter,Never did get this product to work. Called supplier and never got a answer. Throw it in the garbage . Will not go that route again.
3,Precalculus: graphs,"This book needs more detail example for the problems. Furthermore, not only to the example but more info about the topic it's explaining."
1,Outdated,"Not worth my time to sort through all these sites, when many are already outdated. I need more current information."
2,misstep,"I got this cd used for 2.99 and I am glad I got it for that price. Since this is out of stock at most places, don't waste your money on the import, it is not worth it. Wallinger was taking his musical ride without a rudder on this one-there just is no focus. Any of his other discs, in this order, goodbye jumbo, private revolution, bang, and dumbing up would be better than this...nothing really stands out..........This was only a misstep in 97 that has been overcome."
5,Quite possibly World Party's best album.,"Goodbye Jumbo is often referred to as Wallinger's finest hour, but Egyptology is well worth your time and attention. The song-writing is superb, the Beatle references abundant, and there's even a foreboding, Dylanesque track that takes you deep into a mummy's tomb for a lesson you may not be ready for...And if that's not enough, there's more.While I will concede that 'She's the One' is among the most beautiful love songs ever written,'Hercules' is the show stopper on this album. Like many things that catch us off guard, this song arrives in medias res, projecting the wearied voice of one who has lived through hardship, the voice of one who has come back to tell the tale. It is a brutally stark song, one that lifts you up and out of your stupor, sharing a powerful yet simple message of self-preservation that may seem obvious but bears repeating nonetheless."
3,YES IT'S HITCHCOCK! BUT A FAR CRY FROM HIS BEST!,"It's very hard to put down any movie by a director that has done so much for the industry as Alfred Hitchcock has. 'Torn Curtain' has all the ingredients to make a great film, but it fails, at least to the point that it is not one of his best films! It's a good movie that could have used some help in the editing room. It's got a great cast, but Newman and Andrews seem out of place in this sometimes tedious yarn of espionage. Although the one murder scene seems awkward I applaud ""Hitch"" for making a realistic murder scene where ordinary people are forced to kill someone and they might not do it in a efficient manner.The DVD I watched in from the Box set and it has a nice crisp DVD transfer and audio. The features are interesting and well worth a look."
4,Torn Curtain,"Sure, the chemistry with Paul and Julie isn't the best (nor is her wardrobe)but I enjoy this movie every time I watch it. Especially exciting is the bus sequence towards the end of the movie. Great suspense. This movie improves upon each viewing."
2,Delayed Action,"Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain is one of those pictures that you dont have to pause if you need to get up and get popcorn. In other words, if you can wait for real action and still pay attention to the so called ""boring stuff"", then this is the film for you. Then again, if you are like me,and just can't wait ten minutes to see an action-filled scene packed with drama, gore, suspense, ect... then I would not recommend this film to you. Bottom Line: Fast Forward and cut to the chase, but don't miss TOO much."
1,The Master's Worst,"Every genius is entitled to one fall from grace...& this is definitely Hitchcock's. Paul Newman(looking absolutely beautiful here)& Julie Andrews are shockingly miscast, the suspense is minimal & Hitch himself was obviously bored. For true auteurs, you all know what that means. We'll be bored too..."
2,A failed cold war thriller from the Master,"""Torn Curtain"" is one of the worst films Hitchcock ever made - a cold war thriller with no thrill.Paul Newman (playing a U.S. rocket scientist Michael Armstrong) hated the script and he and Hitchcock were at loggerheads on the set. Julie Andrews is hopelessly miscast in a ""serious"" role as Armstrong's lover/assistant.The nadir of the film is the killing of the evil Gromek, an excrutiatingly long scene in very poor taste.""Torn Curtain"" should be seen once by all Hitchcock completists but this film shows all the signs of a director who had lost touch with his audience."
2,JCParis,"As for Marnie and Topaz, this remastering of Torn curtain in 1.85 (a bit too larger for a 35 mm base film in ""flat widescreen"" format - 1.66 is most appropriate) is not to recommend for the ugly colors: flashy red, some colors faded, finally bad color balance. Why to try ""cooking"" the original colors?"
2,Bottom of Hitchcock list,I've watched two thirds of Hitchcock's movies. I rank Torn Curtain at the bottom. Very dull script and performances. Paul Newman seemed like he had no passion for the roll.
5,Fantastic and those blue eyes of Newman WOW,"Great Hitchcook and fantastic chemistry of Paul and Julie, Gthank You Lady Gigi This is Alfred Hichcook at his best without blood always trying to see what it is nest until the very end."
5,Hitchcock = Picasso,"Every Hitchcock is a masterpiece, but not every Hitchcock is popular.Torn Curtain brings to the screen the never-before-seen combination of Paul Newman and Julie Andrews in a spy story that can best be appreciated in the cold war intrigue that Americans lived from 1948 to whenever the wall came down.Alfred Hitchcock is an experimenter of the screen. Like a comedian that tries anything for a laugh, Hitchcock experiments with the tools at his grasp. At the time of Torn Curtain, he does not need money nor fame, so in a unique moment to free wheel, tells us about himself.It's worth the money, so put it in the collection as I have."
4,Ordinary story. Great directing.,"""Torn Curtain"" is one of the lesser known of Hitchcock's American films. And while it's not as great as some of his best work, it's still very well made and has that Hitchcock feeling. It's not a fast paced story, and a less capable director might have made a forgettable, somewhat dull, movie, but Hitchcock effectively builds tension between the characters (also helped by good acting) and creates several quite suspenseful scenes. You might say that the direction is better than the story and that some of the parts are better than the film as a whole. Still highly recommended to Hitchcoch fans and also recommended to fans of cold war/espionage thrillers.On a side note: Some DVDs are pan-and-scanned. Unfortunately mine was. Before buying the film, make sure you get the correct widescreen version."
2,"""Star Wars"" technology ahead of its time","Most amusing aspect is that Paul Newman, as a professor pretending to defect to East Germany, is out to steal Communist missile secrets -- anti-missile missile technology, in fact, that would eliminate the threat of nuclear war. Must have been one of Reagan's favorite movies."
5,great film,haha...its funny to see this dvd with a PG rating when an earlier VHS release had an R one!!! This is a great movie and reccomended to ALL Hitchcock fans.
3,"ALFRED HITCHCOCK, OPUS 50","As we are accustomed to always expect the best from Alfred Hitchcock, Torn Curtain may disappoint some viewers, It's also true that there is something that doesn't work in the film : the Julie Andrews - Paul Newman alchemy ? Or maybe simply because our heroes are not really in danger. Honestly, I dont know. I just accept the fact that it's not a masterpiece and focus on the great scenes of the film. Recommended."
5,loves it!,"great price, works as advertised. this is a vital part of my anti-aging regime, leading many people to assume I'm 10 years younger. Don't take too much, though. I find 25mg/day to be enough to keep vital without bringing out too much of the man in me."
2,Tears Easily,"The product does protect against any liquid I could throw at it but rips very easily and sticks to skin and clothing easily. Do not recommend if you plan on crouching at all.Also note that the zipper will easily come off if pulled too quickly. This model easily fits a male up to 6' 3"" and 250 pounds."
1,Lost Respect for Young Buck,"Damn... dis cd sucks... really, all I can say... Not some of his good stuff... G-Unit South is not really good... he should just stick with G-Unit"
4,Classic Zoinks!,"Panorama is a short and sweet EP, curiously missing the song Panorama fromWell and Good. If you like Zoinks! this is a great disc to add to your collection. It's worth getting for Ugly Side alone, and Chest Pain is a great track as well. Also, these are not the same recordings of Bridge Over Brautigan and Pedestal that are featured onStranger Anxiety--not vastly different from those versions, but there's some unique harmonizing here. Snowshine sounds like a wintery version of Thermalosis (fromBad Move Space Cadet), which is okay, but a slightly weak ending to an otherwise great EP."
2,"Misleading Title, no action","When I saw a book covering the exploits of Navy SEALs in Iraqi I thought it was far too soon for anything interesting to be declassified. I was very right. Mr Couch's book probably does the best job possible without offending Navy censors, but that still makes for a boring book. Less than 10 operations are covered, and even then many of the details were left out. The rest of the book is filler with information about training and command structures. Maybe in 10+ years Mr Couch will be able to write a more interesting book about Mid East SEAL operations when the information is released to the public."
2,Not what I hoped for,"Having read Linda Robinson's MASTERS OF CHAOS, I was thinking this book would be more along those lines. The author clearly has the inside knowledge and credibility necessary to write, but I found it bogged down in too many of his rememberances or references to his other books. While the stories of individual missions are interesting, there is little depth. It seems to rely on individual accounts of events, instead of meshing them into more of a cohesive story. That may just be my personal preference, but it's the reason I didn't like this book."
2,Recycled yawner..............,"While I have respect for Couch and his first excellent book on BUDS,the latest book ""Down Range : Navy SEALs in the War on Terrorism"" is full of filler and continues to recycle material from his last 2 books. ""Down Range : Navy SEALs..."" and has little in the way of action or anything new and interesting - save your money.I still recommend Couch's excellent first book, ""The Warrior Elite : The Forging of Seal Class 228"" as well as a new book by Reid ""Suffer in Silence"" a novel about BUDs (has it's flaws, but is gripping unlike the latest Couch book)."
2,Disappointing,I am a great supporter of our military people but find this work by Mr. Couch to be little more then a puff piece hardly worth the time to read. The Seals are a well trained force who don't need or deserve the gratuitous treatment that Mr. Couch provides in this book.
1,Big Disappointment,"I, too, bought this book hoping to read of the gritty exploits of these men in the war on terror. I was greatly disappointed.Couch spends the first 1/3 of the book going through the standard BUD/S and training phases diddle, he then goes on to relate the most superficial telling of battle anecdotes that never really say anything more than how great the teams are. He even spends time relating the 3 MOH accounts from the Vietnam War.By the time a person is interested in reading a book on Anti-terror Tactics they don't need to hear that ""Hell week is really cold"".It's obvious that Couch trotted this ""gem"" out on a weekend when he had nothing else to do, and clearly just saw the $$$ he was going to get for the effort.Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Go rent ""Navy Seals"" with Sheen. It is just as informative and a lot more enjoyable."
3,Depends on what your read first...,"If this is the first Dick Couch book read, it's a good one. Other people have commented that it seemed fluffy and not authentic (leaving out the bungling of bureaucrats and the inter-service rankling). I see that differently, I appreciate the way Couch focuses on the positive. There's no denying that those things happen but when you read Down Range, you get the best of who ""we"" are in this elite arm of the military. If you have read Warrior Elite or other Couch books, you will see plenty of overlapping detail. Bottom line: this is a good book by an author I really like, but not his best."
4,Hit the Target!,"A good companion volume to Couch's prior books, THE WARRIOR ELITE and THE FINISHING SCHOOL. A terific profile of the professionalism and heroism of special forces personnel who fight for our country and its interests. If you are interested in Navy SEALS and their operational deployment in the war on terrorism, you will enjoy DOWN RANGE."
2,SEALs are warriors,"Dick Couch is a former SEAL. He loves the SEALs. This book is a good look(although limited)at modern-day SEALs. If you have never read a book about SEALs then this is an excellent place to start. This book is very informative. If you have read alot or know alot about the SEALs then skip the first 38 pages. The author really loves the SEALs. Did I mention that? On one page alone(small pages) the word SEAL is mentioned 16 times. Dick Couch is a good, not great, writer and is very detailed and I was really enjoying his book until I read his account, on page 183, of a close-quarters firefight in which he describes how good these particular SEALs could shoot because they had shot the bad guys weapon and his hands holding the weapon. This may have impressed Mr. Couch or maybe he is just trying to impress the reader, but that is not good shooting skill. This isn't an old TV western. That paragraph really made me wonder about the whole book. Fiction? Non-fiction?"
3,Not up to snuff,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Warrior Elite"" and everything I enjoyed about that book was gone from this one. Dick Couch did a good job of making the trainees of BUD/S Class 228 personable, but ""Down Range"" is a very dry read. It might be due to increased security concerns and classified operational details, but I did not enjoy this book as much."
1,Boring,"this has to be the most boring book I've ever read. It was only purchased, because my kids school assigned it as summer reading."
5,The Dream Maker,The author's writing captivated my interest. It was as if I became a part of her real life experiences. I highly recommend this book to those who don't believe in miracles to read and share her experience.
1,extremely dissapointed,"at first I was happy but I felt it was made flimsy, the two pieces kept coming apart during use, now the inner workings broke and it doesn't work, it doesn't turn the shaft. I probably didn't use it over 10 times. A lot of money for nothing. I don't recommend it to anyone. Another thing, it only has (had) one speed."
1,Bad Gold Box purchase,"This was an impulse purchase from Amazon's Gold Box offers. Very cheap and with two fabulous reviews on file. This should have given me pause - just two reviews? Hmmmmm....Well, the box arrived and I set the contraption on the kitchen counter. I had a problem figuring out how to connect what with what. Because I kept thinking...it just couldn't be.... could it be....so HUGE!!!!!!!!? I mean, when you connect the power unit to the whisk, the whole thing is as long as a junior baseball bat. OK. Maybe not quite as long - but a good 20 inches, I'd say. I can't go back and measure the thing because it's all packed up ready to go back to Amazon, asap. Thank you Amazon customer service for giving me a refund."
1,Plastic-coated aluminum is NOT a good choice for food prep,"My older KITCHENAID stick blender has a plastic disc above the cutting blade. This falls into the blade path and gets shaved into our food. YUCK! The stainless blade also cracked, which makes me feel doubly threatened by the device. So I started shopping for a replacement.Amazon prices are good, even at this holiday shopping time of year, and the selection is broader. I bought the Kalorik because it is a smart design idea. HOWEVER, when it arrived we discovered that the blender attachment is made of ALUMINUM (can you say alzheimer's?) that is coated with plastic. The motor housing in the handle also looks like it will fall apart after just a few uses; doesn't seal up well at the seam.I RETURNED this one for full refund and ordered the Miallegro from Amazon instead."
4,Zoinks: The band for guys who secretly love their cousin.,"This cd rocks, just not as much as the previous two. In my opinion, the last two songs could have been omitted, but Zoinks always choose quantity over quality."
1,Do not buy this teakettle!,"I love the color and style of this teakettle, however, only after a month of use the enamel inside the kettle degraded and black paint and decorative metallic particles were leaking in my tea. I never abused it though! Highly disappointed!"
2,Rusts,"I rarely use it so it is dry most of the time. However, after a year, there is rust inside the kettle.Update: I contacted Le Creuset about the problem. I sent them my kettle. Two months after initial contact, I have a replacement kettle from them."
2,Pretty but poor quality,"The handle on the kettle is not connected very well and allows for a lot of ""bounce"" when you are lifting the kettle, traditionally instability is not something I look for when poring boiling water. Also, when you lift the lid you need to lift it from the top of the kettle and then immediately move it to the left or the right, since there isn't enough clearance (b/c of the handle) to remove the lid naturally.The color is nice and they did a nice job on the ombre effect. I expected more from Le Creuset."
4,Elegant Tea Kettle plagued by Shale,"It merits five stars for the appearance, but only three stars given the way it holds up for the price (I've used it for 4+ years). The care instructions say that excess water should be poured out between uses to prevent shale from forming on the inside. If you pay for bottled water or filtered water, you may not want to dump out unused water. But even if you empty it as instructed, I doubt it would prevent the interior finish from deteriorating. Towel drying the inside after each use may prevent those metal blotches that look like rust, but it's hot in there! Handle stays cool. No problems pouring or filling. Lid stays securely in place even upside down. Exterior is super easy to clean with soap. I'm likely to buy another just because of how lovely it looks on the stove. The Kiwi shade is to-die-for!"
5,Love it!,"I love this tea kettle! It's a nice size and it looks beautiful. I love the color! It doesn't drip when you pour it, which is a big thing for me! And the whistle isn't too loud or too quiet, it's just perfect!"
1,Do not buy,"I had this a short while also and agree 100% with the posted worst review. Without warning, the kettle keeps dirt and grease and the bottom is full of particles of the enamel burned off. It will give you the big D and stomach ache. The enamel stays on cast iron but not on steel."
1,Rusts so easily...waste of money,"I love the look of the Le Cruset kettles, but they all seem to rust within the first year. Not buying these ever again. They're more sensitive than Mogwai around water. That's really unfortunate when you're talking about a tea kettle. Avoid."
2,Not worthy of the brand nor the price,"The enamel is sharp-looking and the tea-kettle design looks really nice. I'm disappointed with the product because the plastic components such as the top handle, the handle-to-pot connector and the whistle housing are made of a cheap plastic and it shows as the plastic moldings are visible and really thin for a would-be long-lasting, sturdy product. The plastic handle also conducts heat so it's hot to handle. Also, Le Creuset branded the product with cheap sticker labels that come off in the dishwasher. It's not worth $50 bucks but it works well. Save your money and buy something without the sticker-branded labels."
4,Very pretty ... not a deep Cobalt.,This is a very pretty teakettle. It isn't quite as deep of a cobalt as I would like ... hence the four stars ... but still coordinates with my antique cobalt items. I like the handle and spout. The lid is tight and doesn't leak when pouring. It has a nice weight. I only use purified water in mine (since I intend to drink the liquid!) so I haven't had any hard water build up causing issues ...
4,"Solid construction with good fit all around, but","The only reason I wouldn't rate this five stars: the spout tends to allow water to run over and down the side of the kettle when pouring slowly. It's a difficult phenomenon to describe, but I'm sure most of you are familiar with it. You're pouring a liquid from one vessel to another and the lip is just not quite good enough to prevent some of the water from simply spilling over the side rather than pouring in a perfect stream. It only happens when you are pouring somewhat slowly, so it may not be an issue for everyone."
2,No what I expected.,"I bought this item because of the name Le Creuset and because it is usable with an induction stove. However, I was a little disappointed since when emptied, the water spilled all over the place. I did send it back."
5,Love this Kettle.,I love this teakettle. The weight is perfect. I have a induction stove top and the water boils in less than 2 minutes. Keeps the water hot for tea for over an hour. Great product!!
1,"terrible design, hard to use, rusts easily","Because of the angle of the spout and the placement of the insulated handle on this item, you have to be at least 6 feet tall in order to pour it comfortably. I'm short, and when I pour it using the insulated handle, I end up pointing my elbow at the ceiling. Very strange. I usually get a pot holder and hold it nearer to the stem.My husband bought me this tea kettle as a present, knowing that I love Le Creuset. I haven't had it very long (about a year) and it is already starting to rust. But I am glad, because I will be able to buy another tea kettle soon. It will NOT be a Le Creuset. Hard to believe that they made something so poorly designed and so shoddily built."
3,Fine for Perry Mason fans,"Perry Mason mysteries are all of a piece in my mind-fast paced, hightly repetive both from story to story and from chapter to chapter within each one. They're fun, and they go down easy. That explains Erle Stanley Gardner's life-long success and diminishing fame. The kindle edition I used had an inordinate number of typos. Thus I suspect that someone, not unlike Perry's creator, is out to make a quick buck without paying full attention to details."
1,Boom Bip Blah,"I recently listened to Blue Eyed after reading rave reviews. I was pretty dissappointed. Despite a few good moments, this album is repetitive, unoriginal and boooooring. The songs take much too long to progress (unless you are stoned) and the entire album sounds like it was created in Garageband.If you're looking for a CD to nap to, I'd recommend this album. Otherwise, move on."
4,Nice overview of the era,"This book was elegant, well executed, and easy to read. If you like the Regency era, you will learn more about this period and will enjoy so doing. I have little else to add, except that I have even more respect for George III now than I did before reading this book."
4,A relaxing ride,"Unexceptional but very pleasant entry in the British Rail Journeys series filmed in 1995. Plenty of scenery and occasional stops at historic sites, lochs and villages. Glasgow. Fort William, Oban and Mallaig are those places highlighted. The price is right for this railway ticket!"
1,Poor Quality,"Cheap, poorly made magnets.Magnets fell off of plastic after a short time. They also didnt have a stong enough mangnet to hold thicker papers to my fridge."
4,"""Coyote"" is fun and sad at the same time.",Coyote is a movie about 2 guys who start out with a good-hearted reason to help immigrants cross the border but then become greedy. Surprise ending!
5,The Way Home,I like all of Irene's books and this story was well done especially the characters and the interaction. It was very hard to put down.
2,Boring,"Sorry, but I found this book to be rather boring. It contained page after page after page of deep introspection on the part of the two main characters,which is something I don't like. Along with very long descriptions of scenery, etc. Could not get into the book until about the middle, and then just as I thought it would pick up speed, it would slow down again. I like lots of interaction and dialogue between main characters, and this was really lacking. The relationship was not developed very well. I would not recommend this book."
3,Butterfield Overland Mail:,"I haven't had the time to completely read the book, but I found the area where the town and state I was looking for was found - San Bernardino, California: Sadly the original route was changed and instead of going to the town of San Bernardino they only went through the lower part of San Bernardino County which at that time was what is now Riverside County. So, basically the information I was hoping to find on the San Bernardino town area of that time wasn't there.But I'm sure there will be lots of interesting information about the trip across the country as I get to read more of the book.Any suggestions as to publications that might include information on San Bernardino and Colton, California during the 1800s?"
4,Good,The product is good and does the job it needs too. I thought it would be lighter though. Straps adjust.
5,Very Helpful!,"As an English teacher, I had tried to institute peer review into my classes but was never successful until I read this book. Brandvik provides 75 sequential writing lesson plans that built a writing community in my classroom. My students now know how to serve as peer editiors for their fellow students.A good portion of the book's assignments focus on narrative type writing though some space is devoted to poetry writing and word play. I was wishing for some of the lessons to focus on other modes--persuasive, expository, etc. However, after teaching a couple of units from Brandvik's book, I was able to apply her techniques to my own units. Her modeling was a good teacher!"
4,Sad Sack's Delight,"The first words you hear on this disc is ""I hate my life"". That sort of sets the tone for the entire album. So if that is not the subject matter for you, You best avoid this disc. But for those who are into sad-core, or slow-core music, this is a great album. Suprisingly, I find myself listening to this more than Massachuttess, Pernice's fine disc recorded with Scud Mountain Boys."
4,Quite A Find.,"Thanks Amazon for putting this on my welcome page, I got it for Christmas and I really enjoy it. Moody, depressing, yet beautiful. My favorite is the melancholy lullaby THE TWO OF YOU SLEEP."
2,"So, So, Boring","Have you ever listened to someone talking in a monotone voice? Everything modulated at a certain pitch which begins to lull you to sleep. This is what this cd does to me. This is a style of songwriting and playing that doesn't dare to do anything to push either the music or the lyrics into something interesting. It's not that Pernice's voice or playing is bad. But, he persists in a style that is utterly forgettable, relegating it to background music where you don't even care what the singer is saying because it takes too much effort to make out what the hell this guy is droning on about. Start drinking stronger coffee, Joe."
3,acid-on-tongue-in-cheek,"A pretty amusing little ""undercover agent meets the LSD underworld mystery"" that somehow manages to trade on anti-drug hysteria within the framework of a simple mystery formula. It's written in very simple prose but surprisingly held my attention until the end. It's cheesy, formulaic and probably sold more copies based on its sensational title and cover than anything; but it's pretty fun entertainment for a dark, rainy night in which you want to start and finish a small book. Gotta hand it to the author for doing something unique!"

1,Piece of Junk,Pump was broken when received. Rocket tip broke off on 2nd launch. Most is made of foam. The base can't stand straight because the air hose is not outweighed by the base. Poorly designed junk.
1,We really wanted to like this....,"...but the pump broke after we launched the third rocket. The rockets do launch very well and get great height, however there are a couple of things I wish I had known before I bought this. First, there is a small plasticky wafer that you must use to launch each rocket. One new wafer is needed for each launch, so you eventually will need refills. Second, the pump ( before it broke) is so small that it takes quite a bit of effort to launch the rocket. If you are going to buy this, look for the model without the pump and opt for a larger bike pump."
3,Not bad but not good,"Got this product with he pump. The pump is pretty well garbage. Leaks air all the time and does not have the psi to send the rocket very high.It is fun but don't expect to much.Overall good fun, i will probably have to make some sort of storage container for the air with a release valve to fire in the future."
2,very difficult to operate,The Putnam Hawkeye Fifth Wheel Head is very hard to use. The handle to lock/unlock the king pin does not move well. The 2 times I used it I needed a hammer to unlock it. It does not lock automatically like some others. I was very disappointed with the whole Putnam setup.
2,Don't waste your time and money,"I had to read this book for class and it was a complete waste of time. I don't understand why this guy is driving around the U.S. in a minivan if he calls himself an environmentalist and if he is so unhappy with the U.S., why don't he just move the Cuba. But besides the questions I have about this book, I still think it is not worth reading. He provides detailed descriptions of what he and his wife does on their trips like we should care. If you would like to know about a place's demographics, tourist attractions, culture, socioeconomic status, and so on, there is something free to everyone called the internet. Please do yourself a favor and forget about this book."
3,Diesel-vs-Shawn Michaels and Whatshisname-vs-Whatshisname,This WrestleMania was alright. Bret Hart-vs-Bob Backlund(who was in WrestleMania -127) w/ Roddy Piper. Jeff Jarrett defends the Intercontinental Championship against Razor Ramon. Diesl defends the WWF Championship against Shawn Michaels. Lawrence Taylor w/the American Football team(or something stupid like that)-vs-Bam Bam Bigelow w/the Million Dollar Corporation. Those are some of the better matches. The worse ones are Lex Lugie and the British Buttdog against two guys that are less known than Funaki(Jacob and Eli Blu). Owen Hart and Yokozuna-vs-? and ? for the tag team titles.
5,Diesel still Runnin on Diesel Power,"Well this Wrestlemania is one of the Best... mainly because of HBK vs Diesel a awesome match where Diesel looked out but got the shoulder upa nd jacknifed Shawn down... sure Shawn landed on his feet but the Rest of the match Diesel Killed HBK. Great Event i suggest all to buy it Razor vs Jarrett is great too the Bam bam vs LT was a joke but we all know what the REAL main event was.this was during the Good Ole Days of WWF when they had the Greatest World champion of all time, Big Daddy Cool, Diesel."
3,IT'S A ALL RIGHT WRESTLEMANIA.,NFL AND WRESTLING DO NOT GO TOGETHER.THREE GREAT MATCHS ON THIS CARD.BRET HITMAN HART VS BOB BACKLUND IN A I QUIT WASONE OF THE BEST.SECOND THE UNDERTAKER VS KING KONG BUNDY.AS TO WRESTLEMANIA 10 THE UNDERTAKER WAS NOT PART OF IT.IN FACT THIS IS THE FRIST WRESTLEMANIA WITH THE UNDERTAKER WEARING PURPLE THAN GRAY BACK AT WRESTLEMANIA 9 AND DIFFIRENT MUSIC.THIRD THE TITLE MATCH WITH SHAWN MICHAELS VS KEVIN NASH [DIESEL] WAS THE MATCH OF THE NIGHT. PS BUY NOT FOR THE NFL.
2,Wrestlemainia 11 review by ryan,The worse wrestlemaina ever. Only a few good matches and should be a IYH ppv not a wrestlemania. Dont buy this item
2,WRESTLEMANIA XI-NOT WORTH THE ANTICIPATION,"It was rather disappointing to see WrestleMania go weak for its eleventh installment. Perhaps the first ridiculous WrestleMania. The highly anticipated match between Bam Bam Bigelow and the NFL's Lawrence Taylor was the biggest upset of the night as LT pulled up a victory over Bigelow. WrestleMania XI should be recognized, however, as one of the few WrestleManias in which the WWF title did not change hands. Not all is disappointing about WrestleMania XI. Bret Hart pulled up an amazing victory over WWF legend Bob Backlund."
2,second worst wrestlmaina ever,this was one of the worst wrestmainia ever. ive seen everyone of them and this is almost the worst wrestlmania ever only wrestlmaia 13 was worse.the lex/bulldog vs. the beluha brother was horrible.razor/jarret for the ic title was average. the hart/backland match was watchable. the michals/diesel match was the best on the card. the taylor/bigalow match was pretty good. but definitly pass on this one.
2,WWF WrestleMania XI,"The worst WrestleMania of the 90s. There were some major duds on this card, including the Undertaker versus King Kong Bundy and Lex Luger and the British Bulldog versus Jacob and Eli Bleu. Bret ""Hitman"" Hart versus Bob Backlund in the ""I Quit"" match was decent. Shawn Michaels (as always) manages to carry Diesel to a good match, but they would blow that match away just over a year later at Good Friends, Better Enemies. As far as Bam Bam verus Lawrence Taylor goes, it was the best celebrity crossover match you'll ever see, but nothing special. Check out ANY other WrestleMania of the 90s."
5,"Simply put, beautiful","This book harkens back to Strands of Starlight. This is beautifully written. It lost some of its fantasy roots by taking place in the modern world, but none of that matters. Sandy Joy's journey to Elfdom is almost as good as Miriam's. Also, I am glad Natil finally found peace, as much as I disliked her in the previous books."
5,This Comp is THE BEST!!!,"From the ashes of the early 1980's Boston Hardcore scene emerged THE FREEZE, a totally unique, abrasive. and intelligent band that has stood the test of time better than all their contemporaries! This 30 song CD captures it all!!!"
5,India vs pakistan,Really good VCDS...and on time delivery.The good thing is the vision is like DVDS.Thanks
1,Disappointing -- No Crinkle at All,"Very disappointing. My grandaughter loves toys that make the ""crinkle"" sound. Despite the title, this does not, nor was it manufactured to do so. Rather, the ""Crinkle"" apparently is the name of the company that makes the toy. It was not remotely worth the $5 or $6 price, which came to over $11 with shipping. The baby is not interested in it at all. Plus, the orange ears that you see in the picture had to be cut off. I did not feel they were secured well and was afraid the baby would swallow them. I would have returned the toy, except the return expense was more than the product cost. In your search for teethers, skip this one."
4,Good exercise book to keep a child engaged,"If you value the power of the mind, then this book is many many times more valuable than a DVD player or iPod or game console. Either indoors or even for keeping the kids occupied in a car on trips."
3,Looks Do-Able but One Complaint,I probably missed some small print somewhere but these are little wall-hanging quilts. I thought I was getting a book about bed spread sized quilts. I could adapt them I'm sure but I'm an absolute beginner in quilting and I'll probably have to get another book to make sure I do it right.
5,PAY ATTENTION,"PLease pay attention to me. SAXON has three really worthwhile metal albuns, already considered classics. They are: ""STRONG ARM OF THE LAW"", ""WHEELS OF STEEL"" and ""DENIM AND LEATHER"". COming in minor league, ""POWER AND THE GLORY"" and ""CRUSADER"". AFter this, it's all garbage. This album has two of their best in just one package, it's a great thing to have it if you like traditional metal."
1,I WANT A REFUND!!!,"This book is not a novel. It is a collection of poorly written short stories with unrealistic characters. I can't believe this book got published! It is extremely short (which turns out to be a blessing), written in big type on very few pages. The characters are not developed well and are just a little to ""perfect"" to be believable. This is the type of writing you'd expect to receive from ""Ray-Ray"" the misunderstood inmate who wants to write fiction on the strength of his newly acquired GED. Kunjufu should stick to ""Conspiracy"" books which are his forte. If you want to read good fiction written by brothers check out E. Lynne Harris, Eric Jerome Dickey, or Colin Canner."
3,it's...ok,"I found this while looking for ways to strengthen my destroyed back (4 blown out discs, 2 with tears). The exercises are good, but the woman leading them takes so long in-between starting one exercise, and then ACTUALLY starting it, that I find myself holding the fast-forward button throughout the whole DVD. She keeps regurgitating the same nonesense about 'put a pillow here if it hurts' and she's got this droning voice. She gets you in position to start an exercise, then spends the next 4 minutes droning on about how it will go, which by then I've quit holding the position to wait for her to shut-up and start! kind of like that."
4,excellent exercises,"This DVD has very good exercises for alignment and balancing of the pelvis and hips. At first it does seem slow when compared to other exercise dvd's but really I need the break in between each set to rest and prepare for the next set because each exercise is actually a good deal more difficult if you really focus and use all the muscles. There are always certain muscles (ones which are not adressed on my regular exercise dvd's) which get stretched and strengthened after doing this DVD which I know are the ones which need to be stretched in order to straighten up my posture and body alignment.I bought this a few years ago because my left hip was ""messed up"" after having children and carrying them on my hip. I also do a lot of other exercise dvd's to recover from having the children. But, I would like to say that I was not able to really appreciate this DVD untill I did the ""Stretch Away Hip Pain"" DVDStretch Away Hip PainHope this is helpful."
4,Great gift for the Doctor in your life,"Bought this for our doctor boss as there is a running joke of ""World's Best Doctor"" in the office. The hardware (a nail) will not be enough to securely fasten this to a metal post. It is also a corrugated plastic and I hope that it will stand up to the weather."
2,One more step on a long road ......................,"In 1996, when this was released, Danny was a very good composer, but not such a great piano player. I find his playing here a bit theatrical, a bit pedantic, and a bit trilly. Yet I know those things are exactly what some listeners will like.The tune I like is ""Night Lights"" (3.24). This is a ""must have"" for lovers of good piano music. There is a sample at allmusic.com."
5,The Best Ever,The best Danny Wright CD ever. Cipolla is the finest composition I have ever heard! You cant' go wrong with this one.
5,Absolutely beautiful,"Received item within 2 days of purchase - although it may be because I live near where it was shipped. Bracelet is beautiful, sturdy and surprisingly light. It's the perfect thickness and looks beautiful on my wrist, I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,Beautiful Detail,This charm was purchased as a gift and we were very suprised at the detail that it had. My sister was delighted with the beautiful charm.
5,Inspired me to see the film.,"This is an amazing work. The tones, the compositions, brilliant. I listened to it on vinyl and had to get the DVD and this CD. Get them all!!! No wonder they edited the film to the soundtrack. This soundtrack and the film kicked in my obsession to westerns!!!"
5,Excellent speakers for serious listeners,"These speakers are dead serious, not the tinny ""home theatre"" junk that has flooded the market in recent years. The Celestions are perfect for Classical, Jazz or Rock music.....accurate and believable.Great sound, and great value."
4,B for Brillant,"The Bollweevils are brillant. This excellent release captures these Chicago natives during an intense live show. Sound is top quality without a scratch and the bass is really heavy. These guys are blessed to have a great vocalist. There are periodic breaks between and during the songs: Security beating up the kids, fans fighting, and band stops. The sixteen songs here, show you how a great live show should be:Intense,Raw,and Fun. Finale is a fanTastic song."
5,Great Slings,"Used for sport climbing in my local gym, they work as expected. Would purchase again. I need five more words."
5,Good utility climbing accessory,"Super lightweight and thin. Makes it easy to used triple looped or as a full 24in quickdraw. About 8 inches triple looped, 11 inches double looped, and 24 inches (well duh) unlooped."
1,Was Shipped the wrong size.,"I was shipped the wrong item. Worst part is it looks to be intentional, when I opened the packaging I noticed that the runner was shorter than expected but the label claimed it to be the size that I ordered(240C), I noticed that the label was not the original so I peeled it back and noticed that the original label showed it to actually be only 30C not the 240C that I ordered. I have contacted Amazon support, but no reply as of yet."
4,This DVD opened my eyes to how competitive junior sports can be,"I enjoyed the video. It gave me some insight regarding the competitive nature of amateur sports, even at the youngest of ages. I found the acting believable and the skating fascinating. It shows the viewer that sports can be ""dog eat dog"" even at the most junior levels. The video is well done, and the skating remarkable. I know we will watch it numerous times and continue to enjoy it !!"
3,Good movie,"Not one of the best movies,but it was enjoyable.The main actress, Michelle Trachenburg did a great job playing Casey. It has a good moral about believing in yourself and following your dreams. It's truly amazing to watch the figure skating in the movie. This is a perfect movie because anyone can watch it. Its only G. If you like girly movies, Ice Princess is perfect for you."
1,Paid for NEW but received OLD junk.,"I purchased this item to give as a gift. I purchased it NEW! However, when it arrived, it looked like a piece of old junk. There was not even any plastic at all around the DVD case. Obviously it was old and used. I can't believe that is what they sent me. Of course there are no apologies from Amazon. You are supposed to take up your time to contact them about it and then more of your time returning the item. This should have been a simple order to fill and they messed it up. This seems to be the new trend with Amazon. I really should stop shopping with them. As of late, every order is messed up in some way! Now I don't have the movie to give as a gift and I have to look forward to the hassle of returning this piece of junk."
4,WHAT A CUTE FAMILY MOVIE!!!!!!!,Ice Princess is a cute wholesome family movie that everyone in the family can enjoy!!!!!! Michelle does a wonderful job in the movie!!!!!! Its where she wants to be a ice skater and her mom wants her to go to college in Hardvard!!!!!! The performances are great and i love setting it really feels like you are on the ice skating rank with Michelle!!!!! If you haven't seen this movie yet then go and pick yourself a copy and pop some popcorn and you and the whole family can watch a cute and charming movie!!!!!!
1,Didnt want to see it but had to,"Didnt want to see it but had to. I had to see it because my girlfriend wanted to see it. I sat through it even though I didnt like it. And Im not a fan of ice skating. But anyway my girlfriend like it and I didnt but all that matters is she wanted to see it and she liked it. Next time I pick the movie and since I get in for free(I work at the movies) Im picking Sin City. It is a good movie for girls of all ages just not a guy movie. Kim Cattrall, Michelle Trachtenberg, Hayden Panettiere, Kirsten Olson, Jocelyn Lai, and Michelle Kwan are hot."
2,could have been better,"I thought that this movie was ok. But i have to admit that i was looking for a little more romance. It is a great movie if you were looking for some passion, or if you skate-which i don't.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a passion to fight for."
3,Better for Younger People,"Slow moving, mediocre acting. Not enough ice skating. I was disappointed. I guess it comes down to different strokes for different folks. It would be a good movie for kids 12 and under in my opinion."
3,Cute movie but.... (minor spoilers),"This was a cute movie but a couple things didn't make sense, such as that skating test being given as a group recital. Last I heard skaters are tested individually. Also, I realize standards of dress, makeup, etc. in competition have been greatly relaxed in recent years, but the way that skater Zoey looked still seemed a little too over the top!"
5,I love this film!!,This film is great. It just shows what people can do when they put thier mind to it. It is about this science geek who has to do a project and couldnt think of what t do it on and then watched a program and it was ice skating. so she decided to do it on figure skating she then thought she would apply herself to the project to make it feel more her but she becomes attached to figure skating and her taecher says she has talent but her mother hates figure skating and would never want her daughter to do it. She has an harvard interview and cant decide what to chose figure skating or harvard. Watch the film and find out.This filmI would recommend to all ages and sexes beacuse it is haert warming and makes you feel good inside and may even make you cry. I watched this film and since Im a dancer and everyhting I thought I would get the soundtrack cd and it was great so I would recommend you to get both!thanx for reading. Jacob
4,Just watch,"This is a good movie if you stop criticizing that she mastered a triple jump quickly, and bringing your arms together decreases inertia. Honestly, thats not the point of the movie, it's more about the go for the goal kind of stuff. It's not realistic, but so what?, it's good anyway. One flaw is,she doesn't wear the white dress on the front cover at all in the video. It's also good for kids around 12-13 because it isn't something like Barney or Ariel the Mermaid, but there is nothing inappropriate in it's content."
3,Good...not Great,It was an okay movie but I don't know anything about figure skating or physics to understand it fully. I didn't find the ending very good and it wasn't really extremely funny or entertaining. It was an okay movie though.
2,In Pursuit of Finishing the Book!!!!,"I was sorely disappointed with this book. Loved Vision of Light. Was looking forward to more of the same. In this Green Lion, Margaret didn't seem to be the star. She didn't talk to God but once, which is something which I liked in the first one. The whole ghost thing and the whole gang trapsing off to France . . . I couldn't stand it. Finishing this book was very painful. I finished it because I typically finish what I start, not because I couldn't wait to see how it ended. I would not recommend this book at all; I have serious doubts as to whether I should read Water Devil. If it's better than Green Lion, please let me know, because I do not want to waste anymore time."
5,Could Not Put This Book Down!!!,"Mr. King, I really enjoy reading your book. Its got everything - mystery, sex, humor and great characters, all rolled into one. It really was a great treat. Thanks!!!!!!"
3,FOR ALL OF THOSE OF US WITH MEMORIES OF THE FIFTIES,"George King has written a fast-paced, readable novel which has to touch the hearts of all growing up in the fifties. He has shown a nice style and interwoven enough mystery to keep the reader interested in turning the pages. Mr. King has a keen sense of character and a fine grasp of words that lends a sense of realism as the story unfolds. I didn't put the book down until I finished it because I wanted to know what happened to all of the characters involved. Good job, Mr. King. Glad I had the opportunity to read your book. I have a sense of knowing you a bit, because I couldn't help but think as I was reading, that George King's memories were being revisited through Jim. Am I right?"
3,Good suspense novel.,"I found this book entertaining. Blauner really knows New York City and it's clear he knows his characters. The book jacket copy is very misleading as to who the real Intruder is, but don't let that throw you off.. My only complaint is the ending was a tad melodramatic and a little unbelievable. If you're a suspense fan you could do a lot worse than this book. I'd recommend it"
3,A Put-Downable Book,"The Intruder was billed to be an ""un-putdownable"" book by Stephen King. I completely disagree. I expected to find a gripping tale of a family's struggle to rid themselves of a threatening individual. Instead, I was greeted with a lackluster story with bland characters caught up in the legal system as well as rehab programs. What a disappointment! Not only was it quite ""put-downable"", I had a hard time deciding wheather or not to finish it. I hope Stephen King thinks twice before putting his name on another person's cover"
2,Story revolves around only three characters,"This novel was just average and it took me forever to get excited about it. I finally started enjoying the last 100 pages. This novel has only three main characters and the plot is pretty straight forward. You have the lawyer and family being harassed by the Intruder and the handyman/mobster who comes to the aid of the lawyer. If you think you know the ending halfway through the book, you are probably right. If you like to read a lot of books, I recommend this one as a change of pace. I did buy Man of the Hour by the same author so I liked Intruder enough to read the same author. If you are choosy about your books, then skip this one."
4,STREET JUSTICE,"In this rather downer of a novel, Peter Blauner etches realistic and scathing portraits of a diverse cast: Jake Schiff, a power house lawyer who finds his life turned upside down by the invasion of a ""street Person"" with severe emotional problems; his wife, Dana, a psychiatric social worker whose involvement with this same person catapults her family into a vortex of danger; John Gates, the street person whose tragic past and dependence on drugs, spirals him into a maze of terror; Philip, a sly mafia man who insinuates himself into Jake's life and through a murder sets a path of irretrievable terror.Blauner has a deft touch in creating seemingly hopeless situations, and though he redeems himself with characters finally doing something right, it ends on a rather dim vision of the future of our characters.Well done but disheartening."
4,A real page turner!,"This was the first book I've read by Peter Blauner and it will not be the last.At one time, John Gates felt that he had it all, a family and job of his own. But after his daughter was killed in an accident right before his eyes he experiences severe depression. Soon, he finds himself unemployed and on the streets. He meets Dana Schiff, a psychiatric social worker and he's convinced that Dana is really his exwife. Soon John G. begins to stalk her family. Jake, her husband and also a lawyer, decides to take matters into his own hands to protect his family. Unfortunately, the decision he makes, could cost him his life."
2,"There have been better, there have been worse..","There is some originality in Blauner's subject matter. Blauners tale would have made an excellent low-grade, realistic,daylight horror short story. Unfortunately the desire for sensationalistic hero gets the bad guy takes over and spoils the read.The book begins with the thoughtful and sometimes heartbreaking description of the downward spiral of a train conductor into homelessness, then crescendos into the thrilling tale of a couple being terrorized by this man who has begun to fixate on them. Just when you think this story is going somewhere, Blauner adds in a stereotyped Mafioso in the mix for some bizarre reason and this ultimately takes the story in acompletely uninteresting direction.Overall, I believe the first half book is worth reading. Once mafia guy enters the picture - feel safe in closing the book and calling it a day."
2,Stephen King was paid off,"First, the write-up on the back cover of this book is definitely more exciting than the actual story. I felt like I had been deceived after reading this snore-inducer. This book is not about a ""malevolent stranger"" terrorizing a family - it is about a cardboard-character Mafioso terrorizing a family (and doing it slooooooooowly). This is nothing but a very blaw tale - flat characters, boring plot, stereotypical bad-guys. It wasn't completely awful, but there was nothing new or exciting to the whole book. Avoid at all costs."
1,Awful...,"I picked up this book to read during a long flight, and I am so sorry I did. It is supposed to be gripping and exciting, but all I did was yawn! And I read some 200 pages before I gave up. I always take books on overseas flights because I usually cannot sleep to save my life. I wish I had taken another-any other-book besides this one! That flight, I can assure you, was dreadfully long."
3,"Eh, It's Alright... (but there are much better ones to read)!","I was really looking forward to reading this book...the storyline is great but unfortunately, the characters never develop and the ""hero"" of the story stays remotely in the background, emerging only to make the correct decisions at critical times. I would love for someone to re-write this book using the same story but really flesh out the personalities of the characters...it was a good idea but somehow just didn't quite work."
4,Sucker for Georgette Heyer,"Read them way back when and was pleased to discover how delightful I still find them, especially in a trying time, wherein a good read with fun characters and a happy ending has been a cheer me up. This is not her best, but still well worth reading. The hero and heroine are not as well characterized as usual (there's not even a physical descrption of either) nor is the spark between them inevitable to the reader. Well, I suppose it is, because of course, that's how it must end, but the reason for it and development of it is not as clear as one would like. Still fun though"
2,The Reluctant Widow,"Poor editing has ruined what would otherwise have been a good story. There was hardly one page without a distracting spelling error. It would appear that someone has put the document through ""Spellcheck"" and selected words at random to fill the typograhical error spaces. This spoils the story and the results are bizarre. Hang em up by the thumbs I say for such destruction."
4,a delightful read,"I just finished this, my first Georgette Heyer book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If all her books are like this one, I'll certainly read them all. Enjoyed the characters, the plot was fun, a light mystery, and does a good job of taking us back into the regency era."
1,Could not invest in characters,"I am a big fan of historical romance, and Regency in particular. I found very little to like about this book. The plot does at least differ from the usual ""rake falls for unconventional girl"" that most follow. However I did not like the style of writing. The characters are very one dimensional and it is difficult to form any affection or interest for them. I appreciate that the author tried to weave historical events in to the everyday lives of the characters, but the authors way of unfolding and explaining these events was to allow the characters to recite tedious monologues--that went on FOREVER. In the end the book was so disappointing. This was my second book by this author and I don't see myself purchasing more of her works."
3,Romance?,"I love Georgette Heyer, and this book just didn't do it for me. The writing is still great, that can't be denied, utterly charming descriptions and dialogue. I think what got to me was the utter lack of romance here. There weren't even hints to suggest that a romance might be brewing, and I really felt that I was just going on faith that this was indeed a romance novel and I would be rewarded in the end for my perseverence. And I was, I suppose, but I really didn't get any warm and fuzzy feeling out of it. I wasn't reading it because I wanted to read a mystery novel, so by the time she got to the denouement, I was so starved for romance that I couldn't have cared less about the resolution of that part of the plot.In short, unless you are a die-hard fan of her style, I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain this one."
5,Wonderful Read!,"It was difficult not to devour this book in one sitting. The writing is lovely, the characters exciting and the story is delightful. I am anxious to read more by this excellent writer and great story teller!"
4,The Reluctant Widow,"I haven't read Heyer in years but I knew when I started this book what to expect. A light hearted, madcap romp with wonderful heroes, heroines and villans.This book is the story of Elinor Rochdale, who through no fault of her own becomes the reluctant widow of Eustace Chevriot, Lord Edward Carlyon's cousin.The book is a wonderful cozy mystery romance involving spies, traitors and skullduggery. There is some wonderful repartee between the very high handed Lord Carlyon and the very proper Elinor.There were some editing issues with this ebook unfortunately."
3,Reluctant widow,Romance is very slow. Good bits between brothers and also between widow and Nicky. Worth reading more than once. Faux villain is enjoyable. Will recommend to Bridget.
2,Not GI Quality,"On a positive note, this poncho is much lighter than the military issued model. I have not field tested this poncho, but I have serious doubts about the quality. Mine was missing one grommet. The color and pattern are okay, but somewhat lighter than the picture. This poncho may not be ready for serious use, but it's probably okay to stick one in your bug out bag for emergency rain wear or shelter."
1,not really rain proof,"I purchased this product thinking that it was similar to the one I used in the Marine Corps but this is NOT the same. The first time I used it in heavy rain it did not keep out the water. I started getting wet down my neck and down my back...not sure if there was a leak in the hood (i never found one). Anyway...it is what it is.Update on this...It was the seams around the hood that were leaking. I used some seam sealer (stuff used for waterproofing tents and such)and it seems to be better. Still, you would think a rain poncho would keep out the rain."
2,Not What I Expected,"Given the price, I guess I expected something a little more sturdy, or rugged. It's a lot thinner and lightweight than I expected. In fact, it's not too hard to see through it with a little effort. Will it keep you dry? Yes! I had a slight problem getting my head through the top (and I know my head's not that big). But that's a good thing; you want it snug around the neck so water doesn't pour inside. I'm curious how long it'll last. It is huge though, and it should fit almost anyone and cover everywhere unless you're very tall or very obese. Personally I think it worth $10-15 at most."
2,Seems very disposable,"very thin and coloring seems really bright to be camo. I've never tested it. I keep it in my stock just in case i dont have the cheap $3 disposable green ponchos from wal-mart. I might use it some day, but no way am I carrying this for hunting purposes. it almost looks white"
2,Not as advertised,"I was looking specifically for a very heavy duty poncho, and even prior to opening the package I knew I did not have order the correct item. This poncho was very flimsy and nothing like the description. It went back."
2,Poor quality for the price,This was almost impossible to get over my head it was so tight plus it's only water resistant. You might as well buy a cheap throw away poncho because this one is no better.
2,Not remotely issue quality...,"I bought this because my issued poncho was stolen and I needed a replacement. I knew that I couldn't use it to turn in to CIF, but I wanted a poncho, so I got this one. Ok, it kind-of blocks the rain... For an hour or so. The head opening and hood are so small I can barely fit my head thru them, let alone a hat or helmet. Used as a rainfly it does ok, so long as you leave a path for run off leaking. I gave it 2 stars because when I needed it I was glad to have it, but just barely..."
5,Serves its purpose and looks cool,"The poncho is big enough to wear over you backpack and cover every inch of you for protection against the rain and harsh weather environments. It is made of durable nylon fabric and the olive drab color just looks cool.Everytime I wear this I feel like Rambo in First Blood and the hood is useful too.Overall, perfect product. Exactly what I expected. Love it."
1,Is everything it says it is except one thing..doesn't keep you dry,"I ordered this after reading the reviews thinking that this product would do what it was primarily intended to do, that being keeping you dry.This morning we were receiving a moderate rain, so I thought it would be a good test when I went to walk my dog. I fastened the hood over my head, and started out on a mile and half walk. About a third of the way, (10 minutes) I could start to feel moisture inside the poncho. By the time I got back home, my head and shoulders were soaked and the rest of my upper body quite damp.Save your money, find something else."
5,Great for rain protection or temporary shelter,"I ordered my first poncho and am ordering a second one today.The ponco is durable and gets the job done for blocking rain, I am buying a second one so that I can set up a larger temporary shelter as needed.It doesn't take up much space in the hiking bag and knowing it is there if I need it is great.Would recommend to any hiker/camper."
2,not for use in wooded area,"This poncho would be great for ballgames or other outdoor events,but not tough enough for use in the woods.Just not for my purpose.I returned it for a quick refund which was very easy to do.Amazon is great at supplying labels and taking things back without a hassle!!"
5,stay dry and warm when the weather turns against you,"These are well made and the digital camo allows the wearer to blend into your outdoor surroundings. Great for paintballing, observing nature and when the weather turns foul they keep you dry, if one owns the poncho liner they also keep you warm in the coldest of weather and wind proof. Rothco makes great products."
5,Fantastic!,Very good factual book. Covers all models and gives great insight into how thins were done and why. You couldn't ask for a better book.
3,Grateful,"It's was ok. Not completely what I ezpected. But it's nice. To God be the glory for muscians who want to share the Love of God through music. As a singer myself, I understant the hard work that it entails, I can also appreciate it."
5,Wonderful condition,Wonderful CD arrived on time and in perfect condition. Truly great music. I would buy from this artist again.
4,ENJOYABLE,COKO HAS BRANCHED OUT INTO ANOTHER REALM OF MUSIC WHICH SUITS HER WELL. MUSIC UPBEAT WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS RANGING FROM RAP TO HYMNALS. GREAT LISTENING FOR YOUR SOULS.
5,Awesome,This album is the best one I have heard in a long time. From the beginning to the end it has kept me dancing and clapping my hands for the lord. I love it.
5,Awesome - One of the Best Gospel Albums of the Year,"I fell in love with Coko from SWV. I am a huge gospel music fan, and I was eagerly anticipating this album. I have to say it has not disappointed me. I think the whole CD is awesome, I can listen to it straight through. I have been playing it non-stop for about 3 weeks now. Endow me is just great. A must have for any gospel music lover, you won't be disappointed."
3,Unexpected Joy,I read reviews that the album was good but was skeptical to buy it. I'm glad I did the album is good.
2,GRATEFUL by COKO,"I try and support Gospel music as much as possible but as usual, I am dissapointed with most secular artist who try to switch to Inspirational or Gospel. She can really sing, straight BLOW'n on most tracks but it may be a little ""blah"" to most people that have been into Gospel music for more than 10 years. Ya know, James Cleavland, Edwin & Walter, Andre Crouch, Commissioned, Clouds of Joy, Keynotes, the Winans (NOT MARIO but Marvin, Carvin, Micheal & Ron)"
4,Great Book with Good Message,"This is a fun book that teaches about personal responsibility and when we learn to be personally responsible we can reach out to help others. Highly recommend for children and even teenagers, who may need a fun way to be reminded of personal responsibility."
1,Not worth it.,Even though this is a cheap wig...it won't look good on anyone. The hair shed everywhere and it was basically disgusting. Do not buy!
2,Should've listened...,"I should have payed attention to the other review for this wig. Granted, it's not HORRIBLE but it's definitely cheap. Because of prolonged packaging, it doesn't look a thing like it does in the picture (style wise). I'm going to see if I can restyle it somehow, but it will probably be a fail since you can't really restyle a synthetic wig. Don't buy this. Spend some extra cash and get a better quality wig."
5,A Life Changing Guide,"This wonderful book was recommended to me by a good friend who told me, ""it helped me learn how to knock my old habits."" I thought it was worth a shot. I picked up a copy at the bookstore & started reading... The first thing I have to say is: thank you Wayne Dyer! Your Erroneous Zones is a guide for everyone. We all have habits developed in our growth years that are influenced by our society and parents...most of these habits are what keep us in a detrimental ""comfort zone"" that pervents us from embracing the true happy, loving self we really are. I have circulated my now worn and dog-eared copy to all of my friends and family. The wonderful life choices they are making now are thrilling to me because I know they have used this book as a guide to teach themselves self-love & self-worth. So have I. Thanks again Wayne!"
4,Ever the Opportunist,"There's really not a whole lot ""wrong"" with YEZ, and it's written so pretty much any high school dropout can grasp it, BUT... Wayne is not the guy who invented cognitive therapy. Wayne was then pretty much what he is now: a repackager.YEZ hit the bookshelves in '77 a year after Aaron Beck changed the entire direction of psychotherapy (for the better) with his seminal Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders. Beck was himself a bit of scaffolder, as he bagged many of his ideas from Albert Ellis, who wrote Rational Therapy in '58, and many other fine books.(Ellis developed Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, which was -very- hot in the '80s, and which built much of the skills base that made Cognitive Behavioral Therapy THE big deal in the '90s.)Therapists looking to make sense out what they're doing to more resistant clients may do well to turn them on to Dyer, but they might do better to hip them to Ellis's and Beck's own lay-readership work."
5,THIS BOOK SET ME FREE!,I read this book when I was 21. It changed my life. I've given copies to many friends and family over the years. Highly recommended! Thanks Dr. Dyer
5,a wise investment,"I read the book ""your erroneous zones"" over 20 years ago. It saved my life. After several losses in my life, I felt lost and alone. A friend recommended Dr. Dyer's book. I read the book numerous times before what Dr. Dyer explained registered in my brain. It was quite the journey. Recently I decided to purchase the book in cassette format so I could listen to it again. I was amazed at how wonderful it felt to hear the words in the book come to life. For me it was as if Dr. Dyer was speaking to me directly. Pretty neat. Honestly, this cassette was a wise investment for me; and I am sure it will be for you too.Get the tape and the book if you are looking for answers to why you keep going in circles."
5,Wayne Dyer's the man!,This book is great and inspirational for anyone at any age. I read it as a young teenager and it was very helpful in shaping me into the man I ac today. :)
5,Seems simple but incredibly helpful,"Dyer's approach is not complex but has led to multiple breakthroughs for me. Highly recommended for those interesting in self reflection, self improvement, and happiness."
1,Your Erroneous Zones,The condition of the book was pretty bad. It totally fell apart as I turned each page. The book was very old and not in good condition.
2,Only for people unhappy with themselves,"I heard an interview with Dyer and Tony Robbins so I decided to listen to one of Dyer's audiobooks. I was really disappointed. The entire thing was him talking so softly it was very boring. I feel this CD is good for people who are very unhappy with their lives, depressed, etc. But if you're relatively happy with yourself and just looking for a fun program to try, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT IT!"
2,The Tape Broke Half-Way Thru...Waiting for a Replacement,"I played one side, turned the tape over and nothing happened...took it out and saw that the tape had snapped inside the casing, where it was impossible to reach it to tape it together..(you older folks know what I mean...before CD's..) It had come loose at the reel.Anyway, I'm posting this as I await a new one...sent it back to KY, from whence it was sent to me.I'll re-do the review, after I get the new one to finish listening to...bummer! (Not to complain so much, as it's my lst dud, from the time Amazon opened it's ""doors"" so to speak...not a bad record)"
5,in retrospect,"I am writing this review several years after reading and re-reading this book several times. I can't imagine that every human being hasn't already read this book, but just in case, I strongly urge you to buy and read this book and then pass it on to someone you really care about. It was given to me by a friend and I read it cover to cover in record time. I could not put it down. After reading this book, I found that I was making, almost unconsciously, incredible changes in my thoughts and my life. I felt as if I had been ""enlightened"". Like I had miraciously obtained a ""key"" to a higher concsiousness. I actually felt sorry for those around me that had not read the book and also obtained an ""answer"". The writing and ideas are extremely simple, clear and most of all ""usable"", not just another book of psyco-babble. BUY THIS BOOK - TODAY!!"
2,Huck Finn goes to the center of the earth... duh!,Interesting in some spots but a bit drawn out. Some of the 'science' explanations are a bit tortured to fit into a pseudo-19th century phraseology... without being the least bit edifying. Structurally the book needs some help... with only a wisp of motivation the characters are swept along by events that don't really drive them plausibly to the actions they take. A few parts are captivatingly told but in the end this reading was a waste of time. Read some Mark Twain instead... or even some Jules Verne.
3,Required for class,"I purchased this book as it was required for a ""Beginners 2"" class at the Swedish American Museum in Chicago. It's very informative as far as grammar goes; however, some of the vocabulary is a bit extreme. I'm not sure when I'll use many of the words that I'm being exposed to. There is a CD that's available; however, I was not offered it when I purchased the book. I think that it should be ""suggested"" to get the CD as well, which helps a lot for pronunciation. Love the class and looking forward to surprising some relatives with my improved Swedish!"
4,Excellent Transaction,"The book arrived in perfect condition. Originally the expected arrival date was about three weeks, but it arrived in about one week."
3,very good movie one of James Garners best,Very good dramatization of life on the streets for girls who feel unloved and unwanted by their family.
2,"the Glitter-duD,a Cop-melodramA!","While containing some good-action sequences and cop interaction between partner's James Garner and John Lithgow(3rd Rock from the Sun) this movie is dismal-besides depressing. Margot Kidder(Superman,fame)is wasted as pretencious movie-star,Garner romantically entangles with. Based on best-seller Joesph Wambaurgh's book,I recommend a read before an eventual-viewing. For fan's of the lead-star's and material of novelist- Wambaugh's."
2,on/off button problem,"works good but the on/off button does not function properly, when you shut if off it usually comes right back on. you have to lay it down and than shut it off!"
4,What a reality!,"Wow!Great Independent film. shows importance of family, SACRIFICE, friendships and culture!!!!!! Besides the West Indian community any immigrant family adapting to the American way faces many of the issues mentioned in this movie. Teenagers trying to fit in, Parents trying to work hard to make a good living for their children,lots of peer pressure, a broken heart, deception, racial tension etc. Nice story line"
5,"ME, ME AND MORE ME!","i couldn't believe how accurate the book was. i actually discovered things i never knew about myself. i think everyone should have this book. it won't change your life completely, but, it can help you make a move in the right direction."
3,"I think Joe did some good things on this cd, please listen","I have finally added all the Joe Augustine catalog to my collection of cds. This particular one has already become one of my favorites. Joe has a nack for playing in a swinging style. To say the least, his music is very unpredicatable. You never know until you hear one of his songs for the first time what to expect. One minute Joe may be swinging you and the next he may be booging you or blusing you. It's so crazy what he may do. It really keeps you on your p's and q's.It is my feeling, that you need to buy one of Joes' cds and get the surprise that I got when I first experienced Joes' music."
2,This cd is about average,"Since I have bought this cd, I have added most of Danny Wrights' catalog to my collection. Danny does have more ability than is demostrated on this cd. He does know how to play in a romantic passionate style.For this cd Danny choose to give us a mixed bag. Contrary to public opinion, this cd is not all solo paino like most of Dannys' other cds. This cd features violin and penny whistle on some of the tracks.I felt like there were some bright spots on this cd. Danny did some great playing on a few of the tracks, but left a lot to be desired on some of the tracks. Also I felt like the repertoire was not that great.Like I mentioned in my title to this review, this cd is ok, but nothing close to being what I would call great!I expect the best from Danny and nothing less than that will do.I can not recommend this cd!"
4,O rings,"Not much to say,theyre O rings and work as it should.product came quickly and is a must have if your an avid player"
5,Tippman A5 O-Ring Kit,Exactly what I ordered and arrived on time. Great price even before the free shipping deal over the holidays!
2,Totally Ridiculous!,"First off, the series was incredible! I've watched the reruns for ages and laugh every time. I do SO love this series. That is why I'm astounded that FOX has not done a complete recall of this particular boxed set! I read the reviews and noticed that the negatives were so low compared to the positives.I took a chance and bought the BRAND NEW, still plastic wrapped box set and discovered ALL of my disks were scratched beyond belief and mostly unplayable. I give no fault to the seller, I blame FOX for this disastrous packaging. Most of the disks were loose when I opened the folders and so badly damaged that I couldn't watch them. Those that were not, still had scratches from where they rubbed against the packaging.My advice, save yourself time and trouble and avoid this deluxe boxed set."
2,NEED A DIFFERENT PACKAGING.,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS COMPLETE SET TWICE.. I HAVE SENT IT BACK TWICE. THE DVD'S WERE SCRATCHED. I GUESS IT IS FROM THE SLOTS THEY SLIDE IN. MY SON WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE HE REALLY WANTS THIS SET OF MASH. I HOPE IT GETS PERFECTED THEN I WILL BUY IT AGAIN.
2,Would be nice if all the DVDs were not scratched.,"My wife bought me this set for my birthday and so far I am on season 4.. I have yet to come across a DVD that is not scratched, and this is the first time watching them. Season 4 disk 1 episode one.. stuck, can't get past chapter 12.. This has happened on at least one disk per season, and in some seasons multiple discs. Save your money DO NOT BUY THIS SET until the publisher gets a freaking clue and fixes the poor case quality. (Read the other reviews, it is obviously the bad packaging that is causing these scratches.)I wish I could get my wife a refund on this one, but its been over a year now. Waste of time and money.I gave it 2 stars for the episodes I did get to watch."
5,M*A*S*H - martinis & Medicine Complete Collection,If you are a ture M*A*S*H fan you need to own this. What a great collection. I just love it
1,MASH-Medicine and Martinis,"I am a ""MASH-aholic"" When I saw all 11 years in this, I had to get it! This set of DVD's have quite a lot of problems. Numerous episodes are in French or no sound or freezes. I have waited years for this. I am VERY disappointed!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,I purchased this as a present for my husband for his birthday. It has taken us nearly a year to go through all the content on the DVDs with our busy lives. Unfortunately as we went through we discovered that the recordings are very poor in places and that certain episodes cannot play. This is not due to any scratches as the dvds arrived in pristine condition (even though the dvds come poorly protected). It may be less expensive to purchase this set but in the long run we are very disappointed that there are multiple episodes from each season that we are unable to watch. The extras are very nice but again one of those dvds has a flaw in the recording as well. Unfortunately I can no longer send it back or get replacement dvds - I am unsure if it would have been possible had we tried sooner after purchase.
2,WHAT ABOUT US DIE-HARDS?,"I too have all 10 seasons on DVD and season 11 pre-ordered. I even have the first two on VHS as well! Let's hear it for the fans of M*A*S*H who have been solid from the very beginning. Let's acknowledge those of us who have padded Fox's pockets, and let's get the ""EXTRA'S"" available separately! We're the one's who should have it sent to us to THANK US for our loyalty, our steadfastness and our love of one of the greatest sit-coms of all time. Let's hear it for those of us who grew up on this and are making sure the next generation will grow up on it as well by owning the series! Hey Fox, here's an idea; how about releasing the last two discs separately? Now there's a thought."
3,M*A*S*H a good series no matter how you buy it.,"I purchased all 11 season individually. Granted I don't have the special features disc or the original movie, I am glad I have the nice storage cases, with the nice art work. Furthermore, I was able to purchase the episode book in hardcover for a very reasonable price. In some respects I feel ""ripped-off"" because in the beginning I didn't have the choice between the box set and individual seasons. But that is ok, I am happy with my choice. Besides sometimes it is best to build a collection with individual pieces rather then relying on a corporation to do it for you. The box set doesn't include the M*A*S*H novel series. However, in the future I plan on renting the individual seasons before I make my final purchase. Just in case corporations decided to do something like this again. Heavens forbid something like this were to happen with the Seinfield series."
3,Mostly left-wing book (Magic and Mayhem) shows North Korea more deadly than South Korea in real Korean War,This legendary TV show has the South Koreans pretty much out to be the more deadly bunch. The show picks on South Korea's Syngman Rhee and hardly ever mentions how Kim of North Korea was so much more deadly. The book I mentioned in my title (though way too left-wingish) shows that South Korea was really much more benevolent than North Korea in the war.
1,not what i expected,"the overall quality of the box set is very poor. when i recieved the set it was laying loosly in a large box with no packing around it at all, the corners of the display box was bent from bouncing around during shipping. the set is what i wanted but the video quality is so poor that it can only be viewed on a computer that has a very good dvdrom. the pages of the dvd holder is just simply thin cardboard with slots cut in it with no liner to keep the dvd's from getting scratched. the first time a disc is removed it gets scratched before its even used. not only that but the foil backing on which the videos are actually recorded on several of the discs was peeling off without being touched as soon as the set was opened. my overall satisfaction of the set is extremely dissapointed. if the next video i purchase from amazon is this poor i will no longer be a customer"
5,Good entertainment,My husband loves MASH and watches it every time it is on TV. Now he can watch it as much as he wants without the commercials. It is a great series and it comes with the movie that started it all and a lot of extras. It is a good value.
2,Fox Opportunism.,"As far as I'm concerned MASH only lasted three seasons and wasn't worth a dime after Wayne Rogers and McClean Stevenson left, however, I am as angry as al those who've been buying up those heartwarming Alda-written/directed seasons. I want the bonus material, but there is no way I'm shelling out $200 to get it. Besides, what would I do with all those gentle father and son moments between Radar and Col Potter, or those hilarious quips between Klinger and Soon Lee? Sorry Fox, I guess my cynicism just about matches yours..."
1,Mash-Martenis and Medicine-Complet Collection,"Mash-Martenis and MedicineI was sent 2 collections of Mash and I ordered one, Discount DVD said that it was an internal problem and to sent it back and they would credit my account, I sent both of the sets back and have only been given credit for one of the sets, I let Discount DVD know about this by email and , they said they would check on it and I haven't heard from them. They owe me $121.92.Thank you Gen Whitney I don't know what to do now, please help me"
1,Very Poor Packaging,"It gives me great sadness to only rate this product with a 1 star... Mash itself gets a 5/5 however there is just no excuse for the poor packaging. Several of the discs are very scratched which makes watching episodes a chore. If you are thinking about purchasing this, I would HIGHLY recommend that you buy the seasons individually."
1,Great Show - Awful Packaging,"I bought this collection despite the negative reviews about packaging issues because I am a fan of the show. In hindsight, it was a waste of money and I should have heeded the warnings of others. Most of the discs have scratches right out of the box. While some of the shows can be viewed, many cannot due to the scratches. Whoever designed this nice looking packaging system did not even consider the end-user and the protection of the discs. I would suggest you not purchase this collection and wait for reruns on TV."
1,Packaging nightmare,MASH is one the best shows ever created. So it was disappointing when I received this set and the disks where damaged already because of the packaging. I was further disappointed as the damage to the disks prevented many of the disks from playing or playing properly. In the end I had to return the set because the damage was to extensive and this is all due to how they package the set. Buy each season individually.
3,Meh,"The MASH series is fantastic, needless to say. I am excited to finally own this DVD set.However, the CDs come in a cardboard container, that effectively scratches the DVDs the first time you take them out. The container is nice, in principle, but useless, as you have to buy another case to put these DVDs in, or suffer serious scratching."
5,Love it!,We are big M.A.S.H. fans so having all the episodes in one set is awesome! The only negative thing is the dvd's don't stay put in their holders. They slip down in their slots. I like the box though.
4,"Definitely worth it, if you can get it on sale.","I had only seen a few episodes of M*A*S*H, previously. It was a show that as a family we did not watch, mostly because we did not like the movie. However, when I caught this set on sale for $50.00, I decided I would give it a second chance. I f I did not like it, I could at least get this much back from the DVD set. So far the series has been great. The packaging could have been better. However, considering that each season costs almost $20.00 each and there are 11 here, it is definitely worth the discount to get this edition.I still do not care for the movie but the series has been outstanding. The only problem I have had with this set is some of the DVDs are slightly scratched (But play well). Also I had to return the first box set because not all the DVDs would play. So like I previously stated this set is worth it if you can catch it on sale."
4,fine,hubby likes this show more than i. interesting to watch episodes back to back and see inconsistencies in story line. mash one of his faves.
2,All scratched up!,"My husband and I were so excited to see this collection at such a great price. Now we know why. Though it seemed to be brand new. However, while watching the 4th episode on disc one it started acting up. Upon inspection for it, and other disc in the collection scratched. Not happy at all!"
5,Great DVD Series!,"After reading the many reviews on this item, I decided to purchase a used set from a reliable Amazon seller. I did this because of the many issues pertaining to the packaging and scratched discs. I hoped that a seller would only sell a working set, especially if they are reliable. I was correct and I am very happy with my purchase. Each DVD plays properly even though there are some marks on the back of some of the discs from the cardboard packaging. I agree that they definitely could have packaged this set better. A softer material would be nice and would protect the discs much better. After it is opened on Christmas, I will probably have my husband transfer the discs to a padded sleeve. Still, a great set! He's going to love it!"
1,Over half of the disks are scratched . . .,"Mash is fine, but this package is abysmal!Who was the idiot jerk who chose to pack these DVDs as they are here? I hope for he to be unemployed now . . . I know that this is not much charitable, but the level of frustration this person has inflinged to us, MASH fans, . . .As uncountable others said before, my set is unusable; over half of the disks are scrathched."
1,Scratched Discs in Sealed Package,"Buyer beware. The packaging for this product is defective. I opened the package to find nearly 2/3 of the discs with visible scratches in the shape of the packaging, rendering the discs difficult to play without freezes, skips or stuttering. I'll be returning the product."
4,all the laughter you want in one place,"This collection has it all, just as the description says. It comes with all 11 seasons, the movie, and extras. there is a little booklet behind the front cover. The collector box is failry small compared to others. However, the DVDs are placed into cardboard slots, which will scratch them. I am actually returning my set for a new one, mine had scratched DVDs in it. It would have been better to just snap them into place like others I have see with three DVDs on each sleeve. This is where the 4 stars come from, if not for that I would hae given it 5 stars. The episodes aren't digitally remastered but the story and comedy carries the show not the picture quality."
1,disappointed,"I thought this a boxed set, as I had seen in a mall store. was disappointed when it came as all the seasons in their cases taped together"
4,Great for any fan!,"My husband is a big fan of the show. He grew up watching, so it was a perfect gift.I had no troubles with purshasing or delivery, everything worked great. But I did leave plenty of time between when I ordered and when I needed it by."
3,"Did Seasons 1-4 get the ""Play All"" upgrade??","Hey, there are lots of people talking about the set and whether or not it should have been released at this time, but I hear nothing about whether or not Seasons 1-4 got the needed upgrade with a ""Play All"" selection. If Fox put out a box set with the LAME formatting of selecting each episode separately, the box set is not worth the money and I will just buy the separate seasons I really want (cheaper that way). Can someone out there advise on whether or not these 4 seasons have been upgraded?"
5,MASH Revisited,"This boxed set was purchased as a birthday gift for my son from my mother. My eighteen year old son was introduced to MASH by me and my dad. He loves the show, and is looking forward to watching the movie. He is watching the set in the order of the box, so the original movie is last. He now wants the book which started the series."
3,Marginal,"I purchased this box set as a gift. However, I can not present it as such. All the the disks were intact, but the poor quality of the case inside and out make it unpresentable. The concept was good but the binder is weak and breaks as soon as you open it. Also, the inside sleves that hold the disks are so weak that as soon as you slide a disk out they break as well. If all you want are the disks then they are of good quality. Also, they were shipped very quickly."
2,Great memories!,I am really enjoying the series and am into season two. Problem is that two episodes on one of the season one discs are not viewable. If I encounter more I will declare the set a 'bust' and will seek to have mt purchase price refunded.
1,"Great series, this box set sucks.","I came on here to buy this a few days ago, saw it had a 4/5 overall rating and thought I was good to go. Wish I would have read some of the NEGATIVE reviews because almost everyone of the DVD's are scratched and the very first disc I tried to play skipped. AVOID THIS! I don't know why Amazon is even selling this thing like this. I know one thing, I'm returning it for a refund, I'm not going to let them talk me into getting a new box se that will no doubt be the same exact way."
5,Great Series/Mash,This series is my favorite of all time. The quality of both audio and video is excellent. Some reviewers did not like the cardboard sleeves that the discs are stored in. I did not have a problem with the sleeves but I am not very large and have fairly small hands. I did take the advice of several shoppers and am encasing each disc in a plastic jewel case just for safe keeping.
5,The Ultimate MASH Collection,"If you are a diehard fan of the MASH television series, this collection is for you. Featuring all 11 seasons of this Emmy winning television series, it also includes the full length movie, MASH, that the series was based upon. Also included are special features profiling the television stars and interviews with them. It is packaged in a box that contains a nice photo book on a small clipboard and the packaging is reminiscent of an olive drab Army foot locker. Hours and hours of all the laughs, tears and sheninagans of the 4077th MASH unit ... what could be better?"
1,Damaged discs,"I ordered this product new. From the first 3 seasons, many of the DVDs were scratched and would skip. One disc wouldn't even play. I sent it back and hopefully the next one will be in better condition."
1,waste of time and money,"I Work at a cd/dvd retailer and I must say that of all my purchases, i have never been more dissatisfied with one than when i bought the martinis and medicine collection. I Did get my money back however. The packaging is such that it destroys all of the discs. The discs are scrathed by the edges of the discs underneith them when they are pulled from the cardboard sleeve. If you are only looking into buying a wickedly awesome looking box set to put on your shelf the by all means waste your money. or you could be smart and buy the seasons individually and if you want the special features...by the ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"" DVD as it contains the 2 special features discs. Such a shame that such a great show wasnt given the proper dvd treatment it deserves."
5,MASH is a smash,What can be better than the entire TV series and movie of an all time favorite show. MASH speaks for itself and being able to get a complete set makes it a hit.
4,Great Show....Terrible Packaging....Need Some Advice!,"I have read almost all of the reviews for the MASH collection and it seems that many people have had trouble with the packaging. I recieved my set and most of the DVDs have at least some scratches on them. What I want to know is whether or not others have successfully exchanged their scratched sets for an unscratched one. Since it is a packaging issue I don't know if it would be worth it. So far, I have only watched a few episodes and one episode was skipping badly. I purchased a new player (needed a new one anyway) and now it seems to work ok. I just don't want the exchange period to run out as I watch the rest of the episodes with my fingers crossed. If anyone has 2 cents to put in, please do!"
5,Simply Amazing!!!,I've been a MASH fan for years now and to get my hands on something like this was a dream come true. To have every single unedited episode from all 11 seasons but to also have 2 disks of features and fan stuff along with the original movie that started it all is just awesome! And its not one of those cheap cardboard cases - this one is covered in fabric and even has a mini clipboard in that holds a booklet with all the episodes. Everthing is easily accessible and wonderfully packaged. And the quality of the restored episodes is first rate. I haven't stopped watching it since getting it a couple months ago. And its also a fantastic bargain! Do the math on purchasing each season by itself and you'll see what I mean. This is a great product for any MASH fan!!!
4,"Great series, packaging leaves something to be desired","MASH is one of the greatest TV shows to ever be on the air, even though it reuses episode ideas ad nausea towards the last 3 seasons and you can always pick out the episodes Alan Alda wrote/directed. The entire series and the film are included, as well as some fun behind the scenes stuff. The packaging looks great, unfortunately it's not the best way to store optical media and if you aren't the pinnacle of careful when taking out and putting them in, you will end up scratching the discs."
3,"Great, but lacking","Wow! All the episodes in one collection - we love that. We were disappointed that each episode must be played individually. Would be a huge improvement if the DVDs had a ""Play All"" option."
4,11 Individual DVD's or Boxed Set?,"Ok, The way I'm seeing this is I had 10 and 11 to go yet. And combined it's 58 this boxed set is over 170. So if i sell my 9 DVD's on ebay for buy now for 12 each they are in excellent condition. I'd make 9 times 12 or 118 and then apply the savings from the 10 and 11 and guess what just squeeze by on the free postage etc. Meantime someone on ebay makes a considerable savings of my original 20-30 dollars per DVD on the originals. So instead of whining people think outside of the box and move along with life. Ok so you don't have or do ebay. Try the local markets including your paper. And yeah only 4 stars for having to force us fans into this job."
1,Enormous waste of money due to packaging,"I really wasted my money on this one. Because I buy so many movies, my family put off starting to watch this for quite some time. When we finally opened it up, the first two disks we tried wouldn't work. I assume it is due to the poor packaging, which must be damaging the disks. Anyhow, when I went to Amazon to try to exchange it, they said I was past the date that I could return it. For such a high-price DVD set, this is just unfair. I buy so many DVD's from Amazon that they should understand that it will sometimes take people a while to get around to watching something. Now I own this big box of bad disks..."
3,MASH complete series review,"It was nice to remember good clean fun and practical jokes. However Season's 5, 6 and 7 quality needs to be improved. I think they charged way too much; you should be able to play the CDs way more than one or two times before experiencing problems."
4,I Love M*A*S*H*,"I love M*A*S*H*, It is my all time favorite TV show. Now I can watch when ever I want. Any episode I want. I love this product it has everything you could want M*A*S*H*. All the episodes,interveiws, it even has the movie."
1,I feel ripped off! BOYCOTT This product,"I have faithfully purchased every season as it is released usually the day it is released. Imagine my feelings when i opened the season 10 to find that when season 11 comes avaialable, This box set will be release with extras that can only be had if you buy this box set. To Hell with the loyal customers that spent the primium to buy them individually over the last ~6 years.I even sent an email to Fox with my concerns and pleading my case for a way to for those who bought all the seasons to get these ""extras"".Guess what...no reply. Now we know how fox's customer service really cares.I'll still buy season 11."
1,OUTFOXED,"Yep, another loyal M*A*S*H fan screwed over by Fox - how ironic. My husband and I bought each season as it came out - we had to - it was either that or record the Hallmark channel and deal with VHS tapes constantly, seeing as we watch a couple episodes of MASH every night. I'm extremely annoyed at Fox. Hopefully they'll release the special features disk eventually to fans who faithfull bought all the individual seasons, but I'm not counting on it. Well, fine - if Fox believes that good things only come to those who WAIT, then I plan to WAIT this box set out until someone decides to sell their special features disc on ebay one day."
3,"If the US Fans feel ripped off, think about the UK fans paying almost twice the price....","If the US Fans feel ripped off, think about the UK fans paying almost twice the price....As I write this Box Set costs approx. $154 in the USA and approx. 154 in the UK!!! The exchange rate is 1 GBP = 1.88 USD.There is one MASH Episode I really enjoyed. That was the one when Hawkeye made up a fictitious member of the Army and it all got out of control... They had to fictitiously create his death. I only saw it the once, but it was crazy!!! Then that goes for the whole Series"
5,Good deal - a must for lovers of the series.,"My wife absolutely loves this series, and already had most of the years on DVD, but when this set came out we had to get it.It takes up less space on the shelf than the individual years, and it includes everything.Some people have mentioned problems playing some of the discs, we had problems with a 5 year old player, but found a newer player handled them fine.The shows themselves are timeless, and are fun no matter if you're watching them for the first time or the twentieth time. I just wish they'd brought this out sooner."
5,Wonderful trek through the past,Quality is exceptional and the movies are better than I remember them when I watched them growing up. As a newly retired Army vet it brings back memories of the old days
3,Poor packaging,"The packaging is a very cute idea, but not practical for DVD's since they scratch easily. When I received the set, some of the DVD's were loose. As I started watching there were just too many that had damage. I only watched a few and then decided it best to return it. I will purchase the DVD's separately in the future."
3,Packaging sucks,Okay I love the movies. But on the very first disc it started to skip. Turns out every disc was scratched right out of the packaging. The packaging is paperboard that the discs slide in and out of. I was very dissapointed in the packaging. Otherwise loved the series.
3,Decent,"HAd to return... the original had defectcts on the first 3 seasons due to the artwork on the DVDs due to sloppy painint I believe, which caused the episodes to skip horrendouusly, whihch made several of them to become unwatchabele. Seasons 4- 11 were no problem though"
1,Great series marred by terrible packaging!,"Love M*A*S*H and was excited for this collection. Unfortunately, as nice as the packaging looks, it causes terrible scratching of the DVD disks! Some disks were too scratched to be watched the first time I pulled them out! Unfortunately (for me) I did not get around to watching the collection right away and was outside of the return period before I found the issues. IF you purchase this collection, pull every disk out right away, test them, and then place the disks in protective sleeves!"
5,M*A*S*H great show!!!!,"This set is awesome, you get all eleven seasons plus the movie and lots of extras. When you see the box set you will think its great, but when you see how the DVDs are stored that's when you will be very disappointed. I wanted so much to like the storage case but the DVDs will so easily slide out and get scratched. I bought DVD cases that hold 12 DVDs and I put all 36 DVDs on three of these cases. Now there safe from scratches. It's a shame that they messed up on the design. Buy the set but transfer the DVDs. I got this set because it was really low price at best buy. If not I would've purchase the sets separate."
1,Save your money!,"Rating is for packaging only. Not the show. I'm assuming that you have to be a great fan of the show like I am to have gotten close enough to buying it to read these reviews.Others have said it, but I have to reiterate. The packaging is designed to destroy the discs. I tried to heed the warnings and got a CD case just to hold the discs. But upon removing them from the box, it was already too late. Just taking them out scratches them beyond repair. I've never felt so ripped off in my life."
5,memories!,"MASH was always on when I was growing up. We never missed an episode. Now, I'll never miss another laugh! This is the definitive collection, bar none. You'll not regret spending the cash, it will last you for years, and it's crystal clear on DVD."
5,M*A*S*H - MArtinis and Medicine - Complete Collection,In my opinion one of the best shows ever. This series stayed great all the way....... Changing just a few of the main characters really enhanced the show...... From Hawk to Hot Lips ............ Enjoy
3,Fox didn't quite do M*A*S*H justice,"M*A*S*H is absolutely amazing, and the set is a novel idea. What gets me about this set is that its publisher went through the trouble to compile the box set, but didn't even change the DVD disc art. The first few seasons are still that decidedly corny American Flag theme that was more reminiscent of the West Wing, and the latter seasons are the classy monochrome portraits-- The same way they were originally packaged in the season-by-season releases. If they'd re-done all the art and truly made a 'super-special' edition of the series, I'd actually consider re-buying the DVDs as a set."
2,GREAT SERIES - poor packaging,"My low rating has nothing to do with the quality of the series - MASH is one of my favorite sitcoms. But the packaging of this set leaves much to be desired - I received my set with loose DVD's in coarse cardboard sleeves, and nearly half of the discs were scratched - 4 of them to the point they are almost unwatchable. It's too bad, too, because this is otherwise a great way to get all the MASH episodes. You better buy the series in the separate seasons format so as to avoid this problem.I hope that whoever created this thing will let fans like myself have a discount on future purchases so MASH fans lie me can have a good, scratch-free set of DVD's to make up for this."
4,movie and packaging,"This is an awesome series, as you probably know since you're looking to buy it. 5 stars for that - guaranteed laughs and food for thought.The packaging is really cool however it broke up in pieces right after I opened it. The slots for the DVDs lets them move loose in the box and some DVDs were scratched even though the package was brand new. I managed to cut and use the nice clipboard that came with the box for use and moved all the DVDs in a different storage.ioana"
4,Great Series . . . but the packaging concept was poorly executed!,"As already stated, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired! A few of my DVD ""CARDBOARD"" slots were already coming unglued. Buying a 50 pack of slim cases is almost a requirement if you plan to view these episodes more than once - - - definitely remove them from the original package and store them in the slim cases IMEADIATELY!I had an added adventure with my purchase in that I received TWO Season 1 - Disk 2's, with no Disk 3 . . . but, Amazon was very helpful in sending an entirely new package promptly, just so I could get the Season 1 - Disk 3.I recommend the purchase, but agree with all of the other reviewers in that the creators of the packaging didn't put much thought into the design!"
2,mash martins and medicine,"I bought this brand new sealed . Whe I opended it the binder that it was in was broke, it had come unglued. I think it was poor product on the manufactors end. the dvds are too heavy for this binder to hold them all."
5,MASH complete series,"This is a must have for any MASH fans out there. I would definately recommend buying a cd or dvd case to keep them safe or at least leaving the little plastic covers on the dvds to keep them from getting scratched. Two of my dvds are mislabled - a season 9 disc has the mash movie on it and the mash movie disc has the missing season 9 episodes. No biggie, I just switched them around."
4,"Great collection, poor packaging","I had read enough reviews to know about the poor quality of packaging, but bought it anyway. Especially since this is the only option for purchasing all seasons of MASH, particularly at a reasonable price (I got it on sale for $100), and I got sick of watching my mom cradle her VHS player to painstakingly replay all the episodes she had recorded, with commercials, so long ago. Until she opened it Christmas morning to find that, not only had all of Season 11 slid out of those terrible cardboard slots, but the back cover had detached from the rest of the set, exposing one large, ineffective strip of glue. Thankfully, she's not one for aesthetics and will likely be changing these disks over to a CD holder of some sort, so it wasn't a big deal to her. I'm quite disappointed in the quality, however."
1,Horribel Packaging,"The one star rating is strictly for the packaging. The box itself looks pretty cool, covered with army green canvas but the fold out sleeves are completely inadequate. There are four fold out sleeves that hold the discs that are made of thin cardboard that does not hold the discs securely. Many of the slots were torn and most of the discs slipped out during shipping and many of them were scratched as a result. Even though it is a great deal, I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they improve the packaging."
3,M*A*S*H,Whats there not to like about MASH watched it for years when it was on TV and as far as the show goes I liked this video set. However buyer beware the way it is packaged presents a problem. Every disc had rub marks in them and every disc had a problem in the fourth episode where it freezes and gets pixels other than that I have nothing more to contribute.
1,Ripped off again!!!,"Sure buy each season like a good trooper and then get shafted. No extras on the final season, BUT you can shell out another 150 big bucks and get the extras and the whole 11 seasons again.The Avengers series did a similar thing. They put out a box set and added a bonus disc with ""lost episodes"" specials, etc. There was such an outcry, that A&E; allowed people to purchase the bonus DVD separately.MASH should do the same.Talk about alienating your customers!!!! WoW!"
3,IM GLAD I WAITED FOR THIS SET,"MANY OF YOU ARE DISSAPOINTED CAUSE YOU GOT RIPPED OFF BY BUYING EACH SEASON. I WAS NEVER A MASH FAN AT ALL. BUT MANY OF MY FRIENDS LOVE MASH AND THATS ALL THEY WANT TO WATCH. SO I GOT IT FOR THEM TO WATCH AT MY HOME. I HATE THE PACKAGING, THE CDS ARE HARD TO GET OUT. WITHOUT PUTTING YOUR FINGER PRINTS ON THE PLAY SIDE AND SCRATCH THEM BY SLIDING THEM OUT AND IN OF THE CASE. ONE EPISODE IS MISSING OUT OF THE COLLECTION. BAD FOOTAGE. I THINK IT WAS FROM THE YEAR 1976-77. THERE IS NO PLAY ALL FEATURE AS I KNOW OF. UNTIL I WATCH THE OTHER SEASONS."
1,Scratches all over discs,"I got this box set as a gift to my boyfriend. He loves M.A.S.H., so I was really excited for him to get it. However, when we received it and he opened the box, the DVD's were in terrible condition. All the DVD's come packaged in cardboard sleeves, and the edges of the cardboard left horrendous scratches all over the DVD's. They were constantly skipping and freezing in the DVD player.I do not recommend this product. The manufacturer needs to package it in sleeves that'll protect the DVD's."
3,"Great show, poor packaging","The show itself gets 5 stars from me, the packaging gets 0 stars. The collection comes in a large khaki-fabric covered hard box and the containing catalogue is also covered with the material, but the DVDs themselves are stored in cardboard sleeves that really do ruin the DVDs. I took the advice of the other reviewers here and bought a hardshell DVD case to store my new DVDs in, but in the cases of two of the DVDs I've watched so far, just the one time removal from the cardboard sleeves to the different container has scratched the DVDs and causes them to skip. So no matter how careful you are removing them, and I was warned and was very careful, this packaging WILL scratch the DVDs. I'm very disappointed in Fox for packaging up a great series with such disregard. I'm also disappointed that I have to now buy one season 3 and one season 4 so I can replace two scratched DVDs! Buyer beware!"
1,Poor Quality,"Surpisingly, most of my disks did not have scratch. A few did but not many.However, many without scratches, had problems playing. The DVDs have what I call a smeared rainbow effect causing the DVDs to freeze or skip during playback. This is a manufacture defect and *some* players can still play them but not either one mine can.What a shame.Maybe you will get lucky and get one of the good batches."
1,Complete MASH Collection,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. They apparently sent me a pre-owned version. I can understand why the previous owner sent it back. It had two copies of some discs while others were missing. Some of the discs refused to load until multiple attempts. Others triggered an ""unplayable"" message from my player that required much futzing around to make them play. This is the first DVD collection I have owned with these problems so I know it is these DVDs and not a problem with my player. A word to the wise---buy this set at a brick and mortar store where you can inspect it to make sure you are getting a new and not a pre-owned set.M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection"
3,Null review,"Dear Amazon,A month has passed and the product has not arrived. However, my credit card account has been charged."
5,Tremendous stuff,I enjoyed this book significantly. I will be the father of a teenager in the very near future and I wanted to get a sense of how to inspire/encourage my son to choose right and Jesus. Sean's writing style is clear and poignant. I would recommend this book to any parent or teenager.
2,Had a good story line but....,I liked parts of this book but it was a little weird with the brother story line. This character could have been removed and it would have been a better book. Maybe touch lightly on this character.What kind of animal are you........come on.... really? It was just plain goofy.
3,Continuity? Narrator? Proofreading? Not quite ready.,"I enjoyed the story, probably because I'm an artist. BUT - there seem to be problems with continuity, for example: * SPOILER * when the autistic brother ""never spoke to me or anyone else ever again.""... Until he does a chapter or two later. * SPOILER *And I agree with another reviewer who said that there seems to be some personal pronoun confusion in the second half of the book. Who is speaking? Sometimes character B speaks for himself, but then, in the very next paragraph, character A is speaking for character B. Also, found a bunch of typos and odd punctuation. Which makes me wonder if there were different proofreaders, no editor, or if there is something I'm not understanding.Finally, the book is too long, and I found the second half to be tedious to get through, probably because of the annoying errors. I actually found myself skipping pages."
2,I WISH CHICK LIT WAS LABELED,IT IS SO FRUSTRATING TO READ A BOOK AND NOT KNOW ITS GENRE I AM NOT A FAN OF CHICK LIT AND THIS BOOK CERTAINLY FILLED THE BILL
1,Not good,"I do not understand the reviews that this book is receiving. It is a terrible book. It started off good but when the main characters met, the book fell apart. The characters were unlikable and uninteresting. I am glad I am thru reading this book and can delete it from my Kindle."
2,Deleted,"Due to language content in the first few pages, I deleted this book from my kindle. This was my first attempted read from this author. Disappointed."
4,A Good Read,"Overall, On Bear Mountain was a good read. I did have a few problems with some of the details but I can't really elaborate because they're spoilers. I did love the characters and the story was very good and well written. A very enjoyable book."
3,Review of Bear Mountain,"I adore Deborah Smith's books normally, but this one _Bear Mountain, was slow and tedious in many ways and hard to plow through. It could have been the state of mind I was in...who knows. I usually recommend most of her books to my daughter and sister in law."
2,I don't get it,"I really wanted to like this book. I've read other books by this author and I was truely looking forward to seeing what all the hype was about. However, I was greatly disappointed. The book was good until the leading characters actually met. The meeting counldn't have been more contrived-a tornado that just destroyed her barn and nothing else-no one ever mentioning it afterward. I was even disturbed by the hero's handling of a autistic man. Just 'act like a man'. Why didn't we think of this before? Autistic, kissing cousins who are made for each other because of Mickey and Minnie Mouse shirts-who can gather black bears and drive them around town. And let's not talk about how the hero is shot, at which point I literally dropped the book and groaned.Again, the book started off good when the characters were in their own element, but when the two met, I was left scratching my head and wondering what the heck happened."
2,"Sorry, I don't get it","I am really confused by all of the rave reviews on this book. I continued reading because I wanted to try and understand what everyone got out of this, and b/c I found one of Deborah Smith's other books mildly entertaining. I enjoy a nice Romance every now and then, but what I couldn't get past on this one was that it was trying to be something that it was not. A readers guide at the end!? Thank goodness it was free."
3,A chore to read,"Had to force myself to finish this one. Set in GA it seemed that -- stereotypically -- everyone was related... very original. In the end the ""how dare you not appreciate art"" message started to grate on my nerves."
4,"Well written, good story",This was a good leisure read. The story was well written and kept me coming back every day. I look forward to reading more from this author.
5,Extra Good Gum,"Extra Cool Green Apple Sugarfree Gum is delicious. Its green-apple taste is refreshing. As a sugarfree gum it does not promote tooth decay, and it cleans the mouth. It is not a calorie-free food; however, chewing it can keep a person from nibbling high-calorie snacks.When I cook, I taste. If the taste of the food needs adjusting, I taste again. When it tastes great, the tasting changes to nibbling. One solution is to chew this delcious gum while I cook.The large packages of gum are money savers and the gum will keep for a long time."
2,Not great,I'm not sure I noticed anything different with my curls but the smell of the product is hard to take. Would not order again. Am now going to try Tresseme Flawless curls based on price and Amazon reviews.
5,A perfect gift,"It was actually a gift for my wife, who enjoyed every second. She will let our daughter read it before reading it again"
4,If you have ever owned cats!,"Terrific little book of stories about cats and if you have ever owned such feline creatures who own you - you don't own them, you will recognise the common traits of all cats in these little stories.Highly recommended, especially for the elderly who adore cats and will bring back memories of the characters their cats were."
5,Wonderful gift-quality small hardcover,"This book, a collection of some of Herriot's most popular cat stories, has a very attractive dust jacket and includes lovely watercolor illustrations. It would make an outstanding gift for anyone who loves cats or is a Herriot fan. Even though I've read the stories in his larger books and have seen them acted out in the PBS series, I'm thoroughly enjoying reading them one after another in this wonderful collection. This book would be suitable for cat lovers of all ages. Share it with a non-cat fan, and there's a good chance that even they can become believers that cats are excellent pets and companions, extremely affectionate, intelligent, adorable, and noble."
5,Ginny and Olly,"I have read his All Creatures Great and Small series and his Dog Stories collection and enjoyed all of them thoroughly. Cat Stories doesn't disappoint. Besides his delightful writing style, the book is illustrated with lovely water colors that bring the stories to life. The stories of Ginny and Olly remind me of feral kittens who grew up in my backyard. They just adopted us. We eventually befriended all but one and found homes for them. Then there's the story of Oscar. We had another cat adopt us whom we called Brick because of his brickish colored fur and that he was as strong as a brick. He was a cat about town but always seemed to come home to us after his walk about the neighborhood."
5,"Oh, WOW and WOW Again!! @_@","I'm so awestruck!This contains not only the awesome title track, but a 10 minute dance--riffic remix of it, as well as a brilliant, hip-hop~ish ""Dobie"" mix of it! It's so ambrosial and undeniable! And not only do we get THESE, my Björk~followers, but a showstopping, fun, groovy bonus track in Icelandic, called ""Karvel"". And the lyrics to this song (do a google search for all her lyrics to find the translation;), are very insightful and wickedly_cool!_!So buy this gem!Buy it now, I say! :D :>"
2,Doesn't Play,"This DVD doesn't play on either of the two DVD players in our house. I was able to get it to play on my Toshiba laptop, however, the audio is so low that you have be right next to the laptop in order to hear it. This is not acceptable for a Yoga DVD.On the plus side though, this DVD is done in a very beautiful and serene background and Mercedes does have a very clear and soft voice and explains every move nicely."
1,Be careful,"I can't comment on the DVD itself, because it won't play on either of my DVD players. I just get unplayable disc errors. Both DVD players are working fine with all other DVDs. The DVD itself says ""All Regions"", so it's not the wrong version for the States..."
3,80s House-Star turned to soul & ragga music,"Unfortunately Yazz is pretty much forgotton these days. Yazz aka Yazmin Evans was a mega-star in Europe in the 80s with house tracks like ""The only way is up"". She sung for Coldcut and the Plastic Population. But then House faded and so did Yazz. She made beautiful soul music in the 90s but noone wanted to listen -as it seemed. Give her another try. She's still good. This album has a lot of reaggae influences."
1,Poor writing & boring photos...Don't waste your money!,"When I saw that there was a book about Carmel that included the history and photographs, I thought ""What a great coffee table book!"". Unfortunately, to my dismay, I was terribly disappointed when the book arrived. The photos were as dull and unimpressive as the writing style. I found it hard to believe that a town known for it's eccentricities and interesting history could have been accounted for in such a simple, factual, and boring manner! This was, in fact, the first book that I ever returned for a refund. My advice: If you really want to read this book, go to your library instead, and save your money for a treat at Clint's ""Hog's Breath"" restaurant!"
4,Great DC Western Elseworld Tale!,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer.This is a very enjoyable Elseworld tale about some of the main DC cast acting as a posse in the old west who go up against a few of the popular DC villains. The story was very clean and neatly written with no extra fluff. Art complimented the story and theme well. Quick read, but well worth the price. Makes me want to read more DC westerns!"
1,I would like to see it translated in English,"For openers, I am well read, a writer myself and an obsessive self-didactic. However, I find this book a task to read. I'm sure it contains the lost wisdom of the world.If I were in prison with nothing else to do but read this book, I'm sure I would be a guru upon my release date, were I a felon doing serious time, which I would not be, unless of course fate were to intervene, were it so cruel - and named ""FacioSerpent"", which, of course, would be a fitting name - if you were to dissect the root components, were you so obsessed and had a surplus of time!If the paragraph above makes sense to you - you will love this book. If you also are able to condense it down to a few hundred pages, send me a copy."
5,A master work in it's field,"A book written in the 1920's, judged to be too radical for the times it was introduced is now here for a more open era. Thinking and Destiny has past the test of time, a reading that seems just as fresh as if it were printed yesterday. A master work in it's field, the book offers amazing insights into the subject of man, and his relationship to the universe around him. Clearly written, reasonable, most parts understandable, a full head and shoulders above most in the genre. Once read, the book will change the view point of many hardcore fundamentalist. The author, H.W.Pecival never recieved or seeked any fame or compansation for his work a testimony to his search for truth."
5,Conscious of Consciousness,"My title speaks for the contents of the book. I was introduced to the book in 1988 and have repeatedly gone back to enlighten my being of the real purpose to life. Percival has outlined the true existence of man. A thinker will automatically know of their destiny and life will not be the same, the book explains life happenings to the core giving you knowledge to understand and conquer those pangs of desire that makes you act out with feelings causing a disruption in your real existence only a chosen few can grasp the wisdom in this book for it is INDEED for one who seeks the SELF."
4,Great for Quick Home Practice,"I've taken classes at the Om Yoga Studio here in New York as well as at several other Yoga studios... I bought this set as part of an attempt to begin a daily yoga practice at home in addition to twice weekly classes. I find the instructional CD to be too slow-moving/easy for me, but using the flash cards and music CD, I can create a short daily practice that works for me. I wouldn't recommend using Om Yoga in a Box or ANY yoga cd/book/video as a substitute for real, live yoga instruction, however. So much of the alignment and correct breathing and meditation is better learned with feedback from an instructor. This works well as a supplement, however."
3,"Useful, but not compete.","This was useful, but I wish there were more complex poses included. A lot of the poses in the box are great, but pretty basic. However, the flashcard style is very useful for planning a yoga practice!"
2,Not What You Think,This book is really just a book of pictures that can be converted to cross stitch. There aren't any color codes so you need to make your own color selections. Not for the beginner.
4,So sweet!,"I love mini books! I was thrilled to find one with a needlework theme.It is typical for a mini book in that it a collection of short poems, quotations, and sentiments with illustrations. What is not typical is that every illustration is a full color graph (on a grid of about 18 count). There are no color keys, so if you wanted to stitch up a design you would have to work out your own thread colors. Includes basic stitching instructions.I think this would be a great little ""just because"" gift for a stitcher. I just love looking through mine!"
5,"work fine, and a good value","I use these in a hydroponic set up, a difficult environment for air stones. They work well and last quite a while in small self contained systems."
2,So-so,"Written under one of Idris Shah's many pen names. This book provides a dated and suspicously incomplete overview of some so-called secret societies. One howler is that he considers the Tibetan Buddhists a secret society! - they never were but until the earlier 1900's certainly inaccessible to most foreigners. I guess Shah thought that his audience was too stupid to figure this one out. Another is the so-called Illuminati he makes a connection with Bayazid Ansari's atheistic cult of libertines and bandits with Adam Weishaupt group. However he provides no references to back up this claim.Overall this book is a ok place to start with secret societies - but PLEASE take what the author says with a grain of salt. Shah has a history of playing it fast and loose with facts in order to support his many claims like being the Grand Shiekh of all Sufis and which is not recognized by any Sufi orders - Naqshbandi, Mevlevi, etc,"
4,Detailed account of the unknown aspect of humanity.,"The author seems to be speaking from personal experience and claims that he had personal conduct with his subject. Although I tried, I did not manage to find more information about the author but generally he is not involving any personal opinions or judgments about his references but simply presents the information he collected and leaves the reader to decide; that is why I have to admit that the book is one of the best around in the specific topic. The only thing that the book lacks is bibliography which does not allow the reader for further research on his own. The only reason I gave four stars is because the author does not account the work done by some important orders and specifically does not mention any data about the enochian system of magic."
2,A bit lacking on novel 'secret' information,"I'm afraid that these 'historical' reviews seemed a little short on unique information that I haven't seen elsewhere. I was also disappointed in the apparent random placement of diagrams that seemed to have notthing to do with the text. For example, within the first 7 chapters, there were numerous diagrams of encryption codes used by secret societies, but yet there was absolutely no discussion about secret codes anywhere in the text. Perhaps I'm missing the real 'code' hidden somewhere between the typeface of the printed page, but as a useful historical perspective on what 'secret societies' are all about, how they differ, how they perhaps associalte or embattle each other, or most importantly, how they might impact (positively or negatively) our lives today, I feel the value of this book was lost on me; or perhaps it's just a 'secret'."
2,Follow the Pseudonym,"It should be kept in mind by the reader of this book that the writer's real name is Idries Shah, who is rather better known for his Sufi books. His scholarship here is about as thorough as it is in his other works. His writings on the Isma'ilis are almost totally based on the accounts of Marco Polo and are otherwise devoid of historical accuracy."
2,Holy the Firm,"This slim little book is full of wonderful writing; as many have said, it's as near poetry as it can be. And Ms. Dillard makes some trenchant observations. The big ""however"" you may sense coming is: this book is cool, distant, self-involved, and worst, inhumane. Another reviewer pointed out the hubris of Ms. Dillard's pronouncement in the last paragraph of the book concerning the burn victim--that it will all be ok. This unhappy episode was prefigured by the fact that Ms. Dillard read by the light of a burning moth for two hours, which seemed to me awful. Could she have saved the moth? No. Could she have given it a more merciful death? Perhaps. Does it matter? Maybe not. But it left me chilled."
2,Well-intentioned arrogance,"Dillard's work is poetic, but her conclusions troubling. She tries to form a redemptive narrative of material that cannot be answered by this simplistic approach. For example, she addresses a young girl who has been badly burned, telling the girl that she has become a nun in her suffering, that she will learn something, that it won't take this young girl as long to come to the same realizations that she, Dillard herself, has reached. This seems a hubris of the most disturbing kind, to use the suffering of another to say ""now you'll know what I've known,"" when it's entirely questionable whether or not Dillard can claim this kind of suffering. Or, even if she can, that she attempts to instruct another in the realm of what lies beyond instruction. Dillard's thoughts are worth reading, but they also require a careful questioning, as her assumptions are sometimes highly problematic."
3,Leather Boots,"I've been looking for a cute pair of leather boots for months, so I was excited to find these. I was disappointed to see that the sizing starts at 7. Since I have particularly small feet I won't be able to order them."
1,Lemons != Lemonade,"I bought these calipers because I didn't want to have to spend $100+ on calipers just yet, and was pretty excited when they arrived. They feel pretty solid overall and come in a decent plastic case. The LCD is nice and big and very easy to read. I had them for roughly a week and finally got to use them to measure a small part. I noticed that the wheel that moves the caliper head was very difficult to turn. I picked them up a week later while I was on the phone just to look at them, and the wheel assembly snapped right off! Screw that! The plastic holding the wheel on broke right off... and I don't have monster hands or anything. I was just observing the calipers and bam, no calipers... I might have had a lemon, but I keep remembering, ""You get what you pay for""."
4,Very good and it came on-time,"This is a good tool and came new and in perfect working condition, even came with a extra battery ;-))It is replacing my pure mechanical one."
1,Digital Gauge Defective,"Very durable product, but digital gauge was defective. Wasn't able to zero out and numbers kept jumping in random increments."
3,OK,I had to buy this book when I was studying my Human resources certificate and we had to read this book. a little bit boring.
1,bad time,i bought one ion shine hair dryer it got to me damaged target direct is great in customer service they got me a new within the week once i got it i tried it first of all it looked cheap second it has no power as far a dryer is suppose to have third the part did not stay on the dryer so this was a bad bad time DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT NOT WORTH THE MONEY
2,poor quality,"The picture is cool, but the quality is horrible. For something that states it is an art print I found it nothing more than poster paper. The one I received had wear and tear in it, and I never got a response from the seller. Weak"
1,Ferro has written better.,Ferro has written good books on the subject of wedding photography. This isn't one of them. The main subject of the book is studio lighting. If you want to learn ONLY about bridal portrait photography this would be an OK book.The posing in the book looks horribly contorted. I would be embarrased to show these photos to my clients.I wonder how I could sell this bomb back to Amazon?Mike
3,Hicktown,"Interesting, but very slanted. Accually, Susanville is a widespot on a major route between Reno, Nevada, and Oregonian highlifers. Susanville is a town of Protestant churches, bars, and government employees. Such as the famed T & A saloon - you can guess what the T and the A sbreviates."
5,Nothing but the truth,"While reading this book, I felt like I was reading my own diary. This book is well written, but not overly done to where one can not understand it. I have yet to come across something that wasn't the whole truth. I am straight. My best friend is gay, and the majority of my friends are homosexual. They know how to treat a woman the way she should be treated - like a princess. You just can't get that from a straight man. That statement is this whole book in one sentence. It is well worth reading."
4,very helpful,it was a great book. it was funny and easy to read as well as very insightful to the relationship and friendship between straight women and gay men. it helped me understand a lot of the issues that these couples go through were not unique to me and my best friend and gave a lot of insight on how to work out some of these issues.
2,Disappointed,"I totally agree with the reader who was disapointed. Specially regarding to the judgement about those woman who feel atracted to a gay friend or also the part who says that being in love is a bad thing! What is necessarily bad in life? What is necessarily wrong in life? If you go beyond supeficiality, you can easily get that this is a very complex situation to be analyzed like that."
4,A very good novelization,"When the latest Mars Probe (number 7), returns to Earth in radio silence, Recovery 7 is sent up to collect it. But, the (third) Doctor soon realizes that something is wrong, and he and Liz Shaw and the Brigadier set off to find out just what is happening. However, it soon becomes clear that someone with a lot of power in the British government is playing a game of their own, stealing the astronauts, and beginning a wave of crime for unknown purposes. Now the Doctor must foil the machinations of his unseen foes, and find out just what is going on in outer space.This is a very good novelization the Doctor Who serial of the same name that originally aired from March 21 to May 2, 1970. Author Terrance Dicks did a good job of novelizing the show, making it quite readable and enjoyable. As a Doctor Who fan, I was quite pleased with this book and highly recommend it!"
1,Stewie? Really?,We ordered this item over 4 months ago. Prompt delivery but it doesn't even look like Stewie...
5,San Francisco by Scott Mc Kinsey,I purchased these CD's for a friend. She had been looking for them a long time.She loves them more than anyone will ever know.
5,Freddie was Ready!,"Van Gelder's production is outstanding; clean and tonal. Freddie's work is impeccable; It is all so good, with bop elements and more transitional post bop presentations. Crisis is a masterpiece."
5,=],Turtle ramp is perfect and the sucking cups are very strong for 3 baby RES...Turtles have no problem getting up there and basking...fast shipping as well.
4,Review for Towards Juristocracy by Ran Hirschl,Had to read this book for a class I'm taking.I'm a political science major and I can honestly say this is one of the more interesting books I have been required to read. The author's format makes it easy to understand also.Overall good book.
4,Fun Early Eric Clapton T Shirt,"Its hard sometimes to find early Eric Clapton T shirts, you can find Cream, which is the best, but if your just looking for eraly picture's of Clapton on T shirts, its a bit harder. This one is a good representative of Clapton from 1967, ""Disraeli Gears"" album period. Its pretty cool!"
1,Stupidity Of Stupidity!,Too many mistakes! Do not buy it no matter what! NEVER EVER BUY IT. I recomend the Nintendo Power or Prima.
1,DON'T GET IT,"This book is NOT helpful at all. It doesn't ANY and you have to figure things on your own. All in all, trying to get through the game on your own is better than with this guide. Anyway I had better luck figuring where to go on my own."
2,A Bit Disappointing...,"Since I usually play games with a strategy guide, I decided to get this with Ruby at the local Gamestop. Well, that and it was the only guide they had.Big mistake.If you're looking for a Pokedex with moves and evolution specifics, look elsewhere. If you're looking for hints on making Pokeblocks that actually help, don't go here. Pokemon locations? Only in the most generic sense. Attack descriptions (especially pertaining to contests)? Nope. Breeding info? Uh-uh.It does, however, do an excellent job of telling you which trainer has what critter, and how much $ you get as a reward. I can't, however, really recommend this guide. Go for Prima's version, or if you can find it, the Official Nintendo Player's Guide."
2,Buy Something Else,"I bought this guide before any reviews were up. I should have waited. This guide contains very little helpful information.There's no:PokedexTrainers StrategyHelpful info on catching Legendary PokemonAll this guide is is a pricey walkthrough. You can print a better one of the net for free. If you have to buy a guide, though, buy Prima. I looked through it and it's a lot better."
3,not enough depth,"though this guide does have a pretty thorough walktrough, it doesn't really have anything else. there's no guide to pokemon evolution or a guide for the moves, and it doesn't say where you can catch certain pokemon, it only has a listing for ""notable pokemon,"" which doesn't even list all the pokemon in the area. I found that this guide isn't much help with the gane, and that I could do the game just as well without it."
4,LOULD AND BLARING PUNK,"This is a punk classic, a brilliant album but don't take them to seriously, espially with songs like ' oral annie ' and ' vicars 'But if you like fast punk and fancy a bit of a giggle then this album is for.check the song that diss'es the queen, it's hilarious"
4,CARE BEARS...A BLAST FROM THE PAST !!!,FUNSHINE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IN THE 80'S. BUT NOW THE BEAR COMES WITH A DVD TO WATCH. JUST A LITTLE REMINDER THAT NO TOY CAN JUST BE A SIMPLE HUGGABLE BEAR. I LOVE IT.
3,"It's Good, but......","there is so much more that could have been included. There has never been an autobiography or even a biography of Earl Nightingale until this book. Yes, it is a love story, but it is very heavy on the emphasis of the courtship and subsequent marriage of Earl and Diana.I would have liked to have read about more of the aspects of Earl Nightingale's life, especially throughout the early years. After all, Earl Nightingale was a world class motivator beginning with his seminal and profound record, ""The Strangest Secret."" Prolific as a writer, thinker, speaker, and everyday philosopher, Earl's life was rich and varied.In this book you get a few glimpses into the man, but that's the trouble: just a few. I understand that it was written as a love story, but it would have been so much better with more about Earl.Still, there are some interesting things in this book and it is an easy read. Ms. Nightingale writes well and you will be entertained."
1,"""All Over the Place""","I thought this would be a good addition to my fairy tale collection, especially since I use a combination of text and film in my classes. This is a major dissapointment, not to mention a waste of money. We don't know if we're watching a film about werewolves or a really ""cheezy"" attempt at soft-porn (an attempt). In short, this has little to do with Red Riding Hood. The audio is poor, and the acting is even worse! Still, a good example of low, low budget cinema..."
1,Camera filters cannot disguise how bad this film really is.,"The acting in the film is remniscent of the acting in Ed Wood's movies. At first I thought it may have been because they were speaking in an unfamiliar language, but it does not get any better when they speak in English.It seems that the film maker tried to hide a very low budget with clamera filters and other camera effects. The special effects that are there are shoddy. The werewolf costumes look like cheap Halloween costumes. I know amateurs who can make much better looking costumes. There are long moments of unintetnional humor.The only enjoyable thing about this film is Phil Gibson's ass."
3,not whats pictured,"this is not what is pictured. it shows a cigarette lighter plug in when in fact it is battery opperated. the knob does not skrew on but it fits over the threads and latches on with 3 pointed allen screws that tightens onto the shaft. i've had it on for 3 days and the skrews are already loose and need to be tightened. it does come with two allen wrenches for both sizes that it needs. this should be a 2 star because it is not what is pictured but it is still a cool little shifter knob that lights up, i only wish it looked better on my car[i think it would look better on a truck ;)]."
4,Great for young boys,"I have wonderful memories from my youth, listening to the audiobook version of this wonderful book. It's Greek, Roman and other ancient legends of ""mighty men"" written for a young audience, teaching lessons about honor and sacrifice for the modern world. Plenty of ""Mighty Women"" in this book too: from Esther to Queen Sigrid. This book makes a great bedtime reading tool for parents with boys 4-12. Some of the stories are bloody to modern sensibilities, be warned, but I think this book is fine for young readers."
2,Just OK,"I purchased this video because my son LOVES the Eebee Adventures sample video made by Parents Magazine. My 10 month old has been watching the sample Eebee video while I shower since he was 8 months old. He loves Eebee (I think because he has a fun voice is and very colorful). He lights up when we sing the theme song or when he sees Eebee on the DVD. The music in the Parents video is fun and upbeat. This video, however, is only so-so. It has cute moments and a few good songs, but they are no where are catchy or up beat as the Parents Eebee video. Had this been the first Eebee video we bought, I would not have purchased any more in the series. My son will watch this video, but does not stop in his tracks or get excited when it comes on like he does with the original video we have. Where as the Parents video keeps my son's attention for a good 30 minutes, he is easliy distracted while watching this one! I wish I had purchased one of the other videos in this series instead."
1,"Boring woman, boring book","Talk about comtemplating one's own navel! The narrator of this book is completely self-absorbed. She has no interests, and the greatest interest to the reader is noting how many times ""I"" appears in each paragraph. She seems to yearn for a meaningful connection with another person, but has nothing to offer a relationship. This is definitely someone who needs to ""get a life"". Anita Brookner's prose has been praised to the heavens, but I noted several jarring errors in sentence structure. Her vocabulary is admirable. Although I usually set aside a book that doesn't engage my interest, I seem to be continuing with this one with a kind of horrified compulsion."
4,"The ""rules"" can be harsh and unevenly applied (4.5*s)","As seen through the eyes of Elizabeth, a middle-aged Londoner with an upper middle-class upbringing, this book is a most prescient examination of what life can bring in that social milieu: respectable, but dull marriage, following all manner of ""rules,"" loneliness, adultery, isolation, etc. As Elizabeth's life unfolds, it is her introspection that primarily interests the author. As usual Brookner is a master of the precise phrase, the pithy sentence, which does require a very careful reading. The appeal of this book is definitely towards those interested in reflecting on life's difficulties and vagaries."
2,Hmmm!!!,"I'm a bit shy of writing this. I respect Brookner and the high esteem in which she is held. This is one of the most depressing novels I have read recently-a vision of how not to live a life, of chances missed. A friend of mine once complained that author William Trevor was ""mean to his characters"". It seems that the same could be said of Brookner. though this is the only work of hers I've read. I have to confess it leaves me not wanting to read more."
2,"FLAT, LISTLESS, LIFELESS","I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH EVERY OTHER REVIEWER HERE THAT GAVE THIS CD FIVE STARS. THE MUSIC IS NICE, BUT IT IS TOTALLY UNINSPIRED AND VERY, VERY FORMULAIC. IT SERVES MUCH BETTER AS BACKGROUND MUSIC THAN SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND REALLY LISTEN TO. I LOVE CUBAN MUSIC (PARTICULARLY OLD BEBO VALDES RECORDINGS), BUT THIS CD JUST DOESN'T DO IT FOR ME. I GUESS EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINION BUT THIS MUSIC DOESN'T HAVE MUCH BRIO TO IT, IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. A WASTE OT MONEY. THERE IS NOTHING ON THIS CD THAT COMPELS ME TO LISTEN TO IT."
3,entertaining enough,"This story has a great potential to make people aware that the universe is a violent place. Here on earth, we think things are forever. Our sun will die one day, and all life as we know it will perish. The movie moves along pretty nicely, but the ending was a little disappointing. It has enough entertainmet value alright, but oops! we were wrong? That is great for those that always want a happy ending. Sure, the end most likely will not come for millions, if not billions of years, but the end of everything as we know it might make people appreciate the planet we dwell on."
