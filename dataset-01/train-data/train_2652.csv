5,Special,"I am mixed about the film b/f forest is so great, but the gangsters are a joke. Jim J lost it on this one. The mixing of the RZA with Bushido in the gritty streets is powerful though. Fresh and nothing like it. The main Japanese import has addition tracks that can be found on P2P sites now."
2,Not enough meat,It's difficult to tell from the description but this little more than a pamphlet. While the material it does provide is good it just doesn't go into enough detail or offer enough examples to be more than a quick overview. It would make a great introductory chapter for a real book.
5,Pretty and useful,"This plate/fork set is well made, pretty and useful. The plates are very fine porcelain and the forks and rack are shining. I love them and cannot wait to use them when having guests soon."
5,Love it!,"This was a very nice item. Like the previous review, it is well made and very nice when you have guests. I can't wait to use it either!!!"
4,Not as good as Res. E 2 & 4,"There are less songs on this cd when compared to Res. E 2 & 4. I also found that there are better songs on Res. E 2 & 4. (I dont have RE 1 & 3) The musical style / genre remains exactly the same though. This Cd is well worth the purchase. I cant get enough of ""Under Control"" by ""Masters of Ceremony. Its another one of the best Gabber tunes I've ever heard. As with RE 2 & 4 , there is a good mix of fast (180bpm), slow(140bpm), melodic, non melodic, & experimetal stuff on it. However there are no terror tracks on this Cd (Stuff like Mc Drokz, Dj Akira etc...)"
3,"Nice melodies that get under your ""shifting skin"". (3.5)","Well I read a quick couple of lines that Martin Gore (of DM) had said about this disc, so I gave it a try. First off, really nice voice on this kid - used just the right way to create some pop spookiness. Its a welcomed sound that harks back to - dare I say to 1985? I found most of the tracks really catchy with a nice, under-stated darkness to them. The first single, ""Soluble Words"" is really grand, right out of the Depeche Mode catalog. The disc lacks a bit of fluidness, but more than makes up for it on original and listenable material. Nice record, why not put it ""ON"" your player?"
2,disappointed,i loved failure so so so much and was excited when this came out. i gave it a fair trial but must say that i was disappointed with it overall. the lyrics and music are not the same quality as any of the failure stuff and it was apparent after not too long that ken andrews juust isnt as talented without greg. get fantastic planet if you dont have it. it is a perfect album.
5,Brilliant!!!!,Ken Andrews (on) is probably one of the most underrated artist out there. His songs have very progressive builds that are brilliant and very unique. This album contains the creativity found in experimental music put in an accessible form that can be easily danced to! I am an artist and this influence me to find a new direction in my own music. creative pop. Definitely worth getting!
1,I know it's my fault.,"I'm sorry but I bought this cd because someone said ON had been influenced by Gary Numan. After the failure of Failure, (ahem), I thought it would be an interesting new direction for Ken Andrews to try. But what I got was basically some pretty annoying pop music at best. ""If I get to feel you"", sounds like Ken has been studying the song writing of Brittany Spear's producers. I tried to listen to it numerous times but could not find any reason to keep it. Even the instrumentation was overdone and too busy on most tracks. He really ""should"" have listened to the strengths of Gary Numan, because sometimes less is more."
3,O.K. - so I changed my mind!,"I knew I was gonna warm up to this album - it's all Ken after all. Although it seems somewhat one-dimensional at times (Greg Edwards' ...drone is blatantly absent) I found myself being drawn into it the more I played it. Ken still has some haunting guitars and melodies that burrow into the mind, but I'm not as impressed with this as with his work with Failure - song themes are mostly love songs and the lyrics are often emotionally - not poetically - inspired. The pop song format somehow works well here, and I would still rank it above most of the drivel on commercial radio these days."
3,I Disregarded Other's Warnings,"I downloaded the free trial version of ProSho Gold version 2.0 and thought it worked great. Then I read the reviews and saw where there were reports of bugs and freezes. I tried the program again and all seemed fine. I thought maybe I wasn't running the same operating system (I am running Win XP) or the others weren't meeting the computer requirements.However, now that I have purchased the program and am using the more advanced features (zooming, and enlarging etc.) I am having all kinds of problems with freezing. I agree with the person that said if they can get the bugs out it would be a dynamite program! You should probably wait awhile as was suggested in another review.I am writing the company to send this review and the other two that had problems in the hopes of getting things running right.I am going to try another plain slide show. Hope it is only the fancy stuff causing the problems."
4,Bugs appear to be out,"Excellent program for creating photo presentations. Earlier versions may have been buggy, but it appears that the major kinks have been worked out (though a few small things here and there could be improved).Program outputs your presentation on to a CD for computer viewing, DVD or VCD for viewing on television or uploads it to the Proshow website.The program is straight forward enough for a novice to get started and I was impressed at the level of sophistication that you could drive your presentation to (if you so desire). I've been looking for sometime for this type of program and so far -- I'm impressed and can recommend it."
2,Would be fantastic if it worked,"Bugs, bugs, bugs. I'm running XP home, Celeron 1.8GHz, 256MB RAM.This is a gorgeous program that purports to do everything I want it to. If only it didn't crash every time I try to create an autorun windows CD, or a video CD, it would be great.For $70, I expect them to at least make a pretense of getting out the bugs.Buyer beware."
2,poor support and buggy,I purchased this product when it was version 1.32 but now since it has gone to verison 2.0 have had nothing but grief. This would be acceptable for sometimes getting software up to par is very tedius.. but when support is no longer available or they don't answer your emails then I would say beware of this company.. sqave your money.
1,Stay away,"I have been trying to use ProShow Gold 4.51 for a few months to create a DVD of images and narration from a vacation - no music, no transitions - nothing fancy. It has been an ordeal. The program crashes frequently. You quickly learn to save your work every 30 seconds or so. The first solution from tech support is to uninstall, download another copy and reinstall. I got of tired of hearing that from them. The program crashed less often (but still frequently) if I shut down all startup programs and services not absolutely necessary to run my computer. Because all malware protection had to be shut off, I disconnected from the Internet. The most absolute frustration is the process to burn a DVD. Half of my attempts have failed to complete; the program hangs and the DVD is in the trash. Before you consider purchase, read the support site page ""DVD burning issues."" It will give you an idea how primitive this software is. Zillions of programs can write DVDs, right?"
1,Mixed Feelings,"There's lot's of good about this product, but some fatal flaws.Creating the slideshow is easy - syncing it with sound, changing effects etc.BUTI cannot make an iso from the result.From the really very helpful support team I gather this is still a 32 bit product, and many of my problems are attributable to this cause. Who still has 32 bit machines one wonders!So I spent a fortnight creating the show, which has been totally wasted, and Proshow have given me my money back.Once they have fixed that, and one or two other things that other reviews have mentioned, fine. Until then, it unfortunately proved useless. What a shame!"
1,BS,"I have used the product for a year. I thought it great. Company policies now make me a more than dissatisfied customer.I tried to update my PS Gold 5.0.2xx to 5.0.3xx. The update site was confusing and suggested that I download to determine if I was elegible (you have to be kidding). I nonetheless did so. It updated my copy with a trial version. The company now asks for a $44 fee for the ""upgrade"" as I am out of date for updates. This is the same version (5.x)!!! I will not be upgrading to v. 6 either. I refuse to do business with any company that chooses to charge me for fixing bugs and providing insignificant improvements."
3,Great program,"I think this is a great program for making videos to share with friends and family. I have now made probably close to 50 videos using this program and I have very few negative things to say, when I compare it to other programs I have used. The negatives are that there is no internal video clip editor- so when I have a 1 minute video clip and only want to use the middle 30 seconds, I have to edit it on a different program, then insert the clip. Also, it's slow to load each video (which may be a reflection of my computer speed, as my laptop is getting a little old). All in all I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Pro Show Gold,"I think I have been ripped off. When I bought this item I believed it to be the complete program. However, it seems it is exploratory/temporary and if I decideto keep the program I have to pay more than I paid to Amazon. I don't know if the seller intended this deception or not."
5,Like Camping in Yellowstone With Mosquitos,"It's beautiful but the bugs get a little annoying; mainly unstable. It does crash and freeze. However, it is worth it because you can create some very nice slide shows. What I like is that is is very simple to input slides, time the music, and make text slides. It's easy to rearrange them and the best show I've used since Kai's Power Show. You can zoom or expand slides into the frames, change the timing, and burn CD's easily. What I don't like is that when you e-mail the shows, a lot of firewalls knock the attachement out because it is an ""exe"" file. Aside from that, it's the best software on the market, is easy to use, and allows you to make very nice products."
2,"Great features, but UNRELIABLE","This program looks great. The interface looks great, it's got a ton of options and some great features that allow an incredible amount of control. The problem is it doesn't work most of the time. My fiance and I waisted hours trying to recover a slide show that the program just randomly lost the ability to open.It crashes a lot, gets stuck in extremely long render cycles with no progress indicator (you have to wait up to 30-40 minutes for it to render a show for full screen preview), and just has a ridiculously huge amount of glitches. Other reviews here are saying the exact same thing, please trust them!A lot of other reviewers say that it is great for smaller slideshows...I'd agree, but if you got a big project, PLEASE don't make the same mistake we did and waste your time too...look for something better than this."
2,Proshow Gold - A Roll of the Dice - Better to look elsewhere,"I have made some easy and fast slide shows, and I have had some heartbreaking crashes, hours of wasted time, and frustrating glitches using Proshow gold, especially the newer versions. I think this program is best if you plan to use 1) small image files (say a 4-6 MP camera). 2) jpeg files and not raw files 3) small numbers of slides 4) all images and sound files on the host computer. I have had serious, painful and timewasting problems with proshow I believe are due to using large image files, RAW image files, files stored on other computers on my network. Right now I would avoid this software for a few months (it is 11-2005 now)."
2,An Average Read,"This book is mildly entertaining. The characters seem somewhat one-dimensional to me. I had a hard time believing Rosamond's character, and I thought the ending was terribly unsatisfying. This book is a light read, but if you are looking for a light read, with quirky characters, I like Fannie Flagg's offerings, especially Daisy Faye & the Miracle Man, much better. Overall, this book was about a B-, as graded by our book club. I give it 2.5 stars here. I would not have read it, had it not been our book club choice, and I would not reccommend it to anyone either."
5,"Funny, tender and bittersweet","Hayden MacBride is a middle aged Scotsman living in Brooklyn with his divorced daughter and her son. When he's diagnosed with terminal cancer, he decides to take control of things by plotting his final days. He's determined to wring as much joy out of the short time he has left as possible. Hayden meets Rosamond, a nun, whose terminal diagnosis has caused her to doubt her faith, and an unlikely romance ensues. Hayden has a funny and offbeat personality so even though this is a book about dying, there are many life lessons sprinkled throughout and a generous dollop of humor as well. This book is full of funny, tender, and bittersweet moments, and I think you'll find you don't want it to end."
3,Inconsistent effort,"There are elements of this novel that I liked very much. The history seemed well researched. Some of the characters are interesting (although others could be cardboard cutouts.) the concept is intriguing. The major weakness, in my opinion, is that the book is not very well written. The author shows Grant looking up from a dead body on the bed and noticing that the pictures on the walls are watercolors by local artists. What's with that? Frequently, when Grant is put in an embarassing or uncomfortable situation he thinks, ""This is worse than Cold Harbor"" or some other battle. Not at all believable. I really liked the idea and wanted to like the book, but what should be a fun read turned into chore at times."
3,"Cute, but not very durable","The decals on the shirt peel off the very first time you wash it - and I even turned the garments inside out like the instructions say! It looks very old now, even thought my son has only worn it three times!"
5,Simply wonderful!!,"This book was breathe taking. Like the other books in this series, this book was outstanding. Including many heart felt, and tear jerking stories that touched my heart and soul. Keep up the good work and I can not wait for Chicken Soup the Soul in Recovery to come out. Health and Happiness, Omisslewis"
2,Poor performer,"These nails just hate to sink all the way. They would rather kick the gun violently, bend a bit, and stay proud an inch or so. Played with air pressure and gun settings and it just didn't matter. They hate wood, especially framing lumber that has seasoned a few weeks."
5,Try this out.. excellent new origional music,This is some of the most vibrant new music I have heard in a long time. Her new origional style and dignity offer a lot to popular music.. I can't wait for her next album to appear.
4,The Return Of Intelligent Music,"Penelope's problem is very refreshing. The music is thought provoking and ethereal. My favorite songs are ""Crafty Web"", ""Lights In LA"", and ""Be My Song"". It's nice to hear songs with lyrics that speak both to the heart and the mind."
2,Pretty Useless,"I found the book to be useless. Now granted, I expected more out of it and for it to be useful for someone who has /management/ experience, just not sales experience, but it was confusing, not very well written and generally targetted to someone whose never done anything beyond an entry level position."
3,Pretty lightweight,"This book is very academic and theoretical. As the title says it's ""fundamentals"". But really it's more sales fundamentals. By the time you get to sales management you've learned most of this through exposure. It's good information, just not that practical or helpful to execution."
5,A bible for people with AS,"I am a college student with the Non-Verbal Learning Disorder, which is very similar to Asperger's Syndrome. When I saw this book in my college library, I grabbed it as soon as I could and started reading. In all the chapters, the authors clearly and consicely(perfect for people like us!) explain all sorts of relevant topics. These include dating, mental health, social skills, and plenty more. If you or somebody you know has AS or NLD, I highly recomend showing them this book. The useful infromation will prove handy."
3,Gives Me Hope for While She's Gone,"Good book, aeasy to read. Only downside is that the drinking age for everywhere we interviewed is 21, and only some allowed drinking for 21 year oldsin the dorm, so the book's time spent on how to handle booze was, in my opinion, handled a little cavalier. Perhaps it could've gone more into the benefits of exercise. There are great suggestions made, but no easy way to jump to them after reading for future reference. We had to use sticky notes in the book to draw attention to spots."
1,Too Little Info,"I never trust a book that spends the entire first chapter telling you what you will learn from the book. And it only got worse, it seems like the authors spent most of their ""ink"" telling us what we were going to learn. There was some useful info, but it could have been offered in a 3 pages pamphlet."
1,DONT DO IT!,"Carple tunnel-Yes--Fresh ground pepper-hardly. Not very ergonomic,when you squeeze it(if you have smaller hands it will be a problem)it feels like the handle will break off, and you bearly get any pepper if at all."
1,Handle and grip did not live up to sales pitch,"The handle is really made up of a cheap molded plastic that feels light to the touch. The grip is ok, but it does not allow me (average female) to grind pepercorns quickly with one hand, which is what I thought I would be able to do based on the sales pitch.I was primarily buying this because I purchased on a recent international trip some salt crystals that are twice the size of standard pepercorns. And the crystals proved to large for the grinder - - so the grinder definitely can not grind everything you might want it to!"
1,Very poor mill,"This product seemed great when I first bough it but it had 2 things wrong with it. Firstly, it did not allow form adjustment of the grind, and secondly, it broke down and quit after just a a few weeks. It's very poorly built and not at all worth the money spent for it!"
3,refill?,"I purchased this exact same product from Crate and Barrel in a green plastic and it has been great to have around. Problem: I finished all of the pepper that came with it and now have absolutely no idea how to refill it. No instructions, no removable parts, etc."
1,not worth it,cheaply made. It worked well the first few times and then became SO inconsistent that whenever I used it I would have to stop and work with it to make it work.Don't waste your time or money on it!!
3,"Good looks, poor engineering",Trudeau prides itself on design. They live up to that. The engineering does not.The mill works OK with salt; poorly with pepper. I had to keep pulling the handle into the full open position for it to work after the first squeeze.Not worth the money.
1,Great Concept - Terrible Execution,"Having a pepper grinder you can use with one hand is a great idea. Unfortunately the Trudeau One-Hand Mill is not one to do the job for you. I'm not by any means a weak man, but I can tell you it requires a huge amount of strength to press the handle. Not bad if you only want one or two grinds, but if you're looking to season meats, salad, or a large meal -- forget it. You're hand will be worn out in no time. It also doesn't generate much ground pepper for the amount of strength you have to put into it.I stopped using this within weeks of buying it. Perhaps my biggest ""Amazon Purchase Regret"" ever. Don't buy this. Find a different one."
4,Royce got game!,"I am a big fan of underground hiphop. I usually dont listen to much experimental rock, but when I heard this album I changed my mind. This album blends together the perfect balance of raw underground hiphop with experimental rock and pop. Subtleties of the Game opens up with a covetous jam by qwel called ""The Elephant"", It has a moody vibe with a dirty live drum break. The album then transforms into a dark instrumental jam called mistress black. Then comes the real Royce with a tantelizing epic called ""Prosthetica$$"" This work of art has exotic transitions from fast house to arena rock to hiphop break beats with insane Italian singing, not to be missed. The other hot pop songs are secret secrets, dont go, I know that youre nervous and shootin the curl. And again at the end Royce ties the album back to their Chicago hip hop routes with another appearence by qwel in elevation evaluation where he spells it out. . . make sure to check this one out, its super fresh"
1,It does not even have the correct names...,"Guess they changed it up , so they could copy it. It is disappointing to me, since I know some of the real people"
5,high high high,"These are fairly comfortable and will make you TALL!When you are 5'2"", TALL is everything!"
1,cheaper than the regular edition for a reason - caveat emptor,"So, I picked this up at Pep Boys for $2.43 cheaper, and placed it on my car last night. Upon entering my car this morning, and attempting to unlock this, the key would not turn. I tried the second key, to no avail. After about 10 minutes of trying to remove this thing (and being careful not to turn the key too hard and break it), it finally unlocked and came off. I was relieved that I wasn't going to have to hire a locksmith to pick the lock.I have used The Club for a long time (regular editions and one truck club), and never had this problem. I chose this one because it was $10-20 dollars cheaper than the other editions (the only obvious difference was the lack of a rubber handle at the end, and it is lighter material), but I will be taking this one back and forking out the extra $$$ for a hopefully more reliable edition of The Club.I'd advise others to do the same."
3,Great Item but......,"This is a good crime deterrent. However, it ruins your steering wheel. I put a cover on my steering wheel & it tore it up. It does what it says it will do. No one can get it off the steering wheel. It works great. If it didn't ruin my cover I would have given it 5 stars."
1,The lock will fail,"I bought my Club Basic steering wheel lock 10 months ago and it just broke last night. For some reason, the key wouldn't turn all the way when I inserted it. I tried everything I could think of, but the lock just wouldn't open. The locksmith would charge me $60 (after my AAA discount) to cut off the club, so I ended up just sawing through my steering wheel to get the damned thing off. :(DO NOT buy this item. To be on the safe side, avoid this company's products altogether and invest in a car alarm instead - that's what I'll do."
3,Basic Protection,"Good delivery time. Locks well. Slight difficulty with sliding mechanism. Discovered that the notched/grooved rod is bent slightly which binds in the closed position. This is causing my difficulty in locking on the steering wheel. I can install it, but my wife does not have the strength to slide it."
4,fun fall book,This is great for preschooler learning to sequence events. They also have fun recalling what animals are in the story and what each one wanted to trade. This book can also be used to teach cooperation and trading to get what you want.
5,Great book for teaching listening skills,I love this book and the children do too! Very good book for teaching children to listen carefully in a fun and interesting way. I highly recommend this book for entertainment and education purposes.
4,Unseen,"It was pretty good, kinda wanted to see the ending a little different. But interesting none-the-less. Ill probably reread it again soon."
2,Not a true ending,Though i enjoyed the book this to me was more of a new beginning than an ending. Way to many questions were left unanswered. Plus you dont just leave the main character hanging at the end like this did. This to me was a half hazzard attempt to close out the story. Where it brings up more questions and possibilities for a fifth book than leaving me fulfilled and knowing the true outcome.
2,What??,"Wait, so there is an evil WORSE than THE evil we now know????...this book rushes to throw everything together in a hurry, and that is where it loses all sense. Two optional endings would be great AND make sense. They are shattered so fast we don't have time to think. Leaving her only friend? Accepting death? Leaving the whole issue of Byron floating in space with no reasons why or why not...??Don't waste your time reading the first book -it's good, but the series doesn't hold up. I wish I'd never wasted my time."
4,One Word: PWN'd!! (You'll Understand Once You've Read It),"I've read lots of old school Richie and so I decided to check out this series. Though drawing all the events out into four books was sort of unnecessary (especially because there weren't many problems resolved or complete stories in each volume), at least they were quick reads. That said, I think the fourth book was great on the strength of the climax that you don't get with the previous books in the series; I think you can get away with just reading the first, third, and fourth books if you wanted to.I would read this series just for the finale. It's pretty exciting, and surprising as well. Even though this is supposed to be the last book, I think I wouldn't mind another one or two if only to see what happens next ;). Some questions still need to be answered and others in more detail I think."
5,A great read,I loved this book. If you got the chance to hear him tell stories in many of the public schools in Michigan he spoke at you were lucky!
3,There is better!!,"This book covers the gist of the subject matter, yet had some liberal tendencies, so I would recommend one that covers so much more. The book I recommend educated and moved meYOUR GUIDE FOR DEFENDING THE BIBLE Self-Education of the Bible Made EasyYOUR GUIDE FOR DEFENDING THE BIBLE HAS IT ALL:* A Preface and Introduction* A section on Biblical Hermeneutics, with 11 chapters* A section on Inductive Bible Study, with 7 chapters* A section on a Book Study Program, with 4 chapters* A Section on Bible Difficulties, with 6 chapters* A section on Basics of Textual Criticism, with 4 chapters* A section on Basics of Bible Translation, with 4 chapters* A Section on Understanding Our Imperfections, with 6 chapters"
5,Gemutations: Mercenaries and angels a great debut book from a promising new Author,"Gemutations is a great original Sci Fi Story about genetically altered humans called gemues. Thus the title Gemutations. It relates a story about one such very unique gemue called Tigershark, unique because he is the only one of his kind, and Angelina, a supposed corporate spy he is hired to eliminate.The author uses some rough edges to successfully give it a very realistic feel as she smoothly reels you into Tigershark's world. As the story progresses, Tigershark gets caught up in a reality that most would lose their mind over.I was so caught up in Tigershark and Angelina's story that I was disappointed when it came to an end. It kept me up late at night reading, even though my eyes were popping out of my head, because I just had to know what happened next.Denise Randall is a promising new author with a lot of talent and I hope to see more of her books in the future"
5,Excellent Read!! *_*,"""Gemutations:Merceneries and Angels"" is an exciting novel set in the near future. The characters are complex, as are the problems they are faced with. I especially liked the plot twists of this story. The novel has depth that explores issues of discrimination, greed, love and other human characteristics. I don't want to give away the story, so I will not go into detail, but this book is definitely worth reading.Alnitak Z. Orion, author of ""Lords of the Gateway, Book I: Quest for the Seven Worlds"""
4,Excellent book from a promising new author,"Gemutations: Mercenaries and Angels is set in the future. The polar ice caps have melted, and many people, in their panic, submit to a procedure that turns them into gemues (genetically mutated humans). They have the ability to live underwater. Gemues are treated with prejudice.Tigershark is a gemue; in fact, he the only one of his kind (his type is based on the tigershark, hence the name). He's a hitman for a powerful conglomerate run by a man named Marlin Cortez. Cortez has put out a hit on a woman who he claims is a corporate spy.I won't spoil anymore of the story for you, but it is a great read! The action is fast-paced and well-written, and there are lots of twists and turns to keep the reader's interest. The book ends on a very interesting note; the author is very realistic. Her protagonist isn't the nicest guy, and he doesn't get a miraculously happy ending.This book is worth the read, and I hope to see another book from this promising new author."
2,review from a clamp lover,"As i've said I love clamp, so why not try a manga from a former clamp member. Let's see:STORYAs far as the story goes. I can barely understand it because of the ff.The characters simply jump at you, without any introduction whatsoever. It's like being hurled in a battle without knowing the rules first. I really had to constantly flip back and fourth in between the pages because I keep forgetting who's who.The pace of the story is simply too fast!! While I was reading it, I keep looking at edges of the book to see if there we're stuck pages because it seems as if the transition of the events were not smooth.The art, although I would say that she really did a great job but because most of the illustrations, to me seemed a bit cramped it took me a while to realize what was happening.Overall i would say that I am really disappointed in the book. The concept of the storyline was great but unfortunately, she was not able to express these effectively."
3,Evil in Paradise,"A beautiful young woman is brutally raped and murdered on Christmas Eve, and no one is arrested for the crime for 9 years. I think the Author did a good job of telling the story however, I would have liked to know more about the killers....the two brothers -- what led them on the path to murder? And if the DNA didn't match any of the three men, who's DNA is it? If the men convicted of the murder are hiding someone who is it and why?"
4,INTERESTING AND VERY SAD,This true crime book was well written but the story is so frustrating. Even at the end I had to wonder if the real murderers were in prison. So heartbreaking for the family.
4,Sad but true,Perhaps one of the saddest chapters ever befalling paradise. Well written and easy to read. If you enjoy true crime you will enjoy this book.
2,sad story,"pros: great to have more info on this sad story. insight into other side of paradise living. cons: imagine loos' co-writer helped much. otherwise loos has built a solid reputation as one of the most one-sided ""investigative"" reporters you'll ever read. But then again, newspaper standards in Hawaii are not quite New York Times... let's just say, easy reading for the literary challenged."
4,another Rhymesayers success,"i heard P.O.S. Is Ruining My Life somewhere, can't remember where, and i liked it. So i went out and bought this album. nothing more nor less than what i expected. heavy guitar riffs and drums make for the music and p.o.s. lays down fast angry raps on top of it. he kind of reminds me of sage francis in that you either think he's sick or you just don't like him at all. also like sage's A Healthy Distrust, i was in love with it for a couple weeks and now can't listen to it all. overall good album.tracks worth checking out:De La SoulsStand Up (Let's Get Murdered)P.O.S.

1,To anyone considering buying this product -,"To any one considering buying this product - beware. I have been through a recall, and three replacements which ate tapes to get the cassette player to work correctly. The radio also seems to have a hard time staying in tune well on the radio. The original product worked well, however since it was replaced after a recall I've never been satisfied."

5,EXCELLENT THOUGHT STARTER,"I purchased this for my 14yr old nephew and the ""All About Me. (The Teenage Edition) [by Philipp Keel]"" for my 12yr old niece. This (""Through My Eyes..."") is by far a much better purchase. The prompts are actually thought provoking where you can expect a decent response from your writer. Each one only gives you a page of mostly wide width lines to answer in, so they shouldn't feel overwhelmed; especially if they add pictures or magazine cut-outs for added expression or inspiration. If you have a teen or know of someone this could help, I highly recommend this journal."
4,Great book,This is a great book for teens to express their thoughts and feelings. It invokes them to think and be creative. I would recommend this book great stocking stuffer.
4,Satisifed,"Pro 4:7 says, ""Wisdom is the principal thing;therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding."" We need wisdom in praying against the attacks of the adversary! I was not aware this book existed! It defines every spiritual attack that hits against the body of Christ. I was researching other books by Apostle Eckhardt and this one popped up! God knew what I needed."
3,Good for the Novice,This book is good for the new convert or the novice to spiritual deliverance. Apostle Eckhardt is very gifted in spiritual warfare and deliverance and in my opinion this thesaurus is good reference tool in a very simplistic approach.Simple TruthSimple Truth Too: Understanding the Bible In Everyday LifeCatch A Falling Star
3,The Truth about demonic possession,"According to the bible only people who don't believe in Jesus Christ as their personal saviour. You must believe that you are a sinner and that Jesus Christ died on the cross to forgive your sins and ask him into your heart for salvation. can be actually possessed by the devil. Once the holy spirit fill you after salavtion you are protected from the devil unless you do things against god's word. Christians can be ""oppressed"" by the devil or his demons usually but there is usually something that the are doing wrong in their life that gives permission for demons to torment them. Some examples are roots of bitterness, drug and alcohol addiction. These can render the individual powerless to fight the devil because their will to use is a choice and they disobey god in doing so."
1,Same Old Song and Dance,"This book was bought as a gift for me, I wouldn't have bought it for myself. It's simply a list of issues, attitudes, addictions and illnesses. Seems like the author has classified everyday issues (we all have them) as demons. Addictions are bad choices and sickness is just that, you're sick. Although I believe that there are demons and that they may oppress at times, I think that most times we are simply our own worst enemy. I really wish that people wouldn't give the devil so much credit, he's just as defeated as he's always been."
4,Victorian Embroidery,"I found this older book in the local library, and decided to purchase it. There are alot of unique and well instructed projects in the book; including needlepoint, embroidery, bead work and cross stitch, with making up instructions. The theme follows the victorian era embroidery, with alot of interesting history. At first glance the book seemed a little disapointing, but as I got through a couple chapters, it is well worth having in my resources for needlework."
2,Lousy Layout,"This is one of the stupidest book designs I have ever seen in my life. Each two-page entry has a photo of an instrument split onto the two pages. This is a tightly-bound book which doesn't lie flat, so these otherwise excellent photos are essentially useless. Tony Bacon books are ussually first-rate; it's too bad to see this poorly-thought-out nonsense in a book with his name on it.Two thumbs down -- wait for something professionally produced."
4,Turquoise Blue Lapis Reversible Sterling Silver Pendant,"When I first received this pendant, I was shocked that it was smaller than I expected and looks different from the picture because the turquoise was solid instead of marble looking (which looks nice). This pendant does not come with a chain, so I had to search for about a week before wearing it.Actually, it turns out that the size was just right and I love the versatility of having two necklaces in one. So I guess the only con is that it did not come with a chain."
1,Misleading Ad,"The Ad for this product misleadingly pictures the pendant with a chain, but it does not come with one. The fine print mentions the lack of a chain, but the picture should match the actual product to avoid misleading buyers the way I was misled."
2,A Little Misleading?,"Maybe it is just me, but as I rushed through this purchase and assumed the necklace shown in the picture was part of the package, however it is not, it is just the pendant. I feel like if I received shoes without the laces."
2,no worth $$,"rec'd this pitchback and assembled, the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time. park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults.very disappointed."
1,disappointed 7 year old,"Received the order in a timely fashion however, the box was badly I mean badly damaged . It was a birthday gift for a family member . I always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . We had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . To make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . Probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!!! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you didn't know that ?"
1,Select another brand,"Although this is an excellent ptichback at first, after a few weeks, the netting begins to deteriorate. After a few months, the part of the net that meets the s-hooks start to break off. Totally unusable after 4 months. Unfortunately, no one sells replacement nets for this pitchback."
4,Excellent customer service,"I bought the Pro Rebounder for my son over 2 years ago. He has gone through other similar types of pitch-back equipment over the years. They all have the same problems- the netting develops holes and the clips holding the net to the frame pop off or break. After a full summer of regular use we needed to replace a part. Customer service was prompt, friendly, and it was INEXPENSIVE to replace the part. My son lost very few days of use- item came very quickly. Today I needed to replace the net, which like all the others, does get holes. Again, the customer service was very friendly, and the net is not very expensive at all. I usually put stuff together, then throw out the directions when finished. Luckily I had the directions still for this, and was able to call their number. (1-800-776-7275) I am very satisfied with the product and the company, and I would buy products from them again. Four stars because no one has made the perfect unbreakable net, to my knowledge."
4,New netting,Bought this for my 9 year old grandson last year and he uses it regularly. The netting tore in the center of the lower section and I would like to replace it. Anyone know how I can find another net for this item? Thanks.
2,a little too much wit and sarcasm,"I have found recent ""Let's Go"" books to be less-than-accurate, and large on wit / short on usefulness. Several items in my 2000 version that out-of-date by March 2000: internet cafe closed, business changed hands. Most directions give mass transit directions only, so it's not helpful for auto travel. Even in March, I found some recommended accomodations were booked; could it be worse in summer?In spite of some inaccuracies (perhaps inevitable with businesses targeting budget travelers), if you are young, and new to budget travel, the ""Let's Go"" series will enlighten you on the spirit of traveling by backpack. But mainstream guides (Frommer's) will give you more useful information in a better format. Look at alternate publications before committing yourself to this book: it's heavy, black &white, and too loaded with opinions where it's not called for."
4,your first choice,"This popular guidebook features a nice and complete section of essentials for traveling to Europe, and a well documented section for european culture that can quickly put you up to speed before you go to the old continent.The country contents are well structured including: accommodations, food, sights, museums, entertainment, shopping, nightlife, excursions and good maps. Even when the information is fairly complete, I still recommend that you get an additional guidebook, like Lonely Planet, which extends the ""per country"" information.The list of hostels and hotels is good, they are not rated by starts since all of them are small budget accommodations. However, I recommend that you get an additional source of hostel listings since everyone backpacking in Europe has this guidebook and very often the listed hostels are crowded. An alternate list always helps."
3,Guide Proves to be Too Broad,"The book overall was helpful in a general sort of way. As a first time backpacker, you will soon learn that all other backpackers will have the same book and all trying to book the same hotels and hostels. That will be a drawback. The choices they provide in lodging are limited in what is really out there and some of their recommendations need to be reevaluated. As far as food and restaurants they will usually guide you to a touristy place w/ adequate food. But these are really nit picky details, the map and overall orientation of a particular city proved to be quite helpful."
1,DONT STOP HERE!!!,"I would tell you how it works but 2 of 2 Don,t Work at all. The second one died after a week. The first one never worked out of the box."
3,"Basic information, gets you thinking",The book was well written and was current when it was published. Since then schools and examination programs have changed and the book is a little outdated but still useful and thought provoking when exploring how to earn college credit through examination. Definitely worth the purchase price.
4,Perfect for the price,"Got this for my 7 year-old to shoot pucks in the backyard. It's a little smaller than a regular hockey goal, but he can move it around easily and it seems durable. The only downside was the net comes off easily because of the short velcro ties, so I secured it with cable ties."
5,sturdy hockey nets,we bought these to replace plastic ones that fell apart. These are strong and should last longer than the 6 months the plastic ones did.
4,A little wobbly but elegant,"Very easy to set up right out of the box! A little wobbly on its feet, and the shelves don't fit snugly into their support, but overall an elegant (like the dark wood finish) and compact bookcase."
3,"Kinda Junky, but functional","This 4 shelf folding bookcase arrived quickly, and I had none of the packaging/damage issues I read in some of the prior reviews. The unit unfolded and linked up with slight difficulty; some pulling and pushing was necessary to snap the shelves into place. But the unit was together and in place in less than 5 minutes. It is the perfect size for my purpose and it does what it says it will do: Fold and hold books. That's why I give it 3 stars. However, the material is very cheap wood, and the edges do not necessarily match up perfectly, a couple of the wood pieces are warped, but without detracting from function or folding. Certainly not a fine piece of furniture....but again, it looks good from across the room, and it holds books!"
3,"Very nice, but...","I thought this bookcase was VERY nice esp for the price, I actually went ahead and bought another because I needed more bookcase space. But for the price of 2, its still a good value. And it was so easy to assemble as it comes in 1 piece!<br /><br />My ONLY reservation about this is that I was actually trying to avoid the ""cherry"" color look and went for this piece because it was advertised as Dark Walnut. But I went ahead and kept it because I really like the style."
2,Broken upon arrival... : - (,"I bought the Dolce console table, it arrived in one piece and I love it. But the Dolce book case was broke when it arrived. The convienient fold out design had pegs placed in between wood when it is shipped, and the peg split the wood. I was lucky and didn't get it all unpacked before seeing the damage. I still have to bring it back to the local Target. I wish you all better luck,Carlen"
3,"poor packaging, don't buy online","I was really looking forward to this. And waited for weeks for it to become available online, since our local Target doesn't carry it. When it finally arrived however, it was so badly damaged. Two of the shelves had severely cracked and the screwes in the back were falling off. I'm not sure if I blame the quality of the product or the poor packaging. The bookshelf was basically just wrapped in a thin cardboard box, no additional packaging material.Target gave me a refund, but really, I ordered online because I don't have a car and it's a hassle to take it back to the store.I also ordered the dolce desk in the collection, which looks lovely, but I fear for the poor packaging and told my roomate to refuse the delivery (it would be a huge headache to drag THAT back to the store).Anyways, if you can find it in good condition at the store, go for it, but I recommend that you don't buy this product online."
4,"Easy to transport, great value, rocks a little","This is a great-looking bookcase that works quite well. It folds up nicely, too, which is good for students and others who have to move around more than most people. I have a lot of books on it, and it seems to be holding up fine, but it does sort of rock side to side if you push it a little. I have it wedged between my bed and another bookshelf, which seems to have solved the problem. All in all an excellent value."
5,Another Target Find!,"I bought my bookcase at a Target store. For the price, you can't beat it. Much better quality than what I saw at comparable retailers...actually better quality than a non-folding bookcase that I saw at higher-end store. At this price, I dont expect a family heirloom...just something that is attractive and stable that I won't mind giving away when my tastes change."
4,Easy to unpack and ready to display,"I just received my bookcase and although smaller than I anticipated I really like it. Unlike other reviewers, my shipment was intact and without any damages. I opened the box, stood it up, pulled down the shelves and I had a very attractive bookcase. Overall I'm very pleased with the item."
2,Quality?,"I question the quality of this product. After receiving the bookcase, I though it looked good - it folded out nicely, etc. Then I noticed that on the inside there appeared to have been something white stuck to the wood - like a peeled off label (and did not come off with cleaner). It was not too noticable, but I am picky and it annoyed me. So, I called and another bookcase was shipped to me. This one was basically in pieces when I opened the box-screws rolling around and all. I called again and had a third one shipped. This one had one screw that was falling out (which had then made large scratches in shipment) and the shelves did not reach the sides when it was folded out - this one looked worse that the first. So I sent the second and third bookcases back, and ultimately kept the first one. The amount of time I spent dealing with the defective items is worth more than the cost of the bookcase (which is also not very sturdy). My advice - spend a bit more money and get something of quality."
2,very disappointed,"After reading many reviews and checking other bookcases, I finally decided to order this bookshelf. I should have heeded the warnings of others...the shelf arrived today, not only scratched, but one of the legs was completely broken in half!! It is obvious to me why Target is no longer carrying these in their stores!It looks like a beautiful bookcase, but I think they need to make a sturdier product that can withstand the rigors of shipping!"
5,Love it!,"I am very happy with the shelf. It sits by my bed, takes up only a little room and holds my clothes, laptop, books etc. It arrived in good shape, took no assembly and matches the bedroom furniture perfectly. Couldn't be happier. Saved me building my own!"
4,good but a little short of excellent,I was generally satisfied with the product. It did have a little ding in the side - I'm too lazy to send it back - so I just place that side toward the wall. It looks great for the price - it's a cool style and it's a nice step up from any partical board shelving you might have in your home. I'm thinking about getting another one. It's folding funtion is also a big plus for me. No assembly - stylish - stable frame - and easy to move = a good rating. A note of caution: you might just want to upgrade your shipping with this one - it seems like a lot of reviewers have been recieving them more damaged than mine.UPDATE:I did get a second one and they look good next to each other - I didn't have any problem with the regular shipping. The second one didn't have a ding - although it was slightly a different color - but subtle enough where I don't even notice it anymore -- maybe just a difference in light exposure.
5,Love it!,"I love this shelf! It's sturdy! Great for our DVD collection. It looks up-scale, not cheap. :o) I'm SO happy with it, I bought two!"
5,perfect!!,"i desperately needed an inexpensive bookshelf to hold a ton of reference books that i own, but also complement the decor of our living room. well, this was just perfect. the shelves are tall enough to accomodate all of my large books...and even if the lower shelves weren't tall enough, the top shelf is open. personally though, i like to use the top shelf for decoration. i also love the fact that it's open in the back, so the bottom shelf i left for my modem, router, adapter and the cords string easily through the back.beautiful dark wood color, and it was so easy to set up straight out of the box.i guess it is in high demand though b/c i had to wait for 3 wks before it was sent to me."
4,Decent buy for the Price,"For the price and good looks this is a great buy. When you are buying this book case, keep in mind that it is only about as high as your chest. Don't expect top quality though. Most likely you will receive a bookcase that has one of the following: small chips on the wood, with warped areas or other minor blemishes on the wood.Like IKEA, this is meant to be temporary furniture - not a family heirloom."
2,warped,this shelf had alot of potential. Made of real wood along with the fact it's the easiest thing to put together. The problem was one side was so warped nothing could fit.
4,A little smaller than I thought,"The shelf is nice-looking, sturdy and best of all, there is no assembly required. The bottom shelf is tall enough to fit text books. I have it completely filled with books and it still seems sturdy. The wood is nice - doesn't look like cheap veneer and is a rich reddish brown. I thought it would be a little taller but other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase."
5,Bought it for my business,It is sturdy and of good quality and it folds up too - ITs a good buy if you need some extra space. I doubt you will be dissapointed.
2,Very disappointed with this seller,"I hate to give this product only 2 stars because I really like this shelf, but I am very disappointed with the money I spent. It arrived on time. I immediately noticed the packing label on the box. The shelf was shipped from Target. I went to the Target website and found out that this shelf was on sale at the time. It was over half the price and the store offers a free shipping. I could have had 2 shelves for the money I spent"
1,Poor Quality And Bad Customer Service.,"This shelf is very cheap and of poor quality. It doesn't match up to the description listed on amazon.The shelf cost $70 to purchase plus $30 to ship. When I returned the product because of the poor quality, the seller will only refund the $70, but not the shipping. Not to mention it cost another $85 to ship back.I paid more in shipping total, than the list price. The seller doesn't respond to emails and refuses to pay fir the return shipping. Don't purchase this product. The Dollae General Store has better quality product. Don't purchase anything from this seller."
1,first unpleasant experience,I have purchased many products from target this is the second item that I have received damaged..it takes to much to return this item...i also purchased a lamp to put on top of bookcase and the lamp does not work...very very disappointed..
2,Parts missing...,It would have rated it higher but the bottem foot peices were missing and I didn't have time to deal with it so I just put nails the bottom to hold it together. It looks ok but probably would have looked much better with feet attached.
2,Disappointed,The product folds easily so it sets up in just a minute but it came in so badly scratched I am embarrased to display it.
4,"overall, a good buy","A good price for a solid wood department store bookcase (pine), when other cheap, laminate bookshelves are similarly priced and of markedly lower quality. The &quot;dark walnut&quot; is a nice, deep color. My only problem is that one of the sides of my unit appears to be stained a slightly lighter color than the shelves and other support pieces (cherry?) It is not too noticeable with a casual glance. This unit should be fine for an apartment or bedroom bookcase. If you are like me and have waves of paperback and hardcover books to find places for, stack more paperbacks on this bookcase than hardcover; the handiness of its collapsibility detracts slightly from its overall sturdiness. Does not fit standard coffee-table-size books on lower three shelves."
5,Great Inexpensive Bookcase,"I bought this bookcase several months ago and I love it. It looks nice, is extremely sturdy (even withstanding my toddler's attempts to climb it around all the books), the finish matches antiques in the room, and nearly everyone who visits comments on what a nice little shelf it is. Plus, there is no assembly; just take it out of the box and fold it out! I will definitely be buying several more of these."
2,Real wood -- but slapped together,"I had great hopes for this item though not especially high expectations. Nevertheless, straight out of the box, one of the hinges was pulled right out of the wood, several dowels used to assemble the pieces were clearly visible because the boards apparently are not long enough, several corners were chipped -- under the finish so it happened before assembly, two of the shelves were either terribly misaligned or warped so they did not seat correctly. Yes, it was an instant-assembly item. Yes, it is actually made out of real wood. Yes, the design is very nice. But, no, I'm not keeping it because the thing was slapped together without consideration for quality control and I'd be too wary of putting any weight on the shelves because half of them don't seat properly (or at all) on their support pegs."
4,Unrestricted,This album was Da Brat at her best. I was pleasantly surprised at how well she flowed on this ablum. Definitely one of the best female MC's period.
5,SHEEEE BACKKKKKK!,"I'm not a big brat fan but she did her thang on this joint i'm diggin all the tracks on this CD plus she has guest rappers and MILLI JACKSON..(i'm not going to tell you the rappers that won't be fair everybody and they mama will be buing this cd.)HOLLA,HOLLA...THAT'S THAT RAPPER....GET IT WET...."
4,Da Brats hottest beats,"Da brats new hot album is eating up the charts in music world today.The album is bumpin' on the westcoast all over.The people of ""Watts"" are really big fans since it features recording artist mr. coca-cola Tyrese. I feel that this will be up their in the top five list. The brat just keeps on banging where ever she goes.This is coming from recording artist ""Tha Gunz"" soon to be in the industry,loving what you're doing keep it up."
4,#1 Fan,"Yo, the album is banging with only about one flaw. She didn't burn on all the tracks like I know she can. The featurings with Mystical, Ja Rule, and Twista were off the hook and the way the album starts is enough to deserve 3.5 mics! All in all this album is pretty much up to her skill level and it's a must have for any Brat fan."
3,Not Bad,"This album isn't bad. She has some tight cuts, some of the beats are lame but she still holds it down. This is not a bad buy."
2,2.5 Stars,"Unrestricted is Da Brat at her best. She improves lyrically and shows a different side of herself. Still she does not impress me, she still could do alot better considering she has one of the best flows in female emcee history. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,Not Bad,"This album wasn't bad but some tracks lagged. Brat drops dope lyrics but she needs to touch up her beats. ""What do you like"" is the dopes track on the album."
5,Guess Who's Back In Tha Muthaf**kin' House!,"Da Brat's latest album, ""Unrestricted"" showcases her playful rhymes. With the help of vocalists Kelly Price and Tyrese, this album rounds out nicely. After the debut of the album's first video this week on MTV, Da Brat's reach should climb up there with albums of fellow Rap artists Dr. Dre, Missy Elliot and Lil' Kim's expected June release. ""Unrestricted"" could be one of the year's best!"
3,"Da Brat shows many signs of.....""maturity"".","There's plenty of Da Brat's usual funky, staccato rap style on Unrestricted, her follow-up to 1996's Anuthatantrum. But Unrestricted -- which features guest twiddlers such as Timbaland joining resident producer Jermaine Dupri -- is all about playing the field. Grown up but still attitudinal, Da Brat manages to sound as sultry as her R&B soul sisters without deigning to play the sex kitten. On an amorous duet with Tyrese, ""What 'Chu Like,"" she prowls and growls, then simmers Caribbean-warm on ""What's on Ya Mind."" She drops Rasta raps in ""Back Up'' with Ja Rule, then meows like a feline looking for her tom on ""Breeve on Em."" Da Brat still carries traces of the novice hardcore kid of 1994's Funkdafied, but now she's learned how to make love and trouble at the same time."
4,Bought for mid-upper back pain,Bought this for my boyfriend who has chronic back pain. The moist heat soothes his pain. The only complaint he has is that it doesn't stay hot for too long.
4,Good for younger kids,"I recently got a few of the kids songs dvds and my 5 year old loves it. Its a lot of singing and dancing they teach different things, and she looks forward to watching it."
3,Not the Very Best!!!,"Whilst I am an avid fan of Keiko's music and enjoy all her CDs this is just another re-issue of her early catalogue. This tracklist is from her 2 early CDs Under Northern Lights (tracks 1,3,5,7&9) and No Borders (tracks 2,4,6,8,10&11) and is far from her VERY best as much of her better work can be found on later albums such as Sapphire, Doll, Deep Blue and Whisper from the Mirror. Also try her new CD Walls of Akendora on which the Japanese version has a bonus DVD of a concert in Tokyo which is simply fantastic. Quite simply there are much better Keiko CDs out there rather than this re-issue but if you don't have her early material then this is a good sample of it."
1,Where is she in this CD?,"I have 4 other K.M. cds and they are all beautiful sounds, I like piano music.This CDis a big disappointment because it sounds like a smooth jazz group like ForePlay or the Rippingtons, with very little of K.M. piano solo music. I actually thought I had received a mis-labeled cd from my club who I ordered this from but that was not the case."
3,Too Early In Her Career,"With some artists, the earlier in their career the better;but with the wonderful Keiko Matsui, I believe, the later in hercareer the better...and this is no fault of hers. Her earlieralbums are produced with WAY TOO MANY VOCALS AND CHEESY SAXAPHONE SOLOS, while her later albums have her genius backed up by electronica, deep bass, etc. without voclas. In other words, ""they""finally figured out how to best present her. This ""Very Best of"" CD is a prime example. Consisting of selections from her 2nd and 3rd CDs, it has WAY TOO MAY VOCALS AND CHEESY SAXAPHONE SOLOS...though Keiko's work itself is always beautiful."
4,An even-handed presentation,"I first read ""The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception."" I found that book to be rather sensationalistic and somewhat one-sided in its presentation.The author of ""The Hidden Scrolls,"" on the other hand, seems to have paid a lot more attention to research and to getting both sides of the story. His presentation, while quite readable, is far less exciting, but I think it is also far more credible, overall.""The Hidden Scrolls,"" being published several years after ""The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception"" and also several years after the public release of the full scroll contents, has more material about the scrolls to draw from, which gives it a further advantage.I wouldn't completely dismiss ""The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception,"" but if you do read that one I'd read it first and then read ""The Hidden Scrolls"" to get a more reasoned view."
3,Different cover than shown?,"This was a gift for a Brian Wilson fan, and was not the same cover as shown on the Amazon ad."
5,I Hope it's Nice,"For Brian being reunited with the Beach Boys. I saw Brian with his group last June at Wolf Trap Park and he was incredible. His voice is a bit gruff yet I could hear the sincerity in his voice. I was going to go and see the Beach Boys 50 th and at this point I am glad I did not go after reading this book.Brian Wilson is and always will be the heart and soul of the Beach Boys. I have listened to some footage of their 50 th tour. Not overall impressed. As far as this book you decide if Gene Landy was ""evil"" or not parts of the may make you feel so yet, when in trouble the ""family"" of Brian's called Landy in a second time. Some evil guy huh, get two cracks at Brian.Well written book from the soul."
5,Great book,"Heard about this book awhile ago. Actually heard about how dysfunctional is family was years ago but never got the book. Glad i did...its heartbreaking what he and his brothers went through. I cried, laughed and wished the whole family had gotten counseling. This book is great...hard to put down. Get this book."
4,SOB-FEST!,The details in Brians book can bring even the hardest heart to tears. The trauma and other events poor Brian went through is also documented here. I Loved it!
3,Mixed Emotions,"It's hard to know where Brian Wilson ends and Eugene Landy begins in this book. From all I've heard and have been told, Landy ""brainwashed"" Brian at one point in his life, so who knows WHAT the truth is in this book? I can figure pretty much of it out, as far as facts about Brian's troubles and condition; however, Landy seems like a character with a lot left to be desired. I am so thankful that Brian emerged triumphant through all of his problems, but I would rather give that thanks to God than to Eugene Landy. I guess when reading this book the reader has the option to distinguish fact from fiction. It isn't always easy. My review is quite vague, because I was left puzzled by what REALLY happened during Brian's association with Landy."
2,Eh.,"I got carried away and purchased this for my daughter's first birthday. Two months later, it's already taking up room in the garage. She loves music, but this just wasn't that interesting to her. She spends a lot more time with herLeapFrog LeapStart Learning Table. I think she'd like this more if the songs were longer. Also, it seems difficult to reactivate -- you have to turn the cube to a different side to hear another song, so you can't easily re-hear the same song. Does that make sense?"
5,Sing the Hits of Collective Soul,"This is a fun and well-done karaoke CD of some of Collective Soul's biggest hits, including ""Run"", ""The World I Know"", ""Blame"", ""She Said"", ""No More, No Less"", and ""Precious Declaration."""
3,"More often that not less is more, but alas, here it is not.","I agree with the previous reviewers: the content is good, but too short. When I first played the CD I thought it was a sampler of the soundtrack - the tracks aren't allowed to run long enough to establish the mood. It's a tad dissapointing."
4,Living German,"A wonderful book. I was inspired to purchase it as I already posessed the Living French book of the same series. I reccommend to anyone, of beginner to moderate capability.The lessons are successive; each one builds on preceeding ones. It is such a delight to read the stories and excersices, by the time you finish you won't even realise that you've been studying grammar/spelling/rules."
3,Problem with training bag,The Wavemaster Training Bag was purchased for my 24 year-old son. He said the interior of the bag was not solid enough and it skids around when he punches the bag. The bottom of the stand should have some sort of gripper on it so it doesn't slide. We have tried putting it on carpet and a rubber backing to no avail.
3,This took two weeks to get - beware!,"I don't understand why this took so long to ship and deliver given it was through Amazon and not another vendor, and that I have prime. It was a gift. So not sure what condition it arrived in or how well it performs. Will write more later, but right now kinda peeved."
1,partial product,"I expected this product to come with a base. It did not, and no where on the site did it state that it was a partial product."
2,Punching Bag???,"First of all you have to fill it with so much sand otherwise it moves around while kicking or punching it..then it didnt come with a video tape or any instructions or workouts so if this is your first time its useless, so I had to purchase a workout video for this punching bag.... VERY UNHAPPY"
3,Ok....just ok,I first filled my Wavemaster with water. It leaked constantly out of the cap that covers the fill hole. Plus it moved an inch or so every time i kicked it. So I'd have to work it from one angle until it had creeped across the room and then go work it from the other angle to get it back to the starting point. Later I filled it with sand. Much better. I had some rakes leaning against it in the garage for about a year. The pound or so of pressure actually BENT it!! It actually has a 5 degree bend in it from the pressure of some RAKES leaning against it!!!
2,Too Light with water,"I filled it with water, and boy its too light. I live on an upstairs apartment and can't use it. It just bounces too much with even slightest of punches and the whole bottom apartment starts to complain.Haven't tried it with sand yet, but yeah if u buy it try not to fill it with water."
3,great for beginners,"This bag is great for beginners or for those that don't like to go as hard as they can. Although they claim 250lb or more in the base, it moves quite a bit. On concrete, where I have it in the back yard, it makes a lot of noise. But, it's a great bag, and can take whatever you throw at it. Make sure you wear gloves, in the first 15 minutes after I got it, I tore my knuckles apart punching it."
3,Moves too much,"I got the bag and was very excited,, could not wait to use it. I went out and bought 250 lbs of sand. It took me 2 days to fill the bag (it is a major undertaking). I purposely wanted to fill it with sand in order to make it more stable, but that was not the case. I am 4""11"" tall and weigh 115 lbs, but when I do my boxing workouts the bag is all over the place. I tried on the carpet, I put yoga mat under the bag, but nothing worked. I had to stick it in the corner and line the corner with the yoga mat in order not to scratch the wall. Now it is more or less stable. The bag is made well, but I can't imagine how a large man or even a teen in good shape would be able to use it."
3,Good for kid,This thing is too soft and too light. Even when you fill it with water you can push it back with a bunch. Don't know how long this will last yet.
3,Ok for the price,"I just got my bag and was really excited about it but then I started punching it.PROS:--It is very easily stored as it is not too large when all the way down to the bottom setting.--The bag itself seems to be pretty durable and can take some punishment.--good priceCONS:--I am 6'3 and need the bag to be at the highest adjustment for a good straight punch. When it is at that adjustment, the bag is very wobbly and makes a lot of noise when it is punched. I had to use duct tape to tape the bag to the base for less movement. This makes it tough to adjust the height to be lower for kicks.--It makes a lot of noise when it scoots across the concrete floor of my garage during a workout. I havent tried sand in the base only water and that may be my next option to remedy this problem.IN SUMMARY: If I had to do it again, I would probably opt for the larger wavemaster XXL. I will make do with what I have for now, but if you are a larger framed person, go for the larger bag, not the cheaper one."
2,"Good for punching, poor reliability for kicking","For a lightweight bag this started out ok. I could live with the fact that it tended to slide across my garage floor (incentive to keep moving I expect...) Unfortunately, after only a few months of use, when kicking the bag now falls to the lowest setting. If you are going to spend the money, buy the full-sized wavemaster, not the one with the adjustable height."
4,perfect for a smaller person,"PROS:Take it out of the box, fill it with water, ready for action.Cheap, only $99 at my local sporting goods store.A smaller person could get a lot of use from thisCONSit is kind of noisy as it rock back and forth on the patio,it creeps around the more you hit it, (for a man my size, it rocks too easily)it is difficult to move without damaging the plasticSUMMARYAs long as you're not trying to develop a knock out punch or train for the MMA, this is a pretty good investment... BUT probably best suited for users weighing less that 150 and smaller than 6' (its not very tall)I am 6'-1"", 220 and this is undersized for me, however if I use it at the end of my workout and don't try to kill it, it's fun and good for cardio."
3,Moves around a lot,"I like the bag, but it slides across the floor as I hit it. I bought a rubber mat from Home Depot to put under it and although it is much better, it is still a problem."
4,great piece of gear,Century products are solid as always. Would have given it 5 stars but I was expecting pad to run the entire length of base- when in the taller slot there is a gap. Get the Century XXL. Turns out the model ( less expensive) I got works fine for my uses
5,Blown Away!,"Just received this box set from Amazon.com last week. Still making my way through it. I'm only on Disc 2 as the first disc just blew me away! Of all the cd's I've purchased in the past ten years, this ranks among the finest. Great for novices to Miles as well as audiophiles! Sounds great on surround sound. This is Jazz for the ages. At the end of the 21st century, we'll still be looking back to 1955-1961 as one of the all time great eras for Jazz. Thank you Miles and Coltrane! Buy this and you will be blown away!"
2,Only for the completist,"There is some excellent material here but it's all in sequential order and I really don't feel Miles wanted us to hear it that way. If he did, it would've been released sequentially by Miles. My advice would be to get the albums from this era and hear the material as Miles intended. Unless of course you want four different versions of 'Two Bass Hit' which aren't really that different, anyway.Also, I have to say the packaging is not that great. It's awkward getting to the cds."
3,Pretty Good but it's Just Repackaging,I Have alot of Both Miles Davis&John Coltrane's Music.but this kind of Packaging speaks of Greed.of Course it's Great.but The label keeps Re-Releasing Product in so Many Quanitys that it Becomes Dizzy after a While.if you don't already have Most of this Material you should get this.but if You already have it Don't spend almost 100 DOllars on Outtakes&a Song here&there.it's Over-priced and it's not much New Material.
4,Remember to buy paper,"This is a really nice product, but for the price you would think it came with fillers. Don't forget to buy fillers because it comes empty."
5,Great Service-Great Projector,"Electronics-Expo is great to deal with. Fast shipping, great packing, great customer service.Best projector under $2,000 available...hands down. Get an HDMI switcher if you have more than one HDMI device."
5,I Just Love It (despite minor drawbacks),"I was not able to find a better projector with a short throw lense. I am able to get approx 125"" image from about 12' distance. Awesome picture quality with HDMI. It does have limitations.. not much room to adjust the image vertically. And I was not able to find a way to adjust the image horizontally, but I worked around it by mounting the projector at the required location. I paid much more to buy this projector in Dec'06. I strongly recommend this product."
2,BLUE MURDER,BOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!!! CAN'T SLEEP? TRY WATCHING AN EPISODE OF THIS CRAP.ON AND ON AND ON.COULD HAVE SOLVED CASE IN 30 MINUTES NOT TWO HOURS.
1,terrible quality!,"I ordered this jersey as a Christmas gift for my daughter and recieved it through ""Teams"" distributor. The first time I washed it almost all of the numbers came off!! And I followed the laundering directions explicitly! I am very disapointed to say the least!!!"
5,Wild Yam,"Wild Yam is widely used as a breast enlarger and a sexual stimulant. Been using for about a week, but hoping to see benefits soon. Another plus is that I can take them with or without food and they never make me sick to my stomach."
5,Best work on WW2 photogs,"This is the best work done on Photographers IN the WW2 military. It does not cover the civillian photographers of news agencies, but just the men who served in uniform. It does that job very well, and has yet to be bettered. I'm not sure it really ever could.This is a MUST READ for anyone interested in WW2 era military photogrpahy."
3,an interesting glance on second world war,"I ordered the book because my father Robert B. Spafford jr. was mentioned in it and discovered a few details about his life that I'd ignored (he was proud, but shy about his war experiences)."
2,Second worst Zatoichi film,"The studios were playing up to not only the 2 biggest screen characters of the time but also the 2 most favorite actors of the time. Unfortunately, Mifune Toshiro phones in his performance. Almost a prelude to the acting he would do under his own production and direction. It is your standard Zatoichi movie except that it stretches the boundaries (not in a good way) of what is typical of these. Unfortunately, they decided that two stars of this magnitude required maximumm screen time so we a relegated to nearly 30 minutes more than the average Ichi movie. Unfortunately was wasted on this drivel."
3,Beware : This CD is sourced from vinyl,"It's nice to have this ""Record"" available after so long. Any British folk album from 1965 generally has some merit, and this is no exception. The first album by Mick Softley, and most of the tracks are original. Extensive liner notes mentioning various aspects of Mick's career, including record releases, early history and influences, and more recent news. The compiler is very excited about this eventually being available on CD. But not so excited about informing the music buying public that the sound comes from someone's 39 year old record.Still, it's a relatively clean copy, and if you can't wait until someone finds the master tapes and does the job properly you won't be disappointed, now that you've been informed.Four stars when they use the master tapes."
2,chip easily,These bowls are beautiful - but just like the mugs of the same color - they chip very easily.
5,Great little tool box,I bought 2. One for me and one for my niece. Just to put a few tools in. Its a great little box. I know she is going to like it. Great quality.
4,Gift for my husband,Another Bogie movie for his collection. He will enjoy this one as much as the rest of the set that I got him for Valentines Day.
3,dissapointment,"I loved the movie GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI. And I loved the RZAs instumentals. Unfortunately this CD isn't aimed at fans of the movie who enjoyed the hypnotic instrumentals. They are no where to be found on the CD. I wish I had known this before breaking the seal, alas, it's too late.This is strictly a hip-hop compilation, with a few of Forest Whitaker's Samurai Code quotes thrown in. On those terms, it's okay. There are some pretty cool tracks. I like 4 Sho Sho, Cakes, Don't Test, and Fast Shadow quite a bit. Samurai Showdown is pretty good... a version of the opening title music adapted with rap lyrics (it's heard in the end credits), but the lyrics drown out the hypnotic mood of the music. Some of the tracks are sub-par hip-hop, however, and should have been replaced by some of the instrumental music."
3,NOT just the erie instrumental,"...It seems that those who saw the movie first are craving for the erie instrumentals and when they bought the CD didn't get it. Those who are fans of the artists on this CD love it... It is not a bad CD but it is NOT what you are looking for if you are looking for the MUSIC from the movie. The quotes are great and all, and so is the rap, but I really wanted to hear the instrumentals."
1,song in car,"When the movie starts Ghost Dog rips a car and plays a burned cd in the mega Kenwood cd player while driving to his job. The killer song you hear during this ride is called 'Killah Priest - From Then Till Now'. It's NOT on this album, nor is any other track you hear in the movie. The cd is just a commercial rip off, not worth buying nor downloading at all. The tracks on this album have absolutely nothing to do with the movie :("
1,Worst Soundtrack,"RZA is probably one of the best hip hop producers of all time. I can't believe he WASTED great instrumentals on the songs on this album. The artists are mostly Wu Tang Clan proteges, with a few of the Wu thrown in. The lyrics are mediocre at best, and boring, very boring. The hooks are pointless (ie ""fo sho sho"") and not catchy, but just annoying. The attempts at r&b are the worst. There isn't one song on here that I'd call mediocre or pick to rip onto my mp3 player. I've listened to this numerous times, both when i initially purchased this cd years ago, and after reading comments on here saying this is worth 5 stars. BELIEVE ME, this is not good music, period. I recommend buying another cd, ANY other cd. I wouldn't even recommend downloading any of these songs, none of them are even worth the 99 cents. DON'T BUY THIS CD! Not even die hard RZA/Wu Tang fans."
4,The new WU-BANGER,"When you thought WU-TANG sucks, you must be crazy! RZA is WU's leader and he produced the whole album. You can found his voice back in 4 of the 12 numbers (7 numbers are just skits). Other WU talent of the old and new school are: BLACK KNIGHTS OF THE NORTSTAR, METHOD MAN, TEKITHA, 12 O'CLOCK, BLUE RASBERRY and more... On this album it comes clear that the WU is worldwide! You thought they were EASTCOAST? On this album are the WESTCOAST KILLABEES. Togheter with GHOSTFACE's new album SUPREME CLIENTELE the WU-TANG strikes again!"
3,WU-TANG SEMI COME BACK,THE MOVIE IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE SOUNDTRACK.HOWEVER FAST SHADOW AND SAMURI SHOWDOWN ARE REALY GOOD SONGS(THEY ARE ALSO THE ONLY TWO SONGS DONE BY ORIGINAL WU-TANG MEMBERS )SO YEAH IT IS A LITTLE DISSAPPOINTING BUT THOSE TWO SONG SEND A CLEAR AND STRONG MESSAGE THAT THE NEXT WU-TANG ALBUM WILL PUT THE WU-TANG BACK ON TOP WHERE THEY BELONG. P.S WATCH OUT FOR KILLAH PRIEST ON MAY 9TH FROM THE LAND OF ARABIA I SAY PEACE
5,Phatest Album/Soundtrack of 2000,Ghost Dog The album is very ill. Rza does some of his best production on this Sdtk. Every song is well produced and the artist(mainly undergroung Wu kats) spit tight verses. Rza should be noted highly for his work on this album/sdtk. All songs are ill. The only negitive thing on this masterpiece is all the talking by Forest(but that made it a sdtk I guess). If you like Wu and hip hop with rugged beats don't sleep on Rza's Ghost Dog. No dought one of the best albums of 2000.
1,soundtrack?,"If I could give it negative stars I would. There was not a single song from the movie on this cd. I personally think that most rap is absolutely horrible, but the music in the movie was pretty good, and that's why I bought the soundtrack. Of course pretty much every song on the cd is the same redundant cheaply produced insult to music that pretty much all rap is. I don't understand the logic of calling someting a soundtrack when there's nothing from the movie on it. I think whoever's idea this soundtrack was owes me fifteen dollars."
1,"This isn't the soundtrack, it's a promo album","Take it if somebody gives it to you for free, but don't pay for it under the impression you'll be hearing what you hear in the film."
1,This isn't the soundtrack,"This isn't the soundtrack to the movie, it's a bunch of Wu Tang cuts with a picture of Forrest Wittaker on the cover. Get a better Wu Tang album if you want to hear them."
3,Ghostdog?,"Quite simply, the fact that this cd does not contain the fantastic beats actually used in the movie makes it a sham. Ghostdog was a great independent film, and this album was for some reason watered down to serve a very mainstream audience. If you are looking for the thrilling tracks you heard in the movie, don't buy it. You'll be disappointed. For the rest of you, it is a decent rap/hip-hop cd, if that's all your looking for."
2,"Decent Album, But Where's the Soundtrack?","This has been stated before but it can't be said enough for my tastes. I should have been warned by the title (""The Album"" rather than ""The Soundtrack"") but was blinded by desire-I came out of the theatre loving the movie and was tempted to run down to the late-night record store and buy the soundtrack. The trance/hip-hop feel of the instrumental tracks in the film absolutely evoke another world, and it was that world I wanted to enter, not a mix of obscure (but good, don't get me wrong) hip-hop."
2,READ THIS before you purchase!,This soundtrack is NOT the music you loved in the movie. I'm not certain the tracks on this were even IN the movie. Only buy this if you can get it used for semi-cheap or are a serious fan of the artists on the CD. The CD is such a disappointment. But what an incredibly cool movie.
3,Disappointed it's not the score,"I, like many others here, was expecting this to be RZA's score from the film. I'm disppointed that it is not. The soundtrack from Dead Man is among my favorite records. I love the incorporation of dialogue from the film into Neil Young's music, and I wish they would have done something similar here. That said, I enjoyed several of the tracks, especially Cakes and Samurai Showdown. I'm not all that familiar with RZA's work with the Wu-Tang Clan, but I am interested to hear more of it."
5,CLASSIC!!!,"The movie is great, but the soundtrack is better. If you're looking for the score to the film you've got the wrong album, all of that stuffs on the Japanese import. If you're looking for one of the best hip hop albums no one ever heard, buy this now. Anyone who hates on this album is not a hip hop fan. This album crunches!!!"
4,Nothing to complain about here...,"What a great film! I had to go get the album - then i found out there were 2 albums! At first this pissed me off, i went away and got the japanese import for the instumentals. Excellent album but very short (under 35 minutes) and only 3 songs with speech. After a while i thought i'd get a copy of the more widely available soundtrack (the one above) and let me tell u this: IT IS EXCELLENT!!!. Stange Eyes, 4 Sho Sho, Stay With Me are all really great songs and my personal favourite from the album: Tekitha - Walking Through The Darkness. It uses an excellent sample of Across 110th Street by Bobby Womack with a simple beat.My advice, for those who like good hip hop this album is a great buy. For the die-hard Ghost Dog fans, don't just get the instrumentals, get both!"
4,A good story with good characterization.,"Roy Martin's Whisper My Name provides an ingenious twist on the ageless unrequited love tale by intertwining it with an excellent and believable mystery in a southern small-town setting. The believability of the protagonist & his motivations carries the reader over some bumpy spots caused by stylistic weaknesses and poor editing (as a former English teacher I am perhaps too sensitive to a want for graceful sentence structure, apparently a dying art in our culture). Martin tells a good tale with good characters and wraps it all up with an explosive and unexpected climax."
5,Truly a book to read all night!,"Whisper My Name by Roy Martin is a book that yells ""Read Me, Read Me!"" Once started, it must be finished immediately. The characters become friends and acquaintances from your own past. A tale spun by a master story teller. One caution, read quietly, you don't want some of the characters to hear you breathe."
1,Puree of Bleh,"It is rare that I find a book which I cannot finish.Well this one takes the cake!!Fifty pages and three weeks into it I realized it was just not going to happen. I was thinking up of any excuse, including housework and going to sleep early or staring through the window on the bus way home, anything but reading this horrid book.I think it had too many characters, they sounded forced and fabricated, it was dragging on, and when I flipped through it to read random paragraphs it all read so lukewarm. I felt like I was eating stale bread, and I like juicy good books, so this one went back on the shelf.Too bad, I liked the concept, and the recipe on the back was better than the book itself.Major disappointment there, don't know if I would tackle Bishop's other books."
1,PLEASE - pass the puree!!!,"My Mystery Book group read A Puree of Poison for our January selection and everyone hated it! In a word, it was just silly! We thought that Meg had a case of arrested development with all the tantrums she threw.The other quirky characters seemed more annoying than engaging. We all agreed that Dina, the receptionist, had a big mouth and major attitude problem which no employer in his right mind would have tolerated. I kept hoping for The Donald to pop up and say ""You're fired!!!""I had read the first three books in the series and had really enjoyed them, but Puree was a big disappointment.Also, I think that Claudia Bishop may have lifted the Civil War idea from the TV show ""Ed."" This season ""Ed"" had a similar episode about the reenactment of a Civil War battle which Stuckeyville had supposedly won but actually had lost. Coincidence? Who knows? Just save your time and money and pass on this puree."
3,NOT VERY EFFECTIVE,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IN THE HOPES THAT THE LITTER THAT USUALLY FLIES ALL AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE LITTER BOX WOULD BE SOMEWHAT CONTAINED WITH THIS MAT THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY MADE JUST FOR THAT PURPOSE. I HAD PREVIOUSLY USED A PAPER SHOPPING BAG WHICH ACTUALLY WORKED BETTER THAN THIS PRODUCT DOES, AND IS MUCH EASIER TO HANDLE. BOTTOM LINE - I AM STILL FINDING LITTER ALL AROUND THE BOX - THIS MAT DOES NOT REALLY STOP THAT HAPPENING. IT IS WELL MADE, HOWEVER, AND AT ONLY $4 WITH FREE SHIPPING WAS NOT A BAD INVESTMENT."
4,pet supplies review,"I really didn't get a chance to use this because shortly after I got it,my cat died and I had to throw it out.It did seem like a pretty good mat though."
4,It's alright,"I have both the Haynes and this one but I think I like the Haynes better because it just seems to be a bit more specific on some little details, more pictures, more little tricks on how to make getting it done a bit easier. That's just my opinion though. The Haynes just seems better."
1,Automatic Shutoff,"I find the Cara #53 heating pad unacceptable since it has an automatic shutoff. I did have a Cara #53 heating pad earlier and liked it real well but it had no automatic shutoff. Maybe there is some sort of government regulation that requires that heating pads have an automatic shutoff. In any event, it has become real hard to find one that does not have an automatic shutoff."
5,What if....I hope not...,Makes you really hope that this doesn't happen. We wish for immortality but do we really want it? Blessing or a curse? Ms Due writes a tale reminding me of the finest in almost science fiction. fabulous!
3,Not too bad Ms Due,"The book revolves around the family of Jessica, David and their five-year-old daughter named Kira. What surprised me in the book was that David and Jessica are so opposite to each other on a spiritual basis. While Jessica is highly religious; David is an atheist. But there are significant reasons that shape one's character and for David, it was a simple ritual that changed his life forever, and I mean that literally. It was his deep love for mortals (specifically for Jessica and Kira) that caused the following scenario to occur: someone from David's past attempts to take the lives of his wife and daughter, and the only way David can protect them is by, believe it or not, killing them.There's also something that happens at the end of the second last chapter that was truly heart-breaking and I commend Ms Due for writing that. Life isn't always a fairy-tale."
2,a mediocre tale that doesn't live up to it's true potential.,"This was a quick read for me, but it just didn't leave me thinking afterwards. It is a great concept, immortals living among us, but I think that the author could have done a lot more with it."
1,???????????,"Was everyone else reading the same book as me? I am just baffled over what everyone is raving about. The dialogue was off, Due dwelled on what Jessica thought too much, when she was not the real protagonist in the story.This book was so bad that I hesistated to finish but since I paid way too much money for it, I struggled through it anyway. I've heard people comparing Due's work to Stepheh King's. Please. He has nothing to worry about. The only thing scary about My Soul to Keep is that someone found it worthy of publishing."
5,Captivating!!!,"It's unbelievable!! This book is one of the best I've ever read. I'm hopeful that Ms. Due will write another (I've just purchased ""My Soul to Keep."") I can't wait to get started. I cannot compare Ms. Due's writing to anyone else. I don't know any other author that writes like this. She has a unique writing style of her own.Her character development was very good. She managed to throw in some humor, too. Very well done. What's next Ms. Due?"
2,what's all the hype about?,"More romance than horror, this book is yet another variation on ""they live among us"" theme - be that vampires, undead, or what other supernatural species strikes author's fancy. Writing is very uneven - at times very good, it turned to crass and tawdry at some points. The whole idea of the origin of the ""immortals"" sounds like a B-horror movie.Another problem for me is that this book was designed as the first in a series, hence, the plot is stretched to limits to fill several books, rather than being edited to keep the reader's interest up. I say skip it."
4,One of the best...,"Ms. Due, Ms. Due, Ms. Due... This is a great work of art. A great tale that dates back to biblical times and brings us up to the present. I can't wait for the sequel."
5,One of my favorites....,"I have read this book twice, and still read excerpts at times. Everyone I have shared this book with has loved it. Great work, and a great read. I do not want to give details of the story b/c this is like a good movie, no one should ruin the story for you on this book. Read it, you will love it."
5,An all-time favorite,"I am an avid African American fiction & non-fiction reader. However, I never could get into sci-fi-type novels. My Soul to Keep changed my mind forever. I was hooked before the end of the first chapter, and read it in one night. I wanted more...and got it later. During that first read, I experienced so many different emotions: happiness, fear, anxiety, etc. That's a rare thing for me.I think the problem with the other books that others would compare M S to K to was that the basis of the stories were unbelievable to me. Tananarive Due did an excellent job of making the story believable (at least to me) and taking me on a journey that had me addicted. I cannot wait for the third installment to come out in June!"
5,My Soul To Keep,"Tananrive Due really wrote a wonderful book. I just finished it and I am reeling from it emotionally.It is a whole lot of thiller with a seasoning of a love story.To be honest, this book has me at a lost for words, it really touched me emotionally."
4,"Intense Read, Not My Usual Style","I don't normally read books like this one. It is a horror/suspense/vampire type book that I would normally pass up in the library or bookstore.One of the members in our bookclub, Lakeisha Jones, suggested this selection to the Each One Teach One Book Club when it was her turn to host, and I decided to give it a try. I will say that Tananarive Due is an excellent writer that brings her story across with flair and style. Even though I am not used to reading subjects like this, the way she did it, by giving an African twist to the usual Vampire story, did catch my attention.If I enjoyed vampire or horror stories, it may have gotten a 5 star review from me, but since this is just not my cup of tea, I had to give it a 4 star review because of the wonderful writing ability of the author."
4,There Truly Are No Good Monsters,"I found this book to be absolutely captivating. I don't believe I've ever found myself so anxious to find what will occur next as I did with this novel. I actually had to restrain myself from reading ahead, which was a first.Due's style is well written and flows smoothly. I was drawn to the characters, especially Jessica. To have had such a burden thrust upon her and all because of David's selfishness. He truly was crazy.If you're seeking a suspenseful thrill, this book is without a doubt a must read."
5,I've read it multiple times!,"""My Soul to Keep"" was my first experience with Ms. Due, and it's got me hooked--I absolutely loved it! Ms. Due's powerful writing style allows me to experience the vast range of emotion of the characters each time I read it--sweaty palms, racing heart, tearing eyes, laughter,sadness--I can go on and on. I can't wait to read her other works."
5,My Favorite Tananarive Due Book,"I love everything Tananarive Due has written, but this book is my favorite because of two things: its plot and its opening sequence. I found myself fantasizing about what I would do if I could live forever--for months after I had read the book. I am a writer, and a good deal of what I wrote after reading this book was badly derivative because it had gotten so deep into my head. The opening is perfect. I have my creative writing students read it and then dare them NOT to read the rest of the book. They can't. Nobody can put the book down after reading about a man who ""compassionately"" kills his own nursinghome-bound daughter, a daughter who just happens to be sixty or so years older than her own father. Wow!"
4,INGENIOUS CONCEPT,"My Soul To Keep definitely took me on an experience outside my element. I'm not a sci-fi fan, but this was a worthwhile read that I enjoyed along with The Between (Ms. Due's first novel). The story is about an immortal named David/Dawit who underwent a ritual of the ""Living Blood"", to find out more you MUST read the book because the concept is genious as well as haunting. The book spans over 450 years and covers alot of geographical areas as well as breakthroughs. Ms. Due has crafted a suspenseful and haunting brew of a novel. I'm patiently waiting for the sequel."
5,The man of her dreams?,"Imagine...you meet; you fall in love; you marry; you have a beautiful (and gifted) child.Then you find out your loving spouse has a secret, and wants to initiate you into an ancient covenant that doesn't want you as a member.A seductive and engaging story. This is a book to be read, and shared, and read again."
3,The last of Bayport,"...Chinese Junk does neither, so it sits at a 3 rating. Its worth reading, but ranks among the average of the set. It is an adventerous book, full of that. Little suspense and little mystery however. The publishers in 1959 & 1960 published back to back Nancy Drew & the Hardy Boys stories about Alaska/Hawaii & then added an Oriental book. Drew's The Mystery of the Fire Dragon, published the same year as Chinese Junk, correlates with Chinese Junk. Devil's Paw was about Alaska, and Drew's volume #36 about Hawaii. All this robs from all four volumes. I liked the characters in Chinese Junk. They seemed to have personality. Again average, but worth reading."
4,Signs of the times,This latest book by Ellis Skolfield is a must read for anyone who is interested in the roots and progression of political events today.
5,Pull out the Bible and read the head lines. Best insight Yet!,It was not what I expected. It was scripture based and to the point. I pulled out my scriptures and studied what was being presented. I couldn't put it down. It was laid out in a logical manner. I've studied revelations and end time books as well as the history of Islam in some detail for forty years prior to this reading. This small book tied up a lot of loose ends and revealed a few mysteries.I highly recommend this book. Note: Islam always takes the most holy site of a conquered country and puts a mosque there. That's why the Dome of the Rock exists on the temple mount. It was built to humiliate and show the subjugation of the jews. an Abomination. In my opinion Muhammad going to Jerusalem is a convenient myth to justify it.
1,Didn't get what was ordered,The book I recieved was not the book that I had purchased! The Book I was sent was written by another author....therefore.....wrong book!!!!
1,Don't wast your time or money,I was very disappointed with the scope of this language program. For numbers they only cover 0-20. There is no section on pronunciation. The vocabulary is extremely limited. I found it useless for developing any conversation skills. Unfortunately there are not many options for someone wanting to learn Malagasy.
5,Thought Provoking,"The Meloncholy of Anatomy is one of the most insightful books I've read in a very long time. I was amazed at the use of the metaphorical language pretaining to the view of the stories. This book inspired me to become part of the Skin Project put on by Shelly Jackson, author of this book."
3,"Confusing, but engaging","This is a very intruiging book. I truely can't put it down, and the disturbing images stay with me as I'm trying to sleep. Jackson uses the idea of body and disease in the real, taking physical body attributes and making them hold other characteristics. Cancer fills a room, sperm can be watched in a guppy bowl, and fetuses float through a town. Bizarre, but strangely compelling, and it's definitely something to read more than once."
3,"Wickedly funny, but too short and too narrow a focus","Harry Shearer's ""Le Show"" on NPR (now in its 22nd year of disservice) is a one-man wonder of a thing, featuring the sharpest, smartest satire around. Through marvelous editing, Harry conducts interviews and does sketches, performing all the voices himself. Harry and wife Judith Owen are launching their new Courgette Records label with this release. It's a shame this CD clocks in at just over 40 minutes, and is limited to TV news topics only. Harry's last LS compliation, ""It Must Have Been Something I Said,"" is far superior, and holds up to repeated listening, even over a decade later. I'm still a huge fan of Le Show, I just wished there was more to sink one's teeth into here!"
2,Not Worth it,"I usually really like the Everything series, but this one was a disappointment. it might be something good to read if you are trying to understand bits and pieces of the belief system, but it leaves much to be desired."
5,Was what I expected,This book gives insight into the Wiccan life past ans present. It was great to read for new found knowledge and is great for anyone who is just starting out learning or trying to learn the Wicca way.
3,A good beginner book,"Like most beginner books, it provides a quick survey to different aspects of Wicca and Witchcraft. After reading three books on Wicca, also for beginners, I thought I wasn't gonna learn anything anymore from this book, I was wrong, I still did.The reason I gave it three stars though is because some of the ""facts"" contained are obvious errors, such as Tarot cards having 72 cards instead of 78, and the mismatching of the meaning of the words pentagram and pentacle. Such errors made me question the credibility of other parts of the book.Overall, it is still a good read, and while I think it isn't the best beginner book, I think you can do far worse than to buy this book."
1,Amazon make this confusing!,"This is the second time you could not tell whether the book I am buying is a work book or the one advertised. When it says the hard cover is one price but a paperback edition is much less, but does not say it is not the same book but a work book. Yup I am unhappy with what Amazon sent me."
5,Life At Its Fullest,"This is a GREAT whitewater video! It is especially exciting to see a woman, Shannon, doing these hair raising moves. I held my breath during her rescue with the rope.Tao's record breaking waterfall descent was another TWITCH y moment. Also liked the magnificent scenery."
1,"Contemporary in 1995, maybe...","I was disappointed with this book. Most of the designs are variations on one style of wire-wrapped cabuchon, and I thought they were rather gawdy and dated. The designs were probably innovative and stylish in 1995, but they aren't anything like current trends in wirework."
4,Neat wire wrapping book,"Nice projects, pictures, and wire wrapping advice. My only complaint is all the projects look the same. Not very much artistic expression there, but it's a good book to learn the technique."
3,Contemporary wire wrapped jewelry,Had I known this book wasn't in color I wouldn't have bought it. I don't enjoy looking at black and white pictures because the details aren't as good when learning a new technique. That caused the book to loose points in my rating.
2,"meander, not consistent, overall not great","i bought C++ How to program(textbook for school) and Sam teach yourself C++ 21 day(after failed my c++ class) before this book. After reading reviews for this book, I decide to buy this book for the ""Class, pointer and ADT"" stuff that I didn't get from C++ How to program. After reading some chapters, i found the book is not really for the beginner. I need a book that explains concepts in a clear manner. Absolute C++ fails to achieve that. Now I really don't know what to do with my next class(Data Structure)."
1,Give it up for love,"The only thing I can say about Cassandra's singing is that John Denver must have been drunk - VERY drunk to think she has a good singing voice. Her voice reminds me of a moose bellowing at night. I have since thrown this CD in the trash and I refuse to subject myself to her singing again. I don't see how she has the ""gull"" to still connect to his name. I think she knows she will never have the talent to make it on her own so she chooses to connect herself to John still. I was a fan of John Denver from his first album to his last and I hate seeing his name being used or connected to such as ""untalented"" person as Cassandra. Such a waste!"
1,Terrible,"The lip ease ""cushion"" is not, as one would assume, a protective pillow type object to lesson the irritation from the teeth against the lip; it is, rather, paper. Practically a thinner version of wax paper which (aside from the fact that I can get it from my kitchen drawer), does not stick to the teeth and interferes with the tongue.Not suitable for any kind of brass playing."
3,Not Impressed at All,"I played this game once at a convention, and had previously had a chance to play at a different convention. From what I've actually seen of the rulebook, I don't like paying to play a certain species: I don't care if it's only a point or two. I liked some of the effects of the critical hit system, but I didn't really like the overall dice comparison system because of the lack of modifiers: it's just ""is the result on this die bigger than the one on that one?"" The world seems well detailed, and being given a copy of Scars as an intro helped, but it's just not my kind of system."
4,Want to Salsa?,You can't help but want to dance. Great to excerzie to. The man is one of the all time greats in latin music.
4,"great music, that takes you higher !!!!","its an amazing cd , great tunes , i really enjoy to listen it !!!"
3,Love the cutter but a bit dissapointed,It rusted after washing it for the first time. :) Not a good quality metal so I was dissapointed with this purchase.
5,25 Foot Drain Auger,"I bought this from a local hardware store and it works greatfor clearing tough clogs, especially hair down the tub drain.Usually don't have to go more than 5-6 feet down to clear the blockage.Has paid for itself 10 times over in plumber charges.LDR is a great company that really stands behind their product.The handle mechanism broke off and they replaced the entire unitfor me."
3,Beware!,"There is no faulting these wondeful songs.The only problem is that this is not a ""real"" album - every cut has been released previously, except for two of the three live tracks, so ""Blues At Sunrise"" should really be presented as a compilation of Stevie Ray Vaughan's best slow blues numbers.And as such, it is really too short and too narrow to work as a career retrospective - the double-disc ""The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan And Double Trouble"" is a much better place to start.Or you could just get Vaughan's original four studio albums, and the excellent ""Live Alive"" and ""Live At Montreux""!"
1,"Yet Another ""Cash-in-on-dead-guys"" Compilation","I've been listening to SRV since his demo tape (under the title of ""Double Trouble,"" not SRV & DT) came to Hard Times in Richmond, Virginia, back in '78...back when he was known as ""Jimmie Vaughan's little brother who also plays guitar."" No doubt SRV was a great talent; no doubt his untimely meeting with a manmade mountain in Wisconsin was tragic. But as far as this disc is concerned: it's all been packaged before. Had this disk provided something new tot he SRV library, I would have rated it much higher. As it is, you can get his other albums qutie cheaply and readily and thus hear his music within his context. i heartily recommend all the CDs, especially the live ones. Too, his first CD holds up quite well (it's the one produced by John Hammond Sr.). If you're looking for something fresh and new and still great contemporary guitar blues, check out ""Drive to Survive"" by Jimmy Thackery & the Driver."
3,Rip-Off or Worthwhile Purchase ?,"Having been a fan of Stevie Ray ever since I first saw him live on German television ages ago, I was quite anxious to check out his 'new' album when it came out last week. In a nutshell - if you're a die-hard SRV fan, this album is a must, even though you probably have got most of the tracks already. Especially the title song, a live recording featuring the indestructable Albert King, yet again displays Stevie Ray's outstanding workmanship and may soothe your anger about the fact that they could easily have included some more 'new' material such as alternate or live versions or some more outtakes. All other prospective buyers are well advised: make sure you first get the original stuff released during his lifetime plus the Carnegie Hall live recording before you dare explore the depths of Stevie Ray's Texas blues any further !"
1,"Lousy cheap product, a waste of money","The so-called wig looked nothing like the picture, it actually resembled Samuel L Jackson's hair from Pulp Fiction. The ""hair"" fell out in gobs, it took an hour of primping it to make it look at all usable. I would not recommend this garbage to anyone.Adult 1950s Greaser Wig"
3,Adult 1950's Greaser Wig,"This was a great value for the money, a very good wig..the only issue I had with it is it came all 'smooshed' in the plastic packaging and I had to actually take it out, wet it and restyle it to get it to look like it does in the ad photo! Be prepared to 'style' it when you get it!"
2,Eddie Wig,We were using this wig to play Eddie from Rocky Horror Picture Show. Not bad for that purpose. But trying to fluff this wig back into the greaser shape is very difficult. Don't expect it to look like the picture without alot of effort and may-be some moose.
5,For anyone who has loved and lost,This is a great book. Very helpful in finding the self love it takes to forgive yourself when you fail in a relationship.One of my favorites.
4,Great Couples Tool,"Whether or not you agree with everything said, this is a worthy investment of time and energy."
3,Robbing Stephen Levine,"Welwood is a good writer whose books read smoothly. My problem is that he borrows most of his ideas from people like author Stephen Levine. Read Levine's book ""Embracing the beloved: Relationship as a path of awakening"" or ""Gradual Awakening"" and see what I'm talking about for yourself. Levine's books predate Welwood's by 10 and 30 years so there's no question about whose robbing who."
5,"If there was a t-shirt, I'd wear it.","For heavens sake, give this guy 5 stars, if just for his laugh! He's FUNNY. And for everyone having trouble making their outer life reflect their inner values, this is the answer. You are going to want the printed book, too, once you hear the CD. But don't skip the CD, whatever you do - listening to him is like standing in a shower of magic fairy dust. Or going to church at your neighborhood Cheers. Yeah, I know, metaphors are not my strong suit. Just buy it, the CD, then buy the book."
3,a disappointment,"I've read all of Welwood's books, which I have thoroughly enjoyed, and have been to a workshop with him, based on the material in this book--I think this is the weakest book he has done--his theory is interesting, but I find it overstated, over-applied, to every ill in the world. I think he is generalizing from his own experience (as we all do, to some extent), but has not examined his thesis from a broad enough perspective."
5,"Helpful, have a look at this.",This book has really helped me understand myself and a lot of the relationships I have been in. It is also helping me to have a good one. Have a look at this ladies if you think you deserve something better.
4,Looking for a good book to curl up with?,"Molly Noble Bull's THE WINTER PEARL is the heartwarming tale of a young woman and the cruel uncle who has raised her finding a faith that changes them, bringing happiness beyond their dreams amid the harshness of life in 1888 Colorado. The characters will touch your heart. A cozy read for a long, winter night."
4,A Cozy Read,"The Winter PearlBy: Molly Noble BullIn 1888 a young woman alone in Colorado is always in peril. But Honor McCall has to get away. She escapes her abusive uncle to be injured in a stage coach robbery and rescued by a kind, widowed pastor.She starts a new life healing from her injuries in the boarding house owned by Rev. Jethro Peters' mother. Once healed, she accepts a job at the house. Sure that her uncle will find her she must save enough money to escape again.Love and mercy are two things she never trusted or expected. But she finds both in this gentle family that employs her. Their acceptance draws her to faith and opens her heart to love.Will her past prevent the love she finds in Jethro Peters and the miracle of Christmas? . . .Reading this book is like snuggling up in front of a roaring fire, drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter night. Molly Noble Bull has woven a tender love story out of a harsh wilderness. And, you will be drawn into the hearts of the characters."
3,Predictable!,"It reminded me of an Al and Joana Lacey book, every body gets saved and everybody lives happily ever after. Don't get me wrong, I like happy endings. But when you have a lot of characters Everything and everybody doesn't turn out cozy. I just found this book to be totally predictable. This review is in no way intended to insult the author or to limit God's grace(!!!??). Obviously people like very different books, mine is only one opinion on it."
4,"Wonderful fragrance, but...","...it doesn't last more than 24 hours. I love the fragrance: has been one of my favorites since ever...but this new batch in particular doesn't last on me, like they used to. Are they putting less alcohol in the new ones? what is the difference? I mean, don't get me wrong, it smells awesome, like always, but it doesn't last like before. Are these fragrances originals? Thank you."
5,we loved it,"My wife and I was kept in good suspence woundering what will happen next. It was fun trying to figure out what was gonna happen. If you buy the movie im sure you will like it too. It's just a little bit gory. Ok for the kids. Im sure they will like it also. Who knows, A child probably wont keep quiet about this flick."
4,"fun saturday matinee , friday without a date movie to watch","I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1977 with my brother and uncle! I remember thinking it was awesome then. Now it looks kind of crude but that is part of the appeal! I was excited to see mgm offer it on video a year ago,hope they offer it on dvd soon! Rick Bakers cool melting man efx really carry this film not the amateurish actors. Worth a look for sci-fi and horror fans!"
3,Completely Weird Movie.,"This is one of the first horror movies I saw as a kid back in the 70's. It may not be of the ""best"" quality, but the effects are just plain WEIRD. The melting man's demise alone is worth price of admission."
5,B movie fun but MOD,"I wish Amazon would start listing these DVD-R titles as MOD under ""format"" and not as a DVD. I'm afraid I'll accidently order one of these. Love what's being released and would definitely grab The Incredible Melting Man if made available as a pressed DVD or Blu-ray."
5,Funniest Movie Ever,"Where to begin. For anyone who has ever appreciated an incredibly bad movie, this is for you. Every apparent horror aspect of the movie is done with a comedic touch that screams, ""I didn't mean to make that funny."" The funny part is that they DIDN'T actually try to make this movie funny, it just kind of turned out that way. Ten minutes in to the movie, while I was watching it with my friends for the first time, we ended up rewinding one scene and then rewatching over four times, it was that hillarious. But it wasn't supposed to be! Steve (funny that they call him that in the movie) craves human flesh, but if he is such an evil monster why is he being chased, not the other way around? I won't spoil it for you, but this movie is a must see."
4,Schlock Horror at its BEST!!!!!!!!,"The first time I saw this film, was on the Saturday Afternoon Shockers program in Detroit in the 80's (yes I'm old)The first few scenes of the movie will engage your interest.Unlike alot of Schlock films, this one doesn't take forever before you get to see some action or to see the ""monster"". The plot offers several memorable scenes with extra melty cheese & gore.:) It's almost as if Frankensteins Monster had a kid with a popsicle."
1,Totally Dissapointed in MGM,"This DVD is on a DVD-R!!!! How can MGM get away with that?? The cover looks like cheap print and it just has ""chince"" written all over it. Disgusting!"
3,The makeup is surprisingly effective!!!,"When astronaut Steven West returns to earth from a visit to Saturn, he brings back with him a horrible disease that very literally begins melting away his flesh! This hideous affliction is further worsened when the poor man realizes he must turn cannibal in order to survive.William Sachs directs from a screenplay that, believe it or not, updates the old 1950's sci-fi film ""First Man Into Space."" I personally got a rise out of Rick Baker's gory special effects. To say they're merely convincing would be an understatement. The stuff on display in this flick is positively unsettling! For a movie released in the late 70's, this really delivers the gruesome goods. While the story's premise may seem laughable, at times even more farfetched, the tried and true horror buff should find something to savor here. The ending is a particular sight to behold. One, I'm sure, you'll never forget."
2,"Missing the English word ""tree""?","En serio. Goes from ""treaty"" to ""trek"". That seems pretty sloppy. My old Cassel's contains 5 other words there besides ""tree"". We're talking typos too. How do you have typos in an age of computer spell checking? I'm not saying it isn't useful -- it's light, it has alot of words, it has idiomatic usage, pronunciation, irregular verb conjugation. But there's something about seeing a typo in a language reference book that kind of puts you off. Valazquez *claims* (in large type on their cover) to be the ""preeminent authority"" in spanish/english dictionaries for 150 years. Imagine a book that took a bunch of people 150 years to write. This is not that book."
3,Promising characters that never flesh out,"This book started off well with some very intrigueing characters like Sir Simeon, his son and Mimi Breeze. Lots of history there that is never quite explained. The club itself seems fantastical to the extreme, not at all believable. If the story had focused on the four main characters and left out throwing in and out more sexual partners, it would have worked much better. I also do not like to read about a heroine who gets off on having sex with men she doesn't see or know or even recognize from previous encounters. The story hinted at romantic themes in the beginning, but by the end it was pretty much just sex with anyone/anytime"
1,This book had so much potential,The author obviously does not have any training in qualitative research. If she would have remained objective in her presentation and comments this would have been a very good book. My suggestion is to solicit the services of a good editor and rewrite the book.
5,Fallin' A Risin' Hit,"Alicia Keys' single ""Fallin'"" may surprise some people as being capable of cracking through the Top 20 of the Billboard Charts. Yes, this girl can do it all. She's talented, beautiful, and can play the piano. She proves that a slow paced R&B single is able to do many things, with powerful words and a strong voice. Though at times, it makes you think (eww, that dreadful feeling) you can't help but enjoy someone other than Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera."
2,Where is James Brown's Pay Check?,"this song has gave Alicia Keys many Awards&alot of Record Sales.but the Melody&Vibe is a Rip of James Brown's ""It's a Man's World"".I Mean She Jacked James Brown&Nobody is crying wolf about it&while James has gotten Ripped off behind Rappers not Properly Credting Him&what not you would think that going after JB's Music had ended 10 years back? but it hasn't.Vocally She never fully brings the Soul to the Song.I Give Her credit for playing but overall it's just another Pawn Jacking James Brown thought that ended with Porperly crediting Artists but I guess not."
2,Not that great,"Yeah, when I first heard this song, I thought it was okay, it's basically like any other R & B song out there. But now that it has been played on MTV and, VH1 and almost every single radio station in America, I'm sorry, but I am sick of it! It's actually pretty snore-inducing when you listen to it, and Alicia Keys is very talented and beautiful, and she's awesome at the piano, but I'm sorry: this song is just plain BORING! It's depressing, too. Definitely not a good picker-upper song. But hey, there are a lot of people out there that worship the ground she walks on, and I say ""To each man (or woman!) his own,"" and I certainly am not criticizing of their taste, but I'm just saying that I don't share their viewpoint! Thanks for reading."
4,for classrooms,"I bought this book to add to my collection of books on oceans for my classroom. The book is very informative and has great illustrations. However, the little hard back in only about the size of the palm of my hand which makes it difficult in the classroom for me to read it to them because they want to see the pictures and it gets lost in the scuffle of classroom use."
5,"Hard to find, but a must read","Anyone who is concerned with Jewish - Christian dialogue, or the Judaic origins of Christianity and the continuing threads that bind these two religions should read Rivkin's book. Because it contains several papers covering some of the same ground, there is a bit of overlap in content. I'm using this book and other materials in a monthly theological discussion group.JBG 12-4-12Northern CA"
2,Rebel without a cause,"""May Morning"" centers on the conflict surrounding an italian student, Valerio,(Alessio Orano) who cannot fit into undergraduate life at Oxford University by refusing to conform with college tradition and code of behavior. With his unconventional attitude, Valerio is destined to produce unexpected and sometimes tragic results.This is surely a cult movie for those who like the 70's, especially because of the good soundtrack, composed by The Tremeloes. The casting is fine, but I belive the plot could be better than it is. When I first saw the DVD case, I did not know what to expect, mainly because I never read a critic about this movie. I can assure you this film is not recommended for those who dislike violent films.In my opinion, the DVD version lacks some technical details. The british accent is very strong and the movie is dubbed most part of the time, which makes it hard to fully understand what the cast is saying."
4,Good quality lamp,Good quality lamp for the price. Kind of dark in color but is very sleek and sophisticated. The 3-way lighting is also a good feature. I'm very satisfied overall.
4,its a keeper,"We had second thoughts when we saw how tall these were. For some reason, we thought they'd be taller. They're 5 feet tall, and sturdy. Kind of roughly finished. Not bad. Works fine."
3,Just Ok,"Received as a gift. It is fine, but certainly not as nice as pictured. The finish was scratched in many places and worn off. But all in all fine for my needs. Not the easiest to assemble."
3,"Too hot lid knob, too cool thermostat setting.","I purchased this item to replace my 25-year old Farberware electric skillet. The stainless steel cooking surface is much better than the non-stick coating found in other skillets because I can use metal utensils and it cleans up wonderfully. However, the legs are in a one piece ""x"" and seem more fragile than the old four separate legs on the old models. I also must set the thermostat quite a bit higher than a recipe (and my experience) calls for in order to reach the correct cooking temperature. It seems to be around 25 to 40 degrees off. The most serious and potentially dangerous feature is the metal knob/handle on top of the lid. It gets very hot, unlike the old melmac-like handles. I have burned my hand several times on this knob. It takes awhile to re-program my thinking to pick up a hot pad before lifting the lid. I recommend this product with reservations because of the hot lid knob. Perhaps you can find an old knob that will fit this skillet."
5,patterns of fashion 1 1660-1860,recieved the book fast and in excellant condition will use it for years to come
5,Patterns of Fashion !,"This is a gift to my daughter, it came in a timely manner, she will be better quailified to review it. Looked good to me."
5,Exceptional,"Janet Arnold is the preemminent clothing historian of our day. As with all of her books she has provided a concise reference to the garments of the period in question, listing the fabrics, colors and cuts that are appropriate for the given garments. Also typical of Arnold books is the scale patterns for the given garments in the back of each text, so, with an understanding of pattern drafting one can easily reproduce the garments from the book as well as size the garment for a particular wearer. As with many of Ms. Arnold books she draws examples from extant examples taken from trunks and in some cases the casket. Another exceptional book by Janet Arnold for the clothing historian or the obsessive compulsive costumer."
5,An Unequaled Resource,"It was with great reverance that I approached my first look at the Patterns of Fashoion. I have heard so many great things that I was almost afraid I would be disappointed. Not so, this book has exceeded my wildest expectations. I own at least a score of books on Tudor/Elizabethan clothing or general costuming and can resolutely say that there is no equal to this book when it comes to detailed exactly how a garment was constructed. Each piece of extant clothing is given multiple pictures and the most detailed descriptions of any book I've seen. While this is not a guide that may interest the average costumer ...if you're serious about period costuming this is your resource."
4,Frankie Go Boom! Really Funny,I'm a big Charlie Hunnam fan and love him in Sons of Anarchy. Ron Pearlman was hilarious. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.
2,Disappointing,"Quirky, but generally the same old annoying miscommunication in romance plot with plenty of characters to get in the way of a meaningful connection."
2,Kinda boring...,"I rented this because it had an interesting premise. I think they could've done more with this. I really wanted to like it, but I was mostly bored."
5,Whispers through time and space,"I read this enchanting book and couldn't help but notice the beautiful artwork as well. It looks as if she put an incredible amount of passion and thought into this book. This is a very unusual book because it is not just poetry; it also has a short story for everyone including children.I read this book to my nephew often and he really enjoys the story about Shilo.I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is easy to read and my nephew keeps asking me to read him the story about Shilo, so I guess the kids love it too. The poetry is beautiful and I can't wait to see when her next book comes out!"
4,Hot Lyrics,"This hot compilation CD is strictly for the streets. This is real hip-hop, not that bubble gum radio friendly pop-hop. One of the funniest tracks on the album is ""Hang Up."" This song is pretty hot lyrically, but the production sounds like it is a demo to an extent. They really try to cater to the men, so much so that they might alienate some women who don't like to like to hear the word ""hoe,"" quite so much. This CD is rugged and street and people who crave some real udnerground hip-hop will eat this up. Stand out cut's include ""Hang Up,"" ""Number 1,"" and ""Dat's Fa Sho."" This CD is okay, but the production sounds a bit unprofessional at time. The most likely radio hit on this CD is ""Somethin Good"" featuring the Dramatics. The main thing about this CD that stuck out is the hot lyrics, the lyrics were off the hook at times."
3,"nice suntan oil scene, otherwise a disappointment",I'm reluctantly giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because the suntan oil massage scene was tender and sweet; however there just wasn't much of a storyline here at all. The opening segment was totally stupid and the weird narration added absolutely nothing to the film.I've seen some great gay movies from the Philippines but this wasn't really a movie and it wasn't great by any means. I do wish that the AMAZON listing for SOPHOMORE had told the buyer what to expect: a rather run-of-the-mill piece of VERY softcore fluff.
5,"Oh, boys...","Pal and gal are both attracted to a lad who gives advances to both of them - and later refuses either of them because of his true sex nature and a social awareness surely.If something could be improved, it is an actress chosen, playing a much younger twenty five year old character, an age she passed visually years ago-it seems, she was a mother of one of characters played by the same male actors inI Killed My Mother ( J'ai tué ma mère ).Xavier Dolan is really it, anyway."
2,Not very good!,"Copyright 1929 by Short Stories, Inc., may explain why this is not a very good book, especially for Ernest Haycox, possibly a short story with added content, the story of Hugh Kingmead returning to Sun Ford, Oregon, after 8 years as a stockbroker in New York City to clear his name of being the killer of Colonel Starrett,"
3,"Not bad, overlooked but somewhat generic hair metal","There are some decent tunes on here, especially side 1 and the ballad ""Broken TOys""This band, unfortunately, were sadly overlooked when they came out....they didnt have much to differentiate themselves from the hair metal fare of the day."
2,Def Leppard wannabees,"Not a bad album, if you strip away the 45 keyboard and vocal overdubs that obscure some decent rockers like ""Overheated"". Broken Toys is a surprisingly poignant, personal slow tempo tune that is similarly produced to the point of death. Trivia: keyboardist Eddie Wohl went on to play guitar in the too-late-to the party grunge-wannabees Redbelly (think he's ready to join a boy band now?). And what's with the name ""Dave Clark Howell""? Like someone might confuse him with the guy from the Dave Clark 5? Is either Dave Howell or Clark Howell not Hollywood enough?"
3,Scooby Doo in the 21st Century,"An updated version of the old gang with current technology and clever stories which are mostly faithful to the Scooby-Dooby-Doo of old. Entertaining and my children (12, 7, 3, and 2) greatly enjoy the CD. I was looking for the original versions and failed to recognize up front what I was buying, but no regrets."
1,Not the old Scooby Doo!,"I bought this thinking I was buying the old scooby doo that I watched when I was a kid. I wish I had looked closer because its a ""new"" version of Scooby Doo and they have ""new"" language too - like ""jerk"" and ""stupid"". I was not impressed. I will probably lose this DVD and buy the real first season."
1,"The Real Scooby Doo, Where are You?","What an awful show. The voices are NOTHING like the original, and the plots are lame. WB was trying to fix something thats wasent broken!

1,Very disappointed !!,"I have bought Burberry before and I absolutely love this perfume. However, I am pretty sure this bottle was watered down somehow. I sprayed on and I swear about 2 hrs later I cannot even smell it anymore. I tried again this morning and same thing. This is very disappointing that you pay so much and get a bad product. Please do not buy from this seller at all. I certainly recommend this perfume but not the seller."
5,All Good,All good. Wife Happy. Very good price. Delivered on time. Product delivered as expected and so far no negative surprises. This one is ok. Good buy!!
1,Talk about copyright infringment....,"I bought this book in its first printing back in the 80's. It is INCREDIBLE. The single best work about shelby american automobiles, PERIOD. My original book literally fell apart from use! That original book was lost some 20 years ago, and I have always wanted another. I contacted SAAC, and they told me the book was no longer available. Well one day, I find a NEW one available here on Amazon. Awesome!!!! I wasted no time in ordering it. When it arrived....it is a COPY. A COPY! It is a copy of an original book, complete with coffee stains, yellowing, age marks from light, etc. The print isnt even lined up squarely with the pages. The photographs, priceless in the original book, are terrible in this one. Some are so dark, they are not even legible. The pages themselves are shiny and clean, but they are shiny, clean COPIES of not-so-clean originals. I wonder if Richard Kopec is aware of this abomination of his original work?"
4,200 ways to score,"It gives 200 ways to get women. Some of the ways of meeting women are good. Some, in my opinion, sound desperate. For example, writing your number on a bunch of helium balloons and releasing them? I don't see any hot women falling for that, sorry. You may get calls from transsexuals or roseanne barr look alikes, though. This book would be great for the guy who wants to get as many women as possible, regardless of the method, regardless of how good the woman is. Some methods are clean and lack getting the girl emotionally involved with you but some can be messy, are designed to deceive, and hurt the women. Some are hillarious. Dating a hooker and getting it on for free? There are plenty of gems in the book though and therefore it is worth reading. Note: you will only get ideas in this book, not how you actually strike up a conversation or say the right things."
1,misleading title,"You'd never know there were 100 women interviewed or that they said anything at all to the author.I thought this book could give some insight to the female mindset, especially in situations where they're being approached, but alas, it's 200 high school cookie-cutter tricks for approaching women."
3,Good book,This book does a good job but The System by Roy Valentine is still the best book I've read on the subject matter.
5,WOW,"Part One of this book, ""Getting You Ready for Part Two"", is about the best thing I've ever seen written when it comes to giving a man the confidence he will need to go about picking up women. After reading Part One, I felt as if I could pick up any woman, any time, any place! I especially liked the following chapters: Pick Up Attitute, The Art of Conversation, Imagination, Nerve, Move Quick - Don't Hesitate, How to Turn a Turn Down into a Turn On, Asking a Girl Out, and Successful with Women - Successful with Your Career.I also gained a lot of knowledge about women in general from the ""64"" thoughts and suggestions given to help make you more successful with women.Now that I've finished reading this book (for the 3rd time), I'm more than ready to get started trying out some of the pick up ideas given in the book"
3,yeah whatever.,"It's a funny book. Which is really the best you can hope for in this type of literature. If you are really hinging your hopes of scoring on a book - well just buck up and hire a pro. seriously. And toss that guilt out the window about it. This book ain't gonna change your life - but for what it is, it did make me chuckle now and again."
2,A waste of money,"After I read this book I got the feeling that if this man had spent more time working on this book instead of trying to pick up women he could have written a much better book. This book has a few good recommendation in it but not enough to justify the price. There are much better books on the subject of meeting and dating women. ""How to succeed with women"" by Ron Louis and David Copeland is my recommendation. It's cheaper and gives 100 times more practical advice. If you find ""Over 200 Proven Ways and Places to Pick Up Girls "" on sale for a $1 somewhere go ahead and buy it. Otherwise don't waste your money."
5,HEAVENLY,"It's a shame this book is out of print. Used ones are available, and it is worth purchasing.With this book, Karen Ranney gives us a glimpse into an historical period where women suffer abuse and neglect in the guise of marriage. Kathryn is one of these women who, after her husband dies, takes advantage of an opportunity to change her life, only to be caught in another marriage web. Kathryn is flawed but deserving, and we follow her choices with compassion.One of her choices is Hugh. With description as only Ranney can deliver, we ""feel"" the attraction between Kathryn and Hugh from chapter one and are drawn through the book by their sensual magnetism. In a brutal world filled with life and death choices, Kathryn and Hugh search the heavens for understanding and truth, and that is where their story rests...among the stars."
2,Morose,"Sad, whiney, why me, why me!!!! That's what this book was full of! While not a champion for adultery in real life I don't mind in fiction. However, don't whine & complain about doing it!!! Particularly when YOU KNOW your hearts not torn. Steamy scenes gotme through it. Although I think the last quarter of the book was an unnecessary circle. Couldve been shorter by 100 pages."
3,"OK book, but...","This was a well written book, with characters that I found very interesting. The chemistry between the hero and heroine was intense, as was their lovemaking. In most situations this would be a four-star book for me and maybe even go on my keeper shelf. But this story glorifies adultery, and to me that is wrong. Especially considering that the hero's wife is a nice person and not at all deserving of her husband's disloyalty. As a wife who values her husband's fidelity, I could not sympathize with the couple in this story and was disappointed that the author expected me to. I finished it only because I wanted to give it an honest review."
2,Snoozer,I really enjoyed the first book written by this author but I found This book boring and couldn't even finish it. I would recommend skipping this one!
5,Laugh til it hurts,Mr. Pinsky has unique perspective on parenthood and his razor sharp prose will keep you laughing for hours. I nearly wet my pants at one point. If you're a parent and up for a good laugh - read this book!
5,What a great deal!,"I love this rug. The colors are beautiful and it's thick and plush, so it's very comfortable to sit and lay on. After puchasing the 5' x 7.5', I was so impressed that I purchased three more. I had planned to put non-slip protectors under them because I have them on wood floors, but they do not slip around. Excellent price, super fast shipping and pretty, too! I would recommend this rug, this brand and this seller."
2,pretty nice rug,"The rug is very well made and very soft. The picture on Amazon seems a little deceiving, because it looks so rusty/red/brick. In our house, it looks very navy and dark brown. Doesn't matter, i still like it.It also has more of a 'southwest' feel to a number of the squares in the pattern. I wouldn't have picked it out in person for that reason.The thing i'd actually really complain about is that it shows EVERY tiny speck of lint and dirt. Everyone else I know gets area rugs to help hide the wear and tear in high-foot-traffic areas. This one I find myself asking people to stay off of b/c I have to vacuum it for it to look decent...."
3,Hard to Say,"I was a little disappointed in this book. It is actually smaller than I expected. The section on Current Therapies for Progres- sive MS is about two pages long and basically says.....there are, currently, no treatments for progressive MS. The rest of the book deals w/ symptom management, most of which I was already familiar with (which drugs were regularly prescribed for which complaints, gimmicks that were helpful in dealing w/ incontinence, how to incorporate a bowel regimen, etc.)In other words, I found nothing new in this book: just a lot of things to do to make us feel like all is not lost. Unfortunately, filling my day with regimens and symptom management activities is not what I call Meeting the Challenge. I think of it more as surrendering to the Drudgery. The book didn't give me cause to feel hopeful nor did it give me any new information that I could take w/ me to my next neurologist appointment. I was disappointed."
4,"good preface;summarizes the ""unspoken""Italian experience","It is diificult to put together a ""list"";it can never accurately reflect the depth of accomplishment by those not so prominent to make it.The preface reflects this concern and sets out a useful perspective on the Italian experience that might not be shared by all those in the book,With some exceptions(ie,Francis Ford Capolla),the list is a solid one."
2,Disappointing,"A view of the Titanic from the perspective of Southampton and its people, mostly represented among the crew. Lots of contemporary pictures and overwhelming minutiae, often quite tedius. Not good for the casual reader, although could be quite valuable to someone looking for insight. The biggest shortcoming, all too frequent with books about this event, is a nearly complete absence of criticism of the behavior of the crew and the ship's owners and an ad nauseum repetition of the same well known stories of glory."
1,Terribly edited book,"This book is written in a disjointed fashion. There is no theme, just mish-mash. And the few people mentioned in the books we have heard the stories before. The few people they mention over and over again in Titanic Voices were too loud. They needed to turn the volume down."
5,Inspirational Writing and Beautiful Images,This book is a 'must have' for anyone who loves gardening!
4,"Grass,a funny, entertaining compilation with a message!","You've probably never seen the movie ""Grass"" and with the limited distribution it is receiving,you might never see it. This is a true shame because it is a film with a powerful message and the message is that for all the anti-drug hype through which we now struggle, Marijuana use is not only not new, but it's use has been a catalyst for artist and the general population for countless years. See the video when it becomes available and at the very least, get the soundtrack and enjoy these funny and often thought provoking songs."
1,"Waste of time - If it was more expensive, it would be a waste of money as well","Take away the lists of books he has written and the ""book"" is 363 words, and those are just about how he never got famous. I wouldnt be purchasing ebooks if he was famous. This ebook is the dumbest thing since butt juice."
1,Excel For Engineers,"If you want an introductory book on Excel there are a plethora of superior ones available. If you want a book that demonstrates Excel's engineering capabilities, as the title suggests, look elsewhere. This book has little substance. One star is one too many."
3,"Highly detailed, factual, but not the charmer.","Having read David Fisher's ""Summer Bright and Terrible"" and its even better predecessor ""A Race on the Edge of Time,"" both of which deal with the singular importance of radar in saving Britain and, thus, Western Civilization from the wretched Nazis, I was hoping to recapture the excitement of those times in this work. Unfortunately, while ""The Most Dangerous Enemy"" had all of Fisher's facts--and lots more--it never managed to convey either Fisher's sense of immediacy or the fullness of the players in that civilization-defining epoch. If you're writing a paper on the era, Dangerous Enemy is your better source book. But if you want a story that excites your mind and engages your emotions, be sure to get one of Fisher's books, preferably ""A Race..."""
5,The Battle of Britain revisited,This book details the organization of Fighter Command prior to the Battle of Britain and then documents how it functioned in action during the battle. The real heroes here are Dowding who created Fighter Command and Keith Park who commanded 11 Group which was responsible for the crucial airspace over southern England where the bulk of the battle was fought. There are plenty of personal stories of pilots and a good amount of the book is devoted to the aircraft of both sides. The Luftwaffe command structure is also detailed and the strategies of the German commanders analyzed. I found the book riveting and could not put it down even though before reading it I already knew (or thought I knew) a lot about the Battle of Britain. After the critical period was over Dowding was removed as chief of Fighter Command and Park was transferred out of 11 Group - poor rewards for their efforts. This book attempts to set the record straight and give appropriate credit to them.
4,Most Dangerous Enemy,"I have read a number of accounts of the ""Battle of Britain"" and watched a number of documentaries.Stephen Bungay's book brings everything together and from now on will be my bible of the battle"
5,The best Ismael Lo album,"Melifluous, gentle balads with bags of atmosphere. This was a big hit in 1988 in the Senegambia so I assume that the quoted release date simply refers to a new re-issue."
4,CHECK OUT,"Bought at COSTCO before the holidays for $350 or so, included carrying bag, two noise suppression headphones (cheap, uncomfortable, but work good), cords and of course 10.2 player. Great picture, all the bells and whistles of other top brands. Bottom line is LARGE screen, with all necessary features, for lower price. Have used for two long trips, including a trip to Hawaii with three kids beating on it and the DVD player survived even if I didn't. Check out when shopping for a player. Only negatives are it's a bit heavy due to the large battery pack and sound through built in speakers is pretty soft. Sound through headsets or hooked to soundsystem works fine."
1,This DVD player has never worked right.,"We have never been able to get our MDP-1010 DVD player to work. Strangely, it will only play movies that have no commercials on them. That means we can only watch old movies like ""The Princess Bride"" or ""The Last Unicorn."" All of our newer movies like ""Shrek2"" have commercials on them and the player will ONLY play the commercials and not the movie. I called Mintek a couple of weeks ago for service and was told I'd receive a call back within 48 hours -- still haven't heard from them. If there were a choice of ""0"" for stars, that's what I'd give Mintek."
5,Excellent Album,"I picked up this album on (mumble something - indie website, which I like, but wouldn't be cool to mention here). I am really happy that this is available on Amazon too! The group deserves the exposure.I have actually purchased this album twice - which is saying a lot in this day and age of ""rip-and-share"".What do I like? What do I know - I am not a music critic, so words fail me... nice melodies, great singing and lyrical pacing (Crush). Funny and thoughtful lyrics. All of it. This album is regularly enjoyed by both myself and my kids.It is very rare to find an album where every single track is enjoyable - and half of them are downright great (Especially Crush, Hey Darwin, Eden, and (oddly) The Onceler)!Thank you, Solving for X - for a great album. I hope there is more to come!"
2,Not a very good one,"I think that this soundtrack is quite relaxing. However, each track is too short. It only contains an average of 2 minutes for each track. After one track of little enjoyment, then it will fly to another track. I think each track should be longer than 2 minutes in order to make this work."
2,Typical misunderstanding,Dear Katie!This cd contains the musical score of the film. Not the songs. Its pretty lame that you miss the lyrics from an orginial score :)Csaba
3,Great toy! But it doesn't last.,"I have a German Shepherd/Malamute mix and this is her favorite toy. As dog toys go, this is a great one. A tennis ball that squeaks! I wish I'd thought of it. However, be prepared to buy these in bulk as my dog goes through one in just a couple of days. The construction seems to be less than that of regular tennis balls and after a couple of hours of chewing, the ball will stop squeaking. Then break down altogether. I bought a three pack of them last weekend and my dog has already chewed through one.This toy would be fantastic if only it were better constructed. Too bad."
2,less than an hour...,"I love kong, and my dogs love squeakers.I was super exicted when we found these, and i picked up a three pack. Much to my shagrin all three balls had stopped squeaking in less than an hour, and my border collie cross and cattle dog were a little dissapointed that they no longer worked. They obviously still function as a retrieval toy but its sad that they didnt last longer. Great idea, just needs to be redone to be tougher, especialy coming from a company like kong."
1,not worth the money,The squeakers in this tennis ball are not very good; all 4 were broken with in a minute. The concept is cool; they just need to make the squeaker stronger.
1,"It broke, breaking my dog's heart","My springer spaniel loves tennis balls. He loves them more than food, sticks, people or even other dogs. He walks around constantly with tennis balls; shoves tennis balls under furniture and barks at them to force us to retrieve them; and dives into blackberry brambles to retrieve loose tennis balls. We have never discovered the limit of his desire to retrieve tennis balls from a lake because we've never had the patience to throw a ball that many times (and we've tried...).So I was excited to get a tennis ball from the trusted Kong brand that also squeaked. Sounded like Springer heaven. And, for a few days, this was his favorite ball. But then it broke in half, breaking his heart and mine. Now he is down to his last 20 or 30 tennis balls -- hardly enough to keep him occupied (a dog needs what he needs).Really, it should last much longer."
1,NOT SAFE FOR SHIH-TZUS....,"My 12 pd Shih-Tzu worked on this with his small teeth and the squeak was gone w/in 15 min and he tore the covering 1/4 w/in an hour. He was working on getting those small pieces out. Not safe for dog or small children. I wonder what sort of glue is used, especially since I read here that it is made in China.Do not waste your money."
3,My 2 dogs love the Squeaker Ball,"My 2 dogs love the Squeaker Ball but the plastic piece falls into the ball within minutes of using a new one. So I cut an old ball open and used the plastic squeaker in the newer one by putting Krazy glue around the hole and pushing the plastic piece into it. If Kong would use this method to begin with, they would sell more balls."
3,Durable Ball - Not Durable Squeaker,"This ball is a fun toy for our Miniature Pinscher. Even though he somehow managed to bite through the ball and ruin the squeaker within 15 minutes, the ball has been in perfect shape for weeks. We are glad that it's lasting so long since our dog is really rough with his toys.I would give the toy a better rating if the squeaker had been more resistant."
3,ok ball,"This ball was fun for a few minutes for my bulldog, who quickly destroyed the squeaker, and soon also tore the felt off the outside. It would be a good ball for less agressive chewers, and was good for the price, but I would not get one again."
2,Squeaker soon breaks,"The title says it all. The dogs still love to play with them after they quit making sounds but they were much more excited/happy when they were squeaking.The best squeaker toys we've used are made by Dr. Noy's. They have replaceable squeakers but so far we haven't needed to replace them. Our dogs have a habit of disemboweling squeaky toys to get at the noise makers. This hasn't been a problem, surprisingly, with Dr. Noy's toys."
2,Nice Toy for 3 Hours,"Maybe my dogs are just really bored, but the fact that my 14 pound beagle was able to bust a hole in this ball, and then have my black lab/border collie mix gut the squeaker out within 3 hours is insane. So the nice new ball is now in the trash as there is a 1 1/2 inch hole in it. Like I said, it was fun while it lasted, now it's on the way to the city dump."
3,Medium is not really medium,"Just a heads up for anyone getting medium size because it sounds like it'd be smaller than a regular size tennis ball yet not small enough for your dog to eat it, it's not. This is the same size as a regular tennis ball. What's upsetting me now is that Amazon is no longer selling the small size at this moment. Only large (I wonder how big that'll be) and extra small."
2,"My dog loved it, but it fell apart really fast.","My dog loved this toy, I think mostly because it squeaks really loud. The only problem was that she was able to start pulling off the green fuzz within about five minutes--big gobs of it, not just a strand here and there. I wound up having to take the ball away from her after a little while because I was afraid she'd choke on all the fuzz. She's not a very strong chewer, so if your dog has strong jaws I'd get a different toy."
2,Fun for a bit,Our 13 month old Golden was able to push the squeaker in and and rip this ball apart in one day.He loved it but I wouldn't buy it again. Im going to stick to good old regular tennis balls.
2,Useless squeakers!,"I have finally written to the Kong company to complain about the squeakers breaking so quickly under normal use. As so many people have already had problems with this, I'm guessing Kong doesn't really care. My dog still enjoys the ball's action, so I gave it 2 stars, but it's easy to see he misses the squeaker."
1,Buy regular tennis balls!,The squeaker lasts about a minute so buy regular tennis balls for a lot less money and much stronger especially for larger dogs!
2,Fuzz comes off,"The balls bounce well and the squeak adds a fun touch, but my puppy ripped the outer cover fuzz off this ball in about 2 minutes."
2,Not as advertised,"This item as advertised as 48 pieces, thought I stumbled upon greatest deal ever.Actually it is one ball.cheaper to buy 3 pack. My dog does love these balls but the squeaker tends to come out after not very long."
3,Dogs love them....but squeaking ends too fast,"Our dogs LOVE these balls....especially since one of our dog's mouth is too small for a regular tennis ball. They love the squeaking part. However, after about 30 minutes to an hour of playing with them...they stop squeaking. I emailed KONG about this, and they said that they balls should only be used when played with....and not just to let the dogs have. Which...that's what we did. They sent me coupons for more...but needless to say, those only lasted about an hour as well."
1,Bad product dangerous,"The plastic squeaker piece broke in two days and i found the dog chewing it. The yellow skin comes off in a few days and she chews on that. Cant find some of it she may have ate it. Get a real tennis ball , much more durable."
3,"KONG Air Dog Squeakair Tennis Ball Bulk Dog Toy, Medium, Yellow","We have a black lab so I thought the ""medium"" size would be bigger than a regular tennis ball, but it turns out it's the exact same size. I should have bought the large."
5,This book helped my son get a better job!,"I love this book. I had read it myself and when my son lost his job, I gave it to him. He said it really helped him figure out how to use his contacts and do the kind of networking that paid off. Also, I love the way the book is laid out. It's easy to go through and pick out what is particularly relevant to you. Easy reading yet filled with solid information, the kind of help that does pay off. I highly recommend."
5,scool may be bouring but they know what's good for you,"I thought this book was great for kids my age. (preteens)I loved the friendship going on between Dara and jantu, I wish I could have a friendship like that. I can't fell the pain that dara and jantu went through. I can't imagine going through that being on the border, being in the middle of a war, getting lost, being alone, my best friend gettig shot and died. heres the morral to the story (the magic is the making of the marble this book was the best book take a little of your time and read it you'll see what I mean!!!pass the book on!"
3,I thought this book was ok.,"I sort of like this book because there was a little action in it, and if there was any the author descibed it very weel. I didn't like yhis book because it was to predictable, like when Dara's family comes to the refugee camp it was predictable that she would meet someone she liked and would be friends with."
3,I thought that this boo was ok,The book The claymarble in my opinion was a good book.The part i liked the most was when Dara and her family first came to the boarder they felt good dispite the fact that the war was going on and their father figure and a husband died just days earlier and all the bloodshed that was accuring at that very moment.It made them feel good because it was like home.The book didn't have enough action but I learned alot from it.
3,I thought that this book was pretty good...,"I sort of liked this book, because I liked reading about the war, and reading about how people delt with it. I also thought that this book in a way was sad, but it isn't anything that you would ball over. The book was interesting, and it keeps you at the end of your seat. I am glad that Mingfong Ho wrote a book about her experience in the camps. The book is about a war that started when the antagonist, The Khmer Rouge, attacked Cambodia. Then people fled to concentration camps, and tried to live a normal life. I like the fact that it is based on some what of a real story, and I would recommend it."
3,It was an okay book,"When i read the book THE CLAY MARBLE i thought that it was an okay book. The parts that i like about this book are, the family crossed the border and they got out of Cambodia alive, the family met nice people. Theres a girl named Jantu who takes care of a baby named Nabuy"
1,The good beginning,In the beginning of the book Dara has a great time with Jantu. They enjoy making clay dolls and other toys. Dara knows that this joy through the camp will not last and she is correct! I find this part of the book incredibly boring because there is n troubles at all. Even near the middle of the book where there is lots of problems it is increadibly boring.
4,The Clay Marble- a wondferful book,"I really enjoyed this book. we were required to read it this year, but i enjoyed it any way. I will have to admit at first i hated it to all extent, but soon it started to get better. I loved how it was very discriptive and made you feel like you were apart of the story. I loved how the characters grew and learned how to survive at a different place. The characters all showed many emotrions making the book even more exciting. This story showed me there is more to life than fun and games. I would request this story to everyone and hope that if you read it you will enjoy it as much as I did."
5,A story about a girl struggles to survive during the war,"Dara, a Canbodian girl, is a refugee from Cambodia. To get food supply and rice seeds, her family, who lost a father, was travelling to the border between Cambodia and Thailand, where the refugee camp was. As first in the refugee camp, it was quite peace and there was no fighting. Dara and her family lived there peacefully. But when they were about to leave for their home, fighting broke out in the camp. In the disorder, Dara got lost and then...It is a great book I have ever read. I especially recommend this book to those readers who are interested in a refugees problem. If you read this book, you will know how tragic a war is."
3,The Review,This book was intend for a much younger audience. It moved in aslow pace and then would race up not in a steady pace.Also this bookwas very predictable.Only in a few spots was I surprised.The vocabulary was childish only providing us with a few new words.In the top hundred it would rank around the middle because it wasn't that great but it wasn't that bad either.
5,It's all because my english teacher made me.,"The story of the clay marble is about a little girl and her family trying to get away from armys that are killing all of the cambodian people. The're are other familys that are also trying to excape from the horror. The protagonist in the story is the cambodian people, and the antagonist is the army. Dara is the name of the little girl and she would be considdereda static because she stays the same through out the entire story, but her best friend would be Dynamic cause she changes alot."
1,The Clay Marble,"I didn't really like this book. I kept on waiting for something to happen, but nothing exciting ever really happened in this book. I wouldn't recommed this book to anybody. This book is a waste of tree and is just plain horrible."
2,The Clay Marble,"I realy didn't like the book because that it was about a girl and her believe in the marble. Another reason why was because they didn't have alot of action. The last reason why was because she didn't have to look long before she found her mom and grandpa, Sarun, Nea, Jantu, and baby."
2,The Clay Marble,I think this book was'nt that good because it had no real action plus the whole book was about a clay marble thats suppose to have some kind of magic.I really did'nt like the book.
1,Characters are stereotyped,"Dara's mother is a typical housewifely widow, Dara seems toonly be a product of her circumstances and not an individual humanbeing with her own mindset (even her confrontation with Sarun was instigated by Jantu),Jantu and Duoic were obviously inserted into the story to be good examples, Nea is overly submissive to Sarun......"
3,Jantu's Death,"Jantu's death has a profound and ever-lasting effect on the life of Dara. As Dara and her family are ready to leave, Sarun protests it. Dara is powered by the life and memory of her friend Jantu. She finally persuades Sarun to come home and live a peaceful life with the rest of her family. Even though they are living on the brink of war they succeed in living in an ever-lasting peace. This peace is powered by the precious memories of Jantu."
3,The Clay Marble,"The book was very good, but it started out slow. Halfway through the book it finally reached it's climax, and kept going. It takes place in Cambodia and Thailand, during the 1970's. The Wietnam war was going on. The book is about a girl and her family trying to escape from the war for freedom. We would recomend this book for intense readers."
3,Generally more suited for younger readers but....,"The Clay Marble is indefinitely a book meant for younger readers. However, it makes quite a good read despite all of its shortcomings.The Clay Marble is set in an extremely grim setting, where the characters (Dara and her family) are caught in between a raging war in Cambodia. Despite the rather simple language and sketchy details, the book does bring out a very special message to readers that in a country torn apart by war, there is still hope, and with hope, anything is possible.The book might be generally aimed for younger readers, but I personally feel that both old and young readers will be able to identify the message behind this book, after all, that's what reading is all about isn't it?"
3,A Review of The Clay Marble,"I did like the book the *Clay Marble*. I liked the story because it had it's up's & downs to keep me reading (even though we were forced to read it). I liked how some of the characters in the story were dynamic, in how they changed. Also, how some of the characters were just static, in the way that they didn't change in the story, they allways stayed the same in the book. The author (mingfong Ho), Like to foreshadow what events would happen in the story. So, over all i really enjoyed the book the *Clay Marble*"
4,Thumbs Up to Minfong Ho!,"I seem to think that this book is very good,and it teaches a very good story...a girl who's family has been broken up and meets up with another family who is broken up also.While theyre brother and sister keep getting closer so they decide if they get married they can be one whole family yet once again!"
4,Fender Flairs,"Received these in two days as per Amazon's shipping policy. Installed them on my pick up and they look great. They were a little more difficult to install than I thought they might be. I have a set on my wrangler and they bolted right on no problem, these require some cutting but they tell you that upfront. Well worth the effort. I would have gave them five stars except I was short three bolts. Called Bushwacker and had an entire installation kit in two days, great service."
3,Not what I expected,"This album is little more than a collection of tracks by Yes members. There is some Yes music but it is not performed by Yes as a band, rather it is performed by each artists band. I'm not sure that any of the songs have all three artists performing at the same time. Round About is performed by Rick Wakeman and I'm not not sure who is singing but it doesn't sound like Jon Anderson. Magic love is sung by Jon but sounds like a Jon and Vangelis track. Going Going Gone sounds like a left over GTR track. The songs seem to be solo efforts and, as far as I can tell, some were never performed by Yes.It is an interesting album if you are simply trying to fill out your collection. Don't expect it to sound like Yes. But if you would like to hear how each of these artists sounds in a setting outside of Yes this is a nice collection. The overall recording quality and sound is good. The performances are on par with what you would expect from these musicians."
1,Original Member of Yes,"Or, more accurately, *originally* members of Yes. Unfortunately, it sounds like Anderson on drums, Howe on keyboards and Wakeman on vocals. I shudder to think that out there in a vault somewhere is the follow-up entitled ""Kaye Banks Bufford."" The vocalist on ""Its all over now, baby blue"" sounds like Anderson after a sex change operation, if that's imaginable. And, believe me, it shouldnt be.There is a great ""And You and I"" out there performed by Wakeman solo on the grand piano; there is a reason that Anderson was generally restricted to one solo composition per concert.The best summary for this 'only for the completist compolition': Even Homer nodded."
2,Come on...,"Some guy in a suit slapped this together. Anderson, of course, is an original member, but, great as he is, Steve Howe didn't come in until the 3rd album, ""The Yes Album"" (though you do see his pic on the cover of the 2rd album, ""Time And a Word"", even though he didn't play a note on that album), and Rick Wakeman didn't come onboard until the 4th (and argueably their greatestalbum), ""Fragile"".I can (almost) see why the editor of this title yielded to the inaccuracy, but...Come on...in music (particularly, YES music), truth is everything (or should be)."
1,Piece of Junk,"This DVD player worked for about 5 months then it read ""no disc"" and would not play. Technical support unhelpful, warranty only 90 days. Tried to save some money going with this product - you get what you pay for. I would recommend spending more and getting something with better quality."
5,Good all around,"Good price, comes with everything you need and then more. Very impressive for the price!"
1,Bad Bad Bad,I had this product less than a week when it failed to play any DVDs.the tv is ok. But over all not worth it.
3,Good DVD Bad TV,The TV signal is poor; it seems like the ant does not work it is difficult to capture the channels signal
4,"Great product,,, Tv not good","The product is pretty well, it desing is well, and it have dolby processor with digital out.The Tv isn't very good with broadcast signal, all is ok with cable tv."
3,"Coby TF-DVD180 7""",There was no AC power cord. I have to charge the player in the car and only play it for the battery allotted time inside...THAT IS NOT FUN....The Tv tuner on the plyer has a hard time staying connected to the stations and it has a lot of static...The DVD player works fine...
3,its not working anymore,i thought it was a bargain for the price but the dvd without almost any use stops working!!!you better be carefull with this product
4,*** Excelent ***,"IT was the perfect gift for my boy, he always use it everywhere. But he just broke the tv ant, but the rest its coolllll"
4,Object to this unnecessary requirement,It worked. what else is there to say? Why can't I just say it was a good deal and stop all this nonsense
5,Cheap and gets the job done.,"If you are looking at this item, you probably already know what you are doing.So to make things simple here are few things you might also want to know:These seats are the same as the ""Danco 30017S #18 Bibb Seats.""In comparison to those seats the lip of the seat (the part which meets the rubber washer) is not rounded like the danco seats. Instead it is somewhat square-ish. Initially this put me off, however, after using a number of these seats it doesn't seem to be an issue.Otherwise, the only other remark to make is that because of the way these things are packaged (a whole bunch loosely packed in the container), the seats are marked and dented from bouncing off each other. But this has not seemed to impact their performance.With that said, buying a 25 pack of these is considerably cheaper than buying several two packs of the Danco alternative.They work; can't complain."
1,This is not Tango. Look ANYWHERE else...,"Tango is a very different kind of thing.Unfortunately, as other genres of serious music as well,nowadays is suffering the attack of people that have an insistant passionfor altering and sistematically destroying the essence of the real thing.This so unfortunate record, is a potpourri of old good tunesand a lot of untalented mechanicaly generated rythms.Tango is about passion, pain, love and life.This is about shaking a little bit of everything and making money.By the way the photo cover is pathetic.I'm sorry. Good new tango records are very rare.This one is not contributing at all.This is really garbage.Not even good for an elevator.Hopefully there will some day be zero stars to categorize this."
4,THE BEST ONE FOR A STARTER,"If you are about to begin experiencing tango. This is your record.A mix of electro and accoustic.The perfomances of Hi Perspective included here are better than the ones on ""Piazzola Remixed"".And please notice that the man whos ""sings"" Caminito is Marcello Mastroiani, the late italian actor."
3,Good designs but poor presentation.,"If you like Celtic knotwork and fanciful medieval animals this pattern book is for you. However, the patterns and black, dark, small and hard to read. On the plus side, the animal renderings are really good. I find it necessary to make enlarged copies of the patterns and then color in some of the smaller areas. Al in all, worthwhile."
4,A worth while purchase,"This book has many different designs available. The designs can be a bit small, and a bit difficult to read. I highly recommend taking these charts and enlarging them before starting work on them. There are a great variety in designs, some will take a while to complete, while others can be completed in much less time."
2,Mixed Reviews,"I like the designs, but the total black and white with tiny blocks makes the patterns hard to read. The designs are good, but lacking in color, so if you feel like playing around with them a bit, this is a great book - especially considering the price. Otherwise, I'd probably recommend staying away from it and going with a more expensive, though much more readable and more colorful alternative."
4,Advanced embroidery,"This book is for those that understand stitchery with ease. The designs are really good to use with anything, even making bookmarks. This book is for the advanced cross stitcher, or embroiderer."
5,Great book; great price,"WOW! For the price this book is absolutely wonderful. All the patterns are in black & white, but it's still just as useful as most of the $...-$... celtic cross-stitch books."
3,Adequate,"I bought this to replace a 400e that we had for years... thought it would be close enough in operation and quality but not exactly. The cutting is harsh in sound and feel for more than a few sheets and you have to be extremely careful and accurate when inserting the sheets to be cut so they aren't cut crooked. Not as smooth as the 400e. If you do binding in a hurry, definitely upgrade."
5,Fall in love with the characters in this book,"This book has stayed with me in a way few books ever have. The characters and their lives are fascinating in this page turner. The story follows the people of a small fishing village in Scotland through the eyes of the main character, where superstition guides the decisions of the fishermen. The plot has some delightfully inventive and humorous surprises and it left me feeling wistful. Ms. Lyon's lyrical style of writing kept me reading through til the end. I couldn't put it down."
2,well no closed captioned and subtitle!,"I am hearing impaired. my friend recommend me its good show tv so I rental them by Netflix no closed captioned or subtitle. I miss that season 1,2 and 3. I will watch show tv channel oxygen new season 4 every tue with closed captioned. thank you."
2,Pathetic,"I am a huge fan of Tori's. However, I have to admit this is a bad DVD. It shows how pathetic her life has become: she struggles for a life and have no CLUE about being an entrepreneur. I bought the DVD because I wanted to see her life change and get a glimpse of her new B&B, planning to visit it myself one day. I just gave up. The place is awful to say the least. The decoration is a fiasco. She seems to be the dumbest. It really changed the whole image I had of her."
5,Cafe Quijano Que Grande es Esto del amor,I discovered this group on Pandora Radio and I love everything they record! Their sound is unique with a combination of modern rock and pop with more traditional Spanish sounds. I can listen to their CD over and over. It's too bad they have split.
1,Dr. Worman Is a Liar,"Dr. Worman should be ashamed of himself. He is obviously in the pockets of the big drug companies, because there are several herbal remedies that truly enhance liver function. One of these herbs, milk thistle, has been proven to aid liver function, but Dr. Worman goes out of his way to claim that no ""scientific"" studies show this. That's nonsense, and it's a lie. Milk thistle has been known to aid liver function for centuries, and it has been thorougly tested and proven to do so in recent studies. Dr. Worman does not want you to know this, because the drug companies cannot make any money on this common and inexpensive herb. So Dr. Worman would rather lie and potentially let people die while he shills for ""Big Pharm."""
2,"Fun, but quality lacks.","We bought a container of REAL Tinker Toys at an auction this summer. I loved them as a kid and my twin four-year-olds loved them too.We wanted more and decided to try IDEAL's Fiddlestix. Honestly, we were thrilled at first... at least for the first three days. We did not abuse, misuse, or manhandle our Fiddlestix. Breakage, splitting, and color loss occurred very soon after use. I've written to Poof-Slinky Inc. and included pieces from our set that broke under normal wear. I am awaiting a response. We would not buy these again unless there's a redesign. Redesigning them is not that hard to do. They need to use a harder wood for the sticks and make shorter cuts in the ends of the sticks."
3,Not what I was expecting!,I thought these were the exact same thing as Tinker Toys but they are not so I am a bit disappointed because Tinker Toys you can do alot more with then these. They are still fun and my daughter has a blast building with them but not even close to Tinker Toy territory in what you can build.
1,Hated this item,Did not like this product at all. I threw it away the first day I got it. It was horriable
5,Glo E Bear,"This is a Great Glo E Bear and High Quality, it was suppose to have been a 16"" but seller made a honest mistake it was only a 12"" but well worth the money I paid for it, it was a used Glo E Bear but in Excellent Condition, my grand kids love it, Top of the Line Seller, Thanks you very much for the Great Deal........"
2,Glow E Bear,"Awww...he's so darn cute. How can you not love him?My kids love the glowing bear especially before bed. The bear will glow on it's own for 15 minutes & then turn itself off, so it's great for a smaller child who likes the light before sleeping. Not too bright to irritate eyes. Just glows perfectly.I don't know why the stars say I only gave it a 2! Glitch on the site or something, but I truly think the product is a 4 :)"
5,Love this glow-in-the-dark cuddly bear!,My two girls (age 7 and 9) absolutely love these bears! They cuddle with them at night and want to make every room dark so they can play with them during the day! They are the hit at all their sleepovers and their friends ask where they got them! Looking for a great gift for a child you think has everything? Look no further...this is it!
4,Our 3 year old loves it.,Our 3 year old loves this bear. She carries it around and it reassures her at night. It's so bright that she can carry it when the power goes out and gives off a reassuring sphere of light around her. I didn't give it a 5 stars because it's battery pack in the back is kind of hard. It would have gotten 5 stars if they had done a better job cushioning this apparatus.
5,Buy One for All Your Kids at Once,"At bed time this is the most coveted Christmas gift in our house. I bought one for my 3-YO daughter who absolutely loves it but should have also purchased another for my 6YO son ... and my mom.If you are faced with a choice with a big price difference between just the bear or purchasing the entire package which includes a wand and book I'd skip on the whole package if I had to do it again. We're big readers in our house and the book is really not worth much extra, plus the wand is just another thing to get lost in the shuffle - doesn't really add much.It's pretty and relaxing regardless of your age. My only concern is that the starter batteries did not even last a week. The toy does have an automatic shut off to conserve power and I'm hoping that the only reason I've had to replace the batteries so quickly is because they were just starter batteries. Battery hogs are no fun. Thinking positive I'll still give it a 5 because it's a winner in all other ways."
4,"ehhh... nice, but not what I expected","I like the bear, it's very bright and colorful. I just thought it would do a little more than what it does. It's really cute, very soft and nice looking. My daughter likes it, but because it doesn't do anything but light up she gets bored after a few minutes."
4,He took up the runes,"It`s a very difficult and ungrateful job to choose the best of Garbarek`s works. This one deserves four stars, to my opinion, ""Twelve moons"" sounds fresher and more diverse."
5,What to say?,"Again, what to say? This is my absolutely preferred CD, my top one, the one i love more and more. Somebody says this is not best Garbarek around, somebody says this is not best jazz or world music or whatever. For me it's just excellence, a complete travel in music developing through the entire disc and especially Molde Canticle. Take the time to hear at Part 3, once and once more, and you'll feel it."
2,"If you love symbolic logic, you'll love this book","I bought this book hoping to get ammunition to use in arguments with theists. I found the book to be useless for that purpose: the arguments are too abstruse for general use. If you are a professional philosopher well versed in symbolic logic, this will be just the book for you. For lay people, though, it is tough sledding and, in the end, not very interesting."
5,Excellent Pan!,"I love this little pan ... perfect for making omelettes. I purchased this to replace my old teflon non-stick pan. All you need to do is spray some oil before cooking and it doesn't stick at all. I don't know what other people are doing, but my eggs slide right out of the pan and cleanup is a cinch."
1,Difficult to Clean,"I bought this pan and it has been very hard to clean. My husband cooks over-easy eggs in it and finally, I just had to throw it away. It takes 15 minutes of labor to get it clean, even if you soak it within seconds of cooking. Ugh. There has to be a better pan out there. Be wary. I have never had this experience with a pan before so I am pretty sure it will affect all of this same type pan."
3,All Clad,"It's everything they claim it would be. However, I prefer a non-stick surface. I would probably buy a Calphalon pot in the future."
1,Terrible cookware...save your money,"The best thing I ever did was buy this pan. Because it was a cheap lesson to learn and I returned my larger set before opening the box. This is terrible cookware. I have this pan and the wok and tried cooking on it for nearly a year but am now so frustrated that I'm giving it up. I understand how to cook on stainless but still, who needs this aggravation of burning food and not being able to clean the pans!!!! You can not cook an egg on this pan, it's a kitchen disaster! Save your money, test with this pan first!"
5,Great speakers for travel or beach...small in size and amazing sound!!!,Just received these speakers a few weeks ago. Have been using it quite a bit at home but really bought for travel and beach purpose. Sound is great for such a small speaker - and great size. I highly recommend! Purchased them on Amazon for around $54.
5,Very good equipment!!,These regulators are exceptionally good equipment. Hobart has been a longtime leader in welding supplies and have always produced exceptional equipment at a very competitive price!! I find it very easy to obtain equipment through Amazon. Cingratulations on a very professional site!!
1,I hope i havnt bought it,"If you already watched Laura Stamm's or Robbby Glantz's DVD, no need to consider about this......."
2,bitter,"I purchased these to help stay awake during long hours of studying and they do give me a little pick up, but they are quite bitter. If you don't mind bitter flavors then go for it."
5,Exactly as advertised,"I've been working with a heavy bag for more than fifteen years, but this is my first bag with a water core. The other reviews speaking to this type of bag having a more realistic feel are on point. I also really like that the resistance/firmness of the bag is the same all over the bag. I recently bought a bag that was way too hard at at the bottom half and way too soft at the top. This bag does not have that problem. Should I ever need another bag, I'll go with this brand."
5,Excellent. I have owned two.,"This is my second hydrocore bag that I've owned. For a couple years I attempted to pummel and destroy it, but it failed to yield. Sadly, I gave it away during a move. Finally I have another one and the workmanship seems solid. Unless you are Chuck Norris or Captain America, this bag should last. Besides, the water is good emergency storage, add a little bleach."
5,Hoping for more,"Loved season 1 of the DVD of ""Single Handed."" I was so disappointed to find out there isn't the possibility, at least at this point, to obtain more in this series. Keep looking and hoping. Series was well written dramatic with a good blend of wit and intensity. Getting the next in this series is a definite plan!"
5,Interesting series,Thought it was well acted with an interesting plot. This DVD has been shared with many others and they really enjoyed
3,Irish Policeman,"We liked this movie; it is about an Irish cop in small town Ireland determined to do ""the right thing"" instead of caving into the politics. Yep there are bad guys trying to cover up for their friends. It is low key and different from ""A Touch of Frost"" and ""Midsomer Murders"" but still enjoyable. To make this movie better it has CLOSED CAPTION."
5,Ravishing Scenery,Beautiful to see Connemara's wild beauty. The principle of affective hazard was well proposed: the startling richness of the landscape vs. the equally disturbing corruption. Well Done!!We would love to see more.TWM
3,Authentic countryside cop's life lacks thrills,Set almost entirely in a quiet village with simmilar action. Son of retired and crooked village police captain takes over his Da'd job and has to deal with dad and da's old pals. Sleepy plot builds with each episode as you get to know secrets.
5,Great Mystery,This is one of the best mysteries. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. British do the best series.
4,Good basic,"I always find the Let's Go guides very easy to use and loaded with information, and this was no exception. They are very thorough; you'd be hard put to have a place in mind that is not touched on in some fashion. (Compared to Rick Steves, for example, whose books are limited generally to his favorite places in a country) My only complaint is their slant toward partying college types, so there is overabundant information on those particular activities and places."
2,"Chinese Laundry Women's Repeat Platform Sandal, Size 10","The shoe looks great, but the size is too small for a 10. I wear a 10 and this shoe fits like a 9 or 9 1/2. This is unfortunate because they are really pretty shoes. I recommend ordering a whole size larger than your normal size with Chinese Laundry. They fit small."
3,Anticlimactic finale.,"I felt the same way about the book as Kieran Fox, and felt her review the most spot-on regarding the final third of the book in how it is indeed exactly a materialistic pseudo-dualism. Mind is not [material, i.e. the brain], but the mind is not immaterial either. Read Kieran's review for more. The first 70% of the book however was fascinating and I recommend that part of it."
3,Not as interesting as I thought,"I thought it was too clinical, I prefer books on the mind more in the line of ""The Man Who Tasted Shapes"", which is written more as a story than a clinical book. Did offer good insight into the way the mind works. Especially fascinating was the research on the front temporal lobes. - Kristy Welsh, author of ""Good Credit is Sexy"""
5,"Great, Fun, Outrageous Read!","This is a great, fast-paced read about vampires and werewolves and Roman gods--all living in the 21st Century. Jason Fury does a fabulous job of creating a gallery of bigger-than-life characters, especially the fabulous Johnny America, the lust object of the supernatural world. Christina Tremont is queen of the supernatural world in Manhattan. Together, they're dynamite as they fight the evil Dark Ones, a sect of monstrous vampires. Couldn't put this one down!"
1,Tedious,"There was about a 100 page book buried in the 382 pages the author took to finish it.There was nothing even remotely erotic or humorous about the repetitive, redundant desciptions of the genitalia of the masculine characters that appeared about every third page . So BORING ,if it were a movie I would have walked out."
4,Satchmo's second career,"The songs on LOUIS ARMSTRONG * THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION generally follow a regression from 1968 to 1938. The album's liner notes conversely provide details of Armstrong's most influential years: the mid-Twenties until his lip broke, while touring Europe in the early 1930s. The writer glows about Satchmo's influence on ALL subsequent musicians and vocalists, from Benny Goodman to the Rolling Stones! Truly a hyperbolic overview.But the music is what matters most. Armstrong adapted to the realities of losing his superhuman playing abilities by developing a more expressive style, and by concentrating on vocalization. This album documents well that second phase of his performing career. Source material is drawn from all major labels: DECCA, COLUMBIA, VICTOR, ABC-PARAMOUNT, KAPP and VERVE. Transfer quality is excellent. This collection is particularly recommended for newcomers to the music of Louis Armstrong.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 75:39"
2,Pop star Satchmo,"Naturally, if you are one of the vast numbers of Satchmo's pop followers, you'll find everything you need on this volume (""What a Wonderful World"", ""Cabaret"", ""Hello Dolly"", ""Blueberry Hill""...), but if you're more of a jazz fan and you buy this album, well...As old Pops would put it - someday you'll be sorry...Strictly for jazz beginners and pop fans; there's nothing definitive or essential abotu this album, although this is far from being bad music..."
4,A Good Collection,"Although jazz isn't my go-to genre of music, I definitely enjoy it from time to time, being serenaded by relaxing vocals and instrumentals. Louis Armstrong is definitely one of my favorites, not just due to his unique voice, but the carefree demeanor with which he sings, expressing an unbridled joy that permeates through my being. While I am more a fan of his collaborations with Ella Fitzgerald, I find this collection of hits very satisfying as a casual jazz listener."
4,An Excellent Second Best,"I was looking for another Louis Armstrong cd and tried this one. Although it wasn't the one I sought, I think this was an excellent second best. Well pleased."
3,OK,Does not look much like a fluer de lis design. Has four seams down the lenth of the glass like they were put together from four parts. The only good thing is I did't pay regular price for them.
2,Cheap Looking,"After all the other stuff I've ordered from Amazon, I think these are the cheesiest. They are cheaply made. I would not recommend these."
1,Poor quality,The seams didn't bother me nearly as much as the rough rims and uneven thickness. I thought that people might cut themselves if they used them. I didn't bother to return - just tossed them in the trash.
2,NOT SO GREAT GLASSES,i really thought these gobblets where going to be of better quality then they where! save your money..
3,"OK, but not great","This book is interesting, but not engrossing. The idea of using contemporary news stories as the way of telling about the various hauntings would be better if the stories were better written. Also, many of the stories describe an apparition, but make no attempt to tell who it is or why it is there. Ghost stories without background all sound the same, and are very dull."
3,Wonderfully comprehensive book,"Generally this book was a good read. It had stories (as the title shows) from around the country. My only gripe with this book is that it tends to ramble quite a bit and you lose the sense of the ""true"" story. They even included some of the old favorites that you told around the campfire when you were young!"
3,Great but...,"Not a bad collection of ghost stories. Some of them were really scary, but the author is a real Debbie Downer."
2,good but...,"I want to like these bars, but there is so much sugar in them I just can't reorder them."
5,Perfect,"I have a bar every day for breakfast (as I need something but am not a breakfast person). They are delicious, satisfying, and healthy. Also, they have few calories."
3,So so...,"These are fairly sweet, but not bad.The pictures are misleading, it shows thin crust and thick filling, its excactly the opposite, very thin filling and thick crust, its not bad but i think I will look elsewhere for a breakfast bar."
1,Disturbing...,"Perhaps it is because, at 22, I am still close enough to the generation gap that I have heard these songs, which appear unedited on these CDs, or perhaps it is because I am one of those few adults who listen to the lyrics of a song rather than just the chorus, but I am greatly disturbed that any corporation would stoop to the level of putting pop songs most certainly intended for adult audiences (given that they deal with such subjects as casual sex, infidelity, and the alteration of one's body/personality to fit the expectations of another, to name just a few) on a CD inteded for impressionable children. I reccomend to any parent who would look to buying this CD to look up the lyrics to songs like Dilemma, Hey, Baby, or Whenever, Wherever before buying this ... CD, as I assure you that your children will learn and absorb these lyrics. I speak from personal experience as my 6-year-old godson came home singing these songs after a birthday party a couple of weeks ago."
1,What...,"Why are little kids singing ""I tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt' even matter?""Why are kids singing sexually suggestive songs.What in the world is happening here..."
1,...,"This is an idiotic c-d! The kids who sing this are WAY TOO absessed-with-the-songs 4th and 3rd graders! I don't mean to insult anyone, but this album ""is bad!"" Get songs sung by the original artists if you like the songs on here"
5,Best yet in the series...,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Dead Hot Mama"" and the entire series. The characters continue to grow and evolve, the plotting is tight and twisted. Being from Wisconsin, I especially enjoy the Northwoods backdrop and localisms. Don't let the fishing theme scare you off from reading this series. I fished every summer with my Grandpa and all I ever caught was a cold, but I still LOVE this series and can't wait for the next installment!!!"
5,Murder on Ice,"Doc Osborne, a retired dentist, is swept up in a series of murder investigations. He is helping the town's police chief, Lew Ferris and also hoping she will think of him as more than a fishing pal. The bodies of two snowmobilers and a body of a beautiful exotic dancer are uncovered and the mystery begins. The supporting characters are eccentric, the setting (northern Wisconsin in winter) adds spice. I'm looking forward to reading others in the Loon Lake Fishing Mystery series. If you enjoy fishing (fly or ice) this book will be for you but even if you don't like fishing, the references to the sport will not turn you off."
4,fishing in snow country,"This story takes place in Northern Wisconsin, where I grew up. It is very authentic, complete with references to ice-fishing, which I have done. For me, this book was nostalgic, and I enjoyed it very much, but even if you didn't grow up in Northern Wisconsin it is an interesting story, well told. Red it. you'll enjoy it."
2,Dog Pet Bed,I was very disappointed when I went to wash the cover of the bed. It is attached inside therefore unless I take the time to take out the stitching I can't wash the cover. I certainly will not buy another one of these again.
5,grinder,read about it in magazine and had used one before liked it now this new one is even better would recommend it.
4,Ultimate X-Men: Great Stuff!,"After countless attempts at creating a new universe, or continuum, the folks at Marvel finally hit on the right approach: recast their franchise characters as younger and more in tune with the issues of the day. Add top-notch writers and artists and voila! we have a hit. Though the story arcs are so far quite familiar to those with any sense of Marvel's history, the fresh approach to characters and the nifty art contribute to an overall great reading experience.I would recommend this compilation to anyone who can't get enough of the Marvel universe or those who would like to start their trip into said universe. In short, recommended for any Marvel fan!"
2,Why not just read the original?,"I loved Bacheolo's art in this book. Really good stuff. Again Millar's poor writing of villains shows. Proteus just didn't have an ""umph"" behind him. Though he did get in his required body count (is it just me or do villains now aday have to kill like 300+ people an issue? Is it like a requirement to get their villain's license?). I will give Millar points for having Proteus being Xavier's son.Still, over all, I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was Tomorrow People or even Return to Weapon-X. I think Millar is running out of steam. If you want a good telling of the Proteus Saga go pick up the original Claremont/Byrne one, it's worth it."
2,Compiles issues #13-#20,"I was glad that I borrowed this from the library instead of buying it. The first two issues are a weak solo Gambit story. Little happens in Issue 15 besides a Professor X faux-Newsweek article and a revelation about Magneto. The book improves with Issue 16's reframing of the Proteus story called ""World Tour"". Charles and Moira's son David has escaped from a facility in Scotland, but luckily the X-Men are in Europe for a book promotional tour! Colossus disappears so Cyclops and Jean search for him in Russia. Betsy Braddock appears in #17 and #18 and #19 continue the Proteus story. Issue 20 marks time as the only point of interest is a conversation between Professor X and Magneto. The author annoyingly overuses modern technology like cell phones and instant messaging in an effort to make the characters seem hip. The last few issues are decent, but the poor first half and the high price merit a two star rating."
5,new x-men #13-18,Millar keeps up the high quality of storytelling he has shown us so far. I really don't know what else to say that hasn't been said already.
1,yo,"don't buy. Bad ball. Bad bounce. Broke window. Mom comin in to room. Pullin my ear. ""Get off and stop typin everything I say"". Gotta go. Bad buy."
4,Project Management Step-By-Step,This book was easy to read and follow with good examples. I have read similar books and this one is better than most. I would recommend this book to the beginner as well as the experienced project manager.
2,just couldn't get into it.,Will try at a later date... but I just could not get myself into the book... hard read.
5,Good Purchase,"Very tight fit for even for a skinny pencil condensor. definitely not for dynamics. you'll have to get the dynamic version.i use it with a shure pg81. it's very tight, but it fits.it works great. reduces handling noise and vibrations from the floor."
2,Case is sturdy,"I had originally wrote that this case was sturdy and wouldn't fall apart. I was wrong the plastic latches constantly fell off and now I lost 2 of them. So its basically useless and I wouldn't recommend anyone buying this case. The thing is huge, it wouldn't even fit in the trunk of my car."
2,Not a value,"This case appeared to be well made and substantial, however it is anythnig but. I am using it for a SoCom 16 and an 870 shotgun. The case is stressed with these two guns. The plastic snap over latches are the biggest disappointment."
1,POS,"I ORDERED ONE AND GOT IT, IT WAS BUSTED SENT IT BACK GOT ANOTHER ONE, IT WAS MISSING ALL OF THE CRITICAL PARTS, SENT IT BACK, DECIDED TO CUT MY LOSSES AND CANCELLED THE ORDER I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT I WOULD GET THE 3RD TIME...LOL"
3,Almost but not quite,"I purchased this case to cary my AR-30 338 Lapua Magnum outfitted with a Millet 6X25-56mm scope. Needless to say, I needed a pretty big case. The inside dimensions of this case would have worked except for the fact that the 3 plastic dividers, located in the middle of the case, would not allow my rifle to fit with a scope of that size. Other than that the case seemed worth the $80. Well off to see the $200 cases now."
2,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed with the quality of this product. On a flight from California to Mississippi someone attempted to steal a rifle and a shotgun. They tore off all the latches, and pried open the end of the case. Because of the straps holding the firearms in place, they were unable to remove them. They probably would have probably been successful if they had more time. The locks on each side of the handle are not adequate. There should also be locks at both ends of the case. The latches are worthless. I would not recommend this product."
5,Great double rifle case!,"This case is great! It is large make no mistake about that! The price is very cheap for it's size and the shipping was FAST AND Free! I currently fit my tactical carbine, tactical shotgun, both with sights, and my pistol in this case with no problem, it can even hold a few small accessories! I am working on fitting my sub machine gun in there with this combo. I also use this case for my 300 Win mag rifle and my .22 rile, both with scopes, and my pistol. My only design wish would be that the indents or holes in the center of the case not go all the way through, this makes the large case into section instead o a nice open design. Lastly with thick foam and straps, almost every gun fits snug and secure! Great case!"
5,Plano Pro Max Double Rifle Case: A Sweet Deal!,"For the price, I don't know of a better storage medium for a couple of scoped rifles. I have a mosin nagant (scoped) in mine, and an AK with a dogleg rail and sight , with plenty of room to spare for accessories. Mine arrived in pristine condition, without any missing parts. Yes, it is bulky and heavy, and I will not be taking it to the range with me. But for reasonably secure storage at home, without room for a safe, this is a really good buy when a couple of padlocks are added to it. No, it is not a safe, and should not be treated like one, but it can stand a little punishment, and is far easier to conceal than a safe. A great product, for the right price."
4,Great Case,"I recently purchased this case to carry my AR and shotgun. It's working out very well so far, took it on a weekend trip and had no problems. The case is very spacious fits those two guns just fine with room for mags, etc. The pillar design is a going to be a must for me from now on makes moving and handling a large case like this nice and easy, without having to worry about it's vulnerabitity."
4,Perfect for storage,"I have vintage firearms and used four of these to store them. Outstanding value and quality for the price, would recommend for everyone except those that will travel a lot with them. I think there are better for traveling sportsmen but if your storing firearms, this is a top quality product for the money."
1,Cheapness,You will get what you pay for. This case does not close tight and wiggles a lot. Avoid it. I am keeping it because it's too much hassle to return it.
1,Very Poor Quality,"Purchased this to use during a move. Used it literally twice (two domestic round trips on a major airline). While there is no external damage to the case two of the four retaining bars (??) that the internal straps fit through have snapped. Also, one of the buckles broke, Very cheap plastic and a poor design. Would upload pics if Amazon provided that capability."
3,Plano was plain!,"Description of product lead me to believe the case was actually lockable. (to me that means lockable with a key)"" Latched"" to hold the case closed does not qualify as ""locked""."
4,Very Pleased!,Case was what I hoped for except for minor assembly of strap holding bracket.Other then that I was very pleased with item.
2,Verbose and lacking examples,"Although this book includes decent descriptions of the material presented, there are no examples with numbers or problems worked out. Therefore, it does not make it easy to apply the concepts to actual scenarios. If you are expecting traditional ""textbook"" style, you will not get it with the book."
3,An older book for engineers,"This is an older book which is actually a collection of chapters by the five authors with no correlation or cohesion between them. It is really for engineers and abounds with scaling arguments. Not an easy book to read and limited value as a reference volume. It was written in 1979 and reviewing it in 2012, one is very aware of its age. Since then several good books on coastal and estuarine waters have appeared and I would recommend one of them by searching Amazon for coastal models or estuarine dispersion."
2,Eh.,"Not bad, but nothing to rave about. I found Alfred's character more sympathetic than Virginia's, although nobody in the novel felt like a fleshed-out, intelligent adult. This seemed like the next step up from Judy Blume. I thought that large parts of it were contrived so that the author could include ""juicy"", voyeuristic interludes (in an effort to break the stereotype of Quakers as dowdy prudes, perhaps?). Once again, I don't know why so few modern writers seem to be able to convey character and meaning obliquely instead of just blurting it all out to their readers."
2,Does not work with samsung phones either,"I bought this card for my Samsung T809 and it did not work. I called Samsung and Kingston and both told me that the other needed to ""create a software update on their products"". So now I use it for my Casio camera. It's a little slow at loading (I think it's because I have to use the included SD adapter) but it's okay. I suggest SanDisk and Dana-Elec brands, which I've had good experiences with."
1,Incomplete,I expected more Rashi commentary than this on each Parasha and am not getting the information I hoped for. It is not helpful.
2,Just didn't like it,"For the cost I was expecting a thicker heavier duty type of liner. Right now I have all weather floor mats covering the back, this seemed like a poor substitute. I'm sure this product is very durable, I just had a different expectation. Also, the edge nearest the door has a lip on it. Personally I didn't like this design and considered cutting it off thinking I would snag it on anything I was loading in the back. Decided for the price I shouldn't need to cut anything off. I do really like the hole for the seat belt attachments, that is plus but not enough to keep it."
4,Terrific book....but,"This is a terrific book providing essential mathematical foundations that most econ textbooks don't seem to provide any more. A clearly useful item for your reference shelves if you plan to be a real game theorist (and not a poser).This used to be available as a relatively cheap paperback, but Dover seems to have gotten wise over the textbook market and started selling much fancier looking, but far more expensive ""phoenix editions."" The sudden jump in cost is the primary reason why this edition gets only four stars."
3,"The Videos Are Great, But...","Weird Al is a genius and his videos are highly entertaining; however, the picture quality of this DVD is a real let-down and the blame can be placed on Image Entertainment. I own many DVDs including about six made by Image and one thing I, along with many others, have concluded is that Image just can't make DVDs. Hopefully someday a company that knows how to make DVDs will buy out Image and re-release all of Image's titles in an improved quality."
4,"IT'S ALL ABOUT THE VIDEOS, BABY!","This is a great disk. Weird Al is the best of the best when it comes to satire. Hard core and passing fans alike will get their monies worth with this collection, buy it right now! But.. The DVD leaves something to be desired. I was very disappointed that it contained none of the great supplemental material that makes DVD's such an outstanding format. The menu is minimal, and navigation is poor. This could have been the quintessential format for that brand of Weird Al wackiness we all love. The disk could and should have given us some of these things: Hidden jokes; song lyrics; insight; Easter eggs; fun menu navigation, and general Weird Al-ness. At least it's not a complete video library, so hopefully these shortcomings can be accounted for on the next video release. Still it's a great disk, can't wait for more."
5,I just keep laughing!,"I knew he was talented and funny, but seeing him on my television anytime I want is the best! All 21 of his videos are there on the DVD. Anytime you need a good laugh, just pop it in and get ready to smile!"
2,"Al goes best, but DVD goes worst","Al is the best, no doubt about it. Music Videos are so funny and the lyrics are cool. But, the DVD itself is very poor. I don't know why it isn't VHS but DVD, because its quality is so poor, there's no feature something only for DVD. Screens are *very* noisy and ugly. No subtitles, No lyrics, No supplement at all. If you don't know about Al, you will be embarrassed for absencing of any information about Al, even a simple profile or something. (But the Music Videos will makes you Al's fan, I do bet.)If you are Al's fan, this one is a essential one, but its quality can disappoint you, possibly. So don't expect too much before you get this!"
5,Some people are never happy...,First thing is first. Al is a god. This DVD is pretty great. It's a shame that it's getting a bad name because people are whining about it not being on VHS. And you guys call yourselves fans. Where were you when the first collection came out on VHS? Or when the Alapalooza and Bad Hair Day videos came out. You should already have these videos. And you should be watching them non stop rather than complaining because you don't have them all nice and neat on one collection. Be happy with what ya got and be satisfied by the fact that Al will make more. Never fear.
4,Bought this for my son!,I bought this for my son last Christmas. He & His friends have watched this over & over! It was well worth the purchase.
1,False Advertising,Well I would probably have a review for this but when I ordered this video I got a delay notice then a notice that they had cancelled my order because they don't have the video. Hmmmmmm. Seems like false advertising to me. So don't waste your time trying to buy this. They don't have it.
5,DVD????,"GUESS WHO MATT HERE AGAIN I DO NAT HAVE IT I AM SURE IT IS GREAT BUT WHY DID THEY MAKE IT DVD. I BARELY HAVE A VCR I AM NOT RICH I MEAN I LIVE IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH 27 OTHER PEOPLE AND I HAD TO SELL MY INTERNAL ORGANS JUST TO PAY THE RENTI TAKE BATHES IN MY NEIBORS SUBTIC TANK FOR GOD SAKE YOU DONT BELIVE ME MY DAD WIPS ME UNTIL QUARTER AFTER 12 AND THEN HE WOULD GET TO TIRD AND MAKE ME WIP MY SELF AND THEN HE CHOPPED ME INTO PIECES AND PLAYS FRISBEE WITH MY BRAIN AND I NEVER CONPLAIN, SO WHY DID THEY MAKE IT DVD FOR US PEOPLE WHO CANT AFFORD CLOTHES ORA DVD PLAYER I AM SURE IT IS FUNNY BUT HECK MAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR US SLAVES WHO EAT DERTA WEK A GO I GOT HUKED ON FONIX IT RELY WOKSSEE YOU LATER ALLAGATER MATT"
3,a long walk up the water slide,not as good as some of the other books by Don Winslow yet still interesting and appeline great fun breezy read. i recomend checking out some of the other books such as While Drowning in the desert (Neal Carey Mystery)
3,Worth Reading,"After reading Hunter's Bride, Joseph's Bride was a little disappointing. Jessica Wulf's writing remains fabulous, but Joseph doesn't quite sweep me off my feet as Orion did. The story of Joseph and Annie Rose is wonderful -- beautifully written. But Joseph lacked the intensity of his brothers. Perhaps he wasn't ""Cheyenne"" enough for me. I have since read Grey Eagle's Bride, and, well, don't even get me started about Grey Eagle!! In any event, I do recommend reading all three books about the Beaudine Brothers. You will yearn to don a doeskin dress and search for a man with an eagle feather attached to his long black hair . . ."
3,OK reading but not as captive as Orion and Grey Eagle,"Jessica Wulf is a very talented writer and has written three books on the Beaudine Brothers. However, I must confess that Joseph's Bride just didn't quite do it for me. The two books, Grey Eagle's Bride and Hunter's Bride were truly wonderful reads. I guess Joseph wasn't my type. I still recommend reading all three books. It's a nice collection to have on your shelf."
4,Excellent Book,Just finished this book and of course it was great. Joseph Beaudine is so sweet and caring. I really liked the way he fell head over heels over Annie Rose. It was love at first sight. This book was very well written but it did not captivate me as much as Orion's Bride. This book is filled with romance and adventure and will keep you wanting more and more. I guess Joseph just isn't my type. No one came come close to Orion Beaudine in my opinion. I would like to recommend this book to everyone. This is a GREAT romance book.
5,WHAT A HUNK,"DO NOT miss this book in fact do not miss any of the three. Jessica has made each brother different but the same and a hard choice to pick.If you like westerns then you will not regret buying these and do not forget her last trilogy set which is a must. I would also like to know when her next trilogy is coming out, please let me know."
2,Not what I expected,"This was a quick read and still waste of my time. The book explains the progressive development of children's thought process and speach, based on Piaget's observations. If you want to read about latest scientific studies in child development and parenting tips from an experienced child psycologist, I recommend Your Child's Growing Mind by Jane Healy."
2,Mediocre,"I became familiar with the author through the same CBC radio interview that another reviewer cited. The synopsis of this book sounded interesting and I was in the mood for some light reading, so gave it try. Since I was reading on a Kindle I don't know what page I gave up on it. My thought was that life is too short to get stuck reading a mediocre book. I found the characters uninteresting and the writing flat. I realize it was translated, so perhaps some of the blame goes to the translator."
2,charger for ZEN,"It the Creative Zen MP3 player is plugged with the charger and play at the same time in the car, it gives out squeaky sound."
2,Car Charger,"My opinion is, you would be better of purchasing the ""Creative Zen"" charger, not this cheap knock off version. The only reason why I purchased it because I misplaced the real deal (while moving) that I purchased from Creative. I knew that this wasn't going to be as good as the original one I purchased, but I didn't expect it to me so cheap. People don't intentionally drop stuff, sometimes it just happens. I dropped this cheap imitation knock off and it cracked open. Hopefully, I will find the real one that I purchased from Creative, which by the way I dropped at least 3 times since I had it and not to my surprise, this particular still works. I just can't find it at the moment. :-<"
2,Now & Zen,I have no use for this device since Zen is out and never was in and Apple rules the world.
4,Good but for one thing...,"If you plan to charge your Zen product while playing music in your car via an FM device instead of a direct AUX cable connection, you will get a ton of static/interference. Otherwise, I loved how it worked."
5,replacement,"Replaced the original manufacturer's product with this one, which already has outlasted the original. Quick service."
4,"Cheap, but it works",This is my second one. Very good price and it works. Just be gentle with it or it will break.
5,. . . and the dog loves it too!!,"Many weeks after purchase, this ball's flexible finned surface is immune to Holly's teeth, unlike other 'pet play' balls in shops & specialist stores which are soon destroyed.Only gripe is that 2 out of the 5 ordered were black rather than brightly coloured and can be difficult to find after being thrown some distance into long grass etc.A friend who asked for 'any colour but black' received a mix of colours - plus black, which was not good PR bearing in mind how much postal costs to the UK add to the original USA pricePerhaps the black ones could be used during a hoped-for White Christmas . . ."
5,tanzanian ball,"made of rubber, it will be hard for Bruno to chew up. the only problem I have with it, is that I ordered a small and he can easily choke on it. I ended up ordering a medium one and it is perfect."
1,Super-Flush,"I have tried two other brands of timed release niacin, and neither made me flush. I took my first Source Naturals 250mg TR Niacin yesterday morning, without food. I began to flush after 45-60 minutes. I then ate breakfast, and the flushing went away.Today, I waited until breakfast to take this pill, with oatmeal. I flushed bright red and have been quite uncomfortable for half an hour - it's reduced, but not over. I'll be throwing these away.[My hope is to get my HDL number above 40. Tablets from Brooks did this (42, up from 34), but that store brand disappeared when Rite-Aid gobbled up Brooks. With Nature's Bounty 250mg TR capsules, my most recent number was 33. I also take a statin, so this is fine tuning.]"
2,Not what a console should sound like...,"I had a Crosley portable turntable that I was pretty happy with that was lost, and I decided to upgrade with this model hoping for a fuller sound. Unfortunately, this is pretty much the guts of the small turntable put into a console body, and due to the pressboard construction (which is terrible for sound amplification) as well as the fact that the only speakers you have are two poor quality 4 inch ones blaring out the sides (probably the same speakers that were in the small turntables) it just sounds way too trebly for what it is. This model completely misses the point of the console design. I recommend getting a small crosley turntable if buying new, because for it's size, it sounds relatively nice and full, unlike this dinky waste of space. Booo!"
4,Excellent Buy,"Radio arrived on schedule via UPS. It arrived undamaged and fits perfectly in our home. I will say that the internal speakers suck but with the 2 external speakers we hooked up, the Crosley is everything we expected. Well worth the price we paid for it."
3,CAREFUL,THE COMPANY SENT ME THE WRONG ITEM. I ORDER WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PIC BUT RECIVED A DIFFRANT ONE LUCKLY THE ONE THEY SENT WORKED BUT IT WAS A TILT MOUNT.AND IT WAS BLACK.
2,Dissapointed,It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Papi Chulo by Lorna was really the only excellent song.
1,"Dud, Big Dud","Wow, this was a horrific book.Someone gave it to me -someone who didn't like me too much I guess - as an Xmas gift, and all I can say is Wow! How momumentally bad.When consultants and other biz folk think that, yes, they too can write a thriller, watch out.Save your money, better yet, save your time, this is a flimsy, easily solved horror story masquerading as a biz book."
5,Powerful Lesson Wrapped in a Thriller Novel,"At first, I found the reading tough. I'm used to business books spoon feeding me the information and here I was caught up in a fictional plot. But once I settled in I realized that Waghorn had created a case study that took his ideas on focus and applied them in a real scenario. We learned how management struggled with the idea, how they resisted change. However, as the new idea became real, we also experienced how it focused the team and created real excitement. I read the book in one sitting and found myself using the thought process the very next day. BRAVO."
2,Not recommended,"As it is said in the description, the movie is basically the entire Fate/Stay Night anime summed up in 100 minutes, although it is extremely rushed and only people who have actually seen the full anime will have an idea of what's going on. A ton is left out that would help in explaining the story and even the story itself is changed from the anime. If you have seen the anime, watch at your own risk, but if you haven't seen the anime, don't watch this movie because it won't make sense. Do yourself a favor and watch the entire anime and enjoy it. This movie does not do the anime justice."
4,A rushed retelling of the series,"Fate Stay / Night is a 5 star series in my mind. It has excellent animation, voice acting, plot, action, and drama. This movie is an alternate retelling of the series. The animation is better, but that's the only thing I can think of that it has on the original show. The character introductions are rushed, many of the voice actors are different, and it's hard to sum up a detailed plot like this one in a movie. Even though it's pretty long, it needed more time. An hour and 40 minutes isn't enough. The movie is good in it's own way, but having seen the show first, it left me wanting more from it. I guess that if you want to get a feel for what the series is like this movie can give you a general idea. I think that if you're new to the show, I suggest buying the first volume of the series on DVD or Blu-ray. It's an excellent series. I highly recommend it to any anime fan. The movie is really kind of unnecessary in my opinion."
2,More isn't always better,"I got this as a replacement for my girlfriend. It has a lot of nice features, but (unfortunately) we're considering taking it back... The biggest problem is that the buttons are too small and too close together. The snooze, while bigger than the rest, is in a corner that can be hard to hit if the clock is not faced a certain direction. That's bearable, but the rest of the 5-6 buttons are tiny little circles all in a tight row. The off button is in the middle of the row and I have yet to hit it without pushing at least a few others in the process.Similarily, the buttons to set the clock/alarm are positioned so that it is difficult to change the alarm time with one hand.Finally, the ""Tender Wake-Up System"" is nice, but whenever I push snooze or off the volume goes up to full for a fraction of a second. Just long enough to really annoy me.Overall the clock is just... annoying. We'll probably keep it and we'll probably get used to it, but I certainly wouldn't buy it again."
3,Stores in a blender,"I really, really wanted to like this book. I enjoy stories along this line, with history, technology, archeology, and a bunch of other -ologies... to help support a fanastical premise. Unfortunately, with this story, the author seemed to take peices of Da Vinci Code, Raising Atlantis, a dash of Clive Cussler, some Jack du Brul, and several others - throw them in a blender and attempt to impress us with his very complete research. I actually made it 2/3 of the way through the book before giving up through exasperation of wanting to get to the point.All that said - this is an entertaining story - if you don't mind wading through a LOT more mathematical and linguistic discussions than really needed to support what was a pretty interesting premise. I'd be interested in an abridged version."
1,Awful,"Wooden dialog. Two dimensional, trite characters. There seemed to be a plot developing, but, by page 87, I couldn't stand it any more."
3,"Horrible grammar, good story","I thoroughly enjoyed the STORYLINE of this book - scientists rushing to uncover the secrets of Atlantis in time to save the world from terror raining down upon the sun; ancient mysteries; cryptography, the pyramids, ancient sites, etc.However, I am shocked this book was published, given the fractured writing style. Probably 60% of the sentences in the book are fragments. ""She walked over to the counter. Set down her drink. Picked it up. Drank it."" Etcetera. It makes me wonder if it had an editor at all, or how the book got greenlit to be typeset. The unusual word ""prised"" was overused extensively, and glaring errors such as the nonexistent word ""orientated"" instead of ""oriented"" were really detracting from the fascinating storyline.I'll read another book by this author because I think he'll be able to come up with thrilling storylines, but I hope he attends a writing class and polishes his grammar and writing style."
1,As Bad As It Gets,"Add me to the camp of one-star reviewers who've already pointed out all the flaws of this book. I made it to page 118 and threw it across the room in disgust. How does writing this bad ever get published? Oh yeah, there's television. And bad Hollywood movies. The author should stick to writing for those genres, where he might at least stumble into good directors, actors or cinematographers that can turn his looney pulp fiction into something palatable. A novelist he ain't."
4,Its a story,"This is in answer to all those 'critics' who droned on and on about 'bad science and theology'. This book is a STORY that means that its FICTIONAL (in just the same way as FingerPrints of the Gods, The Bible, Gone With The Wind and the Koran), its not meant to be believed, its meant to be a work of FICTION. Yes, I know the dialogue is a tad on the trite side (thats TRITE not *HITE) but all in all its still just a story and I have read dialogue thats much much worse."
2,A Bit Far Fetched,"I slogged through this book. It took several days. It was tedious and I finished it just to finish it.The book was an odd mix of pseudo science, astronomy, Egyptology, religion, linguistics, and let's not forget the lost continent of Atlantis. I had a hard time accepting the author's use of science, which I found awkward and more than a bit far-fetched, even when I reminded myself that the book was supposed to be science fiction.In the end, I found the conclusion preachy, and I found myself skimming it just to get to the last page. I was astonished to see the pages and pages of references at the end.I will not be adding this book to my library. It's headed to our local school's book drive which is a better fate than the recycle bin."
2,Not So Much Worst Book But Pretty Bad,"This book has a very intriguing plot. All the elements are there to make a great book. The unfortunate part is the writing. The entire time I was reading it, I felt like I was reading the next attempt at a book to movie screenplay. Unfortunately, I was dissapointed over all. If you enjoy this sort of fiction and don't mind dry writing, go for it but don't expect elegance or quality. I don't like writing bad book reviews but I just can't help it in this case."
1,Not So Good,"This book was pretty hard to stay with. The characters were not deep and I didn't really care much about any of them. The plot was hard to keep track of - one minute they're in Egypt, then they're on a boat, then they're in Antarctica, cut scene to the US President meeting with the Pope, back to Antarctica, something's going on in South America... I just lost track. It was almost like it was trying to be The DaVinci Code, but it just wasn't captivating."
2,A little much,"I have to agree with one of the early reviewers who cited information overload. The apparent photographic memory of the linguists was interesting initially, but it got to be too much.Same goes with the plot. I found myself just wanting it to end, good or bad, because I was tired the non stop twists at the end.The story had promise, but it lost a lot in the telling."
1,"Hokey - save your time/money, read something else","Okay, I realize that in the genre of 'the world is at risk, if we don""t do something in xx hours, all of mankind will perish', that authors need to use their imaginations. They should not, however, leave behind all (and I mean all) aspects of believability. This book started off unbelievable, got worse, with the uncanny expertise at which the scientists flew to such astonishing conclusions (all 100% correct, per the book), and managed, with several seconds left, to save the entire planet. I don't know why I even finished it. I guess I just wanted to see how badly the story could go.If you want to read about someone 'saving the world', I'd stick to Clive Cussler."
5,Awesome!,"Wow, what a great book! The ending in particular was breath taking. It never let up for a second. Loved all the mythology and the exploration of human history as the adventure unfolded. But the action was dazzling. I could really SEE what was going on. Nice characters too. Very funny and more depth than this genre usually allows. Excellent."
1,A book for toillet-reading,You will like this book if:- You're in the business of movie script reading- Shallow characters are a good thing! (TM)- Being introduced to irrelevant characters (Full name included!) that will live in the book for 4 lines.- ...Having this book for toillet-reading is the best use I can think of for it (maybe I'm being to benign though).
2,Muddled and silly,"""Decipher"" is not a very good science fiction book, to put it simply. Some of the characters are virtually interchangeable and others worn out cliches (the tough edged military man; the beautiful sassy explorer). Each chapter ends off with some amazing fact or conclusion and old conspiracy-type theories are milked for all they're worth (Atlantis! Fabulous thousands year old technology! Mayan and Egyptian Symbolism!). Frankly, it all became so confusing and obtuse that early on, I just felt it wasn't worth the journey and I started to skim quite a bit. And, by the way, alot of the author's so-called incredible knowledge on esoteric facts had less basis than most Wikipedia entries.I don't recommend ""Decipher."""
1,Possibly the worst SF book every written!,"While I firmly agree that one must suspend disbelief when reading SF, I refuse to suspend all rational thought. In order to read Pavlou's book, be prepared to throw out all knowledge of the way the world works.For example, he seems to be under the impression that US Navy ships are manned by marines, not sailors.He doesn't understand that the Navy doesn't randomly name ships within a class.He thinks that pulsars are the same thing as variable stars, instead of rapidly rotating neutron stars.He's apparently never heard of plate tectonics.His knowledge of geology, biology, linguistics, and symbology matches his knowledge of astronomy.The only think that kept me reading this book was a sick facination with how terribly bad it was. I was like a bird confronted by a snake-- I couldn't look away!If this review keeps just ONE person from wasting their time and money, it will be worth it."
3,An aptly named book,"If you are buying this book for fast-paced adventure with sci-fi thrown in, think again. For my tastes, Pavlou spends far too much time on language derivations and scientific analysis. This is not Clive Cussler or Stephen Coonts! I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages of analytical minutia. Also, it becomes obvious that the author is a screenwriter, in that he seems to be relying on an unseen camera to paint his characters and backdrops.Not a bad read, but not for the techno-thriller crowd."
5,One to buy...and READ!,"One of the best books I've picked up in a long time. The writer meshes pure science with ancient lore and writes so desciptively that it's like watching a movie. The characters come alive and the action... Well, you've got to read it! If I had to say anything negative, it would be that once in awhile the scientific terminology had me blinking... but not often."
1,Not even for teenyboppers,"Seldom does a book annoy me the way this one did. The characters were phoney, the science absurd and there was a not-so-underlying hatred of the Vatican. Not even being religious, I was turned off."
4,Fascinating.,"I am not a scientist. Nor am I a SciFi Fanatic who revels in every word written by Asimov. I like a good freaking adventure tale that throws a lot of new ideas at me. Plausible or not, I found the book to be highly entertaining. So what if the plot is far far far fetched? I read fiction to be entertained, not to be educated. Go ahead and show me a lot of ideas that can't be true. I'll take this fare anyday over a lot of the so-called literary classics that only a classic lit scholar can decipher. Heh!"
2,"Good concept, but a bit too confusing for my taste","I might have been more impressed with the plot idea had I not read nearly the exact same idea of Antartica being the long lost Atlantis in Clive Cussler's ""Atlantis Found"".Of course, that is where the similarities in these books seem to end. In ""Decipher"", I had a difficult time digesting most of what is going in because I felt like I needed a Masters degree in Physics in order to fully comprehend what was going on.""Decipher"" also seems to have an explanation for the shifting of the continental plates that seems a bit more farfetched. Also, the idea that Atlantis could have held a civilization that was more advanced that our own was difficult to believe. Also, the way the world is saved is a bit more fantasy driven and difficult to fathom happening.Forget this book, and pick up ""Atlantis Found"". It is a far more enjoyable read."
2,Amateurish First Novel,"Although the book attempts to raise some interesting ""what ifs"" based on the Atlantis myth and modern scientific discoveries, the story quickly becomes an overloaded mishmash of science and pseudoscience. The characters (and there are too many of them) are awkwardly developed, and have a shallow, two-dimensional quality. Overall, one gets the impression the author attempted to imitate the _style_ of the ""hard science"" novel, but was unable to manage the content.The book does raise a number of interesting topics, and the interested reader can pursue some of these with the aid of the bibliography included in the back."
1,Couldn't decipher it,"I usually don't write reviews unless I love the book or I hate it. And I usually finish every book I read. But this one... just couldn't do it. The first 50 pages where incredible, but then I could only let myself read half of it, it was like watching pseudoscience trying to juggle 15 bowling pins, with card box characters and dialogs of an 80's blockbuster action film. Couldn't believe that people compared him with Michael Crichton.I had read Gene (from the same author) and considered it a good book, that was why I decided to buy this one, what a mistake"
1,Bogus,"It has been a while since I read this book, but I remember it was absolute rubbish from start to finish. I still can't believe I finished it.The plot could have been so much more, but was wasted on this novel. The action was unbelievable, and I could have cared less about the characters. Save yourself the trouble. This book isn't worth the paper it was printed on."
1,8% Silly story 92% Researched facts -- All around waste of time.,"Mr. Pavlou has a very engaging writing style, and is very good at taking a bundle of what would be boring high-school taught facts and historical data, and make it palatable. He actually had me riveted all the way up to the point when the blue 'golems' appeared. At that point, I spent more time rolling my eyes and writhing in embarrassement at how bad it was than I did reading the book. Giant walking nano-bot conglomerations acting like characters they've absorbed... Sounds more like pulp fiction; not good fiction.Unimpressive, to say the least."
2,FAR to much scientific rambling,Kudos to the author for the extensive research. But next time he should leave most of it out. This book was mostly scientific rambling of how something works or how something else originated. There is very little plot left after the characters finish spouting off on how much they know and why they're the smartest in their fields.The religious background is also quite flawedSave yourself some time and read James Rollins or Michael Crighton.
3,Skip it,"This book had a lot of potential, but didn't pull it through. The author puts too much of his research into the work. The characters frequently go into exhaustive (and unrealistic) scientific/historical diatribes that really streched the credibility.The ending also didn't satisfy me. To be blunt, it was stupid and it's exactly what you'll expect from about page 150."
2,Not good enough to finish,"From reading the other reviews, it's apparent that I'm not the only one who didn't get very far into this book before determining it wasn't holding my interest. The ambitious premise of the plot sounded intriguing, but there was not enough character development early in the book to keep me going. The story jumped from one event to another without engaging me in any of the characters. I need to identify pretty early on with the protagonist of a story, but that wasn't happening here. I normally wouldn't write a review about something that I didn't finish, but apparently others had the same reaction."
2,Eyes glazed over...,"My eyes glazed over some 100 pages into this SciFi thriller... hmmm, so if it's a supposed to be a thriller it clearly didn't keep me turning the pages. Rather convoluted story here, and I just couldn't commit to turning the last 400+ pages."
2,Yikes! Doesn't this publisher have an editor?,"I'm two hundred pages into this novel, and I think there's a decent story somewhere under all the techno-babble and horrid prose, but I'm not sure I'll be able to hang on long enough to find it. Hello? Sentence structure? Punctuation? I think I've spent half my time in reading this story going back and re-reading sentences and paragraphs that make no sense due to missing punctuation or poor sentence structure. In a time where getting a novel published is so difficult, and where there are so many truly talented writers out there with great stories that never see the light of day, I don't understand how any publisher could publish a manuscript that is so poorly written--good story or not. Obviously, Stel Pavlou knows someone."
5,Totally Awesome!,Decipher is a definite page turner. The book is really well researched. It is amazing how the author managed to bring all of the different subject areas together with technical data that made the story sound very believable and at the same time still easy to understand. I love reading books that authors have taken the time to do actual research on the subject they are writing about. There are pages in the back for a bibliography of books that he used and I will be buying some of the books because the subject matter was so interesting. I look forward to reading his next book. A definite read for anyone who loves a well researched and action packed book.
4,"If you like science thrillers, you will love this....","This book is a great scientific thriller. It has great range from astronomy to the book of Revelations with monsters and a confrontation with the Chinese thrown in. It has scenes all over the world from Egypt to the Amazon to Antartica with the basis for all of this...Atlantis. The science is great from the study of ancient languages with a blend of geology, cryptology, mathematics, and anthropology and there is great factual detail in most of the description unlike other books. You sometimes lose track of the characters as you get lost in the detail, but it is very interesting. A good read for those who love science and adventure."
2,Judicious editing is always a plus!,"This is, by far, one of the most tedious novels I have ever read. Having said that, I think I would have actually liked it if the author had been able to resist the temptation to include every arcane fact uncovered in his research, most of which did nothing to move the story forward.It was impossible to become involved in the story since every time a little tension was built, the story came to a screeching halt for the lecture. No time was spent developing characters and they became the text version of talking heads with no personalities to make you care what happened to them.With some judicious editing the book would have been half the size and twice as interesting."
5,Awesome book,"With a vast array of characters, incredibly detailed and believable research blending fact and fiction, myth and history, Decipher kept me hooked from beginning to end. A great read.During an illegal deep sea drilling operation near Antarctica the crew of the Red Osprey encounter serious trouble and as a by-product discover a large amount of Carbon 60, a man made material that shouldn't be there.Enter Rola Corp and the capitalist greed machine. Carbon 60 is worth a fortune and bugger where it came from and why. Trouble is Atlantis has been found below the ice and mankind's past is a lot more complicated and far-reaching than anyone thought. A machine the size of the planet is waking and the sun is about to unleash a gravity wave that will destroy all (almost) life on earth."
5,Love My Roomba!,"My mother is one who has everything and needs nothing, so imagine the difficulty I have when choosing a gift for her. I decided on this red Roomba and bought it for her for Christmas. She isn't very technological, so I wasn't sure if she'd be able to use this or even want to. To my surprise and pleasure she absolutely loves it. It cleans even better than lots of the other model vacuum cleaners, and I think we've had them all!"
2,Not ready for prime time!,"The Roomba Red isn't all it's cracked up to be. I bought one for my wife because she had a toddler to care for and little extra time. After the ""neat"" factor wore off, I realized I'd made a mistake with this purchase.1. It quickly accumulated hair on the sides of the brushes, so I had to take the brushes off and clean them at least once a week.2. It took forever to thoroughly cover a room.3. It's cleaning power isn't comparable to an average upright vacuum cleaner.To top it all off, it quit working after about 6 months of use. An e-mail and two calls to iRobot have yielded a ""helpful"" e-mail reply and a voice mail on my phone--neither of which solved the problem. Their customer service is only available 8-5, so I haven't talked to a live person yet.Bottom line: the Roomba Red is dead and we're using Eureka's The Boss vacuum cleaner (a big improvement)."
1,Amazon subsidiary - Warehouse_Deals - A Disaster!,"I bought this unit from Amazon's subsidiary, Warehouse_deals. What a disaster! It was supposed to be a remanufactured unit, but what arrived was an abused, broken unit filled with dirt and missing parts. Customer service hides from the customer and no longer publishes an email address or a telephone number. When a company hide from the customer, something is wrong. NEVER again will I buy from Warehouse_Deals and unless Amazon steps up to the plate to resolve this matter, this will also be the end of my dealing with Amazon."
5,This is a book that you must read...,"""The Secret of War: A Dramatic History of Civil War Crime in Western North Carolina"" by Terrell T. Garren is the best book I have read in years.While reading this book I felt as if I was right there witnessing the events as they unfolded. I could feel the love that Joseph and Delia shared. I could feel the fear that Joseph felt during battle, and his despair as he fought so hard to find his way back to his beloved Delia. But the most intense part of the story was the pain and suffering that Delia was forced to endure. This book certainly exposes the ""secrets of war"". ""Secrets"" that no one is willing to talk about. This book also does an excellent job describing the suffering of those who didn't go to war. I am not sure who had it worse....the soldiers, or the loved ones they left behind to fight in what they all believed in.I can not wait for the movie."
5,It's going to be a movie!!,"It's a great book! It's certain to be a movie. The part of Delia Russell is a sure academy award nomination. It's the greatest female lead to come along in decades. The part of Joseph Youngblood and Nanny Mills are also sure fire academy nominees. Perhaps the most interesting academy award potential would go to best supporting actor for the ""disabled"" actor who gets the part of Wash Hutchison.It's a fabulous story and it's got everything. It's one of those rare books you'll read more than once."
3,Murky Waters of Politics and Murder,"The eve of the cold war in Greece provides the political setting for the murder of American journalist George Polk and the stagy trial that followed. In this thorough examination of the meager evidence and doubtful testimony, what becomes clear is that the ""official version"" was at best a shadowy distortion and at worst a clumsy fiction. Essential reading for those intrigued by the immediate circumstances, the prominent personalities, the leading theories of the crime and the general cold war context."
1,Terrible and unfair,I think this book was a terrible and unfair study of Islam. It uses verses of the Koran out of context and builds a very weak case against Islam. The authors own bias and hatred is reflected in his work and his insinuations as to why Muslims who were slaughtered by Christians was appropriate is disgusting. As a Christian I found this book very disturbing and a cheap shot at Islam.
3,Sammy's Best?,"I was a little disappointed in this CD. I like his Show Stoppers CD much better. I used to own the vinyl version of the album and wore it out.If you don't have any SDJ CDs, buy Show Stoppers first."
4,Great Album,some of Sammy's greatest hits . Pure talent . If you like him you will love this . This is Sammy at his best
5,Supurb CD,I Was Left Speechless . I Bought My Boyfriend The Cd. Every Song Sounded Great. I Would Definitely Recommend People By This CD. This Real Music. Please Keep It. Coming.
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This is a terrible mic clip. Mine warped right away. I contacted ""Theo"" via E-mail at Streamline. I sent pictures of the defective clip and he assured me that, not only would the clip be replaced, it would be replaced with a better clip. When I didn't receive the replacement after 8 weeks, I repeatedly tried contacting ""Theo"" via e-mail with zero response. I finally contacted him via telephone and he told me that he had, indeed, sent out a clip but did not have a tracking number. He reluctantly told me that he would send out another clip. When I realized (seconds after hanging up) he had not provided a tracking number, I immediately tried calling back and (surprise!) noone answered. I tried a few more times but noone would answer...Just wanted to get a warning out to potential buyers."
1,FLIMSEY JUNK,MADE OF FLIMSEY RUBBER. OURS BROKE WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF VERY LITTLE USE. THE BOTTOM PART OF THE GRIP WHERE THE SCREW GOES THRU BROKE MAKING IT UNUSABLE.
1,bad mic clip,"I bought two, and they're both bad. The neck of the clip is too thin and rubbery, and can't support the weight of most mics. Bad clip!"
4,a lovely spelling primer,"Much in the same fashion of his other spellers, Mr. Trocki again presents lessons on the troublesome subject. In the fourth grade edition, the children are presented with 20 words to learn each lesson. The words seem to be entirely appropriate for the age."
4,Great set,"I bought it for my 9 years old son, and he is very happy with it. He says that he recommends to other Lego buyers to get the set. It comes with Commander Cody, Commander Fox, and two episode three phases two Clone troopers. The vehicle is a two seat speeder bike. It also comes with a Clone Turret Gun. This set is better than the new one because it has rare mini figures. It is a very great set, he says."
5,gift for my son big star wars fan,My 7 year old son has been looking for this set everywhere we go.He has not been able to locate it. I told him if he made the grades and went to school everyday I would find it for him. Found it at Amazon.com and can't wait for the 6 wks to be over so I can look at his excited face when he opens it. Maybe we'll video review it later! Thanks for making it so easy and free shipping too!
5,"Great toy, and not hard to assemble","This is one of Lego's smaller add-on packs to a Star Wars collection that can be used as a stand-alone product, too. Small, fun and it helps build up your clone, or stormtrooper, army. My seven year-old loves to build this, or take it apart and add the pieces to other sets. Also, we use the clone troopers and the stormtroopers interchangably. Overall, this is a great toy. Highly recommended."
5,Vicarious Learning at its best,An excellent look into the minds and souls of the 21st century Native Americans. Bravo once again to Huston Smith!
5,Shop's go to book,"I have always loved historical fashion and after the first time using this and Janet Arnold's other books while working in a costume shop I had to get my own copies of them. The patterns are wonderfully drafted and scaling them up is a breeze. Yes, there are alterations that had to be made to some of them size-wise, but nothing worth sweating about. My books have seen lots of use though I still haven't managed to make anything for myself. The details that are provided with sketches and the patterns are wonderful for anyone looking to reproduce any of the garments. That being said, they aren't the best representation of the time period nor of the different classes, but it is still an amazing series of books."
3,English womens dresses 1860-1940,"Very good book showing how the dresses were made. However I found that the clothing that were shown were for the higher class of people than what I was looking for. I was interested in the regular day to day clothing of the average woman, home or working."
3,I have a love/hate relationship with Janet Arnold,"I know it is probably heresy to say this, but I can never decide whether or not to keep Arnold's books in my library. I love the fact that she gives you graphed patterns for historic clothing and her writing is clear and interesting. The projects are not for the beginning seamstress, but are clearly explained by the author. I guess I have a problem with some of the clothes she chooses to reproduce--not all the examples are good looking or typical of their period. The choices seem very esoteric; for some people that is probably part of their charm. If you find enough examples you like I would recommend the books, but you might want to take a look at them at the library first."
3,No pouring lip,"This pan is handy, heats evenly, and is a good value for the money. However, I have one significant issue with it. It doesn't have a pouring lip. That means if you try to pour a liquid out of it, it will likely dribble down the outside of the pan. Many other sauce pans and even some other All-Clad pans do have a pouring lip. This is a significant and unfortunate omission."
4,Worth watching,This is a great spy vs spy film. I just don't get why they won't put it out on DVD. My VHS copy is almost worn out.
5,Must Have CD!!,"I rarely submit an online review but I must with this one. I have over 2,000 compact disks and this one quickly rose to the top 10 of my favorites. The repertoire is diverse and well thought out in addition to a solid live performance. I heard Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony numerous times but it hearing it again by the NSO was like a first kiss! I am not even close to being an expert on sound engineering but this cd is crystal clear and all of the parts come through and are well blended. Being a clarinetist myself, the clarinet solo on ""Shall We Dance"" was probably my favorite behind the Tchaikovsky. I have played Stars and Stripes approximately 1,000,006 times (not much of an exaggeration!) and there is nothing special here other than the fact that it can light up an audience no matter where on earth it is played! Hope this helps. Don Ames"
1,I'm confused,I bought this because I thought it was ed sheeran. I can't get my money back because all MP3 sales are final but they really should BE MORE SPECIFIC. I wouldn't have bought this had I know.
1,TE-RIB-LE,WORST THING IVE EVER HEARD. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE REAL ED SHEERAN. CANT BELIEVE I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS.
1,this is not the same singer that does the A-Team,I found this music to be very depressing for a title of Songs of LIfe & Hope. I do not recommend it
5,Good IT Project Management Book,This is a good book for learning IT project management. The chapters are well written and explained. The book is easy to read and easy to follow. I used this book in Spring 2004 as class textbook while taking my graduate courses and I also had the privilege to have the author as the person who taught the class. It is a pretty good book that I kept and use it as reference. The part of the book that I like the most is the explanation of resistances to change in the workplace and how to manage them.Overall I give 5 stars.
2,Just OK,"I gave this 2 stars b/c I liked the author, but the story itself did not appeal to me. I found I couldn't identify with Ali at all. I thought her decisions and her actions were horrible. This is just my opinion obviously, and again I liked the writing style of Carol Matthews but I was glad to be done with the story when I got to the last page."
1,What in the heck?!?,"I've enjoyed this author's other books. I really don't know what was going on with this one, though. There are so many discrepencies... One of the character's hair color changed by the end of the book, with no appointment at the salon. The author has no clue about Harry Potter, or Barney. There are too many to go into here. All of the little things coupled with a slow, ridiculous story equaled a poor read. Don't waste your time!!!"
1,Poor quality crap.....,"I have had 4 of these fixtures over the past two years. The balasts burn out, the bulbs are hard to find and expensive. In two years I have had 4 burn out. Save the $$$ and get something else !"
4,No assembly.. decent quality,I like this bookcase.. good quality for the price. I especially like how it requires no assembly.
4,Nice bookcase,"This is an attractive bookcase, useful for holding various items (books included), although I think it was a bit overpriced. Assembly was relatively easy and it seems fairly sturdy, so I am not unhappy with the purchase. It was for my son, and he likes it well enough."
4,Outstanding for the price,"I got everything out of this product I hoped for. It looks great, and works perfectly. Not unsteady on carpet, and holds quite a bit! Great buy, definately would purchase again."
5,Mission Folding Bookcase,"This bookcase was fast and easy to set up, and it fits perfectly in the small space I have for it. The one thing I would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves. But that's not a problem if you actually put BOOKS on this bookcase."
5,convenient,"I bought this 4 shelf unit in 2007 and am still in love with it! Is a sturdy, compact unit that is super easy to set up. It arrives flat and you just fold it out to set up. I've got a ton of books and magazines on the shelves and they are not sagging even a little bit. I would (and have) recommend this bookcase."
1,I would give this ZERO stars if that were an option!,"I bought this bookcase based on everyone's reviews, which sounded wonderful. I think it would have been a decent bookcase but I had to send it back because every single shelf was broken. Not just one or two, but all four. This thing was so beat up from the shipping, and I was thoroughly annoyed that I had to package it all up again to send it back. Amazon did pay for shipping both ways (which of course, they should have!)"
3,took two returns to get a good one,"The first purchase--the bottom shelf was broken near the hinge. I thought of fixing it but took it back. The second one--the sides were warped so several of the shelves didn't fit and weren't supported by the sides. Couldn't figure out how to fix it-took it back. The third one. Wasn't perfect but it worked. Thought about taking it back but life is short. I like it, it looks good--I'd probably buy more but what a hassle."
3,"Nice you don't have to assemble, but...","I love the design of this bookshelf. It simply unfolds, no nightmares in assembly. My complaint is cosmetic. Perhaps it is the way the wook was cut, but on the third shelf,is black markings all across the edge. It makes this light color shelf look dirty. What a hassle it is to return anything by mail, so I will live with it and camoflauge it somehow."
2,Close but no cigar.,"I bought this at the local target after reading the good reviews. It would be a wonderful bookcase if the shelves were able to lock in to the clips provided. I returned the first one and thought &quot;Okay, this got such good reviews it just must be a bad apple&quot;. So I returned it and got another one and it does the same thing. If you are not concerned about the shelves locking down, go ahead and buy it. I was buying this for my three year olds room and didn't feel comfortable putting it in his room since it the selves wouldn't lock down."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"I found this book disappointing. I am a solo law practitioner and until now have found Dummies books quite helpful. I particularly wanted to learn how to organize my folders and how to work off-line, and the book has virtually nothing on these subjects. Unlike many other Dummies books, this book has no bibliography of sources for additional help. The book is geared to those who use Outlook on networks at large companies. At times it over explains simple procedures, and at other places it fails to fully explain something or is inaccurate. It does explain well how to use the Contacts and Calendar features. If someone knows of a book that explains well the use of folders in Outlook, I would like to know. This one does not."
1,Worst Dummies book I've ever used.,I go back to Dan Gookin's excellent DOS books. This piece on Outlook 2003 answers almost no questions a home user of it might want.
2,Better option available,"Total Workday Control Using Microsoft Outlook, 2nd Ed.This is a much better options. After reading ""Dummies"", my knowledge had not improved... but Total Workday Control made a huge difference."
3,Outlook for Dummies 2003,"The organization fo the book and the content did not seem to fit our needs. We were new users to Outlook, as we had used a competitive product prior to it. Perhaps, we were expecting more detail solutions to learning the product."
2,Kind of disappointed.,"I had read about this book for years, so when I found it on Amazon in paperback, I didn't hesitate to purchase it. Really not impressed and am quite disappointed. I found myself wanting to know more about the history of the photos. The book has snippets of stories from old newspapers, but they don't correspond with the photos, and they all kind of just sound crazy. My daughter and I both found ourselves saying ""huh?"" If you like memorial or post-mortem photography, the ""Sleeping Beauty"" series is gorgeous and heart-tugging. I was lucky enough to borrow it through my library (the books are very expensive to purchase) and they are very, very good. I'd love to own those. This one--nah--haven't even been compelled to do more than flip through it."
2,This book could be anywhere...,"You can read through all the reviews here to get an idea of what the book is about, but the things which occur in this book did not all happen in just in one county as other reviews from Wisconsin point out and as the author fails to mention. These things could have happened, and I'm sure did, in most every other state/territory in the country at that time. Also, look at today's headlines and you will find the same or worse everywhere. Yes, rural life was difficult in those days, and I agree with WisconsinGal reviewer in her admiration of people living back in those conditions. And by the way, most people looked serious in pictures back then, check your own family's photos from the day. Disappointing book. Don't waste your money."
3,some what surprising,interesting to see how people lived in past times and to see what photos they took too. Even if some are gruesome.
4,Nice Enough Rug,"The rug seems to be worth what I paid for it. It is not as thick as I thought it would be, but the nap feels soft and cushy never the less. The yellow color in the rug is more of a golden brown. The picture is a good representation of the rug."
4,Good deal.,"This is a handy little radio that is pretty darn rugged. It went to South America for the summer and performed pretty well under very adverse conditions. Battery use was great. It now resides in the small Paraguayan village of Costa Jhu, receiving lots of soccer games I am told. For the price, it's a gem."
1,do not get this radio,"This is one of the more poorly made pocket radios around. The reception on this radio is poor and there is no light to indicate the strength of signal reception. Unlike pocket radios made by other brands, the antenna comes directly out of the case and is unable to swivel around limiting adjustments to improve reception. I was so disappointed with this model that I stopped using this radio after a day and instead ordered the panasonic pocket radio, which I have found to be of much better quality."
2,"not my favorite, stay clear of this one","I received this radio about 2 years ago and was never crazy about it. The sound quality is good for a small radio but I was disappointed with the reception. Sensitivity is good on both bands but I picked up a lot of interference from a local FM station all over the dial and therefore was not able to pick up distant stations very well. Another thing I didn't like was that on FM weak stations come in at a lower volume than strong ones instead of being ""fuzzy"" like on other radios I've had. This can be irritating if you move around with the radio because the volume varies with the strength of the signal as you go from one place to another. It's especially noticeable at high volume. The only good thing is that there's a headphone jack at the top so you can listen to the radio without disturbing anyone. I haven't used this radio much since I have another one that works better. I would not recommend it unless you don't live near a strong signal."
2,GE 72585,"This radio does not provide good AM reception at all. In Chicago, it is difficult to receive any of the 50,000-watt stations without constantly adjusting the dial and the radio position. I understand it is small, and its FM reception is quite good, but to take this radio to a baseball game as an earlier reviewer suggested leaves one very disappointed."
3,Ministration of Fun,"Fritz Lang's MINISTRY OF FEAR is an entertaining film. No other Lang picture makes me think so directly of Alfred Hitchcock. One can easily see this film as an antecedent to NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959).As in Hitchcock's film, the tone and plot developments are not particularly realistic ones. The point is to simply enjoy the ride as we trace the fate of our protagonist (Ray Milland); from asylum to fete, being bludgeoned on a train, to being framed for murder, escaping a bomb; and of course, falling in love.It is quite correctly listed as film noir, and has many of those attributes; but it has a fairly light tone, as well. Approached as a light spy thriller; one that has some wonderful noir cinematography, it is a most satisfying viewing experience. It is amazing what Lang could do to create atmosphere, even using simple everyday items like the clock at the film's beginning. A must for Fritz Lang, film noir and espionage film aficionados."
5,Not to be missed,"Many years ago, a group of us used to gather in a small apartment in lower Manhattan and watch old kinescopes (some in pretty poor condition) of Judy Garland. We would always end with ""We're a couple of swells"" followed by ""Over the Rainbow"" which I had thought was from the Ford Star Jubilee. Your reviewers, up until recently, have panned this tape and never mentioned the end; I thought I was mistaken and so put off buying it until now. Well, anyone who can watch her sitting on the stage floor in that tramp outfit singing a marvelous rendition of Over the Rainbow without a tear in your eye must have emotions of steel. The surprise was how good the rest of the concert was, with some truly memorable versions of her standard hits. This tape is a steal at this price. Don't pass it up!"
4,She was the greatest,"Anytime one can experience the brilliance of Judy Garland is time well-spent. While this video is not the greatest in terms of picture quality (it's from the original kinescope), it does show the only filmed version we have of most of Garland's original Palace Theater show. There's a strange cut during the 'Swanee"" number, and her guests (David Wayne and an unknown Oriental girl singer) seem extraneous. When it's just Judy it's sheer pleasure. There will never be another like her."
2,A sad attempt at performing,"It is a well-known fact that Ms. Garland was not at her best when this taping occurred, but contracts having been signed, on went the show. You can see how ill-at-ease she is during the ""concert"" and what seems to be an apparent ""over-medication"". Her voice comes across as thick with a vibrato in need of rest. At times, David Wayne seems quite nervous in his exchanges with Ms. Garland, as her reactions to his lines don't seem to be what was rehearsed! Overall, it's a sad experience. One that should have been postponed. You can tell that some of the numbers are lip-synced to previously recorded material. The closing number, ""Over The Rainbow"" is sad because it demonstrates that Ms. Garland was ill and had to literally dig for the final notes. She was overweight, physically ill and not in any type of voice that could be called ""good"". One wonders where she found the energy to perform."
5,Daughter loves it!,"We bought this for our daughter before she was even born. We have introduced it all along, but now at 12 months she loves it. This toy is one of her favorites. It is very durable and portable and just so darn cute! It also has enough things to do to keep her interest for awhile (plays music, rattles, and the nose squeeks)."
4,hours of entertainment!,"My baby figured out how to press the buttons at seven months, and since then, it's his favorite toy. There's enough variation in the music that it doesn't drive me crazy, and it's all good, familiar classical and jazz music that sounds real rather than tinny, with some silly variations. You can also open up its belly and turn it off or to different, less annoying modes.I hadn't heard about the recall, but I've checked the toy carefully and I can't see anything that would cause a problem. My inlaws purchased this toy well after the recall, so perhaps it's been fixed."
3,"Love it, but is has a recall notice on it BEWARE","I just bought this toy for my son for christmas, and I think it is just the cutest, and plays the best music of all the toys we have, however, I just found a recall notice on it. it was recalled 2 years ago and Neurosmith is now out of business. so, I am relunctant to give it to my child... just wanted to say BEWARE to other moms.... personally, I don't think you should be able to sell something that has been recalled.k"
3,Love the product - but the packaging wasn't what I ordered,"Great Product. I thought it would come in the pictured container. Instead it came in a tube which makes it very inconvenient to use. For this reason, I will probably not ever order this product from Amazon again."
5,Useful tool for playing with lighting,"I use these for setting up lighting prototypes, to see if an idea I have for lighting an area is going to work out or not. Because of the exposed wire contacts, its not the sort of thing you would leave sitting out where someone's fingers can find the 120 VAC. There isn't much detail I can give on a light bulb holder, other than to say that the quality seems good, the bulb base and wiring screws are standard electrical fixture quality, they don't come loose or bend like a ""dollar store lamp"". Haven't had any problems with the mounting hols splitting or cracking despite repeated project use. Overall, it functions as expected, no problems."
4,One of the greatest puertorican voices,One of the greatest puertorican voicesProgreat sons and beautiful voiceConsome of the songs seem to be recorded live and the sound is not too good
2,Not worth the money,"I got tired of spending hundreds of dollars at the dermatologist to try to repair the damage from my youth and to hold off aging. The good reviews for this product far outweighed the bad so I thought I would try it. I have used it 4 times now with no bad side effects like some have mentioned with break outs and such. It does feel a bit warm going on which me me hope something good was happening. At the dermatologist office, your skin can get so hot you need a fan while they are working on you. With this product, you get no actual skin peeling afterwards as the stronger products do. Maybe this stuff is good enough to use in between office visits but it does not replace what the professionals do if you want to see serious changes. I would never buy this again due to the price alone."
3,It's ok,This product is ok if you can't get a facial somewhere in a hurry. It makes my skin feel soft for about 2 days.
4,Good product,"This product is good exfoliator, must be used at least twice a week.The skin feels soft and smooth, it makes easier the extraction of the little tiny black spots, after you use this product."
3,Alright.,"I'm a teenager with acne-prone skin, and an unfortunate amount of hyperpigmentation. It didn't really do much for me- it made my skin a bit smoother, but overall no big change in skin tone. I'm sure it works well for some, but not really for me. It did smell nice and was quick, so there's that!"
2,Save your money,"Tried it once with little results. Tried it again the following week....same exact results.My skin was softer for about a day, that's all...a total waste of money!!"
1,don't be FOOLED!,"don't be FOOLED by all the hype. if you are buying this product for the amount of money they want to poke you for, STOP!!!!!OLAY'S REGENERIST MICRODERMABRASION TREATMENT which is EXACTLY i mean EXACTLY, did i say EXACTLY like the one you are wasting your money on. it is HALF the price or less (24.99) for both the JAR OF ORANGE CRYSTALS (2.2 oz) and the BOTTLE OF ACTIVATING GEL (2 fl oz).buy it for yourself and COMPARE THE INGREDIENTS and plus it smells the same as philosophy's there is NO DIFFERENCE IN PRODUCTS, just the PRICE.....edward donovan cruz"
4,"Great stuff, Skin looks fantastic and is super smooth",Leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft. And a nice glow to boot. I use it about once a week to deeply cleanse my skin. It last for quite a while which helps with the high price
4,Nice product,"Definitely saw and felt a difference in my skin after just one use. Not sure of any longer term improvements it will make and not sure it's better than any other facial scrub but my skin looked smoother, felt smoother and it was easy to use."
5,my favorite skincare product,"In my opinion, this is the best product Philosophy has. It really doesn't take much to give you a wonderful exfoliation. If you divide the cost by the number of uses you get, it's not that bad. I've been using this about 2 years, twice a week. It's such a treat for my 49 year old skin, it leaves it soft and smooth. I love the look afterwards. I also put it on the backs of my hands. I tried a cheaper, similar drugstore product, but my face felt greasy afterward."
2,I hate to rain on this parade but...,"What a disappointment. I have oily, sallow skin with clogged pores on my nose. It did nothing for me but make me break out. I've since used other products with Vitamin C and gotten the same result. If you've never used a Vitamin C product before, try out something cheaper before buying this--just to be on the safe side."
2,Not For Sensitive Skin,"I have sensitive skin, but the Philosophy counter people tried selling this product to me for YEARS despite my protests. Finally, I bought it as part of a kit. Every time I use it I break out within 48 hours after! I get REAL microdermabrasions and it's a TOTALLY different experience (in the GOOD way!)"
5,Excellent,"I am a big fan of the Philosophy line - make up optional skin where less is more. Basic skin care - it is that simple. I love almost the entire line. I use this treatment once a week and it is easy, quick and makes my skin feel and look great. Awesome product. I highly recommend it!"
4,MicroD,"My I don't know if this is just super expensive or I'm just broke, either way didn't like the price, but love the product."
3,Whole Philosophy Line Disappointing ; (,"This product feels wonderful when you first wash it off but no lasting or visual effects. Bought other Philosophy products that did not live up to the hype around this product. Was pleasantly surprised with the scent of Grace, but it doesn't last either. Hope in a Jar, When Hope is not enough, and neck creme did not do anything for me either."
4,Well worth the price,"Had to talk myself into the product because of the price,but after reading all of the reviews decided to give it a try. I will not think twice about reordering it. I did not see miraculous results instantly like many others, but after the second application my skin became baby soft, after the third noticed fine lines and wrinkles are minimizing. Mild pleasant scent adds to the ""Spa like facial""."
5,Immediate Results!!,"I am a skin care junky. I have gone through so many products and brands that promise immediate results. Most things take time to work however from the moment I used this peel I saw immediate results. You want your skin to look clearer, radiant, more even toned instantly? Not to mention the unbelievable soft feel. Then this is the product to use.I am also sensitive in certain areas so I don't use the peel in those areas like the folds of my nose. However this has never made my skin irritaed or red. I am very impressed by this product. It promises to get rid of dull skin and that is exactly what it does!"
3,Nice idea but..,"I was under the impression that this would reconize that it was in the shape cube & sing diffrent songs about the shapes. So it plays music that really does not go with the cube. For example one of the songs is a Tigger song from Winnie the Pooh, what does that have to do with the cube, nothing!"
2,silent lightning fizzles,"Started off well enough, but just fizzles a quarter of the way through the book. It seems the author is more interested in writing tech manuals than he is in writing thrillers. I gave it to the half way point, and tore it up, as I no longer cared what happened to the characters. If he wants to write manuals, he should stay with manuals, and leave the thriller writing to other authors!"
4,Great Action,"To me, it was obvious that Mr. Gribble is a first time writer, but this should not detract techno thrill readers from buying this book. The action is fast paced and realistic. It takes some wadding to get through the character's development, but once this passes, Mr. Gribble spins a story of spell binding action."
3,"Starts slow, gets better as you go along.","Not the greatest techno-thriller I've read, but interesting concept nonetheless. From 1-10 I'd rate it a 7.Gribble looks like an author with a bright future. He can only improve in his next effort."
4,The Instructions Are Wrong,"Panasonic shot themselves in the foot with the instructions for this unit. To set either the CD wakeup or the alarm, it's necessary to hold down the TWO keys connected at the same time (the two buttons that have the little groove between them). That goes for both the CD/radio settng and the alarm setting. Once I had intuited Panasonic's mistake, the unit was a breeze to set up. If you don't know the ""secret"" you will not like this unit. The sound is excellent and the reception is OK. I downloaded the instructions from the internet; it's a shame, because it's a great unit."
3,Unable to read time from all angles,"You cannot read the time unless you are level with the radio.The sound however, is great"
2,Display difficult to read,The display is difficult to read the black numbers are on a gray background it is almost impossible to read it at night and difficult during the nday when it catches the glare of sunlight.
3,Easy to Use But Poor Reception,"I live in Los Angeles and enjoy many fine radio stations. Unfortunately, the RC-CD500 has a sad piece of wire, hanging like a pig's tail in the back, serving as an antenna. The result? Poor reception, especially in rainy weather. Other than that, the controls are easy to use and the speakers are adequate, good enough for the price of the machine. However, if reception is important to you, please get a clock radio with a telescopic antenna."
5,"Good looks, sound, and value.","For being such a small device, it really does give nice sound. In fact, I popped in some obscure CD that had a recording of birds twirping to test it out, and my cat came running in the room. It's lightweight and compact, so if fits nicely on the stand. The numbers are much easier to read than you would think, judging from the picture here. The screen gives you all sorts of information as to what you have programmed, so when you wake up at 3:00 in the morning, wondering if you have programmed your alarm so you don't miss your flight, it's very easy to see whether or not your alarm is on and how you will wake up. The tuner picked up a station 60 miles away, too. The only thing I wish it had is a graduwake feature. But that's about it. It's easy to use. I had it all set up in less than four minutes. The doze alarm lasts for six minutes, and it's easy to find due to the good design. No worries about hitting the wrong button and shutting off your alarm."
2,A cardio-vascular workout every morning,"The sound quality on this unit is good, the set-up is intuitive, and the buttons are well designed, but as an actual alarm clock it's a bust. The alarm is set VERY VERY LOUDLY - think ""wake all the dead on this block"", and there is no way to adjust it. If you use the radio or CD wake function, it uses the volume you last listened at. So no good if you listen to it quietly before bed. And because the numbers become invisible from the angle of (at least my) bed, it's impossible to do a quick time check while dozing."
2,Useless display kills otherwise nice machine,"What good is a clock radio if you can't read the clock? Everything the other reviewers have carped about concerning the display is correct. It's infuriating that the (too bright) illuminated display is totally unreadable when it is at eye level or higher in a dark room - the LCD characters literally disapear, leaving just the glowing background. Where else would you put a bedside clock radio EXCEPT at eye level?The sound is pretty good and the controls are laid out fairly well (well, at least not as atrociously as on most units I've tried...)but the useless display ruins the whole thing."
3,"LCD is a problem, but great sound","I bought this one based on customer comments about the sound quality--and that lives up to the billing. This is not a Bose, but for the price it is much better than competitive offerings that I've heard. One beef is that it can't produce VERY low volume, which would be particularly nice for a bedside alarm. As another reviewer noted, the clock display, with the LCD background, is terrible. You either live with a bright green glow or nothing at all. However, the sound makes up for this problem, so long as I don't have to know what time it is in the middle of the night.Update: A recent reviewer mentioned the buzzing when playing a CD: I have experienced the same thing. Frankly, I would not buy this unit again because of this defect. When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I hear is the feedback buzz, not the music. Is it poor grounding?"
5,Amazing,How on earth has this treasure been allowed to lapse from the active catalogue? These are two of the world's top five philharmonics playing sublime pieces as history is made and emotions run raw. A uniquely special event captured flawlessly.
5,WREATH OF FIRE is one hote story!,"Crisp, fast action all the way through. Full of cuthroat people, like modern American businesses. The greedy psychotic people get slain. Tremendous!"
5,Excellent work!,Wreath of Fire is an exceptionally well written novel. Mel Odom was able to introduce a brand new enemy in the form of a sensual female warrior named Ambika.He did an excellent job in bringing over the tension between Kane and Brigid and was able to write the characters in the manner that we've all come to expect over the past few years. He also did a wonderful job in bringing up new questions regarding the Barons and their needs for ore and computer equipment.The data brought up about the western islands was very well written and I enjoyed the history that he created for the novel. That includes all the history on Ambika as well.This novel is an exceptional tale and I hope that Mel will continue to produce them when he gets the time from his hectic writing schedule.
4,Entertaining and engaging,This entry into the Outlanders series was very entertaining with an engaging new character and new locales. Some of the on-going characters were relegated to the back seat but the book still held my interest all the way through
3,A good 20$ game,"This thing is kind of neat. I have to say the 1 player game (yes it has both 1 and 2 player modes) is sort of tough. ...If you buy it you will have a couple days worth of fun. it is surprisingly durable. 2 side notes - it requires 4 c batteries and a 9-volt so you will want to pick those up, and finally it is really big. Larger than I thought. The base is some sort of plastic-cardboard, not rollable. The box is quite large. Still I think for (price) this is worth checking out. Hey its less than a budget video game."
1,This game is worthless,I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It is basically a joke. I tried several times to get the laser to respond and it goes on playing without anyone actually making any connection with the laser. It's basically some card board and a light that moves.
4,disappointed toy user,"We had really looked forward to Laser Tennis since it had won so many toy awards; however, after 5 minutes of initial play, the laser ""jammed"" and our Christmas fun was over. I expected a much higher quality toy for the price."
4,Good Fun!,"This is great way to sharpen your reflexes but the best thing about it is you never have to chase an errant ball. Great for all ages, too -- and that is hard to find in toy/game."
4,Surprised by Quality,"We were very surprised at the quality of this furniture. We thought it would look cheap because of the price. This table looks better than I would have thought. I also bought all of the matching pieces. We have not given up any quality for this furniture, and we are very pleased."
5,Worth The Price...,"I have been looking for a table such as this for my entryway for a long time and stumbled across this on the Target website. To save shipping I went to my local Target Super Store and purchased it. It's not Thomasville, but for the price it's well made, the assembly is a breeze. It's quite sturdy too so if you need a decent little table, this is the one for you."
3,console table,"Its very nice and study, however, the color is lighter than it appears on the web site and even on the box in the store."
5,My New Love...,"I live in a New York Apartment with limited space, and constantly have problems finding furniture that will look great & fit in my apartment. I ran across this console table, the matching bookcase and dining room set on Target.Com and fell in love. Like i'm sure most of you are - I'm very scepticle when it comes to ordering furniture, let alone - anything from the internet. Quality is always an issue and damage and returns bother me as well - ""How can I return this product that weighs as much as it does if it's damaged?""- My thoughts always...<br />I TOOK A CHANCE - AND WOOOOOOOOOOOW ***WHAT A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF FURNITURE*** I honestly cannot wait to purchase the entire set. The assembly took a complete 6 minutes - and did not destroy my nails or patience. I would recommend this console table to anyone - The quality is top-notch for the money and the look is pricey. Easy as pie to put together - I found my new love..."
4,Nice for the money,This table was not bad to put together and it looks good as long as you don't try to move it around. The drawers are too small for anything normal and it was damaged in the box in several places. I like it and I am happy that I bought it.
2,Looks good but low quality,"We found this to be attractive furniture but was almost always damaged during shipping or manufacture. We bought this an several other pieces in the same style. While the product looked ok, there were large gashes and very noticeable marks in the wood. <br /><br />Contacting Target to get the pieces replaced has been a hassle as they have told us to contact other numbers where we are told to contact them another way, etc. They told us to call the local store and that didn't work either.<br /><br />If the price is half as much as anywhere else then consider this product, otherwise you may find that saving a couple bucks isn't worth it."
5,Love It!,"This is such steal! I just got it yesterday and I was floored. Very heavy, great quality. Elegant is the best way to describe this. I coordinated this with the Butler tray tables. My livingroom is totally swank, think forties fab, glam lounge look! I scouring to the site to see what else I get to compliment this!"
3,Watch the Color,"All in all, this is a nice little table. I did have a damaged corner, but did not want the hassle of returning it. The problem is, I was expecting a dark walnut color, which I assumed would be dark brown. The table looks like cherry and is very red. I had hoped it would match with my other deep brown furniture. Please be aware of this before you order!"
4,Good deal for the money,"Nice looking table, perfect for an entry way. The three drawers are useful for keeping keys, sunglasses, etc. My husband likes that the drawers have a stopper to keep them from pulling out all the way. It was VERY easy to assemble, with solid leg attachments that provide added strength. My only complaint is that every Target in our area had a floor model, but none had the actual table. We were told to keep checking back, but we eventually gave up and bought it on line and paid the shipping charges. But we're happy with it."
5,Awesome Table!,This table is wonderful! We got this home and within minutes had this great table that looks just awesome! The drawers however are small but does not in any way take away from the design. They are big enough to put a few odds and ends and the drawers really do add to the design. We looked at many furniture stores and couldn't find anything we liked better. The price is right! All in all a great buy for a great cost. We did in fact also get the end tables and are going back for the telephone stand and bookcase!
5,Stylish,"Finally, an affordable line of dark wood furniture. We have this piece in our entry-way and a side table in our family room. A friend of mine has the coffee table. I wish there was a matching kitchen set (table and chairs)."
4,Great Solid Piece,I was pleasantly surprised to find this piece so solid. Usually when you buy furniture that you need to assemble they are not that strong. Drawers good have bin a bit deeper but overall a nice addition.
3,Leary of the quality,"I ordered the console table and 2 end tables. They showed up in good packaging but the console table was damaged before it made it in their box. I ordered a replacement and got a completely different but similar table. I also ordered a 3rd end table. The second set of tables were completely different construction, material and craftsmanship. I chose to repair the piece I originally received as it was a much better table and return the 3rd end table. It's interesting that the first set was from Vietnam and the second set was from Thailand."
5,Wow!,"What a great peice of furniture for the money! Solid, not at all cheap looking. Nice hardware, as well. I've received many compliments on this and the other peice from this collection that are scattered throughout my (now stylish) living room. Affordable and stylish. Just a sidenote, the color of this is hard to match with other peices of furniture, but I found that the QBits Dark Alder peices coordiate perfectly with this collection. I built a media stand with some of the peices and they look like they match almost perfectly!"
3,Beautiful but impractical,"This is a beautiful piece, but not very practical for regular use. The drawers are surprising small. Also, because of the overhand from the top, the drawers don't open very far, making it extremely difficult to access the contents. I had my wallet stuck in a drawer for 30 minutes before I was able to get it out."
3,Showing its age,"We bought this table for our entryway shortly after we were married (about 4 years ago). It looked great and was easy to assemble. Now 4 years have passed. The color is wearing off on the edges. The surface of the table and the piece that holds the drawers have warped and now there is a space between them that you can see through. After multiple tightenings the legs are a bit loose (I'm assuming from warpage). So for the short term, if you are tight on money and need to furnish your place, it looks great. But if you were planning on passing this down to your grandchildren, it won't last."
3,Multi-colored STRUTS?,KYB is a great product! I got my 2 rear struts. Amazon delivered to me one black and one grey. I'm expecting another delivery of 2 front struts. I wonder if they'll come as blue and red....what's up Amazon???
5,Rokenbok controller,I got this for my 4 year old son's handmedown set (which came with one controller). It added a whole new dimension to the game. Now our favorite thing to play is king of the hill.
4,Good enough,"I wish it would give me a more ""soft"" looking picture. But it's enough to be called soft. For this price, you can't go wrong."
5,The Begotten,Absolutely spell-binding reading! Be careful - once you begin reading this thrilling book you won't want to put it down! Lisa Bergren truly is an incredble author and I look forward to reading the next book (The Betrayed) in this awesome series!
1,I really want to give 0 star for this book,"This book has given me a bad impression not only on the author but also on the whole ""The Everything"" series in general. I felt bad for myself because this negative impact almost made me miss a precious chance to read another book on Catholicism: ""Catholicism for Dummies"" by John Trigilio and Kenneth Brighenti. ""Catholicism for Dummies"" is the greatest book on Catholicism I have read so far:Catholicism for Dummies"
5,The School Story,This book is about a girl named Natalie. Natalie is a 6th grader. One day Natalie wrote a book. The she and her best friend Zoe try to get Natalie'sbook published. Will Natalie's book ever get published?This is an awesome book!!!! I think that everyoneshould read it!
3,The School Story,"Overall, this book was pretty good! You can keep up with what was happening to the characters, and it was easy to read. It was so entertaining, that I couldn't put it down! There are only a couple parts that could have been better. For example, two twelve-year-old girls publishing a book in New York, and no one rejecting it, seems a little unrealistic. A couple of the chapters were too long because of unnecessary information. Also, it was predictable, so you already knew the ending before the end of the book. This book was interesting because you got a ""behind the scenes"" look at the publishing industry. I recommend this book to someone who wants a good novel to read!"
3,The School Story,"The School Story is full of excitement, learning, and fun. It always makes you read more, teaches all about publishing, and it's mostly being done by kids.Natilie is a writer, and in this book she writes an outstanding story. Natilie's best friend, Zoe, is it's first reader, and Zoe liked it. As a matter of fact, she loved it. She thought it was so good, that it could be published. Natilie decides to do it. So they become a team. Natilie, the author, Zoe, the agent, and their english teacher, Laura Claton, as their advisor. Go through the steps of publishing with Natilie, Zoe, and Laura in The School Story."
2,The Book,The bookWill Natalie's book get published? Only time will tell.The School Story is about a girl named Natalie who want's to get her book published with the help of her friend Zoe and her teacher Ms. Clayton They help her publish her book.My favorite chapter of the book is when Ms. Clayton buys a rental office. She is going to use the office for Zoe. This is my favorite chapter because it is one of the longest chapters. I enjoy these because I learn a lot about the characters and the author uses a lot of detail.I think that the author's purpose is to teach kids to never give up and keep on trying because Natalie never gave up and kept on trying.I would recommend this book to someone who likes to write because it's about a good book.
5,Amazing!,School Story is the best book I have ever read.I couldn't stop reading it. I'd give it infinity stars if I could.If you are thinking of giving a4th-6th grader a gift and likes to read get this book.
5,Mom and 9-year old daughter both loved this book!,"This book is another great one by Andrew Clements and was chosen as our first summer read for a mother-daughter book club. Twelve-year old Natalie writes a story and her friend Zoe is certain she can get it published. Although Natalie's Mom works as an editor for a publishing story, Zoe wants the book to be published on its own merit. Natalie, who is a remarkable writer, couldn't get the book published without Zoe's determination, cunning, and confidence. As an adult reader, it made me realize how our fears can hold us back and keep us from fulfilling our dreams, in that Zoe showed no fear at all. A great book to demonstrate that talents come in different packages (be it that of a writer, agent or seller) and to encourage both boys and girls to pursue their talents. Neither my 9-year old daughter or I could put this book down."
5,Incredible!!!,"Andrew Clements did really good writing this book. It shows the relationship of two twelve year old girls taking a chance to Publish Natalies Book, and what they have to go through to do so."
4,A Very Good Book,"Natalie, an excelent writer makes a book. But, her best friend, Zoe, tries to convince Natalie to publish the book. It just happens the publisher is Natalie's mom. Natalie sometimes thinks about giving up. And very little about keep on going...I gave this book 4 stars because I think it is a good book for kids in third, fourth and fifth grades."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is so awsome.I've read it at least 12 times.It's funny,touching and just plain good.READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,Spend real money and save your bike,My most beautiful bike is gone. Officer Williams informed me the barrel locking mechanism is easily foiled. 900 bucks down the tubes. Buy a New York fugedaboutit and save yourself my loss. Namaste.
2,Broke almost immediately,"Maybe I was unlucky, but the one I received was clearly defective. After the first couple uses I noticed the locking mechanism was not responsive and was hard to open. After 20 uses it clamped shut and no longer opens with any of the 3 keys it came with. Fortunately it was locked shut on the bike rack after I took my bike home - and it will probably be there until they change the bike rack. I am buying a more expensive lock next time."
3,THERE IS NO REMOTE,The main reason I bought this was because under technical data they stated that a wireless remote control was included. After receiving the product the instructions said a remote was not included which means your information under technical data for RX-D10 stating there was is FALSE. Please correct this erroneous informaton.
4,boom boom box,I think this is an excellent boom box for the price that it is sold for. It's amplification capabilities are far greater than other systems that fall in the same category. The sleek silver look is an added incentive to buy this product.
2,Picture is Misleading,"Ordered this for my elderly mother who needed something slippery like leather for her driver's seat. She also needed padding. If you are looking for padding like the (enhanced) photo implies, forget it! This thing is so thin and flat, it's pathetic. However, is does allow my mother to slide into her seat and she is using it for now."
5,"dark, intense, incredible!","i am an avid reader who is ussually bored by ""best sellers"" and instead is captivated by beautiful writing. this is one of my favorites and i've probably read it 5 times in the past 7 years. the stories are about love and betrayal and have a delicious nightmarish quality..."
2,Misleading the buyer,"Vivaldi Greatest Hits by CBS Masterworks (LMLK 45810) misleads the buyer. The CD cover draws your attention to feature artists Pinchas Zukerman and the NY Philharmonic with Leonard Bernstein. This led me to think Vivaldi's Four Seasons must be performed by Pinchas Zukerman. In fact, he only performs the Summer part. A different violinist and different supporting musical group plays each season. There is no way you would know this without playing the CD or reading the inside notes.The second deception is that only part of the NY Philharmonic performs.What about the performances? The violinists who play the Four Seasons play with varying degrees of relaxation and pleasantness. It's far below the heart pounding pace that Nigel Kennedy sets. I prefer more energy, drive and bite.Elevator music anyone?"
5,A Great Show that Got Missed During its Original Airing,"This is a great show with each episode-pair done in two segments--the arrest, followed by the trial--rather like Law and Order. Focused on larger social issues illustrated through the actions and life of the defendent, followed by the trial as seen from the defense's perspective, Arrest and Trial showcases a number of fine actors from the 50s.The contrast between the emotional intensity (always manageable) of this show with the action oriented focus of current shows (or joke-ridden focus) is interesting to say the least.Anyone out there looking for a dissertation topic in sociology, psychology, or media studies? Take a look at some of the TV series from the 50s and early 60s."
3,Christmas Present for Daughter,"We ordered this for our 5-year old daughter who wanted a panda bear for Christmas. The bear arrived in a nice big sealed box and arrived within 2 days of ordering. It was a nice size and a little heavy for our daughter to carry but she manages to pull it along where ever she goes. The fur is not very soft initially but we have started noticing it get softer with more handling. The fur also falls out here and there initially but that also fades out. The only major disappointment was that there was a 2-inch rip at the back crease of the bear's neck that we noticed after a week. We would have sent the bear back but our daughter would not part with the bear even a day. But we were able to fix it with a little thread and needle. Overall, cute stuffed animal but needs a little ""breaking-in""."
5,Something a bit snuggly for a first-year college student :),"My daughter's dorm bed looked a little bare, and this was the perfect fix - snuggly, cute, and great as an alternate pillow."
3,soft and plush,"was a little smaller than I had hoped but little girl I got it for still loved him, and he sits on her bed."
1,"its ok, not great.","This panda is very large. Larger than it looks in the picture. Takes up a lot of space. Many strings and threads are dangling off of the panda, which will eventually be a hole."
4,The bear is a little short,"I purchased this bear for my granddaughter's birthday. Since she wanted a large teddy bear and she is from China, I thought this bear would be a great present. The bear is nice and it is soft but it looked a little small to me. If I stretch it out a far as the legs and arms will go, it will almost measure 24 inches long. That seems pretty short for a bear that is advertised as a 28"" bear, so be aware when you order it that it is not as large as it is advertised to be."
2,too small,I thought this would be good for my dog but when I got it. It was so tiny. Would be great for a kitten or a small puppy
1,This BOOK SUCKS!!,This book really sucks. One of the worst books I've got in my collection of math books
2,for kids,"This book is in the public domain and can be found for free on the web. It was first published in 1909 and contains 94 pages (the printed edition). It is aimed at children from eight to fourteen years of age.The lessons on animals are given in the shape of stories. To give an example of this book I copy the first 4 phrases of this book.""It will be stories all summer, won't it?"" said Betty to her mother.""Yes, dear.""""And hunting, too?"" said Jimmie.""Hunting with your new gun and hunting with your camera.""I found this book to be too oldfashioned and obsolete to recommend it."
3,It's just ok...,"Shape Pilates Workout: Makeover Your Your Abs, Butt and Thighs Fast!I have another Lizbeth Garcia's Pilates DVD and because i liked that one so much, i bought this one. I have to say i wasn't impressed with this DVD. There is more emphasis on the thighs and a little bit on the butt, but there is not much for the abs. There are also two girls doing the workout with her but you can see how they start to sham towards the end. I recommend her ""Pilates on the ball"" DVD more than this one: )"
4,Love it!,"This is a great workout and goes by quickly. I wasn't sure at first about the band, but I think it helps! This really focuses on your but and thighs though. I wouldn't mind a little more ab and arm workout too. But I still love it."
3,Good but room for improvement,I am not new to pilates. I love pilates but have been using to the Denise Austin book. In this dvd there were a few moves I was not familar with and I felt I would of been able to preform those moves better with a clear explation how to before doing the exercise. I can't tell for sure if these moves made me sore because I was already sore from another workout. But I did feel a burn during the laying leg work. I felt there were some good basic core moves and some good leg exercises but there could of been more reps. There was no cool down and stretching segment so be prepared to go it alone. The dvd was good but not great. If there were concise instructions and/or demonstrations I would of given it a better review. I am going to continue to use this on my strength training days but for toning alone I don't feel this is strong enough.
2,Disappointing,"Not very effective for me. I am a beginner to pilates, but this workout was not at all challenging. It felt like a waste of my time. It was also difficult for me to keep the band positioned properly on my feet, maybe because I'm new. The work out was disappointing."
4,Has been a favorite toy for a long time!,"My daughter received this on her first birthday and still plays with it two years later! We've been able to use it for naming colors, matching shapes, and putting together different musical compositions. The cartridge with African beats/Irish jig is a lot of fun.We haven't had any trouble with dropping this toy and it not playing (and it's been dropped/thrown/kicked....loved?). My only complaint is the price! (the reason for 4 stars)"
1,Arrived Broken,"My real complaint is with the company who will not answer my emails in a timely fashion. This was a gift which arrived broken and after a month, I am still not seeing a credit on my charge card, nor am I getting a response from the company. If the toy is this flimsy, don't bother."
3,"Prompt delivery, but...","My only complaint was the box the actual item came in (not the exterior box) was in bad shape - extra tape stuck on, and slightly crushed. This was purchased for a gift, so it was particularly annoying."
2,disappointed,"I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter. I thought it was a wonderful toy, and so did my daughter. After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long."
4,"Classic and, in some cases, pioneering recordings","In the Sixties and Seventies, Nielsen's music experienced a small boom in the US. He's presently more of a niche composer than a major Modern figure. Why he hasn't caught on, I can't say, since I've loved his music from the first time I heard it. Bernstein and Ormandy put out some marvelous recordings (particularly Bernstein's Third and Fifth, the clarinet and flute concerti with Drucker and Baker and Ormandy's First and Helios Overture). Now they're all in one spot. If you don't know Nielsen's orchestral works, you should. These interpretations still hold up, despite some later competition from the likes of Schmidt and Blomstedt."
5,Landmark recordings!,"The prestigious opulence of both Orchestras -like the Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic as well as his distinguished conductors who are now part of a legend- (given the awful actual horizon of so many prominent conductors without expression)make of this album a true referential item.Of course, it's necessary for all hard Nielsen followers, to search and get the fundamental and benchmark recordings of the Royal Danish of the forties and fifties conducted by Erik Tuxen, Larry Grandhal and Thomas Jensen in order to watch the whole picture.The jewel of the crown is by far, the legendary Expansive Symphony; not only it constitues the supreme version never equalled until this date; besides this historical document still remains among the ten greatest musical achievements of Mr. Bernstein.Thanks to the kindness of a priceless musical colleague, I could obtain a copy of these treasures this last Sunday.Believe me my dear reader, this is an anthological album , side by side."
5,Full Circle,This book carries you through the lives of four people from their entrance into college and ending some twenty years down the road. Their loves and their lives keep intertwining over the years in sometimes heartbreaking ways. It's a love story of endurance and forgiveness and coming to grips with past mistakes. The characters grow into unforgettable friends.
5,Note to reader: Don't plan on putting this book down!!,Tesa Jones has written an incredible page turner. I read the book over Winter Break and it became my best friend. I took it with me EVERYWHERE!! Towards the end I would only read 10 pages a night so that it wouldn't be over. One night I stayed up until 2:00 in the morning because I could not wait to see how it ended. What a great summer read this will be!!
1,This book is a waste of time,"this is the worst book I have ever read. The characters are shallow, self-centered and uninteresting. I kept hoping something would change so that I would care about them. After 700 pages - nothing did."
4,"didn't use it, so I don't know","I'm sure it's useful to have. I bought it for writing my master's thesis. Thought it'd be good to have.The internet's just so much easier, though, and I'm lazy.p.s. Don't read my thesis"
1,All the charm of an autopsy,"If you're looking for a fun book about cat communication be sure to pass this one by. It's long on physiology - for example, a detailed explanation about how purring is produced - but very short on psychology: There's little discussion of what causes a cat to purr.The author takes a completely clinical approach to her subject matter. For her cat ownership is obviously a very serious business, fraught with difficulties. She addresses only ""problem"" behavior - as if cats' actions and antics couldn't also be curiously delightful and funny. She perceives bonding with cats as an obstacle for humans, worthy of an entire instructional chapter.Somehow I thought that a book with this title would have rich insights into all kinds of cat behavior. I expected some humor; maybe a little anthropomorphizing; and the kind of warmth I feel from the three sweet little furballs now dozing on my lap. No such luck. It has all the charm of an autopsy."
3,Cat book,"I am still trying to get through this book. It has a lot of interesting scientifically based info about cats, their physiology and behavior. However the way it is written is very dry so even though the content is interesting the style is so boring I keep putting the book down. This has info in it I haven't seen elsewhere so is good for that but is not light reading."
4,"nice unit, headphones are lame","I just received my player today. Overall, the quality looks pretty nice. I did notice that if you moderatly shake the unit you will get some wow/flutter when listening to tapes. I don't think running with it will cause any problems though. It looks reasonably well sealed. The only rub on this product is that the earbud-sized headphones sound pretty bad. I hooked up an old pair of Sony headphones (typical 'on the ear' as opposed to 'enclosing the ear' size) which improved the sound quality dramatically (roughly 50%). I've listened to 2 different ear-bud sized headphones, and they both sound pretty bad compared to the bigger sizes."
5,Stylish and Affordable,"We've been very pleased with this desk for the small space we had. Since we don't use it for a computer, I just put some drawer dividers on the pull-out that was for the keyboard. That corrals pens, the cell phone accessories, batteries and all that sort of thing.The matching bookshelf is a good buy also."
4,Cute desk for my room!,"I'm 13 years old and recentally recieved a computer but my desk was too small and it didn't have a keyboard pull out so we were at Target and saw this cute desk for only 99 dollars. It went great with my room and computer. I really reccomend this desk for kids who have computers. The only complaint I have is that there is only one small drawer to keep paper, pencils, and junk in."
2,Ok for the price - you can get better for the same price,"This item is ok for it's price. In my opinion I could have gotten a better table after the time I spent putting it together. The assembly directions are somewhat accurate. My biggest peeve was that the holes for the screws were either too big or too small. When putting it together some of the directions did not make sense because of the angles and where the holes are located thus making it very annoying and time consuming to put together. One of the pieces of wood had also broken because of the whole angle issue. I also had to put wood glue where some of the screws are because it was not as stable as it appears to be. It looks good once put together but for the money and inconvenience, you are better off getting a different product."
4,comp desk,"I received damaged ,had to spend quite awhile on phone and get a supervisor on line to receive any level of satisfaction. I was told it was up to me to return to a ups store. I veiw this as a major inconveience. they should make the shipper responsible for in transit damage. I still have not received the return label i have called amazon three times, i just might be keeping damaged desk , i won't call again"
3,Computer Desk,"Item came quickly, but it smelled of mildew. Still has a hint of it although I gave it a good cleaning, hoping it will eventually air out! I don't like the idea of buying items that were damaged by water, won't buy online from this store again."
3,"Nice aesthetics, poor design.","I love the look of this desk and it looks great in my small San Francisco apartment. However...the keyboard tray appears to have as much thought as a 1st grade science project. The side drawer, which I love, does not work very well as a support for the keyboard. Immediately after assembly, there were repeated derailments or collapses while working. The problem has only increased as use has increased. So once again, it looks great, but the design could have used a little more structural support. As a heads up, you'll save (pause...keyboard collapsed) about $60 if purchased at your local Target versus online."
4,Good.,It was a little aggravating to assemble. Directions were not for this product. Packaging was not so great! It has stayed together and not loosened up as much as I expected it would. Pleasantly surprised considering cost was decent.
4,nice and sturdy,"Very pleased with the overall product. Easy to put together, nice and sturdy, plenty of desktop space and has a convenient little drawer for odds and ends. Only a few tiny drawbacks; there were a couple of small nicks and gauges in the wood and the little knobs that are to be inserted in to the screw holes we too big, they kept falling out. Still, it a great product and I am very satisfied!!"
3,"Nice, inexpensive furniture","I'm very happy with my desk, but it was wrapped poorly and arrived with some dings. Otherwise, it is as I expected."
4,Just a warning......:),"A wonderful table- just make sure when you put it together to use wood glue (or hot glue or somehting)just to be on the safe side to secure the pegs, i made the mistake and forgot it wasn't held together by much but wooden pegs and some screws and the keyboard supporter fell on my foot.The wood glue helped alot. But not only is it beautiful but very well worth it.I GAVE IT A FOUR EVEnTHOUGH IT FELL APART ON MY FOOT- thats how much i love this table :)"
4,What a great desk!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the desk and the ease in which it fits into almost any space. I also purchased the folding bookcase which required no assembly at all. Yeah! I would like to see more products in this line to fit into my office/den. Perhaps a storage bench, file cabinet, wall mounted letter holder/bulletin board and a wall mount shelf with pull out drawers. Maybe even a wall mount magazine rack?"
3,Be Prepared to Rebuild This Desk,"The desk is attractive and reasonably priced. However, I immediately noticed four serious manufacturing defects. First, there was a huge gouge (1""x2"") in the keyboard facing. Second, the metal guide along the side of the keyboard tray was severely bent. Third, when I pulled opened the keyboard shelf, the face piece came off in my hands. Fourth, the keybard shelf had already split when they attached the metal guides to it. I can fix most of this, but even for this [cost, it] is unacceptable."
4,"Good, small and cheap. But don't put anything big on it.","This desk would be perfect for that jr. high / high school kid to do homework on. Right now, I have my 13"" Mac Book Pro and a 19"" LCD monitor on it (plus two small speakers) and it is CRAMPED. However, I NEVER use keyboard trays for keyboards. So if you don't mind keyboard trays it would be better.I use my keyboard tray to hold notebooks, DS's, etc.I bought this at Target 6 years ago and it's still sturdy. A few of the side beams are a little loose and the lower board (in the back) is loose (from putting my feet on it), but it's still holding up.I would NOT put a CRT monitor or TV on this thing. It's just too thin. I'm thinking of upgrading and when I do, I will pass this to my 6 year old son."
4,It's worth $100.,"In a sea of pressboard furniture, this is a refreshing find!ProsEasy to put together.Looks great.Light, compared to pressboard.Low price.A pen drawer!Other items available to match. They need a file cabinet though.ConsCorkboard is thin. Pins don't go very deep.No tips on legs for hard floors. Buy at hardware store, $3.Mine had some minor blemishes on finish.No provision to attach hutch($59) to desk. Make your own brace.Only time will tell if wood was seasoned. Large pieces may warp.TipsUse bar soap on drawer slats. Mine were tight.Use the packaging foam to cover plugs when taping in."
4,Cannot really track my shipped order with Target's USPS ship,I am very sure that I will be happy with my desk. I have ordered severaa things from Target.com. My usual complaint is that they us US Postal Service (USPS) and you really CAN NOT track your packages until you get them!Happy New Year everyone!
3,nasty defects,"For the price these desks are OK, but I bought 2 of them and both has substantial visable defects on the desktops. Both desktops were buckled and one was so curved you couldn't screw the top of the desk onto the base. In addition, both desktops had quarter-inch indentations that were sanded over but still looked pretty bad. Were these worth the price? Sure, but be aware that the quality is very hot-or-miss."
4,great desk.,nails pre-screwed along side of keyboard tray sticked out 1mm or so. caused bump when tray was pulled out. I unscrewed it and moved the screw to holes below the tray. now the tray pulls out smooth. it was difficult to align 7 nails in locking position during assembly. other than that it's great solid desk.And where can I find that little wooden picture frame pictured?
1,"Cheaply made, terrible instructions","For a $100 item, this is very cheaply made. The instructions are just awful. It is difficult to discern what screws, bolts, etc., go where from the instructions. When it was all put together (at least an hour, no thanks to the person who provided the written instructions) the keyboard drawer's screws did not fit correctly and scratched whenever you pulled the drawer out."
3,"Heart in ""mitt""","I purchased 4 cutters and of the four people using the cutter only one could get the hands to come out as pictured. Once we get the right dough, it will make a great cookie."
3,Great if you have plenty of time...,"This software takes a ""whole language"" approach to learning Danish. If you want to really learn this language, this is a great program. If, however, like me, phrases like ""where is the bathroom"" are more important than ""the boy is on the horse,"" then you should look elsewhere. This is frankly the only Learn Danish software I found and I did learn enough to get by for two months in Copenhagen without starving or getting lost."
4,Not Quite What I Expected,"I was eager to read this book as I am every book on an individual's struggle with OCD. While a worthy effort, I didn't think the author spent enough time concentrating on his own OCD, and a bit too much time poking fun at his fellow patients' symptoms. I was disappointed in that aspect. Overall a very honest account, and I applaud the author for writing it, but his girl chasing habits and the amount of time devoted to that issue can get rather old."
5,There's tons of useful information in this book.,"I use Excel at work all the time and this book is always within an arm's reach. The formulas and functions chapters are especially helpful -- as are the ones on PivotTables, building Macros, and sharing data with other programs. If you're only going to buy one book on Excel, buy this one!"
2,Fair Book on Excel,"First, Excel is a software product designed to analyze data. It is NOT intended to solve problems. Unless your problem is how to use Excel.This book should be about how to enter data, how to exploit the data, how to plot graphs, how to make visuals. It should also be about how to move files, how to email files, or share files. I would love to see how to apply the same formula to every column without having to explicitly name every cell. This is a problem with Excel. This book could have been written in 30 pages. The big problem is Excel's limitations."
1,Cursory,"I specifically bought this book to learn about conditional formulas. Big disappointment! The explanation was short, didn't cover the necessary details like how to use the $ symbol in formulas, and was impossible to understand. I found Excel for Starters, The Missing Manual more helpful."
1,Not for beginners and not for reference,"I rate this book poor. It is badly laid out. Unless you already know how to use Excel, this book would be of no value to you. It's impossible to find anything, and not enough relevent illustrations. The For Dummies series is off my list of reference books. Save your money."
4,Heavy & big,"I didn't realize just how heavy & big this set is. Had I done so, I probably would have bought a smaller size ball. That said, of course the quality, etc. is excellent."
3,Good product,"To the five + times that we have used this Bocce set it has proven to be a good product granting us with good family fun, although I was a bit disappointed to find small scratches on the ball's paint after little use; I would of had hope for ticker ball paint."
1,Faulty materials cause balls to crack in half.,"Great looking set initially. Bought from Amazon, great delivery timeline as usual.We played beach Bocce in soft fine sand twice before one of the balls split in half. They scuff really easily too. What was really surprising was the contents of the ball core. Inside were two small billiard balls, presumably to consume space (see pictures above to the scuffs and broken ball innards). I can only guess that the company that makes this Bocce set also makes billiard balls. In any case, it is obvious the Bocce ball plastic filler material did not properly bond to the billiard balls, effectively creating a built in fracture along the surface of the internal billiard balls, much like a yoke in a hard boiled egg. This is a fundamental design flaw and, in my book, a big fail. Returned the set to Amazon for a refund. We are now looking for a quality, alternative Bocce ball set to this brand. Does anyone have suggestions?"
5,Highly Recommend,"My family loves this set. The Bocce balls initially felt a bit heavy, but we are Bocce novices and quickly adjusted. Composition wise they are similar to pool balls. Sometimes the balls land on other balls which resulted in some minor chips. However, in general the balls seem very tough and resilient and able to withstand the collisions without any evidence of damage, e.g. cracks or scuff marks. The carrying case is adequate to carry and protect the balls. However, The set is heavy to pick up. I would recommend this set to both novice and experienced players."
3,"Putting the ""botch"" back in bocce ball.","These balls looked and felt awesome when I ordered them as a gift and when they were unboxed. Unfortunately, after one game they were completely scratched up. Maybe this is the plight of all bocce balls - I'm no expert at the game - but it seems like they should have retained their shine and luster a bit longer. Other than that, though, they do their job admirably, and the carrying case has some redeeming value."
4,Calligraph of the Middle Ages and How to Do it.,"A well written, genuninely interesting volume with excellent how to and use instructions. The text alone is worth the price of the book and the time spent reading. I for one learned quite a lot and have been practicing calligraphy for a couple of decades.FKA, Heidelberg, Germany"
5,Calligraphy of the Middle Ages and how to do it,"This is a book I wished had been around when I was a kid. A fun, step-by-step book for older kids showing how calligraphy developed during the Middle Ages. With each script, he introduces you to a person living during that time period, and a little history about what was going on in the world. All of the scripts have very clear pictures and instructions, plus photos of real medieval pages so you can see how the script looked. I'm an adult, but I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot."
4,Tra la la,"Just beginning out in witchcraft I went to the bookstore to choose a book. I looked at this one, and thought it a bit small to contain all the information I needed, I bought a book by Silver Ravenwolf and despite the fact I love this book, it was such a mouthful to read and I think 5 easy steps to becoming a witch is a great start to witchcraft. Witchcraft shouldn't be a burden to read up about! This book is fun, humourous and gives a basic ground to begin serious study on witchcraft. Of course the title seems insulting to some, as the author herself has explained it isn't literally, follow these 5 steps and you are a witch."
4,Great Book!,"This is a good book, full of humer and information. Great for beginners! Its not one of those Wicca books that when you look at it or read it, its scary. It really a fun read!"
4,alright,its a good book but i advise get a couple of other books also .its pretty good but i doubt u wont be a witch right after this book .practice a bit more.
1,"you're kidding, right?","you don't become a witch in ""five easy steps."" you become a witch through much study and practice, not a silly book like this."
1,Just reading the title indicates 'bunny fluff',"The saying goes, never judge a book by it's cover, however I am making an exception for this published material. I haven't read this book, however when we see ""5 easy steps to becoming a witch"" I worry. I am not shocked that books like this stock our store book shevles, as anyone can write on the subject and not even know what they are writing about and it is a money maker. Being a witch is a life long path and it doesn't happen through easy steps of supplies, spells and chants."
2,Never buy a phrasebook,"Comprehensive as a phrasebook, but of little value otherwise. Buy only if you have some incredible power to commit to memory long sequences of sounds that have no grammatical meaning to you. Some of my other frustrations : (1) The cassette tape has no pronounciation guide - sheesh ! (2) The book's romanization is horrible."
2,TOO FORMAL,"The expressions, and phrases in the book are rather too formal and outdated. They probably want you to sound polite when you visit Korea, but this is simply not a real life talking style. The book gives a better introduction about the country Korea itself, than teaching you the language."
5,Love it,"I bought this machine at Comp USA on sale for cheap. Tossed in a Geforce 4 card and I was ready to rock. Like the user said above.... it doesn't come with system disks. What you are supposed to do is burn them when u use the computer. I guess it's a little cheap on Sony's part making the consumer burn his/her own system disks, but hey, blank CDs and DVDs are cheap and I'd rather save a few hundred bucks."
5,Love this sandals,"This sandals are great, I got them in red they are comfortable and I pay really low price for them."
4,"Great, but still has some crash probs","I love Sims, but because my laptop doesn't have the high enough graphic card, it crashes pretty easily, and since my laptop is custom made, there is no way I can get to the graphic card to replace it(even though my laptop is only 1 year old, and pretty fast even AFTER I installed The Sims U.) well all in all, even with the crash problem I'm still living, but I think they should have a patch out soon, since of the countless complaints of bugs and glitches of people getting stuck in odd places."
1,Eh..,"This... I could have done without.I've had some fun moments with it, but wow- if all dorms look that bad, I'm VERY grateful I never needed one!"
3,hmmmmm,"I purchased sims 2 nearly a year ago, but ignored all the expansion packs because, i felt i was satisfied building houses, raising a family, trying to get mi kids in private school etc(all the neat stuff SIMS 2 has to offer). But then i thought, why not just get an expansion pack and enjoy SIMS2 in a whole different way...so I purchased Sims university. (This is hard for me to say cause I love SIMS 2 soooo but....) having sims university was a HUGE let down. First of all, I think they should have given more career choices relating to an individual's major. Take for example as a lit major, one of my career choices is a CRIMINAL...why would I want to go to college to be a CRIMINAL!!!For Real I didnot enjoy Sims University...I should have waited for Sims pets (being an animal lover and all). Surprisngly I gave this expansion pack a 3....only because it is a SIMS."
1,Dissapointed,"It sucks, don't buy it. It won't even install. I've bought it 3 different times and the same error. From what I understand I'm not the only one either."
1,EA RELEASED A WHOLE LOT OF DEFECTED GAMES!!!,"I, like many others, can't even get the game to install itself, even after meticuously following EACH and EVERY suggestion and troubleshooting tips. I wasted HOURS trying to get this damn thing to install itself. I have already returned the first copy and now the second copy has the same problem.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, AT LEAST UNTIL A BATCH OF NON-DEFECTED CD'S COMES OUT!!!"
4,The Sims 2 University,This game is fun it is like the Sims 2 but you just try to get them to graduate college I got my sim to graduate and after that is just like the usual game.
4,good but you dont reallt need it,its good because it has addons like drums pianos and the zombie but all it does when your done with college it just gives you more wants which its ok
3,A little disappointed,"I have to say, I was a little disappointed in the gameplay of this particular expansion pack. The whole concept and set up was neat, but it seemed like you had to sacrifice one thing in order to do another. Example: You could either do your homework/papers like a good student, OR you could be social and take care of your basic needs. I also found that the game lagged a little when in a faster time speed because of the constant movement of other characters. All in all, okay, but not what I expected."
1,Not a good product!,Oh sure this game is fun to play. That is until you get a new computer with Windows7 and suddenly the game no longer works. This game does not work on new computers and EA games is no help in resolving this issue. They have no customer service! There is no one to help get a patch or do anything that will help this game work right. Its like they don't anymore. This was fun in the begining but now I feel like it is a waste of money as I can no longer play it. And EA games is a horrible company for throwing away their customers and customer loyalty to their products. Good riddance!
3,Not quite what I expected.,"It is a good addition to the SIMS but not as good a the other expansion packs have been. You will get alot more form the Nightlife expansion. Also, I had hoped that the University Expansion would be alittle more involved than it is. You start college and finish within a few hours of play time."
4,all good,"happy to be in the sims 2....... this expansion is fun, as it allows further exploration into the younger crowd of adults."
1,"Crippling bugs, even after the patch","I'll be perfectly honest, I haven't even gotten to the playing in University portion of this game. See, I decided to play the normal sims section for a bit before going into the new sections. What I found was that the expansion had rendered almost all the characters unplayable. Any families where the maid who was previously present, discovered she couldn't leave. Random tasks trapped sims in loops. Characters went downtown and never exited the taxi ever again...Here I am, a year after the initial release, trying again now that a patch has been issued 10 months later. And ten minutes into the game two characters are trapped, having snuck out and been swallowed whole by a new or unresolved bug.So I still haven't played the University portion. After the patch, this is still a major disappointment."
2,Good concept - poor execution,"Uni provides some nice additions to the game. New careers, some wonderful career rewards and objects. The new influence ability adds an interesting twist to the game. Permanent platinum aspiration can make things too easy though. The new building cheats are a welcome addition too. College life itself can get a little boring after the first few sims. It would have been nice to be able to skip a few semesters and speed the whole thing up and still reap the graduation benefits.There are quite a few bugs. Nothing is more frustrating than having a teen you've been building up skills for college get suddenly sent home before graduating. Frat houses are bugged at level 6, young adult NPCs don't move out of college to get married. That's just scratching the surface. A patch is forthcoming, but it's been a while. Hopefully it will fix most of the game destroying bugs and let this EP really shine. But as it stands out of the box, I can only give it 2 stars."
3,Not the best idea,"A little boring, the time in college takes a long time. Your sim needs to study and earn skills to pass college which leaves little time to enjoy taking your sim through the college life. You have 72 hours after graduation to move out, which means you can live the college life in that time, but you have to go through such a long period of studying and stuff to get to this point. It's fairly easy to be 4.0 GPA, but I've had lower. It might be worth it for the objects as Maxis put out a lot of nice clothes with this, I'm a teenager and the clothes in this expansion pack appealed to me way more than the original ones. Overall, if you spend a lot of time in 3 speed (the fastest speed it can go) college life will take you about 2 - 3 hours of continuous play to graduate from. Once I've used University I don't want to play sims that haven't gone to college, so I would probably say it was worth it... I only regret paying the $40 for it when it first came out."
3,Tricky Install,"If you've installed the additional items and characters available from the official website you may have problems installing the University Expansion Pak. When you get to the install part that says ""This product will now ensure that your existing installation is up to date"" it will come up with an error and say ""update process did not complete successfully. Installation will now terminate."" Then it uninstalls University Expansion Pack. I fixed this by uninstalling the entire original Sims 2 game and all my saved characters and reinstalling Sims 2, the 16meg patch, then University Expansion. Will think twice before downloading charters, items, or buying another expansion pack for SIMS 2. EA Tech support had no clue and asked for the specs on my computer, which is running XP with 2GB AMD Athlon, 1GB of RAM, ATI 9000 Atlantis 128MB video Card (with newest driver), and over 120GB of free drive space. Plays well after all these steps."
4,Confused,This product said it just was the university expansion pack. But really it included teen style and ikea home stuff. It made buy to disc I didnt have too thats my onlu down fall from this product
1,TERRIBLE!!,"I have had nothing but a terrible experience with this game. I ordered it, tried to install it, didnt work! I kept getting errors saying it couldnt transfer media files. So I returned it, they sent a new one, and BAM I ran into the EXACT same problems with this new one!! No more for me I just want my money BACK!"
1,waste of money,i bought this game the 1st day it came out and when i got home i tried 2 instal it but it didnt work it just logged off every time and then i tried 2 take it back 2 the store and they said that they couldnt take it back so i wasted like $30 on a game that doesnt even work....and then the next day i told my friend wat happened and she said it did the same thing on her computer and the same thing happened 2 her...so that made us really mad because we couldnt even get our money back so i think its a waste of money
3,It's ok,"Well this game is really fun when you first get it but once your sim finshs collage you kind of know whats going to happen to the next sim you make.All you really do is go to collage,do homework,and write term papers.Its REALLY HARD to get your sim into the ""Greek House"" and if you do get in, you have to play as all of the sims.Once they are done with collage you play as a regular sim but with better jobs.There clothes for young adults are really bad!!For the girls there is only 8 new clothes,(estamated)and the furniture is ok.If your sim drops out, its like you play as regular sim as if you don't have the expanision pack.Its hard to fall in love and finsh collage at the same time.Well thats all I got!!!!!"
3,Sims Go to College and Get even Sillier!!,"I love the Sims2. UNI is an OK expansion pack but it certainly wouldn't be much of a game on it's own.Sims have to study alot and that certainly isn't as much fun as the crazy stuff they will get up to in NIGHTLIFE.UNI is cool, don;t get me wrong, but if I had my time again ,I would wait for NIGHTLIFE and leave UNI on the department store shelf.The best thing about it is new items like guitars, and some new interactions.Oh, plus a lifetime aspiration.I also like the ability to move Sims into other Sims' homes, whenever you like.The reason I would not buy it if I had my time again is that it causes some glitches.ALthough they are only small ones.My suggestion is to forget about UNI and wait for NIGHTLIFE, especially if you have doubts about the strength of your computer system."
5,"Sum it up in one word, ""WOW!""","What an amazing game. It just keeps getting better and better. Maxis and EA Games really know how to make an excellent simulation game. The Sims 2 University plays very much like the first, but now you can go to college. Your sims can join households very much like real life. You can work hard to get your sim to an excellent grade level, majoring in drama, math, sciences, history, etc. Just make sure your computer has space to spare, beacause it is a very big game that is well worth the 30 dollars!"
2,Killer Bugs,"Lots of bugs and glitches, some funny, some merely annoying, some that are quite frustrating. This game is probably fine for the casual player. Because of bugs, gameplay gets limited beyond a certain point and loses a lot of its fun."
3,Not bad,"I'm a big fan of Sims. This expansion pack was great but it didn't amaze me like some others. The main idea of having the university is a great change to help you develop your Sims' skills, from Cooking, Cleaning, Logic and so on. It also ads a new phase or age into your Sims lives. Instead of moving from teenagers to adults, you'll have a young adult before the adulthood. but that happens only when you move them into college/university. There is one thing that I don't understand in it yet. You can join a ""Greek House"" at university. However, all I found during ""trying"" to join it was 4 mad people wearing Greek costumes. It was very annoying trying to follow them around and talking to them to impress them so they can accept me into their club. It was very dumb. Any how, I'd suggest another expantion pack rather than this one. Probably ""Pets"""
1,Bug ridden with no patch in sight...,EA has let all Simmers down with this game and lack of patch. There are currently 129 *known* bugs in University with no patch in the immediate future.Do not buy this bug-ridden game that EA has admitted may not have a patch for it until after the release of Nightlife. Don't buy Nightlife either...it'll be just as buggy and you'll have to wait at least another 6 months to get a patch for it.
2,Its fun for awhile...,"Starts out really fun for the first week. After playing it for awhile it gets kind of old real FAST. Sure it lets u go to colledge and adds a few new clothes, but i think its overrated"
1,as below,"The product at this point refuses to work on my computer,as it keeps telling me to install Sims 2 deluxe, which is already stalled. After about 2 months of these Sim games, I am bored, sigh, it appears I will somehow have to engage in real life.Wish me luck."
3,Great expansion pack but it is time consuming,I am really glad I bought this and it adds a lot to the SIMS2 - it is neat to see children created in the neighborhood go one to college. It is more interesting that the nightlife expansion pack I bought earlier. Although college has lots of opportunities it gets dull after a while and it almost feels like you are slaving in college yourseld.
5,Merf.,"The original Sims was great. Sims 2 was better.And the University expansion pack is amazing.There are a lot of new items, including a bubble blower, vanity and cash printing machine, as well as new social interactions like playing Kicky Bag (hacky sack) or having a pillowfight. You can even join a fraternity or sorority.Also, I had a problem with stalling and my people not showing up in the space where they are supposed to (on the sims panel, not in the game) but University fixed that. ^_^ Go Sims Go!(I'm waiting for the Nightlife expansion pack. And stalking the people at Maxis. Squee.)"
2,A deep dissapointment.,"I, like many others, have been waiting for this expansion pack for The Sims 2 for a long time. When I got it this afternoon when I arrived home from school, I was VERY dissapointed. The gameplay is horrible, and worst of all, BORING. The load times are UNBEARABLE. And there are next to NO new objects unlike the original The Sims +150 every expansion pack. It feels like Maxis just threw this one together at the last minute and said ""Okay, we're done! Time to work on the next sucky sequal to an okay game.""In short, don't buy this game if you can avoid it. I almost returned it, but I wasn't able to because I didn't want to uninstall it and take it back because I'd loose all my files. Being the stupid girl that I am, I thought ""Well, it's the Sims! It's gonna be great!"" Well, that was rather foolish of me.I give it... a two... out of five."
1,Wish I could play it...,"So far I am very disappointed. For me, the game was not playable out of the box. I could not enter houses, nor enter lots in the University. I contacted EA to get Tech Support, and got an email back that my graphics drivers needed updated. After a 5 hour download, the game still does not work. I found it hard to believe that my graphics drivers were the problem anyway, because the orginal Sims 2 works perfectly.Make sure you back up your orginal files! After hours of downloading things and raising my families, I would have been heart-broken to have lost everything.Even though I haven't been able to play the game yet and give a review of it, I felt compelled to advise: ""This could happen to you."" If I ever get a chance to play it, I'll consider writing a review around my actual game-play experiences."
5,Best of Them all,Even though night life is fun this one is the best! It is so fun i play it all the time and i love it!
2,The Worst of all the EPs,"First of all, I am a teen, not a kid, I just am using my mom's name on here. :-DSecond of all, This game is SO boring!!!-You go to collage with only a little money (Unless you use motherlode).-It takes FOREVER to graduate.-You have to make your sims study all the time and they don't have much time for a social life.-You have limmited amount of cool clothes and you can get engaged in the game, but not married.-This game also messes up your settings when loaded.-It is super hard to get into a sorority house or be a greek.I did not like this game at all and regret buying it. And I know good sim games, I have been playing scince The orignal Sim day 1, and I intend to keep on playing with Sims 2! Here is my recomendation to you guys: Get the Nightlife EP or the Open For Buisness instead. They are much, much more fun!!!"
2,REFUND??,"BEAUTY--IF IT ONLY STAYED TOGETHERI fell in love with the shape and style of this piece, when i saw it at a friends house. However, her problems soon, became mine- No matter what we did the piece didn't stay together. Constant GAPS between the shelves and side panels and the shelves fell often. I've even used wood glue and am now trying new dowels, but to no avail. I own the rest of the collection, and this is the only one i've had problems with. I am inches away from putting it in the dump. What a pain and tragedy for such a beautiful piece."
2,Shelves fall down,"I had purchased this shelving unit from the actual Target Store near me. It didn't take long to put together, but the shelves were smaller than space provided for them and able to move side to side. Since the shelves basically sit on pegs, they were only supported by about a quarter inch to an eighth of an inch of peg... I had placed some pricey items on the shelves, and in the middle of the night, all the shelves collapsed on each other like dominos. Very disappointing. If you have space in between the shelves and the sides of the unit, return the whole thing for a new one...because the shelves will fall!"
3,good shelf,"this is a great piece, but it does have a problem with seperating. It has came apart once or twice. But it is beautiful and worth every penny."
4,Good looks but needs better screws,"This bookcase is very handsome and functional, but assembly was hampered by low-quality screws. The instructions say to use a phillips head screwdriver, but the screw heads were too soft to hold shape. I tried various sizes screwdrivers. This was frustrating. Upgrade the screws, and I'd give this a five star rating for looks and value."
2,Looks good but has problems,"I really liked the design of this bookcase, which is why I bought it. I got it home, assembled it and it all worked good for a couple months. Once I started filling it with books, the bookshelf started to come loose. The back of it fell off and the sides won't attach properly. We tried re-essembling it, but it didn't help. Now the sides keep spacing out leaving a wide gap on the sides of the shelves, and the shelves are falling down. I'll still give it 2 stars because of the design, I just might have to nail the thing together."
4,Looks sharp!,"I bought two of these for the price and they are an exceptional buy! Very easy to assemble...5 minutes, anyone can do it and the finished product looks great! However, I only rated it with 4 stars because they are definately not perfect. keep in mind that when they say ""walnut"" in color, they should be saying ""black walnut"". Not black, but black walnut. I have alot of walnut furniture and these are a shade or two darker than anything I own. Very close to black. Not a big deal though. They were shipped fast and got here within a few days.Would definatley order more of the same."
3,"Looks nice, not too sturdy","The shelving unit looks great - we have received several compliments and inquiries about it! However, it's been about a year and a half and the shelves are falling out due to spreading. We only ever kept towels on it (neatly folded) so I don't think it was from the weight. I plan on nailing it back together though, because it really is attractive."
4,"Looks great, but....","My husband and I recently bought three of these to stand side by side kind of as a wall unit. When you put them next to each other you can see that the color of the stains vary. Some will be more red and some will be more brown. After returning multiple units, at multiple stores, we have found three that are close enough. I think that they great and are a great price, just beware if you are buying multiple units."
2,Wrong Color,"I have the Dolce desk and ordered the bookcase to match. Received it today, it is MUCH lighter in color than my desk! I am sooooo disappointed, I haven't seen it in stores in months, so I don't know what I will do. Plus, that price turns into more after all charges are added in...worth the price IF it matched!!!!"
2,Too difficult to assemble,It looks good. But takes too much work to assemble. The screws don't match. Do not recommend.
1,Product Information,"Apologies for previous review -- found the dimensions (if you can delete my previous entry, that would be good)."
2,Worst bookcase ever,In the past year I have gotten the entire Dolce collection and loved every piece of it until I got this bookcase. Basically the bookcase doesnt stay together. At first there were just huge gaps between the shelves and side panels. Although it bothered me I decided to keep the bookcase anyway. Then about 4 weeks later the side panel cracked in half and the whole thing collapsed. This bookcase is now worthless.
3,No reply,"I recieved the cabinet with a broken middle shelf and have had no response from Amazon,Target or the Manufacturer."
1,Very nice look if you can get one that isn't broken,"I have been trying to get a matching pair of these bookshelves, however, only one out of three has arrived undamaged. This item is packaged very poorly for shipping and all three arrived in very poor condition. The last one arrived w/ nearly every piece broken! Amazon is now refusing to ship another replacement since this is an ongoing problem. Now I can't finish the pair and am stuck w/ only one useable bookshelf. My recommendation would be to only purchase this item in a store and if it isn't available, then don't bother."
2,"Looks good, but...","I bought two of these bookcases because I love the look of them. After I started putting them together, I found out that the top of one was broken in half, and the top of the other was splintered. I took the two pieces in and they let me replace them with parts from other boxes (rather than my having to drag both bookshelves back in), but I still find it disconcerting that there would be broken pieces in each box. Assembly was fairly easy, even though it definitely looks like an assembled piece of furniture once I was finished. I do love the look of the finished product, which is why they even merited 2 stars. If you are planning to buy this piece, I strongly suggest that you check all pieces in the store before taking it home."
5,A GREAT BUY,"I purchased three bookcases and put them side to side and added bookcase halogen lights (nickel) another retailer. It looks really nice. The only problem is I didn't get them all at once, two are a slightly lighter shade! So I have the darker in the middle. I'm thinking about getting glass shelves cut to replace the two moveable shelves. A great buy for all wood furniture...not pressboard!"
5,I love this bookcase,"I looked at several bookcases in other stores and they were all way more expensive and not as attractive as this one. The assembly was very quick and easy. I get compliments on the bookcase all the time. Since I love the bookcase so much, I went and bought a matching dvd/cd stand and that is great as well."
3,"Attractive and cheap, but limited storage space","This bookcase is as attractive as it looks. And it's very inexpensive for what it is. But the design doesn't allow for very much storage space. The shelves are very narrow; you can only fit about ten books on each shelf. And, if you buy two of these and put them side by side as I did, you end up wasting a lot of space because of the way the tops of each bookcase touch together. The wasted space ends up being substantial. Had I bought a single large bookcase instead of these two narrow bookcases, I think I would have had nearly twice the storage room. Still, for this price, it wasn't a bad option."
5,The shipping was fast,I was please with how fast I recieved my product. I would use this vendor again.
3,Frequently Assigned Text in IR Seminars,"Finnemore's text is frequently assigned in International Relations seminars and comes from the constructivist paradigm. Future texts of this nature might focus more on norms that depart from the ""sunny optimism"" that many constructivists seem to hold close to their hearts."
4,A great little read,"If your new to the game of golf or an old hand you will enjoy A Brief History Of Golf. Easy to read and packed with facinating facts, this little volume will familiarize the novice and thrill the veterans of the game."
2,What it had been Arif Mardin instead of Lelan Rogers?,"Much as I've tried, I find this long lost CD from Bettye LaVette's Silver Fox days hard to listen to. It lacks sparkle and ""Piece of My Heart"" does not compare with the original Erma Franklin version on Bang. With Ms. LaVette and the Dixie Flyers being known entities - the blame can be squarely laid to the producer, Lelan Rogers whose production efforts pale in contrast to the magnificent work of Arif Mardin on Dee Dee Warwick with the Dixie Flyers (""To The Other Woman"") at Criteria that was released on Atco. Betty's latest CD re-release (5/08) on Reel, the long out of print Motown album, like her Atco album with Brad Shapiro on Atlantic/Rhino are far superior to this album."
3,Banana Leaf house with tower,"My cat Jasper loves to sleep inside the litle house, I think he feels safe and secure inside. He chews on the twigs a little too. He will jump up on top and look out the window and will get toys if you put them up there. But he doesn't scratch the post, which is why I bought the tower, I put catnip and catnip spray on it and he's still not interested in scratching it...Good deal for the $ but I just wish he'd like to scratch the post..."
3,Pearls in Vinegar: The Pillow Book of Heather Mallick,"Amusing book, quite funny in parts. Very easy reading in one sitting.A bit of fluff, not serious reading."
4,Fun/Different,"This story is unique and different. Not so much because of the story line, which is fresh and interesting, but the author has a fresh style. I enjoyed the suspense and mystery very much. Good quick read."
2,Not That Great,this book is light on content. It covers the obvious benefits of business blogs but nothing worth the price and the hype.
5,A Useful Tool for Business Bloggers,"This book provides a good introduction to the purpose, creation, care, and feeding of a business blog. The writing is clear and the explanations make sense so you come away with a good understanding of the subject. The case studies add both credibility to the authors' assertions and provide good real-world examples of the value of blogs to a business. We used the book in setting up our company's blog and the book gave us some good ideas that gave our blog a wider applicability. Recommended."
5,Couldn't put it down,"This too little known book deserves to be on everyone's bookshelf. Walter Truett Anderson is a great raconteur of the highest caliber. And the story there is to tell! The only wonder is why this hasn't been made into a movie...the stories are sooooo interesting and the cast of characters in the first chapter alone would make the book worthy of attention...from Joan Baez and Hunter Thompson (one can only imagine what he was like as ""security guard/caretaker"") to gay bathers, Hell's Angels and Big Sur's bohemian artistes like Henry Miller...what a time.This book seems like a worthy memoir of it all. A sort of collective Big Chill for the rest of us."
4,just what I needed,good bait bucket. works well on my bass boat not much more you can say about a bait bucket.. now go fishing!
4,Adequate,I think this bucket will do the job for a days fishing. The inside piece is a little smaller than I would like and the bucket is not insulated. We'll give it a thorough test.
1,Dear God...,"Seriously, America, you constantly point the fingers at other countries, cultures and times in history for political propaganda, but you cannot see it when it stares you in the face. Because you've been raised in it, no less, and it's all you know. This ridiculous ""in-depth"" exercise is up there with the recent ""no holds"" Queen doco, for being one giant PR exercise. That another reviewer here calls the last few years the most ""hopeful"" time in America added an extra dimension of disturbance for me, and I watched this only out of morbid curiosity. Let's hope that one day America, like the rest of the Western world, can remember this president for what he really was and what he actually did to our world. Thanks be to George."
1,Observation,"Hello Super Alpha Stud:I read your review and have observed in regards to your review of this President you have; re-written history, ignore the facts, condone mass murder, look upon other Americans who don't agree with you as enemies of the state - you are an excellent Repuplican."
1,george w. bush fighting to the finish,"as soon as i saw Faux News stamped on dvd sleeve i laughed my arse off!!!i knew they would glorify Bush and make him look like some saint.responsible for invasion of sovrign nations (IRAQ AFGANISTAN) WTC Towersinside job and JOHN F. KENNEDY JR. murdered by C.I.A dark forces within the militay and Pentagon.Did you all know that the Coast guard was not allowed to search for wreckage for 15 and half hours after JFK JRs plane was reported missing!!!by the Kennedy family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i tried my hardest not to give any stars at all!as i was watching this i was rubbing my eyes with sandpaper and drillingholes in ears and feet.thanx, Darth Platapuss"
1,Like Soviet progaganda,This was the worst piece of 'journalism' I've ever seen - reminiscent of Communist-era propaganda film making. Hardly a fitting portrait of the worst president of all time. Avoid like the plague
5,THANK YOU,"I just watched the interview on FNC of President Bush and I can't wait to see it again! To the President I would like to say 'THANK YOU' for not backing down on your convictions and giving in to the left liberal machine that now threatens the core of American values. I have stood with him from day one in office, and truely believe he will be regarded as a tireless fighter who fought to protect this nation from aggressive evil terrorist. They wouldn't think twice about cutting the heart of this nation out and they surly won't back down. The FORMER President Bill you know who was the real joke!!He and his puppet wife make me nervous wondering how they'll sell out the country for their over inflated egos. If she wins the election it will mark the first time in history that the US will have two Presidents at once. And even with two heads between them and Ivy degrees, they'll really mess this nation up and shame us to the world. I pray to GOD for the sake of this GREAT NATION!!!"
5,Inspirational for every Christian soldier,"To view this program on God's chosen network Fox News was transformational to those who viewed it. George W. Bush has lead the charge for our Christian nation to execute Gods' will and sometimes just ""execute"" those who stand in the way. Fox News has long been a leader in news and information programming and wonderful special's such as this masterwork. This news special DVD by great measure frees the timid who may pause before considering US preemptive invasion of foreign nations to liberate the ten's of thousands of their lives and natural resources. Fox News shows the viewers that their decorated Silver Star, Purple Heart, Vietnam War Veteran George W. Bush means what he says and knows from his combat experience in the Texas battlefields qualifies him to lead our nation into battle for our life preserving Christian values regardless of the unlucky innocents crushed under US tank treads. I solute you Fox News for this incredible DVD masterpiece!"
4,Fox Does It Again!,We had seen this DVD/interview by Fox when they aired it on TV. It is a well done DVD and gives a little different perspective then a lot of Presidential interviews. Highly recommend Fighting to the Finish:George W. Bush.
2,Fluff. It's a PR piece that doesn't go deep. Was produced by Fox News so it's very biased,"You can't polish a turd. The interviewing in this show doesn't go deep and not once was the president asked to explain some of his answers that made no comprehensible sense. Clearly Bush is going down. And granted, he is an inarticulate guy, and he's inarticulate in this show. This piece was aired on Fox News which just goes to prove it's a fluff piece to try to make Bush look good. If you're of the 10% of the US population who somehow believes Bush has done a fine job, mainly because you watch Fox News Channel, then you'll probably LOVE this DVD because it investigates nothing. Instead it attempts to inflate a deflated man in the eve of his final term. And it fails."
1,Who else but....,FOX news could produce such a sugar coated piece. when the rest of the world CANT WAIT to get rid of this dude.... there is NO room for praise - only for regrets:-(
3,sina's opinion,"I bought this cookware half years already, they look very nice, and the most thing I really like it is very light. but the big problem is the lid doesn't have a hole on it, so one time I cooking the soup, after I turn off the fire, half hour later, the lid was stocking with the sauce pan, so I can't take the lid off. At last, I have to call my husband to find some tool to open it!"
3,Nice set but one major flaw...,"I recently bought this set off amazon after seeing the percentage of people buying this item. The item arrived in proper fashion and all the items look great.However, I discovered one major flaw(s) the next day which are the metal cover and the handles for the utensils. Once these vessels are put on the gas flame, the extra long handles kinda feels a little too warm AND just in case you feel that you want to see how things are cooking - just lift the steel cover of the vessel and there you would know the true flaw - Which is the lid of these vessels gets hot and so you would surely feel the real heat by touching the upper tip of the lids. So you cannot hold the small knob on the lids as it is as hot as the vessel itself.That's it for this item."
4,Pretty good case - could be better,"Zipper tends to hang up. Accessory compartment is on the small side - hard to fit even a sleeve of choke tubes in there. Case looks durable but mine is already showing signs of wear and tear and it hasn't really seen all that much use. Overall not a bad product for the money, but could be better."
5,Great Company,This company went above and beyond to get this here by Christmas!!!! and it made it... Thanks to all who made the effort.. Happy New Year :)
5,shotgun case,"I thought it was very well constructed and was long enough for my 30"" barrell and extended choke. I am very happy with it."
1,"CD eater, not player!","Beware of this product! I recently purchased one, and though it seemed OK at first, I soon found out it had this annoying quirk of wanting to eat any CDs put into it. A CD will go in fine, and it will even play OK, but when you go to take it out of the player, it's a gamble as to whether you'll actually see it again without a mess of trouble. In one case, my CD got stuck *way* in the back of the unit, and I had to *remove* the whole unit from underneath the cupboard to which it was mounted, turn the thing upside down, and *shake* it to get the CD to come back out. Needless to say, one shouldn't have these kinds of problems with a player that's designed to be permanently mounted to a surface. If you must buy this, make sure there's a good return policy in place! GE really screwed up this one."
5,Love it!,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas last year and I absolutely love it! I put it in the kitchen because there's nothing like dancing while you're cooking. Of course, the sound isn't stereo quality, but we can put a CD in, turn it up loud (no crackling either!) and hear it all over the house. Well worth the money. We like it so well we're buying one for my parents this year!"
2,"Nice, but radio's sound was very poor","We bought one and tried it on the counter before installing. The radio, on all stations, had a deep roaring sound in the background. Our current boombox sitting on the counter works fine. We thought there was something wrong with it, so we returned it and got another. Same problem, so we had to return that one too. We are looking for another similar product, but have been unable to find anything else."
1,What a hunk of junk!,"Save yourself the headache and skip this product. I love GE products, but we have now had 3 of these GE under-the-counter radios/CD players and every single one is defective. The CD player is the worst ever. If you are lucky, it starts to play. Eventually, it starts messing with the sound with the oh so wonderful fade/in-fade/out skipping noises reminescent of your old 45's with scratches. The forward feature on the CD player is even more cantankerous & usually stops the CD from working at all. Finally, usually mid-way through the CD, it just stops advancing tracks. The reception on the radio is beyond awful. All three of the models I purchased had the same inherent flaws. Save yourself from having to mail this back & from drilling holes in your kitchen cabinets. Buy another brand."
1,Terrible Reception,"A real disapointment. It replaced an older under-the-cabinet GE radio that worked well, but blew up after a power surge. It only gets a few stations, and even those fade periodically. Most stations are accompanied by an annoying buzz, whirr or whine. I have finally had enough, and am replacing it with a comparable Sony. How many holes can my cabinets stand before they collapse?"
2,The Humming Radio,"Bought the GE spacemaker CD player for my wife for Christmas 2002. Prior to installing, tried unit on counter top. CD worked/sounded fine but the radio (both FM and AM) had a loud 'hollow' whirring sound. Too annoying to listen to, so I will be returning this unit. Interesting that another person posting a review had the exact same problem! I think I will drop GE an email to let them know that there is obviously a flaw with the radio's tuner."
2,mixed emotions,"I like the topic, but I expected this to be ""more"" than a home-made video (dvd). I also expected this to be more of an audio type version of the book with recipes. It was nothing more than going to an auditorium listening to a speech. They didn't even tape the Q&A at the end."
2,An almost good rocket,"I would not recommend this rocket. It may look cool,but when you get it and get a real look at it,its really not well made at all.When I lauched it, it went high,but it came down to us in pieces.I say do not waste your money on this."
4,Ultra soft indeed,"I was a bit dubious about the cotton/rayon blend at first, but the duvet cover and matching sheets are soft beyond compare to any others that I own. After first washing them before use, there was so much lint that came off in the dryer, and the sheets and duvet cover ended up feeling pretty thin. So it's a very ""light"" set, and yet I've found them still quite warm for the summer. I do wonder how well they will hold up with repeated washings. I don't have a problem with wrinkles, as I don't mind a bit of the soft--rather than completely tidy--look. All in all so far, they've definitely exceeded my expectations."
2,Wrinkles anyone?,"The fabric has a nice feel - as advertised. It's very pretty. However, the wrinkles are awful. I haven't yet tried ironing it, but a trip through the laundry according to directions leaves me with something that I would not put on my bed without ironing the wrinkles out. I'm still trying to decide what to put inside. Same general comment is true for the sheet set, though I have been using them.I would not pay full price for this."
1,The fabric does not look anything like the picture!!!,"In the picture, the fabric looks like it's a silvery color....when you open the package, it looks like something straight from the '80's. The fabric is light blue, with little white splotches all over it...it kind of looks like white splatters. I am extrememly disappointed."
3,Research better next time,"When I saw the gold box deal I had no idea what a duvet was. A google search lead me to believe tha a duvet was another term for a down comforter.Surprise! From what I can gather by holding this duvet is that it is a cover for a down comforter??Upon further research I discovered that there is a duvet cover, and a duvet (down comforter). I would have appreciated Amazon being a bit more descriptive, I would not have bought this had I known it was just a cover.I will keep this product instead of going through the hassle of returns etc..(even though amazon has been real good about returns).The product is soft and thin therefore making a good cover for the hot summer nights."
2,Deceptive description,"This set is described as including a duvet. It does not. Rather, it contains a duvet cover. I haven't used it yet, so it is difficult to talk about the quality (seems nice from touching it while trying to figure out where they hid the duvet), but I wanted to make sure people knew about the false description."
4,A Lost Treasure!!!!!,"This is a great album! It was produced in 1975 by veterans Hal David and Burt Bacharach. This collection is much more pop oriented than Stephanie's later material, but what is here is excellent. My favorite cuts are the great opening track ""I Took My Stength From You"", ""Living On Plastic"", ""If You Can Learn How to Cry"" and the Dionne Warwick remake ""This Empty Place"". Definitely worth searching out, not just for fans of Stephanie, but anyone who appreciates good music sung by a great artist."
4,Pretty good,"This book was a pleasant surprise. The two women who wrote it under a psuedonymn (see copyright page) did an amazingly credible job of portraying a reasonably accurate view of damaged veterans. A few incidents reminded me of David Drake characters. This is a decent read if you are in the mood for a self contained, and reasonably absorbing, fantasy novel. Some of the characters are a little flat, but many scenes are worth while."
4,Most intelligent design i've ever seen,"David Mead has taken all the fat and left the meat in this guide for guitarists of all skill levels. These are the questions you should be asking but didn't know how or what to ask for.Has missed out on a couple subjects of which I thought was important(like left hand technique). Over all however, this is the most intelligent book to motivate and inspire a guitarist who wants to enjoy the journey to mastering an instrument.I work in a music shop so I am subjected to a whole lot of useless literature on the subject of learning guitar.i hope it works out for you as well as it did for me."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I bought this book hoping it would be like the little golden books i grew up with. There was maybe one story in this book that i had as a child. There were no stories that i was looking forward to sharing with my son; little red ridding hood, goldilocks and the three bears, etc. I know little golden did those stories because i had them. So far none of the stories I have read in this are even worth reading twice. So disappointed!"
4,A great collection at a good price,"It amazes me how expensive children's books are these days! Well, here's a way to get more for your money... a collection of favorites from a respected children's book publisher, Golden Books, for a price that won't break the bank. Especially for 46 stories! So if you have kids who like to read (or you like to read to!), this is a great addition to any library. Also a great way for a grandparent to have several kids books without the mess of lots of individual books."
2,Not sure about this version,"I am not sure if this is the same book I had when I was a child. But there was a book called The Big Red Book of Little Golden Books, it was a superior book.This book not only had the Little Golden book classics such as Tawny Lion,Pokey the Little Puppy but had poems,Mother Goose fairy tales,ABC's,it had everything!It had bright colorful illustrations,this was the best book ever.It had great craftsmanship and was hardcover.I called Random House and to my dismay they said they have no record of this masterpiece! I was broken up but this item sounds like an updated version of the book.It sounds like nobody wanted to take time to put in the illustrations. RH should have just re-issued the original of this book;it would have been money well spent."
4,"Lots of stories, few pictures.","This book was a great value and I got lots of the little golden book stories I remember from when I was a kid, now all packed into one book. Unfortunately, there aren't too many pictures and there are lots of words on each page, making it hard to get my son to sit through."
4,A good starting point for my new sport,"Being new to the world of kayaking I found this DVD to be an informative and quick place to begin. Concise and to the point, it walked me through the basics and delivered on what it promised. For those just getting into kayaking it's a bargin, especially when compared to how much a private lesson costs at my local outdoor center. If you're looking for super advanced kayaking techniques, or tips on kayak camping you're best to look elsewhere, but if you're looking to get started in this captivating sport, its as good of a resource as I've come across so far."
3,BEGINNING KAYAKING - ONLY!!!,"I am completely new to kayaking. The information that was presented was excellent - proper equipment, how to put the kayak into the water, how to get into the kayak from dock or shore, different paddle strokes, defensive maneuvers to avoid capsizing, and how to recover from capsizing. However, there was nothing on how to paddle a tandem kayak, how to deal with wakes from passing power boats or how to deal with waves in open water. Those three areas are of most concern to me and were not covered at all in the DVD. That is why I gave it a rating of 3 ***. Much of what was presented is intuitive. I may have spent the money on the DVD anyway, but I wish that I would have had a review like this one to read before I bought it."
3,For beginners,"Great video if you are kinda afraid of your first kayak experience but you wanna do it. The video is amatorial, but explains everything you need to know. Some areas are not covered like currents and waves which are really important for the beginner."
1,Waste of Money,"I cannot understand how this video can be rated higher than one star. It has almost no information at all. It is so basic, that it cannot even be considered as instructional. And the editing? Horrible! If you like watching a DVD where the people's heads are cut off continually throughout the DVD, you will enjoy this. I have found more useful short videos available to view from internet sites and they contain way more information. The price is ridiculous for what is contained in this video. It should be more like $4.99. I am so sorry that I spent the money on this DVD. Do not consider it an instructional DVD...especially if you already know what a kayak or a paddle look like. I'm not kidding. After watching it, you'll ask yourself, ""That's it?!"" I threw out this DVD after watching it once."
5,The best monograph ever written about Heloderma,"_The Gila Monster and Its Allies; The Relationship, Habits, and Behavior of the Lizards of the Family Helodermatidae_ is the classic work on the topic. This reprint of the 1956 edition is updated with a new preface. It contains the ecology, Natural History, morphology, and complex behaviors of these unique venomous lizards of America, Mexico, and Central America. Illustrated with B/W photos, graphs, maps, and drawings."
5,A Superb Book,"This book is a most useful one - to say the least - for those of us, within the Church, grieved by these scandals and the utterly appalling manner in which they have been/are being handled. This excellent book should be required reading for bishops and priests everywhere.Sadly, it would appear that there is not much enthusiasm among many clergy for being educated about the nature and extent of the evil that has devastated so many lives. That in itself is a terrible indictment of many in the institutional Church.There are many false shepherds and - in Jesus' words - ""hired hands"", who DO NOT CARE about those wounded and torn by ""wolves within the fold"". They have sympathy for - and affinity with - their ""brother priests"" who are, in fact, sexual predators; and no love or compassion for their victims whose lives are so deeply scarred."
3,If you like footnotes. . .,"I found the title to be the only thing intriguing about this book. There is very little original material here, but an exhaustive list of attributions without conclusions.If you expect a juicy, previously unrevealed account of clerical sexual transgression, lurid and sinister Vatican alliances with searing moral conflict, you'd better go back to the Da Vinci Code, because you won't find them here.The only thing I gleaned from this book is that the recent sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic clergy is a time-honored tradition. From Castrati to catechism kids the abuse has passed by the uncensoring eyes of popes, cardinals and bishops since women were banned from the priesthood.This book documents the shame of it all, but there is nothing new under the sun."
3,It's A Sufficient Clock Radio,"For me, I really don't need much in a clock radio. All I need from it is that it will wake me up on time and last a long time. I have owned a similar model of this GE model, but when I moved to college, I bought this model and its about the same as the other one I had. It has that really irritating alarm sound, but it works fine. But the radio tuning is kind of poor, just like my other one. If you are going to buy a clock with radio capability, this product is not for you. Try some other clock/radio."
4,Good Reading -Especially for Young Professionals,"(The word ""girls'"" in the title is misleading, since this book is for women.) I found this book enlightening and helpful, especially for younger women just beginning their careers. Each chapter was inspirational, and encouraged me to be an informed, powerful, and successful woman."
4,Do I need it?,"I asked my self that a few times and never really answered. If you do new construction chances are about the only time you will need to use it is if a screw strips in a box or fixture, witch it not often. Now if you do a lot of service work, a technician that works on control/push button stations or you do a lot of custom enclosures then I would think about getting it. You never know when your going to run into a rusted out screw, need to attach a removable terminal bar or the odd cable rack supports in explosion proof boxes. You never know... I got one (well not this one), It's save me time and money a few times plus it adds to my collection of things I don't really need hehehe.I personally got the CAT No. 627-20 6-in-one, I figured the more taps I had together the more vestal it would be."
5,One of the best albums ever!,"With out any doubt, this is David Grisman's greatest collaboration... It is one of my favorite albums of all time. The music is timeless and uplifting. The musicianship is incredible, the cohesion of the group is amazing, and the song selections are great. The fact that this LP has never made it to CD is unbelievable."
4,This is not the same one that price grabbers and other search bots show,I have an HP sport backpack and it looks nothing like this. This one doesn't appear to have the same features of the one I have. The one I have is great and I was looking to get another but I want that one not this.
5,Spiritual vitamins,I am still reading this book. When ever I need a word of encouragement or just something to remind me of the love of God. I pick it up. This is not a replacement for the Bible. It is a good accompaniment.
1,Disappointed,"I love the purpose driven life book, and wanted to share with my 17y old niece but knew she would sit and read, I thought this would be perfect, but was disappointed, it really would just confuse her more, and doesn't really provide a devotional guide, it's just been sitting on my bookcase, i wouldn't even find use for it."
2,Scriptures only,Read the fine print of the book cover. This is not the actual book. It is only the scriptures used in the book. Disappointed to discover this after I made the purchase. My bad!
2,Error in text,"This devotional is not what I expected when I started reading it, but that is not why I am rating it low. This book is basically a bunch of Scriptures under a certain topic, which follows the Purpose Driven Life book. That wouldn't be a problem except that I found multiple errors which changed the meaning of the text. Some I looked up, and it was not even the correct verse. This is the Holy Word of God we are dealing with, and it should not be taken lightly!"
5,All the scriptures from the book in one place,This is such a handy book to use along with The Purpose Driven Life because it pretty much focuses on the scriptures (and there are plenty of them) from all the different translations that the author uses. So you don't have to keep flipping to the back of the book to see where the scriptures came from - just use this paperback along with the regular book. Works great!
2,Not so good,"I was somewhat disappointed in this addition to the original book. It was just the quotes of the scripture from the original text. If I wanted additional information of what I read , I would have looked it up myself. It, to me, was a waste of my money."
3,A bit overrated,"I received great reviews from friends about this book so I became interested myself. However, upon reading, I wondered if their praises were over generous & the book overrated? I don't want to sound too negative in reviewing this book. Maybe had I read it during a more receptive state, then, I probably would have appreciated it more. As it is, I found the introductory phase too long. The author could have simply made this shorter & proceeded with the ""purpose chapters"" immediately. What I appreciate though is the ""reflection portions"" at the end of each chapter. These do not only summarize the several-pages long chapters, but most importantly allow you to reflect & get in touch with your inner self."
3,"french gift basket, not so tipical","products are OK but the choice is not that good. being french, I would have like to have some kind of description in the basket for each product, and maybe a different choice"
2,"Great Content, Author Can't Explain Clearly Though","I bought this book to understand the mathematics and physics in A-Life and Complexity. Instead I found this book very long winded and difficult to comprehend exactly what was trying to be said. The content and layout of the book is great, just wish a better writer had been the author of this book. Lots of fancy, big words that are not needed to get the basic points across. Very hard to understand what is being said. It takes smarts and skill to explain complicated, abstract ideas in a meaningful manner. This book does not do that. I wish it did!"
3,Good bank bag,What can I say it does what it's supposed to. I don't like you can't lock it with the key out.
5,Way to go!,"everyone who enjoys good latin pop, should get this new cd! I specially recommend their single ""Duele"" and the song ""Sé""!LU has personality and quality.Paty has a unique voice! and Mario sings great too!I think, we'll be hearing a lot more of LU!I sure hope so!"
4,Bright Lights in the Big City,"We were looking for a bright lamp and since they no longer sell 500W halogen lamps, this was the next best alternative. The lamp is attractive, in a coquettish way, and the light is bright (though not as bright as the stars deep in the heart of Texas) for a non-halogen lamp. I would recommend this product."
3,"better than most, but far worse than older HPs","This calculator is better than most other calculators, as one would expect for this price. if RPN is a must, this is your choice. The keys are better than most other calculators, but far worse than what HP was capable of in the past. There are some other quality issues (for example, the rubber feet come of too easily) and it is somewhat slow by today's standards.Bottom-line: if you own(ed) any of the older HP calculators, you will be disappointed by this one. If you don't, you will probably be pleasantly surprised by it - especially if you stomached the reviews here. It is OK, but just not great. HP quit pinching pennies and revive the old production lines!"
2,they got the order wrong,"They sent the wrong calculator, then ignored my e-mail when I notified them of their error."
2,A step backwards,"I've owned a 16c for almost 20 years now and I wanted to buy a financial calculator so I turned to the 12c. Foolishly I bought the ""latest and greatest"" 12c Platinum only to find out that latest <> greatest. In fact, the feel and performance were very poor. ..."
1,"Slower than the ""Gold"" HP-12C","The HP-12C is commonly used in appraisal work; in fact, it is required for most appraisal courses. So, that's how I got started using it. Now, I have always found the ""Gold"" HP-12C functionally just fine, except that it is very slow, especially on TVM functions. I was excited to hear that HP had come out with an upgraded ""Platinum"" version. I bought it assuming it would be faster. But, I was disappointed to find out that it was, in fact, slower. You'd think HP would have their act together after all these years. Maybe some other company will come along and give us what we really need - a faster HP-12C. It would also be nice if they would add trig functions and improve it's programmability."
1,Nasty but not cheap - AVOID,"I had a 28S that survived my teenage years, high school, 7 years of uni, field work, dogs, kids, being dropped etc. it lasted almost 20 years - in contrast my 12C Platinum has been looked after and lives in a brief case - after 18 months the keys are so wonky it is no longer usable - HP cluelessly suggested buying a new one would be a solution - if this was the price of a casio, I'd get it, but only because I dig RPN! This is not like the HP of old - google around..."
2,Construction quality below expected,"I've bought one of the 12c platinum because I needed a calculator in my office. I don't do financial calculations, so probably I'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics, but I like RPN and the programmable features.Build quality is below expected: intro key responsiveness is different than other keys', the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted, so the calculator is slightly unstable.With the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece.Disappointed."
1,HP 12C Platinum - It's Junk,"I echo the disapointment of the other reviewers regarding the quality of this calculator. I am now on my second one in 3 years, and like the first one I bought, certain of the buttons have ceased to work. It's a shame, because the durability of the original 12c is legendary. IRR calculations are a lot faster but other than that, the original 12c is a far superior product."
4,Very Fast,"Ive only has this one day - purchased based on the reviews here, and made sure i received the ""good"" version! The speed in incredible, and for some exams you need any time you can get.I have an even better calculation tested between my old 12c and the new one:9.5 PMT105.85 PV1.012000 ENTER1.012020 f YTMabout 3 seconds on platinumabout 20 seconds on old'nuff said"
3,Better than what the reviews say,"The platinum isn't that bad, but I do see some quality issues. I just got mine and the metal faceplate is coming off. (The adhesive is not very strong.) The case is extremely tight and the twisting of the calculator I think is causing the faceplate to buckle.For the record, the orginial 12C is the exact same quality and form factor now. (i.e., even if you buy the brown 12C new, you will get painted on numbers, not molded ones.)"
3,Ok Orb,Repetitious electronic grooves can get a surprising amount of mileage when thoughtful programing fluctuations compliment spacey situations- at least somewhat atoning for his passed-off previous release.
3,Not very creative,"I have all of the Orb's albums, and was also hoping this would be a good addition to the library. It's much more minimalist in sound and experimentation, closer to something you'd expect from Aphex Twin. There is not as many variety and sonic textures as you would find in even Orblivion or Orbus Terrarum. It does have its good tracks, but some are just downright monotonous. If you are a massive Orb fan, though, you may only be slightly disappointed."
2,"Sadly, not like the books","Since I have immensely enjoyed the novels of Dorothy Sayers about Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane, I thought I would surely love this TV show. Unfortunately, the first one I watched was so different from the books that I could not bring myself to finish watching it. In addition, I love British lit and films; however, I had a hard time understanding the accents. It could be the (lower) quality of sound that caused the problem."
1,save your money. read the books.,"Im a huge fan of Dorothy L Sayers writing style and character creations. But this series completely fails to capture the great dialogue, word usage, and overarching themes/social commentary which make her books so great. Not only that, the choice of Ian Carmichael as L.P. Wimsey leaves everything to be desired. Its absolutely too painful to see Wimsey portrayed by a fat 60-something. The harlequin get-up and dive from the fountain in ""Murder Must Advertise"" was ludicrous. thank god they didn't even attempt the to film the cricket game which takes place in the book! read the books, you'll be glad you did!"
5,Long live British telly...,"Was always interested after I saw Lord Peter Wimsey on PBS. This is a different set of actors than the ones I saw, but they're still quite good. To be honest, most anything British is OK with us!"
3,Great idea...,I have used this model GE Radio for a year now. First it is not an easy radio to install. It requires you drill 4 holes in the bottom of a kitchen cabinet and secure the radio to the bottom of that cabinet with 4 bolts. Not a great idea for renters. It must be positioned near an outlet so the wire can be plugged in. Once it was installed and set up...it worked great. That is until the on/off switch went bad. There is a grey button you are supposed to quickly touch to turn it on and off. Great if the phone rings or if you pop into the kitchen and want to hear some tunes. Anyway..mine stopped working. At least with any kind of normal touch. If you bang the button with a spoon it goes on..eventually. Now the good part. The radio sounds great and the LED display is big and bright. The intallation keeps the radio off the counter and that is a plus. I have not used the timer feature. There are other models that come with Cassette and CD capabilities.
2,Great appliance but not reliable,"We received one of these as a gift about five years ago. It was perfect for our needs in the kitchen. But the touch button switch to turn on the radio gradually got less and less reliable until we had trouble getting it to turn on at all. The light fixture burned out 40 watt appliance bulbs on a frequent basis, perhaps four or five a year. Also, the light began to have problems staying on. It would flicker and cause interference static) with the radio. We finally removed the appliance because we were afraid of electrical fire. The appliance has only a one year warranty and our problems began after that. Despite the fact that this appliance has had its problems, we miss it terribly and want another appliance with similar features. We are not interested in the ones with CD or tape player. They take up quite a bit more space than this model."
3,"Idea = 5, Execution = 1; Still a buy, but a hassle.","We own one of these from years ago. It's such a good idea, I'm shopping here to buy another. But the other reviewers are right; It's at least a moderate hassle to install, and the engineering is primitive (string & pulleys analog tuner with no presets, tendency to drift out of tune / off station, tendency for parts to break down -- our FM died perhaps a year after installation). Still, I'm buying another one. But I sure wish somebody would finally do this idea correctly. As it is, this will probably be another go-round of buy, try, try again, pitch that one, buy another, try again . . . . I'd gladly pay double this price for one that worked right and was more reliable."
4,"Ok, but there is a better one.","This book is alright, but I needed more. I bought Access Forms and Reports, also a Dummies book, but newer and more to the point. It gave me what I needed quickly."
1,"Annoyingly written, Badly needed a better editor","This book just takes forever to tell you anything.Bitterly disappointed at how long he takes to get to the point of what he's saying and instead recaps and repeats himself. This book desperately needed an editor with a big red pen to cut out all the fluff and meaningless small talk.Why does everything (EVERYTHING) need to be (infuriatingly) called ""cool""? I wouldn't mind but I'm already 30% of the way through the book and he is still beating around the bush.This is a series ""...for dummies"" but the author seems to think that means he's writing for six year olds."
1,Of little or no use at all.,"While embarking on my first project I purchased this book in hopes that it would guide my way; Wrong! Granted, this initial foray into Access was complicated (building an enormous master parts database and a large array of tools), but the methodology of the book was little or no help at all. When I did have a specific question the book was lacking in its explanation. Luckily for me one of my co-workers was very well versed in Access. I intend to hang on to the book and keep trying as it has received some excellent reviews by persons with much more database experience than myself - perhaps it can redeem itself. If it does I will gladly print a retract."
2,200 pages too long,"Some useful information, but one must wade through endless lame jokes, cutesy asides and unwarranted insults (nerd, geek, technoweenie etc.) about the brilliant people who designed the software. It seems to revel in a pride of ignorance - way wrong for an educational book."
4,Access 2003 for Dummies,"Though I've not worked all the way through the book yet, it appears to offer what I expected. Sometimes the ""cute"" remarks that the ""For Dummies"" series seems to expect of all their authors get a bit old, but by and large the book appears to be a good reference for a first-time database writer. I previously wrote a fairly complex business database in Paradox, and so much of the information I'm looking for is ""how"" rather than ""what"" or ""why"" with respect to writing databases in Access. I've always found the ""For Dummies"" series of books a good value, and this one is no exception. I'm sure there are levels of depth that this book is going to skip over -- I've seen little reference to VBA programming, for example. Still, a person writing an application requiring those degrees of depth and security is probably not working in Access to begin with. Such a person is probably not self-taught. Nor are they likely to be affordable to a small company such as I work for."
2,Why pay when you can get it free?,"This book is poorly designed and poorly presented. It starts out by assuming you know something about Access, or about databases, and only after a few chapters addresses the needs of beginners. The author's style lacks conciseness and clarity, and at times reading this book seems to get in the way of learning. And then there are (yawn) the endless attempts at humor. A light approach to a technical subject can be fine, but when you have to wade through it to get to instructional material it's a little much. Microsoft has free on-line tutorials for Access 2003. After giving up on this book, I used them, liked them, and learned from them. And, they're FREE."
2,Mediocre introduction to Access,"The major drawbacks to this book are 1)too much ""chat"" -- non essential verbage that doesn't contribute to the understanding of Access, 2)It talks about some features that are possible but doesn't explain how to use them -- it would have been better to not even mention them as it just led to frustration on my part as a new Access user"
4,Good but not as advanced as I needed,This book is very introductory. If you need more than the basics I wouldn't suggest this book.
2,From The Two Rivers,"At first i thought it was an addition to the new book. I started WoT when I was 12, I don't see why a normal (ok, very smart) person couldn't read the normal books... Who would trade pictures and big font for the real story, not an edited addition! If you are 10 years old or younger you should read this book though, the normal books are sortov advanced and you may not understand everything."
3,Second book not on Kendal.,"I don't have any problem with the book itself. It's a good read. My problem is that the book leaves you right in the middle of the action and if you are using a Kendal, the second book in the series doesn't seem to be available. They shouldn't put out half of a book on Kendal."
5,Eye of the World is now Kid Friendly!,"I am a lover of Robert Jordan's Wheen of Time Series and have been since Eye of the World first came out. I am an avid reader and enjoy thick books because I read so quickly. I am also a 6th grade teacher and try to impart my love of reading to my students. One way I do this is to discuss, with enthusiasm all my favorite books and the reasons why I love them so. The story line of Jordan's series always catches their interest but when they see the books, they are intimidated. Now I have From the Two Rivers and To The Blight in my classroom library and my students are loving these books. For those nay sayers, Jordan's stories should be accessible to younger audiences because they are fantastic! Also, if you picked up these books expecting a prequel or sequel, you obviously weren't paying attention because they had been advertised as Eye of the World for children!"
4,A book to get lost in 2 jmeascsKeinnon,"From the Two Rivers is a GREAT book. In this book Robert Jordan uses descriptive words and realistic speech. You may think the beginning is dry, but it gets BETTER!!!Many people think splitting up The Eye of the World into two books(From the Two Rivers and To the Blight) is a money-making scheme. But trust me, I never would have dreamed of tackling an 800 paged book, like the Eye of the World.P.s If you don't like lots of detail, I'd advise you to go search for a different author. Try my 2 favorite authors, Gerald Morris(Arthurian tales) or Tamora Pierce(Fantasy,magic)"
4,Kids,"I liked all the WOT books very much, and I think it's a very good way to get kids to read. However, the age at wich these books are aimed is chosen rather stupid. I myself have read adult fantasies since I was about ten, and started WOT at 11 (first in my native language which is Dutch). I think many adult fantasies are very suitable for children of this age (with the exception of SOT and Martin) so this book is perhaps a bit redundant. But if it gets kids to read, who am I to nag?"
3,manageable size,"So... I got this book because I was out of Diana Wynne Jones books to read and it was beside her books on the shelf. I'd heard that this series was great but didn't want to carry around the huge hardcovers that you see at the library.I enjoyed the book. It took a few chapters for me to be won over but by the end, I cared about the characters and their fates. I *really* appreciated the glossary. The book became much more comprehensible for me after I discovered it. I also appreciated not having to lug a huge book around!Try David Eddings and Terry Brooks, and of course Diana Wynne Jones...they're my favs"
1,now 1/2 the book for the price of one!?!?!,I can not believe that they are taking the books and splitting them into 2. Just to make more money. The single book was about 7.99 and now the split book is 5.99 each so they are now 4 more dollars. what a rip for a very good series of books.
5,"Same Incredible story, new art, new Material","This is a new edition of ""THE EYE OF THE WORLD"" by Robert Jordan. This is NOT a new book, so don't expect it to be. What it is though, is a way to introduce younger readers to one of the most popular and well-written Fantasy series' of our time.This edition is only half of the original edition (but it's still a good couple hundred pages!). There are illustrations throughout the books, and even a new chapter not found in the original.Some people may complain about various things, but the bottom line is that this is the same incredible saga. It's the same moving tale of young people discovering a larger world, and of a boy learning he is fated to both save and destroy the world.The Wheel of Time is a saga that has captivated millions. At times it is controversial, and sometimes even a bit slow. But for the most part: nothing is like it.Try this book. If you don't like it: oh well. If you do though...you'll want them all."
2,Older WoT Readers/Fanatics Beware.,"This is not a new book containing revalations about life in The Two Rivers. It is a reprint of the first half of ""Eye of the World"" Being an RJ WoT fanatic, I buy everything remotely related to the series and I bought ""From the Two Rivers."" However I will pass on any future split-up versions of books that I already have. The so-called new proglogue was at best a ""yawn"" and the art work, which might have been the book's single redeeming factor, was, at no fault of the artist, absolutely abysmal. It was, at best, blurred and hardly worth a second glance.Buyers who buy this book to get their child interested in WoT had better beware also. I say this because unless your child is a glutton for excruciating detail (which I am) they will not read past the first few pages.On an ending note, this version of Eye of the World was published by Starscape (a Tom Doherty Associates, LLC publisher)and not by TOR. I was not overly impressed by their product."
1,Waste of money-Disappointed,"Misleading. This was published by Starscape (a Tom Doherty Associates, LLC publisher)and not by TOR (also Tom Doherty). The cover art was done by another artist (Charles Keegan), not by Darrell K. Sweet. What was most misleading about this book was the lable on the front of the book that says ""A New Prologue by the Author"". The book does have a pre-prologue that I have not read before, called ""Earlier-Ravens"". It is a 12 page depiction of Egwene (as a child) carrying water at Bel Tine in the spring during sheep shearing. I usually get my hands on everything I can that was written for the WOT series and I don't remember running across this bit of info. It was not worth buying the book for this pre-prologue."
3,More Difficult than Five Golden Rules,"&#65279;The prospective reader is warned that this book requires considerably more mathematical background than Five Golden Rules, a fact that is not made clear on the book jacket nor in the nonexistent forward or table of contents. In addition, Casti seems to have found it necessary to leave many more points incompletely explained than in Five Golden Rules; though perhaps this was unavoidable given the more difficult subject matter. I am puzzled about what audience Casti thought would read the book."
2,Where is the value added?,"In this book, John Casti takes an academic's eye toward 5 interesting areas of mathematics. Unfortunately, his treatment of the material reminds me of sitting in all too many classrooms in graduate school, with a professor rambling and scribbling on the board without ever bothering to indicate why it even mattered. Like all too many of my professors, he leaves the truly interesting material (the impact) to the reader's imagination. Casti really missed the mark here. He had the opportunity not just to present mathematical proofs, but to show why this is really interesting stuff. Instead, the material is presented no differently than how it would appear in a graduate level textbook. So, why not stick with those graduate level textbooks? Where is his value added as an author?"
3,Not what is pictured,"I'm a little irritated that the towel I received is not the same as the one pictured. I specifically wanted a waffled towel like those shown, but the one that came has a flat, stiff surface that is more slippery when dry than the waffled dish towel I had experimented with. It is also a lot brighter than the photos, with a single, day glow orange border, rather than the muted 2 toned one pictured. It definitely looks cheeper than I expected.However, color, texture, and aesthetics aside, it did work relatively well in my hot yoga class. I kept it off my mat for the first part of the class, because even when I patted it down with drinking water it was still slippery. Eventually, though, once I began to warm up, it began to do its job, and I was confident enough with its sticking power to use it under my hands in wheel. Because of that I will keep it until I can find a waffled version of the same thing."
1,not skidless,"This towel actually made my mat more slippery. And to make matters worse, the manufacturer won't accept returns."
1,Not worth it,"For $20, the towel part could be a bit thicker. it's good as a base on the mat for the real towel i use while my hands sweat but other than that, you're better off using a regular towel. I am disappointed."
5,A great product!,"I usually use a normal hand sized towel on my mat during hot yoga but it bunches and isn't the most reliable. This towel, however, does the exact opposite. It stays in place the entire time (even as I sweat buckets on it!) so I don't have to worry about my hands slipping from my sweaty mat. A great buy!"
4,Nice Size,"I have the regular size towel, also in white, and combine it with the smaller towel which I use for my face. And I am very tall so this gives me extra length. Surprisingly it mops up a lot of sweat in hot yoga. I did end up buying more of these grippy towels in the beautiful green/blue tie died color because the white shows every mark."
4,yoguitoes yoga towel,"It does help to avoid slipping a little, but not 100%. The texture of the side that goes upwards could be thicker to help resistance."
1,This case is bad news,"Even if it were not poorly stitched and made with shockingly flimsy nylon, the case is way too small to fit most modern dulcimers. Avoid."
2,Low-Quality and ill-Fitting,"I received this case to carry my new Christmas present, a Tennessee Mountain dulcimer. Not only was this case much to small to accomodate the instrument, it seemed cheaply made. The case would not protect an instrument from ANYTHING, except perhaps a light drizzle. Invest in a better case for your treasured instrument rather than subject it to the elements in this dreadful carrier."
4,Anyone Ever Heard of the group Da Buzz....?,"Because evidently DJ Encore has. Every single song sounds like it is off of a ""Da Buzz"" album. The new vocalist sounds EXACTLY like Annika from ""Da Buzz."" You can actually sing the words to some of their songs to the music of the new DJ Encore disc. Not that this is a bad thing, because ""Da Buzz"" is one of the greatest dance-pop groups ever assembled, and I think DJ Encore may be a fan. To his credit, he has come up with a set of beats that are a little more modern than the last record, but the first reviewer was correct, too many ballads here. If you love this disc, check out the album ""Alive"" by Da Buzz. It is better than anything that even the ethereal Madonna has ever released. As for DJ Encore, he has mad talent, and should not wait five years to share it with us again."
2,disappointing!,"well, theres like 3 or 4 actual dance songs on here. The rest of the album consists of slow songs, and really lame power dance ballads (which kinda sounds like cher's modern music). I hate when DJ'S put out an excellent 1st record, and completely change musical directions with there follow ups. This is a perfect example of this."
4,He's finally back,"I was just as disappointed as anyone else that Engelina is not singing on the new CD, but I'm glad I gave this one a chance. It may not be ""Intuition"" but it's still very good."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz...,"Boring. After the first three or four marginal songs, the rest of the tracks get even more boring. The lyrics are uninspiring and seem designed to rhyme as little as possible. There are few good danceable tracks here that get your heart moving like there were in the first CD. If you like electronic dance, I would recommend the first album by DJ Encore, but not this one."
1,Didnt notice a thing,I tried this product for stress and general calmness and honestly I didn't notice anything at all. I varied the dosages but it didn't seem to do anything. I am going to try some 5htp next.
1,Purchased & used this item in May; didn't feel any difference,"Maybe it's different for everyone, but this product didn't have any noticeable effect when I took it. Hopefully, I'm the exception & others here get better results...good luck"
3,I don't know if it's helping or not.,My sons doctor ordered this for him to be taken 1 capsule once daily for his anxiety related to autism. I'm just not seeing anything standing out to me that it's helping in any way. We are about halfway through the bottle.Update: Dr. raised the dose to 2 capsules a day. We are on our 1st week...i think i notice now and then that he is calmer but im sure it would take a bit longer to take full effect. I will be back with another update soon.
2,ineffective,"as with so many such products, the benefits are illusory; it did not appear at all effective for its purpose"
4,Excellent Relaxation Supplement,"Ever since I first purchased this product and started taking it daily, I've felt an overwhelming sense of well-being and a welcomed calmness in my daily activities. I've also noticed that my thinking and decision making seems to be easier and with less effort. I would recommend this product for all of the natural benefits that come from taking it. In my opinion, ordering the powder is MUCH more economical especially for me because the dosage that I found works best for me is around 400mg which would be 4 pills gone per day. But if ease of use is what your looking for than capsules are good too. Either way, if your in need of a natural stress reliever then get L-theanine - it works!"
3,Capsules are only 100mg each,"Three stars because the product (as advertised on Amazon) does not specify the strength of the capsules. I purchased them expecting them to be 200mg each, but found that they were only 100mg capsules upon receiving the product."
4,Relief from delusional thinking,This is one product that I can honestly say I wish I had known about 20 years ago. It is hands down by far more superior to any anti depressant without the side effects. My only two criticisms are price and half life. Great supplement.
4,Has helped with stress and anxiety,"This product has helped me to handle chronic stress and anxiety with none of the side effects of Xanax and other prescription drugs. It is hard to describe the effect other than to say it makes me feel very calm yet alert. It's something I have been searching for for years. I am one of those people who will get even the most obscure or rare side effect from a medication or a supplement, but I have not experienced anything unpleasant since I have been taking this. I am taking two to three 200 mg capsules per day. Usually I take one in the morning and one at lunch. If it's an especially crazy day, I will take a third in the evening. I don't know if the L-Theanine is responsible for this, but I am also tasting the flavor of foods much more intensely and it does seem to coincide with beginning to take this product. I wish I had known about L-theanine years ago when I was suffering from severe panic attacks an PTSD."
4,Good but wish this brand had 200MG,"L-Theanine works great for my stress and panic issues. I do find that I have to take it regularly to work, not just when ""its coming"". I have noticed that if I am full on stressed or panicking, then it is too late. I need to use it as a preventative more than a fix.I would give this brand 5 stars if they had a 200MG variant. Unfortunately, 200MG works for me. So I take 2, 3 times a day."
4,Takes the Edge Off,"I was experiencing some anxiety and did not want to get on powerful medication. I gave Suntheanine a try and it works for me. Like all other substances it will vary from person to person but for me it has a subtle way of taking the edge off and helping me to pause and breath before jumping into action. I have experienced no side effects, in fact I no longer notice that it does anything but I am not needlessly anxious and I do sleep a bit sounder."
2,Not Very Impressed,"I decided to try this to see if I could find a natural alternative to Xanax, as I seem to have ADHD as well as OCD, with a bit of GAD thrown in. I constantly worry, my head is always scatterbrained, and I get stressed out easily from my job (computer technician) and we also have a new puppy at home. I thought that this would help me relax and be more at ease, but it doesn't really appear to do much for me. I still have this nagging feeling of tightness in my back that I get when I have anxiety attacks or I am worrying over nothing, and I still feel stressed out. I did notice for a day or so that when I took two before bed time that I wasn't waking up at 3am, 4am, etc. It didn't work for long though, and I have been waking up at similar times during the night once again. I think if you are looking for something a little stronger, to try going with GABA. I am going to try that next before I seek professional help."
1,Don't buy this heater,"I had about the same experience as a previous poster. I received the heater, opened the box and the heater was filthy. It was covered with dirt and fingerprints and looked like it was used for a year. But since I paid so much for shipping I decided to at least give it a try and was very disappointed. It say's you can adjust the temperature to whatever temp you want (up to 85 degrees). I bought it to put under my desk at work because it is so cold in my office. I get cold very easily and I sit right under the office air conditioner, so I set it to the highest temp, 85. It wouldn't go past 72 degrees which is the temperature of the office and the fan just shut off. When I tried adjusting it again, nothing happened. I couldn't adjust the temp up or down, or even shut it off completely (the manual say's you can shut it off by holding the mode button for 2 seconds). The only way to change the temp was to unplug it for 10 minutes. I am sending this back today."
4,Works well and very quietly,"Have used several of these as bedroom heaters. The house we live in doesn't do a good job of heating the bedrooms evenly when the doors are closed, so we use these in the winter to warm up the colder rooms. They're worked really well. Thermostat controls the temperature very well, and there's a safety mechanism that shuts the heater off if it's knocked over. A great buy."
2,"Arrived in Poor, Possibly Reconditioned Condition","The retail box for this heater arrived with a giant gash in the side and a damaged corner; the shipping box is in perfect condition, so it wasn't damaged on the way here. I can overlook that, but the heater itself is completely filthy - covered in a thick layer of dirt, dust, and fingerprints, like it's been sitting in somebody's woodshop for a couple weeks. Also, some of the screws look stripped, which in addition to the above makes me wonder if this isn't ""reconditioned"" being passed off as ""new"". I haven't used the heater yet, but I wanted to warn others considering buying this... you might be getting a used heater.*EDIT*: The heater worked for about two weeks, then it began to shut itself down after a couple minutes of use."
2,Authors' mean spirited commentary hurts otherwise great book,To read the story of Eaton's is to read the history of Canada and Toronto in particular. What starts off as a well-researched and interesting story is increasingly hurt by the authors' obvious dislike of the family. (Whom he admits in the prologue did not want the book written) Still the book was interesting and filled with titbits that Canadians in particular will enjoy learning. The authors' synopsis that Eaton's failed because the family never took to the time to really understand retail could also have been applied to his own attempt to chronicle a business he never seems to have a grasp on.
3,An Honest Effort,"It's nice to hear a kinder, gentler Holly Near. Over the past few years, she's conquered live theatre and and cabaret, as well as contributed to S.T.A.G.E. in addition to her prior political work. This disc is a natural progression for Holly, based on her evolution as an artist. And, to record this with her long-time accompanist, John Bucchino, is perfect. Holly & John work well together, and Holly sounds as if she wants these songs to be a gift. But, she doesn't always sound comfortable with the song choices. Yet, it is the true measure of an artist to be able to perform with limited instrumentation, as she does here with simply piano -- at that Holly excels. One would wonder why she doesn't wrap her vocal chops around the songwriting of her friend and accompanist, John Bucchino -- now that would be an excellent match of vocalist and lyricist."
4,So nice to come home to,"Holly Near's singing voice has a unique timbre; it's quite beautiful and perfectly matched to this type of material. I looked forward to the CD, remembering well the standards medley from her ""Lifeline"" album. Near doesn't disappoint in this great set, where she is matched with longtime musical collaborator John Bucchino on piano. (I remember seeing the two of them in concert in 1986.) From Near's liner notes, it looks like the recording process took place in three days. If they had a little more time together, I think this would have been a five-star set, but who cares? Perfection is in the eye of the beholder, and Holly Near singing standards is close to perfection."
1,JUST NOT HER VENUE,"The collection of songs is wonderful...the simple accompaniment perfect...but the voice is way too thin and occasonally grating to do the work justice. As much as I admire and respect John Bucchino as a songwriter and musician, I'm surprised that he wouldn't choose a performer that better matches the music...or choose music that better suits this mediocre performer."
4,From dumber to dumb....,"Did not have a clue on power point but with the help of a presentation already in place and the tips from this book, I was able to pull it off."
5,"An Easy Tutorial for ""Dummies"" Like Me!","Being not so computer savvy, I needed to learn how to use PowerPoint quickly. I bought the book and found it very easy to understand and learn. I've mastered the use of PowerPoint and keep the book as a reference if needed in the future. I rate it A+++ and would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn and master PowerPoint."
5,what can be said its wounderful music,"iam not a authority on great music ,but when i was little you would hear this type of music all the time from the people of the old country,and it brings back fond memories.it was delevered quickly"
5,"Fast paced action, interesting characters, quick read","Hats off to Michael Bracken for a well-done story. Uncluttered language, fast paced action, interesting characters make for a fast read. The protagoinist, Big Dick is a caring, tough unlicensed private eye seeking a missing young woman. His seedy turf: adult book stores, strip clubs brings him in contact with pedophiles, pimps and pornographers. Among his friends are two reformed prostitutes. Big Dick renews a love interest with one, now a librarian, proving that people can change.Can he trust his former partner, a police lieutenant and other menhe knows on the strip? An interesting conclusion."
5,This Book Provided A Fort Of Protection!,"There's no doubt that this book is going to help my company become very powerful with lots of protection. The kind of protection that would cost thousands from legal council.Wealth can take years to achieve but minutes to lose. Thanksto the author for sharing such incredible valuable informationthat will maximize corporate profits while limiting loses. I truly feel that I now have a true fort around my business.This book should be a required reading for any BUSINESS OWNERespecially if they want MAXIMUM ASSET PROTECTION-THUMBS UP!!DeWayne Johnson-MBA-Palm Springs,CA."
4,Great for beginners,"If you did not take a business class in college, this book is great to teach you the basics. It teaches everything from scratch and tells you how to get the additional information you need. There are other books out there that also come with a CD with the forms you need. This book does not have these application forms, but these keep changing anyway so you have to get them from the state website you apply to."
5,Excellent Advice,Excellent Advice about what is happening in the U.S. today. People need to put this into practice.
1,I wish people would wake UP and think for themselves....,"I agree with the people who say this man is a fake. Think about it, if God gave you a revelation that all Christian's would need to hear, do you think The Lord would give the information to someone who would write a book and make millions of dollars on it? NO if it is genuine you would do as Christ did, Teaching and giving the information for free to anyone who would listen. I emailed him and pointed that out and the email I got back from his staff was anything but Christian. I was shocked!Beware!! There are many false prophets out there and he is one of them!!In Christ's Love"
3,Book is online in PDF,"For anyone who is interested, the book is on line at Rev. Wilkerson's daily weblog in PDF format. The Print function on the PDF is disabled, as is also the highlight/copy/paste function. The book has many interesting facts which people of these later generations may not appreciate, such as just how promiscuous people were encouraged to be even back at the beginning of the 1900's."
4,A Must Read,David Wilkerson's insight is amazing for the time it was written. I found this book very comforting in lieu of what is going on in the world today and the uncertainty of the upcoming future. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is frightened or concerned about their future or world events!
5,Henry Ruffner My Great Uncle,The book is beautifully written and at the time Ruffnerwas President of Washington College now Washington andLee University. The book was considered to be one of thefirst publications to deal with antisemitism. Ruffnersother writings on religion are profound.
1,Unless you like flushing your money...,"...Run. This was a total rip off, take terrible pictures. In addition, the install software tries to install adware / spyware on your computer. If you have $100 or so to spend, go buy a REAL digital cam, this piece of CRAP isn't it."
4,"Sure, it's not *exactly* like the photo","I had read the other reviews but decided to purchase this desktop mic stand anyway. It is to be used with an Audio Technica (AT2020) mic, and a Sampson (SP01) shockmount. I have also attached a clamp on pop filter. Everything fits both secure and stable. The base is weighted heavily enough to support all the gear it's holding. My only complaint, and it's not much is that the mast could stand to be about 2 or 3 inches taller... But that would require an even heavier base. Overall, it is certainly the best value for a desktop stand."
1,Don't Buy this,THEY SENT ME A MIC STAND WITH MISSING PIECES. I RETURNED THIS INSTANTLY. ITS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD A BAD TIME WHEN PURCHASING SOMETHING ONLINE. JUST HORRIBLE. THE PACKAGE WAS ALREADY OPENED. THE MIC ONLY NEEDED 3 PIECES THE THE MAIN CONNECTOR PIECE WAS MISSING. I WILL NEVER TRUST THIS BUYER AGAIN. AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU.
1,Runaround,Ordered 5 items but this one did not arrive. Said wrong address but all others came. Lost $5.00 in shipping sounds like a run-around.
1,This Isn't Even The Same Product as the Picture!,"Hey guys -I bought this mike stand despite the previous reviewer's note that it has the wrong thread size. Well, that's one thing, but the mike stand I just received *isn't even the same product* as the one in the picture. Amazon says this stand has a 4"" base. My tape measure says it's 5 1/2"". The picture has little knobs visible as feet; my stand has no such knobs. The photo has a 5/8"" to 3/8"" transfer with a double nut (as mentioned before by the other reviewer). Mine has bare 5/8"" screws (male) at the top.I will be visiting an Ace Hardware to try to find the part that is depicted and should have been included with this product. In the mean time, DO NOT BUY THIS MIKE STAND. There's another one that costs only a bit more on here and it appears to have the correct parts based on the comments. ""Music People,"" you owe me that nut on the top of the pictured stand so I can at least use this product!"
2,Picture is MISLEADING!,"The picture showing the On-Stage DS7100 Desktop Microphone Stand topped by a threaded 5/8F to 3/8M adapter is MISLEADING: this item actually comes WITHOUT THE ADAPTOR, but with a standard 5/8M thread only!I ordered 5 of those stands and now I have to order 5 adaptors separately ($3.50 each)! Not to mention paying shipping costs twice for nothing...Music People DS7100 B On Stage DS7100 Desktop Microphone Stand (Black)"
2,Not as shown in picture,"Unfortunately you do not get what is pictured here. Instead of a small screw with a holding washer as shown, the item arrives with a standard black pipe with threads on both ends. This will work fine if you already have a microphone clamp designed to screw onto a standard stand, but if you want this for your camera or a digital recorder, this stand will not work."
2,"Dirt cheap, with matching quality control and description","Stand came with a bent tube, and did not come with the adapter shown in the picture. It is dirt cheap though..."
4,"Works fine, but too low for a shock mounted mic","This stand works fine if you don't need a shock mount. The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations. I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2-A mic on a shock mount. The low height (4 1/2"") - which would otherwise help stabilize the mic - left too little clearance between the mic and desktop. If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic, you're better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, Black.BTW, my copy of this stand also did not have the 3/8 inch male thread."
3,Bboy = BREAK BOY,"Bboy means Break Boy, a bboy is a breakdancer, not an MC or a DJ or Graffiti Technican or a BASKETBALL Player. You're not a bboy unless you throw down on the floor and dance, and your not a bboy unless you battle. There are 55 pages of the Bboy section, mostly written on Rap artists. Which is cool because they are a part of bboy history too, but they are rappers not bboys. Other than that, the rest of the book is great, I would recommend reading this book for the sake of good history. But for Bboy history, I would read a different one, or just buy the Freshest Kids DVD. I did buy the book mostly for a different view on HIpHOp History and that i was referred to read it.All and all he is a good writer.Bboy StepChild"
2,I'm croaking,"While I love nature sounds especially frogs, I found this to be a very monotonous high pitched collection of frog sounds. It never changed just went on and on. This is not my favorite frog sounds CD."
3,Problem with block,"I apologize for posting this here. This is not a criticism of the seller. I received mine today and I was so excited to use it with my grandson. Unfortunately, two of the sides (dog and cow) don't work. I checked the Amazon return policy and they say that, in order to return it I have to have it in unopened condition. I didn't know that all sides of the cube didn't play until I got it out of the packaging and could access all sides. Please advise what I need to do to exchange it."
3,Cute,We purchased this for our granddaughter. Thought it was so cute and that she would love. Unfortunately not so much. Maybe she was too old for it. She is now 17 months.
1,A Piece Of Crap,I didn't expect miracles but I spent almost fifty bucks on this and it doesn't help at all. It would ease pain more sitting on a piece of plywood! I am really disappointed in this item! I purchased it at Amazon and am disappointed in Amazon for offering an item that is useless!
1,Terrible,How come this product is still for sale. It is no help at all. There are much better products. Would return it if it weren't more expensive to ship it back.
3,Comfortable but not firm,"Got this cushion because I needed something firm to sit on post-surgery. I'm a big guy (200 lbs or so) and as soon as I sat on it, the cushion did not hold up. More comfortable than without it but did not do the trick."
1,too hard and uncomfortable,"I ordered the extra firm as recommended for those over 200 lbs. At least for a woman, its just too uncomfortable to sit on. With shipping and taxes $57.00 for this is way overpriced, worth about 20.00. Its no better than the ones you can buy at your local medical supply store"
2,Too firm,"Too firm. Ridges cutting into my legs, cutting off blood circulation in legs. Made my own out of a couple of cheap cushion seats. Worked better and without any pain."
3,The Jury is Out,"If this is the Large cushion, I'd hate to see what the regular size looks like. It definitely isn't the size stated. It's barely 13"" from top to bottom and barely 16"" from side to side. I'll try it and see if it works, but right now, I am doubtful."
5,Excelent Product!,"This cushion is definitly worth a try if you have tailbone pain when sitting. i bought one for my Mom for Christmas and ever since, she has not mentioned pain when sitting at her computer or trying to stand from a sitting position. She has said a few times that she loves it and that it has taken the pain away. I tried it myself and found it very comfortable."
5,Large FIRM Tush Cush Seat Cushion - Navy Blue,"I'm a truck driver and this Tush Cushion works excellent! And it's rugged! I slide around on it, twist and turn on it, and it still looks and works like new!"
3,Good product but prefer the sacro ease wedge more,"This product was as described, however I found it a bit too large, too firm and the sacral cutout was also too large and uncomfortable for me. Although I did order this in a firm and large size, I didn't realize how firm it would be and that the size of the cut out was over 3 inches wide. I decided to return this and ordered a ""sacral ease wedge ease"" by McCarty instead, which I would rate 5/5 stars. The latter feels more like true memory foam with just enough give and the sacral cut out is optional. You just have to remove it. I have a herniated disc without any sacral pain so I'm leaving the cut out in, but it's nice to know it's an option. Although the sacral ease cost about $20.00 more than the tush cush I feel it's worth it. The tush cush overall is a good product, but I am glad I exchanged it for the ""sacral ease wedge ease"" which relieves my pain more effectively, especially while driving."
3,be advised,"I have been using this cushion for about a month - it is definitely firm. Product-wise it is good quality and worth it's price. I've rated it only three stars for the fact that it isn't quite right for me. It is twice as firm as the ""regular"" one. I weigh around 210 lbs and it is too firm for me. It would be ok for gymnasium bleachers or hard folding chairs, but I don't go to these places. I advise that only people over 225 lbs will realize the comfort of the firm cushion - otherwise just get the regular one."
2,TOO big,I am a big woman (my wife is writing this one) but this cushion was even huge for me. The hole for your tail bone is so big you sink into it and thus defeats the whole purpose of the cushion. It seems like it is really padded nice but only you can be the judge if need something this big.
1,Worthless!,"If you are on the heavy side, don't buy this! For normal weight people this probably will work okay but if you're over a hundred pounds overweight pass on this...it just flattens and you still hurt to sit down for long."
5,Saved me!,"I had a horrible bout of backbone problems. When I knew I would be sitting for an extended amount of time, I bought this pillow and it helped a lot."
3,"Okay, but doesn't eliminate discomfort on long car trips ...","I bought this cushion to help alleviate soreness I feel in my butt during 2+ hour car trips. The cushion is more comfortable than a regular seat, but the long car trips still cause discomfort for me. The cushion is about 2-3 inches thick, so it elevates you quite a bit. If you use in the car and you have big legs, it may cause your thighs to hit the bottom of the steering wheel."
5,TushCush,"This product is great. I drive a delivery van about 250 miles 3 days a week. The Tush Cush made for a more comfortable ride, and my back was not nearly as tired at the end of the day. I would recommend this product to anyone that does much traveling, or drives for a living."
3,Tush cushion review,"I returned the cushion because it wasn't firm enough. The concept is good to relieve stress from your tailbone area, but the foam wasn't firm enough for me to do the job adequately. The product arrived quickly which is a plus; however, when I returned it I was charged a $15 restocking fee. That seems a bit much given that this item is only packaged in a plastic bag that was still in as new condition when I returned it. Perhaps, it's the CEO's job to restock this item and therefore CEO restocking wages are being employed. One other note, I am 6'2'' tall and the cushion was a little short to fully support my lower thighs. It felt like sitting on a chair that was a bit too short."
2,Too Firm,"The packaging this cushion came in had it labled ""Extra Firm"" and it was all that. I am 5'11"" and weigh 160 lbs. and found it to be uncomfortably hard. So much so that the front of the u-shaped cut-out caused discomfort. The product was well made but I need a cushion that is more comfortable, yet still keeps me elevated from the chair or seat."
3,"Just not good enought for me,,,,, :(","Needed a good cushion for my computer chair. This was not it. Just not thick and soft enough for me. Instead I took a twin foam bed topper and folded it until it fit into my chair. PERFECT !!!! Now I can sit in comfort at my computer. Yay !!!!! So what did I do with this Tush Cushion I had bought ???? Glad u asked. It's on another chair that I use at the dinning room table. Does fine there. So there you go,,,,, the mystery of my Tush Cush Seat Cushion has been solved.... ;)"
2,Cushion?,"Way too firm. . We bought the cushion to make his computer chair more comfortable but after my 200 lb husband sat on it 15 minutes his legs were getting numb. The return process was easy and simple, and the refund was prompt."
3,Good Product. Bad Price.,"So, other than the fact that this cushion is overpriced by roughly 40 dollars, I can honestly say that it is a good product. I will rate the product alone. If you are not too heavy, this cushion takes some pressure off of your tailbone. Even though the cushion claims to be firm, it is not. If you are 200 lbs, get an extra-firm cushion. This one is useful for everybody under 180-190. If you are heavier, it will help, but nowhere near as much as you need it to if you have a tailbone injury, for example. But it is well-made. The cushion does not bend out of shape. The cover does not bunch up or tear easily or stretch out. A good buy if you can spare the cash."
3,So SO,This cushion is indeed firm and it does have a cover that can beremoved and washed. I haven't washed mine yet so I hope it does notshrink. It is a little wide as it does not fit well on standardfolding chairs. It is quite expensive compared to others and I don't believe thatthere is anything about it to justify the high price. I would not buy this again.
3,It's Ok,It does not make miracles!!!Your pain wont go away because you have this.it will decrease a little bit.But it worth's a try!!!
3,It is what it says.,"The description is very accurate. It is a FIRM in all caps ""cushion."" I am not the lightest, about 215 lbs, and this cushion was too firm for me. My chair has about 1.5 years on it and the seat is a little worn. This did little to remedy the firmness my chair was providing. I would personally look for a softer cushion, but if super firm cushions are your thing this will definitely deliver"
2,this thing don't work!,"it is too expensive, it is too hard , it dose not help you lower back. it's uncomfortable . it's too big. it's waste of money!"
5,Perfection,"I thank everyone who took the time to review numerous ""tush cush-like"" products, as well as this one. My tailbone has hurt for nearly four years. Let's skip the drama. This cushion is properly firm, comfortable, durable, light weight, highly portable, and is well worth its very reasonable price for the value. I have owned it 2-3 months and it has helped alleviate pain noticeably (and remains in mint condition). And, the slight incline allows the low back to relax. Four people I know have purchased this pillow based on my experience and they are equally pleased, and they were not in pain, it just made sitting - at home, in the car, at work - so much more comfortable. Treat yourself to deserved comfort. Enjoy."
4,Truly Firm,"This cushion takes awhile to get used to. When described as being firm, they are correct. It does take the pressure off the back which is good as it relieves back problems when sitting. Since it is slanted forward, it also seems to impove posture. I rated it a 4 because it is a little too firm."
4,Helped when nothing else would,"I have had cocyx pain for almost a year and after not being able to stand it any longer I went to physical theraphy. That helped some but learning how to sit & what to sit on helped more. I tried 3 other cushions before I found this one & I am about to buy another one for my desk chair. It does not compress as much as other ones did but I bought the firm not the regular one even though it is recommended for people over 200 lbs. (I am 150) I also found it helps to have a lumbar cushion to support your back since this cushion does help you remember to have ""better posture""."
4,Fine Product That Could Be Improved,"This is an excellent product. It maintains its firmness and shape, and with extended use in both my car and wheelchair seats shows no signs of compression. Rear cutout & carrying handle are also excellent comfort features. It is not as deep front-to-back as it could be which distracts somewhat from overall comfort. The cushion would also benefit from a base fabric to keep it from sliding as I transfer on and off either my wheelchair or car seat. The cushion works very well for my wife's comfort & posture in her office chair. She now uses it on a daily basis, and also wants to try it on her car seat during our next trip."
5,Nice cushion!,"I bought this cushion to help my siatica when driving. So comfortable, I take it with me to sir on any time I'm going to be sitting for awhile. Had for a month now-very satisfied."
5,Large Firm Tush Cush,This cushion is great because I have a bulging disc and it helps to take the pressure off my back and keep my posture while seated.
2,poor design,Cushion is very firm. It supports my 215 lbs very well. However the edges around the cut out are very rigid and firm. Makes my buttocks very sore where it contacts the edges. This could have been eliminated by beveling the edges. This is a design flaw that shouldn't be. I can't recommend this product.
4,Firm Tush Cush,This cushion works very well and is a good size for a large rear end. The handle is handy. Although it is firm it is very comfortable.
5,Perfect!,"I couldn't be more pleased with this cushion. It is very firm, holds up well under my considerable weight and provides the relief that I need."
4,Firm,A little too firm but nice! I got this for my desk chair and it provides a good boost and keeps my back straight :)
1,"Too small, moves too much",It's not comfortable. It moves too easily. It's too small. It is overpriced. Save your money and buy a good boat cushion. They are more comfortable.
1,ABOLUTE RIP OFF | MORE PAIN WITH THE SEAT | DO NOT PURCHASE,"For starters, this product does not work PERIOD. I bought it to use at my home office, and a recent trip about 500 miles. It actually caused more pain than using the actual seat. I really can not say enought that you purchase anything but this item. It is definatly not worth anything. Can't return the product without steep return & shipping fees. A complete rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Lino Borges-""El Romantico de Cuba""","The re-issuer of this great recording in Colombia, did a wonderful job and does honor to Lino's memory, who passed away in his native town in Habana, Cuba in 2003. This is a beautiful CD and its sound its just brilliant with an amazing repertoire. Not to be missed, a must buy."
3,"All The Hits, and then some...","Bill Withers has penned some memorable music to be sure, and it's all here on ""Lovely Day."" Unfortunately they didn't stop there. They rounded the album out with lesser-known songs, and it turns out, they're lesser known for a reason. I found myself skipping many of the slower tracks out of boredom. Sometimes less is more. I love Bill's ""Live at Carnegie Hall."" It has all the hits, with the exception of ""Just The Two Of Us,"" but without all the mundane filler. ""Live..."" is all the Bill Withers you need. Skip this collection of ""hits"" and go for the live album instead. You'll be glad you did."
3,good for the price,"we bought this for $20, it will probably be cheaper after the season is over. it has a pretty wimpy fan and the fact that it will continue to run even though the heat cycle is turned off is more of a problem than a feature for me. It does adequately heat a small room, or corner of a large room, and is pretty quiet. Of course here in the South, it only has to heat the room from 60 to 70 or so, so its not really challenged. I would still go with an oil filled radiator to seriously heat a challenged room (we use on in our sons bedroom)"
1,Should have listened to the other reviews,"Despite the warnings on the other reviews I purchased this product because of the DeLonghi reputation and it had all the features I was looking for. Once I opened the box and tried it the unit did not work at all. No fan, no heat it would only oscillate. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy as I sent it right back less than 24 hours of having it in my possession."
1,splurge for a better space heater,"I never actually got the space heater to work properly. When I took the space heater out of the box, I plugged it into the wall outlet and turned it on, expecting that it would start-up like most other space heaters. This one did not. I read the directions to make sure I was doing everything properly, which I was, but it still would not work. Eventually, the rotating part of the heater started working, but still no heat or fan. I sent it back since it seemed like if the machine wasn't going to work the first time I used it, I shouldn't count on it for the long run."
3,"Works well, once you figure out how...","We almost sent this product back. The timer on it makes initial operation tricky, and several people after looking at it decided that it didn't work. We even read the directions, but they didn't really offer much guidance.After we got past that obstacle, it was fine."
5,Great Space Heater for Baby,"We purchased this space heater for my daughter's room, we don't have central heat and it gets pretty cold in there overnight. I bought this model because of the timer, the fact that there is no fuel, and the tip-over safety. If the unit tips over or is put down on top of it's cord, it will not turn on. And of course the price.It's a great heater for the price. The timer is very, very simple and works. The unit puts out a lot of heat, so we only use it for 30 minutes every two-three hours. It warms her room perfectly. This heater also rotates, spreading the heat around the room. I feel like my daughter is safe and warm."
4,Works great,"I really like the thermostat on this space heater. I use this in my baby's room at night, as we live in the mountains, cold. It works really well and pops on when needed. The only thing I'm not sure of yet is if it is really affecting my power bill, I'll know after this month."
4,DeLonghi Heat Fan Heater,Cute heater fan. Instructions should be more specific as had a very hard time to get heater working. Finally got it working after an hour of figuring it out how to do it. Thought it didn't work like the last one I did an exchange for.
2,Space Heater,The heater does not give off the heat I thought it would. You have to be sitting right next to it to really get any warmth from it. It does not have an element that radiates heat so there isn't a lot of heat for the fan to send out. I would honestly recommend spending a little more and going for a larger unit. I did like the on and off timer feature though and the fact that it turns off if knocked over.
1,NO GO,returned 2 units as they both only rotated. neither the heat or the fan worked. Don't waste your time.
