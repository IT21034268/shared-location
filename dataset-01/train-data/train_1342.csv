5,Make my computer faster,Shipped on time and everything works very well. It make my computer much more faster. I like it very much!!
2,"natural brown filters, not as good as the white","We used the white Melitta cone filters for years, until our supermarket suddenly stopped carrying all No. 6 Melitta cone filters. Then we bought these natural brown ones on-line, because it's the only way we could get them, and we thought they'd be as good as the white. Well, they're not. These natural brown filters just aren't as sturdy, so they often break. The only way around it for us is to simply double up and use two filters every time. Of course, that means we're paying twice as much for filters."
4,The only ones we would buy,"These are the only #6 paper filters we would consider buying for our Melitta 10-cup cone filter coffeemaker. We have never had a defective filter among the thousands we've used over the years. However, the carton of a dozen 40-filter packages we bought in July 2011 was almost 50% more expensive than the same product in May 2010 ($28.52 vs. 19.18). It's hard to account for such a large price increase. Buying this product through Amazon, while still cheaper than elsewhere, is no longer the bargain it used to be. The 10-cup cone filter coffeemaker itself is still available through Amazon at a terrific price (less than $10)."
5,"Reliable, consistent good coffee!","I am continually pleased with the elegant, simple, effective design of the Melitta system. And it's great to be able to get the unbleached filters. The Melitta system is easy, and it delivers consistently good coffee. You can make a cup or make a pot. These are the large filters for making a pot. Great product!"
5,The Only Coffee Filter We Use,"These are the only coffee filters we use, but the #6 Melitta coffee filters - Natural - are difficult to find in stores. This is our second order through Amazon -- fast delivery and great price!"
5,Quality Beans + Filtered Cone + Thermos = Excellent Coffee Experience,"A quick, simple quality coffee-making method: While fresh cold water in the copper (fastest) pot is heating up, defrost & grind your favorite beans. Pour the HOT water over the beans in the filtered cone, resting over a thermos. Settle into a comfy chair with your feet up & a newspaper or good book. YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO GET UP ONCE UNTIL THE THERMOS IS EMPTY! HEAVEN ON EARTH!! P.S. I have tried many electric coffee makers over the years, but have been disappointed in their performance. Let's hear it for low-tech, simple and ""green""!!"
5,No. 6 Melitta Coffee Filter,"The No. 6 size coffee filter can be very difficult to find; the No. 4 size is much more common. I was pleased to discover the large selection of coffe filters through Amazon, including my size, No.6, in brown unbleached paper. Melitta is also a reliable brand. The quantity avaiable (40/package x 12 packages = 480 filters) will last for years, but the price is good. The eligibility for free 2 day shipping under the annual plan was a bonus."
1,A total rip off,The discription said a pack of 12. One box of 40 filters arrived. ONE BOX for $21.60? Not only was it a total lie but the box had been opened and abused. I was very disappointed.
1,Wrong info in ad!,"Very poor service & wrong information in ad. Was sent only 2 boxes of 40 when I ordered 24. Took 3 phone calls & online messages,still didn't get them. Very bad practice to advertise and not come through! I could not believe that this happened!"
2,Disappointment,"Thought my wife would like it, so I ordered it without telling her. Now I cannot return even the huge box of filters, so I am stuck with them. She went back to her Mr. Coffee after trying it only once."
1,Too many coffee grounds in pot!,I got a whole case of these and I have to put one of my old 'bunn' filters below the cone filter just to keep the excessive amounts of coffee grounds out of my pot of coffee. I'm very unhappy with these filters.
2,"Good filters, problem with shipment","I recently purchased #6 Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, advertised as 40-count, pack of 12. I received only 11 40-count boxes of filters within my sealed (box of 12). So while this is a good quality product, I was disappointed in the discrepancy. Have others had this problem?"
5,Kitchenaid reapairs,Our kitchenaid mixer is very old but very well made. This was a much needed replacement to keep our mahine running.
4,Make sure you order TWO of these,"I figured this would be a kit of 2 and didn't realize it was a single item.I'll give a better review later when I order another but for now, here's a reminder to order two."
3,"Good true crime book, but...","The author jumps around a lot in time, and this type of writing style is hard to follow. The pictures in the middle are excellent.This book is very hard to read due to its subject matter (the killing of a family by their daughter and her boyfriend) , but riveting."
4,It was ok,"this is for Mike M. He said there was a better book titled""Mom, Dad, Mike & Patty. I looked it up on Amazon & could not find it. I need to know who wrote it."
5,Unbelievable story!!,"I honestly couldn't put this book down. Usually skeptical about true crime stories, i was reluctant to read it. However, Howard laid out the facts and drew me into the story until i couldn't stop reading it. Amazing true story. I would like to know what happened to Uncle Gus....?"
4,Tragic Page Turner,"This was a very sad, tragic tale about a young girls descent into a hellish nightmare she could not pull herself out of. I thought the author did a stellar job getting at the facts but the chronology of the story with its jumping back and forth from month to month and year to year was a tad confusing. All in all it was a an incredible story and the stuff of Hollywood movies. I hope Frank DeLuca is having himself a dandy time in prison with all the sex perverts. He's right at home."
2,A fan level Star Trek short story with illustrations.,"This is one of those quirky books in the Star Trek universe that most fans see at conventions. It has quite an amusing storyline, but is very short. Pick it up if you see it at a convention for under $10. Or order and wait through Amazon. Once you start looking for those collectible Star Trek or Dr. Who items, this book should be on your long list"
4,Louis plays the cornet,"This book is a bit long for younger children, but works well for 3-4th graders. If you paraphrase the wording, it might work better to keep the kids' attention. I teach music classes and found this helped the students. There is a part of book that says Louis fired his Uncle's gun off in the street for New Years, so we had to discuss why it was dangerous to do that. Luckily, the book also describes Louis' getting caught by the police in the act. This is a touching story which I hope is true. I'm not sure whether it is or not, but the end is very moving and my students were engaged by it."
3,A possible choice.,"This book is a good buy if you want to share one of the stories of Louis Armstrong with a child. I reitterate, ONE of the stories. When reading about Louis Armstrong, I have come across three different versions of how Satchmo attained his trumpet/cornet. This story suggests that the band directer at the colored-waiffs home for boys gave him his first cornet. This book is a good portrayal of this book if this is the story you believe. If reading for strictly the purpose of introducing a musical legend and/or instrument to a child, this is a great story. If teaching about the person, I wouldn't rely solely on this tale regarding Louis Armstrong."
2,confusing,I had to use this book for one of my undergrad classes. It was not at all helpful. The material is presented in a very boring fashion with not enough explanation to do any hw problems on the material. The least it could do is do some examples that actually show you how they got the solution. The instructor did not help much either which made me hate communications.
1,communication book,"Seller claimed the condition of the book was new with some minor wear and tear. Once I received the book, I found a used book with a lot of pencil marks in the text. The condition was not what I expected. I decided not to return the book since I needed it for my work and I did not want to spend too much time trying to get my money back!"
2,Do not rely on this book as an introduction!,"If you are new to communications, you may want to get a more in-depth exploration of the topics Couch covers (particularly the mathematics). I took this course at the University of Florida (although not with Couch). We were required to buy this book, but the instructor I had DIDN'T USE IT (school politics, I guess).I didn't find it very helpful...not nearly enough examples."
5,Good Book for General knowledge,You can find themes that dose not appear in other books. Every fragment is followed by an example.
3,"good idea, buuuut","this is a great idea for the little ones, but she refuses to use them. So, unfortunately, this was a waste of money."
2,Looks great online....,"I ordered the Silver Forbidden Gothic Pentacle Cross Pendant Necklace expecting what I saw online to be a perfect example of what it could be. I understand that the online pictures are alwase better than what you will get but this does not look or feel like silver. It feels more like a plastic like resin that is more commonly used in gum ball mechine. If your not looking at it closely or people are at a distance to you it looks realy nice but the moment you pick it up you think like all my friends did ""gumball mechine""."
2,Complete it is not,Basically what I found is just when the book was getting into enough detail to be useful the section would end.The book is fine if you haven't ever read an article on dust control. But a two page section on dust control from sanders right at the end of the book??? Come on give us a little meat here. Little detail is given on how to control dust with jigs or with equipment that doesn't have dust control.I gave it 2 stars because I found it wasn't technically detailed enough to be useful and very vague in areas that really needed attention. Took me 3 hours to read it..I'll put it on the book shelve where ironically enough it will probably gather dust.
3,OK Book ...spends a lot of time on common sense stuff,"The book is ok, but I wish he would spend more time on running a DC system in a small home shop. Also, a topic I was interested in (grounding a pvc based system) was brushed over in less than a page."
5,Well written and covers almost all you would need to know,"Had to saw a lot of MDF in the garage. Wore eye, ear protection, and a full respirator. Had a standard shop-vac hooked up and sucking near the blade. Even with the garage door open, there was fine dust everywhere, and all over me! So I looked for a book on this topic, and found this one. I was debating if I should spend the money for a book just on ""dust control"", but it was well worth it. Learned a lot about dust control, and most of the things can be implemented with out too much financial outlay. It is well written and easy to read, and there are clear diagrams and photos of items mentioned. If you have ever regretted relying only on your shop-vac, and wondered if there was a better way, this is the book that would tell you. The book is also well bound, and the pages are thick and glossy, which makes the words and pictures stand out. Would highly recommend this book."
2,This product is lacking in two key areas,"First, there is no buzzer alarm, only radio alarm. Second, the radio reception is very weak, even in a major metro area like LA."
4,Neo-classical metal,"Originally recorded in 1995, Magnum Opus remains one of Yngwie Malmsteen's better releases. Yngwie's neo-classical guitar style, with its high-speed arpeggios and harmonic minor runs, is now accepted as his trademark. This album succeeds, however, primarily because the songwriting is more melodic, with several outstanding cuts. The vocals are supplied this time by Mike Vescera, who handles the material well. The mastering on this new German edition is impressive, resulting in better sound quality than on the original release."
2,"Depends On Your Dog, Perhaps...Or Perhaps Just Junk","I suppose the life expectancy of this toy depends on your dog. I have an 11 month old Golden Retriever. He is very rough on his chew toys, and ones made of material and stuffing are among his favorites, but last only a few weeks. So I didn't expect this toy to last beyond that. However, I also did not expect the toy to last just minutes.Our dog got the Loofa toy today (Christmas!) as a stocking stuffer. He immediately liked it, fetching it and being amused by its squeaker. But in less than an hour he destroyed it. Now, he is a puppy and a very active chewer, but I would expect a dog toy to be made a little better so it can withstand some moderate chewing.He has other similar fabric toys which lasted much longer, and all were within the same price range?"
5,the squeaker is funny,Okay so the dog is cute but what makes it is the squeaker. it sounds like a duck and my dog just goes crazy for that sound. too cute and love seeing my little guy have fun.
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this for my puppy and when it arrived the squeeker did not work, so I exchanged it for another one. The replacement had a working squeeker and my puppy loved it, but it was not suitable for a young dog. It arrived Saturday and I had to dispose of it on Monday. I won't be buying another one."
2,Doesn't Last,"My seven-week-old puppy likes this toy. However, it cannot stand up to a puppy's chewing. We had the toy for three days before it had a rip in the ear. All of our dog's other toys are still looking fine despite similar chewing, leading me to think that the loofa dog is a waste of money."
1,Not Good,"It's not strong enough for a dog to play with. A few days after, the toy was already scattered into pieces. It shipped right away though."
5,puppy,I love this little dog and so does my Pippa. I am not sure why they call it a loofa because it is soft. I would recommend it. It looks like the one you see on the tv commercial.
1,BIG waste of money!!!!,This toy lasted 5 minutes. We have much cheaper toys that are still going after weeks of play. I thought thiswould last longer. I wish I had paid attention to the reviews - live and learn. Don't waste your money on this toy.
2,Fun toy for light chewers,"This has the potential to be a great toy. There are two squeakers that make two different sounds, and also some crinkly stuffing in part of the dog. However, in less than an hour, my dog was ripping the stuffing out, and that was after I had amputated the chewed up ears and tail. Even though I bought his on sale, these things cost too much to last less than a day."
1,Savings lost on shipping,The price entices you and then you lose any savings on the outrageous shipping charges.
2,Not tough enough,"My corgi had this ripped to shreds in a couple hours. He had fun while he was destroying it, but was generally a waste of money. If you have a strong chewer, this is not a good toy."
2,Bad Bobo,"My miniature Poodle loves her Bobo dog, however they don't last very long, and do a good job of absorbing saliva, so they become very stinky after just a couple of days of play. Better suited for use as a bath accessory than a chew toy I think."
2,"Loofa dog, try at your own risk","I got this for my 10 year old golden retriever who is not the most active thing around but has her share of biting and chewing on things. She did not like this toy one bit. She pretty much stared at it and ignored it. I also have two cats who like to chew on things. However, they weren't impressed either. Needless to say, this is being returned. It does look pretty sturdy in my opinion. It would be good for a dog who likes to play a little rough once you've established that he/she likes the toy to begin with."
5,My dog loves this,"My Boxer loves this toy. It has a squeaker in the head, and another in the lower part of the body. It's long enough that I can play with my dog with it without him accidently getting my hands or fingers. The squeaker does get annoying sometimes when my dog constantly chews on it, but thats the point of it. It lasts a pretty long time. I bought one prior to this, and after hardcore chewing and tugging, the seam finally gave. But this is a great toy.Colors vary. So now my boy dog has a purple one. Before that it was green. You don't get to choose your color. But your dog won't care what color it is."
3,Lasted 3 days,Our puppy LOVED this toy. HOwever it is definitely NOT durable!! The stuffing was coming out by day 3. this was a real disappointment.
5,"SKIPPY, LOVES LOOFA DOG","I RECIVED THE CUTE LITTLE DOG VERY FAST, HE WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION AND WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED, I HAVE WANTED TO GET ONE OF THESE LOOFA DOGS FOR MY SKIPPY BUT, THEY COST SO MUCH IN STORES I HAVE SEEN THEM, SO THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THEM AT A PRICE I COULD AFFORD! I HAVE HAD SOME PEOPLE ASK WHERE I GOT HIM, SO I TOLD THEM TO LOOK ON AMAZON FOR YOU! WE GOT A BLUE ONE, PERFECT!!!!"
4,Our Blue Heeler Loves Them.,"She's rough on all kinds of toys, and this one doesn't last long, not only because she fetches and shakes it around like a bear with a fish, but because our beagle gets jealous of her playing with me and tries to ruin every toy she gets. Still, it makes both of them more active in the winter months and inside the house, and for the price you can't go wrong. They are easily replaced."
3,"Not really a sturdy toy, but lots of fun","I have 4 very large golden retrievers and they loved their toys on Christmas morning. They're not the hardiest of toys, and my dogs destroyed 2 of them right away, but they loved the 2 squeakers and seem very attached to the remaining toys even now. If your dog loves to chew on things then I'd advise you to either buy something a bit more solid or monitor them to make sure they don't ingest the squeakiesI'd buy them again, the shipping / purchase experience was fine."
5,Dog loves it!,My Pomeranian loves this toy. Medium size is good for small dogs. My friends dog as a large one and he will actually spend hours chewing and playing with his large sized one.
5,It's BoBo!!!!,"My dog, Tobi, ADORES his BoBo .. . Or at least he did until he took a whizz on it and we had to throw it out (he was heart-broken afterwards :C ) . . .Anyways, it lasted about a month or two so I consider that long-lived for a stuffed animal . . . It never got a hole or tear in it like all of Tobi's other stuffed animals and, believe me, Tobi chewed on BoBo like no other. I also liked the fact that BoBo had TWO squeakers . . .That drove Tobi INSANE (in a good way of course . . . I think) . . . I'm pretty sure we all miss BoBo and Tobi's antics involving BoBo so I'm seriously debating get Tobi a new BoBo. Yay for BoBos!!!"
1,"Loofa Dog 12"" Plush Dog",VERY disappointed ... $5.99 and gone in a flash. Our pup dismantled this toy in under 10 minutes. Ears and hang hook pulled out and eaten instantly. Large squeaker pulled out of disemboweled toy ... part of it missing and probably ingested. And YES between my husband and myself we WERE watching her. It was just that fast. NOT for a dog with teeth and a beating heart. Cute for putting on a shelf and looking at.
5,My two small male dogs LOVE this boguse growling tug-of-war,Squeakers and sewing more durable than many plush dog toys. This is my second Loofah of this size. More than satisfied with the value given the four-for-three promotion and free shipping when the order total exceeds $25.
4,Fun but messy,"I had gotten one of my dogs this toy and she went nuts! My dog is quite spoiled and has a lot of different toys, but the Loofa dog is by far and away her favorite. Everytime I come home she immediately runs to get the toy so we can play. The first couple of loofa dogs I bought were from Petsmart and I paid over 2x as much so this is a great price! The only downside is that when she first gets the dog (this is about the 3rd one I've bought her) she tears it up a bit, but after I tell her to be nice she stops trying to get the stuffing."
4,My dog loves the toy but its shredded so quickly....,"My dog absolutely LOVES this toy...but he shred it and destroys it so quickly! I bought him one because he loves it so much, but within about 30 minutes of giving it to him, he ripped the tail off and the ears off and was pulling stuffing out of the head and the back end of the dog!! Stuffing was getting everywhere and he found the squeaker and ripped it out within seconds. If your dog doesnt destroy stuffed animals, I'm sure he/she would love it - but it just goes so quickly if you're dog likes ripping them apart!! I like the 18in dog for my dog - who is a cockapoo and about 30 lbs....we had previously gotten him smaller versions of this toy it was just too small."
3,A consumable toy,"Our dog loves this toy, but disembowels it within a few days. She's had four or five of these toys so far. They have squeakers in the heads and in the feet, so she usually gets several hours of enjoyment pulling the stuffing out until she reaches the squeakers (at which point we intervene and remove the squeakers).As long as you understand that your dog probably will destroy this toy within a few days or weeks, it's a great toy for the low price."
3,Beware Not For Bulldogs!!!!,Received this today for my Bulldog and what a bad Idea. Within 5 minutes she ripped off the arms she ripped off the tail and she ripped the squeeker out of it. My house looked like a Winter Wonderland with all the cotton she tore out of it. Nice toy just not for Bulldogs:)
1,Unsafe,"This is unsafe, fell apart with in 2 days. Do not buy this for your pet. Very sorry I got this."
5,Doggie Security Blanket,"I buy this toy every month or two for my pug-chi doggie. It is NOT durable but for a stuffed toy its the most lovable form possible. The toy is long enough that your hand has options if a side is too wet to play. My pup love this so much that it quickly became a best friend rather than his normal 'toy to destroy' mode. It lasts a while only because he is gentle with it, he chews delicately with a weird enjoyment rather than purpose vibe. Haha anyways its cheaper online so I'm coming here for future purchases!"
1,Does not last!,"My dog LOVES this toy, but it does not last long at all. He tore a huge hole in it the first time he played with it. I stitched it back together, but he kept destroying it every time he played with it. I got tired of constantly having to sow it and threw it away after a week. I would not recommend this toy."
1,"Didn't last 5 minutes, don't waste your money!","Less than five minutes after I gave my dogs this toy they had stuffing falling out of it. They have a million cheap-o target toys that still squeak and aren't falling apart at the seams but this one just didn't hold up. It's a waste of money and a pain in the patootie gathering up all the stuffing. Much better luck with those AKC toys (i.e., the duck or chipmunk)."
3,Squeaker faulty,"Squeaker did not work when I received it. My miniature pincher still likes it even though the 12"" one is still a bit big for her."
2,used once and tossed it out!,it did not get warm... maybe tingly. It was very liquidy and messy. And it felt to me like there was sand in it! OUCH!Not worth the money.
2,Free Sample,I received a free sample of this in the magazine. It was not that good. It didn't really warm up. It is just like normal lubricant. I couldn't feel the difference.
3,The product is exactly as specified and I LOVE the chocolate!,This is a great product and would always recommend it. I was not so happy with the vendor since the item did not ship in time. They used the weather as a reason however if it cannot ship during certain times or temperatures that should be listed on the add so that buyers can take that into consideration before purchasing or they should have specialty packaging that allows them to ship year round. Just a thought. I have since received the item although it was much to late for the event that I ordered it for but Im sure I will end up using it at some point.
4,Bullets without a budget,"This film is able to compensate for a lack of budget with lots of bullets to please any fan of gun fu. The actors do a repectable job playing everything serious but it's the explosive action scenes that make this film fun. The action is fast and furious without being too over the top or unrealistic. The violence keeps the gunfire reallistic and threatening. If you like gritty, bloody triad films and don't mind the lack of budget this is the film for you."
5,Awesome Selections,"I bought this for 2 reasons, Sia's Breathe & DCBC Transatlanticism, and was pleasantly surprised to find several other gems on this disk. The music was totally fitting to the series, and a nice selection of songs!!"
5,Outstanding!,No Six Feet Under collection would be complete without this CD.I only wish 'Calling All Angels' and that hauntingly beautiful music played over the credits of the finale episode had been included.
2,If you like the music from Six Feet Under then you'll like this soundtrack,"I purchased this soundtrack because my wife wanted the song on the soundtrack by Sia. Overall the soundtrack is ok, however knowing what I know now I could have gone to iTunes to buy the one song she wanted."
1,Buried Alive!,"Finally, I can hear the last sounds.This soundtrack is real swansong of six feet under.Everything really ends!Hopefully, they don't brake the silence of grave and do more soundtracks.It is good to stop here!"
5,Recommended for Muslims before anyone else...,"please don't buy into the portrayal of Islam as oppressive and unfair to women. Learn as much as you can before jumping on the hate bandwagon. There's more to life than just what YOU may hold to be true. Again, for a good explanation of the status of women and men in Islam, study this work by a great contemporary Islamic scholar, an excellent speaker, and a true gentleman.As-Salaamu A'alaikum."
3,Koralia 4 & 8 reveiw,"This is a good product, but I found the circulation to be a little light. Bought two of these but was sill lacking enough of a current in my 180 gal tank. Added a Koralia 8, and it's just about right. The Koralia 8 is much smoother on start up and doesn't shutter."
1,DONT SWITCH IT OFF,"I purchased this powerhead with high expectations. I positioned it in my tank, turned it on, and it worked. I wanted to adjust it though, so I unplugged it, moved it to another spot, plugged it back in, and....nothing. The propeller would not spin no matter how many adjustments I made. This is not a fluke with this one powerhead either. I had the exact same problem with theKORALIA 2 UL 600 gph 4.5W. Koralia powerheads are not suitable for on and off use. Don't buy them."
3,Not so good,If your daughter likes disney princesses she will enjoy the show. However as an adult I thought it was lacking the appeal that disney usually offers.
4,A nice distraction,"This was not a feature length film, but two short shows combined. It was a nice distraction for my girls, the princesses learn good lessons. It is not a ""family movie night"" kind of show, but perfect to put on so that I could get some things around the house accomplished. It is not the kind that they will be watching over and over, but they enjoyed it while they watched it."
3,Little Girls Movie,"My 3 year old granddaughter loved this movie. We watched it several times during the rental time frame. The message in the movie was very good. Delaney, my granddaughter, followed it well and came away with a good lesson too."
2,Not up to Disney Standards,"My daughter loves Disney princesses, she watches all of the movies and sing- alongs but this didn't hold her attention for more than ten minutes. It is not good quality in my opinion, not what you would expect from Disney."
3,Kid Princess Movie,"My daughter loves the Disney princesses, and watches their movies over and over. She seemed to like this movie, but hasn't really cared about watching it again."
5,Great Disney Princess Story Extension,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter absolutely loves the Disney Princesses and couldn't wait to get this movie. I did not buy it at the store as it was $20 for a couple of shorter movies, but once again found a great deal on Amazon. All I can say is when will the other princesses have their enchanted tales released?"
4,Good video - not so good extras,"My girls (ages 2.5 and 4) love all the princesses so they love this video also, but we were rather disappointed in the games. The Jasmine one isn't too bad (though after you've played through the three different paths there isn't any reason to do it again). The Aurora one is more appealing to my kids - dressing up Princess Aurora, though you can't make a ""bad"" choice, you will be told that isn't a good choice and my biggest complaint is that you get to see the outfit you picked for her to wear for exactly 4 seconds!!! What's up with that? My girls want to look at her all dressed up, but she flashes by standing next to the table and that's all you see of her the whole game! I give is four stars b/c my girls do enjoy the film, but the extras really aren't worth much."
2,could have had at least one more princess story,"I did like both of these stories. They just seemed so quick to me. I paid 5 bucks to rent this movie. I think Disney went kinda cheapo on this one. They spit out two quick little cartoons,slap it in a box and call it a movie. I think they could have at least added one more princess story in there."
2,Okay movie,Not very original on the premIse. My daughter liked it but it did not hold her attention long. Really could have saved my money
2,Not Disney's finest,"I didn't have very high hopes for this, but I was surprised it failed to engage my three year old princess-addicted daughter. Don't waste your money/ time."
3,Should have bought something else,"My daughter, she's two, will sit and watch it. But it cost the same as a Disney classic and it's only got two stories; it's short and sweet and promotes good values but since I have to sit and watch it also; sometimes more than once a day I think I should have bought a Disney Classic or a couple of the Barbie movies for the same price."
1,I received a bad DVD,"I tried this DVD in three different players and all three wouldn't play it correctly. The video would break up/pixelate in the first two players, the main segment just wouldn't play in the third. I must have received a bad copy. I've had to contact Disney for support."
2,Barbie as The Island Princess is Better,"I own both movies and after watching both, although I am a hard core Disney Princess Fan,Barbie as The Island Princesswas much better.The Enchanted Tales was teaching a lesson in a VERY obvious way and the songs and animation were not up to the Disney standards I'm used too.The Island Princess had great songs and a heartwarming story, and taught everyone a subtle lesson. Several actually including ""You can love more than one"" Great for parents having a second child or if your child is having trouble with 2 best friends...So I say BUY Barbie RENT Dinesy Princess."
3,Kids love it...a bit tiring for the adults,"The lessons it tries to teach are great, it's good that Disney is moving towards having their princess's with a bit more substance. The first one is Aurora, she's got the keys to the kingdom and has to perform royal duties while not taking the easy way out by using the wand she borrowed. The second is Jasmine where she perseveres and accomplishes her goal of returning her father's horse to him. The kids love it, but it's not the greatest animation, creativity or singing of a Disney film."
2,Plain cartoons...,"I wasn't expecting much of this movie, but it failed to entertain my littleNieces. I would not recommend this tittle to anybody!"
1,Don't let the characters fool you.,"The production, characters, and voice overs couldn't hold my 3 year old's attention. She'd rather look out the window, and she loves princesses."
3,Pleasant but pointless,"I bought this to help entertain my 3-yo daughter during her brothers soccer practices. There's really nothing exciting or different about the stories, but it kept her from getting bored."
2,Kinda cute,My 4 and 6 year old daughters weren't interested in watching this more than once. Wish I rented it instead of purchasing.
2,OK,"This movie was ok....I was expecting it to be more about the punk scene and not just a bunch of black kids complaining. Granted I'm a black female in the punk scene, well in my city the underground, squat, basement show, DIY scene. This movie was rather disappointing. While I have experienced most of the issues they talked about, It just felt like complaining and I found my self thinking ""Deal with it"" or ""What are you going to do about it?"" through the majority of this movie...."
2,Feels Dated and Not a Particularly Good Documentary,"Alot of the isolation these people feel is due to their atypical appearance and tastes in music; however, It is no longer unusual to see black teenage boys wearing tight jeans, gauges in their ears and dyeing their hair....so, eccentric, non-traditional styles and preferences are no longer taboo amongst black youth; making this film somewhat dated. The people in this film were hard to connect to as we only got snippets and summaries of their lives in brief interviews. It feels like each of these people had 7-minute interviews that were chopped up into a movie; it's really a bunch of mini-interviews, not a documentary about people's lives. And listening to them whining about how hard it is to be black wasn't particularly interesting. I am black so I know what it's like; that's old news. Give me something new."
2,Misleading,"I'm a suburban white girl, in my mid thirties, and I have come to realize that punk rock is for us old folks now. Having been in a few scenes here and there, there is always the token black kid among them. I was looking for a real innovation, perhaps a personal story or two. Instead, I got a very generalized look at why others are punk rock. Alienation, feeling outside of society, feeling misunderstood are all a part of it. These black kids that were profiled in this documentary were one of the few black people in their community. They will naturally look to what the white kids are doing for entertainment. Maybe this was with limited access to cable television and the Internet, but it's really not surprising how black teenagers will look to punk rock in some places and hip hop in others.There are no surprises here. The only highlight was seeing a few interviews with members of the Dead Kennedys. Otherwise, not very entertaining."
4,Gods of the Egyptians,"Published more than 100 years ago, it still appears to carry authority. Very detailed account of Egyptian deities. Needs concentrated reading; of interest to people with more than a passing interest in the topic. New edition. A second volume follows this."
3,Krups Replacement Carafe for Model 136,"If you have a model 136 and need a new carafe make sure you save the lid from your old one. Although this replacement carafe is the same size, the lid is different. The replacement lid has a rise in the center (which prevents you from brewing a pot of coffee) whereas the old one is recessed in the center. Fortunately the lids are interchangeable so you will able to use the new carafe with the old lid."
3,Very overpriced,"These are perfect replacements for our Krups dual coffee maker. However, since they are not avaiable anymore, these were WAY overpriced. The cost of 2 of these was what I paid for the machine a few years ago."
3,Bell Key 'N Go Steel Cable Padlock for Bike,"While this obviously is a very well known brand and is a quality product Bell has failed to provide a well made lock it seems the shakle is thin and easily cut with a bolt cutter or some other tool however the body of the lock is hardened steel case which stands up to punnishment like dropping etc, I replaced this lock with a better quality lock that I know I can trust, the steel cable is very good"
3,Good theft deterrent,"This should not be considered a standalone lock for a high risk area, but it is a quick and handy way to make your bike a little less attractive to steal. The ease of use ensures that it will get used frequently, and any lock has to be better than nothing at all.My preferred use for this lock is as a backup for a good U-lock. With both locks, the bike looks fairly unfriendly for carrying away, and it allows you to lock the front wheel without removing it, which I find quite a pain."
3,Cheap. Works. Not secure!,"It's better than nothing, but do realize that the cable can be compromised with relatively little effort (I'm told thieves simply insert two metal rods in one of those small loops and twist in opposite directions)."
4,Use with another lock!,"I only use this lock to secure my front wheel which is a quick release wheel. I needed something light along with my U lock to secure my bike in these mean NYC streets... Anyways, its great if you're not securing your bike with this alone, i normally have 3 different locks when securing outside of my school because i leave it there all day while i'm in class. Thieves tend to be lazy, so the more you have the more unwilling they are to break through them. Unless of course you're bike is worth all that work. Wish the cable was shorter and beefed up the lock a bit but oh well. You get what you pay for."
4,Good length,"Good lock, although the lock itself feels flimsy because of the plastic cover. The cable is a good length. I use it to secure two bikes to a bike rack and am able to go through the body and front rims of both."
3,does an ok job,"I've had this knife sharpener for quite a few years and it does a fair job of sharpening a knife, equal to any of the expensive electric ones. However, if you have spent good money on expensive well made forged knives, learn to use the steel. Using a sharpener can damage your blades. This one took a large knick out of the edge of my favorite chef's knife. Precision ground forged knives require precision angled sharpening, which a home sharpener cannot do properly, and can actually ruin your knives.I only use this now on my cheaper, stamped knives. For my forged blade knives, I take them to a professional sharpening service once a year. Well worth the few dollars."
5,knife sharpeners,"I bought this as a gift for my sister, but I've had one for many years, and it still works great! It might be a little pricier than the others, but it will do a good job and outlive many of your knives...."
2,Touble with mattress,"This mattress has some toxic fumes (chemicals from it being new) and we have not been able to air it out in the week that we have had it. It is so bad that we get headaches, and I can't find contact informtion to ask about this. Any suggestions?"
3,The B side is the only one worth playing,"In response to the guy before me...are you serious? This album stinks of modern technology. This definately is not Jimmy at his best. If you want what the last guy calls, ""true reggae"", go buy equal rights or mama africa by Peter Tosh, some Steel Pulse or Toots and the Maytals. The A side doesn't even sound like a reggae record. It sounds like something you would here on the station at the dentist office.This album's not all bad though. The lyrics are there, but the music is lacking. Like I said the B side is good. I would still buy the record for the last five songs, one of which is the classic cover of ""Johnny Too Bad"". I gave it 3 stars because only half of the songs are worth listening too, and even then, there are better songs and albums to listen to than this one. To each their own."
1,For Completists Only,"The only good writing in this book is Carolyn Cassady's introduction. Most of these photos have appeared before. The editing is odd in that there are dozens of good photos of Kerouac that are only 1x1"" and several full page photos of city scenes with no Kerouac content whatsovever. The text is lame. For those who want to complete their Kerouac reference librarys no matter the quality of the product."
3,"Illustrated, but not Illuminated","This book offers more unique photos of Kerouac and associates than any other Kerouac book, including ""Angel-Headed Hipster."" But the same problems with most Kerouac biographies are present in this one as well. The biographer, David Sandison, seems more intrigued by Kerouac's image rather than his substance. Of course, this is why he painstakingly gathered the photos and presented them here. As usual, Kerouac's true motivations and inner demons are given only passing references, in favor of the more cinematic qualities of his life, eg. the women, the booze, and the fast cars. This book is not for the critical Kerouac reader seeking literary insight. It is, instead, for those enamored with the Kerouac Legend.If you truly want to get personal with Kerouac, pick up anything with Ann Charters' name on it. She has proven, by far, to be the world's most authoritative and compelling Kerouac scholar."
3,Nice pictures,"This book features a great collection of photographsdocumenting Kerouac and his circle of acquitancesspanning an impressive length of time. I would have likedthe author to have spent a little bit more timeexploring Kerouac's spiritual side, as oppossed to the mediaorientated recitation of random incidents, but Iunderstand for it is the latter which pushes book exposureand sales. Still, it was a book which I would encourageothers to read."
1,Disappointing at best,"One inch of the eight is the name tag (belkin), another inch is the hook portion of Velcro. If there is any movement in the cable bundle you wrapped, it all comes undone, (except that 1"" of Valcro) What a waste of money. Buy something else, I am having to."
2,Get a better buy at Dollartree,"These ties work, but they are not really 8"" velcro cable ties. They are 7"" of velcro cable tie plus a 1"" non-velcro Belkin tab.Dollartree has basically the same product in its hardware section, only with 7.5"" of useable velcro and a much shorter tab (that still does a perfectly good job of facilitating removal), for $1.00. There are only five ties in the Dollartree package, but they are still a much better deal.The facing velcro strip (the piece that adheres to the velcro strip) is a little shorter on the Dollartree ties, so the Belkin tie might hold better if you are wrapping cable that is a little large for the length of the cable tie. But since the Dollartree ties are longer, they would fit comfortably around the same cable, so I think that's a moot point."
3,better options available,"i definitely prefer the radio shack ties because you can adjust the tie to the size of the tie to the cable, and the whole strip is velcro so no extra cable hangs off of the bundle. but these are a little cheaper and work most of the time too."
3,needs an anchor,In theory a good idea however it needs an anchor so it can stay in one place when undone otherwise it works just like velcro
4,Great Cable ties for big wires. Just know they won't work well on smaller applications.,"This is a great set of reusable color codes cable ties for medium to large wires. They are a bit to big for smaller wires and you need to get at least a thumb full of wire to secure them properly(Picture sizing out Spagetti for two people big). If you need it for a few small wires it won't work as well. These are also a bit hard to use inside a computer case because of the excess material. I see the appication for these more like using them to bind togther cords from a home entertainment system, or the mess of cords coming from the back of the computer."
3,colorful,"well, they are velco so they work. they do get lost easily though, kind of wish i had bought a different kind...."
4,Can't have too many.,"If rogue cables and wild wires drive you nuts, these are the ticket to tidiness. I have already ordered two additional packages."
5,"Terrific price, very handy item.","I've looked far and wide for this style of tie and was incredibly happy to see the always affordable Belkin brand be there for me. Terrific price and very well made. Buy more than one pack and keep these handy in the shop, because they are useful for so much more than tying cables."
3,"A little flimsy, but a good value","It's hard to tell from the pictures, but these straps do not have velcro material down the full length of the back side. ""Fuzzy"" velcro material covers all of one side of each strap, however the back side of each strap is smooth except for a small swatch of the ""hook"" velcro material near the end with the black Belkin label. It's more than enough to grip, but they don't hold nearly as effectively as those found inVelcro #90438 1/2x8 Get A Grip VelcroorVelcro(R) Brand One-Wrap(R) Cableties 8in Blk 25pk."
2,Waaaay over priced,"Same functionality without the pretty colors: 100 ties for under $10.Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties, 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches Long, Black, 100 Ties per Pack (91140)"
2,"If you're a musician, forget these.","I'll never understand why re-useable cable ties are so expensive, or so unavailable. These Belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation. And even for that purpose, I don't care for their design.If you are a musician looking to tie up microphone, speaker or instrument cables, these are not suitable."
2,"A bit flimsy, works ok but not good value for the money","Not a very efficient solution if you need to wrap and unwrap your cords more frequently. It's just a long strip of Velcro, much longer than I actually need so most of the material is wasted and even gets in the way (as you have to wrap it around and around). This also makes it more time-consuming to wrap cables."
2,Poorly thought out design,"I have used a couple of types of Velcro cable ties in the past. The best ones have hooks all along one side and fuzz all along the other with a slot in the top, so you can loop it around the cable at one end so it stays attached even when the cable is unwrapped. These have hooks only on about an inch or two at one end of the tie. You have to wrap it carefully (and not particularly tightly) around the cable bunch until you get to then end with the hooks. If you unwrap the cable the tie falls off. These a just considerably more annoying to use than the type I first described. One other review mentioned these work best in more permanent installations where you aren't going to be undoing them regularly. True, but plastic zip ties and twist ties also work for this at a fraction of the cost."
4,"Work, But Overpriced?","Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center. In essence, they work. They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords, holding them in one, neat bundle. They aren't really meant for identifying cables, but for holding several in a bundle. Because they work great, I can't give them less than 4 stars. $3 and change is pretty cheap, but if you wanted, you could do the same job with much cheaper products, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.Summary: Works great. Cheap, but cheaper options available."
2,Too hard to fasten,"The areas of hooks and eyes are so small as to make this product useless. At least, fastening four or five mic cables together turned out to be a challenge. I don't want a challenge: I want to fasten and unfasten easily. Buy something else."
5,Nice for organizing,These are great for tying up cords and the different colors make it easy to identify the cords to the component.
3,Could be better designed,"The cloth pull tab on the end labeled ""Belkin"" tore off one of the ties on the first use. I use them to tie up my various computer cables for my laptop when traveling. My biggest objection to the design of the ties is that there is no means of permanently attaching them to the cord, so when removed for use, they can get lost. I slit a hole in one end so I could loop them around the cord and then run the tie back through the slit to hold them in place. Not pretty, but seems to worked OK."
5,Reusable,"Quick, reusable, and color coded... these velco cable ties are a fast and effective way to cable management. Easy and reusable, unlike zipties."
1,Cut your own --ANY SIZE from 16x48 sheet,"Save yourself time, energy and gain a filter that will fit any size. Buy Cut-to-fit Carbon for Air Purifiers 16'x48"" and use scissors to cut to size. Instead of paying $5 for 3 crescent shaped filter, you will get 500-100 filters from this media ... works well!I chose to make this substitution after noticing that the moon shaped filters were the WRONG ones for my Presto Cool Daddy and reading several reviews."
2,False advertising on Amazon.com's part,Ordered Cool Daddy Fryer along with Amazon.com recommended additional replacement filters. But filters do not fit the fryer ... apparently for different model of fryer than the one Amazon sells. Was not worth the trouble to return filters. Told Amazon about their error in not matching the filters with the fryer but nothing done about it. Filters are for newer model of Cool Daddy Fryer which Amazon does not sell. They are selling older model which uses different shaped filter.
2,Waste of $$,"After reading great reviews of this product, I purchased it. I had previously tried the EAS lite ready to drink shakes and they were awesome. These were nothing like the yummy EAS lite shakes. They were gross. I threw up trying to choke it down. It has texture of vomit. Dont waste your $$!! Buy the EAS lite ready to drink ones instead!!!"
4,Review of Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits,More plant breeders should read and understand this book. It is a great basis on which to build the future of plant breeding.
2,"A seriously flawed book, but with such potential....","If you can get beyond the incredibly shoddy editing of this book (for example, the identified Gable is not always Gable), the heavy empahsis on Cooper and other sartorial conservative icons, and the uninspired (repetitive) use of language, you might come away with something useful from this book. In the end, the book's abrupt ending--it just stops--is representative of how its wonderful concept is so very poorly executed. This book never lives up to its potential, and both men's style and the movies deserve more."
5,Style can't be taught--but it can be inspired!,"This isn't a book for beginners. If you need someone to teach you how to get dressed--buy another book. But if you want inspiration for developing your own style, this book will get you excited about getting dressed in the morning. It doesn't dictate how you should dress. Instead, it tries to show timeless style from the kind of men other men look up to."
2,This book is dated,"It is strange this book was published in 2002, but the pictures in it looks like it was taken in 1972! Let me give you a few examples.. this book is full of pictures of ""old time favourites"" like James Dean, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. etc.For people who likes the classics, that is good.. but for those who admire Pierce Brosnan, Dylan McDermott(The Practice), Tom Cruise, Ben Afleck etc.. don't touch this book with a 10 foot pole!When I talk about movies.. I mean 1990-2000 movies such as The Boiler Room and so on and not Saturday Night Fever."
5,The best album,"This is the best The Runaways album. I bought the album when it was first released, but that vinyl edition has long been living in lost record world. The tracks on the ""Queens of Noise"" are powerful, played with impressive talent, and have a unique nastiness. The mood is definitely punk, but also feminine, in the bad girl sense. A typical all-male or minority-female rock band can't even come close to what The Runaways created. Bottom line: This is real rock that you can blast in your car as you drive to the job you never imagined yourself having when you first heard ""Queens of Noise."""
1,Useless AppleScript Book,This AppleScript book is so old and out of date that it is useless. If you want to learn AppleScript this book is not for you. The book is poorly written and organized. The book should receive zero stars. Do not be fooled by the five star rings. The seller was very prompt in sending the book and it was received in excellent condition.
5,Holiday Shopper,I was very happy with purchase. My 8 year old son wanted a packer uniform from Santa knowing that I was a Viking fan and would never purchase it for him. With last minute holiday shopping the uniform was delivered quickly and nicely packaged and my little packer backer was very happy and full of believing in Santa. Would purchase from again. Thank you.
5,Beats the heck out of paint-by-numbers.,"Like many other coloring books in the Dover Series, ""Tropical Flowers"" is suited for older children, adults & a good set of colored pencils. Also painlessly educational. Beats the heck out of paint-by-numbers.Bob Rixon"
5,"A Thick, Single-Volume Reference Book Packed with Information","This review is based on the 1968 edition. Each chapter is written by a separate specialist. There is a wealth of data on such things as masonry construction, timber engineering, steel construction, soil mechanics, frame analysis, shell structures, long-span roofs, properties of steels, barrel vaults, bridge design, rigid joints, wind deflection of structures, design of towers, and much more."
2,damaged book,"The book was damaged. The pages were bent and the binding was broken. Definitely not ""new"" condition. I needed the book and did not have time to return (or did I know how). It was shipped in a padded envelope vs a box. I e-mailed the seller with no response.Jerry"
2,Unit problem,"This book is quite good but its usability is lost to a great extent because it is not written in Metric units. Also, chapters on computer application are not well written"
1,THIS IS A PIECE,"Ripped off, this product would not even power on, seemed to be damaged- very cheap feeling productDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR BUY FROM THIS SELLER"
1,What bike lock?,"This lock never left my bike frame and I always utilized it whenever I left my bike out alone. Came outside of work one day and bike and lock both were gone. I read some reviews that after time this lock would pull apart quite easily.Wish I had invested in a better lock, $500 bike stolen."
4,Bike lock,"It is a good product overall, should do a job in low crime areas.However it is quite difficult to coil/uncoil it arond the seatpost or bike frame."
1,useless,"My bike was stolen, when I used this lock, Don't fall for the cheap price, invest in a better lock that cant be broken by a simple manual cutter."
2,bell watchdog lock,was supposed to include a hook which i did not receive. much heavier than expected
1,donate to animal rights cause instead of buying this book,"The author (now deceased) writes that he and his wife, after some years raising Lucy, decided they wanted to live ""normal lives."" He claimes that some of the book's proceeds would go for Lucy's care and comfort for the rest of her life. Actually, the Temerlins cruelly abandoned Lucy to the wild, where she died tragically. (Janice Carter tried to help Lucy.) My recommendation to prospective buyers of this book is to donate your money to an animal rights cause instead.(I did not read this book, but heard the story on the radio today. After doing some research about Lucy on the Internet, I felt compelled to write this note to encourage prospective buyers not to let anyone profit from cruelty to animals.)"
1,yes it looks great but,"I have never run out of ink with one of these pens--because they stop writing after using not half of the ink. I have many more than one and that has been my experience. The ""gel"" stops flowing to the ball. Expensive dud to me."
3,Not what I thought,I thought I ordered capped pens.What I got was retractable (ball point).But they work exactly as I want so it doesn't really matter that much.
5,Excellent Pen,"The pen has an excellent liquid flow (although it does take a few moments to dry on paper). Impact RT is bigger than the average Uniball pen, and the rubber grip adds a degree of comfort. Overall, a better pen than the Pilot Precise."
3,BEWARE - NOT ORIGINALS,"Beware, these are not original 60s/70s recordings. Melba recorded these tracks for Playback Records in the early 90s. Although Melba is still a great singer, if you want the sound you were familiar with in the 60s, you will not find it here.I wish someone would license her masters from the 60s/70s and produce a decent CD of her original recordings."
1,Poor Quality Cable,Cheap enough but you get what you pay for. The cable is too thin and caused ghosting on my monitor!
1,waste of even a little money,"This product produces horrible ghosting - why they would make it, I do not know. A total waste of money, unconscionable."
2,"An OK book with the Doctor,the Brigader looking into Hilter","Since I recently finshed reading this novel, I'll post my thoughts on this novel. The Doctor and the Brigader look into appearences of Hilter since his death after World War 2. There is a alien ship involved a little bit. The authors did a good job of putting the Doctor and his friends into history. The Doctor is also helped by a young documentary journalist named Claire. The book at times reads like one of the many purely history based novels like ""The Plotters"" or ""The Witch Hunters"". If you like reading history based Doctor Who books , you might read this book. As for me I prefer the Doctor stopping alien invasions etc over the histroy based. I doubt I will ever read it again as there was not enough aliens involved in this novel."
2,Southern Europe Marco Polo database,"Data was minimally useful. Too few cities, and too few categories in places where there was data."
1,Product placement gone crazy,"Fine book except for one fatal flaw: It's an advertisement. They should pay readers to buy it.Number of non-blank pages in this book: 26Number of pages on which the word ""Tonka"" appears: 26Number of times the word ""Tonka"" appears: 64Number of times the word ""Tonka"" appears per page: 2.46"
4,Great reference book.,This book is pretty neat. Very detailed--it's thick with plenty of material and it makes a nice reference book. If you're a beginner to color theory (like me) this book will help you ease into it.
3,So-so,This book had been recommended for a graphic design class but it was too text based. I found some other books on color that dealt with the subject more effectively with less a technical/abstract approach. The abstract method of explaining color scientifically that this author used did not reach me so much. I found myself trying to translate his meanings in my head. Books that explain color in terms of psychological and emotional effects make a lot more sense to me and quickly get at the impact of color on an intuitional level...where it actually hits the audience.
4,A++,Seller was great! I received the book very quick :) The book was helpful with my Color Theory class.
2,Designer's Color Manual - Shipped very slowly,"The product was as described and it was fine, but it took over a month to ship, which is ridiculous. The project I needed it for was done and turned in by the time I actually received the book."
4,"Yes, the Champs' comparisons are accurate.","The other reviewers here draw parallels between the F*cking Champs and Hematovore, and it's a fair comparison. Both bands have that metallic, mathy sound. Both bands play it instrumental. One difference is that Hematovore does not include those moody synth pieces that cleave Champs albums.So if you've heard the Champs, you already have a good idea on what you're getting here: crunchy, driving, anthemic riffs. Hematovore executes it with aplomb and style; ""Arachnophilia"" is an 8-minute masterpiece, a collection of catchy riffs whose cumulate impact exceeds the sum of the parts.Not everything on this album works, hence the 4 out of 5: a few moments late in the album devolve into over-sludgy down-tempo blocks of sound with little momentum. But there's still plenty here to keep a Champs fan [who has been waiting since 2002 for a new album] satisfied."
5,Time for a winner,"Actually ended up buying two of these, one for both floors of the house. We had to replace our less than a year old Sony's as they had both broke, one had the CD parts fall off and the other keep time from another universe. Yes I did take them back to the dealer and was told to send them to Sony. It was easier and in this case cheaper to buy new units. Easy to use and so far very reliable. I do like the CD track option for wake ups, really is special on those special celebration days for the significant other. I bought one GPX at a local retailer and the second from Amazon. Great product....."
5,Brilliant,"I bought this on a whim when it came out in the 90's. I had no idea who the band was and had never heard anything from them before but something attracted me to the album.When I played it, I was floored. The musicianship is simply brilliant. The songs are expertly played and written. The music is very complex but unlike other bands, the complexity is well-woven together and everything fits well with the other pieces. It's a rock album that is bit industrial with a funk/jazz groove woven into the pieces. It's a fun album and just about every song is good.It is really a shame that they didn't do more albums, but I'm happy that I found the one they did do. I have a huge music collection of thousands of albums and this one is one of the best I have of the 90's era. They really were ahead of their time."
4,...A push from behind for stalled authors...,"This book gives a budding author a ""push"" as it explains how everyday life experiences can be drawn upon and modified to add to the action of what a new author is trying to develop."
4,Witty and inciteful,"You'll be moved to laugh, you'll be moved to write.A nice change of pace from most writing guides. Witty and insightful, Dufresne's book offers guidance on both the creative aspects as well as the more nitty gritty side of writing. He also provides concrete examples, demonstrating the story behind the story with specific references to his own work--an invaluable chance to get into the head of a published author. My only critique was that Dufresne tended to be a bit long-winded, sometimes belaboring points he had already covered thoroughly. I felt the book suffered a bit from a lack of editing, perhaps because Dufresne was in teaching mode (and felt the need to emphasize through repetition) instead of ""murder your darlings"" writing mode.Includes a helpful list of potential resources for writers at the end."
2,This radio/cd player is 'o.k.' but not great,"The clock is hard to read. The background lights up instead of the numbers. The CD player does not remember the previous track location. I use the CD player to listen to books. When the CD player is stopped, it restarts on track number 1."
3,wrong model,it works and has the feature i wanted- plays any trck on cd to wake up but not the same model as in pic
3,Works well except alarm,"All aspects of the radio and cd player work well, except the alarm. When it does work, it turns on at different times, sometimes in the middle of the night. I would set the alarm for 6am and it would go off at 1am. Everything else works great, though."
2,For the price you can do MUCH better...,"Huge. I mean...LoL REALLY huge. Size wouldn't be an issue if it had the corresponding technology; 1atm water-resistance on a near 1lb. watch? Come on man...You might look like a complete ""tard"" wearing this one anywhere other than in the closet on a moonless night. It's a ""faux Russian"" relic. (not made in the U.S.S.R. by the way...) If you're looking for a unique paperweight or an over-the-top costume piece (attention you ""steam-punkers"") this is it...But, wouldn't be your 1st choice on a Saturday night. Or a Sunday afternoon...But, if it is...Then, you've got bigger problems than wearing this watch."
1,Defective Product has now been discontinued,"I purchased this product in June. I absolutely loved it! Much to my suprise, by December, it was no longer working. Since it has a 2 yr. warranty, I contacted the manufacturer (Contech) for a replacement. They were very willing to send a replacement unit. When I received the replacement within the week of my contact, it was not the same procut. They indicated that this particular item had been discontinued (because of performance issues). They could replace the item with the Squirrel stop. I guess that's fine, except that this item is half the price of the Squirrel Scatter Bird Feeder. They were unwilling to adjust my purchase price ($89 vs $45). I don't think I'll be purchasing another Contech product. Buyer Beware!"
5,Good stuff,"Very complete. Its about time someone put the microscope to the results of socialist / communist thought, and its place in history. Well done."
1,"Fat, incomplete, inaccurate","If he had left out the code-word adjectives it wouldn't have been fat, if he had included the Berlin Airlift it would have been more complete, if he had not said that Nixon in 1972 was the ""new"" American president it would have been more accurate, but corrections like these would be required in virtually every chapter - sometimes every paragraph. Regrettably my local library has this book as it's main reference for the Soviet Union. I would hate to see what local High School students are producing for papers in their AP history classes - I think I might just ""lose"" the book so that the library can replace it with something better."
1,"homeopathic, not herbal","I didn't look at the tiny, blurry type on the picture of the bottle. It says ""Homeopathic Medication."" I read the description and skimmed the first three reviews but didn't realize that this ""medicine"" is homeopathic. In other words, it has no active ingredients. It's an expensive placebo. If you believe in homeopathy, then you will have whatever success a placebo will provide."
4,Does seem to help...,"I tried this because the dizziness has become intolerable. I must say I am happy so far, it does not make me drowsy like Dramamine, and works pretty quick, I will be buying again. Thank you for helping :)"
1,Review of Cocculus Compostium,This product left me ill and light headed. I was too dizzy to know if the vertigo and cognitive capabilities were effected.Not recommended. The pills were floating down the sewer withing a week.
3,Could be better,"First off, the knife's locking mechanism started to fail pretty quickly (it didn't stay in open position), so I would not recommend buying it as a reliable assisted opener. Also, the handle was a little too boxy for my liking; I expected it to be a little rounder. The blade was sharp and easy to open with speed. The handle had good grip, as well as good finger holds. I returned mine because of the failing lock."
1,great pant but sizes don't match,I ordered a pair of these yoga pants and loved them so much I ordered 3 more pairs identical to the ones I bought. The problem is when I tried on the three new pairs they were all different sizes. Two of them are smaller than the first and one is larger. Que Pasa?
3,They were too short,"I bought them because some reviews said they were long. They were not long enough for my sister who is 5'8"" which isn't unusual since most yoga pants are too short for her."
5,Awesome!!!,"When they first arrived I thought they would be too small. They looked tiny! They have a good amount of stretch though without being too tight. I am a 12/14. Perfect fit, and length! I am 5'9''...I haven't washed them yet, so I really hope they don't shrink up much. The fabric seems good too. Not too thin, or thick. I would order again!"
2,Bella Cotton Yoga Pant,"These are sized very, very small. A medium is more like a small/junior. Should be specific in description of this product."
4,comfortable,I took the advice of others and ordered one size up from what I expected. The pants are a little looser than I prefer and did not shrink any in the wash/dryer. These do have the cut and shape I like though. Next time I will order the large instead of XL. My typical size is a 10-12 depending on the pattern cut and brand. I have a 33 inch instead and found these a bit long - that could be an issue if you have shorter legs.
3,"They are ok, but too long","I am 5'8 and they were too long. I was not a big fan of the material, either. They are just ok."
2,Good Value but Inconsistant Sizing,"Bought the blue in small and it fit. Then bought the brown in the same size, and it is nearly 2 inches shorter.This is too much of a variation."
4,"Run tall, not wide","If you're 5'8"" to maybe 5'11""? these would be good. They definitely run long. I'm 5'7"" and they drag the floor when I wear shoes. The waist is thick and doesn't give much. I would have liked a more giving fit for better movement."
3,Runs small,"This pant runs small so be aware of that when you buy them, the legs are long too. It fitted and normal fitting and is an ok buy"
4,Spandex Fitness Yoga Pants,"The pants fit perfectly with quite a bit of give when exercising. They are very comfortable around my waist as well. I would strongly recommend these pants to all women, espcially full size-women."
3,Bummer,"Pants wore well and were comfortable at first, but the product didn't hold up after first wash and became a magnet for lint."
4,I like them but a little long.,"I ordered a medium, I am 5' 5"", 130 lbs, with a 31"" inseam. They are an inch or two too long for me, however I like the feel and fit so I am keeping them, I'll either hem or get used to the length. After washing or drying, I didn't notice much shrinking."
4,"Great, except for sizing.","The size chart said a Large covers 41-42.5. I have 42"" hips and the large was way too small. Other than that, the pants are really nice and made out of a great material."
5,Love these workout pants,"I love these pants for a workout. Bought three other colors. Sometimes I find workout pants to be too thin, but these are a perfect weight of knit."
2,A bit cheap,"The fabric is a bit cheap. Order a size up...these are tight. Fine for hanging at the house, but not for running errands or to the gym..."
3,Tight,I generally fit well into a medium in yoga or workout pants but these fit pretty tight. The waistband is not wide like it appears in the picture. The top of the waistband has a tight elastic that is tighter than the rest of the pants.
2,Not flattering,"I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered these in large instead of my usual medium. Definitely the right decision.But overall, I'm not impressed with these pants. They're comfortable but quite unflattering. I'm a slender person with 2 to 3 extra pounds at the moment. These pants just seem to accentuate what I would otherwise like to hide! They hug every contour of your pelvic area (and I do mean every contour if you get my drift).I suppose if you just wanted a comfortable pair of pants to sleep in or wear around the house (to never be seen by others), these will do the trick. But I would never go out in public wearing these unless I had a loooong shirt to wear over them... and good luck finding underwear to wear with them."
3,"Decent yoga pants, for the short term.","These pants are very comfortable and have a very attractive fit, however they fade incredibly quickly and fade horribly. Once I have had them for more than two months, their color can no longer be described as black or even close to it."
3,Nice quality but shrinks one full size,"I purchased three of these yoga pants as I practically live in yoga pants, love flare leg yoga pants andhave a hard time finding them. Used to buy all my flare leg yoga pants from VS but they no longer carry them. These are nice quality, well made BUT don't be deceived by the description that says pre-shrunk - these pants shrink one full size on the first washing. I ordered my true size, washed them and now they do not fit - if you are ordering I recommend you order on full size larger than usual. Also, I am 5'2"" these pants are very long - I would have to wear 3' or 4' heels - sort of defeats the purpose of yoga pants and comfort...."
2,TOO Small:(,"I wear a size W18 pant or Misses XL (Kohls)and the 2XL was much too small. I was hoping the 2XL would be a little loose, as that's how I prefer yoga pants, but I could barely get them on:( Good quality, but they had to go back:("
3,jazz dancer,"Not a fan of this pant, the waist fits too low and keeps rolling down! I hate that! The fit in the leg andlength is right on though. If they had more elastic in the waist or a drawstring they would be better. Noway can I wear these in my Jazzercise class - they would fall down!"
4,Great Pants!!,"Overall, really awesome pants! They are very comfy and are great for yoga! However, they are very, very long. We had to hem them a couple of inches. The color was nice, something different then black. All in all, great pants! Enjoy!"
5,comfy and great fit,"Great comfortable pants for lounging, everyday wear or workout. The fit is great. I'm 5 foot 7 and 150 lbs & the medium fits great."
2,Short and Skimpy,"The fabric was very thin and ""wimpy,"" and they were much too short for my 5'9"" frame. The color was also kind of muddy-looking to me."
3,Meh....,"They're not stretchy, very stiff, and the waistband digs into your hips. However, they did look good, I'd just prefer a more comfy pair of yoga pants. I couldn't imagine doing any yoga in these."
1,Sizing way off,The waist of these yoga pants is so small I could not get them on. No stretch to it. I held these up to other yoga pants of the same size in my closet and the waist was several inches smaller. The material was not soft and comfortable for what I would expect and want in a yoga pant.
3,Seem to run small,"I typically wear size 12-14 pants. That would normally fall in the large size range. I ordered size XL because of reviews here. XXL would be closer to right. The crotch length could stand to be a little longer to avoid the awkward dip in the center back. I've not had a chance to wash and dry these yet but the fabric has a good, heavy feel."
5,I found the perfect yoga pants!,I'm ordering more of these pants as I have just wanted to live in them since I first received them. They are the perfect cut for support and comfort. I love the fabric - soft cotton with just the right amount of stretch. You can't beat the quality. Shipping was fast and the price is just right. Thank you! I couldn't be happier.
3,Not for me,"I've got a couple pair of ""comfort zone"" pants I'm trying to replace. When I search for that, I get the Bella's.Not the same. They run small, material is light. Seller was very prompt with the sale and return."
5,Very comfortable,"Not only does my wife wear these everywhere, she looks great in them also. She will buy more I'm sure."
5,Best yoga pants i've ever found. Love them!,"I just received these pants in the mail and they're great! I am 5'8 so they aren't as long as i would usually like them to be, but they are long enough so they'll do. :). They are comfy and fit perfect!! I will definitely recommend these to anyone to buy. Great for taller women, which yoga pants, as well as all pants are SO hard to find that are long enough for me so i love that about them, but i will most definitely buy ANOTHER pair of these again shortly! :)"
4,Meh,"I gave this product 4 stars because the pants are clearly very high quality and durable. I'm just not sure they're very true to size. At 5'4"" and 118 lbs, a size small should fit great, but sheesh, are these things SNUG! I'd advise to be wary of drying them till you've tried them on and see how they fit on you. I figure if I hang these to dry I can use them. A bit of an inconvenience, but the pants seem to be really durable, so I'll deal with it."
1,Not true to size!,"I bought these pants in anticipation of giving birth in the next week, thinking I needed some comfortable pants to lounge in afterwards. I usually wear an extra large, so because I knew I needed room I bought a 2XLarge. These things did not fit!! I could barely get them over my butt! And they fit VERY snug in the thighs. I know I'm 10 months pregnant, but even my maternity clothes are not a 2XL. Thee things should have fit! They are not true to size, and will NEVER purchase from them again."
4,Nice Yoga pants-order a size up,"Based on other reviewers, I also ordered a size up. I typically wear a size S/4-6, but I ordered the Medium (8-10), and they are perfect! They are also long enough for my 33-34 in inseam, yeah!! The quality of construction is good, and although the fabric is on the thin side, it is not cheap. A good yoga pant for the price."
2,Runs small,"These seem reasonably well made, but they are SO SMALL. I ordered a XX, which I expect to run about size 18-20. These pants might be a largish 14."
2,tight and long,Maybe I just bought the wrong size but i am typically a small and these things are quite tight and quite long. I am 5'4'' and weigh 125 pounds. I wear a size 6ish. These pants probably look great on skinny tall people - but then what doesn't? :-)
1,Switcheroo,"Pants were not the brand I had ordered (Everlast) even thought they looked the same. Pants were marked Large as requested; but they were very small. I do yoga, have many pairs of pants and know the correct fit for yoga pants."
1,Runs WAY small,"The fabric on these is a really tight knit...with little ""give"". They were WAY too small. I was so looking forward to wearingthem and I am greatly disappointed."
2,Not True to Size,"I like the material and design of these pants. Unfortunately, they are way too small. I ordered my size, according to the size chart, but they arrived and as soon as I pulled them out of the package I just folded them up and put them back in the bag. I know for a fact, they wouldn't even go over my hips. I ordered a 2X, they look like a large (at most)."
2,sized small,"Just got these pants in the mail. I ordered a size up as I was looking for a loose fit. upon trying them on, I realized that instead of having a wide elastic band, it is instead very narrow and fits very snug, even though I sized up. I plan on returning these as the fit is uncomfortable. If I would re-order these, I would size up yet another size."
2,Go up a size!!,"Decent pant, but way too small..I'm a small/ medium but the medium was way too small.. Had to send them back!"
2,Too low,"Backside cut way too low for women over 25 and look bad. Kept pulling shirt down, just uncomfortable wondering what is showing."
4,So far great,Got this pair last week. Fit is flattering although a little long on me. Not very thick but nothing shows through and comfy.
4,Cotton Pants,"Love these pants. Nice brown. Haven't washed and hoping color doesn't fade. Washing with cold water and Woolite. 4 stars because it fits a bit snug (5'7/8"", 138lbs). But overall, a great product. Great price!"
1,still to short,"I am 5'9"" but has an inseem of 35 in. I only bought 1 pair to see if they fit but was sad to know that they were to short. It was a reasonable price so instead of returning them I gave them to a friend who could enjoy them."
5,was a little snug,"for an XL, I normally wear a L but thought it might run small and I was right, they are still comfy, but wanted the butt area to have a little more room...."
3,Not Bad,These pants are very nice.. they are a nice light material however I am 5'2 and they are long for me. I am still going to keep them because I dont mind the length long as with my sneeker on they are not dragging on the floor.. Possibly they may shrink a bit in the was. It would be nice if they can in petite or averge lengths. These seem to be somewhere inbetween an average and tall. Other than that they are very nice pants. Also review the size chart before buying. I'm glad I did because it runs exactly as they state on the chart. Without it you may order the wrong size. Happy shopping
2,pants,pants run small ordered a medium ware a 6 didnt fit didnt realize there was a restock fee buyer beware
5,Yoga pants,Very comfortable to lounge in.. Soft cotton material..I sleep in this.. Work and workout.. You could really wear it anywhere
4,"Nice pants, run small","I just received my yoga pants and they are a bit snug! I just had a c-section and needed some extra comfy pants. I ordered a 2X, and the same size in another pair of yoga pants I got recently are extra roomy. I feel like I'm going to bust the seam on these ones! I have quite a large butt and had to squeeze it in there! Besides that, the legs fit nicely, material is nice, and I love the flared bottoms! I can't wait to lose some pregnancy weight and fit in them. I better start doing some yoga!"
2,Nice pants,I ordered an XL size because from reading reviews on the pants they run small and not true to sizes. The reviews were right on point! The XL were more like a med/large. They are pretty pants made from great material.
3,Definitely not petite,"These pants were too long for my wife, who stands all of 5"" 1'. The fault may have been ours, as we don't recall if the ad specified petite size. She couldn't use them, but they seemed otherwise to be made well."
2,too small,"L is not Large - it was Medium.They fit, snugly, but wouldn't have survived the first wash.I returned this item."
2,Yoga pants,"Yoga pants were long and tighter than most. I usually wear a small, but heeding the warnings, I bought a medium, and was still plenty tight. And plenty long too. They're also thinner fabric than I like"
3,"Great fabric, ""butt"". . .","I bought four pair of these yoga pants and was pleased as soon as I pulled them from the package because I could tell they were made of a heavier knit and were sewn extremely well. (I have since laundered the pants and the fabric retained its body.) However, I have two complaints about the sizing of this garment: (1) These pants are rather snug--they are comfortable and stretchy during a workout, but they are not that flattering to my somewhat zaftig body type. (2)These pants are EXTREMELY long, which is not a problem if I am only doing yoga, but if I wear these pants for a more active workout, I have to roll them up to keep from tripping on the hem. So the ""bottom"" line is that these pants are well-made, but they are not too flattering to my derriere and they are overly-long."
2,"Girls Cook Apron, not more","I wanted this set for my 3 years old boy, but it is purple and pink. so only girlish colors (i thought it would be blue). the apron is nice. but it uses a small velcro to close. so you cannot adjust the size very well. it is recommended for ages 8 and up, but the hat is already to small for my son, who's head is just normal. it only fits my 1 year old, but it is tight on him too. so we cannot use it. and the hat was the reason i bought this set. i would not buy it again and therefore not recommend it."
1,"Anacondas - Awful, Awful, Awful","Bad actors, bad script, and was this some college student-directed flick that got out of the can? PLEASE put it back in. Do yourself a favor and miss it. Ugh."
2,"It looks ok, but...","...""Anacondas - hunt for blablabla..."" is just another one of those many B-monstermovies out there missing style. I'd watch ""Lake Placid"" one more time instead, because of the personality/ties that movie is containing. You don't get ""close"" to any of the characters in ""Anacondas"". And so the story keeps missing something so essential in a story being told until the movie is over. And that's the problem, it's not about how ""real"" it looks or not. The snakes are rather good, but ""Anacondas"" is not thrilling. It didn't shake me one time -and this because of the camera, the editing and the music. The timing simply isn't there. I don't think I'll watch it again..."
4,"SSSSSSSSnakes, Snakes Everwhere!","The first rule of thumb with most nature-run-amok pictures is they have very little logic, but try to over explain itself to justify its star critter. Lucky for us, this is a sequel, so we aren't bothered by such things. A crew sets out to find a rare flower, but find themelves in a real snake pit of trouble. Again, like most sequels this one has to be bigger, and more. So, they are faced with a larger snake, or should I say snakes. They are everywhere! Lots of action, and plenty of goo and gore make this adventure fun. Still there are some attempts to overexplain things to manufacture a plot. But who needs a plot? Come on people! This is not 'Passion.' It's a snake movie. It is suppossed to not make any sense. Sit back, eat popcorn and enjoy."
3,ANACONDAS: WOW! IM SO SCARED....,"My favourite scene in this 90 minute film was the one in which this black dude is cheering the death of an anaconda who was about to attack him. For around 80 seconds the crazily well portrayed scene does it for you. My only wish - that much of the film was like that. The anacondas are animated and seldom really scare the viewer. I think all actors acted well for the role but then the story could have been dragged in the positive direction.I don't think there are many people who would give this movie more than 3 stars owing to it's limited film making process.I also liked the scene with the leech but gee well they could have made a much more disgusting film with a bit more precision.It's certainly better than watching your average dumb parody scary movie. I hate those. Nevermind,watch it if you really are curious or if HBO is showing it.I don't know what to recommend instead of this film.Maybe Jurassic Parks but only newborns havent seen the trilogy.Cheers."
2,Not As Good As The First.....,"I much rather Anaconda as to this film. Although I have to say that this movie is more of a comedy than anything else! Of course, we have the Cool snake but to me, this ""sequel"" doesn't deliver as much suspense as the first and does not have as good a cast. Good special effects but not as good as the first."
1,horrible,"They made this same movie a few years back, with J-Lo and Ice Cube, and I figured a lesson was learned. Apparently not, b/c they released this insult of a film. Same old story; a group of witty young types head out on a trek, this time to find orchids for a pharmaceutical company. Little do they know (hah hah) they are heading straight for a den of godzilla-sized anacondas. The group goes through their rise and fall stages, with certain members turning on each other, blah blah blah. A better ending would have been to throw them all into the pit of steriod-abusing snakes and let the credits roll."
1,and I thought the first Anaconda was bad...,"This movie is extremely mediocre. I would have expected to see this movie on the Sci-Fi channel during prime time. At the end of the movie I found myself asking ""what just happened""? This movie would have done better among viewers if it were to have been MADE for TV. Just look at the amount of availability of this movie, right now I am viewing 187 Used and new starting at $1.25. You cannot GIVE this away. Do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD movie."
2,Movie Fodder Blggh.,"Word of advice to the makers of this movie: If you're going to make a horror movie about anacondas that eat people, please show them eating people. Viewers who choose to see this movie OBVIOUSLY want to see the blood and guts so why hold back on the grusome special effects. Spare us with the moralistic feel good ending. I was hoping everyone in the movie bite the big one and get eaten, except for the monkey, he was soooooooo cute!!!!!!"
3,It was ok,The plot was good. The acting was ok. The special effects were poor computer effects. Low budget. The characters are in search of a orchid that is suspose to give a person ever lasting youth but the problem is the anacondas don't want them do find it Who wins? I'll never tell
3,Oh the agony!!,"Well there are sequels and then there are sequels. The original Anaconda was a good B movie at best, whoever decided to make this next one decided it had to be bigger and better. How? More snakes of course!An expedition is in search of an orchid that only blooms once every seven years. Supposedly (according to their research) this flower can be bottled in pill form to make the Fountain of Youth available to the American public.Well nobody told them that it was the rainy season, so when they show up they can only hire an ex-Special Forces captain. They battle spiders with a paralyzing bite, bad weather, and of course Anacondas in heat.I'm no zoologist, but I am a snake lover and what these snakes do is ridiculous. However, I can enjoy a movie and overlook obvious facts. This is a fun movie with few surprises. The snakes are the real star, so enjoy!!"
4,Anacondas,There is a plant that could give you enternal life if you take one pill a day. These scientist have found it in a African jungle. These snakes have eaten this plant (blood orchid) and the longer they live the bigger they grow. There are six snakes that are at least 50 ft long. I really enjoyed this movie because there are more snakes than the first one. The explorers don't know what kind of trouble there getting into at the end will they survive?
3,"A Wild Ride, ** 1/2 stars","Anacondas isa fun sequel to 1997's Anaconda. It has more action than the first one. Also the film has an enjoyable cast. However it is less scary and suspensful than the first. In addition, the snakes still look fake. But overall its quite enjoyable.Pros: More Action Than The First, Enjoyable Cast, and Watchable.Cons: Less Scary And Suspensful Than The First, and Snakes Still Look Fake.Overall: **1/2 stars"
4,Probably a better film than the first one,"I enjoyed this creature feature. It had more realistic characters than the first Anaconda movie and when you see that mass of snakes swirling around toward the end, it'll give you the creeps.Good acting and special effects, too."
3,Another movie I like that everyone gives a bad review to.,"I thought Anacondas was an okay movie. It certainly wasn't the best movie ever made, but it'll do. In comparison to the first Anaconda movie, this sequel is not bad at all. The first Anaconda movie was a bit slow-moving to me. This one definitely moves along at a much more rapid pace. And like all the other reviews have stated, there are more snakes in this movie than the original. The storyline wasn't much different than the original, with one exception; they were on a mission to find a plant that would save human lives at a higher rate than any other discovery ever made in history. Watch the movie & see if their mission was accomplished or would their ultimate goal of finding this plant be ruined by greed, jealousy or just plain envy. Overall, I enjoyed watching the movie. Not great, but not bad. Enjoy.Larry"
1,You'll be rooting for the snakes!,"I'm hard-pressed to find a more cliche'-ridden piece of dribble from this year's ample crop of cinematic blunders. This is definitely the Gigli of giant creature films - a mostly boringly paced, illogical plot with a cast of characters whose insipid and moronic dialogue had me rooting for the snakes to hurry up and eat them all so the film would end! Really, I could care less for any of them - the morons. At least the first Anacondas film had some eye-candy (Kari Wuhrer and J-Lo, yea!) and the snakes looked somewhat real. This one was just bad. Save your money, save your time and if you want a really good scary film, see Exorcist: The Beginning."
1,Silly Slithering Sequel,"I didn't know that the original Anaconda did so well in the theaters that it deserved a second outing. However, warranted or not, Screen Gems has given us this glorious sequel to an utterly unforgettable giant snake movie.It is what it is, guys. A giant snake movie. There's some sort of plot line about a pharmaceutical company wanting a super rare orchid, but it's still just a giant snake movie. If you liked Boa vs. Python, this one should have you writhing around on the floor in glee.The CG effects are slightly better in this one than in the original, and the best part of this movie involves an anaconda slithering between the legs of our protagonists, just below the surface of the water. The effects were probably the best part of the movie."
1,"please stop, this is painful","Let's see...remember back to about 1997 when J-Lo and Ice Cube were in a movie called ""Anacondas""? A group of young people hook up with a shady jungle guide and encounter oversized anacondas while fighting amongst themselves. Sound familiar? Well, for some reason, this movie has been re-made, and it is even more painful than the original. Horrible acting, completely unrealistic, insulting dialogue, etc etc. I found myself hoping that an anaconda would come along and swallow everyone involved. I didn't recogize a single one of the ""actors"" in this film, except for the little black guy who I think was in 8 mile. Anyway, hopefully this will be the last of the big snake movies....please."
2,I'd like my Refund please...,Horrible! I made my dad watch it with me because I thought it'd be scary. Wrong! Far from scary! More like stupid! Poor acting! The plot soon fades very quickly! My dad fell asleep and I had trouble finishing it. The best part is the last 10 mins. Don't waste your money!
3,"not bad, not bad","I remember seeing this movie before, but I remembered it better than I think it actually was. I think everyone is going to have a different opinion of it, but mine is: An alright movie, which is almost believable, but not as good as the one with Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube."
3,Not all that bad.,"OK for starters, there are no Tigers in Boreno. No Ancondas either. And everyone is way too pretty. And even if there were Anacondas in Boreno. They don't move super snake fast. The dialog is silly and acting is so so. But it was just campy enough to keep my attention. Watch it on Netflix or Hbo sometime. Suspend you common sense for a few hours and enjoy the movie."
1,Do not use with Epson printer,"I tried this in two different Epson printers with the same results - the paper jammed almost every time. Those few times when it did not jam and actually printed, the ink came out so wet that it ran a bit - this was with Epson's premium inks - only the lowest quality print setting (text) came out with out ink puddles. I had bought two packages and have returned them both to Amazon. Very disappointed."
4,One hell of a guitar player.....,"I can't remember why I bought this CD, maybe it was by word of mouth. But it one of those cd's you pull out from time to time to listen to. Many people don't know about Ray Bailey at least the people I've talked to and I'm a guitar player. When I let people here this cd, they are blown away. This man has a very good grip on the blues and a very smooth to edgey playing. The song Bad times, Sad times is really heart felt and there is some serious guitar playing on this song. The whole Cd is good and I hope that Ray will record again. Would love to see in live."
2,"..., its an utter waste of money.","Simply stated, this book borders on useless. If you buy this book and are planning to go to the Baltics, I hope you only want to see the capital cities. There is no mention of the beautiful seaside resort towns, eco-tourism spots which are very popular there, or even the major cities other than Riga, Vilnius, and Tallinn. Similarly, with Russia, don't plan on learning any useful info beyond what's written on Moscow & St. Petes. Even the info which *is* presented is so minimalistic that you it would not aide anyone. Advice such as ""ask a native speaker to help you get a taxi"" isnt exactly helpful, is it? No, and neither are the handdrawn maps. One saving grace with this book: it has good bus information (but the most recent info given is for 1997!). Want a good guide on the Baltics? Check out the ""Lonely Planet"" guide for this region, which I would give at least 4 out of 5 stars. I hope Amazon lets me ""return"" Rick Steve's book."
1,Not for all printers,I received my data port switch and found by reading the box it was not suggested to use with Epson and HP printers. I ordered it because it was a suggested purchase just below the Epson printer description. I am sure it works with many products but be sure your's is included.
1,Not a Belkin Cable,"Purchased this item through a third party seller, fulfilled by amazon. The item I recieved was not a Belkin product at all, instead just a cheap off-brand cable. Even worse, the cables turned out to be non-functional. Led to a disaster for my photography business at an event where I was printing on site. Do not purchase this item from MarginMart."
5,"Great Cable, Belkin Strikes Again","I've always seen high-quality products from Belkin, and this one is no exception. It is a high-quality USB cable at a great price, by a leading computer accessory company. An extra bonus is the lifetime warranty!"
4,Just what I required!,"It's a shame that some printer manufacturers don't provide USB cables to connect to computers. This cable was just the perfect one, even though it was a tad too short. But the quality is very good. Cables are thick and the joints are sturdy."
4,Hi Speed Cable,"When HP didn't include the correct USB cable to my new printer, I shopped at Amazon and found what I needed for a reasonable price. It worked and for a great deal. I recommend it."
4,USB CABLE,"After problem with seller mispackaging and sending wrong cable, they promptly sent the correct item. Good price and service, product as advertised."
4,Works as advertised... however 6 feet does not go far,This cable works great. The only suggestion I have is to probably go a little longer (10 feet +)
2,What is It?,"I had no idea what this cable was because I found it in my drawer one day, I thought it was the VCR cable and I tried to hook it up to the TV and VCR one day and nothing happened except the reception on my TV went bland and empty."
4,shoelace,"One time, My shoelace broke and I used this cable to fix it. It worked ok but its kind of hard to tie."
5,USB printer cable,"Great product, excellent price and no shipping cost. You shouldn't have to pay $20 at the store for this. It seemed to take longer to receive in the mail than anticipated. I didn't receive an email from the product distributor as to when it was shipped. Although it did arrive on time. I would buy from them again."
2,Not happy,It fell apart before i even got to use it...not good. Then talking back and fourth with customer servise was like a sharp stick in the eye..
2,"MONSTER brand was not available, so I picked this.","MONSTER brand cables are king in terms of quality. In the world of cables, there are unshielded, shielded, and super-shielded cables to ensure a clean transmission of data, protecting against ""line noise"" and other outside electrical interference. - The only reason I bought this BELKIN F3U133-06 is because the 6ft MONSTER brand was not available. BELKIN is great at marketing, but when I opened the package I found a FLIMSY little cable that looked it should only be used as an emergency backup cable. It is obvious that the BELKIN brand is predicated on marketing and NOT QUALITY. - This product may work OK for now, but who knows for how long."
2,Product does not meet my need,"Product was advertised as accessory under a different product- kodack easyshare Ez740.This made me buy a wrong product tjat is not going to serve any useful purpose to me, time and money wasted,"
5,fair price; flexible cable,clean connections and flexible cable. no reason topay 2x or more for any other cable that does justthe same.
3,Short cable,"It was advertised as ""six-feet"". Not sure on how they measured this, but it was 3 feet short. Fortunately, it was suitable for my purposes by a few inches. If I have to move my printer another foot then I would have to get myself a 6 foot cable."
3,Dorothy Returns,"A book for young readers that came out a few years ago called Dorothy Of Oz written by Roger S. Baum, the great-grandson of L. Frank Baum. This was published by Toto Too, Inc., who have printed also printed several of his other Oz books, one of which wasLion Of Ozthat was also turned into amade-for-DVD animated movie. Dorothy Of Oz, is a semi-direct sequal to the first few Oz books. In it, Dorothy is called back to Oz by Glinda to stop a Jester who has been possessed by the power of the wand of the Wicked Witch of the West, and using it to turn people in to china dolls. Dorothy sets out with Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin Man to find Glinda and Ozma for help. Along the way, they befriend the princess of the China Country, Wiser the owl, and the living tugboat Tugg. It's a good story for kids, and the book has some wonderful illustrations by Elizabeth Miles. The great thing is though that a full-length CGI movie is in the works."
2,Son of Flubber needs a little stretching!,"It's nice to see a fair priced 2-disc set of these Disney favorites. However, they still didn't get Son Of Flubber right! It should be widescreen, not full screen. Is anybody at Disney listening?"
3,Absent Minded indeed,"One criticism which you may think I am crazy for, I liked the movie better in re-colorized. But the first movie was decent. I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars. The second movie, the plot is so bizarre I don't really get it. So I give it 2 stars, it's a poor quality movie. They blew the story so far out there that the plot was confusing. I held out to get both movies in one, had I known Son Of Flubber not so good, I would have paid a little less for just the first movie."
3,Black & White,"I Like the old movies, but was expecting them to be in color format as was listed in product discription.They were black and white not color."
4,The Absent Mined Professor/Son of flubber,If you want to go back in time to the good old days .Well this are good dvd 's to do it with. You can watch with your kids and not have to worry about bad thing being said or done. And they are well done. They are good stories in have a ok plot to them.
3,not the greatest.,"I have had better sloughing creme from avon. It smells nice, and does work some but didnt just peel off like some of the reviewers said. the price was great and it smells wonderful. It does make my feet softer, but doesnt slough off the skin."
5,great product,"I was so glad to find this product again. The large container lasts so long and gets rid of dry skin on hands and elbows/feet, just anywhere.The transaction was smooth and speedy. No problems encountered and very pleased to be using this product again."
3,"Cute, but not soft at all","Althought I didn't want a theme for my dd's room, I let her get this bed set when we put her in a ""big girl bed."" I sure wish I would have felt the sheets before I bought them. They are like paper towels. Not the slightest bit soft. You can tell the minute you feel them they are of true quality. I don't know what the thread count is, but it couldn't be much. No amount of fabric softener in the world will make them soft and comfy. They feel yucky. Bummer, because they are kinda cute."
1,Too Cute and Too Scratchy,"Even though I read the other reviews before purchasing this sheet set...I bought a ""lemon"". These sheets are adorable but I even used 2 different fabric softeners trying to make them comfortable and soft to sleep on but it didn't work. I will be putting these brand new sheets in my garage sale. Also, I didn't notice a thread-count listed so that should've been a heads up right there. And, if I wouldn't want to sleep on them than I'm certainly not going to make my little girl suffer through sleepless nights on these sheets either."
2,Why?,"Let me start by saying that I am a Dipset fan, but this cd was a total disappointment. First off, it only has 10 songs... and out of those, I only bump like 3. Jim, what were you thinking? It's so last minute... the production isn't all that. It's like he had three good songs that he wanted to put out, and rushed the other 7. This album was a mistake. Hustler's P.O.M.E, loved it! Besides the fact that Christmas is over, I advise you not to purchase this album because it's a waste (of time and money.) Sorry Jim, better luck next time.---Pryncez"
1,Love Dipset Hate the X_mas album,Love Dipset Hate the X_mas album. Is garbage!! I can't stand this album!! I bet everyone in NY agrees w this statement! This Album gets half_star out of 5!! P.s: Bx stand up!!
4,Fantastic,I am a huge Romanov fan and never get enough of the Romanov tale and the nights at Tsarskoe Selo with Lavish balls. This shows how the Russian Revolution erased the Tsars forever. From the Family life to the First World War and the brutal assassination of the last ruling family of Imperial Russia.
3,"Nice, but probably better for a ladies shirt","I bought these for my husband and they are really tiny. I think they would look great with a ladies french cuff shirt, but they just seem very wimpy for a man. They did ship as promised - in a nice box and on time."
1,Rev 13:3 was fulfilled in the Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor?,"I started this book and gave up after reading the author's claim that God told him Rev 13:3 was fulfilled - the ""wound of the beast"" was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Dec 7, 1941. Yeah right.......... If like me, you couldn't possibly accept this interpretation, don't bother with this book."
3,Original but not essential.,"Huizinga illustrates with numerous examples out of all sort of civilizations that culture first appears under the form of play. The first forms of culture are played. He finds his examples in as different fields as jurisdiction, art, poetry, battle ...I agree that play was certainly influential or important for certain aspects of cultural life, but not for essential points like politics, exercise of power or distribution of wealth within a society.This book is not in the same class as his other more known book 'The Autumn of the Middle Ages'.He makes an important remark in his diatribe against Carl Schmitt, whom he reproaches his wrong point of view. Schmitt founds his jurisdictional work on the principle of 'friend-foe', in other words on war not on peace."
5,Dog Training,"I have found this book to very helpful in training my dogs. Most dog training manuals just cover the basics like sit, stay and heel. This book covers problem solving. Using Amy Ammens methods I have been able to correct bad behavior in my dogs and in turn have made their lives more fun and enjoyable. Working with the dogs is great fun and exercise for me too."
5,Conflict of Laws (Hornbook 3rd Ed),"My book is a brand new 3rd edition Hornbook. I don't know who wrote the review for the second (the info is good) but the third is newer, is hardback, and doesn't have a disk."
2,Surprisingly Worthless,"It's curious that this book is touted as ""the bible of portfolio design."" Although it passes as an intro, its value drops off the face of the Earth afterwards.What ""Portfolio Design"" is, is a reproduction of outdated portfolios and examples of templates you can find in any page making tool. It lacks any meaty, substantial analysis you'd expect to find in a ""bible"" of portfolio design:-nothing on the theories behind print design.-no explanation on the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of presenting your work.-little analysis on proper organization of a portfolio.-insufficient info on photography, cropping, margins, etc.If you've never put a portfolio together, you might get some use out of it in the initial stages of your portfolio. Once you iterate to a certain level, however, ""Portfolio Design"" makes a better coaster than a guide. Advice: buy it used, if you buy it."
2,disappointed,"Given this book was about presentation and promotion I was suprised to find the reproduction very poor, as if it was a photocopy in some parts. The paper selection was poor and some of the photographs of works approaching unreadable. The advice and text was good. Very, very diasappointed and in fact gave the book away."
2,Portfolio Design,Images mostly black and white and of poor quality. Computer portfolios also need updating. Over all this book is quite dated
4,Helpful,"The book was really helpful in terms of layout and organization of a portfolio as a whole. It was more specific than anything I have read before, which I found helpful because I feel like so much writing about making a portfolio says that you should make it look nice, but that it just depends on each individual person without much concrete information. It was a good resource and I felt more confident putting together a portfolio because of it. There is, however, a good amount of information that is now outdated. Most of the book assumes that you are making a print portfolio and only new chapters added for later editions acknowledge the use of the computer. I think that some of the material in the early chapters could benefit from having this information present throughout the whole thing. At the very least, the book does provide a lot of examples of good portfolios and seeing other people's work made me realize more clearly what I wanted my own portfolio to be like."
3,It seems outdated.,"Make no mistake. This is one book written thoroughly about the process of making portfolio. I will give credit for that effort.While some texts and advice are useful, however, there are a lot of written information that seems common sense e.g.) what is portfolio and why it is important.In fact, it is ironic that I find this book itself poorly illustrated despite that it is about layout and organization. For example, insertions of images are not well coordinated with the locations of the texts. Quotes are randomly inserted. The images are 99% black and white.Only comes useful is the analysis on the featured portfolios by students.Here you can find some principles and reasons on why these examples are successful portfolio.If you are totally unfamiliar with design and layout, get this book.If you are already in design field, you may find this book not very special."
5,If you're an architecture student you have to buy this!!,"This book will get you accepted in the best schools!!I have read more than one book on portfolio design for architects, listened to many words of advice on the subject but Howard Linton's book was really the best resource I've ever had.Other books are just vague and annoyingly general, they don't tell you how to organize yourself and your work and they don't discuss the many details you have to bear in mind and go through, or worse still have no lists of the dos and don'ts! On the other hand, Portfolio design by Mr. Linton does all that and much more.I recommend it to all architecture students and professionals."
2,Not that good,"Compared to other ""Let's Read and Find Out"" books, this one was dull, had dull historical facts that would not appeal to a youngster."
4,Classical Mechanics still has some life left,"With all the to-do about Quantum Mechanics, one might suspect that Classical Mechanics is a dead field, with all the interesting problems solved.Not quite! Classical Mechanics has a storied past, dating back to Lagrange and Newton. Mathematically, the book gives you the important historical papers. But, just as importantly, the editors have furnished recent papers that give you an idea of the cutting edge, circa 1987, when this book was assembled.There are discussions about chaotic behaviour in various dynamical ensembles, and about the onset to chaos. Very much a new thing in the 1980s. And, indeed, with still much to be explored.The papers also hail from a variety of fields. Particle accelerators, plasma, solid state, chemistry and fluid mechanics. Gives you a good feel for the current diversity of ways to apply your research."
1,"Serial to PS/2? No, just wiring","Don't expect this device to work for all types of mice. After you've got one, as you may find soon if your mouse does not come with a PS/2-Serial switch, then this device means money wasted. No internal hardware, except some wires connecting the 9 pin serial connector to the 6pin Mini DIN connector is all this adapter does. If your mouse hardware interface goes out serial only, then this device is not what you need!"
2,Basically pointless,"This is just a USB to Mini-USB cable. If you have a digital camera, you probably have one of these laying around. This is not specific for the Garmin GPS."
1,"Works good, but you probably already have one.","This is just a standard usb ""Mini-B plug"" - I bought it alongside my Garmin Nuvi 1350T GPS, but I should have just waited. I already have two such wires, one that came with a digital camera and another with a hard drive.If you are not sure if you have one or not, do your research into the different types of USB connectors and see if you have one that looks like a ""Mini-B plug"" - it could save you the price of this product.That said, this wire is high quality and works well. I have kept mine and it will be useful to me. I just know I wouldn't have coughed up the cash for it if I had known then what I know now."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,What else can you say about a USB cable? It works. There are no color or style options to consider.
3,USB Cable,"Not sure if I should have given 5 stars... it's just hard to say you love an USB Cable, but it does the job for sure."
1,Garmin did not recognize,"The Garmin did not recognize the cable, therefore it wold not work.Will use the cable for something else if I need it."
4,does the job,"fits the USB connector on the garmin and connects it to the computer with no problems. It's a great replacement, since we lost the original one"
1,Garmin USB Cable,To me the seller misrepresented the product. I could not get it to work. Simple connection but nothing happened. Amazon gave me a full refund. I thank Amazon for backing up the consumer. I would not buy from the seller or recommend them.
1,USB cord,I did not order this product I tried to and to register my GPS but it didn't happen. nor did it come with my GPS
4,The cable of need,This cable was to download new maps to a few GPS units I own. Now I have the Snowmobile paths on one and the DNR lake charts on the other. Perfect for what I needed and delivered face and professionally.
4,OEM,This cable has the same order number as the actual cable sold by Garmin and costs much less. It does not have the black cylinder like the Garmin has.
5,Garmin USB cable,"This cable was cheap and functional, but it proved unreliable. When I used it to attach my GPS to the iMac, the computer kept thinking the device had been disconnected and giving me the warning not to disconnect without ejecting. When I replaced it with one by GE (also very cheap), the problem went away."
3,"Really, this isn't included with the charger cradle?",It seems that Garmin has taken a page out of the Apple playbook (every device needs a new charger cable)
2,Didn't work for me,"I was unable to establish a connection between my GPS unit and my laptop, so this item didn't do what I needed it for. It may be the fault of the GPS unit itself but I really can't tell."
2,NOT what it claims,"I think this cable works fine for a MINI usb to usb cable. Looks to be resonably good quality. It is listed and labeled as a MICRO usb to usb cable,which it dfinitly is not. DO NOT ORDER IF YOU NEED A MICRO cable!"
3,Just another USB cable,"If planing to use your GPS for a long time, then I recomend this cable.I used it just once to download a free upgrade for Nuvi 200. Unless you enjoy downloading stuff and paying for it, then this is the USB cable you'd been looking for."
1,not recommended,"First of all,I ordered the Garmin cable and never arrived when was suppose to. They did try to remedy the problem by sending me another cable and a bluetooth and the bluetooth is defective (took to verizon after i couldnt get a charge). Do alot of people get stuff that isnt what they expected or is just me? Ive ordered black inkjet and hoping its not only half full."
1,Cable didn't work,I'm probably the only person where this cable didn't work. Was trying to avoid buying the more expensive one from Garmin. The cable fit so I have no clue. I was swayed by all the other reviews saying the cable did work.
1,Ruined the Nuvi outlet,"I bought the wire to update my maps on the Garmin Nuvi. It did that but when I tried to use the machine in the car, the unit kept shutting off after a few seconds. Turns out, upon looking closely, that the original plug no longer fits properly. Something was distorted when this USB plug was inserted. The Garmin no longer charges because the charging plug will not stay in the socket; it has to be physically held in place. It's kind of difficult to drive and keep holding the original wire into the socket. Very unhappy with this product and now facing a repair or replacement bill."
1,"Save your money, buy a cheaper, generic cable...",This is just a USB to Mini-USB cable and is not specific to the Garmin. You can find cheaper Mini-USB cables (aka Mini-B cables) right here on Amazon.com. Save some cash!
2,Nothing fancy here,"It is ludicrous that the manufacturer of a GPS device that requires computer updates does not include in the purchase package a USB cable, but Garmin does not. The one available online is nothing fancy -- just a simple cable with standard connectors. If you can find one less expensive that does not carry the Garmin name, buy it."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE!,"I received my ""Garmin USB Cable""...it is NOT compatible with my Garmin Nuvi 255w! Do not order this unless you are absolutely sure it is compatible. The generic title for the product is indeed misleading."
4,"Good, but................","I am pretty sure this is just a mini USB cable which amazon sells for $2. Yes this cable says Garmin on it, but I think you could save $12 if you just use a mini USB cable."
1,Wrong mini USB terminal,"I requested a Garmin cable for Nuvi 2360 LT and what I received did not fit the unit, so I had to purchase another cable from another source. Very disappointed!"
2,will not work for map upgrades,"Reading the other reviews on here suggested that it would work for upgrading my map on my GPS device, a Nuvi 2450. I contacted Garmin customer service and they couldn't figure it out. I ended up deleting all my contacts and restoring the factory setting, and finally a technician mentioned that the data cable should be a MICTRO cable and plug directly into the GPS unit, not into the cradle. So I bought yet another cable, but this time it was the right one and then the upgrade went through. So this was a waste of money for me."
1,What??,I really don't understand this cable. I bought it to update my maps and I still have not been able to. It's not user friendly at all and I will be complaining to the company. Pass on this.
5,Garmin USB cable.,I lost the cable that came with my Garmin and needed a replacement. This USB cable met my needs very well and I was able to update my maps.
1,Did not work,The cable did not work with my Garmin NuVi 255w. Not happy with it. I will go directly to Garmin to get a new cable.
4,"Garmin USB cable, sans software","Garmin Beanbag for Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units (Beanbag Only - Mount not Included)The Garmin cable worked well; however when ordering the Garmin USB cable, Amazon's description showed 3.5"" disk software (old Tech)included, it was even printed on the packing slip, however NO software (of any type) was included with the Garmin USB cable. This is why I gave it only 4 stars!Warren"
5,Great pens,"I've been using these for several months now, and I absolutely love them. No bleed-through even on notebook paper, dark writing, and they don't fade in and out after a while like some other pens I've used before. The ink comes out easily without pressing hard like cheap Bic-type pens, which is great when you write a lot. I have no problem with smearing. I'm particularly impressed that even now, after lots of use, I notice very little difference in how dark the ink is or how nice it looks. I'm sticking with these from now on for sure."
4,writes well and comfortable,"If you want a bunch of high-end cheap pens, and you like a higher ink flow then this pen is for you.I have moved on to drawing pens, which have a much cleaner line and dry quickly. Pigma Micron are my old/new favorite."
5,"Writes upside down, or nearly, too!","All the other 5 stars have extolled the dark ink, smooth flow and other great characteristics of these pens. I just want to add that I do crosswords in ink, in bed, and these pens do NOT stop writing when the point is higher than the barrel. I remember the story of picking the Fisher pen that was developed to write in space in the sixties: I bet this one would do the trick! Absolutely the best pen I have ever owned. And yes, hard to find in the previously wide distribution so hopefully not on the slate for discontinuing!"
5,"IF YOU'RE A LEFTY, THESE ARE A MUST HAVE!!",these are the very best pens. i use these and nothing else. i'm a lefty and have had a lot of trouble with other pens. since lefty's hands follow their writing the ink often smears all over the paper and their hand. or it stamps onto the hand and then re-stamps all over the paper making it look messing and unreadable. these pens are the very best for lefties. the ink dries so quickly that they never smear or stamp no matter how fast you write. the grip also stops your hand from sliding down the pen which is also a problem for lefties. i have used nothing but these pens for the last 10 years and i will continue to use them until they stop making them. (probably longer since i'm stocking up just in case).
4,Style,i thought the pens were the click style. My error for not reading close enough. Read all fine print before buying. Seller was great sent out timely
5,PENTEL GEL STICK,"I am left handed and have trouble with some gel pens. The ink smears as I write. No so with the Pentel Gel Stick. I would highly recommend it for any left-handed person who prefers to use a gel pen.Pentel EnerGel Liquid Gel Stick Roller Ball Pen, Medium Point, 0.70 mm, Silver Barrel, Black Ink 12-Count (BL17-A)"
5,These pens are the BOMB!!,"I'm a small time collector of fountain pens, and I'd rather use one of these than my Mont Blanc anyday. My wife and I buy these by the pack and hardly use anything else. The ink flows from these perfectly like a fine-tip fountain pen without skipping OR blotching, and, unlike so many other gel pens, it dries on the page almost instantly.Just don't use them on something glossy like a postcard. They will smear. But that's no different from any other gel pen, or fountain pen for that matter.Well worth your investment, this is a fine writing instrument indeed!"
4,Pentel EnerGel liquid Gel Stick Roller Ball Pen,"I have used the pentel pens before and I love them! These pens have a smooth writing style. For some odd reason, these pens no longer are sold in stores. I'm glad I was able to find them in Amazon.com!"
5,The (next) best pen I've ever used!,"This is a GREAT pen. The only product I would rate better are the retractables from TUL. TUL are better only in that the diameter of the barrel is larger, which works better for people with larger hands or long fingers. I like the Pentel product for the price (cheaper than TUL!), and I think the Pentel pens have a higher capacity ink reservoir (more ink, less money, it's great!)."
5,Item being reviewed: Rolling Writer,"Good Pen to write with, but sometimes the metal ball comes out and it doesn't work after that. Despite the fact that the pen's metal balls were remarkably cheap, the Pen is surprisingly good.Ballpoint pens are made to order in mass quantities so the quality of pen components are not checked during all manufacturing stages.All in all, the Pen is flawed but uniformly good. Admittedly it would have been stronger if they'd followed the original pen manufacturing process more closely."
1,product what I wanted- packaging bad,Product was what I wanted but the packaging was bad. Lost one of the pens in the shipment. Box that pen package was placed in collapsed in mail and opened. Sent e-mail to amazon but did not get response. Will not order this item from them again. So one star is for the package and delivery not the product.
1,"Worthless as AC Adapter, Great Fire Starter","I bought this adapter, against my better IT judgment, hoping to save a buck. This is made in China, shoddy -wires became exposed quickly, and loosened. If you need genuine parts get them. Not worth the potential fire hazard as my unit today, actually started sparking."
3,same problem as original equipment,the connection at the laptop tends to break over time - this was the 2nd charger I used - not great
4,in need of help hp!,"I purchased this HP cord and when I got it, it didn't work. The purchasee was so nice and wonderful and sent me a replacement and the wires are coming out but with a little tape it's still working... Now in need of HP battery for my computer. Will work with people who are willing to work for you... Thanks Thunder!"
2,"Works well, but gets VERY hot","Bought this as a replacement when the tip broke off my original, it works fine however this charger gets extremely hot, possibly burning someone with soft skin (ie, a baby) I will probably end up buying one to replace it before too long."
4,Adapter,Adapter works great with my laptop. The size fit perfectly and I don't always need it in hand since I just bought the replacement battery. I would have wished that the adapter cord was a bit longer to extend further but the current length works.
3,adequate replacement for laptop cord,"Bought this cord a while ago.The first one was a little short and burned out within 2 weeks. Emailed the seller, he was very understanding and sent me a new one with a longer cord so I don't have to sit right on top of the power outlet. The only thing about the cord I don't like is that it doesn't plug into the laptop perfectly, it is kind of loose. But it works. No complaints about the seller though. He responded very quickly to my e-mails in trying to replace the burned out cord and mailed the replacement cord pretty quickly."
4,Nice Brain for Zombies,"If your pet zombie is in need of a brain to play with but you don't want the mess of a real one, this one does fine."
2,dummy brain,"Actually 2 1/2 stars- It is a bit smaller than expected-usable BUT not for my original intention-the ""Jello mold"" version size is better-detail & glow in the dark feature saved it from being a return-Quick & free s/h from seller a PLUS"
5,"I couldn't put it down. I have read it twice, and loved it.",It left me with the impression that I had just left a very private family get together where we spent the time reading the private diary of a family member. The reader was able to become immersed into the book almost immediately. The second reading and I was still intrigued and fascinated. I think I would recommend that this be a required reading for all who are studying to become social workers or psychologists. It is definitely a wonderful book for any book club.
2,ALAK Melody Ranch,This is a big disappointment as I already had the Melody Ranch DVD ofthese singing and no where did it say this was a compilation of theMelody Ranch program. Just up front this is a program of Melody Ranch.
1,Unusable for Chevy HHR,This kit can not be used for the Chevy HHR. It will not hold a double din radio in place. It's a waste of money if you're using for the HHR.
1,A waste of money,"Ashley Simpson is in the cohort of ham-fisted celebrities without clout. It's reflected in her CD and her public montre. Worst off her CD is not good, glad I was able to listen to a good friend's copy. Remember her blaming the band on SNL-how pathetic! How in the world can we even deem her a performing artist?We thank Amazon for allowing us to voice our opinions: I lieu of this poor rating I would reccomend the following items via Amazon instead: Norah Jones-Come Away with Me; Any Annie Lennox Album"
1,Not Good,"I HAVE LISTENED TO THE ENTIRE ALBUM AND I AM VERY GLAD I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY ON IT. When I first heard Peices of Me, i loved it and i couldnt wait for the album to come out, but now I wish it never did...i really think that ashlee has a terrible voice...if you watch her tv show, at all the rehearsals and when she sings on that show...she's absolutely horrible and can't hit one note right, which shows how much editing and fixing up they do to an artist's album to make it sound good. I just didn't like it."
3,Could be better,"This album shows promise, in all aspects you can see ashlee's talent, and you can also see how she has not developed enough. The music is wrong for her type of voice, and she really has not grown into her voice, at the oddest times her voice seems to crack as though she were a teenaged boy. While it is better than britney spears lets say, it could be much better, but don't believ all this harder/rockier nonsense you've heard, this is just pure pop. Just because you have a darker voice and should be singing in a different style doesn't mean it is that style. It is by no means possible a 'rock' album, if this is rock, than so are the backstreet boys. Take my advice wait for her next try at an album and if it doesn't come well atleast you can say you didn't waste you money like some people will."
2,My band did it!,Hey Ash! Take some blame for what YOU did. Dont blame it on your band! Anyway let's just say this. YOU LIP-SYNC!!!
1,Want real music? Get Jill Scott,"Tired of fake hackneyed wannabe music?Tired of phony manufactured thinktanked artists?Tired of that sorry sound that seems to be always coming through your speakers?Then drop acts like non-talents Britney Spears & this Ashlee Simpson & get REAL living breathing talent like Jill Scott.Type Jill Scott into the search engine, listen to those samples from her albums & watch the hills come alive with the sound of TRUE music.You'll be glad you did.John Lucas"
5,Hang onto them!,"I have used these pens for a long time and they are the greatest. Can no longer find them in stores, only online. When anyone borrows my pen they always say ""That's a great pen!"" Careful, they may not always give it back!"
5,The Best Gel Pen Available,"I made a project of checking out all the gel pens in stores where they were sold - 3 office supply stores, a few grocery stores, a few drug stores, and 3 big box stores. I tried out the pens right in the store when possible. The Zebra Jimnie was only available at one store, so it was a rarity. The ironic thing is, it was the very best of all the gel pens that I tested.Since then, I have bought and used up at least two boxes of medium point (24 pens) and have never had a single problem. The pens never skip; they write extremely evenly, darkly and the medium is the right thickness. They have a simply-shaped rubber area for your fingers that is close to the tip of the pen, which is what I prefer for the best control. They have a cap which is best if you plan on carrying the pen in a pocket.If you are looking for the best gel pen and appreciate the characteristics I've mentioned, you really should buy these pens while they're still available!"
4,"Nice pens, great price","With only limited use of my right hand I'm always searching for a pen that's comfortable to hold, that writes smoothly and has blue ink (my fav color). These pens ""fit the bill""."
5,pretty cool,"had gotten the necklace to go with the bracelet and earrings. my daughter loves them all. the beads are durable, colorful, and the whole set is really pretty."
4,Not fast or easy,"This book gives detailed instructions, but none of them are fast or simple. After buying the book I decided to take my chairs to a professional."
4,Chair Recaning,This book is well written and explained the process and history of chair caning very well.
4,Bought as a gift,I bought this item as a gift for my son-in-law. He liked the detail of the illustrations and seemed pleased overall with the book.
5,everything you need in one book,"Photos, detailed lists for what you need, step by step, and helpful hints. I am a beginner and have found everything I need to know. My father recommended this book and he has been canning and repairing furniture for over 50 years."
3,Not the Best Book on the Subject,"Beautiful photographs and good information about the history of the craft and how rattan cane is processed. It's a nice book to look at. However, if you want to learn how to weave your own chair seats with cane, rush, or flat reed, you would do better to buy the author's original book on the subject, The Caners Handbook by Jim Widess and Bruce Miller. Here you will find the details of how to weave any chair seat or back, and how to solve the tricky problems. The photographs are black and white, but the level of detail is far better. Although The Caners Handbook is out of print, it is readily available used on amazon.com."
3,"Good music,but not enough","The program is very well done the music is great, but it is only 23 minutes long.Seven songs and it's over. The price was right, but i've not seen a dvd or vhs so brief."
1,Incorrect Item Description,"I love these pens and have difficulty finding them where I live, so I end up ordering them online. I was THRILLED to my very core to see the hugely discounted price for a dozen pens, and placed and order for two units. The pens were shipped the same day the order was placed and I received them the very next day. HOWEVER, instead of receiving TWO DOZEN pens, I received TWO pens and paid nearly $6 in shipping. I would not have made the purchase for just two pens. The item description is VERY misleading, and the price was changed within the 24 hours that I ordered the pens and received them. Buyer beware."
1,No steam + poor design,"This iron is poorly designed and does not deliver steam as advertised.1. Iron does not have a manual steam option. All you can do is fill it with water and put the steam setting on max - and this barely produces steam, you can't force more steam bursts.2. The hinge for the handle is weak. It slips and folds down while you try to use the iron and is flimsy at best.3. If you are buying it to travel think about weight - it is far heavier than other models.4. It is nice that it has a converter built in - but I never used it b/c I would never take this piece of junk with me on a trip!"
3,Travel Pro Iron,Works fine. Just requires some patience and don't expect to have perfectly pressed clothes. Just gets rid of the more obvious wrinkles.
2,not nearly as good as its predecessor!,"I bought this as a replacement for the X10, which had been inside a suitcase that was stolen from me. I found this one much more difficult to use, primarily because the handle, which rises up from the top rather than folding up from the side, doesn't lock securely in the up position. Frequently while using the iron the handle will partially collapse, either on its own or because I bumped the release button (which is all to easy to do). This jerks the iron, pinches fingers, and makes me fear burning the clothing or even myself.Furthermore, the cord of the X10 could be wrapped around the collapsed iron when not in use for easy storage in its box, but the shape of this one makes wrapping the cord unwieldy and does not allow it to fit in the box this way...so one must figure out how to fold and stuff the cord in each time one puts it away."
1,poor product,i wonder what is wrong with this product.it did not work when connected. i am wondering whether 60 volts volts option was to be changed to 120.but it ended up also damaging my universal adopter.
2,Disappointing,"The toy looks good, but there is no power in the arm's ability to send a projectile farther than a foot or two. It looks like a catapult, but it doesn't behave like one."
4,A great accessory for imaginative play,"I recently purchased a Melissa and Doug Deluxe Princess Castle for my 4.5-year-old preschooler as she loves stories about castles,princesses, dragons and knights. The castle was awesome [I have posted a video review of it] and I decided to get a couple of accessories to go with it. The catapult by Schleich was a delightful surprise. I expected a little miniature catapult, but this is nice-sized and fun to play with. I do agree that the mechanics of the catapult is not 100% impressive, one does have to find a projectile to place in the catapult and manually flick it, but other than that it does work well. I plan to get a couple of other accessories to go with the green dragon, knight, and Feya the fairy which I also purchased. The Schleich line of fantasy figures makes for great imaginative play. Now, my little one can actually 'live' the stories and not just read about them or view the stories on screen."
4,"Fully manual, comes apart easily.","We purchased this for our 3 year old son, expecting a larger version of an existing catapult. This one does not have a release lever, you have to manually push down the boom to raise the catapult. It comes apart very easily, and is easy to re-assemble, it's a great quality piece to add to the medieval fun."
1,Thin...more like microscopic!,This ring was a total let down. It was VERY thin and caught on everything that I wore. $26 is way too much money to pay for this ring.
1,Not what I expected!,I like to do carnival themes and I thought that this would be a cute corn dog maker to go with those nostalgic afternoons. I have used this once. It is more work than necessary and I didn't love that the heated surface wasn't protected. I wasn't at all impressed. I think that I was expecting this to be more like a deep fryer and it isn't.I think that this is a very attractive piece just not as functional as I would have liked.
4,science lesson,This is a picture book fairy tale much like the story of Sleeping Beauty. Albert and Humphrey and two brothers who have been invited to the Princess Briar Rose's birthday party. They think it will be boring and they don't want to go. Their parents make them anyway. While at the party a mean witch cast a spell that makes everyone sleep for 100 years. Albert and Humphrey are the first to wake up and go looking for a price to break the spell by kissing the princess. Instead of a price they find a scientist named Daniel Bernoulli. He used his invention of the flying machine to get back to the palace and break the spell.The scientist in the book was based on a real person named Daniel Bernoulli. In the back of the book is a page of authors notes. In the notes she tells more about the scientist and his work.I would recommend this book to kids ages 7-10. The book is a picture book but there is a lot to learn from it.
2,Not helpful,"Not helpful. Sorry. this ""method"" including ""twirling"" your hands, does not make sense to me. And I don't see any PGA players or long drive hitters using it. Maybe I am just missing it. A good hit-it-long book is Sean Fister's ""Long Drive Bible"", which is worth buying if only for the chapters on ""The Ten Commandments of Distance."""
3,its ok,"as a read, almost like a manual then a book, kinda dry to read, but has alot of good drills and really breaks the swing down"
1,Skip this one ...,"Same author as above . A waste of time and money . Poorly written , illustrated , as well as info ""they/he"" is trying to present .Carbon copy of ""21st Century Golf Swing "" ... lousy ."
2,pass on it,The book really is about a few players that this method worked.Not really relevant to the golf swing as it should be.
1,Now obsolete swing theory or proved not efficient,Dan's student Jaacob Bowden's swing now doesn't look like what he demonstrated in this book or Dan's DVD. They changed the swing. There was no substantiation for the swing other than Jaacob. And now Jaacob's swing is changed by Dan again. Why learn obsolete swing?
5,The only way to play golf!,"I've been playing golf for 40 years and as I've gotten into my 50s I've lost distance and the game was becoming difficult. I was about ready to give up the game when I discovered Dan's book. I've been working on the swing as taught in the book for about 5 months now and the difference is amazing. Driver from weak 225 yards to booming 275 in the air. 150 yard club from 6 iron to 9 iron. This swing's release makes accuracy easy. This swing is very easy on the body. His follow-on book ""The 21st Century Golf Swing"" expands on the swing principles. If you want to get good at this game, get the books and DVDs and spend some time! You will be delighted."
4,Hindu & Muslim Mysticism,"(from a seller's review): ""Hindu and Muslim Mysticism"" by R.C. Zaehner, (various dates of issue), 879 pages. Author analyzes the various forms of Hindu and Muslim mysticism. Taken from eight lectures delivered in May 1959 at the School of Oriental and African Studies in the University of London. This work traces the development of mystical thought during the formative periods of the Hindu and Muslim traditions and provides comparisons between the two streams of mysticism. The author's discussion includes the classical Upanishads, the Yogasutras, the Bhagavad-Gita and their commentaries. His study of the Islamic tradition includes the Monastic revolution introduced by Abu Yazid, which the author traces to the influence of Indian thought and the later writings of Ghazali."
3,Not bad,"There are some good parts on the DVD, but I was hoping for more live performances. In addtion, the live performances audio quality was not the best. Still, I'm glad I bought it."
1,Lame as lame can be,"This book is unbelievably poor. Even for complete newbies, it's ploddingly elementary, disorganized and repetitive. And if you're already in the biz and looking to brush up for the exam, it will make you nuts. The review questions are matching or fill-in-the-blank, whereas the MS questions are generally multiple choice. The so-called labs and demos on the CD-ROM are comically useless. If you're a newbie, try Sybex. If you already pretty much know the real stuff and just want to get ready for the exam, get O'Reilly's MCSE: The Core Exams in a Nutshell."
2,I found it confusing!,"it is not a bad book, but first of all it is not enough for passing the test.Second the book is not really clear and the information sometimes contradicts other informaton on the same book. For a beginner like me it wasn't a good book, and hence I dont recommend it."
2,Insufficient to pass the exam unless you are fortunate,"I passed but only because I also read Exam Cram and Que. This book was simply inadequate. To pass using it as the only study tool, you would have to be very fortunate in the selection of exam questions you were asked to answer. The back cover says ""...you get complete preparation for Microsoft ... exam 70-058."" My feeling is that this statement is far from being true.Its also aggravating, as other reviewers have noted, that the sample questions are generally trivial compared to those appearing on the exam itself."
1,An incrediably poor job from Microsoft Press; AVOID!,"I purchased the new, 2nd Edition of this title. First, the book is not all that well written, with typos and careless errors, and more importantly, content is only so-so. Many available study guides from major publishers that I have perused are a better choice; certainly no worse. However, I bought the title for the alternative learning expience of the ""multimedia"" CD, and of course one can't scan the book before purchase anyway because it is shrink wrapped. Be warned, the CD is a major disappointment. First, the CD does not install to the HD properly. Next, there are numerous discrepancies between the Labs and the text book. The Demos themselves are absolutely LAME! Also, they ARE NOT Multimedia - There are NO SOUNDS of any kind on the CD. How can the worlds largest publisher of so many excellent commercial software titles have released this ineffectual, unusable, and untested product? Have I made my point? DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,mspress has done a very poor job putting out this product,I purchased this product the 2nd and had problems with the first kit and returned the product for another and still had similar problems would advice comsumers to take a very close look a purchasing this product a lot of the labs do not operate correctly and this product does not load to you hard drive or for that matter their is no read text to tell you about the product problems; you can go to msn support site and they will inform you of the problems with the product that they unlikely to correct
3,This book is difficult to rate.,"This study kit provided me with my first taste of networking technology and I passed the exam with a score that any newbie would be proud to boast. However, I can't honestly say that I understood what I was doing when attempting to solve the complex configuration scenarios presented to me on the exam, skills which simply weren't addressed in this course. The purpose of the Networking Essentials course is to provide the student with a basic, general knowledge of networking technology and prepare him or her for more advanced certification programs, and this study kit does a fine job of that. However, bear in mind that the adaptive version of the exam will feed you some nightmarish topics not covered in this book!"
2,I agree wholeheartedly with the previous 2 reviews,"As a resouce book it is probably worth it. HOWEVER, if you do not have a job or background in IT then reading this book, by itself, will probably be insufficent training for passing the 70-058. I am still glad I bought the book because I think it will be helpful in the future, but my primary goal was to get study materials that would help me pass the exam - and the book fails miserably on that point. You can answer ALL of the end-of-chapter questions correctly, solve all of the trouble shooting problems, do all of the topology designs, and you will still not be prepared for the more difficult questions on the test."
1,This book is far easier than the exam!,The easy study questions in this book in no way prepare you for the test questions you'll face when taking the 078-050 exam. Pitiful accompaning CD with elementary animations. Avoid this book at all cost.
3,"Good introduction for beginners, but dont use as sole source","I only gave the book a five, because I am not sure what audience it was targeting. Was it a book to introduce people to the concept of networking or (as I was lead to believe) a comprehensive study guide to pass the MCSE core. As an introduction I felt the book was a very good attempt to bring complex concepts to the novice, so even with errors I would give it a 7. As a comprehensive study guide I would have to say a 3. I am in a self-study group with 15 other individuals, and most in the group, agree with this statement. Just for those that are curious, the study group has opted for the Sybex books, they cost much less, and seem to cover the required material with more comprehension. We are also using two of the popular study tests and they have been very helpful. Something to note this book is a second edition from MS so it should be better, but Sybex is 2yrs old and our new choice."
1,Don't buy this.,"I couldn't resist buying this becuse I thought it must be great with Microsoft's name on it. The questions at the end of the chapters were too easy. You must study several in depth guides to pass, and takes lots of tests to practice test taking. I would suggest: 0-7821-2220-5; 1-57610-237-8; 1-57610-192-4; 1-56205-826-6; You will not pass unless you practice taking lots of practice tests. I passed the first time with a 844. The test seemed very hard to me because I was nervous and it costs a lot."
2,Very apprehensive about the quality of information,"I'm currently enrolled at a junior college in the Networking Essentials course working toward a degreee in IST-Networking.I would expect that the corporation (MS) who designed and implemented the networking strategies and operating systems presently most popular in the corporate world would provide a thorough and cogent explanation and description of said items. Furthermore, that the educational materials provided by same corporation be in depth, concise, and thoroughly proofed for typo and grammatical errors is IMHO a must in order to validate the topic on which it is based.It is deeply disturbing to have not only missed the mark on all accounts, but to present some information in a self-contradictory manner within it's own pages. It does not bode well for the future of MS Press products at our school."
2,Don't depend on this book at all,"This is book is good if you are new into the world of networking. It has a lot of information. However, it will not help you to pass the exam. All the information in this book somehow are unorganized. You will feel lost if you don't practice."
2,"Poor choice, No details at all","I hoped this book could prepare my for the exam and teach me a lot about networking, it did neither. I failed my first exam. It has some good sections on cabling and topologies but most of the book falls far short of being useful. I bought the Network + Exam Prep from Coriolis and found what a good networking book is like, for less. I passed on my next try and passed the Comptia Network Plus exam too. Don't waste your bucks here."
3,"Great for pure learning, but not quite for exam prep","This book did teach me a lot of important concepts about networking. However, do not depend on this book as your only exam study guide. I took this exam twice -- one with 700/1000 and the second one is 933/1000. The passing score is 766. On the first time, I read this book and skim through the Exam Cram, but I failed. The second time I bought the MCSE readiness review (by Microsoft Press) and O'Reilly's ""MCSE The Core Exams in a Nutshell"". Boy the Nutshell (elephant) book really really helped me to pass the exam. It squeeze everything you need to know to pass the exam into less than 50 pages. I recommand this ""Nutshell"" book."
3,Could have been condensed greatly.,"I read this book cover to cover, and with the transcender exams (which helped immensely), I slid by the Networking Essentials adaptive exam with a score of 766 of a required 766. Of course, it was only 12 days from the time I bought the book until I took the exam. I am going to buy a set of the core four exam prep books, and I am seeking other alternatives to Microsot Press, mainly because I honestly do not think that Microsoft Press books are that much better, if not sub-par, for the money."
2,Not for exam preparation,This is an interesting book for general reading but should not be used for exam preparation. Major elements of the actual exam are not covered in enough detail and other elements of the exam are simply not covered at all! The actual material itself is not 100% acurate and the video reviews are a bit bland and sketchy to put it mildly. Hard to believe that the people who design the Microsoft tests had anything to do with this book. This book is not worth the money. Try the Exam Cram series.
3,Doesn't adequately prepare you for the Essentials exam.,"Good primer for general understanding of networking concepts and terminology. However, this text falls far short of adequately preparing the reader for the Networking Essentials exam. The questions at the end of each chapter are too easy and give a false sense of security. I highly recommend that you back up this book with ExamCram, Transcender tests and other reading materials."
2,bland,"I was surprised this product wasn't better. I LOVE the vitamin e cream and use it religiously so somehow I thought this would become another of my miracle products. Not so, consistency is very watery and doesn't feel very good to apply."
5,kirby bags,Genuine perfect fitting bags same as the ones at local Kirby dealer and the local dealer charges twice as much
5,Great for allergies,I love my Kirby and I love these bags. They are great for trapping the dust that so typically flies right back out of regular vacuum cleaners.
4,Just what I needed,So glad to have found the correct Kirby bags online! It has been such a problem finding the bags I need and not drive all over town searching for the local Kirby store. These came quickly and I could not be happier.
4,Much greater capacity,Less expensive than buying from Kirby direct and has much greater capacity than regular bags. It also appears to reduce dust better than previous Hepa bags
4,Kirby bags,Bags are used with a Kirby Sentra. The bags are heavy duty so will not rip as paper ones do.
5,Great Price,Great price for the amount you receive. Used to buy at the Kirby store and spent 30 bucks. Glad to have only spent half that!!
5,can't beat the price,"Last time I was at the vacuum store to pick up some more bags, they wanted $6 per bag. I don't think i will be back there since I now know you sell Kirby products."
4,good bags,these bags are agreat product for my kirby. They seem stronger and the hypoalergenic properties are great for dust reduction.
4,does it's job,The Kirby HEPA bags seems to do the job they were designed to do. I have no complaints
1,Does NOT fit Sentria,"I screwed up. I assumed ""fits ALL Sentria models"" meant it would fit my Sentria model. Apparently this is not the case. The cardboard piece that fits/connects to the vacuum is not the correct shape for my Sentria... Not even close. I will be returning."
1,Falsly advertised - NOT for Sentria,"This product is not for the Sentria, as is advertised in the product description. Nowhere on the packaging is the Sentria model mentioned. We forced the bags to fit our 2009 Sentria (with the use of a drill!) just to avoid the hassle and expense of returning them.You would think that with 2 previous reviews complaining of the exact same issue, this major problem would have been addressed.Oh. The shipping was fast."
5,The best!,These vac bags are the best if u have this type of Kirby... Would definitely suggest purchasing these to anyone...
5,Great,The filters/bags work great. I have had no problems. It is kind of a pain to put them on and take them off as some dust gets on the floor but you can just vacume that up.
3,fine,nothing wrong with the product. I ordered the wrong size for my Kirby. So I am now trying to make them fit till I run out and can order the correct size.
1,does not fit any new Kirby Vacumn Cleaners...not sentria 2010,"bought these bags because the price was right. What a disappointment... they dont fit my brand new 2010 Kirby Vacumn Cleaner. I will, of course, return them."
5,Kirby Sentria Bags,Order received well within promised interval. Received in perfect condition. Will definitely order bags through this company again.
2,Not an F style bag. Doesn't fit all Sentrias!,"I purchased these for my Kirby Sentria. They absolutely DO NOT fit my Sentria. They are the wrong dims, the bag does not attach to the vaccum as it should. These bags are not for all Sentrias as one would think by the description."
5,Quality bags at an excellent price,"This is the second set of these types of kirby vacuum bags I have bought on Amazon. These bags are a quality product, and the price compared to buying from the local vacuum store is a bargain. Delivery was quick, arrived a day earlier than quoted, and the bags arrived in good order."
5,GREAT BUY,Unfortunately I ran out of the Sentria Hepa bags for my Kirby and I had to purchase some locally while I waited for mine to come in. When I saw the difference in price from what I paid locally I was afraid I would wind up with a paper bag. I was very pleased when they were the cloth bags at almost half of what I paid locally. Thanks for the great deal!
3,Doesn't fit my machine,For the newer Sentria models these bags do not fit. These bags don't have the tabs on the top of the cardboard piece that holds it in place. My local Kirby store was helpful and swapped the bags for me.
4,Good for allergy reduction,We don't use any less quality of bags. Helps keep the allergens at bay and does a good job with the vacuum.
5,Great bags!,The Kirby bags that we ordered through Amazon are exactly like the ones purchased at the store for half the price.
4,Quick delivery,I was very pleased with the quick delivery of this item. they are exaclty what I needed and can't buy around here.
5,Great bags,"These are the best ones I have ever gotten. No dust, no smell. That is very important to someone who suffers with terrible allergies."
5,Kirby bags,These bags are very strong and help lift allergenics from your carpets and furniture.Never over fill them as it will drastically cut down on your machines efficiency.
1,Does Not Fit Sentria As Advertised,"I purchased these filters in good faith, under the misguided impression that they would fit my Kirby Sentria vacuum cleaner as advertised. The package arrived in good order, but made NO mention of fitting Sentria models as advertised. THEY DO NOT FIT THE SENTRIA, THEY DO NOT HAVE STYLE F MOUNTS. I didn't need to replace the bag until well after the product return expiration date. I am now stuck with vacuum bags that don't fit. Buyers beware!!!"
1,Not the right bags for my Sentria,"These bags looked to be good quality, but they are not the right bags for my Sentria. Apparently I need the style F bags. The advertising for this product is misleading. Perhaps these bags fit some Sentria models, but not the 2009."
1,These bags do NOT fit all Kirby vacuums,"Product information does not clearly state what the bag dimensions are but says that these bags fit all generation of Kirby vacuums from 1985...well if they mean that the hole in the bag fits the hose, then yes I guess that's true. However, these bags are shorter and wider than the bags that were meant for my Kirby which I purchased brand new in 1997. I had to shove the bag into the outer bag & zip it closed to make it fit. Very disappointed."
3,not the best,"i read all these reviews and decided t get the cd, i've been a fan of fast rappin for years. Frum the tip of my tounge i think is thge fastest song on the cd, but i don't think he's the fastest rapper though. Get the B.O.N.E. Enterprise (aka bone thugs n harmony) turn to flow motion and listen to krayzie bone's verse. I think it is faster"
4,tight album,"i just wanna say to that dude short fuse is mistaken bone isnt a copycat of twista this cd dropped in 92, bone on their cd faces of death have tracks on their that were recorded in 91 but the cd dint drop until 93 but bone has always had their own style."
3,Not the best,"I've read all these reviews and decided to get the cd. The cd is alright for an underground cd but did not rise to my expectations. Frum the tip of my tounge is the fastest song on the cd in my opinion, but i don't think he's the fastest rapper though. Buy Faces of death by B.O.N.E. Enterprise (aka Bone thugs n harmony) turn 2 flow motion and listen to Krayzie Bone's verse in that song. I think it's faster. But overall the cd is ight, u might find yourself skippin tha cd when your goin through your collection"
4,Works but slow using the 9 pin connection.,"I wanted to send data from my old computer to my new computer. Problem was not with the cable but with IE's transfer wizard feature now installed on Windows XP. My new computer didn't have a 25 pin connection so I used the 9 pin connection. Sending approx. 1Gb of data would take over 150 hrs using IE Transfer Wizard. I found it quicker (15 minutes) and just as easy to copy what I needed to a CD-R RW disk. I think the cable is perfect for transferring data but, I would suggest using some other data transfer program. I have not used the cable using the 25 pin connection yet, so I don't know if it would be faster."
3,Decent TTUSB,"Just recently purchased the GemSound DJ USB. I am a bedroom DJ.I own A LOT of records and planning to digitize all of them. I use mac. The software ""audacity"" program works well with the turntable but the ""soundsoap se"" CD does not have a copy for the mac. You can just download the latest versions via internet for soundsoap se you can use the license number on the cd.The turntable itself has sturdy design, with 33 1/3, 45, and 78 speed selection with included pitch control. You can also play your records in reverse-awesome! It does not have INPUT JACKS (RCA OR 1/4"") for connecting external devices for instace- a TAPE PLAYER!!! So you can digitize your tapes too. It also needs a HARD COVER lid for protection, storage and dust."
1,Needs reliable software,The Audacity software doesn't work. The software will not save the project as an aup or wav file file.
4,Good Product,"I have gotten this for Christmas. I have some records that are not on CD, and some that are, but now I can put this stuff on my hard drive. I have not yet hooked it up to the computer, but I did hook it up to my reciever and man what a great item. I was surprised that there were NO instructions at all, nor a troubleshooting number to call, however, i figured out what goes where. This was the best gift anyone could have gotten me. My wife is the best. I like this because of the RCA plugs are NOT hot wired. I did go to the Gemsight website, but there were NO turntables on that site. I was trying to figure out where in the hell was the belt, it was right up under the platter. The instructions did not mention that. I was going to send it back, but common sense told me where to find the belt."
1,Difficult to obtain cables,Unfortunately cannot properly review the product as having terrible difficulties obtaining an input/output cable. May have to have one made. This is not made plain in any documentation.
5,Loved this film,"Not the logest review I'll ever write, but here goes... I'm half way through and loving it. Ranbir Kapoor plays the part brilliantly, with Nargis Fakhri initially playing a bit of a spoiled brat, but if you look at her as just that, it's understandable. From then on the cinematography is fantastic - love the soundtrack (I'd buy it) and so looking forward to watching the second half. Not so much of a traditional Bollywood film (although I am a Bollywood amateur) with no mass dance scenes, but otherwise... I'll be looking out for more films with Ranbir in."
1,Outdated,"The differential diagnosis scheme presented in the book is very confusing. I think the best way to categorize lesions is by internal structure. This is the most prominent feature of any lesion. Any lesion can be one of three possibilities; radiolucent,radiopaque or mixed. There is no fourth possibility. After that lesions can be further grouped according to patient age, relation to teeth, site and other characteristic features. Oral radiology, principles and interpretation by white and pharaoh provides a perfect system of describing lesions in an easy and very organized manner. Wood and Goaz book was printed in 1997. It contains names of lesions that no longer exist. For example you will find odontogenic keratocyst which is renamed by WHO to keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its aggressive behavior. You should never study from such an outdated book that classify oral and maxillofacial lesions in a complicated and confusingway. I myself placed an order on amazon to return this book."
5,great meal replacement,"I am a very busy gal with a bad habit of skipping breakfast every single day. While I wouldn't mind losing 15 - 20 pounds, weight loss wasn't why I purchased this product. I needed something to help get me going and hold me over until lunch so I wasn't snacking all morning. This does just that! It keeps me full and anything chocolate flavored (and healthy) for breakfast is a winner in my book."
4,Better than I thought,"Bought this at a local store to try it out, it's pretty creamy mixed with just water. It was a lot easier to drink than other protein drinks I've tried, and it was surprisingly filling! It kept me pretty full for almost 5 hours (with only a light snack of trail mix). I would definitely buy this product again!"
5,So Tasty!,"I ordered these slimfast protein canisters after first trying them from the grocery store. I replace at least one meal a day (normally breakfast) to help control calories and keep me full longer! They taste amazing and really do keep me full. I highly recommend blending them. I use skim milk, 8 ice cubes, and a banana and it tasted just like a milk shake. I used someone elses advice on here and added a teaspoon of malt mix and it makes it taste just like a choco-banana malt. Although it doesn't need the banana or the malt mix, it's great on its own. hope this helps!"
3,Lacking in Taste,"I have used SlimFast powdered products on and off for years and really like the taste of the Chocolate Royall product sold at Sam's Club. I decided to order this Slimfast High Protein to help cut carbs. It is not a terrible taste, just lacking in rich chocolate flavor. When I use this purchase, I will go back to what I was using. Come on SlimFast, if you can do it in rich chocolate for one, why not the other?"
5,Decent meal replacement or supplement to a small meal.,It has a good taste and I like the extra protein. I generally add some ice cubes and fiber tablets and then blend it together to make a nice thick shake.
1,Disgusting!,"I have been using the drink mixes for some time and absolutely love them! I decided to try out this high protein version thinking it would taste the same as the regular version. It does NOT!! Not even close! This barely has any chocolate flavor at all, and tastes just like a plain protein shot. It has that characteristic protein taste and smell. I should also mention that that protein smell is quite overwhelming. As soon as I made my first shake I knew something was off, and after I barely got down my first sip I decided to throw out the rest of these containers and switch back to the regular version. My advice is if you are switching to this product, try one out first before buying the multi-pack because the taste is definitely not for everybody. I am extremely disappointed!!"
3,Great but Not So Great,The GREAT: I lost 10 pounds in 1 month. The NOT SO GREAT: I think it gave me tinnitus on my left ear. Tinnitus is where your ear rings or roars for some reason. My left ear started to roar like I was in a jet plane hearing the engines roar at 30000 feet.... very unnerving! I stopped using Slimfast and the tinnitus went away after 4 days of roaring in my left ear. Could it be the aspartame or phenylalanine that made me react so oddly? I think so. I like the product but think the artificial sweetener phenylalanine nearly blew my ear function. I did see a doctor and the doctor did say I have tinnitus but couldn't explain the cause.
3,good but powder does not mix,I like the slimfasts but I have found that the vanilla one does not mix well. The protein powder stays in globs and never mixes in right. This does not happen with the chocolate one
4,Hight Protein? Milk has 8g of protein alone,"In other words, it does not have a lot of protein as I thought it would. It taste excellent when you mix it with ice, a Slim shake smoothie otherwise, you will be able to taste and feel the powder on your mouth. I don't know if it actually does control your hunger or not as I drink it instead of taking a multi vitamin."
4,Good but you can make it better!,"I like this product alot. Keeps me full for 4-5 hours. But one thing I find is it has too much sugar (22 g). If you have this on a day when you eat even 1 piece of fruit, your're definitely going to go over the 24g of sugar ( 24g is reccomended sugar intake for 1200 calorie per day diet). To solve this- I use 1/2 a scoop of the powder and 4-6 oz of skim milk- adding enough ice to make it the right consistancy leaves you with the same amount of smoothie. The milder chocolatly flavor is actually favorable to me as well. I like to add 1/2 a bananna sometimes as well, it's really good. Overall pretty solid product- Just wish the sugar wasnt soo high."
4,Very good.,"This is a very good recording. The orchestra is conducted very well - the energetic pieces have genuine verve to them. The singers were good, but I still prefer the Original Broadway Cast Recording. The main of this album is we find out just how much has been left out of the other recordings. Listen to this and go see the show before it closes!"
5,The best complete soundtrack of Les Miserables.,"I won't review track by track, because that will take too long. My parents went to see this musical in 1991 or '92, and they brought home the Broadway version of the soundtrack. I listened to that for 8 or 9 years until I went to see it myself. It's a beautiful story, and even more wonderful music. There are no words to describe the awe of the long running musical. But this year I spent 40 bucks on this 3 CD set, and I'm glad I did. Even though I am a fan of popular music, I always love to listen to this complete soundtrack. It has a song for every emotion that the human race has. I urge you to go see the music, the legend, and the true movement of Les Miserables."
3,Not the best recording,"But that's only MY opinion. It's complete and that's great but I prefer the voices on the TAC recording. Gary Morris certainly doesn't compare to Colm Wilkinson. Phillip Quast is brilliant in both and Anthony Warlow makes a terrific Enjolras (better than Michael Maguire.) I prefer Ruthie Henshall's Fantine. Debra Byrne is okay but a bit too whiny for my liking. Michael Ball is fine but Marius doesn't appeal to me and neither does Cosette. I also prefer Lea Salonga as Eponine but Kaho Shimada is impressive, especially when you consider that she didn't know any English at the time. In ALFOR she actually sounds like she's dying, which is more than I can say for some Eponines I've heard. If you're a die-hard fan this recording is for you but if you want it just for the voices get the TAC."
4,"Ok so Gary Morris ""isn't"" Mr. Wilkinson to some of you...","But as a longtime Gary Morris (The country music entertainer)fan,I was mesmerized by his performances at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles. I've spoked to folks who saw him in New York....and believe me, No body threw rotting tomatoes at him.I have the CD and am quite happy that it's Gary's version as Jean Valjean on it. (I wouldn't have bought it otherwise). I'm not knocking ""your hero, Mr. Wilkinson"". Just because they have different presentations doesn't mean that one is better than the other. Just enjoy the whole show for what it is. A moving, powerful, production."
3,Too much?,"I love Les Mis and just received this version as a present. While there are awesome parts, I find that it is no the best version out there. Dreamcast is amazing. I find the orchestrations to be strange in some parts and some of the voices on the CD are not good as the dreamcast or original broadway. Also, the CD is quite different from the latest version that was on Broadway. Some of the cuts they made were very much needed and listening to the original now seems strange. However, when the orchestra is playing alone it sounds amazing and really lets the music shine through. Horns sounds GREAT!! Red and Black is not very good and it is very shouty at times."
3,Could have been 5 stars ...,"How on earth could the producers of this album undertake a complete recording of one of the best musicals around and *not* get the man who helped make it famous? Colm Wilkinson originated Jean Valjean both in London and on Broadway. He deserves to be on this CD. Morris is okay, but his performance is derivitive, obviously aping Wilkinson's much better talent.And Eponine ... Eponine is my favorite character in this play (other than Javert), and while I have no problem with an ""international"" cast, I wish they had found a more powerful performer than this girl, whose accent creeps in at the worst moments to ruin some great bits. Sigh."
3,It's... okay,"Yes, there are good aspects of the cd. For one thing, it has all the songs from the musical, which is the main reason why I bought it. I don't think there is such a thing as a bad Gavroche, and Ross does great as Gavroche. There is also Philip Quast and Micheal Ball who are swell in this cd but 10th Anniversary was better. However, the rest of the cast is absolutely horrible. Young Cosette sounds like she is singing through her nose and the main character has such a bad voice I want to cry. The Thenardiers aren't horrible but they are definitely not good. Eponine, I realize that she didn't speak English, but if they were supposed to get the best, they could have done better. Even Frances Ruffelle was better. I would recommend the 10th Anniversary Concert and the Original Broadway Cast before this one. Way before this one."
3,For fanatics only,"My best compliment for this version is the fact that nothing is cut. The segues and exchanges vital to the story are in this recording and that is worth the price in my book. However, I am sorely disappointed by most of the singers. Other than Philip Quast and Michael Ball, I'm left wondering how the rest of the cast was chosen for this project. They're not bad, but given the caliber of other recordings and the Tenth Anniversary performance, I believe it could have been much better. As I listen to the recording, I envision the stage performance and there's a distinct lack of flow between the characters. This is probably because they're pulled from shows all over the world and had never really performed this together before the recording. I would've much preferred the London or Broadway cast to this conglomeration."
4,Still the best recording,"Any recording of the full show has to be the best. Anthony Warlow and Philip Quast in fantastic form (as always) mean that this CD has to bought no matter what! The real down point (for me being a singer and a soprano) is Tracey Shayne. She sounds absolutley bimbo-ish (sorry to any Shayne fans out there...) too much of an immature child than Cosette should be. All in all though, this recording is fantastic...the high points are definetely Michael Ball, Anthiny Warlow, Kaho Shimada and Philip Quast."
5,Les Miserables Complete Symphonic Recording,"If you like ""Les Miserables,"" you will love this CD set. Pluses are as the title indicates, ""complete symphonic recording,"" fabulous voices, and an informative booklet that used a quality printing company."
4,Great Service as Usual,"Everyone has their own favorite version of Les Miserables so comment on that aspect is not particularily helpful. However, as usual Amazon's service (availabilty, speed of delivery and keeping the customer informed) was top notch. You might ask why the rating is not a 5 but 5's only come when I get more than I expect."
2,Misleading title,"Les Miserables Complete Symphonic RecordingAlthough the quality of the recording is excelent, the title is misleading for those like me, who were looking for purchasing only a Symphonic Orchestra Instrumental recording without the singing part. There are many other recording of the Musical with a singing cast and they don't say ""Symphonic"" on their title. This is the part that I found misleading when I came to purchase this item, and there was no information published about it, on Amazon, that would have helped me not to purchase this item, as it did not correspond to what I was looking for. It is only after opening it and starting to listen to the recording, that it became evident that this was not what I wanted to purchase, as it duplicated other recording of the same Musical, which I had purchased before. So be aware of this fact before you order this item."
5,WOW,"I love it, the only bad thing(if you could call it a bad thing) is that it does not include the amazing Colm Wilkonson."
2,Get this only if you are crazy on analysis,"It says in the booklet ""the Ultimate Les Mis Recording"". Yet, this is an ultimate recording without the ultimate cast. I suppose I expected too much before listening to it... only brings much more disappointment. Unless you don't have a chance to see the performance, or you feel like analysing the musical to every single line, this recording does not bring as much listening pleasure as any other Les Mis recording."
5,"Excellent, but...",get the 10th Anniversary recodring. That has the BEST cast ever assembled for this great musical!
5,A superb recording of what has become a classic show,"This is a must for ""Les Mis"" fans. Even if you have never seen the show, you must add this recording to your collection. Technically it is a masterpiece! The best selection of musicians that performed this musical all around the world. You will be amazed by the Japanese singer who doesn't speak English and the original Broadway star who is better known for C&W, but not any more. Highly recommended over the London and Broadway Cast recordings."
5,"A ""Rave"" Review","My first Les Miz experience was in high school. in choir we were doing a choral medley from the show. While we were learning this we studdied the musical. As a choir we went to a regional production in Madison WI, and from the on I was hooked. I've read other reviews debating which is a better Valjean, Colm Wilkinson or Gary Morris. This version is the only one I listen to. I can't get into the original or london cast. This is a great listen from disc 1 to disc 3. If you are a fan check it out."
4,Not the best Les Miz,"I was prepared to love this recording because it was complete - and I do like it fine, but I can't seem to fall in love. I first just listened and couldn't quite figure out what was missing. Then I read the liner notes and learned how it had been put together - orchestra recorded here, singers later, etc. and it came clear that it was missing the spark you can get when the musicians work together in a live setting. Too bad, it was a great idea."
2,Patton Oswalt Sings Colm Wilkinson,"Sorry if that offends but it was the image that immediately sprang to mind when I heard Gary Morris. What one looks for in a new recording for a show is the new artists interpretation of the work. What Gary Morris provides is a bad carbon copy of Colm Wilkinson's performance, right down to vocal inflection and pronunciation. I really have no issue with the rest of the cast's vocal performance because they are at times so very different from the approach of the Broadway and London recordings. I really don't know why I subconciously chose Patton Oswalt as the face for the voice I was hearing, but it's the one that stuck. Perhaps because I find it so ridiculously amusing that someone with a Broadway caliber voice would go to that much trouble to sound like someone else."
1,Les Mis CD flop,"Initially the CDs played well and beautifully, but then they stopped for some inexplicable reason. Will I be able to get a refund or a replacement? Thanks for your consideration."
4,Very good recording of an overly-hyped musical,"First of all, I would like to begin by saying that Colm Wilkonson could not sing his way out of a paper bag. Gag me. This recording is very good (would be even better with Patti) but I am not a huge fan of this show. It's too...big. If I were to tell you whether to buy Les Miserable or Miss Saigon (by those same French guys...can they right a musical that doesn't have ANYTHING to do with war?), I would have to say go for Miss Saigon. Miss Saigon is incredible, Les Miserable is decent."
3,not the best,"maybe it's because i have got the dream cast version first. i didn't find this one so much atractive, because the cast is not the best, and the whole symphonic thing doesn't quite touch me either. i'm sorry to find this."
4,Great translation!,"I read a few chapters of this book for my Chinese history class. There's no way I could read the original Chinese, but I felt the translation was very clear and I didn't have a hard time linguistically with it.This book's a great way to read some Mencius and the stories are great."
3,Mastering Autodesk Architectural Desktop,A good book over all but lacks the finer points for using the program. I would recommend the book for someone who has not had much experience using AutoCAD.
2,Try to figure out how to create i.e. Schedules,"Good book, but it could be better. You have to think the deepest tough to figure out where is the beginning and or the end of many procedures. Try to figure out the best way to approach the creation on a Door Schedule in 2d, for example.Good luck"
1,Confusing; Wast time book,"It is the most confusing and waste time book I ever read in this field, AutoCAD. As it is supposed to be as tutor book, It is far from this feature. In many cases it make step 1 step 2 and vise versa. But the most confusing thing is that while you are reading and try to apply what you are reading you look to find if you are doing right you don't find any fugure showing you where you have to click or to where you have to extend some thing or showing you the result of your work. It is all based on guise. The best example are pages 214 to 223 about the stair, railing, and ramp. Talking about his explanation of the display system, it is disaster !!"
2,Mastering Autodesk Architectural Desktop,OK book but would be nice to have all of the refered to files on the CD. Drawing file for chapter 3 is not on the enclosed CD.
5,What I was looking for!,"I am a self taught AutoCAD user and this book was exactly what I needed! This is my first time using Desktop, and I have learned a lot more from this book than I would have been able to pick up on my own. It is easy enough to follow, and I have learned more of the ""tricks"" to use when working. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a first time user of Desktop."
4,Mastering ADT3 hits the mark!,"Congratulations, Paul.For those of us in architectural community who wish to implement this program effectively, you have done a great service.The greatest challenge in upgrading an office to new software is the training involved. This book will make that job much easier, and will be a staple desktop reference for our associates after training.ADT3 is a huge leap in a new direction away from the traditional 'lines, arcs, and circles' methodology held over into CADD from the days of t-squares and triangles. And its not easy to master.This book offers insights to users and managers alike, the best being ""why"" things work the way they do in the program. I look forward to more from you, especially that Tips and Tricks Book I hope you'll write!"
2,"For General Info, Great. For serious study-Steer Away","Budge's works are generally considered a bit of an Egyptological embarrassment; his intentions were noble but he seemed to favor quantity over quality when it came to research and there are lingering questions about the extent of his ""exploitation"" of the antiquities trade. No one will know for certain whether his legacy to Egyptology was helpful or ultimately harmful but his works have served to generate a fantastic sort of curiosity about Egypt, which may benefit the preservation of archaeological goodies in the long run. This book, like all of his others, is rife with errors, contradictions, mistranslations of the ancient texts and sadly void of references for Budge's countless ""scientific"" assertions. Generally, however, he gets the basic qualities and legends of the deities correct. The amateur Egyptolgist may use this book with a grain of salt and opt instead for scholarly recent books by Meeks or Hornung."
4,Good Camera,"Pros:* Low Price for 4MP* metal face* good looks* light weight* 2"" LCD* lots of manual controls* good quality images* Optional cradle makes charging and image transfer a breeze.* Webcam feature if you use Windows XP full version.Cons:* Poor night shot capability but can be adjusted by software.* To install FinePix Viewer software on Windows XP-upgrade version, you must go thru ""My Computer..."" or call tech. support."
2,Will not work after a year,"This camera worked okay. Pictures were slightly blurred at times, especially when taking them inside. You have to put it on Auto instead of the people setting to get a good picture of people. Now, after less than a year later, when I go to take a picture, the camera shuts off right then and there. The lens doesn't even retract when it does this. Plus, it has new batteries, so that can't be the problem. Poor manufacturing and a complete waste of money. Pool out more money for a better camera than this one."
4,battery,"You need to make sure to bring a pair of good battery when using it. Other than this, the camera is all right"
5,Excellent book outlining clinical process!,"This book offers an excellent review of the clinical process of working with troubled families. The first author has published numerous controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. The book offers detailed descriptions of what it is like to be a parent of a troubled child, and what it is like for such a parent to go through therapy unavailable anywhere else. It also includes a detailed description of the collaborative process needed to engage families. The group-based approach described in this book is ideal for families who have a child identified as ADHD, Oppositional or Conduct Disordered, as well as for abusive families, multi-problem families and families at risk."
4,SOUNDGARDENISH SOUNDING BAND,"Well, this was a follow up to their Grunge laden KA-BLOOM album. People's Fuzz is all about...well Fuzz...The vocalist sounds weak, though the guitars make it up for it. Strictly for people who like Grunge.The last 25 Minutes of this 70 Minutes album have strange sounds..."
1,Beware: A Potter's Book,"This is now perhaps no more a historical document. Very sadly many potters have taken the book to be the bible of pottery, accepting all that is written without question. However the observations and comments within it are one man's only, and this shows considerable prejudice. Take care as there are many approaches to ceramics and it is flawed to consider anyone is the correct path. More than any other document this book has distorted generations of potters to consider that the Japanese rural tradition is superior to anything else, and hence has led to almost the homogenisation of studio ceramics. Explore other ways!"
3,Not bad,"...but not nearly good enough, I'm afraid. For some odd reason, the first trumpet is rather pronounced throughout the Sixth. That is not justified by what Glazunov wrote. Furthermore, after successive listenings, the wavery sound of the trumpet's vibrato eventually got on my nerves, and I had to give up this CD. Mind you, the orchestra isn't bad. They're actually pretty good, staying together and in tune. However, as a conservative composer, Glazunov needs more robustness and exactness out of the orchestra in order to show the listener what's beautiful about the music. Even in the ""Poéme lyrique,"" the gentle back-and-forth chromaticism needs to be handled more lightly, and ought to be very finely tuned. Both pieces are played passably, but those of us who are serious about this music need much more."
5,The Simply Gourmet Diabetes Cookbook,"If all you can do is buy one book, this is the one! This book is warm, understandable, thorough, educational, and worth every penny. To make things even better, it is full of wonderful recipes! I consider this book a companion, and I am not alone anymore.I have been diagnosed with diabetes for almost a year. I have struggled through materials from different sources, doctor visits, and nutritionist visits for months and was still confused. With this book in hand, I feel more positive, more grounded, and more capable of managing my disease.If I could rate this book freely, I would give it more than 5 stars."
4,They don't break,"a friend recommended this brand of picks. I love thin pics for faster strumming but they often break. he said to look for the turtle shell, they don't break. i've only been playing with these for about a month, but i've beat on my first pic pretty good and it is holding up perfectly. great recommendation!"
5,Only picks I use,I've been using these picks for years. Never have to worry about a pick breaking in the middle of a performance.
5,great,"I love these picks. They are not glossy like other picks, more of a slightly gritty matte finish. Makes for easy grasp of the pick, even after your fingers get a little sweaty."
4,Great product - but this is only a package of 12 and not 72.,"I love the tortex picks! They're easy to hold, they're durable, and this particular size allows you to strum without feeling like you're going to break the pick or the strings if you strum hard, yet thick enough to produce a good strong sound.Please be aware, however, that with this particular order you are going to get a package of 12, and not 72 as stated on this page."
3,a tad too thick for my liking,"These feel a bit too thick when playing my electric guitar, though on an acoustic one, they feel pretty good.Dunlop makes good picks.. so no qualms about the build quality.Go for the Yellow(0.73mm) or Orange(0.60mm) one..."
4,These picks are a good pick,"Good picks. No complaints. They are a good size, texture, color and pick like the best of them. Go for it!"
5,Nice Picks,"I got the picks well within time. The green pick may not look attractive to all, but it is very nice...The plastic is not to hard nor too soft. Also i got 3 Free picks, hence total 15 picks for me.Initially I got a little skeptical after opening the pack and seeing the size. I thought the size is small for my fingers, but they are perfect."
5,Best Picks,"I've been playing acoustic guitar for 17 years and these are by far my favorite pick. The thickness allows for individual string picking, but isn't too thin to cause excessive pick noise while strumming chords. The ""tortex"" texture of the pick allows for non-slip guitar picking."
4,love the tortex,"I have always used tortex picks. I like them a lot and they last forever (almost :)these were a little thick for my tastes. The red ones are a little thinner and give better action for strumming and also for fast alternate picking patterns.If you like a medium thick pick though, these are rockin."
1,Not for me,"At 1mm these picks feel too thick and stiff. To the touch they feel powdery or dusty for some reason, an unpleasant feel. After a few minutes of playing they make your fingers sweat and become very slippery- unlike any other pick I've tried. Because of that, after 2 or 3 uses the print on the pick starts smudging. I'll say though that the sound they generate is very crisp and bright. They are also very durable. But they're just no fun to use. Celluloid picks are still my favorite. But I have purchased a tortex pick from a band at a concert. It's unbranded, smaller, has print on both sides and yet exhibits none of the problems that this Dunlop pick has. So the issue isn't the tortex material itself. I suspect it's something Dunlop does, or most likely doesn't do; some surface treatment at the end that they are skipping on to save money I bet."
4,Picks don't stick,"Good pick, durable and bright so I can see it easily on stage. The only thing that I don't like is that they are pretty slick so they are hard to keep a hold of."
5,Quite possibly the best picks I've ever used,"This has been my favorite brand/model of picks for some time now. They are just grippable enough to hang on to well, but not so much that they produce any scratchiness when using them with a good set of strings (although I've heard the two heaviest gauges do produce a scratchy sound for some people - I personally switch back and forth between the 60mm and 88mm sizes, depending on what I'm playing). My favorite feature about these, though, definitely has to be that these little babies are darn near indestructible. I abuse the heck out of picks and can't recall every having had one go drastically out of shape or break on me even once."
3,not so great,I've got the orange .60 mm today in the mail and within 10-15 minutes of practice (scale practice on acoustic guitar) the tortex logo started to wear off... I'm frankly disappointed at the product... I've used Dunlop tortex picks before I also have .80mm and this never happened while I played.
2,Label smudges like newsprint,"These picks work fine when it comes to strumming and picking the strings of a guitar, and that's pretty key. Still, I have to give these a two-star, ""I don't like it"" review based on aesthetics.The black ink used to print the label smudged like newsprint. I played for 10 or 15 minutes and looked - black ink smudged all over. Maybe I'm just a sweaty guy - okay, I'm definitely a sweaty guy. Still, the pick looks disgusting and left black ink on my thumb. Jeez."
3,Non-multi colored picks,"The picture shows multi-colored picks, instead I got all yellow. As the other reviewer said, not that big a deal, it's just misleading."
2,Not the best picks in the world.,"I suppose if you want a heavy pick, Tortex might be on the top of your list. However, unless you also want black fingers and lips from the ink of the Tortex logo, I'd stay away from these."
1,Very bad,"I never come the product to my hands. I do not have information of the product, which I spend with the order?"
2,Not Multi-Color,"I was a little disappointed b/c the product image was misleading. It appears to be a dozen multi-colored picks, but I received all yellow. This isn't that big of a deal and I'm sure they'll work just fine, but when buying them for a child, choice of color does matter."
4,Nice grip and overall feel,"These picks have a nice feel and a great grip. I used a few picks before I discovered these, and this is the best one yet, I will not try any new picks for a while!"
5,Just what you need,"amazing. These are just the right thickness to play heavy rock songs, but at the same time play bluesy jams that require alot of finger work."
4,My Favorite,they definitely outlast the celluloid picks without becoming harsh sounding. i've never broken one. the powder coating is nice for musicians sweating on stage to keep good grip.the Dunlup .88 Tortex is my choice for everything and probably always will be.Made in USA (I like to support my neighbors)while Fender celluloids are Chinese.
4,"Love the picks, but didn't get them.","Actual Tortex Picks are probably my favorite types of picks. Unfortunately, I received knock-offs that are covered in a strange powder and are thinner than the real ones. I really like the real ones though, which is why I still gave this product 4 stars."
4,Good,"Good picks. They are light, and nice for strumming. I am a beginner, and have only used these and medium."
2,not easy to grip,These picks slip out of my fingers to easy... They're just too smooth I guess. My Dunlop picks are much easier to keep gripped.
2,LATE,"I got these pics about a MONTH after I ordered them. They did include 3 extra pics that I didn't order, but still, 1 month is ridiculous."
4,Like Bright Color,"I have tried few picks, textured, mallow color, and this bright green. I like it bright color that is very easy to found, and 0.88mm seems right for me to strumming on an acoustic guitar."
5,Nice picks,I got the green .88mm picks. From the feel of it I could tell that its made to last and the texture of the picks feels nice and grippy. The only gripe I had was the print on the pick smudged off. I wish dunlop would've etched it on the pick. All in all nice picks and fast shipping from Amazon.
1,Ink Comes Right Off Onto Your..,"Ink comes off with just a couple minutes of use. When I first saw a used pick I seriously thought it was an old pick I may have had, and tossed it in the trash since I had new ones to try out.When I saw the second pick after some use, and saw the ink all over my fingers .. and could only think of everything I had transferred ink onto including my guitar, the rest went in the trash.I have the stiffer yellow ones and none of them have any ink left, but it comes off much slower so I never noticed an issue. But probably won't buy any picks with ink on them in the future.Perhaps the ink can be removed with alcohol or mineral spirits?"
2,Suprise!?,"These picks seem to wear gradually...which for me is a great plus, cause the feel and accuracy tend to get ""tuned"", for a nice bite...Wear is more of an advantage, rather than chip -or- crack. Heavy enough to articulate a leading riff, or embellish a chourus...WELL CHOSEN MAT'L!!!-sWEEPING NEVER FELT SO RIGHT....! Also, I wanted to search for a pick,(picks) that had a stormy, depressive color. I needed to request each pick, in the dozen, to be individually gift-wrapped for my child. Upon arrival, all I received was twelve, Sun colored picks in a labeled bag. Billy expected gloom and what he got was inspiration and a product that worked! -Hey guys WHATS YOUR PROBLEM!??- K..."
1,Buyers Beware,"I first want to say I agree with the good reviews for these picks. Quality wise, they are very good. The grip on them is superb and the sound is great. HOWEVER, I chose these picks rather than the cheaper ones because of the image Amazon has for them. I was expecting the 6 different colors, and all I was shipped was the blue.Though the quality is nice, spend less money on the other generic Dunlop Tortex picks because the only reason to spend more on these is the thought you'll get a variety of color choices. Wrong! Beware the misleading picture!"
3,Take your pick....,"Oh, if only you could! I remember when you could go into a music store and try out a bunch of picks, then choose a few that might work. Now you have to buy a sealed pack of twelve and hope you like them! Unless, of course, you are replacing a known quantity. I thought these were what I was currently using, the writing on my pick, if any, was worn off. Same color, but not the same pick, unless they changed the construction.So the pick seems fine, just does not feel right. Picks are such a personal thing, the feel and action required is so subtle, the resulting tone is varied among different materials and thicknesses. Find what you like before you buy, if possible. If you get stuck with some you don't like, give them away so others can try them out. I will. This might be the pick they are looking for!"
5,Darn fine picks,The picks... They're darn fine... They pick like crazy... Strum pretty darn good too... These are taking the place of my milk jug picks... They are darn fine... DARN FINE!!! BUY THEM!!!!
5,Great Picks!,"I use a flat pick between my thumb and index finger and I pluck with my remaining 3 fingers. The Dunlop Tortex .73mm picks suit my needs just fine.Their shape and size feel good in my hands and for me the .73mm pick is stiff enough for double picking while not feeling too stiff.Also, lets face it..... we all drop our picks once in a while, and when that happens the bright yellow color of these picks makes them easy to find!Thanks for reading,R. J. H."
4,Excellent all around pick,"These are great picks, I prefer the green, sometimes the blue if I want it a little stiffer. The reason I left off a star is that I feel these picks change texture slightly as you use them becoming a little bit slicker as they heat up."
4,Good Pick for an amature like myself,I like them because they are somewhat stiff and don't break. The pack will last me a long long time.
5,Tortex Orange,"These picks are extremely durable, comfortable, and versatile. They can comfortably play anything from guitar to bass to mandolin to ukulele. They never slip in my hands and very rarely will they ever break. These are the only type of picks that you will ever need."
4,Great song,"I like this song ""I know him so well"" It was another best song Steps have sung. The video was okay because Steps wasn't really in this music video much and all it was just their song ""Words Are Not Enough"" with some animation for the rest of the video clip."
5,These Brats Are The Best Ever,My brother bought these for me last Christmas. These are THE best Brats I have ever eaten. No need to search elsewhere. Just order the 10 pounder and go for it. We are ordering more for Thanksgiving too. Thanks Bro.
3,Audio-Video (RCA) cable,"Upon calling Amazon about not receiving these cables after 25 days, I received them in three days quickly."
2,Something about the taste.,Product was shipped fast and as soon as I got it I tried it....didn't like it. It has a medicine after taste.
3,No what I was exspecting,"I thought it was too small. People have to get in your face before they can see all the beautiful detail. That is my only complaint about it. It is very pretty, but just too small. I think it would of been nicer if it were bigger, but I still like it & still will wear it."
4,It really makes great cotton candy!!,"It really makes good cotton candy!! only gripe I have is that I got the bubble with the door and the instruction says close dome leaving just enough room to be able to reach inside and spin the flossing cone. So you hold the door with one hand, the other hand you hold the cone. Its alittle hard to do this so you end up opening the door of the dome then you get cotton candy flying out of the bubble. I say its a faulty design on the dome with the door.. I'm not sure how the machines with the open top dome do but I wish I had the open top dome.. on the good side of the dome with the door, you close the door and it keeps the unit clean from dust and other house dirt. Overall I am very happy with the machine and unlike all other home use machine this one really makes good amount of cotton candy!! I plan to use it at my son's birthday party!! I'm sure it'll be a hit with al the guests!!!"
1,Doesn't work - fuse blows,"I assembled this product andtried to use it. On my first attempt, the 10amp fuse blew. Thought the fuse might have been bad. Went all over town looking for a 10amp 5x20 fuse. Could not fuind any stores that carry the fuse. Ordered the fuse from an online vendor. Tried the machine again. Fuse blew again. Sent email to customer service asking if this was a known problem, no response. Waste of money."
4,Awesome!,"Thought ours was a dud too, so we called the company. Before we even told them what was wrong they said that the Heat switch doesn't light up, and that you have to have both the Heating and Motor switch on for it to heat up. So I guess they get lots of calls. :) Basically the instruction book is wrong. :) After that it seems to work great!One other note is that it doesn't actually look like the book/picture, the dome doesn't lift up."
1,Very poor quality,"I had the same issue.* poor instructions* safety issue with the actual cotton candy maker* Heating element and spinner are both on -- didn't work. I checked on the fuse -- fuse is good, but it still didn't work* I have returned 3 so far because none worked, and I am NOT planning to get a replacement cart again. I'm better off renting a working cotton candy cart"
1,"I ordered one through another vendor -- same issue, it doesn't work","Ditto. We followed the instructions and machine doesn't turn on --- the heating element didnt turn on, spinner didnt turn, motor didnt turn on. Machine has two off and on switches and one light on one switch lit up but nothing worked!!!We even checked the fuse -- all good, but the machine still doesn't work! Very poor quality. I think the Helmanngroup is the distributor of this nostalgia product."
1,Doesnt work,"Just received machine today, very excited put it together followed directions and machine doesnt even turn on, yes that is what i said heating element didnt turn on, spinner didnt turn, motor didnt turn on. Machine has two off and on switches and one light on one switch lit up but nothing worked.If you buy this machine do yourself a favor and plug it in to see if it works before you go through the trouble of assembling it."
2,DIsappointed,"I bough tthis book on an impulse since I was doing some soul searching at the time and I was looking for something with an insight into the Celtic mindset. Well while the authors cannot help what I was thinking the book would be about, I was very disappointed since there was really no substance to the book at all. A few personal stories and a brief fly-by about communion.I would not reccomend this book to anyone."
1,Really Unreadable,"The first book, Horse Sense and the human Heart I think set the tone for the whole work of horse therapy. This is just a bunch of hoo ha about being Irish and horses.Buy the first one in vast quantities. It's the gold standard."
5,Smooth Refreshing Feel,"This is a very nice product that leaves your hands and feet feeling so smooth and healthier. The fragrance is sweet and mild. Good product, would purchase again."
2,bath towels,I thought that these towels would be of a better quality. They are thin and not too absorbant..
1,Misleading Picture and Description,"The picture and description of the towels was very misleading. It appeared that it was a 3-piece set, when, in fact, it was one (very thin) bath towel for $9.99.Definitely not worth the price. You can get towels of better quality at Wal-Mart for $4.99."
1,"liar, liar!","This book is what you call a hot mess. #1. it is extremely unorganized; #2. they say things and present no proof of it; #3. they are looking at the history of African Women from the perspective of educated, middle class Western women not from that of the people they are writing about; #4. extremely bias in their use of terms, especially those related to Islam and other religions; #5 it is such a disappointment to know that these are the writers and scholars who are considered ""experts"" on women in Africa, and the issues they face, what a shame."
1,To small,"I am a big fan of Lance Armstrong and I bought my first Livestrong wristband years ago, but this one is smaller.The first one I bought at Macys was made in Taiwan, this was about three or four years ago and the one i bought from Amazon was made in China. I have large wrist ,if you have small wrist then buy this one it is a little to small for me. The shiping cost is only 1.95."
5,Great cause!,"Although these bracelets are the 'in' thing amongst kids/teenagers right now (kids at the local school are wearing rubber bracelets up to their elbows!), these Livestrong bracelets are for an awesome cause! I think everyone should get at least one. There's also other rubber bracelets for other causes you can find online like for breast cancer, heart disease, the tsunami relief fund....and lots of other things. I think they're a great!"
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered a live strong wrist band, in the description it did not say youth size, I emailed the seller after I received the item to exchange the seller never responded,the sell3r 3 monkeys"
1,Bad,I ordered this wrist ban for adults and received the youth side I complained and never got a refund or contacted by the seller... bad business.
4,"Awesome, but a bit pricy","Awesome product. This is only my second LiveStrong bracelet I've purchased. My first one lasted me three years so I'm hoping I'll get the same length out of this one. The one thing that was questionable was the price. $[...] plus a $[...]shipping price. That's a bit much. Almost $[...] for this bracelet, but overall it's a great product."
5,Livestrong!,"What can I really say, it was your normal silicone/rubber bracelet with LIVESTRONG printed on it. I mostly got it to be in a kind of solidarity with my ex-boyfriend who wasn't such a big ex at the time. The thing I want to rave about is the customer service that this company had displayed. I accidentally ordered this youth size and called them right away - they changed it to the adult size with no extra charge and sent it right over. No hassle and got what I wanted, LOVE IT!"
1,Leaves black blobs,Smooth-writing pen with a broader tip (1.0mm). Intense black ink that is fairly slow to dry on glossy paper.Worse failing -- and this is unforgivable -- is that it leaves messy black blobs when ruling a line (at the end on the line).Not recommended.Update: Since writing the above I have warmed to this pen and now use it as my regular writing instrument - easy writing plus the brilliant black are positives. I wanted a gel pen with a removable cap so I would be forced to re-cap the pen before putting it in a shirt pocket. I ruined four white shirts in short order with a 'clicker' pen by failing to retract the ball before pocketing it.The negatives -- slow drying and blobby lines -- annoy me but I'll put up with them. Make this review *** - three stars.
2,Flimsy pan,This tart pan is quite flimsy. I've only used it twice and the edges of the pan already look worn and slightly bent. I suggest going for a sturdier pan.
5,The Dictionary of Classical Mythology by Robert E. Bell,"The Dictionary of Classical Mythology was a wonderful book. I once did a project on Hermes, a Greek Messenger and Robert E. Bell's book really helped me find wonderful information on my topic. He really explains everything so well. Ever since I read his book I have really liked Greek Mythology. I know I am only a teen-age girl, but I really liked learning about this. I really recommend this book to anyone that is willing to learn about Greek Mythology or just needs information on a project."
3,Pulp western. . .,"This Mickey Rooney vehicle from 1951 is based on a 1936 novel by the great pulp writer, Max Brand. It stays faithful to the bare bones of the plot, about a tenderfoot (Rooney) and a lawman (Robert Preston) heading south of the border on separate missions that unexpectedly converge. Preston is well cast as the lawman. Rooney is Andy Hardy as a dude in the West, often playing his scenes for the comedy in them.The film was shot mostly in Mexico. Much of the story takes place at night, and the cinematography makes much of the shadowy streets and interiors. Robert Stack is credible as a handsome and smoothly vicious villain. Veteran actor José Torvay does well as a blacksmith who comes to the aid of the two protagonists. Wanda Hendrix plays a helpful señorita. Not exactly a B-western but not A-quality either, the film passes the time amiably."
2,Hawthorn Pantry Tower,"First up, although the product arrived with a center shelf (unmovable shelf) that was cleanly split in half. However, it only took a week for a new one to be shipped to me (at my stubborn insistance to Amazon which had offered to give me $50 to take it as it was, but I refused). So! A good thing is the Hawthorn company stood behind its product.The bad thing is the cabinet when assembled was a tad wobbly from side to side. I don't know if that was my fault, but to be on the safe side, I bought small, L shaped shelf brackets and installed about 6 of them (this only cost a few dollars) and the wobble disappeared completely. That said, the cabinet is pretty and I'm happy with it (which may be a miracle, or maybe my meds have kicked in : )"
4,no problem here....,"I had no problem powering my toshiba laptop with this inverter. I was drawing approximately 140 watts -- a bit more than one amp and things work fine.The short answer is that it works great, when plugged in to a car battery (ie via the cigarette lighter port), as it was intended to be used.It's possible that you could plug this inverter into some hokey battery-charging device meant to 'recharge' your auto battery, but I doubt that you'll get that much power out of it as you only get out most of what you put in."
2,It's large and heavy and only puts out less than one amp.,"I have a Compact Armada 1400 Series of notebook computer. I bought one of these converters thinking I could connect it to a 12 volt power supply. One that is used to start cars by plugging into the cigarette lighter. I was hoping to get several hours of service while I was on my 14 hour flight to Japan. It did not work for me, either with the portible power supply or plugged into my car lighter. There was just not enough amperage to power the AC to DC converter that plugs into my computer. Maybe it works on computers that require less than one amp of power."
1,BELKIN SUCKS!,"I bought the old model of this that offered with it a nice rebate. Unfortunately, without testing the product I sent in the UPC barcode. THE NEXT DAY I tested it and realized that it made a loud whistling sound, and meanwhile the standard fan noise is quite excessive.I contacted the rebate company well before they received my letter with the rebate materials (and before processing) asking if they could send it back to me. Even with emails and finally speaking to a customer rep on the phone, they would not budge and said it could not be sent back to me once received.Meanwhile, now my only recourse is to ask for a replacement (of this CRAP product) from Belkin, and yet even if it's proven defective I have to pay for the return shipping.Buy at your own risk!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I purchased a Fuji E510 in December. Over the past few months I have taken about 1000 shots. I purchased the E510 because I wanted a camera with manual controls and close-up capabilities that my older Fuji FinePix A210 did not have. The E510 is small and easy to use. Taking pictures is fast and easy, and battery life it excellent. Close-up pictures of flowers are clear and crisp. Portraits also look excellent. My big complaint is that wide angle landscape shots are not sharp. Buildings, backgrounds, and landscape shots all look fuzzy. My older Fuji FinePix A210 (only 3 megapixel) yields much better shots outdoors. If you want to take wide angle pictures outdoors, of mountains or cityscapes, for example, I would not recommend the Fuji FinePix E510."
4,Wonderful Camera!,"I LOVE this camera! Both indoor and outdoor pictures turn out great, and after I invested in rechargable AA batteries, the camera will last a long time. Also, I was impressed with the macro function, and the grip is very nice. Smaller cameras are nice, but I need a grip because I can be a little clumsy. The xD card was kind of expensive, but well worth the money.I didn't give it 5 stars because of the extra money I had to invest to make it usable (i.e. the batteries and the picture card.) But besides that I can't wait to take more pictures with it!"
4,Beautifull camera,"i love the feel of it,it is excellent for first time user whom want to just point and shoot,it also have additional features to explore.the flash so far has been excellent.i mit get in trouble for this but in a way it feels like a smaller version to the sony dsc-h1"
2,Yes It is old,It is a great camera. Easier to use than most modern cameras. Does not have a dedicated waterproof housing//Attachment like telephoto can be found if you look under a hay stack. Picture quality is somewhat lousy. Find and carry spare parts good. Has a butterfly screw. Impossible to take apart. Got sand in camera and fuji refused to take apart at any price. Yes it is an old camera. If the funds allow buy a more modern camera and send your old 510 to me BUS. I purrchased an old fuji camera for @ $100.00. Paying more is not worth it any condition. Need flood lamps for dark video and stills at night.
1,disappointed,"I had a 2800 finepix which I used for 3 years and thousands of pix around the world with stellar results. The E510 I found gave generally poor quality pix, either blurry or improperly exposed, ocassionally a good shot would come through. I talked to a local authorized repair store and was told that the problem was probably the lens system and that that part was way back ordered. I returned the camera to Amazon for full refund.So disappointed, fujifilm had an A-1 rep in my mind; I would still give them a try on another model in the future."
3,Cheaply made; there are better alternatives,"I was a bit wary in trying out this camera because it was so flimsy, but I thought for a second, everyday kind of camera, it would be adequate. Nevertheless, I kept worrying some part would get loose or fall off. I should have listened to my intuition Sure enough, the hinge on the built in flash just stopped flipping after 5 minutes. You can do better elsewhere."
4,Overall Excellent .... but look...,I thought from the description that the camera's image in the built in display could be better (sometimes is too dark).Takes great pictures and the option of adding extra lenses is great.Its very easy to use and the auto photo shoot does everything you need.Overall rating is excellent.
3,Not a wedding camera...,"As excited as I was to buy my Fuji E510 last June, I have found that it does not truly live up to my expectations.The outside pictures come out with great quality. On a trip to San Antonio, I have post card quality pictures of the Alamo. However, during the past 3 weddings that I have attended within the past 3 months, I have very few pictures to show for it.If you turn the flash on, the pictures are clear, but dark as ever. If you turn the flash off, the color is brighter, but you're lucky to be able to see what you have just photographed because of the blur. The shake effect on this camera for non-flash, indoor photos is absolutely horrible. I am upgrading to an Olympus, which I hope will be a more dependable camera for future wedding pictures. If not, I'll find one out there that will."
1,Home Security,"Written in the UK, only partly applicable to the US market.Wireless technology is not covered. Which is a big disadvantage since wireless has become the preferred alternative to hardwird systems. The lock technology presented seems to be quaint."
3,Good introductory book on locks and alarms.,"This book is adequate for the average homeowner who is interested in installing a moderately complex security system, which I suppose is most homeowners. It needs to be updated."
2,Brigitte and not much else...,"""Women"" is one of Brigitte Bardot's last films, and its an odd one. It begins cutely if rather like a sitcom; it contains a slapstick chase scene which suggests screwball comedy; but after a while, it switches gears and becomes a rather boring, talky drama. Bardot is the whole show here, and strangely, she's not in the film all that much! Most of the time, we're off on a flashback involving the male character, a singularly unappealing pig. That he gets his just desserts courtesy of Bardot doesn't really satisfy the viewer. Its also a relic of its time period -- 1969 -- with grainy half-in-focus images and too much zoom lens usage. Another troubling aspect is the lousy soundtrack -- its really badly dubbed. Yikes -- I'd rather have it in French with subtitles! Unless you're really into Bardot -- and she's beginning to look a bit blowsy here -- you may as well skip this one. Its not terrible, it just not worth your time."
5,Great Acoustics!,I am a recent nursing graduate and this stethoscope is AMAZING! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! It is WELL worth the money....Heart and lung sounds are amplified and the only thing you need to do to hear fine murmurs is to press the bell firmly on the patients chest. It has a sleek and modern look and I am so glad I made this purchase. I would HIGHLY recommend it to any person in the medical profession.
5,How did I ever manage without this??,"This is absolutely lovely! I was put off by Littmann somewhat, when we had to use these which had two headsets for a medical class. I swear I couldn't hear a thing ever, when we used those. My teacher called this brand the Ferrari of the stethoscopes. I was very skeptical of it, especially for the price. I have the heart stethoscope which works fairly well. This however, makes vitals so freaking loud, which is great in noisy situations. I will use my heart as a special occasion, I will be using this constantly. It's visually appealing, and functions perfectly. I ordered the all-black to match everything I wear."
4,Quick turn around time!,I was pleased with the quick turn around time in the shipping! Thanks so much!
4,Great DVD-Rs,The Product is Great.The Price is Good.But the package (Plastic cover over the DVD-Rs) was broken.I would not have picked it off of a store shelf.And if I had I would have expected more of a discount.Not to worry - I will buy more. Thanks.
2,Horrible Packaging,Decent price. Quick shipping. That's pretty much the good stuff. Both the DVD spindles came broken. The dvd's barely stayed in the box. Whomever packaged this was an absolutely moron.http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007PN5MS/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1
3,"Spindle Broken, Base Cracked","First, let me say that the disks themselves are fine. No complaints about the disks. This review is about the storage cylinder. When my 100-disk spindle arrived, the spindle itself was broken from its base, and the base was cracked in such a way as to make it impossible to lock the cover. Fortunately I've been buying this product for a long time and still had an old storage cylinder from the days when the spindle and base were molded from a single piece of plastic. The reason I still have that old cylinder is that I've been using it to store the disks from the all the newer storage cylinders that had arrived broken. At first I had thought this was Amazon's fault but I have had this problem from other retailers as well. I don't know how much Sony is saving on the new storage cylinder design but I am confident that it is costing them far more in customer defection."
1,bad seller,i came across this and thought i had found a good deal so i ordered 2 packs of these around $50 bucks plus $16 shipping only to open a box full of 2 busted spindles yes that's right 200 disks scratched all up i contact the company and they acted like it wasn't there problem was promised a return shipping lable but they never sent me one i think these are just items that can not be put on a shelf cause it was damaged to start with over all i will not buy from this seller ever again! very bad seller and damaged goods
1,UNreliable!,"Dropouts, stopped action, sudden pixelation where there should not be any- and that was on the ones that worked. I had 25% shrink with this product. That means, out of 100 discs, 25 didn't work (actually, the number was 27). I find this an unacceptable figure. It's not my equipment, everything's been checked out, twice. Between the bad discs and the time wasted and the successful discs that were nothing to write home about, either,this was not one of my favorite experiences. Caveat emptor! Let the buyer, beware."
4,"Works great, no probs for me","I've rarely had a problem with burning anything to these media and have gone through almost 500 in the last several years. I do have to agree with a few posts that mention the case being flimsy or cracked.I almost sent one order back that had two cracked cases. Several discs were dirty and lightly scratched from each spindle. The media works great for me, but the casing could be a lot better."
1,Bad Quality,"I recently ordered the 100-pack. It turns out every single DVD in the pack degrades in quality towards the outer fringes of the disk. I was not able to burn even a single DVD without problems. SONY warranty requires that the DVD's be sent back, postage prepaid. So much for rubbing it in. Now I'm hoping the turn around time will be prompt."
2,Buy the 50-pack instead,"For DVD-R's, I'll use either Memorex or Sony. When I buy the 50-pack, I might have 2-4 discs fail to burn. However, when I buy a 100-pack, the failure rate increase to as many as 15. At times, I can run into 3 failed discs in a row. It makes one wonder if all the extra weight damages the discs or even the possibility that people are more willing to buy the cheaper 50-pack, leaving the 100-pack sitting on the shelf for who knows how long and it degrades. So, Sony may be a good brand, but I recommend opting to buy the smaller pack."
1,Unreliable,"Having lots of problems recording reliably with this brand. About 1-in-3 or 1-in-4 is bad. Bad is defined as not playing on my PC. The drive busy light stays on but nothing is displayed by the player software. That's a high failure rate. All recordings were made on my Panasonic DMR-EH75V DVR. Bought these media at Costco. Previously they carried TDK brand. Had no problems with those. If 1-in-100 was bad, it was unusual."
3,Just ok,"It's not printable which is what I thought I was buying,but I'll just keep it this time because I can still use them."
1,False advertising. Amazons fault?,I purchased this product based on the product description which specifically said the discs were x8.When the product arrived they were x16.My drive cannot format x16.
1,Wrong Product,I ordered this item because it represented itself as 8x speed. When I received the product it was 1-16x speed which is not compatable with my recorder. Needless to say I returned it.
2,Broken,I ordered 2 spool packages of sony DVD R's both packages were broken and the disks were all over the box. i realize that it was some what cheaper but come on compusa dont throw your trash at me. The packaging looked broken before shipping. I hope i am wrong and it happened during shipping but i really doubt it.Crappy Service
1,You must be kidding...,"I bought it from CompUSA, and they sent me a CD-R Storage Spindle!!!! I paid for a DVD-R!!! Even worse: I live in Brazil!!!! There is no way I can return it and get a refund...Thank you very much, CompUSA! I've just threw USD 70 (with S&H;) in the trash!!!I'm sad I don't live in the USA, so I could sue CompUSA..."
1,I would not order from CompUSA again,"CompUSA sent my order late, and when I finally got it, it was the wrong product. I was able to return the product, and they paid for shipping, but their service seemed unfriendly and slow. I'll probably avoid online orders from CompUSA in the future."
5,Great Product,"I will buy this product again from the same company. It was fast service. As a matter of fact, the package arrived before time."
1,Horrible Discs. Keep getting stuck in my mac and wont eject,"I have been buying these sony discs for years. I don't know if their quality isn't the same anymore or I received a bad batch.I am having issues burning files occasionally but that happens with most discs. My real issue is the discs keep get stuck in my mac book pro!They won't eject with the eject button, my mac tries but the disc doesn't come out. I think it's due to the poor quality. the edges on these discs are very bumpy and inconsistent.Pass on this deal and buy another brand. Hate to fill a landfill with 100 unused discs."
1,DON'T BUY THESE,I have no idea how these are even on the market. Bought some on sale at the store and none of them work. They won't initialize in my dvd player at all. Too bad I didn't check on Amazon first.
2,Too many errors,"I bought this book yesterday. I am currently in chapter 3 and have already found 3 glaring errors. One question stated that there were three correct choices. The answer key only gave one answer.On another question, the explanation of the question stated the correct answer, but in the answer key, it gave the incorrect letter choice. This is the third A+ book I have purchased and the only one I'm not sure I can trust."
4,Best digital frame on the market,"This frame blows the rest away with wireless networking and Windows SideShow. One gripe is that it forced me to stop using my old 40 bit WEP key (probably not a bad thing) and move towards WPA-PSK. The Momento frame didnt work with the 40 bit key at all. I have had some problems finding good SideShow Gadgets for Vista but that's not the frame's problem really. I expect that this will improve over time as SideShow devices become more prevalent. At the moment there are only three or four SideShow Gadgets that actually work. This is great for pictures because you don't need it insert memory cards. Just share the pictures on your PC and point the frame at the share. I also love the power saving mode that shut's down the screen during sleeping hours. This frame has tons of features. Perhaps a little too expensive for the average person. If you need the best frame on the market, this is it."
1,Simply Doesn't Work,"I gave this a one star rating only because the system wouldn't allow me to give it a zero star rating. I bought the Momento 70 7 inch Wireless Digital Picture Frame as a birthday gift for my wife. It would not power on, so I returned it. I got the replacement unit - same problem. I thought that I must be doing something wrong. I tried different outlets, unplugging the cord at the unit etc. Nothing helped (I even reread the instructions!) I attempted to get help from Momento's customer service. I sent them an e-mail, but they never responded. I am going to return this product and search for one from a different company that will work."
1,Company has folded their service,"I bought this frame for my mother so she could enjoy pics of the grandkids. Their Momento Live service isn't the best, but it did allow me to upload pics, which would be downloaded to the frame. I live in California, she lives in PA. It was a good solution for us at the time.Unfortunately the company is shuttering the service at the end of Feb. 2009.Now we have an expensive ($300+ piece of hardware that will sit in her house and no longer provide access to one of the main features that lead me to buy it. :(Buyer beware."
1,Service will be terminated,"I bought this frame in December 08 to share pictures from our live in Singapore with our parents in Germany.Unfortunately the momentolive service never worked as advertised, actually this service did not work at all. Mails to imate service remained unanswered or were answered using standard text blocks.On top of that I received now a mail stating that the momentolive service will be terminated in March '09, so the frame will be just a frame like all other photo frames.It is able to show pictures from various memory cards, photos hosted and shared by a Windows Media Player Library and is able to act as Windows SideShow device."
4,Does not work with all XP OS,"Well I thought this was great since I didn't feel like taking a chance and upgrading to Vista. When I got it out of the box it is a great frame, looks clean and has an easy setup process. But when I tried to download windows media player 11 onto my computer so I can share the folders I found out that I have the 2004 XP Media Editon which cannot download media player 11 and thus I can't use this feature unless I want to upgrade my computer or buy a new one.Other than that the frame is great and I plan on purchasing another one for my mom so that I can just email her pictures and she doesn't need to worry about putting items on a memory card and then using it in the frame."
1,Don't buy this frame! Momento Live service being terminated,"I have had this frame since October 2007. Besides the hassle of getting it on my wireless network, I have loved using the frame and viewing my pictures. But yesterday I received an email stating that the Momento Live service which allows you to view photos on your frame via RSS feeds is now being discontinued. With that said, don't buy this frame! Sadly, my frame is now identical to the $70 Kodak frame that I just bought my mom for Christmas."
2,Poor/no customer service / response,"The product itself works well. However, we wanted to sign up for the online service in which we could send photos to the frame via email. When we went to the website to do this, the site told us that our frame had already been registered by someone (even though it was brand-new from Amazon). Over the past month we have been repeatedly trying to contact the customer service reps over email and phone and have never gotten through to anyone, nor received a response from anyone. Seems like a good product, but they really seem to have no idea how to run a business or how to respond to customers.If anyone from Momento actually reads this posting please contact me so that we can resolve this issue. Thanks."
5,Wonderful adaptation,"A truly wonderful transpostion of the famous Goldberg Variations to a string trio. It sounds like Bach himself did it, and since Bach was known to rework some of his own pieces into other works it seems like a perfectly reasonable and appropriate thing to have done."
1,Not every scholar should write for students.,"I was a student of Mr. Ross's, taking Discrete Math, a few years ago. He's is a very intelligent man and seemed to enjoy teaching. Unfortunately, he was not very good at it. And same goes for this text book of his. His attitude and approach in the classroom and the book's alike might be helpful if the student has already mastered the majority of the covered topics, in which case, this book becomes useless."
1,terrible book,"I keep thinking as I'm forced to use this book for a college course, that Discrete Math would not be so confusing to me if not for this textbook. With a good textbook, I believe the concepts would not be very difficult, but this book makes them so. True, they have many examples - very few of which cover the complex things you are then asked to do in the Exercises. If I could give it negative stars, I would, since it doesn't teach us but confuses us."
1,This book belongs in the fireplace!,"I do not recommend this to anyone trying to learn discrete mathematics for the first time (or any other time). The author of this book leaves out much too many details. This book is much too vague. Even the solutions provided are brief. Not much insight, not enough examples. Combine this book with a bad teacher, and you will have an extra difficult time passing a discrete math course. Why should about one-fourth of the students take this course 2 or more times? This book could be used for reference, but why bother? Get a better book instead. Look elsewhere for better explanation of the concepts so important to computer science."
1,One of the worst math books I have ever used,"I had a very strong mathematical background coming into college, and it's a good thing I did. This book managed to take concepts I understood very well coming into my discrete math class and make them confusing. The examples are not well explained and the text itself is very unintuitive. I just ended up skipping the reading and doing the problems. If you have any sort of discrete math experience, don't bother with this book. If you don't, try to find something better."
1,Worst math book on the planet!,This is the worst math book I have ever encountered. I had to buy it for my Discrete math class. The examples are vague and and leave you wondering how the solution was reached. Ross & Wright should be banned from writing math books. Don't waste your money on this book. I absolutely hate it!
1,horrible,This book is very hard to understand. The author writes this from his mind set only. There are no answers to any of the questions in the back. Every other discrete math book I have seen and used far surpasses this one.
4,Half Good,"The reason I rate this four stars is because the two DVD set has one 5 star and one three star move. ""Bicentennial Man"" is Science-Fiction at its best. Innovative, thought-revoking and humorous. Robin Williams is perfectly cast.""Mission to Mars"" is vague and convoluted. I like Gary Sinise but not in this and Jerry O'Connell is less than par in his part.. The Disney attraction from whence comes the name is more exciting.However, it's worth the purchase to get ""Bicentennial Man."""
2,Not one of their best works.,"Bestselling husband and wife author-team Judith Michael has situated this familiar midlife, ""coming of age"" tale in a truly unique location. Colorful descriptions of Chinese culture and atmosphere will certainly infect some readers with the travel bug. But, while Miranda's character is well-developed and likable, Li's borders on stereotypical, and at times the threats to their relationship seem artificial. The ending also seems somewhat weak and wishy-washy for such a promising storyline. Not to give away the ending, but after 10 days of knowing each other, Miranda and Li struggle with the implausible -- one page has her staying in China (what about her kids in the US?) and the next page has him leaving China and moving to the US. Make up your minds! Unfortunately this is not one of the authors' best works, but it is entertaining if you are interested in Chinese culture and people.-Sharon Galligar Chance"
2,Not up to their usual standards!!!,I struggled through the first 150 pages since the book bogged down with food descriptions and was very slow moving. It did get a little better the second half. The ending was to be expected. I enjoyed their first books. You couldn't put them down. You CAN put this one down!!
3,"Unsatisfied, but could here be hope in a sequel someday...","I like this author's past works, but this book was not very good. It is very stereotypical of Asians and as a Asian myself, its almost offensive. Its a negative portrayal of Asians and totally unnecessary. Plus the woman in the book is argumentative, too sensitive, close minded and racist. The descriptions of China were very good, however. Maybe the authors can redeem themselves by writing a sequel which addresses these problems and everyone lives happily ever after?"
1,A Certain Smile,"Like most of the reviewers, I agree that this was not the best work by the husband and wife team. I was greatly disappointed. It seems like I waited a long time for a new Judith Michael book to be released and this one was not worth the wait. The characters were flat, the story line implausible and the ending contrived. I wish I read the reviews before I bought the book!"
1,They Need to Try Again,"One of the worst for this writing team. Where's the beginnning, middle and especially the end of this book..."
1,Did the authors use a trip to China as a business expense?,"I usually like the writing team of ""Judith Michael"", but this was absymal. It really seemed to me that all they wanted to do was take a trip to China and write it off as a business expense for ""research"". Not to give away the ending, but after 10 days of knowing each other, the principal characters struggled with the implausible--one page she was staying in China (what about her kids in the US?) and the next page he was leaving China and moving to the US. The ending was utterly unsatisfying."
3,Not up to the usual standard.,"""A Certain Smile"" was an interesting book but not as good as some of the previous books by these authors. I did enjoy the food descriptions throughout the book, even though other readers could not stand them. I wish the ending had been a little more complex and workable. I enjoyed the characters of Miranda and Li, however, I could not stand Sheng. Miranda's children should have been in the picture a lot more than they were."
2,An easy book to put down.,"Also an avid fan of this writing team, this book doesn't compare. It's took me 2 weeks to get to chapter 7...an easy book to walk away from. There is monotonous detail without depth, potentially interesting characters who are superficially developed and a transparent story line. I don't know how this product slipped past Judith & Michael's own quality control."
4,A must for anyone in a stepfamily.,"You will find yourself spoken to and about, throughout this book. Are you in denial? I didn't know I was until reading this book. It is truly difficult being in a stepfamily, but this book helps you to cope with issues you don't want to address."
1,"NOT AN 8"" PAN!!!!","Okay, yes I know, it is only an $8.00 springform pan. I knew the quality would not be top of the line and it isn't although I have seen worse pans for more money. I needed at least 4 extra 8"" pans to get 60 cheesecakes done in the next 2 days. This pan is exactly 7"" and 1"" makes a HUGE difference when the cakes will be all lined up together and sold for the same amount. These will be going back to amazon and I am off to find some 8"" springforms. What a waste of time."
4,"Classic tale, beautifully illustrated.","Just about everyone knows the story of the Gingerbread Man. Contrary to what the movie SHREK shows, The Gingerbread Man was not a kind, Tiny Tim-like creature. Instead, he's a nasty little piece of baked goods that runs away from his creators, teases everyone he meets, and pushes others in wells, and knocks over their picnic baskets. Granted the Gingerbread Man had every right to run away from the little old lady and little old man, they probably would have eaten him if they caught him. But all the teasing and dangerous pranks he does later are uncalled for. Anyway, enough rambling. This story contains ths classic fairy tale of the Gingerbread Man as told and illustrated by Richard Scarry. Like all of Scarry's works it is beautifully illustrated. A great book."
2,Confusing,"This is a cute kit. It looks & seems to work like Play-Dough. I'm confused, though, as to the ""soap"" part. The dough is actually soap. But I can't figure out if the kids are supposed to play with it in the tub (it seems like the dough would just get all wet & sloppy and start to dissolve) or just play with it elsewhere and make soap shapes to use later in the tub (but there's not very much dough and it would get used up quickly). This does not come with any directions on or inside the box to explain it. The company's webside (itsoutrageous.com) doesn't have any info either. My guess is we'll end up using the molds with our Play-Dough"
1,What a piece of Junk!,The box makes it look like you can make cute soaps with the molds. All kind of soap fun. There was 2 3X5 little pieces of paper. 1 with mold instructions and the other for how to cut off the top of the gel pens. Unanswered questions:1. How long until the molded soaps get hard?2. Can the soft play-soap be used as soap?3. What the heck is the gel soap for? Can it be used in the mold?4. Foam pads? I would assume it is for a work surface to work with the play-soap?5. Soap crayons: Can they be used to mark on the tub without leaving stains?I would not recommend this to anyone! It is a piece of junk! I am returning mine!
1,Rip-off,"No real directions. No pictures demonstrating how the product is used. VERY confusing. Packaging is eyecatching, and LOOKS interesting, but what a disappointment when you open it up, ready to play..."
3,"fun, if you prep the molds first!","Our daughter likes this thing. It is finicky. We were able to successfully mold our soaps by using the following tips:1. Make sure that the soap ""dough"" is about the consistency of molding clay. Add water in tiny amounts in necessary to make the soap workable.2. Spray molds for the soap with cooking spray to prevent the soap from sticking...especially to the small areas like feet and ears.3. roll the soap into a log and press lightly into the half of the mold on the platform to ensure the soap gets in to the mold well. Press the lever down and bring the top half over the mold bottom. Compress fully and then remove the top/lever immediately. You should be able to get a well formed soap ""critter"". Trim edges and allow to dry.Good Luck!"
1,Doesn't Help,"I rarely return things but this product went straight back to Sephora. It didn't make my hair softer, smoother or add shine. It just dampened it."
1,A Piece of Junk. I don't even know why Amazon is offering it.,"My stripper fell apart after two uses. I paid $5 for it and learned a valuable $5-lesson. If you want to go cheap, you'll get cheap! Amazon should not be offering this kind of imported junk!"
1,Horrible!,"I got this as part of the cold heat cordless soldering iron offer and found out that after literally 5 - 10 uses it completely fell apart! Even during its few uses it didn't strip wire as well as advertised, however the built in wire cutters performed admirably for what its worth, save yourself some time and possibly money and buy a real wire stripper instead."
2,wire stripper,not worth the money. Easier to use a pocket knife or old fashion plier type stripper. You can squeeze these together multiple times and the wire won't strip.
3,It was....OK,"Obviously the girls are hot and naked. That's a given. The only problem is that the movie was shot like a behind the scenes feature at a photo shoot. If you like that kind of thing pick it up, otherwise, you might want to pass on this one."
3,Okay overall....,I enjoyed some of the songs on the cd but overall the music was okay. I got out of it what was expected.
3,One of 1993's most surprising R&B CDs.,"This CD was one of 1993's most surprising new releases as these guys certainly owed more to 1970s Soul than contemporary R&B or New Jack Swing and they weren't afraid to let it show. While this album can't be compared to classic albums by such legendary groups like The Spinners, The Dramatics or The O'Jays it was one of 1993's most impressive R&B CDs by a male vocal group. Yes, this is (for the most part) heavily overproduced but at least the vocals shine through."
4,One of the better early 90's R&B smooth CDs.,"During the early 90's, there were a bunch of R&B boy groups that came with some very smooth sounds to get up close and personal to. H-Town was among them. The way the last three tracks, ""Knockin Da Boots"", ""Come Back"" and ""Baby I Wanna"", segue into each other is too mellow for words. Other CDs to own from this genre include Intro, Shai, UNV, R.Kelly featuring Public Announcement and Solo! All are must haves."
2,This does not include any MAPS!,"It is the points of interest only and NO MAPS, it was almost useless to me."
4,"Good, but can dry out some.","These pens are good. I got them for my birthday from one of my little sisters, and I love them. They are amazingly easy to write with. They are not my favorite product from Uni-Ball, I definately think that Uni-Ball has better products. But these are really good pens.One thing that I have figured out though in my first few hours of using these, is that you have to keep the lid on them. I had some problems using these for a little bit because I had left the lid off of one and the tip had dried.So keep the lid on these, and I think that they will work fine."
2,A long career is not expected.,"This CD features the theme songs of WCW wrestlers, circa 1992. The wrestlers who have their entrance music on here are: Ron Simmons, Sting, Cactus Jack, Jake Roberts, The Freebirds, Rick Rude, Johnny B. Badd, Dustin Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat, Barry Windham and The Steiner Brothers. Most of these songs are pretty ridiculous. Needless to say, there was not a Slam Jam 2, despite this being billed as the ""Greatest Wrestling Album Ever!""."
3,The quantity is enough,"Because this is 220 grit, wearing off is not as obvious as other 100 or below grit papers. Such that I can use it for a relative OK time. Still wish I got the 7x paper."
5,replacement door handle for Camry,affordable and a big improvement once that handle breaks off and you need a new one!
4,Bonus DVD is GREAT!!!,"Buy this for the bonus DVD. Manson's videos are very artistic and unique. There are over a dozen videos on this DVD. However, this greatest hits disc is sadly missing a few vital songs.. any Manson fan knows whats songs these are. I'm not going to be the umpteen person to say what I believe to be ""their best of"". I guess most of the songs are there if you count the ones that are not on the CD, but appear on the DVD. One of my favorite songs is ""Down in the Park"" which appears on the ""Lunchbox"" CD single. In short, fitting all the best songs recorded by Manson on one disc is ludicrous."
3,Manson's Greate$$$$$t hits!,"I wasnt really impressed with the track selection for this album, although obviously the songs chosen were Manson's most commercially sucessful. There's definitely some key omissions from this collection (the most notable in my opinion being Portrait's ""Cake and Sodomy""). However,even though the album is a little bloated with post Anti-Christ stuff, it's still a solid compliation, and one id recommend to any casual fan. Perhaps Lest We Forget will serve as a good introduction to Manson's brilliant music for people who never caught on and inspire them to go out and buy previous albums from the Manson catalogue. I highly recommend the debut Portrait of An American Family (the only Manson album I still listen to on a regular basis), the Smells Like Children EP, and the epic Anti-Christ Superstar."
4,It's just good...,"I am a huge fan of Manson, his music is something you can sing to and enjoy, he likes to put on a show and his life seems to be full of excitment and torment.Yeah this CD seemed like an attempt at brining in the dough and I am pretty sure it did, if your a fan you bought it, he should have waited a few more years to put out a Greatest Hits, like when he's too old to dress in his manly corsets and wear his platforms and his hair starts to fall out.I really really love this CD/DVD set because well, you got the DVD, but ALAS I was fooled into thinking I would get the S(aint) video... I didn't. It said so on the sticker on the wrapper, but did I get it? NO!If you like videos and you love Manson this is a good CD, it's fun, you can listen to a few of your favorite tunes without changing CD's, and it's fun."
3,"Upset, yes. Disappointed, yes.",I enjoyed this cd very much until after 2 days after my purchase I saw there was a version on his site with the sAINT video and personal jesus one. I wanted to see the saint one not really caring for the personal jesus but I was still very angry. I was upset that foreign countries got the goods and we were banned. The cd was good except for 2 songs but thats ok. I'm still grieving over my loss and how I should have ordered on amazon.co.uk. Just make note before buying that we get ripped in the states.
3,Long Time Manson Fan,"A best of Album? Manson is at his downfall.Most of the songs on the album are from Holywood, Golden age of grotesque and Tainted love is on there.In my opinion MOST this album is not worthy to be labeled ""the best of""."
3,Is it just me or did we get screwed?,"Okay, I love Manson(in other words a bit of a fanatic) but this greatest hits thing kinda screwed us over. Two of my favorite songs by Manson are (s)Aint and Personal Jesus and the U.S. version just banned them, so I didn't even buy it(...yet I'll end up doing so eventually)."
4,"Lest We Forget, The Best of Marilyn Manson","I know we didn't get everything the import cd/dvd set did, but I still love it. The cd has some of his best songs from his hard industrial rock, goth and glam. I love watching the dvd, even though we didn't get all of his videos, there are a couple of hidden eggs on it, such as the makings of the mObscene video and an alternative video version of Disposable Teens. This collector's edition is worth the extra money and I highly reccomend this to everyone."
5,Gran disco!!,"Gran dosco invcluyendo el video de Saint que es muy sexual, manson está jerking off frente a una mujer...... esta muy bien, pero faltaron temas que me hubiera gustado oirlos remasterizados, como el mechanical animals o coma white......... Buy it overall the images are very cool, the videos saint, sweet dreams, get your gunn are excelents and a great booklet........ ¡¡¡Viva Manson!!!!"
2,CHEAP!!!,"The video for ""(s)AINT"" will NOT be appearing on the albums in general distribution and many stores will not accept returns of opened music. If you wish to have the banned video, you will have to order it through the official Marilyn Manson store. This is due to Interscope's refusal to have anything to do with the video."
4,Marilyn Hits!,"The self-proclaimed ""anti-Christ"" raises his head on this record with a number of grotesque hits. Many like to bash the band for the images they portray, but the message, with its delivery, are not for shock's sake. Marilyn Manson is the Ziggy Stardust of our generation, and for many, the only one out there with a true voice. This collection explores this icon of many introverts. From launching hits like ""The Beautiful People"" to ""This Is the New Hit,"" the record is heavy as predicted, excluding Soft Cell cover ""Tainted Love,"" yet including the Eurhythmic's ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These)."" This is a catalogue of what makes him such an important figure of rebellion. Get it with the special DVD; he's as exciting visually, if not more."
5,Best Of Marilyn Manson,This is a great package with hit songs and a dvd with almost every music video is in this collection.Few soundtrack rarities like Tainted Love & Long Hard Road Out Of Hell.There's only one new song recorded for this compilation that would be Personal Jesus.Must have for fans of Marilyn Manson.
5,A Great Mix of Manson's Best Work,This greatest hits cd is worth it for any Manson fan out there. Loaded with 17 excellent songs and if you decide to buy the cd with the dvd as well then it has all his music videos from all of the albums(its worth the extra $) Unfortunately it didn't have every video like Tainted Love or (S)aint. Overall it is worth buying.
5,ONE OF THE BEST GREATEST HITS ALBUM EVER!!!!!!!!,"When anyone would mention Marilyn Manson to me i would say that i hated the band. but that was before i had heard any of thier work. yes, i admit i was a stuck up prick back than, but now i've heard them and i've got to say they're amazing! when i heard ""personal Jesus"" on the radio i was blown away. i'd never known Marilyn Manson was this good because i had refused to listen to them. after hearing the song only twice i got the record. and it is amazing. i can't belive i ever hated the band! all of the songs on the best of are great! i can't get enough of them. my favorites are ""mOBSCENE"", ""Personal Jesus"", ""The Dope Show"", ""The Love Song"", and ""Rock Is Dead"". Brian Warner is one of the best frontmen in the world. his raw power is amazing and the energy of his songs blows me away. after hearing this best of i am most defiantly getting everthing else the band has done."
4,Lest We Remember,"Some of the songs on this album I had already heard before. The rest of them were alright. This is my third album. It is likeable if you are a fan of Marilyn Manson. ""Lest We Forget"" is not precisely my most favorite of his albums, but I enjoy it. ""Sweet Dreams"" is just a song that is in his version. I don't care for that song, as I predicted to myself how it would sound if he sung it. In case you don't like this kind of music, don't buy it. I bet a few people even think it is anti-semetic. Most people just don't understand that Brian Warner{Marilyn Manson} is a very intelligent man and it's just his music that sounds this way."
1,A real dingleberry of a cd.,"I can't believe that anything this freak does gets any positive reaction.Manson's music,if you can call it that, makes one think what would happen if somebody would play dodgeball in a busy street.It promises to be interesting but in the end you know it's gonna suck.The only thing that i can think of that would describe this trash is if somebody takes a dump and after flushing, a few sh*t nuggets remain giving you the same results of anything that manson would put out as music."
4,so close,"i love marilyn manson, and this album should really get 5 stars, except it's missing one song... the death song from the holy wood album. *sigh* otherwise, how could you not buy this album?"
1,SCAM!!!!!!,"Honestly, this album is such (...). The whole selling point was the video for sAint and it's not even on the album. I wish I would have known that the only way to get it is from the Manson store. If you want sAint then buy it from the Manson store. If sAint was on it I would have given this a much higher star rating but now a 1 because it is still missing several videos from the Manson collection. What makes it even worse is that you have to buy this one anyway because the one you get from the Manson store only comes with the DVD for sAint. So you have to spend almost triple the amount one normally would for a CD."
3,Die hard fans will resent this one...,"I am die hard Manson fan. Even though the songs in this best of are very good, its made to attract the mainstream audience. All the MTV played singles are here. There are a thousand others that deserve a worthy mention."
2,Just another singles collection,"Has there ever been a record worthy of the title ""greatest hits"" or ""best of""? Probably not since Queen. Most old Manson fans would be quite disappointed with this disc, as it contains about 65% material recorded after Antichrist Superstar, which most fans would tell you was the last true Manson album. It's the same thing over and over. They throw in most of the singles, a few covers here and there, and you've got your ""best of"" album.Don't bother with this one, even if you're new to Manson. This is a terrible representation of his work. 2 songs included from his first 2 albums... not a good representation at all."
1,Dont buy this DVD if you want ALL the videos.,"How many freakin' versions of this stupid release will there be for greeds sake?!?!?This 'Collector's Edition' does NOT include the 4 BEST videos (""Personal Jesus""/""(s)AINT""/""Tainted Love""/""Astonishing Panorama of The End Times"")The only reason I bought it was for the Tainted Love and Astonishing Panorama videos, which are not included. WTF!?!Mr Manson was on TV a few days ago saying ALL of the videos were included with the exception of (s)AINT! Apparently he is just as much of a 'corperate jerk-off' as the rest of them. Liar!What a scam. If I could return it I would do it right now."
4,"Mac problems, then success! Strange!","I got this adapter years ago and it worked beautifully on my old Mac (upgraded to Panther a few years ago). I got a newer mac (G5) and it worked great on that (still had Panther). Then I upgraded to Tiger and lost my printing ability.I was without my HP Laserjet 4050 for about a week until I came across a Belkin network USB hub which I scarfed up for only $10 (selling for $99 on Belkin's web site!) and found the software and plugged it in. Worked great with my small home network.With fingers crossed, I plugged the parallel printer adapter and WHOOOPEEE it worked. I couldn't believe it. Takes a bit longer to ""think"" but well worth it.So if you're a Mac owner and this printer adapter won't work for you, try getting that USB network hub, it's pretty cool in itself and made me happy to have my laserjet back.Any questions, you can email me, I know how frustrating it can be to try to solve a problem like this.lovesalsa@cox.net"
1,USB Parallel adapter fails my criteria,"No peripheral or software should ever take more than 15 minutes to install and make work. If it does it is an ""anti-productivity"" tool. Life is too short to waste hours overcoming the deficiencies of poor design and confused ? market claims. Example, setup instructions direct user to power up, put in a CD, and connect the cable. Well, it came with an ""installation floppy"" that only contained uninstall overlays. There was no CD! VEry bad sign. I tried everyting. Could not even do basic trouble shooting because too many possible variables. Question is, how does one print with a PC that only has USB ports?"
1,Don't waste your time and money,"Unfortunately, I ignored the advice of the other people who rated this product, and I bought this item. I followed the installation instructions to the letter. All of the settings were set just as they were supposed to be according to the installation instructions, but my LaserJet 4L would not print. In all, I spent about 2 hours trying to get this item to work. What a waste of time. Even the uninstall process doesn't work--I had to reinstall my original print driver to get my printer to work again."
1,Not worth the hassle,"I bought the Mac compatible version of this product and was sorely disappointed on many levels. Although the instructions are explicit and easy to follow, the procedure didn't work. I had to install the software first and then hook up the cable. The software was a breeze to install, and my laser printer did work. But it cut the print quality from 600dpi down to 300dpi. It also slowed down the printing process, hanging up after printing a mere two pages.The next day, I booted my system and turned on my printer. I worked on a document and tried to print it out. It didn't work. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions, and it still didn't work. Eventually, I wound up setting aside my laser printer and buying a cheap inkjet with a USB port. I'm hoping somebody will produce a better adapter in the near future, but I'm not holding my breath."
2,BELKIN USB - F5U002 no good for Windows 7,Works fine on my XP system. Will not work on my Win 7 system.That's what I should have learned by reading reviews but didn't read enough before buying.That's the bottom line and the reason for writing this review.Belkin site tells you nothing that I can find. Guess I'll stay away from them henceforth.
1,USB Parallel Port adapter - different maker same problems,"Living in Switzerland, I bought a like device from a local multiple store. It would not work with my HP DJ 720C but did work with my Canon BJC 250C. In addition, from this same store I bought a 4 to 1 USB switch (to connect up to 4 PC's to one printer). This box worked with the motherboard USB's but happily blew the O/P driver circuits of my dual port plug in adapter - PCI to USB - card. It's clear the market is supplying shoddy USB products - anyone know of a USB User Group? we need to pool our data and get to manufacturers and suppliers. (I also have many years experience as an electronics engineer)."
1,"Agree with ""Electronics Fan from Columbus,Georgia"" re:Epson","We also tried the Belkin F5U002 USB Parallel Printer Adapter. Actually, two of them on seperate pc's with identical OS (Win98) and printers (Epson Stylus Color 600)After several hours, of trying to install/restart/go back to step 2/etc, we gave up and uninstalled everything and went surfing for problems and ended up here. This cable will NOT work with the Epson Stylus Color 600, so don't waste your time."
1,These devices are junk.,"Ditto stevec50's comments. As an engineer, I couldn't get the device to work, either. To make matters worse, if you have your bidirectional printer switched ""on"" when you restart your machine, you get a Blue Screen. Belkin's latest driver upgrade (October 1999) does not resolve any problems (even though the Readme text says it does), and their technical support is clueless. My recommendation is to find another route for your parallel devices, such as an A-B switch, an autoswitch, or by adding another ISA parallel port card. Beware of the latter, though. My new Micron Millennia Max 733 has no ISA slot! (I was told that is the way of the future - no ISA.)"
4,works great but don't leave in standing water,"This product works great. I love it b/c it gives tarts and quiches a nice fluted edge, cooks evenly, and has NO Teflon coating (a health concern since studies have shown it leaches and scrapes off into food and may be linked to memory loss).However, since it's NOT made of stainless steel or aluminum you do NOT want to leave it in standing water. I left mine to soak for a few hours, forgot about it, and found the beginnings of rust around the edges (which cleaned up quite easily with dish soap and elbow grease).This pan does cook great, I will get much use out of it! The bottom pops up easily reveling the crispy crusty buttery edge and rests easily on a plate for a beautiful presentation, and EASY serving.Bake ware without Teflon is becoming hard to find, so I was thrilled when I found this specialty shape! Plus, the price is right!"
5,Jackie Coking class,Best tart pan I have ever used easy to use and heats perfectly cleans up in seconds very happy with this purchase
2,Edges are too sharp,"I'm throwing this pan away because it's impossible to wash it without feeling like I'm cutting my hands open. The edges are very thin and very sharp and it's just too painful to use. It's too bad, because the tarts I have baked in it came out well and released cleanly, but I can't abide the pain of handling it."
5,like no other gloves,"I use these gloves all the time for gardening. Whether I'm pulling weeds or shoveling, my hands stay protected. They are not water proof so your hands will get wet, but the gloves have remained in great shape despite the abuse I put them through. I was skeptical about getting the light color because I didn't want to ""dirty them"", lol. But I am glad I did because they keep my hands cool during the summer heat (my old dark gloves absorbed a lot of heat and made my hands very sweaty). Once I used them and got them dirty , I got over the whole ""trying to keep them clean"" phase. All I do is rub my hands (w/gloves) under the sink and they are as good as new (well, almost)"
4,"great tasting meat stick, a little spicy","Really tasty, but a little too spicy for me. Of course, I ate a half-dozen at a time. It didn't sit well with my insides. I suspect it has red pepper in it."
3,Good Enough,"McMath's book on Populism at the turn of the 20th century is good enough in that it covers the basics. Like another reviewer said, most likely you are not picking up this book to read for fun so, with that in mind, as a book assigned for a class it meets expectations. I read it for a class and, as a History major, I have read worse (trust me!). For his credit, McMath does attempt to make the subject as interesting as he possibly can. All that said, if it's for class, read it because you're paying good money for that course; however, if you're wanting a good book to read on Populism for leisure, keep looking."
2,You'll need lots of coffee,"The best thing I can say about this book is that it's not long. But it certainly felt longer than it was. I read this book for a class, and I'm not sure if I should blame the authors here because the subject matter is simply dreadful. If you find the Populist movement interesting, you may be able to tolerate this book because it's not overly complicated. However, if you're hoping that McMath turned a dry subject into a fairly interesting read, you'll be disappointed. I had trouble staying awake while I read this."
1,I bought a different RCA unit with the same display...,"In March of 2006, I purchased a RCA RP3720, which has been discontinued. But judging by the photo of this product, and the feature set, I'd say it is the same clock. The display, which is why I am writing this review, looks identical in the photo.About three weeks ago, a few segments on the number display began to fade. This morning, I noticed more segments are fading, and the original faders are now completely burned out. This after less than 2-1/2 years of use. I am fairly dissatisfied with my purchase."
2,"Worked fine for 6 months, then LCD started going out...","Got this as a Christmas present last year. It worked fine for about 6 months (even though the screen was like a spotlight at night)...and then the LCD started going out. First it was a part of the last digit, then the buzzer indicator light went out on the 1st alarm. It was an okay clock...too bad it wasn't very durable."
1,Electronics failed within one month,"This alarm clock seemed perfect - large display, easy to understand and use buttons - automatic dimmer. Unfortunately, the switch to set the first alarm failed within a few weeks (it started setting the time instead of the alarm). A week or so later, the snooze period started flaking out - sometimes it was the standard 9 or 10 minutes, sometimes it was just one. The other annoying thing is the radio tuning would creep (from AM 1490, to AM 1491, to AM 1492, etc.), and every time it changed, the display would change from alarm to radio. In summary, good usability, bad engineering!"
4,Pretty nice clock,"1. The led dims when the lights are out and gets brighter when the lights are on.2. The nap feature is pretty nice, don't have to set an alarm.3. Dual wake, alarm can be set two different time on the same day. Could have been useful if it was programmable to different day.4. The alarm gradually gets louder, so you don't get the crap scared out of you every morning.5. You can set your own snooze time."
1,Awful,"I really have begun to hate this thing.While I like the blue dsplay and the fact it's dimmable, I hate that it shows which radio station it's on instead of the time and I completely detest how hard it is to turn off the nap feature after I accidentally hit the button. I never use it...I'm getting a new clock ths weekend."
1,A piece of junk right out of the box,"While I didn't buy a RCA home theater or TV, just a little ol' Clock Radio (RP5435R), I cannot believe RCA sells such a piece of malfunctioning junk under their name. The internal electronics are way out of whack. Right out of the box, it wouldn't keep the time showing, but would only show the radio station unless it was manipulated by putting the AUX on. When the alarm goes off, it won't show the time, just the radio station. The radio station frequency constantly oscillates, and is no where near the station it is playing. Then it started waking me up randomly in the middle of the night where I certainly didn't set the alarm for. This was right out of the box, and yes, I fully read the instructions. It goes back to the store today."
2,When it works it is good,"I like many features, like the alarm starting out quiet and slowly getting louder.I don't like that sections of the digits have started to go out so I can't tell if it's 9 or 10 o'clock."
1,This clock will break,"Ive bought 2 of these clocks. The first one broke promptly after I bought it, i figured it was just a fluke. I've had the second one for about a year and the numbers have almost all burnt out. Dont waste your money."
3,Decent radio,"While this is not the greatest radio ever made, it does sure the purpose I need it for. The only real problems I have run into in that when there are electrical applicances near it, they interfere with the reception especially in the AM band.The radio itslf is a sharp looking unit and it is very easy to read the display. It is worth the money and delivers what you would expect from a radio of this price."
2,Good concept with a few hassles,"I really liked the clock when I brought it home. The features are great, the alarms are easy to set, the display is easy to read. I've had some problems with it though that has me looking for a replacement:--The biggest problem is the sound of static coming from it all night. The radio is off, and I can't quite figure out if the sound is coming from the speakers or the circuit board. Maybe this is the sound it makes before the LED fails?--The display is too bright even at the dimmest setting. I think they tested in the lab by turning the lights off, but never left time for their eyes to adjust to the dark.--Sometimes I wake up thinking it's 9:05 in the morning only to realize the unit is displaying a radio station of 90.5, though the radio is off.The nap feature is nice, and the button placement is great. I don't know if my problems are due to unit-to-unit variation or design flaws."
2,"Good features, but poor quality","I've gone through two of these alarm clocks in less than 6 months. While this alarm clock has all of the features I'm looking for, they are so poorly built that I'd avoid buying one. The first clock I bought from Target lasted only about 2 months before it just completely died one morning. No lights, no nothing. I'm guessing the components they're using are very cheap and burn out easily. But I thought maybe it was just a fluke unit, so I bought another one. This time the buttons are breaking. One of the alarm buttons started working intermittently, until it finally broke completely. Again, another sign of poor components.I love the variable snooze time, the nap function, and the gradual wake up alarm, plus the auxiliary jack is nice. ]"
4,"Nice clock, works great","I got this from amazon after I had to return one to Target. The one from Target made an annoying periodic sound so I had to take it back. They did not have another so I got it at Amazon and it works just fine. The autoset worked, the line input worked, it just worked."
1,Big issues with this alarm,"This clock has two huge issues for me that way outweigh the positives.DISLIKES:Numbers are WAY too bright. The only way I can sleep comfortably with this near the bed is to face the clock away from me (which is extremely inconvenient).The NAP function is a huge flaw for me. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to turn off the alarm and hit NAP instead. And once it's on, good luck trying to figure out how to turn it off. So more often than I would like (which would be zero), when my GF gets up before me, 20 minutes later, the stupid alarm goes back on. Even when I am coherent enough to realize I accidentally hit NAP, by the time you figure out where the stupid button is and remember which button you have to hold down for how long to turn it off, you are pretty much wide-awake.LIKES:Easy alarm setNice two alarm featureCool blue numbersNice auto set feature"
1,Don't buy it!,"Do not buy this product. I had this thing just long enough to be a few days over the return policy time limit before I realized that the subtle crackling I was hearing over the past month wasn't in my head, it was in this thing. It isn't consistent-- it might go an hour just fine. But then when it does ""act up"", every few minutes or so, it spits out what sounds like just a couple of ""crick crick""s, and NOTHING short of unplugging the thing will make it stop. You'll find yourself at 5am wondering-- what IS that subtle yet extremely irritating noise? And you'll root around for 10 minutes before you trace it back to this thing."
3,dont accidentally hit NAP,"It's ok but if you accidentally press NAP, it is going to alarm in 20 minutes no matter what. you can't make it stop. Never accidentally hit NAP while trying to reset the thing for waking up earlier because not only will you be waking up earlier, you're going to get woken up in 20 minutes too."
1,"Nice features, poor manufacturing","The nap function is nice. The automatic time set is great, too, but...within two months, the digital readout for the hour partially burned out. You couldn't tell if the clock read 5 of 6 and 8 or 9. Another light burnout made it so you couldn't tell if the alarm was set and on or not. That's pretty shoddy manufacturing, especially considering our previous clock radio (Panasonic) lasted for 15 years before the time set buttons fell off. We are buying a new clock to replace the RCA."
3,Ehhh-okay,"We needed a dual-alarm clock, and I liked the fact that the lights were blue, and that the numbers were big enough to see across the room without my glasses, so after reading the reviews, I ordered this clock.Well, the lights are WAY bright--we have to cover it up with a folded piece of paper to block out the intense glow. The dimming feature doesn't work so well.A couple of months after receiving the clock, sure enough, one of the alarm lights blinked out, just like one of the reviews said. But the clock is still usable...you just have to make extra sure you have the right alarm on--annoying beeps or soft radio music--so that you aren't nastily jarred awake. :)Some of the features like ""Nap"" are easy to set by accident, so keep the instructions handy.Not a bad product for the price...just a few blips make it not perfect."
1,"Won't work long, poor build, marginal design","This clock has always felt 'flimsy.' Now, after only 1 year of service, some of the LED segments indicating the time have completely burnt out. It has been gradual, too: first some segments, then a few more, etc. I can't even tell if the alarm is on anymore.Also, I hear a faint sparking sound when the radio and alarms are totally off, which turned out to be the transformer when the clock was disassembled. Who knows? Maybe voltage/current transients associated with this problem caused the LED segments to burn out.In any case, there is no excuse for the clock breaking down after 1 year of mild service. I won't be replacing it with an RCA.PS The price suggested here for the clock is outrageous."
1,Beware!,"I liked the big display, easy to set-features and the tuning accuracy afforded by a digital tuner. Two problems: if you turn the volume all the way up, you may have total silence from the radio (I missed my flight). Second, after three months the buttons that operate the alarm broke, and broke in a way my tinkering could not fix (the plastic buttons correspond to a mechanism fairly deep below the casing, and they somehow disengaged with normal use). So now its just a radio I keep in my bathroom. Between the cost of the radio and the missed flight to Japan with a nonrefundable ticket, owning this radio cost me $2000. If there is one thing a clock radio should surely do is be at maximum volume when you turn it to maximum volume!"
2,Clock is too bright,Clock is too bright. I ended up moving to the guest bedroom. All other features are great.
2,BAD NEWS - WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO RCA?,I got this clock as a present and it served well for a while and then started displaying the radio station numbers instead of the time. Then the buttons broke.RCA was a name associated with quality - now it is virtually indistinquishable from garbage. The lit numbers burned out and the clock got thrown out. Bottom Line: save your money and buy a Westclox.
4,It's a Clock!,"The clock face is nice and large and I can see it from across the room. We have it in our living room (the satelite box doesn't have a clock). It is nice that it resets itself. The power went out the other day and the clock came back on and reset right away. Otherwise, it is a clock!"
3,Great features - with one exception,"Without repeating all the pros others have listed, I just wanted to say it's a great clock with one problem - the buttons are poorly built.I've had the clock 2 weeks and already the off button is breaking. I have to press it in on an angle and very hard to turn off the alarm. I really hope it doesn't get any worse.If your buttons hold up, this is a really good alarm clock."
2,Too complicated!,"I was looking for an alarm clock that would allow us to enter two different wake times (my husband gets up an hour before I do), but I wanted one that wouldn't require me to re-read the instructions every time I used it. Unfortunately, this one is too complicated."
3,"Works, but...","I bought this alarm clock when I moved to a new city. Needless to say, it does its work, has an unpleasant, loud beep for an alarm (which makes it a good alarm), and I like the fact that I don't need to enter the time if I unplug it. The numbers are nicely sized, which is good if you need to decipher what time it is when you are still half asleep from across the room.I give it a just ok, because even if I still like it, I wouldn't buy one again because the topmost horizontal line in the numbers stopped working, which is only a problem when I have to determine whether the last digit at the current time is either a 1 or 7..."
2,low quality product,"Have had two of this model.First one was returned after about 4 months of use because when the alarm was activated, the display would blank.Second one looks to be on its way to the rubbish bin after 6 months. Anytime anything electrial is used around it, it switches from displaying the time to displaying the radio frequency or showing a blank screen. First time I miss a meeting due to alarm clock failure, I'm likely to vent my frustrations on this clock.Goods:Very easy to read numbers.Nap feature can be set between 10 and 120 minutes.Easily adjustable snooze.Respectable radio tuner.Graudual volume increase on the buzzer alarm.Bads:Even with dimmer, display is quite bright.Aux. audio in quality (for connecting an MP3 player) is lacking.Overall, I like the features of this clock, but two dead clocks in under a year is unacceptable."
2,I'm just not that old,I'm sure the clock works fine. But the numbers are big. REALLY big. I just don't need a clock that reminds me of a billboard. I sent it back and got the $10 RCA instead which works great.
3,"Nice, but button broke after 2 years","Nice alarm radio, but the alarm-off button broke after 2 years. That part was poorly constructed, so I'll replace it with a different model."
2,great while it lasts,Unfortunately after a period of time the little light bars that make up each number started to burn out. Now whenever it is 7:00 - 8:00 it looks like it is 1:00-2:00. (The top bar of the number 7 is out - if that wasn't very clear). Tried to replace this clock today and can't find anything close to the number size in blue. Too bad. This was the only problem experienced with the clock but it is a major one.
2,Easy but Cheap,"I bought this as a gift for my 83-year-old dad. He found it fairly easy to use and the numbers big enough to see from across the room at night. However, after only a month, the nap and sleep buttons stopped working. I wish I had kept the proof of purchase to return it to the Target I bought it at. Although the warranty is a good for a year, you also need a proof of purchase for that. Collecting on the warranty is also an unhappy prospect, because it requires paying the postage to send it to the manufacturer and waiting an unknown amount of time for the manufacuter to either fix or replace the clock."
3,RCA RP5430 SmartSnooze,"I purchased this item for my wife to replace a high quality atomic clock which was not working properly due to some frequency interference. The RCA clock in question has a sleek and appealing appearance, with sufficiently large enough numbers for those of us who are near and far vision challenged. The radio has a decent enough sound - not Boston Acoustics quality, but good enough to recognize the tune that's waking you up. My one gripe it that the clock has a constant buzz or crackling sound to it. Could have just been a defect, but its enough of a bother to cause me to return the item."
2,Love it...but construction is faulty,"We love all the features of this clock. The alarm is very pleasant, but gets loud enough to wake even deep sleepers. The blue light glows a little too bright, but the color is nice.Main complaint is that after 6 months of normal use it developed an intermittent buzzing sound. The sound comes and goes. It's irritating. Also, although we never use the radio feature, the channel selected would sometimes flash instead of the time. We were able to resolve this by selecting a stronger channel. This happened although the radio was off. So it appears there's some wiring problems.We sent the clock in for warranty two months ago and still haven't received anything back. It's frustrating to be so inconvenienced due to faulty construction. Would have got 5 stars if it had lasted."
5,Great Product,"This is a great alarm clock. The blue numbers add a nice relaxing glow, and it's not too bright for me. The escalating alarm was the selling point for me. I usually turn off an alarm the second it goes off without noticing it. Now that the alarm isn't horribly disturbing, I can actually wake up and realize that the alarm is going off and to consciously hit snooze or off. the other features are really nice ... two alarms, nap feature, radio. Great."
1,Bad design,I've owned this clock for about a year and it just broke on me. The button that turns the alarm on and off just decided to quit working. I believe that this is due to a poor design of this particular button mechanism.I also thought that the numbers are too big and cast too much light in the room even when the clock is in low light mode.
2,Men's Rolex Watch,"I've owned 2 different Rolex watches (both were the Explorer II model in all stainless steel). While they looked great, both lost about 5 minutes per month. Before quartz, Rolex used to brag about how accurate their watches were. And, that was true at the time. But, now that quartz watches have set the standard for accuracy, Rolex no longer makes any public claims about the accuracy of their watches. While a Rolex is a true product of craftsmanship (it takes over a year to create each watch), if you want accuracy, then you'll have to go with a quartz watch.Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 18kt Yellow Gold Diamond Mens Watch 118348"
1,Rolex Submariner,Rolex watches are way over rated. Being mechanical self winding watches my two lose around 30 seconds per day. My son's Seiko varies about 1or 2 seconds per month with the WWV time signal
1,"Good toner, but it stinks ... literally","I purchased this toner with the Alpha Lipoic Acid Cleanser. The cleanser is great, with a nice clean scent. The toner, on the other hand, goes on with a mildly unpleasant smell. However, as it dries, it downright stinks! It's a cross between musty and stinky socks. I e-mailed Dr. Perricone's company to ask if I purchased a bad batch. Their response, was simply - we use natural ingredients without artificial scents or colors. No mention about the bad smell. Find another toner!"
4,Works well as a health tool,"Disclaimer: I didn't buy this product as a waist-cincher, so I can't say how effective it is there. The one I have is 1.5"" less than my natural waist, and as far as I can tell, there's not a huge difference (there is a little difference, and it's nice!).I CAN say that as a waist-cincher, buy based on the hip measurement. The one I have is slightly too large for my hips, and there's a little wrinkle at the bottom of the ribbing. It's fine for my purposes, but it'd be annoying if I were wearing it under a snug skirt.Anyways. What I wanted was something to help with portion control and good posture, and this item works wonderfully for that. It feels solid and comfortable, but there's enough pressure to remind me to stay away from the AYCE, and my posture's much better while I'm sitting at my desk.The only thing is that I'm short (5'2"") and it's a little too long for my torso. Next time I'll have to look for a waist-cincher for petites."
4,Great product,This is a great waist cincher. It fits true to size chart and feels great on my back as we'll as holds my tummy back great! Only reason it is not five stars is because I can still see it under a few of my shirts but its amazing besides that!
5,Nice cincher !,This item does the trick. It's light weight and still gives just enough support. Sizing is pretty close to actual measurements.
3,Waistcincher,The quality of this item is excellent but runs very small. I would order at least one to two sizes larger.
5,Great shaper,"This is by far the best waist cincher out of the three that I have. It is extremely comfortable while maintaining firm support. I have a 30"" waist and I sized down to a S and it's perfect. It instantly took 1.5"" off my waist. I have a Flexees waist cincher that has no support and side wires that would dig into my waist line. I don't have this problem with the Rago cincher though - the shape is very natural and comfy. The only complaint I have is that it is too long but I also have a very very short torso so it's hard to find a cincher that's short enough"
5,Perfect fit,This was a perfect fit and did exactly what I needed it to do. I am a skinny girl but have had 3 boys and of course don't have the flat stomach I had 20 years ago prekids. I needed to hide my pooch while wearing a bridesmaid dress. This did the job nicely and was actually very comfortable to have on. It did tend to roll just a little as I don't have a long torso. Overall wasn't a problem though. So glad these things exists to keep a women looking and feeling great!
4,Works for what I wanted it for.,"I bought this as an alternative to a back-brace. Many of the reviews mentioned how it reminded them to sit up straight, and it definitely does that for me. My back doesn't hurt as much anymore, and I only wear it every other day or whenever I'll be sitting for a long period of time.However, it does tend to bulge a little when sitting, and roll up (where the boning ends) occasionally. (So I personally would only wear this under loose shirts.) I think these issues are more size related though. I went with an XS (I'm a 24 waist, 35 hip) it isn't difficult for me to get on, and I can pull it up and down as needed. I also measured and it only slims me down half an inch, so I think it's just a bit too big. But I am pleased none the less, as Rago seems to make very good quality products."
2,ARGH,"I was hoping that the boning wouldn't contort funny, but, alas, it bends all weird around my hips in the back. I give up. If I want better shape I'm just going to get in shape :/"
5,Perfect!,"I have FINALLY found a girdle that works for my figure!! Hurray!! I wore it to just keep the lumps at bay. So my waist won't go in only to have a muffin top and a belly bulge as I stood on stage for a performance. Helped me feel like I could just perform (not feel restricted in breathing or movedment) and just do my best. I felt confident and joyful. It was comfortable. Well, maybe a little itchy, but I'm really sensitive to that sort of thing, and it really didn't bother me much at all. Didn't notice other than the first time I put it on. I give it 5 stars! Easily!"
3,Wish I'd known better,"I product would have worked better, I think, if I had orderedone a couple inches smaller than my waist size, because it wastoo big, thus not doing the job it was supposed to."
5,if you love to ski/ snowboard Jackson Hole...,"... this is your book. The history of the area is fascinating, but the interviews with the locals really bring this book to life. David Gonzales has collected a plethora of amazing pictures from the area's best photographers, too. Whether you've just visited Jackson Hole or have lived in the area, 'Jackson Hole: On a Grand Scale' brings back great memories of skiing and snowboarding a place that's like no other!"
2,Nice Idea- Poor Quality;-(,"This was a great clock radio, until it started slowly breaking down. I loved this unit at the beginning. The sound quality was very good for a clock radio. There were so many good features. First problem; the battery back never worked, it killed two sets of batteries and never did its job once. Second problem; the CD door and player slowly started to malfunction about 4 months in, I was lucky to get my disk out at the end. The radio reciever was medicore, sometimes I could only get 4 stations to come in instead of 25. If they fixed all of the problems I'd get another one, but instead I'm changing brands to something reliable."
1,Broken CD door and faulty controls,"This clock radio has many great features, and functions well for a few months. It is nice looking too. We bought a second because we liked it so much. Sadly, the CD door and controls quit working on both after a few months. Sometimes mine opens if I pound on it hard enough, and occasionally it will play track one of the CD. Currently one of my favorites is stuck inside. The only working thing left on the units are the dimming digital clocks."
1,Broken in under two weeks,I can't believe that this clock radio went from new to broken so quickly. Purchased 12/16/06; broken 12/28/06.Unbelievable.
2,Just OK,"Controls are confusing and poorly marked, you have to be in the right light to see what the front buttons do. CD door gets light use but seems OK. Sound is good. It just has a poor look and feel overall, I can't recommend this one."
4,Wonderful clock radio,"What I wanted was an alarm clock that didn't have red numbers and didn't wake me up to static-y radio stations or the heart attack inducing blaring alarm most clocks provide. This unit fulfilled everyone of my wishes. Once it's setup (it can be a bit confusing at first), it's day to day use is excellent. It quietly plays whatever music I've placed into the CD tray (a very cool sliding face tray) and even plays the track I want. I now wake up gently instead of being terrified out of my rest each morning.I still have trouble with the auto time set feature, but overall very much worth the money spent."
1,Don't buy it--breaks in a couple of months,"I got this for a Christmas present. Right away, the CD portion was broken--it played CDs too fast, so what came out was chipmunk speed. At the time, I didn't worry about it because I had an mp3 player. I enjoyed the clock for a couple of months, then the CD door broke--not because I was playing CDs, but because when I woke, I confused the CD open/close button (on top of the clock) with the snooze button (at the bottom of the clock). Very poor button placement.A week after the CD door broke, I came in and noticed that the clock screen was blank--the light was on, but no numbers were showing. I couldn't turn on the radio, play the CD. Nothing.I got the gift in January. It completely broke in April.I am never getting it again."
1,what a waste,"in reading others peoples review I felt I must chime in and tell you that after about a year of use... we are talking at night just pressing play for the cd player in my daughter's room, very light use. the CD player stopped playing and the cd door will not open. I think I will have to break the thing to get my miles davis cd back. I am disappointed. It is ugly and not user friendly either. wish I could return it and get my money back. Now I am on amazon looking for a replacement. don't buy it."
5,Great Clock Radio,I have had this radio for over a month. This is a great clock radio with lots of useful features. Good radio reception if you stretch out the power cord like the suggest in the owners manual. The small CD player control buttons on the front are a bit cumbersome to use because you need to hold on to the radio to keep it from moving away from you as you press them. The sound on the weather band is very weak and has to be turned up to be heard. Then if you forget to turn it back down the CD or FM radio sound is too loud. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
1,"Just like the Rest Clock Radio, CD Player & MP3 connection",I purchased this item on amazon and recieved it shortly thereafter. The reason i purchased it because under the advertisement it specifies the unit can play MP3 type CDs. After upteen atempts to record MP3 CDs and testing the unit upteen times.I gave up and realized it ONLY PLAYS REG AUDIO CDS. ?? What ?? Yes You read it. After all that inserting MP3CDs the unit door also decided to stop i had to unplug and replug it a few times before the unit door unjammed.As a tech wiz i say your better off buying a clock radio CD Player with MP3 ( Player connection ) at 1/3 the price with dual alarm and you get what you pay for then being falsely conned into purchasing something electronic that doesnt do specifically what you purchased it to do .i wonder if amazon is aware?
1,Doesn't Work,"This clock radio has been a huge disappointment. I have appreciated the battery backup and the large display,but the CD player stopped working after only a few months. It's also very frustrating that the button to open the CD player is in the place that most people would expect to find the snooze button. All in all, a very disappointing purchase."
1,Doesn't Last,"A coworker and I got the same radio for use in the office. The door on his stopped working properly after 1 year. Mine made it closer to 2 years, but the door doesn't open AND sometimes at random a CD will not play. I get a weird noise instead. Sorry, but I think a nice clock radio should last longer than that."
2,I Don't Recommend it................,"I have this clock for a year now and hate it. The CD no longer works and when you press the button to open it nothing happens, it's stuck permanently. The little buttons on the face of the radio are impossible to see the same silver color little icons that tell you what they do. You HAVE to memorize them or keep the instruction book nearby. The am radio is useless unless you pull the electric cord out and move it around. When you get a good fm station the sound is good. The worst thing is when you wake up it is impossible to find the little button to shut it off because it looks exactly like all the other buttons. Bad design. Why didn't they make that button large and a different color so you can locate it when you just wake up groggy. I'm buying a different clock radio that will let me charge and use my Iphone too!!!"
2,Not too bad...but pretty bad,"I got this Cd/radio player about a year ago. It worked fine for a couple of months. About 2 months ago, the motorized door broke. I don't know how or why, I'm very careful with my electronics, and it broke. The Cd player and every thing worked just fine, but you had to open and close it manually. (Kind of hard to explain...) Just last night, my cat accidentally stepped on the wire and took the plug out, and now it makes a horrible ticking racket. Do yourself a favor and research a better Cd player. Its not that bad of a CD player when it works. It's actually quite a nice one, but unless you want to spend however much it is on a new one every 6 months, get a different one."
2,"Wanted to like it, but can't.","As with many other people, I've had this product for a pretty short time and it's already broken. One day, I went to go switch out CDs and the door refused to open, instead making a hideous grinding sound. To add insult to injury, the CD that was in the player couldn't even play anymore. I really wanted to like this CD clock radio too. I like the display and the options with it. The sound quality was quite nice for what it is and was exactly what I wanted out of it. I liked the ability to plug in my mp3 player and use it with the player. But ultimately, the CD door problem is a dealbreaker. It's just bad design and bad construction. It shouldn't have broken in just 4 months of only moderate use. It shouldn't have broken down in 4 months even if it were heavy use. This absolutely not worth the money I paid for it, much less what retail price on it is. Stay away and find something more reliable."
1,Defective CD door,"I received this clock as a gift, and although I really like how it stands up, after a few months, the thing started to fall apart. It started with a sort of grinding sound each time I opened the CD, which would take multiple tries to actually open it. After a couple of months more, now the CD door fails to open entirely. I can't listen to any CDs, which was the feature I enjoyed the most. I contacted RCA, and of course, they are willing to have me pay for repair, but at that cost and hassle, I might as well just buy a new clock.It's a real pity that this problem seems chronic for other owners. I really like this clock and its many features, but I will probably never buy from RCA again."
3,Clicking noise and door problems solved,"My wife has owned her radio for about 5 years. Two weeks ago, the door began to make a noise as it closed over the CD. My son found that this clicking noise could be stopped if a shim was placed under the door. To the best of my knowledge, a shim about 3/16th of an inch thick worked for her door. You can use a few popsicle sticks stacked upon each other, and taped together, and then taped into place where the bottom of the door tries to go, should do it. The sticks should be small enough to sit on the bottom without sticking out, so that the door can more fully open when it wants to open, but is prevented from fully setting down to the bottom when it wants to close. This shim should be taped into place so that it does not fall out, etc."
2,Big Price for Little Radio...,"I have to agree with most of the other reviews, this product simply just falls flat. For the price, one would expect more... oh so much more! No ear phone/head phone jack... has trouble reading disks... the CD doors jams about every five times I use it... horrible instructions and I have learned through the years, if the manufacturer only warranties the product for 90 days (as with this clock radio), they obviously don't have much faith in their very own product either. I would never purchase another one of these clock radios. It is simply overpriced for what it delivers."
1,Broken CD loading mechanism,We received this unit as a present for our new born. It has now been three months and the CD panel that folds out so you can load your CD's has broken several times. I have been able to get it back working after some time playing with it but it is now broken for good. I would not buy this unit simply based on the factor of too many moving parts to load a CD. Otherwise everything seems to work fine but not being able to play my sons CD's for him is very annoying.
1,Believe all the reviews - DON'T buy it,"This alarm clock's features make it almost perfect. Battery backup, automatic time set, dual alarm, CD player, and sleek design. But just like everyone else's, our CD player quit working within a few months. The door wouldn't open, and even after my husband muscled open the door, it still wouldn't play CDs. What a shame to put such a poor-quality CD player in an alarm clock that otherwise has all the features we need."
3,This doesn't play MP3 discs,"This unit does everything the description claims except play MP3 formatted discs. Currently I go to sleep listening to a MP3 playlist with a $20 MP3 player that's connected to this with a 1/8 inch stereo audio jack, but this means I have to recharge the MP3 player every day. Also I have to really crank up the volume on the MP3 player and the clock radio in order to hear any sound at all (this is probably the MP3 player's fault).My next clock radio will probably have an IPOD dock and I'll buy a cheap IPOD to connect to it."
1,Display Stopped Working,"After less than one year of use, the display for the clock stopped working. When I called RCA to complain and get a replacement, they told me they had no record of my warrantee submission, and that they would do nothing for me without a receipt. Either keep your receipt or look for another product."
3,2nd one,I bought this for my daughter before she was born to play a white noise CD on repeat (all you parents out there know). I had a heck of a time finding a unit that will play one track on repeat all night. I did have a problem with the CD door shortly after I purchased it. However i called RCA and sent it back and they replaced the unit.I have just purchsed a second one for my newest addition despite the problem I had with the door. RCA made good on the product and that is big to me. And again I have looked around for a unit to repeat a CD all night and have come up empty handed.
3,Worth a listen,"I find it hard to peg Low Millions. They have an interesting style. Some of their songs have a traditional rock feel and other have a pop, dancy feel. What I find so interesting is the way this CD jumps from one straight forward rocker into an edgy, dance number without seeming incredibly out of place. I also like their bizarre and often provocative lyrics, and I like Adam Cohen's emotional vocals.Some of you may have heard Eleanor and Statue on your local modern rock station. If you like those songs it might be worth you while and money to pick up this album. Just don't expect the remainder of the tracks to sound exactly like this. Low Millions likes to mix up their style to keep it fresh. If you like the sound of what I have tried to describe, then yeah, give this a chance. They are a little different from the rest."
4,Solid througout,"I got this CD at the same time as I got the new Gorillaz cd as well as Franz Ferdinand's latest. Its now three months later and I am still listening to the Ex-Girlfriends / every song! While I only listen to one or two cuts on the others' releases, this full ""album"" has grown on me and I enjoy every cut. I recently took it to a 3 day meeting with my team and played it during breaks - by the end of the three days everyone wanted to know who it was and wanted to buy it."
1,Not my thing,"I heard one song off this album, Elenor, which is a great song so I bought the album. The rest of the album is a little too ""young"" for my taste. I don't like it when I can predict the lyrics to the song before they happen and I could predict the lyrics in almost every song on this album. Plus, at times I felt this was music for a teen female audience. Just not my cup of tea. I do love the song Elenor, but the rest of the album doesn't do it for me."
1,This kid is a 'hack in training' - famous father does not equal talent for son,"I tried to be fair. I really tried to give this cd a shot. But, come on, folks. Who are we kidding with this one? The lyric writing is so cheesy...who wrote this garbage? Can you believe that his dad is a poet?And the music sounds like an attempt to put together a really cool group of guys and call it a band. These cats are so 'light studio musicians' - zero authentic chemistry. These guys are the kind of musicians that get paid to tell the lead singer he did a good job on stage that night.This fluff/stuff is the reason why 'real bands' get the respect."
3,Maroon 5 Jr.,"If this album broke just a little bit sooner, Maroon 5 could have been Low Millions Jr., but such is life. Adam Cohen does have strong vocals (thanks to the gene pool) and the band is able to put together some catchy songs with decent hooks. The standout tracks are Eleanor and the provocative, Nikki Don't Stop, but everything else sounds as if its been done, so it gets boring fast. Compile that with the fact that this album is called Ex-Girlfriends and is primarily about that very subject. I feel like I'm hearing Songs About Jane II. I wouldn't discourage the purchase, because its fun for a while..."
3,Fairly decent.,"This was not necessarily a typical purchase for me, as I usually prefer other styles. Upon hearing the first few songs, these adjectives sprung to mind ""melodic, slacker, glam"". That's how I would describe it. The first 5 songs are very good and have nice choruses; unfortunately the second half winds it down, and is almost formulaic singer/songwriter stuff. If they would have continued in the same vein as they started, it would have been an excellent release. So, 4 stars for the first half; 2 for the second=3."
5,Tell everyone about this CD,"I can't say enough about how great this CD is. Every song on this album is good. My favorite tracks are Eleanor, Julia, and Diary. This album has it all, the lyrical content equals the musical content. Adam Cohen has crafted such dark and relateable lyrics. They are sexual, they are lamenting, they are sad, they are angry but most of all they Rock."
4,Devil's Backbone,"The "" Devils Backbone"" by Terry C. Johnston is exciting and informative but also a bit boring in spots. I would reccomend it."
4,A decent first book about the Modoc War,"This is fiction, with fictional primary characters, but it deals with very real events in American history. As a first book on the Modoc War I found it very easy reading and thus quite useful."
2,only presta works,Pump works OK with presta valve which is the only reason this pump is getting more than one star. Shrader connection won't work to save my life.
2,Not Good for Higher Pressure Tires (Over 100 PSI),"I had an unfortunate experience with this pump. I thought it was going to be very sturdy at first, but suddenly it would not hold pressure above 120 psi even with me holding the head of it to the valve. This forced me to work the pump a lot to get up to a reasonable pressure. After about five or six uses, the attachment of the tube to the base cracked and wouldn't hold any air. I was so mad at the thing for $40 bucks, that I broke it in two and threw it in the garbage. I guess I can't expect a refund. If you are attempting to pump your tires to over 100 psi, this one doesn't work for long. I am not sure how long it works for less than this, but it the base seems to have fatigue problems also."
1,Murphy,"Works great for presta, when you put it on sharder valve NO air. junk..Park u should be ashamed to sell this crap"
1,I can hardly every get this pump to properly lock a presta valve.,"I always can pump my tires just fine on other pumps, but I can't tell you how much time I've spent trying to get this particular pump to properly lock onto my presta valves. Pump, leak, pump, leak, groan, detach, reattach, lather, rinse, repeat.Ready for a new pump."
1,Broke after roughly 20 uses,"This bike pump is awful. I was pumping my tire when I heard a pop. The bottom tube literally POPPED out at less than 80 pressure! That shouldn't have happened. Guess I shouldn't be surprised when the majority of the parts are connected by plastic screw on pieces. I screwed everything back into place and attempted to pump my tires again, but this time the pressure pushed the handles beyond it's normal range and it nearly smacked my face. Pretty dangerous if you ask me. The pressure gauge also stopped working. I got so upset and fed-up trying to fix this thing, I tossed it....Park Tool...thanks for ruining what could have been a great bike trip for me. If only I could get my money back..."
1,Gauge Doesn't Work,"The gauge on this pump has never worked once. I fill my tires to 120 psi, but the gauge always reads between 40-60 psi. I've been forced to fill my tires based on feel, not knowing how much air is actually in my tires. I thought the gauge might just be broken, so I returned it to the bike shop and they gave me a replacement. But the gauge on the 2nd bike pump has never worked either. It seems that the gauge is not rated for high pressures. I would not waste your money on this pump. I plan to spend some extra money on a good floor pump."
5,Great novel ! A must read...,"The story took place in the heart of Bangkok, Thailand. Tuk-Tuk is a great novel about a man named (Spike) with a heart of gold and strong will to do what it takes to take care of his sick mom. Despite the unfortunate lose of his job, Spike bought an old 3-wheeled taxi (tuk-tuk), with the little savings he had, taking a chance to learn to drive it and make a living to support himself and his sick mom. The story is gripping, heartening, full of surprises and mixed with romance. As you read the story, you will not want to put it down as it keeps you curious and intrigued with fast moving events and surprises... High praises goes to the author, Thomas W. Konkol for a well-written first novel with such a riveting story. I look forward to reading his future novels..."
5,MeatEater,This stuff is pretty good. I used to get the best landjagers from a place in Salt Lake City . . . unfortunetly they have changed their recipe recently; they now taste much like these bavarians.I buy these and stick them in my smoker for several hours to help dry and age the sausages. Then I like to hang them to dry further. I'm hooked on these.
2,Not Really an AIkido Book,I have no problem with the contents of this book but I feel like the title is misleading. This book really has more to do with Leonard's L.E.T. ideas than with Aikido.
2,"Helps to awaken senses, but leaves you desiring more...","A friend found this at a second hand bookstore during the holidays and gave it to me for Christmas. I've been practicing Aikido for only six months and have begun to discover that I'm fascinated by both the martial and spirirtual aspects of the discipline. Thus, my friend's reasoning for this gift.Mr. Leonard does a fine job of presenting some concepts which may awaken a desire to learn more about the philosophy and spirit of Aikido. Unfortunately each phrase or statement which moves in that direction is a bit of sales pitch to participate in his seminars or join his organizations.Not being a California resident and lacking a total interest in sales pitches related to Aikido, I've spent some time doing research of my own and speaking more closely with my Senseis about Aikido's philosphy.Buy this book if you want some inspiration to discover your own path. Otherwise, it's more suited to be the required reading for one of his seminars."
4,Excellent book!,"This book is aimed primarily at non-martial artists, but well worth the read in any case. It is an excellent primer on the art. If you are considering taking up Aikido, this is the best book I have found to help you decide. This book speaks to the spiritual, psychological, and transformative aspects of this beautiful art. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would've liked more,""meat."" (Which is merely a function of my perceptual filters....and I am sure that this book could be taken on many levels) I have been researching Aikido, mostly the non-technique aspects (techniques are best learned from instruction, not a book), because I plan to take lessons. I consider myself very lucky to live near enough to Leonard Sensei to visit his dojo."
4,Superlative for writing letters,"Thick, swart, syrupy ink, a bit grainy, but expressive, feels good as it flows across the page, has an antique look, almost quill like. You might not want to use it for filling forms, legal documents, but for personality, it's perfect."
1,Good thing I don't need a Zebra 0.7 to write this!,"I read the reviews here and I wonder if they could possibly be talking about the same pen. I take my pretty colored pen from the pack, take off the little wax covering at the end and it writes beautifully. The next day I try to use it again and nothing. No amount of scribbling on the page will get it to write again. This happens to every pen in the pack. What secret does everyone else know that I do not? Other than giving the pen to an enemy to run with in the hope he will put an eye out, I don't see any use for this product."
1,False Information in Listing,"Order 2 12-packs of these pens from the Gile company, but I only received 2 pens! I'm sorry, but these pens are not worth ~$10 for 2. I sent an email to Gile Customer Service and am awaiting their response. If it is favorable I will update this comment.*****Update*****Gile Toys has contacted me regarding this complaint and explained that this was an issue with Amazon misrepresenting their product. They made appropriate amends with me regarding this order."
5,Larousse Encyclopedia of Ancient & Medieval History,"I received the book in a timely fashion. It was well-wrapped and arrived in excellent shape. The book, listed used as being Like New, was correct. I am looking forward to reading it. It is the precursor to the next volume in the series: Larousse Encyclopedia of the Modern World, which I just finished--an outstanding volume of world history, scrupulously researched, and punctuated throughout with an exceptional array of photographs, lithographs, charts, and drawings from the period. This volume adds to my collection and should be just as rewarding to read as its subsequent volume. And I should add: the price was right--very reasonable for such a large, pictorial, coffee table-sized book."
3,Misleading title and/or picture,"I believe, there is a mistake either in the headline ""Eau de Parfum"" or on the product shown as ""Eau de Toilette"" - there is a difference between the two and the Seller should know it.""Eau de Parfum"" is stronger and more expensive than ""Eau de Toilette"", so maybe the Seller would care to correct either the headline or the picture of the product. His price though is attractive."
1,Evaporate in 5 minutes,"I purchased this for my girlfriend, it was embarrassing when we found out that evaporates in 5 minutes. Not sure if something happen in mail since the pack had signs of leakage. It was absolute waste of money for me."
3,Chanel,"While the product itself is fine, I suppose, I was very disturbed when I received the package. There was nothing in the product description that stated it was ""unboxed,"" yet when I opened the package, there was a small bit of packaging around the top and top of the sides. There was clear tape/packing around the rest. It was not in a whole box! I specifically chose this one because it DID not say that it was ""unboxed."" This makes me wonder if it is indeed a ""true"" Chanel product. Since this was a gift for my daughter, I was not happy at all with the packaging. And, as I say, I hope that the product was real Chanel. I suppose that remains to be seen."
5,Made a great gift!,I purchased this item as a Valentine's Day present for my brother and am so glad I did. We had just watched the VHS copy we have of the first Inspector Gadget movie and was once again reminded how much better DVD is than VHS. I decided to order it for my brother for Valentine's Day and was very excited to see that I could get both movies for such a reasonable price. My brother has watched both of them and loves them. The quality is great and it arrived on time and in good shape. Very satisfied!
1,Never fry a weisswurst,If the advertised sausage is indeed a weisswurst then you should not fry it but heat (not cook) it in water and eat it (without its skin) with a sweet Bavarian mustard. Frying a weisswurst is as close to perversion as you can get.
2,Disappointed!,"As an avid Earthquake fan, this CD was a disappointment. The CD was flawed and prevented full audio and viewing."
4,Funny,I thought this DVD was really funny esspecially watching it here in Afghanistan. I really though Don D.C. Curry was very funny along with Earthquake himself.
3,to much talking and not enough funny,they did way to much talking and they didnt give the guess comedians that much time to work.
2,Poor Sound and Playing,"Only the first 4 tracks from May 8 have fairly good sound. But the first is ruined by the French announcer. And then on Ladybird Miles inadvertanly starts playing Half Nelson for a few bars before correcting himself. The out choures is all Lady Bird. The sound drops way down for track 5 and never comes back.Save your money. If you dig Tadd and are musically inclined, download - The Dream Is You - from jazzleadsheets It's the only place you will find it. And was it played only once, Milt Jackson BIG BAND BAGS"
3,"Fair, but needs work","This text is not for the practicing OPracle person, and it reads like a College textbook.The examples are clear, but the text is somewhat terse and non-illustrative. It might be a fine book for a High School class, but ois wanting for the working Oracle person."
1,Great book,"While I have a ways to go to really get into this book, so far I'm really impressed. It seems to be written with Forms 9i in mind, but has plenty of comments for those who are still using 6i. So it's good if you're learning both environments. It also comes with the Oracle 9i Forms CDs, which impressed me (even though you can download it free online. Still, it's a huge file!). It says it will also help you prepare for the OCP Forms exam, but the objectives weren't out when the book was finished. So they said they'd put on their web site what part of their book matches the Oracle Forms exam objective, but unfortunately they have not done this. But since there's nothing else out there really for Forms 9i, this is the best book on the market for learning forms and preparing for the OCP forms exam."
3,David Byron - 'Man Of Yesterday: The Anthology' (Repertoire) 3 1/2 stars,"Not a bad 2-CD compilation of David Byron's work, but I thought this 30 track collection definitely could have been a bit better. How? You ask - well, just a suggestion but Castle should've maybe considered putting more Uriah Heep material on this release. Especially some of those 'lesser-known' album cuts like ""Come Away Melinda"", ""Bird Of Prey"", the kick-*ss ""July Morning"", one of my personal favorites ""Love Machine"", ""Circle Of Hands"" or perhaps ""Rainbow Demon"". Don't get me wrong, the music here isn't awful. But I would likely get tiresome of after (I'm guessing) four spins. Gald I borrowed it from a friend."
4,Haunting and exquisite work of embroidery on a theme byOffenbach,"Highly recommended and addictive in its lyricism and tonal perfection, is the 7 and a half minute soliloquy for which track 1 is named - masterfully arranged and superbly played by Werner Thomas-Mifune for Cello with chamber ensemble. The piece is said to honour the memory of Jacqueline du Pre, and his gifted arrangement is exquisitely wreathed around the original oevre by Offenbach, mysteriously unearthed by Thomas-Mifune in his extracurricular forays to outlying hamlets and music libraries searching for lost pearls and forgotten manuscripts. A wonderful discovery indeed! All other tracks reward the cellophile with virtuosic and richly rendered performances of other romantic composers. This is a glorious CD!Purchased on Amazon, international order delivered within 5 days."
5,essential and mandatory listening for all aural efette snobs,"This album billed as a ""chronological history in reverse"" captures the wondrous and elusive sound that this highly original english band created. For those of you who appreciate arty, obscure and pretentious indie pop music, this is for you. Go find a copy somewheres, used most likely and give it a chance... you don't know what you've been missing. If anyone out there knows where to find a copy of ""crumbling the antiseptic beauty"" on vinyl or what have you, let me know. Bon apetite!"
1,Worst Investment Ever,"I bought this carriage for the light weight - my back suffered greatly while carrying my twins. And I also liked the sleek attractive look to it. Unfortunately, I have just received my carriage back from Peg Perego's repair center for the second time and I only have the stroller for 10 months. The first thing to go was the underneath basket which dragged on the floor until it ripped open. That was only with light weight items -not even a diaper bag. The second part to break was the snack trays that easily flip open and do not stay in lock position - this part broke twice and has been replaced on both services. Thirdly, the cup holder is a complete waste as it does not hold even a can of soda without tipping. However, the most major disappointment was dealing with Peg Perego's Customer Service Department which is comprised of smug condescending employees who do anything but provide customer service.Everyone buys a lemon in life and I hope this is my first and last."
1,I agree with wanted to love this stroller,I am very disappointed that this stroller was so expensive and not worth a penny. I used the stroller 5 times since its purchase (witha three month old and a 2 year old weighing a total of 41 pounds) I found several problems with this stroller after the fourth use.1 - the stroller is hard to steer. The front wheels do not swivel very well at all. I found myself practically puching the stroller with the feeling as though the wheel were lock and they were not.3 - The basket underneath draggs. you cannot store anything other than a coloring book and small bottle bag. anything more than that the basket is on the floor.5 - The sunshades began to warp slightly.Babies r us is giving me a hard time to return the stroller which I find disappointing since I spend plenty of money there. I am hoping to get my money back to purchase the combi (which my girlsfriend has and loves)
1,Worst stroller ever!!!,"This is a great LOOKING stroller, but not a great working stroller. My cup holder broke, the basket underneath has a huge hole in it and you can't put your stuff in it because it drags! The harness straps broke off completely. and the wheels are hard to manuver. Just don't buy it!!!! I hate it!! I have now learned to not be so snobby and get the most expensive stroller I just got a new graco and I love it. It was 120 $$ cheaper!"
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this stroller when it first came out in April of last year. I thought it would be great for my newborn and 2 year old but I had trouble just walking to the park. I found myself jerking forward at every bump on the side walk, the basket dragged on the floor with just a small diaper bag in it, if there wasn't a ramp between the street and sidewalk it was almost immpossible to go up & down a crub and the cup holder didn't last a week. After all of that money it ended up sitting in my trunk then my shed. I barely used it and I was so unhappy I decieded to complain to the store and manufactur they said they do not take back used strollers only repair them. A lesson learned...don't leave the store if you haven't tried it out and if you love long neighborhood walks this is NOT for you."
1,Tough to maneuver in the big city.,"This one feels like a dinosaur trying to negotiate your way through any big city. Every curb - a problem, every crevice - a problem. The shallowness of the sun covers - another problem. Feels like the brakes are on with ANY weight in it. 2 toddlers? Forget it! Turning ease? - if youre a bodybuilder maybe. Another crappy stroller with one good feature - snack trays. Oh but one thing about the snack trays - they don't unlatch on one side and swing over like on the single Peg Peregos. So you can't place a child straight in, you always have to lift them up and over and stick their legs thru like your putting them on a child swing - and when you pull them out their shoes are stuck and their legs are stuck. That is unless you completely remove the tray every time you use it and screw that. In conclusion, lousy stroller."
3,Power Cord,"Cord works perfect for what I needed. Kinda wimpy 3 x 18 gauge wire, guess all it needs though."
4,Quick but entertaining!,In true Lodoss War fashion this story is compelling and a great read. This is the first volume that starts it all off and is what the 27 episode tv series was based on. It picks up about 5 years or so after the Grey Witch series but is not entirely connected. A few characters have changed a bit and have no relationship with each other even if they previously did. If you know this going in then the read is fine because the author is technically writting two seperate stories. The plot line is also failry similar but new characters get involved.
2,"Lovely pictures, vapid prose","I found this coffee-table-type volume to be chock-full of nice photographs, but disappointingly short on anything more than sketchy, wide-eyed text - e.g., ""One may use 'remarkable,' 'exceptional,' or some other adjective to describe the Vincent Rapide Series C, and never be far from the truth."" Uh-huh. The authors' priorities also seem skewed toward the trendy rather than the truly historical - e.g., a '73 Honda Trail 90 gets a full page photo, while the '55 Triumph Tiger 110 merits just a 2x3 shot of a strangely half-skirted rear wheel. (And where's the '37 Speed Twin?) In my opinion, Hugo Wilson's ""Encyclopedia of the Motorcycle"" and the Guggenheim Museum exhibit catalog book (""The Art of the Motorcycle"") are better values."
3,It's one to consider.,"A charming book in it's own right, and certainly has a wonderful plot and storyline. The language does tend to get overdescriptive at times, and is a little slow-paced, but apart from that, it's worth a look."
5,Top book in its field,I read this book many years ago and this must be a reissue of what is sureley a classic in men's studies and developmental psychology. The book is well written and recommended for the general population and psychotherapist working with men. Women trying to understand what puzzles them about men will find some poignant answers and therapists can learn what is below the veneer of hidden lives.
1,A worry before buying / reading this book / title.,"I am now thinking about buying this title. I've read the opinion of the reader that backs it, but .... I am almost sure (due to many previous experiences) that the only shortcoming is not just about women, it for sure has been very probably written taking into account (hope I'm wrong) that north-americans are the only people living in this planet. So, if you are looking for readings that help you to succesfully deal with another and/or different type of society, or another type of country, opinions are so deeply oriented to northamerican way of handling life, they are not worthwhile and hardly applicable."
3,Memory Lane,"It all rings true. I was in Alpha 2/8 from April 69 to Sept 69. I humped the same area, and remember all the LZ names from Caroyln to Ike. It was strange to read a memoir from this time. Our actions in the bush were insignificant, and never mentioned in any history book. I imagine Taylor Wise simply wanted someone to know. I can still remember laying in the jungle and listening to the assault on LZ Becky, I was 5 clicks away, and wondered that night if Bravo company would be able to defend that fragile little fire base. And sadly, the only emotion I felt was one of relief, that it was Bravo company, not me. This is not great literature, just an old Cav grunt, getting his demons down on paper. Like his tour in Nam, Wise does his best. If you were Air Cav in 1969, this will open the old wounds and leave you once more, bitter and empty."
5,Honest and Poignant,"I am only halfway through this book but feel compelled to review it for those who are uncertain whether they should read it or not. Tayloe Wise has done us all a favor by giving us a brutally honest account of what the Vietnam war was really like for a combat soldier. War movies have left me numb and still unclear on what the day to days were really like. Perhaps it is Wise's accessible writing style, breath-taking detailed accounts, and refreshing honesty: Eleven Bravo has opened my eyes and made me rethink my assumptions on war, and given me a taste of the realities of the Vietnam war. I feel honored and privileged to be reading Tayloe Wise's memoir and even more so to know him. Good work, Professor."
2,Nice little unit,This is a re-do of my first review.Tried to increase to 4 stars but they will not let me.Orginally when first purchased I was unable able to down load music to the unit. Windows media player 10 would not recognize the unit.The RCA website and windows media player 10 web site were no help. Made for an expensive FM only radio.All is good now that I upgraded to Windows Media player 11.FM radio is good though battery life is short on radio mode.Sound quality is good.
4,A Great Sampling,This is the record that sold me on PDP. When I lived in Chicago PDP was absolutely huge there. I couldn't help but fall under their spell. This set shows the various sides to the band. The second CD just burns throughout. It lifts your spirits and makes you want to dance and sing along...
5,I absolutely love it!,"As my title says, I love it so much! The comic strips are reasonabaly funny! Except for one thing...it's about school, right? They never actually show the characters IN school...all they show is maybe Sally and Charlie Brown at home talking about teachers, grades, tests, uh huh or maybe Linus and Charlie Brown walking to school together. Otherwise, it's a great collection!"
1,Tears,"When I received this item, I found that it had the right cover, but contained a completely different book. I was not happy with the exchange procedure proposed."
5,Best Bag There Is`,"I have had the Stealth reporter D400 AW for about a year. Extremely well made and needed another bag. I find the 550 as well made and useful as to 400. This bag easily handels a Canon 100-400 'L' series, 70-200mm 'L' series plus a number of other lenses and a 40D with battery pack.This is a very rugged equipment bag. It's not a bag to load and carry around all day however. Oh the bags great. But once loaded with quality gear.... it's HEAVY.For just smaller lenses and camera body, I'd recommend the Lowepro Slingshot. Very handy and easily carries stuff for a day trip. But the Slingshot won't easily carry the larger 'L' series lenses.The Stealth Reporter line is highly reommended for Pro's and semi-pros for getting equipment to and from a shoot."
2,Meh.,"Very dated. 1994 was a loooong time ago. There are some good tips on how to make work around the house easier. If you are looking for a true ""how to"" book full of things you'll deal with while owning a house...this isn't it."
3,Helpful but old,The book had some good tips but it's an older book so it doesn't have any tips for newer kinds of handy work done in our homes today.
5,Fun,"I'm not going to say much about Exodus,every thrasher knows Exodus.Fabulous Disaster is one of the greatest thrash albums.Exodus has a fun sound to them.They cover Low Rider and they do an awesome job.Steve Souza has an original voice.A lot of people talk about the song The Toxic Waltz being so cheesy,who cares that song rules and the lyrics rule.Every song is amazing on this album."
5,FABULOUS THRASH ATTACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"FABULOUS DISASTER is one of the best albuns from the legendary THRASH METAL band EXODUS!!!!!! All the songs are great and the band shine high at their pinnacle!!!!!! The golden years of EXODUS are great THRASH stuff!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED, as their other masterpieces PLEASURES OF THE FLESH, IMPACT IS IMMINENT and FORCE OF HABIT!!!!!! EXODUS STRIKES AGAIN!!!!!!"
3,Decent but somethings missing,"After I had pillaged the catalog of the big four I shot my attention towards bands like Overkill, Exodus, Testament and many of the other fairly well known supporting bands, and this was the first thrash album I got that wasn't a big four album. I give this three stars but have to insist that 3.5 would be a more accurate representation of it's score. ""Like Father, Like Son"" is hands down the best Exodus song, any album. The title track is a real killer too. Then on the same album were tortured by such horrible filler as ""Low Rider?!?!?!"" what?!?!?! Whose idea was that one? I guess ""Overdose"" makes more sense since Steve does really sound like Bon, but even this one leaves me scratching my head. Then stuff like ""Toxic Waltz"" try to inspire some sort of intensity but come off laughable. ""Cajun Hell"" is another flaccid track. ""Bonded By Blood"" is better, and unfortunately this is one of their last ones worth getting your hands on, despite its flaws."
5,One of the best metal albums ever.,"If you like metal at all and thrash in particular, this is a MUST HEAR.I recommend finding an original pressing though, as this remaster is mastered too loudand tends to induce ear-fatigue really quickly, like, within a few songs."
4,Thrash at it's finest.,"This album rocks, plain and simple. Whilst bands such as Metallica and Megadeth were receiving more mainstream attention, the boys in Exodus were churning out brutal riffs and wailing solos whilst dealing with such diverse issues such as prison riots, mad despots with their fingers poised over ""launch"" buttons, government corruption, cheating lowlifes and the joys of moshing. As far as I'm concerned, the guitar playing of Rick Hunolt and Gary Holt kicks the collective asses of Hammett, Hanneman and King and the drummer sounds like canned thunder. My personal favourite is ""Cajun Hell"". My head starts to bang involuntarily when that HUGE riff kicks in. I can't recommend this record enough. If you like your metal fast, furious, precise and socially aware, you'll love this. Buy it."
4,REAL METAL!!!!!!!!!!!,"There was once upon a time when heavy metal bands actually knew how to play their instruments unlike bands of today like Slipknot, Mudvayne, and KoRn. Even Metallica can't write a guitar solo for their songs anymore. Back in the late 1980's the ""good"" heavy metal scene was coming to a sad end, but not before Exodus released their monster thrash album ""Fabulous Disaster."" This album is thrash to the core and everything that heavy metal is suposed to be."
4,Another Great,"This is another great album in Exodus' history...of course, they are all pretty good. This cd contains classics like Toxic Waltz and Low Rider. The production could be better, but nonetheless, this is a great cd from start to finish."
4,A bleak and all-too possible vision of the future,"I'm sorry to see this novel is out of print, it was very good. One might mention that Before she wrote this novel, Mary Rosenblum wrote several short stories about ""The Drylands"".The thing that makes this novel stand out is that it's much more realistic and low-key than most science fiction novels, and the near future it portrays is all too beliavable. The only actual fantastical element comes from the inclusion of ""mutants"" with special talents that have begun to develop as a result of living in The Drylands.This realistic and grim-and-gritty aspect also makes ""The Drylands"" quite different from Rosenblum's next novel ""Chimera"", which was also very good, but very different."
4,Cute bear,"Would have loved it without the advertising. It's a cute toy for a little one, and know he'll love it."
4,Food lovers will love this!,"I got this for my husband becuase he loves food. Not foo-foo, ritzy food, but greasy, fried, meaty food! We don't have cable so we'd never even seen an episode, but I'd heard about it from friends and gave it a try. Although I'm sure some people would just cringe at the serving sizes and amounts of butter/grease on display here, we think it's very entertaining! And my husband always says that watching this show makes him hungry. This was a good buy for never seeing it before and now I think it's time for a road trip to find some of the ""treasures"" we've seen on here!"
1,tudors final season,"This was the fourth time I have ordered this DVD set from Amazon, and all 4 had flaws. Episodes 2,3, and 8 on all four DVDs had skipping issues and were unwatchable. Amazon said they would take this DVD off the shelves until the problem was corrected, but the last issue I got still had the same problems."
2,Overlook of Henry V!!!,"I was very disappointed with this mini series. No one in the movie remotely resembled the person they were supposed to be portraying. The historical facts were in part very wrong. Not onlt onle did Henry send the wrong princess to the wrong country to marry the ancient king, but all the men seemed to look alike.His sister Mary Rose was sent to France to marry the ancient King Louie. Margaret married the King of Scotland. When make an epic of this dimention they should at least try to get their facts straight.The series stopped before the reins of Edward, Mary and Elizabeth."
1,Disappointing Tudor Finale,"I purchased this final season of The Tudors for my husband's birthday, as he and I just loved the first seasons. This collection was very disappointing as the acting was not nearly as good as the previous seasons. The ending was done well, however, by the director. Jonathon Rhys Meyers and Henry Cavill were excellent in their roles once again, but the others, not so much."
3,The series is awesome but...,this is the second time we have watched this series. It is awesome but the video qiality was not great. On every episode there was a spot we had to stop the video and resume because it either froze or skipped forward.
5,the last of the tudors series,"this item arrived on time and in the promised condition. enjoyed watching it, even though season one and two are the best from the series."
2,So so....subtitles are missing,"The quality of the product is good, but subtitles are not available: this was not shown anywhere in the website."
3,Sad to see it over...,"I was actually hoping that they would take it a little further and go into Mary and Elizabeth a bit, but not too be. The first season was the best, the second was good, the third was eh,a nd the fourth was moderately redeeming. Enjoy"
3,The Final Saga,"The final season is not as good as season one and two. They were the best. And then season 3 starts to drag, and then season 4 is filled with nothing but torture and even more sickening acts of torture. Anyway, it's good to see how they decided to wrap up the series. Even though we know the historic account of Henry and what happens to him, it was great to see how it was played out theatrically. The final episode was done in good taste and gave justice to the series."
4,"Awesome show, and left wanting more","I loved this show and will watch many times over. The show is not however historically accurate. I've read several books that state the true nature and events that occured during the reign of King Henry finding numerous inaccuracies a page long if written down. That being said, the acting, writing and overall entertainment was nothing less than awesome. Do yourself a favor, and give this show 2-3 episodes and if your not hooked, then go back to your re-runs of The Brady Bunch."
5,Great drama and not bad history,"While timelines are condensed, some characters composites of historical figures, details changed, and the sequence of events not always accurate, I must say that I was still impressed by the more-or-less faithful treatment of this time period. From what I can tell, the changes that were made were for dramatic effect and shouldn't be distracting to any but the most committed pedants. A typical example this season was the treatment of Thomas Culpeper. The series omitted the fact that he was knighted and should have been referred to as a Sir. It also has him kill the park-keeper, whose wife he rapped, instead of a villager in an unrelated incident. But the overall fate of Culpeper and the reason for that fate are true to history.This season brings alive many figures long dead in a vibrant, believable and engaging way. Highly recommended for history buffs and drama addicts alive."
5,Just as good as the others!,"This is a well written, well acted and well directed series. If you haven't watched any of it, you have missed out on a truly exceptional, historical-based production. This last season is every bit as finely tuned as the others. Enjoy!"
4,A Tragic King,"It is hard to imagine how the conflicts of state and personal relationships impact on a King convinced of his devine right to rule.We are similarly conflicted in our feelings toward himThis is the tragedy of King Henry who remains for all the grandeur of his court, a lonely figure.We admire his courage and intelligence and dispair at his vanity and cruelty.This series gives an insight into a world we can hardly imagine."
1,Not worth the plastic to wrap it,"Pathetic and innauthentic, with a lot of gratuitous sex thrown in to keep brain-dead females interested. But that seems to be Showtime's ""magic"" forumla for American audiences. If it wasn't Showtime's baby, I'd be insulted."
1,dissapointed,"I ordered this from you and the first two discs played fine with the third disc not playing at all. Appeared to have nothing on it and the tv said ""check disc"" and ""disc problem"". So I sent it back and asked for a replacement as I wanted this fourth season as I had seasons 1-3. You sent me another set and it had the very same problem. I sent it back and asked for my money back. I had to pay the postage and had a lot of trouble getting you to return my money to my Discover card and as of today you still haven't and I will never order anything from you again."
1,Insulting,"It's one thing to take liberties with historic fact to enhance entertainment value. It's an entirely different proposition to invent history so that it results in mediocre dribble. For anyone even remotely familiar with even a couple pages of this era's history, Tudors manages to waste time while insulting the intelligence. My only issue in reviewing this is that there is no option for zero stars."
3,The Tutors,"I was truely wanting to see the series because of the history. Instead, we were presented with an unclad JRM in many sceens with his partner of the mnoment. I kept expecting to see him prancing through in spike heels and a black boa. Surely there other actors with more integrity and depth to portray Henry in a more realistic manner?V."
1,Pathetic,"Sorry but this drama soap opera is aimed mainly at an American viewer who have absolutely no knowledge of English and european history. To choose a top model as Henry VIII is pathetic - the king was a baloon with an ulcerated leg (which smelled as roten meat!). More, Henry is portrayed as the most powerful king in Europe. That is not true. Charles I of Spain (Emperor Charles V of the Holy Empire), the king of France, the king of Portugal, the Italian princes, even the kings of central Europe were more important. England transforms itself in a European and world power with Elizabeth I his daughter from Ann Boleyn."
1,"History , or Destruction of history","I am a history buff, i love to read, watch most anything todo with history.The reviews that were given on the Tudors, gave me enough insight to step back and think. Do i want to spend the amount of money for all 4 seasons of the Tudors, from what the reviewers have stated the history of this series is not up to par. No matter what, you can not change history. Even in fiction series. So i have chosen not to buy all four seasons cause, i would not be able to enjoy the series. Sorry but the history we know of the Tudors is not boring, nor is it lame. Had the creators of this series stuck with the true historys of the Tudors i would be more then happy to purchase this Series. Maybe Hollywood and Cable will think about adding fiction too the historys next time. Once again thank you to the reviewers for helping me with my choice. With out you i would have waisted a bit of cash and wished i would not have purchased. So i am greatful to everyone of you."
5,I fell in love...,"I fell in love with this film because of Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Indeed, the film really showed royalty. The entire actors were brilliant. I can watch this over and over again. Love it!Elvis: The Mini-Series"
3,Just OK.,Season 4 seemed to run out of steam unlike the prior seasons that had me coming back for more into the wee hours of the morning.
3,History besmirched by dalliance in mediocrity,"History is besmirched by dalliance in mediocrity by the producers, most cynics will agree. Obviously, the juvenile queen has got to be the focus of all attention from episode to episode until she is caught. Even then, the ""boy"" who seduces her leaves a bad taste as do some other characters. There is a scene of rape with no conclusion. This entire series is probably the last of its kind. The BBC version of Henry VIII is still the best one to watch."
5,Wonderful historical drama,"Very well done and intriguing account of King Henry's life. If you like King of Thrones, you'll like this too."
2,4 Episodes per DVD = Low Resolution,"This review pertains only to the DVD version, which I purchased thinking my DVD player up-converts to 1080p so it should look almost as good as a Blu-Ray. Wrong! In Season 1, it was not usual to see only 1 episode per disk, sometimes 2, or perhap 3. By Season 2 there were 2 or 3 episodes per disk. Now in its last season we are seeing 4 episodes per disk, 4! The result of which is low quality resolution, so that even on a 32"" screen the images are noticably pixelated. It's barely tolerable on a 32"" screen. If you have a small TV, or don't have 1080p quality, or are on a shoe-strong budget, then by all means buy the DVD version. But if you've come to expect quality and can spend a penny, get Blu-Ray!"
3,An incomplete saga,"The biggest mistake in this fitful series is the name. It isn't The Tudors, it is Henry the 8th. Most of the other Tudors, such as Henry the 7th, Mary, Edward the 4th, and Elizabeth the 1st (the best Tudor of the lot), are footnotes, or seen only as children. The consumer affairs organisations that make sure our goods are labelled correctly should have been onto this like a shot. Like most historical series, The Tudors comes with so many errors of fact that to be too worried about it could reduce one's enjoyment of this bloody romp. So much time is spent with Henry in bed with various women that the story begins to drag. However, it remains an interesting version of the life and times of Henry the 8th, but certainly not the Tudors; unless the producers have more in store they are not telling us about"
3,no captions,Back cover says CC but there are no captions. I have difficulty with British accents. Misleading and hard for me to understand
1,Not good reception,"Unfortunately, it froze after a half hour and I was not able to finish the episode. I will never do this again."
4,History Revised,"Excellent production but a little weak on historical facts. Henry V111 had two daughters, Mary and Margaret. Mary married the King of France, Louis X11, and Charles Brandon and Margaret married James 1V of Scotland. In this production both sisters are merged into one new Mary who is shown to have married the King of Portugal. Also Henry seems to have shed a few pounds compared to his actual portraits. Despite this the film was well worth watching and more entertaining than most history classics."
5,tudors,I love this show. The movie came quickly in the mail. Literally two days after I ordered it off of amazon. The only problem i had was that the second disc kept stalling. I bought it new so not really sure why it was doing that. I cleaned it and it works just fine.
3,"Good, but not the best Henry8 series available","One of my favorite, all time BBC drama series was the 6 Wives of Henry VIII (1970). Its right up there with I, Claudius and Upstairs/Downstairs. Back then they could not depend on nudity and graphic sex scenes to hold the audience so creators had to make due with historical accuracy, phenominal acting, and characters that could have stepped out of Hans Holbein portraiture. (As one who has the studied the clothing of this period, I'll throw one more criticism at the Tudors...many of the costume details are more representative of the Elizabethan period than that of her father)The Tudors series may indeed be sexy and well produced entertainment, but if you want historical accuracy (especially if you have children who need to learn about the period)go back to 6 Wives...Amazon has it on DVD."
4,"tudors is addictive, jonathan reys meyers is yummie","Although the first two seasons of the tudors were the best, one must see the entire series. I could not stop myself from watching the set almost back to back. How can you beat getting an accurate history lesson disguised as entertainment, dripping with drama, murder, intrigue, sex, and Jonathan Ryes Meyers. He is so sexy as Henry VIII, you want to eat him. Of course this is totally chick-flick material, watch this with your best friend or your mom, but don't torture your boyfriend with it."
3,Black Forest Clock 71B,"Made with typical german precision, this clock functions perfectly. My sole problem is with the discription which is confusing as to the duration of the clock's drive mechanism. THIS IS A ONE DAY CLOCK...meaning you will have to readjust the weights on a daily basis. That said, the clock runs fine and is pleasing to the eye and the ear."
2,71B Kassel Black Forest Cuckoo Clock,The clock is very nice and works well but it came with issues at the door of the birth and with the mechanism so I had to go with a technician to fix that costed me around US$50.....Not good !!!!.....After that the clock works very well....I had to comment that this kind of clocks are not precise that is normalThe cost and time to return it to USA as warranty dot make sense so I decided to fix it here in Mexico
4,cute clock,"the clock arrived ahead of schedule, was good quality and my granddaughter loved it the only problem was one of the chains that wind it came out but the company has promised to replace it, waiting for them to sent the replacement"
5,prrrrrrrrrreciousssssssss!,"This is a great set of miniatures for kids who are fans of LotR. For the young collector its a great starter set from this series, for the other kids its well contained in itself. With the discontinuing of this line keeping a few of these MIB is a very good investment idea. Grab 'em."
1,Lord Of The Money Thieves,My son's action figure fell apart after 2 days. He did not play rough with it or drop it or anything. I resent this toy.
3,"Expensive, but detailed","My son recently became interested in the Lord of Rings books and movies, so I searched on-line for action figures. They are rare, even a few years after the movies came out. This set of the 9 fellowship members fit the bill for us. It contained all of his favorite characters. They are pretty small, but ironically, they are the same size as his toy army guys, so he plays with this set along with the army toys and props, and has pretend battles at Helms Deep, etc! They were more expensive than I would normally have paid, but he loves them. They are very detailed, and from what I can tell so far, fairly durable."
1,The ink is very light,The pens are not at all balanced and the ink is very light. The pen feel very cheap. I expected a much better coming from the Pilot brand and the amount it cost
4,from myth to romantic love,the different way to live Love from differents culture specially the Western one.Very interesting poin of view
4,fun read,"The history of romance is well documented in this book. It's more of a ""pop"" psychology book, but it is definitely a fun, light, interesting read."
3,Didn't work for my Cat,"After using this product for a week as directed, there was absolutely no change in my cat's behavior. I guess it doesn't work for all cats."
2,Ineffective valve screw,"The valve screw does not allow the air release to be controlled effectively. In fact it is difficult to prevent the air escaping no matter how tightly the valve is ""closed"""
5,"Omron Blood Pressure Monitor, Large","Good quality and built to last. Dial is easy to read and can be easily removed and set on the table for a better viewing angle when taking your own readings, if necessary. I was getting high readings with a regular size monitor on my 15 yr old son, but with the large cuff they were much more accurate. I would recommend this product to anyone needing to take regular and reliable blood pressure readings."
3,Worked well while it lasted...,I received this blood pressure cuff as a Christmas present in preparation for my nursing school clinicals. I began using the cuff in February - one day a week on no more than 2 patients in a brief time frame. During the last 2 weeks of my 4 months of clinicals I noticed the needle was not calibrated to 0 mmHg. The result is inaccurate blood pressure readings. I was not able to reset the cuff's needle and ultimately used another cuff. I am planning to purchase a new cuff for clinicals beginning in September. I was very satisfied with this cuff... for the brief time it worked properly.
4,For the price it's a good deal.,"I work in the medical field as an EMT and I wanted to buy an adult ""large"" cuff to monitor my dad's blood pressure. I found this Item and I purchased this because it has a ""lifetime warranty"" on the calibration. So far it works fine but this item does not come assembled, and there are no instructions on how to assemble it....not even on the Omron website. Luckily I already own an adult BP cuff made by ""ADC"" which came assembled, so I simply assembled the Omron BP cuff by looking at that one. This may be a problem for people who don't know how to assemble it and don't have another cuff to look at. The Omron cuff does have a size measure system just like the ""ADC"" cuff, and even has a marker for the artery placement although the ADC cuff has an even better artery marker. Overall, I like this product and it works fine, but if i had to choose again, I'd totally go with an ""ADC"" cuff because they look nicer and feel more well made than the Omron."
1,junk piece of med apparatus.,"i have been purchasing omron prods with no problem,unti i got this junk.just after few days of usage,it wouldnt calibrate anymore.will have to contact omron c.s."
2,A little disappointed,"I purchased this item because Omron products have always been good to me in the past. I received this, and the guage cover fell off after about a week. The ring that secures the glass cover to the guage was stripped and would not stay on. The whole face falls out if the ring is not intact, rendering this useless. Will choose anothr brand next time."
4,Great quality!!,"I love this product however the bulb continues to fall off before and after use on a patient, I can never get it to stay on... Other than that I love it!"
2,"Omron Sphygmomanometer, Black, Adult","This is a very good quality unit. However, I ended up returning it, as it does not have a ""D"" ring attached to the cuff so it was impossible to get it on my arm by myself. Even my husband had difficulty getting it on my arm, because of the slippery nylon material. I'm sure it was accurate, since it was a manual cuff, but I never could get it tight enough on my arm to be satisfied with the unit. While the quality of the LifeSource UA-100 Home Aneroid Blood Pressure Monitor is not as good as this Omron, I still ended up buying 3 LifeSource UA-100's. One for each us, as we all monitor. Plus the UA-100 is cheaper than Omron and includes the stethoscope. You have to purchase a separate stethoscope for the Omron, making it more cumbersome to use for one person."
2,"Worked for two years with very little use, and then died.",The cuff worked for two years and then died (the guage no longer works). Am sending it in to tech support who were extremely unhelpful.
3,Product ok; marketing lousy,"Two major complaints:1. The Amazon ad for the sphygmomanometer in no place gives the actual size in inches of the cuff. I took the word ""large"" at its face value (to me); the ad should probably have read ""giant.""2. Amazon's return policy says the item has to be returned ""unopened."" How stupid it that!Needless to say, I won't be buying anything more on Amazon if I am not completely, positively, fully, infallibly sure that I won't be returning it.Amazon, get real!T. MCDONNELL"
4,Not what I expected,"I thought that this was a self-contained unit to measure one's own blood pressure. Altho it was not misrepresented, unfortunately I did not realize that it needed a stethoscope (not included). I returned it.It is not configured so that you can put it on your own arm very easily. However, for its intended use it appears to be of high quality and very solidly built."
2,Omron Sphygmomanometer,I returned it because it did not work for me! It came with absolutely NO instructions and I had to call professionals in order to find out that I would need a Stethiscope in order to use it. I cannot honestly rate in any way! Thank you.
3,Not what I expected,Had to return it back the same day I received it. Is a good quality material but after pumping to check blood pressure it gets stuck on 140. I like omron brand but I'm not sure if I would order again from this manufacturer.
3,not durable,The product arrived unassembled and was easily assembled. The bulb does not stay on without superglu. The face of the dial came scratched but worked accuratly
5,Excellent quality,"This manual blood pressure monitor is one of the best there is on the market and it is an affordable one. Comes with carry case, all perfect to fit in your bag - if you use it as a student or doctor."
2,Tubing quality is poor,"I've probably purchased 3 or 4 Omron sypygs over the years and they perform well enough under normal use. However, I've consistently found the tubing quality poor, limiting the useful life of the product. Essentially, the tubing becomes sticky or cracks after a few years and cannot be replaced, so maybe I'll try another brand next time, or look for one with different attachments. I doubt very much that it's a problem unique to Omron however.And no, I don't live in a jungle, and it isn't constantly exposed to UV light!"
3,It is Ok,It arrived quickly in a vinyl bag versus leather one I had a few years ago. It came off centered from zero and I can't center it accurately so it is not too helpful. Also you need another person to use it on yourself.
3,A general whole house water filter.,"We've been using these filters for years because without them, our water is at times visibly muddy. They do filter well enough for washing dishes, showering, laundry, etc. ; but I still don't trust it for drinking water. Also, once the filter is full of debris it must be changed or it starts dumping dirt into your water. Even the strong smell of chlorine lets you know it's time to change it."
3,Whole House Water Filters,"These water filters work, but for a limitied time, at least in our house. We have 5 people in the house and are doing laundry all the time, so they don't last long. They improve the taste and smell of the water."
5,Great Price & Quality,The filters are very good quality and they fit my hole house filter system.The shipping was extremely fast and i am very pleased with the product.
3,Ordered many,I have used this filter for many years. It is adequate. I will continue to use the item. This year I had a new well and found I needed to change them frequently with all the additional sediment.
3,basic filters,These do a fine jog of filtering our well water. For some reason the price of these have more than doubled in the last five years
5,"A MUST HAVE, METAL CLASSIC","I GOT THIS ALBUM ON CASSETTE WHEN IT 1ST CAME OUT. I LOST IT A FEW YRS. LATER. I FINALLY GOT THE CD AFTER NOT HEARING THIS GEM FOR ALMOST 20 YRS. I FORGOT WHAT A GREAT ALBUM IT IS. I HAVE ALL THEIR CDs, BUT THIS IS, BY FAR, THE BEST. I WISH THEY AND ""UGLY KID JOE"" WOULD BOTH REUNITE, PUT OUT NEW ALBUMS, THEN TOUR TOGETHER. TALK ABOUT A CAN'T MISS TOUR. I KNOW, KEEP DREAMING. IT STILL WOULD BE SWEET."
2,Scatterbrain/Scale Mastery,"This album has an amazing ability to transport you back to the days when ""Banging your head"" was Hype. These guys really knew how to mix the popular styles of comedy with fast pumping, bass thumping, crowd jumping metal music and throw in just enough Motzart to to make you wonder if scales were ever ment to be played at ""Break neck"" speed. This album is by far one the best of the 90's music. Though not one of the most popular, this one showed off the genius guitar and bass licks that people are still working on 13 years later."
5,Perfect!,"For years I have been suffering from drugstore tweezers which have torn up my face. Thanks to the reviews here, I tried these, and couldn't be happier. I like to be able to be rid of hairs as soon as I can see or feel them, and these do the trick, without the gouge.Since the tweezers come with a rubber cap which fits tightly over the edges, there's no need to worry about damage - just protect them as soon as you're done using them!"
2,rubis swiss tweeze tweezers,"I have purchased this product many times at the mall and had always been very impressed, but this time doesn't seem to be the case. The tweezers aren't as sharp as I am accustomed to. I would return them, but don't want to take the time. Will probably have to go back to the mall. Pretty disappointed."
4,Best tweezers ever for me - but wish they'd stay sharp longer,"I originally bought these for about $50 in a beauty supply shop after using Tweezerman - and getting them resharpened (which really wasn't worth it). They lasted a long time. But eventually they dulled and unlike Tweezerman there is no sharpening service. I bought a second, and third, pair from Amazon and saved money. They are still my recommended tweezer, but they don't seem to hold that ultra sharp edge allowing you to get at new or tiny hairs as well as they used to when new. And yes, absolutely don't drop them because they are alinged so precisely it is easy to knock them out of alignment if dropped on the tip. I use towels around me. Just in case."
2,Not so good...,The very end of the tip is very precision. The leading edge of the slat tip was not precision at all. The hair would just slip through any part of the tweezers except the very tip. I returned them... Perhaps I just received a dysfunctional pair?
2,Just one concept repeated,"To me the book seems to have only one concept, which may be a valuable concept, which is repeated over and over again. Not really much content. I thought the whole thing could be written in a few pages."
1,A classic golf instruction book,"Ernest Jones was a famous instructor whose most famous theory was Swing the Clubhead. There have been many pictures over the years of Jones swinging a penknife attached to a handkerchief, sometimes alone, sometimes while griping a golf club.But reading the book was a bit of a disappointment. Its a very quick read and it seems full of Jones' explaining why swinging the clubhead is so important. But outside of the familary drawings of him swinging the penknife there isn't much instruction on how to swing the clubhead. Or how to get this feeling of swinging."
2,Good for younger people,"I read this book after reading the one published by Golf Digest, since another reader said it was the original work. However, I didn't see that this book was that much different. I do like the notion of a pendulum swing and its simplicity in instruction. However, it is my opinion that golfers today need to have other thoughts as well, such as a firm rear leg against which to turn. When you incorporate the pendulum with other contemporary advice, I think it helps you to extend your arms more for a fuller swing arc. But don't rely on this book alone if you want to advance beyond beginning golf. Look at Humphries' book ""Two Steps to a Perfect Swing"" if you still want to keep it simple but want to improve."
1,THIS IS NOT THE BOOK - SWING THE CLUBHEAD,"The book depicted in this website clearly is not what is being shipped. The book being shipped is titled ""Swing the Clubhead Method"" and is a completely different book than Ernest Jones' Swing the Clubhead. It is a copy of Jones' first book ""Swinging into Golf"". It is still a good book, but not what is being advertised."
2,Not bad,"I have read a lot of golf books. Usually, I can pick up a tip or two. This did not really offer too much. If you are a hack like me, then I would buy ""Break 100 Now: From Hacker to Golfer in Just 90 Days"" by Mike Adams way before this book."
1,"Buy a Belkin, Go Insane","The power and sleep buttons are the same size and height regular keys which make them easy to bump when using navigation keys or number pad. Almost all Belkin keyboards are like this. I'd bump them even when reaching for something on my desk and I'd lose hours of stupidly unsaved work. Waiting for your computer to start up again isn't fun either. Other times I'd bump the sleep button, which was less disastrous, but just as infuriating. Adding insult to injury, the power button would not turn the computer back on or wake it. I finally ended up taking a hammer to it. Funny, now that it's in a thousand peices, it still works as well as when I first got it."
3,PS2?,I bought this keyboard assuming it was made in the last few years. Apparently only if you have Windows 98 and a PS2 connection. I didn't know they still made PS2 keyboards! Had to spend an additional $5 on an adapter.
5,The Standard Work on the Holocaust,"After nearly half a century, Hilberg's monumental work continues to be the standard work in the field. Hilberg's research methods, his attention to context, and his literary genius continues to inspire new generations of historians. The first college lecture I ever gave--on the Holocaust--was based on this book in conjunction with Arendt's ""Banality of Evil."" Of course, you must read ""Destruction"" in tandem with Hilberg's heart-wrenching memoir ""Politics of Memory"" to grasp fully the triumphs and tragedies of the greatest Holocaust historian."
2,Not bad but not worth the money.,"I like the exterior and color but its construction is cheap, if sold for half the price, it would be ok, but definitely not worth $60 + shipping I paid for it. I'm returning it and will try to find something better."
2,Me want know fortune....,"Not much here. You'd be just as well off writing down a list of 20 to 30 possible fortunes and then rolling a dice with as many sides or asking a magic 8-ball your fortune. This book basically saps any of the poetry and ambiguity out of the I-chingand as such treats Taoism as a cheap worthless trinket suitable for resale in the Salvation Army knick-knack department. Why do people insist on trivializing and dumbing down incredibly ancient, complex, and mystical traditions like Taoism and Christianity????????"
2,Too Harsh!,"This lotion gives you a deep dark tan but it also left my skin very blotchy. I am a regular tanner and I have never had this problem before. I normally am a big fan of California Tanning lotions, but this stuff is very harsh."
5,what a lovely book,"i got this for my nephew who found my mother's copy from 1912 and in rough shape. this was bought when my grandparents were kids. my nephew wanted to read it and wanted a better copy to get started with. i had no idea this was so lovely a book. i will be looking for more copies for Christmas, one for each family to have to read their kids, like my grandparents did for my mom and she did for me. the art work in the book is amazing and each story/chapter is well written and it is straight Bible stories with out any political rewritings. it looks like it was in print for some 50 years or so, i saw a paperback one on line, but you would think that an antique book like this would be very expensive, but it wasn't at all, under $20.00."
2,good product,Nice balloon but it doesn't take much to pop it. it served its purpose for me which was for decorating. The kids love it because it is a spongebob balloon.
1,Not worth the Price,"I bought these in spring and was really quite happy with the fit and everything. They worked well.My opinon changed quickly when they didn't even last one gardening season. I had to throw them away in August because they had holes in the fingertips. These are supposed to be GARDENING GLOVES!!! Anyway, for this price they should have lasted much longer to be worth this expense. I would not recomend these gloves if you are doing some real gardening!!!"
5,BEST WORK GLOVES EVER!!!,"THE BIONIC WOMEN'S CLASSIC GARDENING GLOVES ARE PERFECT FOR MORE THAN JUST GARDENING. I AM A PROFESSIONAL EQUINE GROOM AND HAVE TRIED DOZENS OF DIFFERENT WORK GLOVES OVER THE PAST 20+ YEARS. THESE GLOVES ARE BY FAR THE BEST FOR THE FIT, COMFORT & THE CONVENIENCE OF NOT HAVING TO KEEP TAKING THEM ON AND OFF BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN PICK UP A DIME WITH THEM ON. THEY ARE WASHABLE TOO!!!"
1,These Gloves R terrible,"no stars!!!! I bought these bionic gloves and they began to tear at the seams 3 months later. I called the manufacture and the rude representative said that they couldn't do anything about it. Normally I wouldn't make a big deal about this, but since it cost so much i feel as if i never got my money's worth. I got the right size i washed them i did everything i was suppose to. i will never buy anything affiliated with bionic again. Thanks for reading"
4,gardeners plus,"There are a raft of gloves on the market for gardening. My experience made me skeptical of these gloves because they are ""leather"" and once it gets wet and filthy < which, afterall, most dirt is, they get stiff as rocks and while they soften again, they are measurably deteriorated. My sweet partner gave me a pair as a gift so I lucked out. I have worn out two previous pairs and have not thrown away the old pairs though they have no fingers. I simply line those with a thin surgical glove and I use them for doing WOODWORKING. They are a first rate wood workers glove because of the way they are padded and the wrist support is added. THis year I bought my own paitr and another as a gift. They are as good as any gloves you can find for gardening."
3,Beware lot quality,"I work a lot with DVDs, and have observed wide variance in quality, even from the same vendor. I had good luck with Sony when purchased from local stores, but most of the disks in my 100 stack from Amazon exhibit significant popping and stalling, regardless of write speed. Its impossible to say whether Amazon just got a bad lot, or if there was damage during shipping (the stack was rolling around in the box on arrival). My advice is to buy smaller stacks. Bigger stacks are cheaper, but if you get a bad stack, you lose a lot more money."
2,Not the same as they are used to be.,"These disks are no longer the same sony disks that they are used to be. The company that makes these ""daxon"" is no longer producing dvds as of 2010. Most of the current sony disks are now made by ritek and they are known for producing cheap quality optical media. I would advice to check the MID of the dvd before burning. The ones that are made by daxon are labeled as Sony D21 while the one that are made by Ritek are labeled as Ritek F 16-01. So don't be fooled by the brand and the ""made in taiwan"" because you not getting what you thought you are getting.Another way to verify if they are made by daxon or ritek is by looking at the wrapping label on the bottom of the cake box. There should be a serial id starting with the letter D."
1,Absolute crap!,"I typically don't have any problems burning DVD's even using the store brands. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of coasters I've made over the years. These Sony discs have turned out to be absolute crap. I bought a 100 pack spindle and have yet to burn a good one. When I put in one of the other brands I have on hand I can burn the same file without issue so I know it's the discs. Interestingly, my main DVD burner is made by Sony. Go figure. Stay far away from these."
5,99% perfect,"Since I got the Turner Classic Movies bug a little over a year ago, I've recorded about 1200 movies, using about 600 or 700 Sony DVD+R disks. I have an old fashioned conventional DVD recorder and record in the SP (2 hour), LP (4 hour) and EP (6 hour) modes.To date, I've have no more than 3 or 4 bad disks, about 1 out of every 200, and both the sound and the picture quality are identical to the original movies as seen on TCM. I couldn't recommend this product more highly, at least for building up a library of classic movies."
1,shockingly bad quality dvds,"With a Sony Optiarc writer, this spindle has given me 20 coasters vs 17 usable dvds so far. I'm using Nero 7 Ultra and Nero 8 Lite, both write TDK and other brands quite easily. I bought this spindle of 100 locally, and their policy is exchange only, but why would I want more of a bad thing? I'm an MCSA (soon to be MCSE) who's written plenty of spindles of dvds and cds, and this product is by far the worst I've used in the past ten years."
1,Poor quality,I have purchased the 100 pack Sony DVD-Rs and CD-Rs cheap from Costco and most fail to burn properly on my PC. A waste of money. I won't buy them again.The TDK and Memorex brands work fine. Maybe there will be one bad disc in a 100 for those brands.
5,GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!,"I've been using Sony DVD + R 4.7 GB for Years and never had a Problem. Although I never use them in Computers, only with DVD Machines. I have Recorded Tons of them to Transfer Information, Music, Movies from Videos to DVDs and Never Had a Single Glitch. This is the only Blank DVD I Will Use, it makes Great Copies and sometimes I think they are even better than the original. I am so glad I was able to find 100 Discs here at Amazon for just that Price! Thank You"
4,Sony DVD+R Recordable Storage Spindle,i always found sony's blank media (cd's or dvd's)Better as compare to other name brand product.Also amazon service very satisfactory .-----NO COMPLAINTS.ThanxSony DVD+R Recordable Storage Spindle (4.7GB) 100 Disc
2,Best you can get with Ritek,Apparently Sony outsources to Ritek ... so Ritek actually made these dvds.. not Sony. I guess it is hard to find the real Sony dvds anymore. Make sure you check all your media id's to determine what you have really paid for.
2,Spotty Quality,"I've purchased three of these spindles. One was consistently good quality. Two have burned flawed discs (or couldn't burn at all) at the rate of about one bad to two good discs. The flaws tend to be toward the end of the disc, so I have to check each disc carefully. I won't be buying Sony discs anymore. I've switched to Verbatim 95098 and so far have been happy with them."
5,EXCELLENT DISCS,"I burn roughly 50 DVD's a month for work projects. I've gone through two 100 piece spindles with only one coaster. For playback on home theater DVD players, these have proven the most reliable of any brand out there. I typically burn videos at 4X, but these have worked perfectly at 8X and 16X. If you've found your HP Lighscribe drive a bit finiky with other brands, the Sony's have been 100% in both of mine. I'd put them in my top 3 choices for DVD media along with TDK and HP."
3,Sony DVD+R Recordable Storage Spindle (4.7GB) 100 Disc,"I ordered 4 packages of these. I thought they were printable DVD's as that is what I had been searching. This is my own fault for not checking closer. 3 of the 4 packages could not be sold as ""new"" in a store, as the wrapper was frayed and even missing from the bottom of the containers. One of them was intact."
5,AWESOME,"The DVD is the full 240 min on slowest setting which is not always true, some even run longer. Hold there sound well and picture aswell. Price is great."
2,many bad discs,I have had skips and stalls on almost all of the dvds in this pack so far. I previously had a 100 pack of memorex and they were great. I wouldn't buy these sony dvd's again
5,Sony DVD + R Recordable DVD,Received on time. The quality is built in by Sony and I always use the Sony as my Audio/Video standards.
5,TOTAL satisfaction,"Both products were delivered incrediably fast. The CD's were here within 2 days and the DVD's within 4 days as I had ordered the product on a Thursday as I remember the CD's were here by Saturday and the DVD's by the following Tuesday. I'll NEVER hesitate to order through your services, TNX, Jerry S."
3,dvd disc,"DVD machine purchased was not compatible, and the discs were rendered unusable. I opened the spindle bundle and felt I couldn't return the discs.Carmen Ward"
4,very smooth,"I really like using this pen as it writes very smoothly, almost effortlessly. I also get comments from anyone who uses it stating how much they like it. I've lost a couple pens this way and now make sure I always get it back before the borrower leaves!"
5,"Someone's lying, but who?","Sad Freddy, the safecracker, who wouldn't hurt a fly, stumbles on a corpse while doing a job. He flees in panic, leaving his tools behind. And now his wife Ernestine, an off-and-on prostitute, begs Maigret to clear Freddy of murder.Maigret decides to trust her, for the moment anyway.The trouble is, there's no corpse to be found - only a lovely home inhabited by an elegant old lady and her dentist son who deny having had a break-in. Simenon faces the daunting task of identifying an invisible corpse and the motives behind the crime (if there was one).Simenon has a genius for filling out Maigret's character bit by bit in each novel, which may partly explain why these little books are so addictive. You keep wanting more.Ernestine's levelheaded affection for her hapless husband adds to the charm of the story."
2,caution: bad focus and no sound,"I got very good impression on fuji products and when my fuji 3800 died I picked this fuji s3100. Unfortunately its focus was horrible and I had to zoom in and out to get a clear picture. It has no sound, which is another bad thing compared with 3800."
3,not bad but could be better,the camera isn't bad but they could fix some things about it. the hand that means the camera is shaking comes on all of the time. other than that i like it
3,Constantly Blurry,"I've had this camera for about a year and a half and it's a great camera if you feel the need to take about 3 shots of everything. I have taken some wonderful pictures with this camera but there have been way too many times when I took a picture, it looked great on the viewfinder and great when I reviewed the pictures on the camera but as soon as they were uploaded to the computer, I could see they weren't nearly as clear as they should have been. This isn't due to a malfunction of any sort, it's due to the fact that the screen on the back is large enough to see your pictures but gives a false sense of security when you check to make sure your picture looks good. It's also due to the fact that this camera just isn't that great. I'm now looking for a better camera since I'm tired of finding that the pictures I was so excited to print out or show to others look horrible."
5,"Camera Great, Buy.com iffy","The camera works great even though it is a refirbished unit. However it did not come complete. It is missing the adapter ring and is now out of production.Buy.com, Fuji and other locations do not have the ring. My bad for buying an out of date camera for sale."
1,Not worth the money,"Bought this camera as i have a 9 month old daughter, and want to catch all those important firsts and the cute pictures. I have to say this camera, in my opinion, is not worth the $230. First off, at fill zoom, the lense fish eyes when printing large pictures. Second off, unless you use the flash, and even then sometimes, the picture is blurred unless the subject stays absolutely still and you have this camera on a tripod. The subceptibily to not being able to autofocus due to camera shake is ridiculous. This camera without the use of a tripod is really not there because of how sensitive this is to camera shake."
5,Great Camera,"I've owned this camera for a long time and I loved it. I used it primarily to take pictures of artwork and the pictures almost always came out great. I also loved to take it to the zoo to take pictures of the animals there and those turned out great too. This camera isn't a simple camera to use in that it has a lot of features, but once you get the hang of it it's a lot of fun to take pictures with it."
2,great for non-action shots,"I bought this camera to replace a Kodak that was stolen. I bought it because it had (at the time) a higher than normal zoom (6x) and got decent reviews. After owning it for a year, I can say definitively that I LOVE it for macro shots and still photography. I HATE it for 2 reasons- it has an electronic viewfinder and not just a lens viewfinder and I HATE it for taking pictures of anything requiring any kind of quick response- the shutter takes around a second to respond and you will miss MANY shots. This is just not acceptable for me while trying to take pictures of my kids. For the first time in my life I am looking to buy another electronic item without the first one breaking, being stolen, or being outdated! If you only want to take still shots, this is a great camera. But if you want to take any pictures that include movement- find something with a quicker shutter response time."
2,"Excellent Camera, Short Life Span","Purchased 2 Fujifilm Finepix cameras. Both took excellent pictures; however, both died within 2 years and would not function at all. The cost of repair just not worth it. Now I sit without a camera which I cannot afford to fix or purchase another. As a senior citizen, this was one of my favorite hobbies. These were not 'refurbished' and I don't blame Amazon. I've read many reviews (after mine died) and the consensus was that this has happened with many Fujifilm cameras. Love the camera, but very disappointed in its life span!"
4,good cable but not so good as USB,"this a very good quality cable. It works good especially on the printers. Goes fast but if you have a USB port i will take the USB cable because is better product and more fast, it also cost less than this one."
4,Favorite Pen,"Not a ""MUST BUY"" but if you like .5mm pens, you will like it. If you write a lot, you will need to have a paper towel or the equivalent to wipe the end off every two days or so. It's sharp, and it gets paper particles in the tip. No big deal, just wipe! Great pen."
5,I agree...best pen in the world!,"I agree w/the other reviews in that this pen is really the best pen i've ever used. I am very big on writing utensils and a big fan of this pen. This pen writes smoother than any pen (including really high end pens like parker, monte blanc). it's lasts a very long time and gives an even distribution of the ink. feels lightweight. it doesn't leak through the page and dries quickly. comes in variety of colors. inevitably makes your handwriting look better than it really is (I get the most compliments when I write w/this pen). I have a hard time finding this pen in stores however, so I really hope that Pilot isn't going to stop producing them."
5,The one good thing about traffic court...,"It all started when I had to sign a receipt for traffic court and they gave me this pen... I loved it and asked the clerk if I could have it. He told me, ""Of course"". It was by far the best pen ever to grace this earth (and I'm not exaggerating). It writes very fine - the thinnest line I've seen a pen write. It doesn't leak, it doesn't stop working where you are forced to scribble a little on another sheet of paper until the pen starts working again. It writes smoothly from start to finish. And by some miracle, my hand doesn't cramp. Believe me. No matter what KIND of pen you enjoy, this one will make anyone turn to gel ink, roller ball pens. Stock up on them, because I can't find them ANYWHERE (no, not even traffic court. I was the dope who went in a few months later just for their pens. haha)"
3,pilot p500,"i really love this pen. it is very smooth and almost never drips or leaks. however, it skips when the ink is about 25% remaining. if you leave the cap off for an extended period (overnight) it will have a high tendency to skip."
1,Not Recommended,"I am currently a 4th year otolaryngology resident at a US accredited university program. I purchased this review with the hopes that it would provide me with clinical ENT pearls that would better prepare me for the in-service training exam. I must say that I was severely disappointed. The book does have many one-liner questions followed by the correct and yes, as others have stated, sometimes the INCORRECT answer, but much of the information is out-dated and not really relevant to the field today. It certainly doesn't come close to representing the in-service exam, which I have taken three times now. Over-all I would consider it ""low-yield"", and as any otolaryngology resident can attest, it is not worth our while to spend time studying low-yield material. I do not recommend this book."
1,ENT Boards? Don't Bother.,"Lots of questions with just the answer and no explanation. The topics covered are similar to actual boards, but the questions themselves aren't helpful. MANY MANY of the answers are wrong. Don't bother with this book unless you have no other source for practice question; you'll either already know the answer, know the answer is wrong, or wonder if the answers you missed you don't know or are misprints."
3,Could We Say Nuclear Assault is the ....Bomb?,"It is harsh on the ears, this reissue or remaster. Lacks any kind of bass along with John Connelly's screatchy voice. They had made a video for Critical Mass from this album. Very aggressive Punk style Thrash, Hardcore crossover. Pretty brutal stuff actually, though I personally find this style to get old fast. Even more so than normal Thrash. That's just me though, offering my opinion on Hardcore, though this does have more of a Thrashness to it. The style wears off quickly. Over all, I think it's a unique album with brutally, catchy songs with Dan Lilker on bass.If you come across SomeThing Wicked, that's their ""trying to be a normal Metal band album"". So after this release, they take a more conventional route. I'd say, Handle With Care, Survive and Game Over would be the ones to get for the aggressive Thrashy stuff. But, again, I really do find their particular style to get old very quickly."
1,"Great album, terrible CD","This is one of my favorite metal albums, but the sound on this CD is TERRIBLE. It has no high or low frequencies, so it's just flat and muddy. I opened a track in an audio editing program and the screen was just solid green, as if whoever mixed it just cranked the volume all the way up and applied a hard limiter to keep it from distorting - removing anything besides the mid-range frequencies in the process. I find it hard to believe this is original mix, since none of my other CDs from the era are like this. It's so bad it makes it hard to listen to, so I guess it's a waste of $14 since I can't return an opened CD. The cassette tape copy I made from a CD 20 years ago sounds way better.The CD is new, but is not from the original label and appears to be from Argentina (and it's not what's pictured on the Amazon.com page). The packaging says it's licensed, but the audio quality and disc printing are less than I'd expected. Very disappointing."
1,Absolute s*** album remix! Sounds t,I bought this album thinking it was remixed and it would be great but alas it's the most disappointing pile of garbage I've ever bought. I don't know if I got a bum album but the seller also screwed me out of the skull and crossbones slip cover with of course no response for return. I'm pretty upset because i've bought quite a few albums from them but this album totally sucks!!! What a wast of such an awesome original album. I truly think the original from the 80's work sound better on cassette. WARNING don't buy this POS!!!!!
2,"""Tin Robots"" would be more appropriate","I agree with Wil Overton's review (see above). This is a nicely done book for the tin-litho robot collector I suppose, but if you are looking for a real breadth of coverage on vintage space toys, in my opinion you will probably be disappointed. I am a big fan of rockets and spaceman/alien figures (Space Patrol/Tom Corbett/Rocky Jones, etc.)and found very little in this volume of interest to me. In fact, I bought it second-hand at half the publisher's price and felt it had not been a good purchase; but, then again . . . I was looking for much more than robots."
4,Vintage Toys: Robots and Space Toys (v. 1),"This volume focuses on tin toys manufactured from World War I through to the 1970s, telling a story of toy-making impacted by focuses as divergent as changes in technology and the outbreak of war. A beautiful 200 +/- page, book featuring hundreds of full color very photos of robots, spaceships and ray guns. Topics range from Buck Rogers and Cape Canaveral, to Roby Robot, Smoking Spaceman, Space Trooper and Yonezawa items."
3,"Disappointing, but not that much since expectations were low","A quick read at 160+ pages that have w - i - d - e margins and blank pages or some with only a few sentences. The hoped-for character development that the first book needed didn't really materialize in this episodic book. It jumps back and forth between the brothers Ross and Jed, and then to a third location. Plus it jumps back and forth in time, for a page or a paragraph. It's a device used more effectively in other books, and one I don't particularly enjoy anyway. I skimmed a lot of this (including the required sex scenes) and found the dialogue a little forced. We get a little more of the Thatcher extended family, but it's not enough to satisfy. On to the third and (thankfully) final installment."
2,Unhappy Ending,"Was pleased to find another story bout these two couples, not pleased with the storyline about Ross and Kevin's relationship. It was to say the least not what you expected. When you read the book you will understand. Hope the author pairs them together again."
3,Good book,"This is a very informative book and shipping was quick. I was disappointed to see the published price in the cover, since I paid almost triple that amount. I would advise anyone to shop around more than I did."
2,wow!,"1st off the color is NOT burgundy, it is a yucky light red that looks as old as my great great grandmother.. Secondly I have only used it two times so far and already it is starting to chip on the knob that reads the blood pressure!! UNBELIEVABLE!!i cant believe it. I recommend you do NOT buy this item! this item is horrible.."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"I was told that this was a good brand. Color was a big in my decision and I wanted a black one, thinking it would go with the rest of my stuff. Well when I got the sphygmomanometer, it was black and a very unattractive orange. I was very disappointed and immediately sent for a replacement. Lets hope this time I get the right one!'Needless to say, I was sent the same things over again! I am very disappointed in my purchase! It is still not the same color and my class starts in a week!"
4,A pleasant and fun-to-read novel,"Dooly's novel, ""His Brother's Castoff"" is a pleasant read and has a great cast of characters that will keep you turning pages until the very end. But be warned: reading this novel will compel you to buy up all the author's other books in this series!"
4,His Brother's Castoff,"HIS BROTHER'S CASTOFF is a well-written sweet romance that the reader is sure to love. I was able to read it in a day, so the story moved along quickly. Pick up HIS BROTHER'S CASTOFF today for a satisfying read"
5,Excellent writing and very colorful,We are doing a devotion about Noah at home this week. My kids are learning about Noah and the ark and the big flood. I thought this book was well written and understandable for the children. Very colorful and there is even a little prayer at the end of the ebook for the kids to read aloud. I'm very glad I bought this ebook. My kids love it.
1,NOT CHILD APPROPRIATE!,"The book reads like this - 'God had made a good world. Now people were spoiling it. They are always fighting. ""I'm sorry I ever made this world"", said God. ""I shall wash it away!"" '... and then goes on to how he get's Noah to make the ark & take just Noah & mother & father animals with him. I am not judging anyone's religious beliefs however I do not feel these choice of words are appropriate for kids, although I do not know the bible word for word this is not something I want my child learning or fearing that his world will just be ""washed away"" bc he does something god doesn't like.. What happen to teaching the right way and forgiveness? This book is going straight to the garbage, enough said."
2,Happy Camper,"Hi All.All I can really say about this Digital Multi-Meter is that it does work. But it is very cheaply made. And it isn't the most accurite. Spend a little bit more money and buy a better one. You get what you pay for. I bought this one, just to loan out to others who need to use a Multi-Meter, and who just might forget to return it. Not saying they are dishonest, but stuff happens. Thats why I don't loan out my good tools."
2,Nothing particularly new here.,This is just another themed deck that adds nothing special to the Rider Waite family of imagery. Yes the pictures have an Eastern flaire...the insights pretty much stop there.
5,Owns my $200 Mont Blanc,"I've been using this pen for at least 5 years. I've had several people try to steal it over the years, and I have given them away as gifts. Everyone loves this pen. I own one of each color. I always worry they will stop making it. Hopefully, they do not try to fix what is not broken and never breaks."
4,Second best,"This pen is a very good pen, I like that's its retractable the only thing I didn't like is that it smears. I do prefer the Bic Z4 needle point 0.5 over this one. (It has rubber grip but not retractable) All in all I would buy more of the Q7 pens."
5,Great pens,This pen is comfortable to use for long periods and the ink delivery is very smooth. This pen does do a great job keeping a constant flow of ink to the paper for a gel ink pen.
1,Writen by sixth graders,Snarky teenager finds out his step dad is a vampire who wants to take over the world with gooey green demons. Kid saves the world!Acting; C-Plot; D+Special effects; D-To borrow from another review of a worthless waist of time and money; 'writen by sixthgraders'.
3,"Can You Say ""Vega?""","Vee-ga or Vay-ga? Kerrod won't tell you in his series of ""Planet Library"" books. Despite it's lack of proncunciation guides, the series -- like ""Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors"" for example -- is very well written with a reader-friendly layout. There are plenty of recent NASA/ESA color pictures and drawings, and the binding will make the books last well into the next century. All of Kerrod's information is accurate, but sometimes slighly skewed; fpr example, he mentions the ""Mars canals"" mix-up with Schiaparelli and Lowell, but does not explain that the problem was translating ""canali"" to canals, not channels. But give Kerrod his due: it's not easy to distill so many scientific concepts for young readers, and ultimately Kerrod does a good job covering a broad range of astronomy topics, and includes just enough 'fun facts' to keep young readers smiling while they learn."
5,High quality match for my Sony LCD HDTV,"In the past six months I have purchased two different Sony wall mount brackets. One for our 52 inch Sony LCD in the Living room and another one for the 46 inch Sony LCD in the family room. I am very pleased with both as they are very sturdy, fairly easy to install and hold the TV's in place quite solidly. We live in earthquake country so I wanted to make sure that I got a quality wall mounting bracket to support our new TV's. I know they are more expensive then some of the ""universal"" mounts but when you spend $$$ for a new TV it doesn't make sense to me to scrimp on the hardware that will hold it to the wall. These brackets are heavy duty, good quality mounts that do the job for us."
2,Sony SUWL500 Wall Mount Bracket,"I ordered this wall mount bracket as recommended by the manufacter. However, it was not flexible enough to use. I had to return it. There was no adjustment to center the bracket on the wall if it was mounted into the studs as directed. The return was easy and the refund was very prompt."
5,TV Wall mount,Fast shipping. Instructions were easy to understand. Had it mounted on my wall in less than an hour. Fitted to TV perfectly.
5,Easy install,"I have a 52"" Sony Bravia the model number was not listed in the product manual (however) when I visited the sony style web site and did a model search for ""wall Mount"" It return the same part number and was reatied at $100 more on the sony site.I ordered it and had it installed in hour after receiving it. Directions were great."
4,Installation manual could have been better,"Solid construction and worked great with my Bravia 52w3000. The price was a bit steep for what it was (maybe that's for all flat panel mounts) but it fit perfectly. The instruction manual didn't have the right info for my TV as it was newer, but it was readily available on the Sony website. My beef was that the instruction manual could have been much clearer. it stated that the screws should be 8mm or larger but don't believe 8mm screws fit the holes in the brackets. Also, the measurement guidelines could have been better although my installation ended up fine."
5,bratz rule!,this item is cool for girls and cool to learn to put makeup on you and to learn to put makeup on somebody!
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting the Spode bone china pattern, NOT earthenware. Unless you drill down through, you will not be aware that it was earthenware. The main ad doesn't mention that or that this dinnerware set is made in China. I will be returning it! To be fair, I was not aware that Spode made their Christmas Tree pattern in anything BUT fine bone china so I did not drill down through to the more detailed information. I should have realized by the price that this was not the 'real deal'. It IS marked SPODE but it is not the Spode made in the UK. I would have done better going to the company or ebay and buying a used 5 piece dinnerware set."
1,Bad paint chipping,I have had the same problem with the green paint chipping off. I would not recommend Spode Christmas Tree pattern to anyone and this has made me reverse a decision to buy another Spode china pattern. Cheaper is not better!
1,CHEAP,"NOT ALL made in England, only a few pieces and the ones made in Malaysia look like $h!+. I have 10 settings made in England, wanted 12 but NOT from this place."
1,The Green Paint Flakes off,"I too have a collection of the Spode Christmas Tree pattern and the green paint has chipped off of several of the dishes. I returned them and vowed never to put one in the dishwasher, which I haven't and the new ones have the same problem. With very careful care, hand washing, drying etc. the green trim continues to flake off. I have given up on this pattern and am now collecting the Lenox ""Holly"" Pattern,"
3,slightly dissapointed,"I have been buying Spode for years. I love them. They are really beautiful. However, recents purchases have not had the quality as my older dishes. I've noticed that on the newer dishes, the bottom bottom side is not smooth. It's rough, has bubbles and holes. I don't like the way they feel."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I purchased 8 place settings of the Spode Christmas Tree pattern for my wife for Christmas. Every set was seriously defective, many places had no glazing at all. There were rough spots throughout, including very bad places on the rims of cups. This is the worst quality in dishes of any price I have ever seen. Do not buy this product; you will be deeply disappointed."
4,wars and babylon,"war gods of babylon is a typical 60's adventure and not a bad plot line, well scored and although the actors aren't big names they didn't do a bad job.war goddess will appeal to those who can suspend their geographical correctness (amazons come from an entirely different continent than the greeks and scythians) some good competitive sword play wrestling bow shooting comp at the beginning, the meeting between the greeks and the amazons is amusing as the amazons are chanting that men are intolerable etc whilst making out. a bit of fun."
3,same movie differant title/ the original????,"I bought the dvd for the Terence Young ""war goddess"" first I think this was copied from a vhs copy with a different title. LOTS of noise lines etc on the dics, vhs quality.I found another copy of same movie on an movie upload site which was more close to ""master Quality"" sharp no lines or blurs, sharp color...etc. that went by the name Terence Youngs : ""AMAZONS"". I think I'll keep the copy from the upload site and use the dvd I got for a door stop. If you look around You'll find a far superior copy of this movie than this DVD on the internet.....I was disapointed."
2,4-bit nonsense,"unless my port configurations are strange, which i'm sure they aren't, this cable is only capable of 4-bit transfers.. that is, around 70k/sec at most. junk compared to universal FAST cables or even 8-bit. you get what you pay for, i guess."
1,Terrible edition of a wonderful story--,"The Kindle edition of Twain's book is awful! Nearly every page has a typo and the errors are so numerous and jarring that the reading is really spoiled. What a shame. It appears that the copy editor was asleep or hoping that spell check would cover it. Also, there are large gaps in the text block. Altogether a terrible job. But buy the book and read the story -- it's wonderful!"
2,Not up to my expectations,"Being a book by Mark Twain, I expected a little more of the smart, savvy commentary usual in Twain's writing. This book reads more like a religious text,with a few satiric lines about church and/or civil authorities. The language makesit difficult to read.The Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (The Complete Novels of Mark Twain)"
3,art work of cover,"book is ok, but who is the artist of the picture on cover.?Twain brings perhaps to much fictional addition to the story"
5,Ladies Edition,It was a great CD. I would like every man to listen to this if they are in love with a good woman.
5,Top 1%,"I am listening to this album right now, and in the context of 500 R&B/soul albums that I own, this is one of the best. First of all the vast majority of the songs are good; often an album will only have a few songs you would include in a playlist. Secondly, the songs are well produced, original, and distinguished by a bassy, rhythmic, soulful, passionate style - real swingy, body moving R&B that demands proper bass reproduction from hi-fi systems. This is my favourite type of black music which combines the following elements: slow tempo, funky, rhymic, catchy beats and bass, well produced musical arrangements, souful harmonies, predominantly found in music from 1993 - 1997. I think H-Town are probably under-rated, and certainly here in the UK they are almost anonymous. This is a pity because all their albums are strong and are thoroughly recommended."
1,Disappointed,I purchase my CD on 2/23/12 and it's now 3/26/12 and i still haven't received my CD!NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER!!
1,They Don't Erase,"You would think that Dry Erase markers would erase from your white board. Think again, I just spent 1/2 hour scrubbing my hardest with ""Expo 2 White Board Cleaner"" and I am very much regretting my purchase of this product."
5,Music to soothe the soul.,An old timer like me has memories associated with this kind of music. It is good background sound for the daily routine. Thank you!
2,Unreliable,"The pump failed before one jug of water was dispensed.However, before it failed, it performed quite well as advertised."
5,A Great little pump,We bought this water pump for our cottage. It works really good & is easy to use. Very reasonably priced.
2,Avoid this item,"It's really really bad quality and doesn't look clean out of the box, it looked like someone carved some parts to make it fit together. I see half cut plastic piece dangling inside.Shipping costs too much -- I wanted to return, but I won't get refund for the shipping, and the shipping costs more than the item."
1,Low quality,"This is a very low quality item, pieces broke off right away. It says in the description that it fits most standard 5 gallon bottles, we have 2 different ""standard"" bottles, and it doesn't fit either. The tube goes only 2/3 down the bottle, making it rather pointless. So, not a tight fit, pump part is very cheap and looks like it's not going to last more than a month (I will definitely add to this review a few weeks from now) and it does not fit standard 5 gallon bottles. Do not waste your money on this, better put an extra $10-20 and get something decent."
3,Good while it lasted...,"You get what you pay for. It was good while it lasted but then it fell apart, not sure how or why but it just stopped pumping, I guess a spring became lose and I was not able to fix it. When it was working it was the easiest thing, it could really pump out a lot of water."
4,Amazon products,"We have ordered and used the drinking water hand pump previously. We ordered a spare and one as a gift for a friend's Deer camp. I am very pleased with the product.But, I would also like you to know, I cannot say enough about the customer service, products, and timed delivery that Amazon has provided each and everytime I have placed an order through them. I actually enjoy doing business through Amazon.You are a very rare business, please don't change!Sincerely,Wanda Thompson"
1,"No Instructions, Use and Care","My manual Dolphin water pump arrived from GammaDiscount without instructions or use and care documentation (i.e., how to assemble and sanitize, how to contact mfr for parts/problems, warranty). There is a website on the outside of the box, but when you go to it, it's primarily for sales with no customer support links. Perhaps it's because the box I received appears to have been previously opened and it could be why the manual is missing, but the pump's web site should also provide this information as well. I am very disappointed with this product. It is incredible that someone would be permitted to make (in Korea, with no North or South listed), let alone sell these in the USA without ensuring that consumers receive info on how to clean and maintain something that comes in direct contact with their drinking water!"
3,water pump does job,The pump does the job but I wonder how long it will last. Made of cheap materials.
4,H Town at its finest........,"Even though this cd was released 5 years ago (!994), this is the best collection of the trios music. The groups sexy style works best with the 2 outstanding ballads, ""Emotions"" and the alluring yet tasteful ""One Night Gigolo"". Dino, Shazam, Gi and producer Stick wrote all the tracks material, making it not as diversified as otther male groups in the 90's. It would be intersting if they worked with other writers and producers for there 4th cd....Other tracks that are tight are the jeep blasting ""Rockit Steady"", ""Indo love"" and ""Baby I ya"" in which lead vocalist Dino solos on......."
3,i just love emotions,evry time i close my eyes i wake wishing h-town was sitting im my living room if you could just let him just be int there i'll go to sleep r
2,Natural Vitamin E,"I think I read the same article as the person who wrote the previous review did. I purchased a couple of jars since they were cheap. The seller shipped them so VERY fast, they got here 4 days before the delivery estimate. I have been using it for a week now. I read is almost like a miracle, and that the first application was the most drammatical. Well....it hasn't done anything for me yet. I don't have that much acne, just a couple of scars left. They still are there. I keep using it to try to see if, over time, they will eventually fade, and I purchased the product, so I gotta do something with it. I still stick to my Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula. I like it better. It works faster. In the meantime, I'll keep on using them and wait a little more to see IF scars fade. This product could use a dispenser. It's a little difficult to apply from the jar it comes. Some of the jars were a little open when they got here, there was not too much lost, but everything was greasy."
1,Buy only with extended warranty,This camera has a problem that might not show up for awhile. In my case it revealed itself after a year and two month. One day fingerprint like lines appeared on prints. They are invisible on LCD monitor but cover the picture area on the computer monitor and on prints. Search the Internet and you will find many similar complaints.
1,Great camera - when it works,This camera is great when it is working. My camera is in the repair department for the second time with the same problems. It is taking pictures with lines/bands running through them. It took months with much confusion to get my camera back last time and already this time I am getting the run-around. I will not buy Fuji again because their customer service is poor.
3,beware the zoom error,"I have had this camera for over 2 years and have LOVED the photo quality and ease of use. The camera is very quick, takes great macro shots and doesn't eat up (rechargeable) batteries.That being said, 2 days ago it started overexposing my pictures. Then it locked up completely. I was able to get my pictures downloaded off of it, but, after reading other online reviews (especially of Fuji's poor customer service and the persistance of this problem with Fuji cameras) I am now shopping around for a new camera. I will not be buying another Fuji, which is too bad, because I really did love it while it worked.For a review of many other users with this problem:[...]"
1,Blurry Pictures - AWFUL customer support,"I was so excited to get this camera and did lots of research. The camera indoors takes pictures that blurs upon the slightest movement with little hope to be had in fixing the problem. The customer support and repair department are the WORST I have ever dealt with and I'm usually very understanding and patient. It sounds like they are shuffling through piles of papers when talking to me, they've lost communications that were attached the camera when submitted for repair and are disinterested in all conversations. I will NEVER buy another product from FUJI."
1,Malfunctioned after 3 days,"I had this camera for three days when the built-in zoom lens broke, rendering the camera unusable. Zoom error appeared in the LCD and I could not take any pictures. I tried replacing the batteries as the troubleshooting section sugests, but that did not work. I contacted the place I bought it from, and they said that the camera was defective and needs to be returned. I ended up buying a Sony DSC-W7, and I'm very happy with it."
1,Poor auto focus unless in very bright light.,I would look elsewhere for a camera unless you don't mind using the flash all of the time. The auto focus (when not using a flash ) on this camera is very poor in anything but very bright sunlight. I've taken several shots in very well lit conditions and the images come out blurry. You pretty much have to use the flash all of the time. I believe Fuji addressed this problem in another camera (I don't recall the model).
3,It's an average camera,"I have had this camera for only five months and the Zoom Error just occurred a couple of days ago. I was NOT happy and thought that I had a serious problem. So, I jumped onto here to read the reviews and saw that others had had the problem too and I found out how to fix the problem myself and the idea worked! YAY!! Thank you to the person who posted it. It may be a temporary solution but at least I know what to do if it happens again. Overall it's a good camera but if I could go back to before I purchased it I would have bought another camera."
4,Pretty Good Camera,Pros: The Fuji E550 takes good pictures in a variety of lighting conditions. This camera is very quick to start up and lag time between shots is very short. It's easy to navigate through the menus and the buttons and controls are laid out logically. The compact size is not a hindrance to using it. The included software (FinePixViewer and ImageMixer VCD2) are easy to install and pretty straight forward to use. You will probably want a more sophisticated photo editing program for composing / cleaning up your shots.Cons: It does have a couple of drawbacks. The memory card that ships with it is way too small. Removing the memory card is not practical so connecting to your computer via USB is necessary. There is a mechanical switch you must use to change between taking photos and viewing or deleting what's on the camera. I question how long this switch will last.Overall Impressions: I like this camera and would recommend it.
2,Watch Out For This Camera,"This camera has a problem with overexposing and shuttering effects on uploaded photos. Fujifilm denies this as a chronic, recallable problem, but the Internet camera forums are filled with people (like me) who bought this defectively designed camera.Buy a Canon or a Nikon. Fujifilm doesn't deserve your business."
1,"#1 DOA, #2 30 Days, Waiting for #3","The first 550 we purchased was DOA. Returned to seller, and replaced with #2. #2 worked for 30 days, then dead. Past sellers return limit, so sent to Fuji. 3 weeks now, waiting for replacement... Don't buy this camera!!"
5,I love this camera!,"I am so in love with this camera, it served me well for 3 years until my toddler destroyed it. I now have the dilemma of finding a new camera I will love as much. It was so easy to use, took sharp beautifully colored photos, preformed outstanding in low light situations, I had no problem printing large photos without any graininess. I'm tempted to just buy the same camera, but in 3 years I am assuming there have been major improvements and I can find something even better. I hope!"
4,Great for the price!,"This camera has served me well over the last few years. There are a few things that you need to be aware of however. The first thing is that the flash has a delay. You have to wait for it to recharge in between each picture if you are using the flash and that can take at least 6-8 seconds. Taking pictures of children can be challenging if you are using the flash! With that said, the camera has been great. It is very simple to learn!"
4,First Camera and I am not disappointed,"I decided that since I have no expertise with cameras, and I needed one for my new job, I would go for a factory refurbished one. So far this camera is everything I could possibly want.Good battery life with Nimh rechargeable batteries, great clear pix, easy to use. The LCD came with some minor scratches, but I guess on a refurb thats to be expected. I like this camera also because it has a viewfinder which a lot of the new cameras do not have.I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for an easy to use well made, inexpensive camera to work with."
1,You know I had this camera before.. so I don't know what went wrong with this one.,It has a battery life of about 3 shots and then shuts itself off. I'm to say the least quite surprised since I owned this model before and my old one died a natural death. This is now officially a bad purchase and I'm out the 50 bucks I spent. I hope the seller didn't know this and sell me a clunker but I've changed the nice shiny new batteries multiple times and it does the same.. click turn on and immediately shut off.Too bad for my wallet.
4,Fair price for the product,"Bought this just weeks before a two-week road trip, and had to learn in a hurry. Camera is a step up from my Nikon Cool Pix. Optical viewfinder is a must-have. Camera comes with bonus stuff - cords, card, batteries & charger, although the card is too small. Recommend buying an additional 1G card, a camera case, and at least 2 more pair of NIMH batteries. On active shoots, batteries only lasted 4 hours. Camera has more options than Cool Pix and additional lenses are available. Good stabilization. Have not tried video yet."
2,common lens defect - read this before buying,"I am one of the many purchasers who likes this camera but suffered the dreaded zoom error (see the reviews of others who had the same problem). According to a Fujifilm technical service representative (who was very familiar with the problem), it occurs because the lens is designed to come out so rapidly. Fujifilm is replacing the current lens assembly, but it is not clear when that change is taking place.If this problem happens to you, the repair to replace the lens assembly will cost about $150 unless the camera is within its one year warranty. Fuji estimates repair time will be about 4 weeks.So think hard before you buy this camera and ask lots of questions. I really like the ability to take rapid shots in succession, intuitive menus (unlike my Canon), and excellent picture quality. However, I probably would not have bought it if I had known of this design defect."
1,FINEPIX E550,I bought this camera after it was rated a 'bestbuy' at Consumer Reports. The flash is extremely flimsy and I have never seen a point and shoot camera with such a rinky flash setup which needs to be extended before use. After 4 days in the Grand Canyon the camera began vignetting and overexposing and no amount of tinkering with the exposure settings have improved this fault. All in all it has become useless. This has definitely soured me on Fuji cameras and I will look elsewhere to Nikon or Canon for my next camera.
2,Random and dated,"This collection of random shots of the mountain's eruption, coupled with comically melodramatic voiceover and a dated soundtrack, make this hard to watch."
2,All sounds the same,All the songs sound basically the same - whining voice over a fairly good sound track.
2,title of review,"This is really bad. Worse than their old stuff even. The vocalist doesn't sing, just speaks/yells, in a fake british/colonial accent, like he's giving a dramatic speech. It's so stupid. I guess it kinda reminds me of The Van Pelt, but I like that band, so I don't want to make that comparison. It kinda reminds me of Interpol, both the vocals and music. Even if the music was good the ridiculous vocals might ruin it for me, but the music is weak and boring. This band is just stupid."
3,Pretty but tarnishes.,I really like the look of this. It is a bit heavy but attractive. My only problem is that it has tarnished pretty bad in the few months that I have had it.
3,Not a bad read but...,"I bought this book second hand from Amazon and once I received it I had read it in one evening. At first it had quite easily blown me away. From joining at an early age after meeting a legionnaire at a train station in France, experiencing the brutality of training and life in the French Foreign Legion, serving in Africa and in the parachute regiment and of cause the crazy antics of what he and his fellow legionnaires got up to during their leave. I believed it painted one man's raw, honest and personal account of his service with La Legion. Yet.. the reason why I give this review 3 stars is because I have received information, from a number of ex legionnaires, that Sloane was in fact a legion deserter. Having said that I did still enjoy this book."
4,Not so naked,"Im a Navy vet but always had a fascination with the Legion. Of the 10 or so books I've read I would rate this one very high. Much better than the deserter book ""Legion of the Lost"". Good old fashion memoir type book. Plus it gives some detailed info that other books haven't. Still wishing for a book written by someone who didn't serve in the 2 Para Reg., especially the calvary one. Other than that this book goes well with Simon Murray's book."
5,Clear window,"I quite enjoyed this book. It was fairly well written, a pretty easy read, and overall provides a clear window thru which to view what life in the French Foreign Legion would be like. Having served in the US Army, I found that many aspects of the book translate well into my own military experiences, though obviously not nearly to the ""hard-core"" degree of which the author experienced. That being said, I connected well with his stories of fellow soldiers... the friends you make, the enemies you detest, and so on. If nothing else, this book has me day-dreaming of joining the Army Rangers or some other such tough-guy unit.I myself found no glaring faults with the book, and have already gifted it to a couple of my Army buddies, who similarly enjoyed the read. And so it is that I recommend this book to all those who are wish for an easy read on service in the Foreign Legion."
4,The Naked Soldier: A True Story of the French Foreign Legion,Great book for those of us who thought about running off to join the Legion. Very sobering for the hopeless romantic.Very real stories from his experiences; no Rambo tales.A great read.
3,Fairly Interesting Story,"As I stated in the title, was a fairly interesting book. Well enough written, and easy to read. The story is a memoir of an 18 year old Englishman who spend 5 years in the FFL. The book is all grueling training, excessive drinking and attempts to get laid. He was stationed in Africa, which was interesting--but there was no combat experiences.I think my 4 years in the USN was more interesting."
