4,"The man fron Greek and Roman, an old fashioned charmer","I first read this book 30 years ago and, though it has no pretensions to literary greatness, it has a certain old fashioned charm with likeable characters, a feel good, if predictable, ending and a rollicking swift moving tale. sometimes things don't have to be imposing to be endearing and I rediscovered this book as a fondly remembered old friend."
1,The pole is good but...,"The pole works just fine. However, the NG info on the pole is unreadable due to the delamination of the data onto the shaft. I didn't buy the pole for the foot to meters conversion but the workmanship on the shaft is just so shoddy you would'nt want to hand it to anyone to ""admire"". NG should not be associated with such poor workmanship."
2,Great of a show piece,"This was not a good purchase, a waste of money. I have a Leki walking stick that I love but this walking stick as not up to the quality that I expected. It had trouble locking in place and would let you down at the worst times."
3,"Serves its purpose, but could be better","Serves its purpose, but could be better: I would rather have seen more attention to quality and primary function, and skip the gratuitous writing all over it. I mean, making it longer for stand-up monopod takes several turns, then its hard to know where to put it back to when you want to return to using it as a cane (and the same several turns). Instead of the writing on the side, perhaps a wallet size card... Reminder: its not quite tall enough to keep from having to bend your legs when using it as a monopod if you are normal adult height. And the handle takes some getting used to (I still dont like it, although I've adapted)."
4,oh gravy,"works as promised, not sure about the spiral in the spout, just blocked the flow as well as the fat"
3,Not impressed,"I purchased this one and another with the hole in the bottom. This one is too small, but even if I had the larger one, it wouldn't work better. Without a pipe cleaner you can't wash the spout properly...grease remained in it even after a hot soapy bath. Also, I couldn't get as much broth out without the grease coming too as I could with the other. I thought oxo was a brand I liked, but this is the third item I have purchased of theirs that was not as good as expected."
2,Effective but not as heat resistant as I'd have liked,"Had this fat separator for a couple months and had used it with good results. The plunger to fill the spout with air is surprisingly effective at keeping fat out of the spout. Was reducing some pan drippings a couple weeks back and didn't have time to let them cool (my sous vide partridges - just browned - were already starting to get cold). So I dumped the contents into my handy-dandy fat separator and to my dismay the plastic body started to deform. To its credit, it didn't spring a hole and spew forth boiling grease onto my counter (and then floor), but I had to toss the sauce and make due with a sauceless entree. Will go with a laboratory glass model this round. A bit more expensive, but not if you have to buy only one of them."
4,OXO Fat Separator,"Works well, on Turkey Day. If you don't like a little fat in your gravy. My mother had a simple one, but that was then."
4,2 Cups works better than 4 Cups to me,"Initially, I bought the bigger 4 cups of this separator, simply believing that ""Bigger can do smaller jobs"". However, I had a hard time to separate fat. My guess for why it did not work with 4 cup was the total amount of liquid was not enough to the level of fat to stay high. Yes, I was right. Everything works perfectly with this smaller 2 cup fat separator.My recommendation is: Unless you do not have a huge amount of liquid, such as from big thanksgiving turkey, buy this 2 cups not 4 cups. Based on my experience, 2 cups is well enough for normal size of braising/roasting dishes. Moreover, if you have a huge amount of liquid, you just devide the amount into two batches and separate them twice. You have a flexibility to do so with this 2 cup separator but not with the larger 4 cup one."
5,Works great + OXO quality = 5 Stars,"I really cannot find any fault with this item. It does exactly what it says it does and is very easy to use. OXO is one of my favorite kitchen gadget companies, so you can't go wrong there.The only recommendation I would make is that I wish I had purchased the 4 cup model. The 2 cup unit fills up faster than I had envisioned and when you get to the point of being full it is easy to create spillage because it starts seeping into the top part. When you pour it can be a problem if you have filled it all the way up. I'd like to have some comfort room so when I get my time machine, I will go back and purchase the 4 cup one instead! :)"
5,Works wonderfully,This works great. You have to put the little stopper in before you add the liquid. It keeps the liquid out of the spout and the fat is trapped floating on top in the main compartment. This separator couldn't work better. Get one instead of trying to skim fat off with a spoon. That's tiresome and this gets it all in seconds.
4,"Received promptly, does what it's supposed to","For some reason I could not find one of these things in the usual places. I chose the smaller of the ones available at Amazon, and it work as it should. No surprises. Expectations met."
5,excellant product,"With proper care this product should last a long time. One word of caution, do not put the fat stopper in your dishwasher. This is typical Oxo Good Grips quality product. The strainer works well and I haven't had any problems defatting any liquid I put in it."
5,"No fuss, no muss fat separator","Separating the fat from the broth after boiling meat, took only one minute and this one utensil! Perfect! Why didn't I invest in something so useful and practical 30 years ago???"
1,Worst Purchase I've Ever Made.,"I owned this printer for a few weeks. I was printing brochure pages on glossy paper and the printer turned all of the white areas grey. I tried al of their customer service suggestions none of which helped. Finally, after sending print samples to Lexmark they admitted it was a known problem with the printer however only certain people noticed the ""graying"". They also stated that a different printer would be no better because they all of the C532DN printers had the effect and that some customers simply did not notice it. They did graciously offer to refund me my full purchase price. However it has been 6 months and I have yet to receive the refund although they have had my printer for several months and I have spent hours waiting on hold... Stay away!!!! Get anything but this printer. Based on Lexmark's customer service I suggest you stay away from Lexmark all together."
1,Don't buy!,"I too had the ""graying"" problem that one other review mentioned. I found that replacing the black toner fixed the problem for a while, but that means replacing the toner cartridge before it is empty! In general the printer eats toner rapidly and the replacement cartridges are costly. It has turned out to be very expensive to operate. A definite ""do not buy"" recommendation from me!"
5,They do the job. I'm very happy,"I got these to make my commuter bike more comfortable. I put them on an old steel Raleigh 10 speed in place of the drops and they make a huge difference in comfort. You have to replace the cables with longer ones, but sitting up to commute is fantastic. The bars are steel and so a little heavier than alloy, but that is irrelevant to the commuter. Love them. Prompt delivery as well."
4,It's good for what I do.,"I got this as a Christmas present from my parents. And it's perfect for what I use it for! I usually like to take short clips of my family, friends, or whatever and make them into slideshows that are viewable on Youtube. This camera is compact, the buttons and menu are easy to navigate. I'm not too fond of the way the microphone picks up the sound when you zoom, but I usually play over the sound with music. Not too big of a problem there. I edit my clips on a Mac, so I have to take one extra (but not too complicated) step to convert the ASF files to a Quicktime file. All in all, I'm very happy with this product and hope to have it for years to come!"
1,terrible,"Bad image, blurry videos, like a cheap webcam. I returned it right away and got a Samsung SC-MM10 MPEG4 10x mini-camcorder for $60 more and I'm very happy with it."
4,The World Of Suzie Wong,The VHS played perfectly. I had no problems with this product. I bought it for a friend who really wanted it.
5,Linda Strozier,"I enjoyed it very much, i watch it over and over again sometimes! i thought Nancy Kwan was very sexy playing her part, and William Holden was handsome as ever!!!!"
2,Poor Condition,"The World of Suzie Wong was a great movie to see again despite the many flaws of the VHS tape. The movie was constantly interrupted with bliing distortions. I do realize that the tape was many years old but one can only hope.I bought the VHS tape because there was not a dvd in the viewing format for the United States. The price for such a format was expensive. I am hoping that they will put more old and great movies in the viewing format for the USS.The movie is really a five star movie for style, setting and story line. The company did reimburse me."
1,World of Suzie Wong,"I could not watch this movie, it came defective. Trying to find receipt to return. Was disappointed really wanted to enjoy this movie."
3,The World of Suzie Wong,The World of Suzie Wong is a masterpiece that many movies being made today could take a lesson from the acting in it is outstanding and Nancy Kwan as Suzie Wong is simlpy beautiful. She has the looks and comes across with an act of having a hard edge to her charcter but you can tell her character is very insecure and you find yourself wanting to reach out and help her. William Holden is Fantastic as a struggling painter who falls for Suzie also this movie is the best I've ever seen and I think alot of people who have not seen it before would love it too... check it out you won't be sorry
5,A great love story filmed in one of the greatest cities!,"If you have been to, or lived on, Hong Kong this movie is a must see. The Star Ferry as it was, the vibrancy of a city that never stops. William Holden in one of his best roles and Nancy Kwan make a terrific couple for a love story that is poignant and rich with character. Love knows no cultural or class boundaries and this film proves that point. I will watch it any time and highly recommend it. You'll enjoy it."
4,"Great package and sound, most tracks previously released","This limited edition release by Universal/Hip-O Select collects all Cass Elliot's solo material between the years 1968-71 and includes a beautifully produced booklet with full discography. If you're a big fan of Cass's music this 38-tracker is a must, but there is little new here for either the fan or casual listener: most of the tracks have previously been compiled on many other collections. The 3 previously unreleased tracks are fine but certainly inessential, while ""Different"" is also now available on the recently released ""Pufnstuf"" soundtrack. I'd recommend the recent ""Dream A Little Dream Of Me: The Music of Mama Cass Elliot"" anthology as a better overview; it includes the fantastic ""(If You're Gonna) Break Another Heart"" (a superb lost classic penned by Lee Hazlewood) and the otherwise-unavailable ""East Of The Sun (And West Of The Moon)"", as well as an hilarious trilogy of radio jingles."
2,Standard Cass with a curios thrown in,"I am a huge life long fan Mama Cass, but not of greatest hits collections and such. I'd much rather buy the albums in their original form. But as in the case of Cass, you cannot find those albums unless it is on vinyl so I settled with this CD and also the collection called ""Dedicated To The One I Love"". Stick with the latter, this one has the same songs with a few strange ones thrown in with the mix. Maybe this is why CD sales are dropping but vinyl records are making a small comeback?"
5,khaled is the best,"everything this guy does is great. not many americans know about rai music, but i can't see how anyone wouldn't enjoy it. didi is the most danceable song i've ever heard. all his songs have more than enough beat to make you want to dance the night away, but the arab rythyms and singing are also pleasing enough just to listen to. great stuff."
4,"Riveting, Real-Life Drama","Once I began reading Kathy's story, I was so involved with her character that, the next thing I knew...I had finished the book. This all-too-true life drama was so riveting and real that I found myself cringing at times; feeling the fury of the abuse that she endured time and again. I found myself rooting for her and applauding her for finally realizing her own self-worth. Any woman who has lived in the glaring anger or even the shadow of abuse can relate to this story and find herself wanting to reach for the light. Women : There is a light, even at the end of a broken and battered tunnel. If reading Kathy's book helps you to realize that, I have but one thing to say : Click !"
4,Very instructive book and technology for healing,Vey good book for instruction on a new technology that appears to work for me . It is for a do it yourself technology. More info is needed to do for others.
2,Pieces don't fit together correctly,"The mat is OK, the pieces don't all fit together correctly and some are a bit thicker than others. In the future I would go with another brand, but for now my daughter has fun taking them apart after I put them back together."
1,"Very strong Ammonia smell, BAD for the kids","Very strong Ammonia smell, BAD for the kids. there are better ones I bought than this."
1,Not what it says!,"first of all it says alphabet, numbers & Animals playmat, it has no animals and was missing two letters.second of all it says covers 40 sq ft, but when it came the package clearly says covers 36 sq ft.very upset and disappointed with this product. I previously purchased two of these last year this one is nothing like the other two, they have full alphabet, 0-9 numbers 4 animals and border. It was a thicker mat too, and same brand."
2,Could be better!,The letters and numbers tend to always come out. I thought they would have been a little more snug. Also one of the pieces came without a number. I would not recommend this mat to anyone.
2,waste of money,"I thought it was perfect for my 6 month old for tummy time, and learnin to crawl. This thing is so unsturdy. The pieces are all like a puzzle and foam, and you have to put the whole thing together and take it apart every time you want to take it away. So annoying. Everytime you walk on it, it breaks apart. It's huge too. That's why I wated it in the first place, but I was so annoyed with it I just gave it away...totally not worth the price."
5,Practical Fun,I love this mat. Wether it's to keep the spills of the rug or to protect my daughter when she fall. Also when she starts to learn it will help. I love it and recommend it to everyone.
4,A murder mystery with an enchanting romance.,"The Earl of Her Dreams by Anne Mallory is a mystery with twist of romance. Kate is pretending to be man and finds herself sharing a room at the local inn with another man (Christian aka Earl of Canley). Christian was sent to the inn to steal back a journel so is dresses in his servants clothes but he finds himself mixed up in solving a murder with Kate... Check out all Anne Mallory's books Masquerading the Marquess, Daring the Duke , The Viscount's Wicked Ways and coming in August 2007 What Isablla Wants."
2,So much potential...but...,"The plotline was weak, and I found the relationship between Christian and Kate (repeated physical intimacy out of marriage, without a care that Kate would get pregnant), to be very unrealistic. Also I just found it disturbing that Christian in one of the scenes, seduces Kate inside the room where the murder had taken place. And both Christian and Kate did not have a strong enough motive to investigate the crime the way they did in the story. This story had so much potential, it could have been really good, but it's not."
5,outstandingphotoshop text,This is the best [photoshop book I've read It is a good read; and a handy resourceany one could better wotrk phtshp with Deke's approach! a worthy investment of time &$
4,Wow,"So far this book is great, I am about 1/2 way through it. I have learned so much and the author is actually very funny - makes it interesting and entertaining not just some boring manual that is a real drag to work with.I haven't been able to get the CD that came with it to work though. Not on my lap top or my other machine. It just doesn't register that its there at all, both machines. So I have to use my own pics as samples and I don't get to use some of his tricks and other things."
4,Great with a few minor glitches,"The good news:The book is set up along basic activities you need to do (move an object to a different background, fix color and contrast settings, paste a logo on a 3-D object, etc.) rather than a boring software manual ticking of the functions one by one.The author has a great sense of humorThe book looks fantasticIt comes with lots of prepared practice files on a CD.The glitches:The free training DVD is very useful but crashes many times on my PC, even after installing all updates. A shame.Another IT issues, getting the author's preferred settings installed on my PC took some effortThe author uses a lot of short-cuts for functions, I would have preferred to introduce functions with the proper menus. Readers can move on to short cuts themselves when they have mastered the basics.All in all an excellent book, which got me from 0 to using Photoshop frequently for my client presentations."
5,Great Book - Even greater videos,This is a very good book for the beginner. The videos are from the same company that produces the videos that comes with Photoshop CS except they are very in-depth. I do photography and web development and this book does a good job of covering the basics.
2,Had trouble downloading the customized settings,"Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a ""dummies"" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance."
5,Excellent tutorial,"This is another of Deke McClelland's programs which is instructive, detailed and helpful in getting to know one's way around CS2."
3,Ok introduction to photoshop but not much beyond that,"This book is ok. It covers the basic of photoshop from a general user's perspective and say a photographer's or artist's. It has some very basic exercise that help you learn you way around photoshop but with the exception of a tip on using the high pass filter, doesn't really offer much in the way of really useful info."
2,photoshp cs2,"The book only refers to a few actions you can use in CS2. There are better choices in the market, that allow you to search in CS2 more deeply."
2,Sub-Par for SLR Photographers,"If you're looking for a book with painfully drawn out explinations and unispiring pictures, this book is for you; otherwise, head elsewhere. If you need to learn the basics of photoshop for non-photography needs, or want to learn how to add layout and text to your projects, this book would suffice. For photographers who want to learn how to use photoshop to manage, edit and manipulate their SLR captured pictures, this ISN'T the book for you. The projects are drawn out, cumbersome and uninspiring. Topics such as layers and masks aren't covered until 2/3 through the book! I would recommend the How to Wow series over this book - How to Wow is conscience, informative and conveys information quickly vs. the verbose manner which Deke seems to favor....."
1,Not pleased,"I ordered two poseys with the intention of using the to display my Holiday Cards. The posey can realistically hold 4 cards each. I tried to return them and you need a return authorization number for which you have to call or email the company. Nobody got back to me, so I called again. I did get my RA number, but by this time it was past the 30 days that you have to return your product. So now, I will have a credit to the store that I have no interest in buying anything else from."
3,my voice sounds electronic,"According to people on the other end of the line, my voice sounds horrible when I use speakerphone - it sounds like I'm a robot. Other than that, the phone works fine, but I bought it for the speakerphone."
3,Expired Product,"I was going to use this today and after reading all the directions, I noticed that the expiration date is 6/8/11. They sent me and expired bottle. I will try and use this but if it doesn't work I'll be sending it back. I thought it was illegal to sell expired products!!Seller seems deceptive to me."
5,Works great as a DIY backyard mosquito spray,"I used this 10% solution diluted in my 32oz Ortho Dial-n-spray to get the perfect 4-6 week yard spray for mosquitoes in my yard. I used to be able to buy a Permethrin based spray at Menards, but they stopped selling it. The alternatives just don't work as well or as long.This concentration diluted in my hose sprayer to the same concentration works great and keeps my backyard very livable all summer (a few applications every 4-6 weeks).I wrote up the mix concentration and instructions on how easily do it on a blog post at:[...]Essentially use 2.5 ounces of this 10% Permethrin solution (this stuff), fill the 32oz. dial-n-spray (or any other 32oz hose sprayer) with water, and set the delivery rate on the dial-n-spray hose sprayer to 2oz/gallon of water. Then spray your yard area. This mix covers about 5,000 square feet of yard very nicely. It only takes about 15 minutes to do my backyard."
1,Does not work on ticks,"We are suffering from a brown dog tick infestation like we have never seen before. Permethrin 10% was recommended to control these little devils. I used it at the rate of 7 oz per gallon of water and could see NO results. I tried an experiment by setting up one container with fabric in the bottom that was wet with the insecticide. I set up a second container with fabric that we heavily dosed with the Permethrin and then allowed to dry. Ticks dropped into the container with the wet fabric died within 24 hours. Ticks dropped into the container with the fabric that had been allowed to dry out never died. There does not appear to be any ""28-day residual effect"" with this product as claimed in ""Product Description"". I do not recommend this product for control of ticks."
4,Very effective for killing flies - be sure to dilute!,"This product is VERY effective. I used it to get rid of flies in my back yard, when nothing else worked. I used about 1 cup of the product in a hose-sprayer attachment (it mixes water with the product as it disburses) and sprayed it onto my lawn. When I first sprayed it onto our lawn, we had hundreds (maybe thousands?) of flies buzzing around the yard. (Evidently, the sod in our yard had fly eggs in it and they hatched when spring hit). About a week after the initial application, I sprayed again. Now, instead of thousands - we only have 2 or 3 pesky flies.I highly recommend this product for severe insect problems (yes, even flies!) However, be SURE to dilute it with water and be warned: this stuff smells REALLY strong."
1,sold off brand for durvet,"I bought a durvet product, and was shipped a martin's product that sells for 1/3 of the cost of the durvet product."
1,Poor Customer Service,No people skills. This company was unwilling to resolve a shipping issue with the item.
3,didn't work for our tick problem,"we used the entire bottle on half an acre, but it did not seem to do anything. there is a tick infestation in our area, and nothing seems to be helping. this product is no exception. after about 10 different products, we tried sevin which attaches to the water hose, and it seemed to get the job done."
2,about the scanned-OCR-edition,"I would like to write about the text of the paperback, not on the content: this is an edition of GeneralBooks who scanned the original book (that is available in pdf for the buyers - fortunately), passed it through OCR, and printed what came out. NO checking and NO formatting was done on the text. Even the exising formatting is often missing (footnotes follow mostly continously in the same row (!) the text of one-one page), titles may miss on the beginning of chapters, one part of the content disappeared (I am not even aware of OCR to do that!). Without the original scanned book, it is impossible to read. I wonder how much it would have added to the present price to just check for formatting and separating text from footnotes, nothing more. As it is now, I would not recommend it at all, but only to buy the pdf, and print it out at home. The present state of the book is simply inacceptable."
5,The best cookbook a Dad will ever need!,"From the main dishes to the desserts, this book has everything a Dad, or anyone else, needs to put together a great meal. Great pictures and easy recipes to follow. Buy it."
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD with lots of latin tunes that can really get a party going. I love the Maria Maria remix and also, the STOP! remix of Crazy. The latin tunes like Mucho Mambo make it a really great CD for a hot summer party. I like the CD and think that anyone who is looking for a pumping party mix should pick this one up."
5,One of my favorite icons of the eighties!,"A no mainstream entertainment with interesting and fine dialogues gives as result a fascinating portrait of those eighties. Atmospheric drama around the banality, frivolity and nave domain of the life 's theory in this captivating story around a classic triangle affair.All the cast was splendid: From the disturbed Genevieve Bujold, the easy going life of Leslie Ann Warren and the mysterious and elusive male character played by Keith Carradine.I must acknowledge that Alan Rudolph made me think he would climb the highest peaks after The Moderns, but evidently, something happened on the road."
4,whither the US market?,"Giaglis gives a systematic study of mobile businesses that currently exist in major countries. Of these, the vast majority involve the use of cellphones. The key issue is what makes some applications successful and others not? On such answers are millions of euros, yen or dollars bet.Perhaps the biggest question mark is the US market. The largest single national market in the world, as measured in US dollars. (Though the Chinese cellphone market now has more users, their revenue is much less.) In the US, will applications successful in Japan, Korea or Europe also succeed? It's a little frustrating that he does not discuss this to greater extent."
1,If they're were negative starts I would give it,"I have to say that this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. There is no plot, it is very boring, besides that, it finishes too fast. It's not even like a real movie. I saw it with my friend, and she totally agrees, she thinks it's the worst too. It does provide some entertainment......laughing at how dumb this movie is. The special effects are horrible, don't see it, it's not worth your time."
2,gimmie a break,i watched this show just a little bit didnt really like it i think she is just a loud mouth person with a really bad cast i think this show wasnt a good one but i guess others would have their opinions too
3,Gimme A Break,I love Nell Carter and this is a good purchase good Show Nell Carter is a great Broadway Stage Actress She won a Tony Award for Ain't Misbehavin Nelly ruth is Missed!
5,Starring Nell Carter!!!,"We all know that this is hands-down one of the BEST shows ever on TV; bring on seasons 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (I think it went to 6)! The only thing that upsets me is that the description lists Kari Michaelson and Laura Jill Miller as the ""stars"" of the show. It should simply say ""Starring Nell Carter."" Period. She's the star of the show and it's disappointing that she wouldn't get that recognition."
1,Great show..defective discs.,"I have a well functioning, high end DVD player/recorder. I play all sorts of different recorded and store bought DVDs and have NO problems. I ordered this set and had to get a replacement set. The replacement set had the exact same problems. There was digtal break up right at the FBI warning. The disc would turn off after the end of an episode, if you could get it to work to begin with. It sent my DVD player into fits. This has never happened with any other discs from other movies and shows before and works great with anything but, Gimme a Break. I'm glad other people seem to be able to enjoy there set and wish i was one of them."
4,What happened to my piece of the cake? You ate it Nell.,I grew up loving this show and the thing about buying them so many years later is remembering the good times. I didn't realize how sad the first season was. It definitely got funnier as the years went on.
5,Superb introduction to his early career,"This album charts John Martyn's progress from unreconstructed folkie to his jazz fringed arrangements. His guitar work, which drifts into the background in his later work, is beautifully exposed. His echoplex work is some of the most haunting you will hear. Well worth purchasing."
3,Its okay,"I like his old stuff better. The old stuff on this anthology i already had, and his new stuff is a bit weird and not soothing at all like his earlier stuff."
1,Great Gatsby,"I have yet to receive this purchase. I find this to be unacceptable. I purchased it over a month ago, and no longer need the book for my class has already read it in its entirety."
2,racist reality not confronted,"I totally agree with the last comment. A lot of you gave this book five stars because you feel ""minorities"" are acting paranoid, acting out. You're thinking, i've never had a racist thought in my life! Never called anybody names! My people give other peoples freedom, gives them jobs, saves their souls, and do nice things like correcting their English. if you say that, then chances are you don't have any close friends who are not ""White."" If you say you do, then they probably act and speak like you. It's time for American writers to start talking about racial conflict in this divided nation openly, instead of pumping out these passive-agressive texts using political correct language. Thumbs down to Schlesinger's one-sided book."
1,"Practice What You Preach, Mr Schlesinger","This book is well written and underlines the dangers of a society in which the cement of society is so fractured that everyone feels entitled to act without regard to a social norm. However, Mr. Schlesinger is hardly the man to trust on such matters. His standards of proper behavior depend solely on one's political allegiance. He has argued on the one hand that a black man is not entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court because of allegations that the man made a dirty joke (never mind that his accuser had serious credibility problems). Then he turns around and defends Bill Clinton against (much more credible) allegations of rape by arguing that ""gentlemen always lie about sex."" The only problem with multiculturalism is its potential for creating a nation where no one can agree on what is right and what is wrong. Mr. Schlesinger, it seems, cannot even agree on such matters in his own mind."
5,brilliant and perfect timing,it's brilliant and perfect timing. I highly recommend it to everyone in US who is really interested in preserving US democracy.
2,There are just so many other books I would rather read,"I had to read this book for a history class. I can't think of one possible reason why this book should be required for a college course. It is basically one main idea repeated over and over again with little historical evidence. This is a book that should be required instead for sociology courses.Plus this book could basically be written by anyone. Most of the ideas found in it are common sense.I am bias, however, as I fear multiculturalism as it will only make students less educated. People hardly know American history, I can't imagine them having the time to study multiple histories of other countries.I do agree with the author, however, that history should be honest. Good luck with that!"
5,Good Techno,This is the mucic they used in the movie Basic Insitnct in the scene where they are dancing in the night club that looked like a church. Very good early 90's dance/techno music. Have been searching for this cd for about 3 years.
2,you get what you pay for,I bought 3 sets of these towels. After the second washing all three sets began to shed threads. After a month there were numerous threads hanging from the towels and the hems unraveled. The towels work fine but the appearance is really cheap.
2,Nice towels...Poor wash cloths,"The bath towels are great...good size, quality weight, expected color. HOWEVER, the wash cloths, while of quality weight, are a different shade in color and simply stitched around the edges...really do NOT 'go' with the Bath Towels...nor do they match the Rattan Martex Egyptian hand towels...AND the Hand towels do not match in color the Bath towels or washcloths!!! The hand towels are of inferior weight...All in all, If you want MATCHING Bath Towels, Wash Cloths and Hand Towels, DO NOT order these!!!"
3,"Good, but not great.","I have had these sets for a year and a half and I really loved the way that these towels felt when I got them. They are thick, plush and oversized. Just the kind of towels that I like. However the wash cloths are another story. They are of a lesser quality. They are not quite as thick and the towels and they look cheap. I can handle that, but they also have one major problem. They hold stains. My husband plays football and he sometimes gets filthy. I have tried all kind of treatments with these washcloths and they still will not look totally clean and that is just gross. I could ignore this if it was anything other than dirt that stained them. These are the only washcloths that I own that have done that. To put the icing on the cake, they are getting frayed at the edges. All of this while the towels still look practically new. Basically, you can count on a quality towel and a substandard washcloth that you will have to be very careful with."
2,Got it in damaged condition.,"I received this product and as a new student looking forward to learn this guitar, I kept it untouched till my guitar classes start. The very first day I took my guitar to the instructor to tune it up and he said that the guitar is broken and is no good. Had already passed a month after my purchase so couldn't return it back. So cant really say how the actual guitar is. Please get ur guitar checked asap if ur new to this instrument."
1,Don't buy,"This guitar i bought thinking that it would be good for the price BUT, the action was way to high the neck was 1/2 way snapped and it is just not worth the money you would pay for it!!"
4,Great guitar for starter,Full Size Acoustic Guitar with Free Carrying Bag - Natural.I received Guitar as expacted.
1,defective,"I should've listened to the reviews before buying this guitar. They shipped me the guitar with a two-inch crack near the nut, and the paint was chipped in several other places. I would have shipped this one off for a replacement, but since they told me that I have to be the one who pays for the return shipping (which is bull), I didn't. I wouldn't buy from this seller again..."
1,Defective,"The guitar was defective. It has the low E string further away than the low A string, while the low D string is too close to the low A string. Also at one side of the guitar at the bottom edge, it is chipped in some parts."
1,Very poor quality,"This is a very poor quality guitar, and I am extremely disappointed with my purchase.Problems:1) Extremely high action on the strings.2) Visible crack in the joint between guitar neck and body.3) Cheap adhesive sticker used to decorate the sound hole prone to peeling.4) Bridge has significant lifting at rear."
1,"Can you give me a bucket, so i can hold a tune?","I bought this guitar a couple of days ago, and i thought it was going to be an alright guitar. I read a couple of good reviews and then i bought it. It came in the mail and i tightened up the strings. The guitar couldn't stay in tune. I have returned it and have bought a different guitar. to all future buyers - DON'T BUY THIS GUITAR!"
1,"Not good, even for a beginner.","I bought this guitar about a month ago, trying to stay cheap until I learned how to play. It makes it impossible to learn. The strings that were attached were old strings, although it does come with a set of new ones if you want to change them. The strings are extremely far from the fret board, which makes it almost impossible for someone who is trying to learn to play it. I pick this one up and struggle holding the strings down and switching between chords, but I pick up my friend's and it is so much easier. It doesn't stay in tune, which is like the worst thing imaginable for a guitar, especially if you are learning and aren't good at tuning. I even have a friend who is amazing at guitar and can tune them easily say that this one is almost impossible to tune correctly.All in all, unless you are great at guitar and just want a cheap one, then avoid buying this. It would be more worth your money to spend about $50 extra on a somewhat nicer one."
1,This is a beginners guitar,"I know that this is on a $60.00 guitar, but for the money you could do betterI tried to tune it and the bridge broke, however the they are refunding my money. Custome service is great...professional and satisfying"
1,Not Very Happy.,"I bought this guitar and all seemed fine at first. I now find alot of things wrong with it now. The neck is out of whack and I just had it readjusted, but I was told that it is on borrowed time before it goes again. Plus I find the neck was broken and repaired and that to is shakey. I should have spent a few dollars more and got a better one. For those looking to buy a guitar that is inexpensive please look at another not this one."
1,Damaged Goods,"I purchased this guitar for my daughter. First, the one that shipped was blue, not natural color. She was just beginning to learn the guitar, and never got it to sound right. Finally, she took it into a music store, and found out that someone had unsuccessfully tried to repair the guitar. Do not buy from these frauds!"
1,Do not buy at any cost!!!,"I bought this guitar after reading all the good reviews posted in amazon.However when I bought it, the product that was obtained (excluding the defective bag and strap which is known) was a cheap useless product.It took more than 30 minutes for my teacher to tune it and he recommended me to immediately ship it back.It was a low quality product with wood that was so soft it could crack any time and the cheapest strings available. Also during tuning one of the plucks below came out and just did not go inside again.The service obtained from Austin Bazaar was also not upto the mark.Not only did I have to fund the shipping on my own but it also took time and constant e-mailing to get my refund back.All the time, cost and effort to buy and refund it together was equal to the amount in which I could have bought a new guitar.This is just a device to fool begineers like me and I now seriously believe that people might be paid to write good reviews of the product."
3,Outdated History,The book is way out of date. Good information but highly dated and irrevelent to todays Montana. History is somewhat interesting but very dark. Disaster after disaster.
4,Used in a college sociology class,"The book written by Goldthorpe entails a good educational experience through modern day societies. Written in great detail and thought, the author has chosen a format which is easy to follow. However the book itself is a challenging subject and arouses many questions that should be asked about the society of today."
5,Love it!,"OPI makes great nail lacquer. Period. They are my go to company every time. I wish I could get them to keep some of the colors longer than seasonal, but I guess being forced to review and update isn't a bad thing."
3,Great starter mac or media server,"The generation 1 mac mini is a great starter mac. I upgraded mine to 1GB at CompUSA and use it, along with an 160GB external drive, as my main media server. I have almost completed the process of importing all my CDs and some movies into iTunes. Importing video from a digital camcorder is quite easy with iLife but the G4 CPU is not up to the task for quick video editing. The newer Intel Core Duo mac mini should handle this easlity though."
4,"Great for Apple entrants, but lifetime is about 3 years","This was my first Apple computer. And for what I needed it for (economy of space, playing music, videos and general surfing and downloading) it was excellent.However, after 3 years the hard drive packed up (no reason, no excessive use, it just did) - luckily it packed up in a way that made it possible to save the data. AND I had bought Applecare, Apple's very own extended warranty, so getting a new logic board and hard drive was free! Had I not bought the cover (some $80 dollars) I would have forked out $350 just to get it fixed, plus parts and labour.A good machine for casual users. If you're hardcore and need lots of RAM and Disc space, get a maxed out iMac or a Power Mac."
1,OLD STOCK,They sell old stock items which may have old software. I called Apple to register this and they told me Amazon should have NOT sold this. Apple only sells items within 90 days and this product was over 4 months.
5,"Ephesians, A book for today",This was interesting and extremely helpful as a Bible study guide and reference for the study. It is laid out in an easy to read format with numerous helpful questions that stimulate the group and deepen the study.
2,Different artists!,"This CD set does NOT feature the original artists! Keep that in mind. It's kind of a tribute album if you will....Some tunes are done real well, while others are not too pleasurable. However, it's not too bad."
3,This is something just a little different.,"The villians are evil doers that you will hiss at, the goodies you will root for and along the way you will enjoy this over the top comedy. Buster Keaton plays the role to William, he is one of the heroes of the storyline. This is great fun to watch as the characters whisper to the camera and you are encouraged to hiss and clap along. If you like panto you are going to really enjoy this movie. It is certainly not your average film."
2,Stop pursuing her,"This is an unusual film in that all of the actors are performing as if amateurs, spouting their lines in silly voices and waving their hands as they emote. The formula is amusing for about 20 minutes and then becomes exceedingly tiresome. Buster Keaton was inserted into the film, no doubt, to generate sales, but he has little to do. I laughed twice throughout the movie and spent the rest of the time trying to stay awake. At one point, the film descended to pies in the face humor (one recipient being Vernon Dent, the Three Stooges' foil for many years).Some highlites: Alan Mowbray was perfectly cast as the villain; Anita Louise was lovely; and Margaret Hamilton sings! Beyond that, there is nothing positive to say about this dud. The quality of the DVD was acceptable, if just barely."
3,MISLEAD,The pictorial representation of this product on Amazon.com shows the original Canon product. What I received was a compatible product which based on previous experience with using compatible products in my Canon printer cost me a printhead replacement. The supplier claims that the misinformation was caused by Amazon's replacement of the compatible's image by their own original picture. The supplier was surprised by the sudden increase in sales volume of the item and upon my complaint realized that it was because of the product misrepresentation. I see that the situation still is unchanged even after my feedback.
1,Not recommended.,"Very flimsy made in China and tiny...can't possibly hold 50 lbs. Perhaps all five together lined up it may. Anyways, much smaller than expected. This is something you see often at local ninety-nine cents stores. Very disappointed."
2,What the heck??,"What does ""product weighs 50 lbs."" mean? Five hooks, 10 lbs. each?? Really? What size are the actual hooks? There are so many products that have totally inadequate descriptions!"
3,Old book with new cover,"This book was a classic when published in 1988. This edition is a re-issue with a new publisher without a single word revised. A lot has changed in the national security landscape in the last fourteen years. Indeed, Snow has subsequently published four iterations of National Security with another publisher. Don't spend the money for this ""new"" edition!"
1,disapointing,Very disapointed in this video I expected some quirky but fun ukulele players but the people in this went from strange to obnoxious to kinda creepy and most lacked any kind of talent the only thing more disapointing than this video was the fact that holly hunter narrated it she didn't do a bad job but I think less of her for even being involved in something as poorly done as this
3,Not worth the time. Cornwell has done better,"Wow. I expected better. Is it Cornwell or his wife that just doesn't get us to that place we have come to expect from Cornwell. Trite might be a description. Forgetable is probably what I am going to be left with on this one.The period is one of my favorites, it is the dawn of the regency era, when the terror is taking over France. Great we have seen this in before in such works as Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities, and in the Scarlett Pimpernel.With those classic examples, Cornwell should know that he has do as well as they, or better. He doesn't. We have a little princess of a heroine whose backbone is forced upon us. We have a transparent villian, and we have a hero who really shines as hero only through the mist colored eyes of a romance novel. So what is a novel from one of the premier historical novelists is rally a romance with a thin veneer of historical laced on it.Better has been done elsewhere. Can be skipped."
4,The first sociopath does not have a chance.,"The book has many twists and turns with lots of disingenuous people. I enjoyed reading and trying to guess who was good and who was bad. I purchased the book because it is set with the French Revolution as a backdrop. I was hoping for one of Bernard Cornwell's historical notes about the Revolution, but, alas, none was to be found. Otherwise the book was excellent."
2,Too much schmaltz and not enough history,"I'm half way through this and probably won't finish it. It's a love story more than a historical novel. A bit of insights into the class system in England in the era of the French Revolution, but not much else in the way of history. Not a real Cornwell novel by any means. Not a bad story, mind you, but not what I was expecting."
2,The Fallen Angels,"I'm a big fan of Cornwall's , and his many books, This isn't one of them, What it is a slushy historical novel that is more in keeping with drug store romance stuff. That bit about the gypsy love affair for that period of history was too much for me. The predudice of the time made that just impossible.No matter how big a shovel they used to cover this fact up it was just too big mound."
4,Great Read,I couldn't put this book down! It was great! I classify it as spy novel with a romance interest. Loved it! Am disappointed to see Cornwell and Kells have not continued to write books together.
5,Master of the word,"I love the way Bernard Cornwell plays with history in his books. His story telling keeps me glued to the book until the end. Then, I look for more of his books."
4,GB's Review,"A favorite author, Cornwell did not disappoint. Excellent story material ... excellent history blended with action. Good character development.gb"
5,like an old friend,"I started headbanging in 1972. Shortly after that, I heard this ablum. These guys are truly masters of metal. After 25 years, I still live it. What it is, is RAW METAL TO THE CORE. It will steal your soul. It is timeless. The only other metal album from that era that's comparable is Iggy and the Stooges RAW POWER. If you love metal, you have to BUY THIS CD!!! 5 star for sure."
4,holds up better than most sabbeth discs!,I saw this band at the Action House and Rockpile on Long Island many years ago and bought both Lps. I played them till they wore out smooth. The disc sounds great. They should get together again and play a few gigs on the Island and Brooklyn. I would love to see em again. Maybe they could finaaly make a few bucks!
5,"totally awesome, dude!!!!!!!!!","This album totally rocks, man!! I'm sure that many bands (Led Zep, AC/DC, etc.) have copied the pure energy sound of this great band.I especially dig the groove of bassist Gary Justin - the dude makes his guitar pulse with life!"
2,"Hard rock with no apologies, but....","Like another poster, I bought Kingdom Come from a dime store cut-out bin in the mid-70s. Instrumentally, the band had some exciting moments, but drummer John Garner's vocals are hard for me to bear. Just imagine an entire album in which the vocalist screams and shrieks throughout every song -- it is an assault on the ears that simply wears you down. I always believed that SLB could have been more successful if they had added a real singer instead of relying on a screaming banshee! [My apologies to Garner, who was kind enough to post a message on this board.]"
1,No solution.,Not worth the plastic it is made of. Save your money...didnt' even work once right out of the box.
5,Love these guys,I am hooked completely. Do I need to say more? If you haven't watched this series...do so. You won't be sorry.
3,Needs Captioning,"This series is always enjoyable, even as reruns, so it was purchased as a birthday gift for a senior with hearing loss. It was disappointing in that she can enjoy the action but not follow the dialog as well as she would have if the DVD had closed captioning avalaible."
3,Midsomer Murders,This is a nice little series that does not get old. There is always something new to find at each viewing. Detective Barnaby and his sidekick Sgt Troy have a nice chemistry which makes them a good team for their investigations as Barnaby is teaching Troy the crust of being a detective.
5,"Midsomer Murders, Set Three","Love, love, love this whole series. I am buying them one by one. Can't wait to buy more."
5,Great!,I loved the first two sets and now I love the third as well. The mysteries are intriging without being overdone. I love the settings and the details. Always good to watch.
4,Midsomer County a positive nest of murderers,Genial and often gentle murder and John Nettles' handling of suspects and witnesses is so polite it's a pleasure to watch.
4,Great Album,"I've listened to this album plenty of times now. Its a pretty strong release from the duo here. obviously uncommon valor is beyond the highlight of this album. I really like jedi mind tricks beats some other highlights on the album:Put em in the grave, serenity in murder, heavy metal kings, shadow business, black winter day.Jedi mind tricks generally rap about things that actually important in life. sit back and listen closely. enjoy."
5,GREAT CD!,"This is a really great CD by Jedi Mind Tricks, it's one of their best! I highly recommend ""Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell"" for anyone who needs to pickup some new rap music for their collection."
2,Too Perky,"I just thought it was worth mentioning that the instructor for this DVD, ""Ms. Teresa,"" is one of those super-perky people with a serious child-woman vibe going on. My partner and I literally could not be in the same room as my children while it was playing, her demeanor was too nails-on-a-blackboard for us. Yes, my kids didn't seem to mind but I'd really like to find a DVD that we can watch together. Or at least one that doesn't make me cringe."
2,"I hate to say it, but this is book is awful!!","This was was very difficult to get into!!! The first 100 pages was a struggle. I feel F.M. Busby had good intentions to where he was trying to lead you to with this novel but I feel he not a great story teller at all. I read his previous novel Arrow from Earth which was fairly desent but this book had so much scientific gadets, lingo & mumbo jumbo that it was so easy to get lost!! The main character Sam Gowdy was plain and I didn't care too much for him. F.M. Busby needs alot of work on character development. There were some concepts & ideas were good that's why I gave this book a 2 but I would never recommend anyone this book to read for entertainment!!"
4,Good Book!,"Part of the seriers of Desert Rouges, and I have found this one just has entertaining as the others. I do like this author, the books are well written."
3,From Back Cover,"""I'M WHAT...?""No, not pregnant, thank heavens. Emma would have known that. But married? Well, if the man standing before her - the very love of her college life - was to be believed, she was. And suddenly he was claiming to be a desert prince, too. Sure, they'd had a 'pretend' ceremony and honeymoon in the Caribbean. But it was pretend, wasn't it?Prince Reyhan claimed his father, the king, had decided it was time for him to marry. There was just one little glitch - Reyhan was already married. So, the king ordered Reyhan's wife - Emma - to a two-week trip to paradise before he would grant a royal annulment. But wasn't paradise the perfect place for love?7th in the Desert Rogues series"
5,end times,"It was like all Calvary chapel products, new, good condition, and there is no one to compare to Pastor Chuck I look forward to next years DVD and the changes ahead."
3,"Good, but not great. Dahl's better.","I'm a big fan of Roald Dahl (his adult short stories, especially) and Dahl is what led me to this collection by John Collier. I liked it, but wasn't as bowled over as some of the other reviewers here. Dahl is a superior writer, with more imagination and wit. But if you're able to get your hands on a copy of this book -- I got mine at a used book store -- don't miss ""The Chaser,"" an utterly fantastic short short that was made into a Twilight Zone episode of the same name."
2,I'm also reaching for my revolver!,"If you like this song ""Thats when I reach for my Revolver"", do yourself a favor and look up a band called Mission of Burma. The only difference between the two recordings is Mobys version has a better sound quality which would be expected because the original is pretty old. The other things I noticed off hand would be Mobys insignificant guitar work throughout. The overdub guitars at the end is just all out of place in the mix and it adds nothing to the song. Imagine having the ego of a really good guitarist but not actually being good..Honestly I think Moby is incredibly overated and any kid with a little creativity/pop sensibility who might be considered an intermediate guitarist armed with some acid loops could probably make music comprobable to whatever he does. Add some flimsy lyrics with a weak vocal approach and there you have it, another corporate shill born at the capitalist gang bang! YAY!!!"
1,This was a mistake!!,"If you are looking for the original ""I like to move it"" from Madagascar, do not purchase this album - it is a hokey knock-off and the rest of the songs are just as bad - way too hip-hop and trashy."
5,"Excellent - vast, yet substantive compendium!","As Albert H. Teich writes in his Preface, his ""selections are -- by design -- a mixed bag"" and that ""readers will love some and hate others, find some fascinating, others tedious."" This ""book reflects what I hope is a balanced view of the important issues in the field of technology and society."" Well, I wholeheartedly agree that this edition has met its objectives! A+++ Many thanks to Mr. Teich for his brilliant presentation of vast, yet substantive collection of articles. Technology and the Future offers readers the opportunity to apply critical thinking. Great work - I'll be reaching out to the resources offered as well."
5,great battery..,"I was a little shy about getting a clone... I bought 1 battery and a charger to try out. The camera does not know the deference, it has about the same operating time as the original, for a fraction of the cost. I'm getting ready to go a vacation, so I've bought 4 more."
3,The Present,"I am a big fan of the Molory family, and I like this book, but I expected a great romance. It was ok but not what I expected. I really can't wait to read about Jermey or even more of the Anderson brothers. The present is a good read not great, will do untill Jermey."
3,"The Present, A Mallory Holiday Novel",The Mallory Clan has become one of my favorite families. The latest entry The Present is a quick look into the beginnings of the whole wonderful saga. All my favorite characters and more are in this story. It is a quick read that is entertaining and a must read for any fan of the Mallorys. Where will Ms. Lindsey take us from here? I don't know but I can't wait until the next chapter is on the shelves. The Present has me re-reading the whole series.
3,"Slow, slow, slow","In the end, the book proved enjoyable. But it was slow to start and bit boring. It assumed that you were addicted to the Mallory family, that you had read all the previous books about them, and that just the subject of the Mallory family was enough to compel you to read the entire book.The Present is a simple, brainless read, enjoyable, but not exciting or moving."
4,The Present,"I enjoyed this extremely the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it was just to short. I love the whole series about the Mallory's. In this book it lets you see that older brother is truly one of the Mallory's, full of passion and love. The tale about the first of the line of Mallory's was great.It explained where some of them recieved their traits from.I hope that in the near future there is more about them. It is a big family. I just hope there is more story to love. I would recommand this to everyone. It is a great book on it's own.But I think you would be crazy to not read the whole series."
5,IN LINE WITH THE MALORY TRADITION - HARD TO PUT DOWN !!,"JOHANNA LINDSEY HAS SEVERAL ""MALORY"" NOVELS AND THEY ARE ALL WONDERFUL. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BY ""THE PRESENT"". JOHANNA LINDSEY MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE A PART OF THE ""MALORY CLAN"". THE CHARACTERS JUMP OUT THE PAGES AND ARE SO REAL."
4,Another Malory Keeper!,"I love all the Malory novels (Gentle Rogue my absolute favorite!) and while The Present didn't have as much excitement as previous Lindsey novels, I enjoyed it and I laughed out loud as always when James and Anthony are together. For those Malory and/or Lindsey fans out there - this is a keeper. Now, Ms. Lindsey, I'm wondering how you will write a story about Jeremy that will top the one about his father and uncle . . ."
4,Another great read from Johanna Lindsey!,"This tale continued the Malory story. It was great. It tied in all of the characters in a heart warming fashion. If you love Johanna Lindsey, you will love this book!"
1,Not up to the usual JL standard,"The first Johanna Lindsey book that I did not like. I have ready other novels involving the Mallory family, and enjoyed them. This book was confusing. There wasn't much romance. It was like a whose who of the Mallory family. Most folks have family trees about the size of an oak. The Mallory family is like a REDWOOD! And JL explores every damn twig of that Redwood! If you really want a great JL read, try ""You Belong to Me"", ""Angel,"" or ""Love Me Forever""."
2,Where's Johanna?,"Where did she go? I'm sorry. I usually find a Johanna Lindsey book an excellent read. I love her Malory novels and continually re-read those I have. There are very few Johanna Lindsey stories I have not enjoyed, and The Present was one that just didn't fit the bill. It didn't read like it was written by Johanna. Did she get kidnapped by gypsies and someone else write this book in her stead?"
5,A Christmas gift!,"If you are a fan of Johanna Lindsey you will enjoy her special edition, I did when it came out years ago! I still remember it with fondness. A pleasant if not scintillating read. And I mean that the latter is lacking, still quite charming."
2,Disappointing!,I love the Malory series but found this one lacking all the passion I've come to expect from the Malorys. A nice story...but check it out from the library.
3,"Parts were fun, but it's my least favorite in the series.","I love to read about the Malory family. And I think some of the underlying story lines were good as well as the main storyline. However, the book was too short to develope the stories as well as all of the others in the series. It seemed too rushed. But it's still my favorite series of books."
2,A disappointing prequel to a great family!,"I love Johanna Lindsey but I was very disappointed with this book. For one it was to short and not enough time was spent with character development. The characters met, fell in love got married in what seemed like 20 pages. Definetly not this author's best effort especially since her fan's have to wait a year for a new book."
5,A wonderful & warm story,"If you've ever read any of Johanna Lindsey's books featuring the Malory family, you HAVE to read this one! If you've never read any of them, you HAVE to read this one! It truly is a ""Present"". With humor & warmth, the Malory family holiday story is a great way to start your holiday season."
2,If you like the Malory's then you will be disapointed.,"Well I have read many of Lindsey's books, i haven't liked all of them, but they usually were entertaining. However The Present was just a shallow story when it could have been much more if the auther had done the work. Its story has unforfiled promise. When i first got the book the first thing i noted was how thin it was, when i flipped to the back to see how many pages it was i saw that the last 20 or so pages were about other books Lindsey had written, i felt cheated that this story would be even shorter then i thought.Well about the story, if your looking for a nice romantic read with a story to sigh over then this isn't the book for you. But if you are like me and had to have this book because its about the Malory's then go ahead, nothing i write will stop you, but be prepared for disapointment. The one good thing about this book is that it had a nice theme running through it with Jason and James."
2,yawn!!!!,"This book was a complete waste of time. For a person who's been reading Johanna Lindseys' books for years and eagerly awaiting each and every one, I must say that this was a great disappointment. There was too much 'going back and rehashing' each Mallory romance. Was it either written for old 'Mallory' fans (in which case you didn't really need to rehash each couple's romance) or was it written for new people (in which case the rehash would have been totally confusing and irrelevant)? And the story of Christopher and Anastasia was boring. There was nothing new or exciting in this book and it was thoroughly predictable. I was very disappointed."
1,Disappointed...,"I'm quite disappointed in the last two Malory novels (The Present and Say You Love Me). The hero and heroine don't get as much space in the novel because Lindsey is so busy trying to tell about all the Malorys. I'm so disappointed. I loved the first four Malory books. Even though I would love to read more books on the Malorys, I still would rather have quality, not quantity. Lindsey, please develop the hero and heroine more and spend less time trying to bring back the other Malorys. Just a brief mention is enough to make us smile in memory. I felt so junk after reading The Present and Say You Love Me. Please don't ruin other Malory characters in your future books. Remember: quality, not quantity."
1,worst book i ever read! it made no sense at all.,"i have to say that i am very disappointed in ms. lindsey. i've been a fan of hers for a lot of years now. and of all her books this has to be the worst. the present: a mallory holiday novel, in my opinion was a huge waist of time and anticipation."
3,Nice and spicy,This book of ms. lindsey is really Enlightening...to the fact that this is about the ancestors of the lovable Malory clan. Although i like this a little bit less than the other Malory series. I just can't wait for the next installment and i hope this time it is going to be Jeremy's turn to find love !!!
4,I thought this book was a great ending....,I thought this book was a great ending for the Malory Brothers and a great beginning for their children. I have read all of the Malory books and I have to say I am partial to James and George. I hope that Ms. Lindsey will continue writing about this intriguing family. I would like to see how the brothers handle their daughters and the men in their lives.
3,A cute light Mallory read,"This is a cute light weight read for a true Mallory fan. It doesn't move the series foward much, but instead tells the love story of the gypsy grandmother hinted about in former Mallory books. This story is told in three parts. The first is the Regency mysterious Christmas delivery of a written account of the love story. The second is the past love story in the third person, and lastly how it effects the different members of the family. The story doesn't spend too much time on the first and third parts of the story. For that reason don't expect much movement foward in the regency period. Cute, but not a meaty, juicy read that she's known for. I look foward to more fully developed juicier Mallory books about the youngest mambers of the family barely introduced here!"
3,What was the plot???,"The Malorys are my favorite series out of several authors. However, after reading this, I stand by my feeling that Ms. Lindsey is losing her touch. This book was all over the place and really left musch to be desired. Jason has a mistress which produced a son who thinks his mother is a cold hearted bitter woman, and if you ask me, the son wasn't as upset as he should have been when he saw his real mom was still alive. It seemed all the characters just fell flat of previous novels depicting them. James, Tony, and Regina's husband (Nick) was getting a bit far fetched and made you wonder if they were ever really Rake Hells of London at any time. Even the suppose psychic in the family couldn't see the plots were just too many to keep up with and under developed?!Bottom line, this is about 3 books in one with none of the storylines living up to Malory standards or Johanna's for that matter but if ""Everyone Loves a Lindsey"", then it's for you."
2,Didn't finish it.... I hadn't done the pre-requisite reading,"I'm sure people will think I should have ""given it a chance"" and stuck with this book, but the first NINE CHAPTERS deal with members of a huge family who apparently have all had books written about them. Not only had I not read any of these previous books, but there were too many family members to keep straight. By the time I got to the journal (the ""present"" of the title), I really didn't care about any of these people OR their ancestors. Normally I love a series in which common characters pop up and are woven through the books, but this one was ridiculous! I guess if you've read ALL the previous Malory family stories, this would be the icing on the cake for you, but if you just pick up this book out of the blue... you'll be as lost as I was."
2,incorrect information on the back cover,The back cover of this book states a love affair with the second Marquis. Throughout the book it was hard to understand the generations with the wrong information printed on the back cover and the gaps in the first couple of generations of the family tree. Although the book was cute and charming it was a little boring. I usually can't put down a Johanna Lindsey book. Maybe it was rushed to get out in time for Christmas.
1,Not So Good,"Like everyone else who reviewed this book, I too, have read all the other books in the Malory series. Unlike everyone else, however, I was not as enthusiastic about this book. Granted every romance novel is little more than a canned formula, but it is the telling of the story that makes it worthwhile. This book was to short to have any interesting character development and the love story wasn't believable. It is a very quick read so if you do decide to read it and are disappointed as I was, you won't have wasted too much time!"
2,Lacking a strong storyline,"As an avid JL fan, 'The Present' was a distinct disappointment. The Malory clan have been delightful companions, but constant references to beloved characters of previous novels have made the last two offerings tedious at best. The passion and battle of wits that made me a fan in the first place were decidedly lacking. The novel started well enough, but I very quickly lost interest. Hopefully JL will be able to rekindle my interest with a steamy novel about Jeremy to conclude the Malory saga."
4,Malorys Rock,I'm a huge fan of the Malory novels and I wasn't disappointed with the Present. The only way this could have been better is if it would have been longer. I would have liked to know more details about the two main couples focused on in this book. But my main complaint with the Malory stories is that they end.
2,Something's Missing,"I was disappointed in this novel as a whole. I love the Malory series but this one had too many things going on at once, as well as terrible character development. The story of Christopher and Anna could have been so much better. It was very vague, I didn't get involved with the characters at all, and it's hard to believe the had a long and happy marriage after ""suddenly"" being in love when they barely spent an hour together."
3,Disappointing...,"After reading all the previous Malory stories, I found this one was very disappointing. While it was a nice story, it lacked all the passion that I've come to expect from the Malory family. If you've come to love the Malory characters as much as I do, you'd be better off just checking this one out from the library."
3,Good but not that good,"I was taken in by the 7.1 MP rating and the presence of a decent non-digital 10X optical zoom feature of the Fujifilm S700. It is an easy camera to learn how to operate and understand its functions, especially for a novice like me.I like the large LCD viewer. I am disappointed in the overall picture quality though, at even the very best settings. I have an entry level really cheap HP 3.1 MP digital camera with none of the features of the Fujifilm S700, which provides much sharper images.The only other real objection I have is the ""pop-up"" flash unit usually is held down by my fingers while snapping a shot, and I don't realize it until AFTER I take the shot. For the money though, it is an adequate digital camera and goes to remind one that you do indeed (only) get what you pay for."
5,"For 200 Bucks, It's a Steal","All of Fuji's digital cameras are excellent. This one is a steal considering how cheap it is and how many features it has. Only complaint, the refresh time is a little slow (it's been mentioned in other reviews) but other than that, this is an awesome, amazing, wondering camera."
5,Camera works great,"SO far so good, this camera takes great pictures. I havent taken a lot of out door pictures, but the ones I have taken turned out great."
4,money well spent,this has to be the best camera i've bought. the range of function are great.price was a really good deal also....
2,Would not recommend,This camera would work best on a tripod all the time. The flash overexposes the photos. I bought this oversized camera believing it would do a better job then the more compact digital cameras. I was wrong. The Sony cybershot outdoes this camera and is more compact and lighter to carry. This camera does a good job in low light without a flash. The flash heavily distorts the colors. I haven't found all the settings very helpful. You can pay half the price and get a more usable camera.
4,Great camera and I got it as referbished,"This is a great pre-DSLR camera, it is a point and shoot with a little more muscle and girth and great accessories, I don't have any yet but have been reading about them, hope to get a couple of lenses soon. I gave it only 4 stars because I have not tested/played with all the features but I am having fun doing so. I have added a few photos some of my gecko Gator I really enjoyed. I really recommend this camera and I hope to get a DSLR in a couple of years and hope this will help me get used to it.If anyone has any suggestions for me please leave a comment."
5,One Fantastic Camera,I bought this camera for my husband's birthday - he says it is the finest camera ever! It does everything it is advertised to do and more. The 10x Optical Zoom is just wonderful - brings things into focus which are impossible to get with the ordinary digital camera. The resolution on the pictures is really great. It is easy to use and easy to carry. A super great product say both the purchaser and the user.
3,Fujifilm finepix S700,"I purchased the camera based on the reviews of the camera and I wanted a camera with a zoom greater than 4x optical zoom. The 10x optical zoom has been great. I don't like the lense cap as it's constantly popping off and the on/off switch is right next to the zoom. Often times I meant to zoom and instead turned off the camera. I do like that it just takes regular double A batteries and I was able to use the memory card from my previous digital camera. Overall for the price, it's been a good camera."
4,Good camera just takes some getting used to,I would say this is a great camera. Only a few shots I could not get due to auto focusing issues at first but learned how to get past most of those problems.
3,I didn't like the lack of super CCD,"First of all, this S700 is not a bad camera. It does a lot for the money but before I bought this one I owned another finepix, the S5000 with Super CCD and the quality of the pictures are not comparable (even that S5000 it has only 3.1 Mega Pixels).Secondly, the body of the camera it doesn't feel ""solid"" but ""plastic"". So after a week of having this camera I decided to sell it and buy a Finepix S600Fd, what is a totally different product. My 2 cent advice is that with 100 dollars more (if you have) go for something that feels almost like a DSLR.check this link:Fujifilm Finepix S6000fd 6.3MP Digital Camera with 10.7x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom with Picture Stabilizationthis is a real incredible camera (S6000fd) for the price... one step before a DSLR!"
1,Not very good pics,"The camera has alot of nice features, but the pictures were not what we were expecting. The quality was subpar from the last camera we had, which was a finepix also. I would not recommend this to anyone. We are still trying to find a finepix that works though."
5,Fuji S700 7.1megapixel camera,"This camera can be described in two words, ""Simply Awesome!!"" For the money it's worth its weight in gold. It is very user friendly. If you've ever had a fuji camera in the past, you only have to read the manual in a limited fashion to use ALL of the functions. It takes wonderful, crisp, colorful pictures...in every setting imaginable. Also, it has a video recording function with sound to boot. If you're looking for a good camera, you'll really get the most bang for your buck with this one!"
5,Fujifil Finepix S700,This camera is awesome. Great pictures close up and far away. The best digital camera I have had. It is light weight and easy to carry.
4,"good product, good delivery","The order was sent in a timely manor and was in good working condition on arrival.I think this camera is awesome, but I'm keeping my old Canon EX Auto. I see the value of getting it serviced and back in use now."
4,on the verge of professional,pretty good. i like it. have taken some seriously awesome shots with it. i couldn't live with out it... that is fosho
1,Dosen't work at all.And customer support says they dont help customers with this camera!,I read the instruction manual for this digital camera.Cant get it to work! I called customer/technical support and was told by there tech help representitive they dont help there customers with camera products! I asked to speak to a supervisor.Left a voice mail message and never got a return phone call.I will never buy this product again! they stink! they told me to just keep reading the instruction manual untill i figure it out!
3,Camera Promotion not as it seems,The camera was great but the promotion to get the 1gb card with it was a complete disaster. There is no free memory card with this camera after about threee days of trying to get it out of amazon I quit trying.
1,throw it at the wall,"Noise, distortion, blurring, and not in any interesting way. No matter the settings, the light, the environment, the subject, the quality is disgraceful. I hate this miserable camera."
5,Enjoying my camera.,"Very happy with the purchasing process and satisfied with delivery. I am extremely delighted with this camera's capabilities. The picture quality surpassed my expectations. The user's manual provided me with a good understanding on how to operate camera. Since this was my first digital camera, I was grateful. I bought this camera for its manual features, but its automatic functioning proved to be very reliable for delivering exceptional picture quality. I'd like to thank Fujifilm for producing a quality product."
2,After 3 years the flash won't pop up,"I have enjoyed this camera. I consider the photo qualities to be excellent. I think the number of megapixels is just fine for general use.However, over the years, the flash has stopped popping up. You have to manually lift it and hold it with one finger to take flash pictures. In the future, I will avoid buying cameras with spring loaded pop up flash units."
3,Dirty Camera,"It was here the date it was supposed to! that i liked a lot.first thing, I noticed was how dirty the camera was! like dirty there was dirt things stuck to it. I know its a used camera but come on!Second, looks like some pixels are missing from the LCD screen, I think the screen was hit, that could have caused the dead pixels.Third, There was pictures in the camera.Fourth, the flash does not close all the way.But what else can you expect from a used item right?But all in all, I love the camera takes good pictures a lot of features."
1,faulty weak components,"The flash is made very flimsily. I have had this camera for a few years but use it rarely due to it being very bulky.With the way I cared for it and the little use it had, there is no reason that the flash ""pop-up"" mechanism should have failed. Without the flash completely opening, you get no flash at all. I have crammed a piece of paper in the camera to hold the flash open all the time. These cameras cost too much money for Fuji to have skimped on moving components.Check the internet. There are quite a few people who have had this issue with this camera."
5,Fuji S700 digital camera,I am totally pleased with my purchase of theFuji S700 digital camera ~ IT is everything Iwas hoping it would be. shipping was promptarrived in perfect condition.
4,Overall Good Value for the Money,"A great value for the money! The outdoors shots are amazingly crisp and well color-balanced. To me, image stabilization is adequate, even when fully zoomed and holding it by hand. However, I completely agree that this camera is really lacking in low-light situations. Unless I have a room-full of lights on (or sun shining in), the flash pictures are horribly grainy. The only other comment is the cube-like shape of the camera makes it difficult to just slip in your pocket. But I believe the quality is better than the other ""slim"" cameras on the market in this price range."
5,Love the ease of use and quality of pics,The camera works like a charm. We wanted something that took good quality photos with ease of shooting. This was the ticket. Can use this camera on automatic or manual settings.
4,Excellent Price/Value,"PROs: Accepts 46mm effects filtersCaptures good images on ""Auto"" settingCONs: Purple fringingShutter lagI got mine for just under $300. At the time, it was the best DSLR I could find in thatprice range that would accept standard lens filters.It consistently captures good images on the ""Auto"" setting. So, if you want to createabove average photo's, with point-n-shoot convenience and price, this is an excellent camera.I've had mine for two years and have produced some nice images with a little adjustmentto the ""tone curve"" and ""sharpness"" using Corel Photo-Paint 9. Paste the link belowinto your browser address bar to view some of my S700 photos on Google Earth andpanoramio.com:[...]"
3,"Good product, poor support.","Pros: Great camera overall - takes beautiful pics, good point-and-shoot function with plenty of manual adjustments available.Cons: Hope it doesn't break - Fuji's factory service is expensive!!! $85 to replace a sticking play button. Also a big camera that can be outperformed by most of the compact super-zooms available now."
3,Honeymoon Is Over :(,"At first, I loved this camera. Lots of detail, great color etc. Then I started noticing a ton of noise and artifacts in the indoor pictures, even at the best resolution with flash. Recently, I took flash pictures in a well lit auditorium, 10 feet from the stage of an Honors ceremony at my daughters school and the pictures were so grainy that peoples faces looked alsmost cartoony!. I have the ISO limited to max 400 and everything set to best quality (superfine, etc) If that's a problem, let me know??For now, I'll say that it's a great outdoor camera but stinks inside unless taking macro shots."
3,Great for MANUAL SHOOTING. Lousy in Auto mode or A/S.,"Excellent picture quality at close range, but if you zoom you get your choice of grainy or blurry if you are a shaky shooter like me. The Anti-Shake is just upping the ISO so the ""film"" is faster, not a true anti-shake and it gets grainy in all but the best lighting. Takes great flash photos in auto or A/S but the lack of anti-shake in Aperture, Shutter, Program, or Manual modes is worthless to my jittery hands. On a tripod with self-timer it is great. After 2 months and over 4,000 shots I went back to my trusty Konica-Minolta Dimage Z6 with the best anti-shake and lowest ISO(50-320) of any camera I ever used. What I lose in mega pixels I gain in film grain. Wanna buy a used S700? I'll just give it to one of my kids with steadier hands who likes to shoot in Manual mode. It does take quality pictures when the light is right."
3,"Nice, but limited","If you use this camera in good lighting & use the auto mode you'll find you'll be very happy over a typical point & shoot, especially when it comes to the 10x zoom which affords great freedom in composition. Unfortunately low light situations without flash are a real challenge for this camera, and the manual mode controls are a bit fiddly to deal with. I bought this as I thought it would be a good semi-slr solution but ended up replacing it with a Canon G9 instead, which for me is the perfect solution for anyone looking for the perfect compromise between point and shoot and SLR."
1,Must have the only dud,"I read all the great 5 star reviews on Amazon, and decided on buying the Fuji S700. Shipping via Amazon was prompt as always.The camera looked fine. but when I started to take pictures, the pictures were grainy and washed out, especially when viewed on a HDTV.I compared them to a 7.2M Sony W55 camera purchased by my son the day before. A world of difference. Not grainy, very sharp with vivid colors. I checked the settings on the S700, took pictures in low light and day light - no good. I will return the S700 today - shame it did not live up to the numerous great reviews."
4,The Color Purple!,"I'm given this camera 4 stars mainly for the price and 3 stars for image quality. This camera has major & noticable purple fringing in all the high contrast pictures I have taken so far. Even the pictures with flash show purple fringing in the pupils of peoples eyes when looked closely. I've never seen this with my other Fujis as well as Canon cameras. For the price I paid which was under $140 in like new condition, I can't really complain much as it also has a real optical zoom movie recording mode. Great outdoor movie quality in bright light but extremely grainy indoors in moderate lighting. My Canons, although they can't zoom optically during movie mode, have much better video quality in lower lighting without the graininess."
4,Fuli was a christmas hit,"I got this for my wife to replace and aging Canon, 3MP that wasn't fast enough to keep up with our kids. The only down side was I can't get it to self time as well as we would like . It would only go off 1/2 the time. Great pictures though, fast shutter speed , strong flash. Great battery life."
2,Frustrated with Grainy Indoor Shots,"I purchased this camera, because my 5mp Kodak's flash did not carry very far indoors (which made zooming indoors a lost cause)The s700 is much better in that area--the flash carries up to 15-20 feet, but the final results are grainy and disappointing.Outdoor pix are fabulous with the s700, but I have found that the majority of photos I shoot are indoors, and this 7mp camera can't hold a candle to the quality of the older 5mp Kodak that I have.Now, if I can just get the finishing quality of the Kodak with the flash capabilities of the s700 . . ."
5,FAB U LUS,"I couldn't be happier with a camera then I am with this one.the pictures are just amazing, the clarity of the zoom is wonderful.it is all I wished for and more."
5,Love my new Fuji S700 digital camera,"If you are looking for a realllly nice digital camera, I highly recommend this one."
5,Best camera I' ve ever used.,"Let me start by saying I'm just a hobbyist,But I absolutely LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!. I don't have any special equipment not even a tripod and I get crisp,clear,amazing photos almost every time. I've had allot of regular digitals like Kodak & Olympus but this one by far takes the best pictures for me. I can't put it down. My Kodak cost me about $360.00 and doesn't come close to the features and picture quality this camera offers. This camera is worth every penny and then some."
5,"Great camera, difficult download","After a few frustrating tries, I finally mastered the art of getting the memory card into the camera. This Fujifilm takes beautiful pictures; getting them downloaded onto my ""old"" computer was impossible, and I ended up taking the memory card to my local color lab and having the 57 images put on a CD. After downloading the included software and following the steps in the instruction book, I could only view 7 of the 57 images. The other 50 squares had only a faded blue flower. I ordered, online,the AC adapter mentioned in the instructions, but there was only one place to get it, and they had it on backorder so sent me a different one, which I haven't tried yet. All in all, the Fujifilm cameras are an excellent buy, in my opinion. This is my second one. They need to have the camera come complete with everything necessary for taking pictures and downloading to a computer, including the AC adapter if it's necessary for download on ANY machine at all."
4,Great camera for the price!,I mostly take family or point and shoot type of pictures but wanted a camera that I could take more artistic photos with when I felt like it. This camera seems to do just that but without the hefty price tag. We have been pleased with the photos thus far and I am looking forward to using the other options.
3,Good camera for the price,Good camera for the money.Long battery life.Camera doesn't seem to work well in low light but I would recommend for the price.
3,It's got quirks but it's still fun to use,"It's a bit hard to use for normal people who do not understand photography much. However it takes great photos if you use it well.Shutter lag is kinda bad, and the vibration reduction function is a mock, it uses faster shutter speed under high iso to make it happen, which produce grainy photos.You also gotta love the powerful 10x optical zoom, it's a beast in day light.On camera flash and white balance is not as sophisticated as say Canon's consumer cameras but it's acceptable.Video recording function is also fun to use, the zoom button works under video recording and the auto-focus is enabled which is great news. Sound recorded is decent.Battery life is decent, uses 4AA/rechargeable batteries. I suggest get extra batteries just in case first set running out during important functions.Camera supports SD-HC (after a firmware update) so you can use 4GB or 8GB SD cards no problem."
4,only minor criticism,"This is my first digital camera, and I used it mostly in ""auto"" mode. A couple of pictures in ""macro"" mode came out looking overexposed, but the ones in auto mode are very good. The camera has a very wide zoom range and a lot of megapixels for a small price. I'm still on the learning curve with it, but it appears to be a very good selection."
3,Fujifilm,"Its an okay camera i guess ... it kills the batteries way too quickly. and it actually came as is, no cords"
3,Good product but not so much features.,This camera is a good product for someone who start the amateur way to do a couple of shots with the enough quality and take good pictures.Thanks.
3,Good For Scenic/Landscape Photography ...but...,"I've taken many excellent outdoor photos with this camera, it was my first ""real"" digital camera. However I've come to find that it's terrible in dim lighting situations or when shooting fast moving objects even if you adjust the camera's settings. The camera also has poor image stabilization and I've often ended up with blurry images even when shooting from a stationary position (like a stand).I give it 3 stars overall, but I'm looking forward to upgrading."
5,Fujifilm Finepix S700,"The Fujifilm Finepix S700 is an older camera that the company no longer makes. I had one previously that I sent back to the company to try to get it repaired. They told me that I could pay to purchase a comparable camera, but they wouldn't be able to fix mine since they no longer make it. I have 2 other models of Fujifilm cameras. Each one has it's strong points, but THIS camera is the absolute best for taking pictures of people. I take pictures of the high school band kids and this camera never fails to take excellent pictures of them!"
4,Finepix S700 review,"This product is lightwight, simple to opreate and has excellent picture quality results. It has the capability to be used in all areas of normal family photo projects. Works well in outdoor and indoor use without a lot of preperation setup. It would have been nice to have identified carrying cases that could be used with this product prior to purchase."
4,good everyday use camera,í got this a month ago and im loving it.the 7.1MP truly give u a great deal of detail on the pictures.the 10x zoom is amazing and the definition on pictures taken with it is quite grand as well.the video mode works wonderfuly. this is hands down the best camera u can get for that price
5,Fujifilm Finepix S700 Review,"This is an outstanding value for the price paid. It has everything I wanted to add to the capabilities of my other cameras, 10X zoom and a long flash capability, 20 feet or more."
2,fragile,"Es una camara con un buen diseño, pequeña y liviana.la compre para regalo pero cuando la obsequie el sistema mostraba un error en el sistema de los lentes, deben tener cuidado pues aparentemente su sistema es bastante fragil.no incluye funda protectora y por sus dimensiones y sistema de lente fijo no es facil encontrar uno a la medida."
1,I expected much more,I really expected more out of this camera for the price. I am not happy with the quality of the pictures or the automatic focus on the device. I do not recommend this product.
5,A MUST read,"I don't know why there aren't hundreds of reviews on this book, because it's absolutely magic. If you're looking for comfort and evidence, buy it! I am grateful Elizabeth shared her insights with us, readers. As I am in the learning process of becoming an animal communicator myself, I am doing research in reading as much as I can. But first of all I am a grieving person who's animal friend recently died and I am besides myself with grief over this loss. Elizabeth shares her knowledge that all is as it's supposed to be. She enlights, she has such insight, and yet, as a scientifically educated woman, she does not take things for granted. The care-humans (as she calls them) of the pets, deceased or alive, acknowledge her words over and over again. Facts. I read this book of 143 page's in one day, up to late at night. Just couldn't stop. It was one of the most beautiful gifts I received. So just buy it :-)"
5,Excellent book concerning the dying process.,"I found this book to be extremely helpful during the grieving process. It helped me understand death from my dog's point of view. After reading this, I felt connected to my dog and less devastated by her absence. The book has also helped me understand the loss of my human companions, as well."
3,Less than expected,"I expected more about the topic and less information about the author. Decent reading, but not worth the money."
1,dont like it.,This Crystal Pink Feng Shui ball is very poorly made. It looks like it was just a glass ball the was cut to look like a crystal ball. It has lots and lots of bubble in it that can been seen very good. I would send it back but it would coast me more than I paid for it. I guess I will keep this glass ball or maybe just put in the trash. I will nevery buy from this co again. Not happy with this at all.
4,great value,"I ordered one, and I'm back for 5 more as gifts and other windows in my house. It makes a number of rainbows throughout my great room when the sun catches it. The rainbows are brighter the closer they are to the prism. My 2 year old loves them! The packing could be better, but for the price (one dollar and free shipping!) it is worth it!"
1,my review,"30mm vintage crystl pink feng shui ball: for one, it shows a string to hang it and yet does not come with the string. secondly, if it was a fake crystal such as acrylic or glass, and believe me, this one is fake--it did not specify so i expected a genuine authentic little crystal. i've now discovered i have to type in real hanging crystals in order to purchase an authentic hanging crystal. i wish it would have fully disclosed what this crystal was made of. very misleading. overall,it's cute if you want a walnut size fake plastic ball with no string."
1,Order all you need with the first order as the shipping charges with the second order is a shocker,"My first order of 3 cost a total of $13 with shipping. When I proceeded to order another 3 the total cost with shipping jumped to $39. Not worth it, will go else where."
3,Nice Rainbows,"I recieved a clear,not pink, crystal, but, all the same, it's very nice for projecting rainbows into the roomwhich is the reason I got it. I do NOT practice anything like feng shui, or occultic things, with crystals.I got this, simply to look at rainbows, GOD'S creation, when the sun passes through the glass."
1,BORING AS ALL GETOUT!! A SLEEPER!!,"It is very sad for a Christian to think that the best scene in a film is a sex scene. But that just so happened when I (the Christian in general) viewed this abomination. Thinking I'd see a film where the good guy fights Satan, I viewed this piece...that not only doesn't show the fight, but it appears that the main character (Johnny Depp) is going to have a friendly ""chat"" with Satan himself (That's what I got out of the last scene in the film). This film is boring, stupid, and makes ""Vertigo"" look like an actioner (I thought ""Vertigo"" was a good film). So it is sad to think that I sat through this film just to be entertained at the end by a thirty-second sex scene..."
1,REALLY dumb,This flick is promising for the first few minutes. Then not even Captain Sparrow can save it.
1,2 hours of my life I wont get back.,Your time and money would be better spent if you were to commmit these rescources to the study of your own ass!
1,The Worst Movie I Ever Viewed,I made the mistake of seeing this in the theatre...DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It is far and away the most disappointing movie experience of my like.
2,but no thanks necessary!,"Roman Polanski is a great director and the cast here is great (except for Mrs. Polanski, who could make wood look like Olivier), but I sat through this one and was disappointed.I was all set for a great supernatural detective thriller, with Polanski at the helm no less - what I got instead was a slow build of suspense, building... building... to no payoff. The plot turns on Balkan's (Frank Langella) hiring of Corso (Johnny Depp) to find and buy for him two rare books - but Balkan's jumping on a plane and stealing them himself! Why did he hire Corso in the first place? So Depp could have several witty exchanges with Langella on the phone, each time asking him ""Where are you?"" without answer? Not enough to hang a plot on, guys....Even if the ending is supposed to leave you to your own interpretation, as many reviewers have suggested, it's still a huge letdown and wrecks the movie.I'm still shaking my head at this one. Want a scary Polanski movie? Try ""Rosemary's Baby""."
2,is it over yet?,"This movie made you keep an eye on the clock and when it ended felt like a big waste of time. The ending left you staring at the screen asking what just happened, buy this only if you have the keys to the other eight gates."
2,Polanski's last plodding steps,"Fluff. With a certain Agatha Christie quality. No great meditation on Good and Evil. Just a shallow diversion to pass an evening. It descends into low comedy when Emmanuelle Seigner flies down a staircase and gives the villain a karate kick. I think a lot of people would turn the movie off at this point. As a matter of fact, I did. I couldn't imagine something further along that could justify this foolishness."
1,Sad to be illiterate,"I've never seen so many reviews telling me I'm dumb and illiterate for not liking a movie. I never realized literacy was so integral to watching film. I had been under the impression that it was more important in reading the book the film was based on (which I have, incidentally).So, let me break it down simply, being illiterate and all:Movie bad. Book good. Read book. Burn movie."
2,waste of time,"I reeeeaaaally wanted to like this movie. Yes, the opening credits were good. The movie itself, however, was utterly pointless and nonsensical...and yes, boring. Even the actors looked like they weren't taking it seriously. I'm convinced Polanski only made this film as a showcase for his wife (""the girl"")...Blech. Need some brain soap now."
2,LOCK THE GATE AND THROW AWAY THE KEY,"A book collector is hired to determine the authenticity of a book allegedly written by Satan. If this Roman Polanski horror vehicle helped finance his subsequent ""The Pianist"", well then, so be it. It is a rambling, increasingly tedious and superficial suspense thriller starring Johnny Depp, whose one-note negativism as an unscrupulous bibliophile doesn't contrast well with the overall dullness of the film. The lead lady's bizarre supernatural powers look like a paraplegic Peter Pan on training wheels."
5,Another Depp triumph,"I found this film to be riveting and thought provoking. Depp was as usual outstanding. I loved the fact that this film requires one to use their mind and imagination. Far from being dissapointed in the ending, I thought it was perfect and fitting."
2,saved by Depp,"Without Johnny Depp, the movie would have been a failure. Two reasons to buy it: Johnny Depp fans will enjoy his acting talents in a wiry and thrilling mystery. The other is to motivate you to read the novel that inspired the film""The Club Dumas.""."
1,The Ninth Gate,"This movie lacked any kind of suspense. Five minutes into the movie you could guess the plot. Was this movie supposed to be a thriller,horor,suspense, because it didn't make any of those categories."
4,A great change from tedious religious films,"Here's what there is to say: 1) Johnny Depp is terrific as Dean Corso, the man you hate but have to sympathize with. It's amazing how Depp can portray such a wide variety of characters. 2) The screenplay, for the most part, is what makes this movie. There are very few, if any, unnecessary scenes and elements like lighting are all very appropriate to mood and style. 3) It's not a horror film. Thank God. If this had been a cheesy horror flick I wouldn't have seen it. No ""dramatic buildup into nothingness"" as is too typical these days. 4) An interesting taken on Satanism without stereotyping everyone who takes an interest.The only problem with the film: A few ridiculous plot twists here and there. Where do they come from? Who knows."
4,A picture's worth a thousand degrees,"Overall a pretty good movie and definitely worth a rental and if you like the mystery or occult genres, a purchase. The Amazon review is correct that the movie, right up to the end, seems to be on the verge of something truly horrifying and shocking, but never delivers. That's true, but the movie is enjoyable on its own terms, just as the X-Files is enjoyable on its own terms even though it never delivers on its promise.The movie is well-casted and well-plotted. Although I disagree with most of Johnny Depp's choice of roles, I have to admit that Depp is one of the greatest actors of my generation. Some people are just naturals.It's a very European movie. That means lots of books, lots of faux-philosophical discussions and themes, lots of cigarettes and lots of espresso drunk out of semi-demitasse cups in coffeehouses. There is action in the movie, but it's not a driver like in American movies."
1,93 minute run time? Anyone else have this problem on the blu ray?,Amazon is offering this blu ray with the full 133 minutes. When I received the movie it says on the back that it is only 93 minutes-meaning that 40 minutes have been cut. I did not notice this until I started watching the movie and realized this was a comepletely different version. Has anyone else had this problem? I returned it and left a message of the problem and they sent me another one wth the exact same problem!So I called and they are going to investigate it. I already have the regular DVD and it has the 133 minute version but I love the movie so I wanted the blu ray clearity.So they are going to credit my account and I have to send this one back again.I guess it was not meant to be! LOL
4,This movie is a win win,"Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. Put him in a thriller/ horror flick and I know this is a movie for me. Pop it in, sit back and enjoy."
2,"I hate to say this, but this movie is terrible","I loved the book and I was really looking for ward to the movie adaptation. I was prepared for all the normal compromises you must expect. However this movie fails on most levels despite the best efforts of Johnny Depp. The script is just terrible, and nothing anyone can do can get past that.I can see why the movie bombed, there is just isn't much to recommend. The cinematography is good, even great in parts. So perhaps that might appeal to a film student. Otherwise the movie is without real merit."
1,"Despite the hype, a failure","This film had a simple plot that didn't seem to make time to explain virtually anything. For instance, a girl follows around and helps out the main character for the entire movie and they never make clear who she is or what she's trying to do. At the very end of the movie, the main charcter and this woman have sex outside a burning castle for no reason that myself, nor my peers could find. For me, the movie did not make a lot of sense and I considered it a waste of my time."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"If you were able to stay awake through this movie, then congratulations. I did too....barely. I really had high hopes for this movie. I love a good story, even if there isn't a lot of action, but this is ridiculous. In all, there was about 20 minutes worth of interesting scenes. The rest is Johnny Depp bumbling around Europe."
1,"Memorable, but not in a good way","I saw this film at the theater, which was a while back, and I distinctly remember falling asleep briefly, waking up, and being distressed to realize it still wasn't over. Had I been on my own, I would have gone home.The pace is s-l-o-w, and there's precious little suspense to keep up your interest. You know all along that all the pieces of the dread book will eventually turn up, so all you can really hope for is a big finale ending. But then you wait, and wait, and WAIT...It's probably not fair to say the ending was a disappointment because, by that point, life as we know it would have had to be annihilated in a cataclysmic technicolor explosion to make it worth all THAT waiting. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you generally enjoy long, drawn out, brooding films."
1,Now we have a 2nd reason to keep RP in Europe,"It's hard to believe the man who made ""Chinatown"" made ""9th Gate."" The former had a riveting plot overlain with incredible levels of meaning -- personal, political, societal. It's one of my top 10 movies ever.Technically ""Gate"" was well-made, but the plot was all surface. None of the moral questions raised about the hero were answered; nor were any of the plot elements. The ending felt like the answer to the question ""What's the quickest way to get this over with?""Could have been a good role for Depp if he'd been given a character with any dep(p)th. By the end, he seemed to be playing for gags, which was probably the only hope of saving his reputation.A waste of rental money and, worse, a waste of two hours."
1,I WANTED to like it!,I wanted to like it--really I did--but after watching to the end it was like eating a Twinkie when I was promised a full gourmet meal. I'm still hungry and I feel kinda sick. It's a waste of many (otherwise) talented people.
2,the synopsis was more interesting than the movie,"Nice idea, poorly executed. I kept waiting for something more interesting to happen... instead the story continued to drift without real purpose. The characters weren't particularly believable, or likeable, and there was a strong sense that something was missing. Like a decent script.The online editorial mentions ""Polanski's languorous direction and purposefully vague story..."" - as if that's a selling point. A movie is like sex: it needs a climax. And The Ninth Gate failed to fulfill. It wasn't even worth the foreplay."
2,Ninth gate must require reading the book,"I just watched this movie and I am wondering what I just saw. I guess the intent of the movie is to lead you to beleive that their is some magical way to become immortal (albeit via the devil) which is possible from putting clues together from several issues of the same ancient book. The ending is terrible, the plot is easily guessed, and the special effects make you wonder if something is wrong with your television. My recommendation is that if you desire to own this movie, rent it before buying it to verify it is worth the investment."
4,One of Depp's better roles,"First of all I have watched this movie 3 times now during my lifetime so far. This is by far a very strange film and mutiple elements that make you go what the heck is happening at times. But the basic plotline is threwout the movie and if you enjoy a good suspense triller as much as I do then you will enjoy this movie. There were a few moments the movie seems to drag along but Depp saves the movie with his amazing actor skills and sense of humor. I also enjoy how the movie was shot on locations very amazing shots of the layout of the country's. So if your into a suspense triller with some horror elements surrounding the film's direction as it pace itself along, then pick this movie up and enjoy another great Depp preformance."
2,Where's the ending?,"What crap - good start, suspenseful music, nice nude scene, but then it seemed like they ran out of plot and just faded to the credits."
1,Unsatisfying,"I'll start with the good things about this film:1. It introduced me to the book The Dumas Club which is now on my TBR list. Although I didn't enjoy the film I'm still keen to read the book because it's apparently a literary thriller, which I love. These types of books are notoriously difficult to adapt to the screen as so much of their charm is in language.2. The cinematography was great. There are some beautiful scenes and images which established the mood for this type of film.3. The basic set-up was intriguing and had great potential.4. Johnny Depp is hot.Now for the negatives, which can be reduced to one word: plot.After setting up the storyline the plot begins to meander all over the place and by the end the whole thing has become farcical. None of the questions raised are answered properly, we never know exactly who the mysterious blond girl is or if she's really working for Fargas at all. The ending is over the top, ridiculous, and very unsatisfying."
3,The BD disc is scratched by the eco packaging,"I don't know how the eco packaging can scratch the surface of the Blu-ray disc, but I can see that the scratch marks line up with the cut outs on the 'eco' packaging.Manufacturers should stop packaging Blu-ray discs in 'eco' packaging. The eco cases not only give no protection at all to the disc, but it seems to me that the cut outs can leave scratch marks on the disc surface."
3,SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL,"While I won't give away any of the storyline as reviewers sometimes do, I will comment that this movie makes Satanism look like a nude romp in the park. This may equate something with Polanski's odd existence but call me old-fashioned, I like at least one good-guy per flick. I enjoyed the chase during this film but like many reviewers found it anti-climactic, to say the least. Johnny Depp plays it close to the vest adding a brand-new character to his repertoire. You can easily forget it's him. All the acting is top-notch. If you are watching this film for the first time - pay very close attention - especially when the camera turns to something written on paper. Many clues are written. Also follow the names of the characters closely. For fans of the film, the DVD (itself) is excellent. Includes an audio soundtrack of Polanski describing every iota of the film while walking you through it, as well as a separate musical score. Worth at least a rental."
3,Read the Book,"An excellent and faithful realization of Arturo Perez-Reverte's ""The Club Dumas"" up to a certain point, at which it all goes to hell, literally! One thing's for sure, you can read the book or see the movie and neither will spoil the ending of the other. Although I understand the Satanist route, it seems like Polanski cut the last ten minutes of the movie, the scene wherein we learn WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON. As some other reviewers here have mentioned, the ending is extremely disappointing, and casts doubt back on one's enjoyment of the rest of what is really a very well made film. Still, Depp is an extremely versatile actor which is a rare trait nowadays, and the film is beautifully photographed and edited. On the other hand, the music is ridiculously inappropriate and viewers will burst out laughing in several points only because of the goofy soundtrack."
2,what was up with the ending,well this movie started out really interesting. but about an hour into you quickly lose any interest you had for it. the plot is basically about a book collector or actually he collects books for other people and he is trying to find out if this book i think it was called the nine gates or something of that nature is the origonal one. anywho the movie is kind of boring and a stupid ending that i didnt get. i would pass on buying this movie and i barely recommend renting it.
2,Where The Hecks The Ending?,"I think the idea here ws to create a commentary on human greed or 'evil' or some such. There is little action, OK acting and the plot drags on. Also, there is no ending, really; no climax, no nothin' after making you wait for SOMETHING to happen for 2 hours. It doesn't even fly as as an 'art' film; I like art films, and this doesn't cut it. I give 2 stars instead of 1 because the film locations are nice..."
2,?,Will somebody please explain the ending of this movie to me? Please...I was so confused after watching it.
1,One of the WORST movies I've seen in my LIFE,"I cannot believe that I wasted two hours of my life that I will never get back on this pointless drivel. The acting is mediocre at best, the plotline seems nearly pointless, the whole movie crawls along from one boring scene to the next, and the ending left me furious! I was upset at the director for making the movie, the actors for ""performing"" (you can't call it ""starring"" for this) in the movie, and myself for actually taking a chunk out of my life and wasting it on this disappointing farce of a show.I wish there were ways to give negative stars, but ""one"" is the lowest that the rating system here allows. Save yourself the anxiety and rent something else."
1,Bland and useless,"Not much to say about this one. The movie never seems to know what it wants to be, so I was always expecting something mildly interesting to happen. Well, Johnny Depp goes after a book, then after another, and yet another one...Not scary and not very suspenseful either, the acting was a bit weak (except for Depp), the characters flat (including Depp) and the whole movie was just slow and forgettable. Not really awful, just nothing special at all.A waste of time."
1,a complete piece of... waste.,"I watched this movie when it first came out in the rentals. Now the book was pretty boring and plain but I thought that maybe the movie might make more sense. Well, I was wrong. The movie, if indeed it was a movie, was awful. The main actor portrayed a disgusting waste of life and the main actress portrayed a ...demon [naughty girl]. Overall, the movie made no sense and the film was a complete waste of screen time. Frightening enough, some people that I know stated that they understood it and felt like they could relate to the movie. Do not buy this movie and please do not rent."
1,Save your money-,"-it's a God-Awful ""movie"" (despite Depp and Polanski) that should've been much better. Terrible script, plodding plot, when it ended, thank Allah!Too f**king bad they don't offer negative stars for a rating, this would be a shoo-in for minus infinity."
1,DOESN'T ROMAN POLANSKI KNOW HOW TO END ANY OF HIS MOVIES???,"This is the second Roman Polanski film I've watched which had a good beginning, extremely good plot development and then, NO ENDING! What a let-down! As other reviewers have said, ""The Girl"" is never explained, & neither is whatever is supposed to be going on when the camera zooms in on her eyes. Her behavior at the end of the film is never explained. The clean sweep where Frank Langella re-enters the film shows absolutely no thought or creativity. The elderly twin book-dealers disappear but, again, no explanation. And then that ridiculous finale which comes out of nowhere! Johnny Depp is totally wasted in this film. His character is never developed in a direction which would make the ending make sense. No more Roman Polanski movies for me until he hires someone who knows how to create satisfying endings to good stories!"
4,A movie worth watching!,"A very good mystery, The Ninth Gate, brings to the screen the story of a book searcher (Johnny Depp) who gets himself embroiled in the schemes of an evil and wealthy cultist who wants to summon the devil.The film follows his travels from the US to Portugal and finally to France for the final showdown.The plot, the setting, and the dialogues, are all very good!With slight elements of both the X-Files and the Prophecy trilogy, The Ninth Gate, is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. It is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over."
3,Fascinating...,"This film was perhaps more generally fascinating as a subject and as a theory rather than as a movie.It builds up with the help of Roman Polanski's unique creation of slicing atmosphere, but never quite climaxes the way you would expect a Polanski film to do.It seems to have a unique, dark, unpredictable air, but its ending doesn't reflect that and frankly spoils the good work laid down by Johnny Depp. Not one of his best films, it must be said, but a truly awe-inspiring take on the occult, Satanism and the workings of Beelzebub.You cannot help but be stricken by the clever interpretation of pure evil, the sickening graphic scenes of murder and destruction and Polanski's incredible ability to grasp your attention. It's just a pity that through an intricate, gripping plot comes an inadequate and disappointing end.fascinating but, ultimately no match for some of Polanski's other films, and other movies of Depp's."
3,Fails to meet its Promise,"I first saw this movie expecting a horror / thriller and impressed by the cast (Johnny Depp is excellent) was steadily absorbed by it's moody and suspenseful storyline. Unfortunately that's where you leave it - after being on the edge of your seat for nearly two hours, and playing guess and double guess what's about to happen - the end titles appear. A very brilliant idea for a story, is wasted and as good as the performances of Depp, and Langella and as impressive as the artful direction of Polanski is they cannot save this movie. Do yourself a favour - Rent before you Buy"
3,"Intriguing, but uneventful","The search for the ninth gate was very interesting. Tracking down old dusty tomes around the world searching for the true steps to open the ninth gate was very intriguing. However, at the end of the movie many questions were left unanswered. What was the ninth gate? Who was the beautiful woman who could fly? What happens?!? I wasn't disappointed by the movie, but I was frustrated that some of these questions were never answered."
3,Good story line that has the rug pulled out...,"I found this movie in the tradition of Polanski's films...beautiful, lush locations that reflect a quiet and sometimes superficial serenity; a film score that very aptly enhances the spooky mood. As always, Johnny Depp is well cast as the furtive, serious protagonist. Emmanuelle Saigner's eyes are haunting, hypnotic pools... and the story is properly gripping but for the vague ending alluded to by another reviewer. Worth watching, but be ready for the nebulous finish."
4,THE MOST FRIGHTENING MOVIE OF THE YEAR,"This is intelligent, and even a little disturbing. I was very surprised. After the reviews I had read I expected trash. I was just curious about it when I rented it. Anyone interested in smart, adult thrillers should check it out."

1,God-awful piece of crap,"When I watched this movie with my sister soon after we saw the theatrical trailer (which was much more intriguing than the movie) I looked at my sister and we both said ""What the hell just happened?"" This movie was terrible, boring, bland, boring, absolutely uninteresting, and I forgot to say BORING. Don't waste your money on this crap. Roman Polanski directed one of the worst movies ever with this one. People, don't see it."
1,BLOODY AWFUL,"I wish there was an option for zero stars. This is the worst book-to-film adaptation I have ever witnessed. I challenge you to read the book 'The Club Dumas' by Arturo Pérez-Reverte before watching the movie. Pérez-Reverte crafts wonderful tales and unfortunately most of his book was lost in the movie, and the rest was reduced almost to campy horror. The basic elements of the book are portrayed (gathering the elements necessary to summon the devil) and in the book, it all seemed plausible, yet in the film it was laughable. Having said that, I thought that Depp was a perfect choice for Corso. I still have hopes for 'Captain Alatriste' with Viggo Mortensen, the film adaptation of Pérez-Reverte's eponymous novel."
3,The Ninth Gate,"An awsome movie for those of us who like/love movies that embrase the dark side of life. If you are looking for fast pace action, you won't get it here. This is a phycological thriller."
2,Unsuccessful ambiguity,"An amoral dealer in rare books (Johnny Depp) is hired by a wealthy collector (Frank Langella) to track down and compare the only three extant copies of a book supposedly written by the Devil himself. Of course, the purpose behind this is not immediately clear, and the major strength of this film is the way in which it follows Depp as he begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Director Roman Polanski shoots this in a way that allows us to make the discoveries right alongside him. By the end of the film, however, numerous details have accumulated without amounting to much. I was left in the dark about the true nature of Depp's mysterious female guardian (Emmanuelle Seigner), and the significance of the film's final shot was lost on me. What began as an intriguing mystery ends as a confused mess./"
2,Where's the Beef?,"I am always up for a ""movie challenge"" but this film had me in stitches. Johnny Depp and the mystery woman ride away on their bike..hair not moving...background that's obviously fake...Was this made in the 70's? Also, the sex scene at the end with the mystery woman...the wild face...the terribly fake and overdone background coupled with even more hilarious music...I just could not get past the cheesy effects without howling with laughter...even the scene showing the dead Baroness in the wheelchair...more humor than fright. Sorry, I wasn't impressed, but if you like campy...it's great!!!"
3,Johnny Depp and Frank Langella,"I bought this movie to add to my Johnny Depp and Frank Langella collections. It's been a long time since I've watched this movie, but if memory serves me right---it's not that great. I haven't had a chance to watch it since I bought this---so don't know. Like I said, I bought it for my collection."
3,Good until the end,"TNG is a subtle (and obviously low-budget) film. No special effects. No demons or monsters. A ""Constantine"" this is not. At over two hours, it was rather long but the plot was interesting enough to keep me watching. A lot of that is thanks to Depp; I thought he did a great job. The ending, however, was rather lame; not what I had expected after investing 2+ hours in the movie. This could have been a good film but the ending was badly handled. If you already like occult films, then this will probably be o.k. If not, you probably don't want to invest your time and money in this one..."
2,Not a Valiant Effort from 'The Pianist' Director....,"Does this film deserve a write up? Well, okay, no. But, I love Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski so here it is: the cinematography is beautiful, as usual. But the story line and the acting at times, was weak. Please tell me why directors cast their wives when they clearly cannot act? Wait, scratch that, I already know the answer. Anyway, not worth the rental unless you are aiken to the likes of a bad mixture of ""Seventh Sign meets The Exorcist meets The Prophecy"". I'm glad I didn't pay full tilt at the theatres!"
1,very disapointing movie,"Watched this movie with a great expectation, but thought that it was very boring and lacked any sense. Still didnt have any idea what the heck was happening."
4,Engrossing,"Just watched this for the 2nd time on IFC. I won't repeat what others already have said. The actors (esp. Depp) were routinely excellent. The road trip scenery throughout Europa was especially welcome and set the tone so marvellously. Some of the editing seemed rather abrupt although. In certain scenes where the veil was puilling back ever so slightly - bam - scene changed. My other issue was certain parts of the soundtrack seemed out of place. While the mood was dark and slow throughout, as was the music, abruptly at times (the chase along the Seine) segued into action film stereotypical.I'm afraid I still have questions about the female lead's identity, but the film works nicely both ways. The ending thus is totally up to the interpretation of the viewer. Don't expect special effects and demons, do expect a wonderfully engrossing film based on the performances and pacing of the film. The juxtapositions presented to the viewer are mind candy. Enjoy and turn the lights down low..."
2,The Ninth Gate,Way too much sex. Story was good but there were so many obvious signs that Dean (Johnny Depp) that made the story a little goofy. I hated the ending. You knew it was going to happen. This was a real stinker.
2,"I rate the product, not the movie","In my case, I bought The ninth gate because I saw it many times and I have the original Book, El Club Dumas, the story catch you and make you feel like Lucas Corso... mistery, suspense, history, romance, humor... BUT, I need the DVD with spanish subtitles to share the movie with my family and TREE TIMES I receive it without subtitles, it's too bad wait for a wrong product... tree times. But for the movie, I give five stars, excellent."
1,Thank goodness I only rented it...,"or I would be stuck with this. 'The 9th Gate', also known as 'Hooked on Satan', is an intriguing-yet-frustratingly-obscure work. Johnny Depp, as usual, is fabulous, which is why I continued to watch this film to the bitter [did I say bitter?] end. With tons of symbolism that doesn't lead to any sort of enlightenment about a) the characters, b) the plot, c) the Point of this film, the movie seems to be a really long version of the message: 'The Dark Lord is bad'. A fine judeo-christian message, in itself, but did you have to take 133 minutes of my life to say it? If you are a hardcore Depp fan, you've probably already seen it [or made plans to]. If not, well...."
2,Watch it before you buy it,"Based on the previews for this movie I was fairly eager to see this movie in the theater. I would like to tell you that this movie is definitely not for everyone. It is not a horror movie. It is not really suspenseful. It is not at all what I was hoping for. Depp's character was interesting and played well but I never really felt any connection with him. I personally did not like the movie and could not wait for it to be over. Not only was the story fairly cliche'd and weak but the ending gave no real sense of a conclusion and left me wondering why what just happened actually happened. People into odd, artsy movies that aren't based on good writing or production will probably like it."
2,Great acting but no plot to support it,"Almost all the right elements were present; casting, cinematic mood, musical score. All that appears to have been missing was a script. Not even the brilliant performances of Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Frank Langella and Barbara Jefford can make up for the lack of true tension I have come to expect from a Roman Polanski film. Its a fairly long film (133 min) that spends most of that time building up to a totally non climatic ending. Although the character development of the protagonist (Depp) was well done and the photographic ""feel"" was superb, the plot lacked sufficient substance to support all the build up."
3,decent,"The only thing more bizarre than the ending...are the reviews on this page. It is always interesting that people are able to convince themselves that they know exactly what was going on, and anyone else thinking in an opposite direction...well, they're stupid. You can read all the reviews you'd like to read here - but that's about what they boil down to.This movie is fine. Not great, not bad - certainly not a masterpiece. Many parts of it are interesting - many parts of it are not. Johnny Depp was fantastic...on the other hand, Lena Olin slinks around this movie looking like Cat Woman from a bad old Batman rerun. It is interesting to see Depp get pulled into this evil, and to realize that someone that is not ""evil"" themselves...is actually the one that is the driving force bringing us to the 9th Gate. But again, the good is almost always counter with the outright goofy in this movie - and it comes in as being above-average, worth watching, but not fantastic."
3,"good,but...","I was thrilled when I found out that Arturo Perez-Reverte's novel The Club Dumas was being made into a film....even happier that Polanski was directing it.This is (unfortunately) one of those cases where you should read the book rather than see the film. It's another example of the film industry thinking that the audience doesn't want to use it's brain and don't want to be challenged. Another example of the dumbing down of America.So many crucial elements were missing from the film that it is unforgivable. I'm not going to go into them as they will spoil one of the best and most inteligent novels I have ever read.Still, it is a decent movie which I will watch again. Polanski remains as one of my favorite directors...although, I wonder if he even read The Club Dumas?"
2,huh?,"so the previews looked all like interesting and stuff, but uh, really the movie goes on and on and on...and then when you get to the end...nothing.all that fill in for a lame non eventful ending..worth renting if you really must see it, but reall you'll live if you miss it."
2,"Dull and overlong, even for Polanski","This film has an incredible, haunting theme tune (reminiscent of Pink Floyd's 'Great gig in the sky'). Unfortunately, you have to sit through 2 hours-plus of meandering silliness before you get to actually hear it. Johnny Depp is good as always, but cannot save an overlong flick that is just a notch above the monumentally bad 'Devil's Advocate'.With the exceptions of 'Rosemary's Baby' (and possibly 'Bitter Moon'), Polanski's films are generally overly drawn-out, though lightweight and unsatisfying. But this reaches new depths - there is very little to hold the attention, and you will more likely kick yourself for sitting through the whole flick.If you want to watch a very long, deep movie, you would be much better off with 'Dead Man' - a much better Johnny Depp film, from a much better director (Jim Jarmusch)."
1,Illogical and much too long,"I thought a Roman Polanski movie starring Johnny Depp would be great, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Depp is a rare-book expert who is sent on a trip to Europe to find a (you guessed it) rare book. The first 90 min or so are interesting and creepy but the movie completely falls apart in the last half hour. The actress whose character follows and protects Depp gives a terrible performance. Another problem with this film is that all the characters in the film see Hell as a place everyone wants to go to!"
2,no,"I seen this movie purely based on the fact that I love Johnny Depp, but this movie is just bad and quite boring. What is the point of the end anyway. And the picture quality is bad and so are the special effects."
2,A Let-Down,"Mildly interesting, mostly due to the fantasy elements and Depp's performance. But the story line just barely holds your attention, and the ending falls totally flat."
3,Read the book,"The book (The Club Dumas) that this movie is based on has a lot of postmodern elements, with the protagonist, Corso, occasionally believing that he is a character in a book, parallelism to the Three Musketeers, Moby Dick, and the COunt of Monte Cristo in various places, and intentionally archetypal/transtextual characters. Oh, and the devil, sort of.It's much better for it; and none of that fun intertextuality actually came through in the movie. The movie manages to pull off a gothic occult thriller vibe, but the book is far deeper (or, more specifically, ""richer by association,"" in case you didn't look up ""intertextuality"")"
4,keeps you guessing,"this is a great movie if you are into dective/thriller type movies. it does move a bit slow in parts. the movie is about a ""book detective"" so to speak. he is hired to track down a book that was supposdly written by the devil himself."
3,Ending with no pay off,"This movie might have been as memorable as any Hitchcock film ever made if the screenplay had left you with any sense of what happened at the end. Johnny Depp turns in a strong performance of a book detective looking for two of three books supposedly capable of conjuring Satan himself. The film is beautiful to look at from a cinematography aspect - the lighting is extradordinary, and the acting is solid. The slow pace of the film wouldn't have bothered me, but I waited for the ""pay off,"" which never came. The ending is vague, and most people - me being one of them - will have no idea what became of the main character. Even less satisfying than ""Eyes Wide Shut."" Both films are technical works of art if set design, cinematography, editing, and soundtrack score are the only things you take into account. This movie could have been a lot more engaging and a lot less confusing."
3,What happened to this movie.,I found this movie very gripping. I found many of the concepts facinating. Many of the characters are captivating and very well thought out. Every character has hidden agendas and mystery. However for all the movies greatness it fails at the end. Nothing is explained and there are not enough clues for the audience to make their own minds about it. Almost seemed that they got to the end and didn't know what to do. A brillant movie that is let down at the end.
5,How mysteries are understood.,"Who is this thing called Mr. Evil? The answer that Johnny Depp's character finds is apparently ""The Ninth Gate"", as a Light-doorway is entered to find the solution. It appears to me that director Polanski knows more than he says and tries to lead the viewer from the mundane to what is behind things. That which we in the ordinary life and interests call evil is, like Depp's Corso, a blind for the seeker and his quest for answers.I love the artistic approach to the Bookman's world in all its variety and I watch this movie over and over for the mystery and thrills of hearing the forbidden discussed. If you have no seeker's soul this movie will bore you. Buy the book. But if 'mysteries' means to you something a bit more than this is a fun movie."
3,Ninth Gate - interesting if you dig deep,"One has to be a Roman Polanski fan to make this film really work - to be motivated to dig deep for meaning, etc. If not then it's simply a great video to watch on a rainy day in the absence of anything else."
3,If you've read the book...,"then this movie really doesn't come up to scratch. The book ('The Dumas club' by the Spanish author Perrez-Reverte) was an intricate detective story with a couple of killer twists; the movie is, basically, half the book. If you liked the imagery of the movie then I seriously reccomend you read the book (which is a bit of a cross between Raymond Chandler and Umberto Eco), however if you've read the book, do not see the movie. It can only let you down! One of the major problems (apart from the hacking apart of the story) is that Polanski builds up suspense only to ruin it all by showing too much. Scenes that would have worked really well in the background are played in main view and consequently, we're really given little doubt about what is going on. However, the atmosphere is nice and Depp is superb. Probably if you don't expect too much then this is a very nice film, but it's not up to the suspense of Rosemary's baby, as noted in the other reviews"
2,Simply a self-indulgement for Polanski. Nothing clever or surprising about anything in this film,"I only sat through the entire thing because I had read comments suggesting that the ending was ""special"". Nothing of the sort. What you see in the first 10 minutes is what you get for the rest of the film. It looked as though Polanski was trying his hand at satire, to be honest. I do not recommend."
3,Thought Maybe They Had Added An Ending This Time,"The visuals are stunning, but the joke when this came out among my friends was that it had no ending. Like the Director just ran out of ideas. Well perhaps he'll have time to think one up now. Meanwhile as a blu-ray transfer it is great, but blu-ray can't fix the fundamental flaw."
2,Good movie - until it ended...,"Listen, I liked this movie as much as everyone else below. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor - the characters were well defined - good story - the movie was soooo good - and then it ended and you're like ""What?"" - I did of course figure out what happened but it did not fit the pace of the rest of the movie. It could've been soooo much better. The whole pace of the movie builds you up for some spectacular ending that never happens. The ending was a disgrace to the entire movie and made me hate the whole thing. Whats the point of a great story line if it doesn't carry you through to the end? If they had made a sequel that picked up from the end, I may have reconsidered my position on this movie - but since the sequel never came this movie is a disgrace to good movies.Needless to say, I was very offended. This movie would've easily been one of my favorite movies but now I will never watch it again.Great story line, great acting, great directing, TERRIBLE ending."
2,The only point of this movie is the nudity...,"Because I've become somewhat of a Depp fan in recent years, I picked up The Ninth Gate from a $5 bargain bin at walmart.I had never heard of the movie and the premise was wonderfully intriguing and full of potential. Unfortunately the movie did not fully take advantage of this potential. I actually enjoyed the first 70% of the movie. The mystery alone had me glued me to the screen. In the last half our or so, however, all of the movie's worth was nullified. I enjoy a movie that leaves questions unanswered, but this movie left the WRONG questions. Because of this blunder, the story didn't matter to me and, in the end, it seemed that the entire point of the movie was to facilitate two nude scenes.If you're into movies that are just for nudity, I'm sure there are better ones out there. If you're looking for a wonderfully compelling and thought provoking story, I suggest you look elsewhere. I, for one, want my $5 back...~Ben H"
1,I understand the bad reviews.,"The Ninth Gate begins promisingly enough, a tale about the search for a book that was written by the devil. After the first 10 minutes, the movie goes downhill, but slowly, considering the snail's pace this film moves. Add to that an incoherent script and you've got a camp classic."
2,The Johnny Depp Midas touch is no more,"I'm afraid this recent addition to the apocolyptic genre was to its detriment. The movie moved at a glacial pace, leading me to watch the clock every 10 minutes. The script was bad, the scenery was good...if you're looking for another ""Sleepy Hollow"", keep looking."
1,Indiana Jones without the action,This movie has some great plot twists but it has a hard time reaching a peak. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful perfomance of somebody whom the viewer hates in the beginning and is rooting for in the end. Frank Langella also lends an outstanding role as a behind-the-shadows badguy for most of the movie. This movie is worth seeing but it should not be on the top of anybody's list of must sees.
1,"AWFUL, if I could give ZERO I would!","This movie has all the feel and cinematography of a ""B"" movie. The acting is awful. The story line is rediculous!The character played by Johnny Depp is a rare book dealer of questionable morals. He is hired by Frank Langella's character -- he owns a rare book called ""The Nineth Gate"" which was supposedly written in union with the devil. Read through properly this book is supposed to summon the devil himself. He wants Johnny Depp's character to find the other three books remaining in existence. Through the entire movie you see him searching for the books, dead people are left in his wake TEDious I hope to save you from wasting your time and money!"
2,Good right up to the end,"I watched this film twice during two days because I thought that I had missed something the first time, I hadnt. When I finished watching it the second time I realised that either A)Polanski had left tons of stuff out or B)The ending was bad to begin with. You are presented with numerous clues that you try to solve along the way which is fun, But by the time you get to the end you have more questions than answers. If only the ending matched the rest of the movie. I think I will read the book....."
3,Try the book,"The movie was alright, interesting but not completely engaging. The best part of the movie was that it turned me onto the book, which is very, very good. The depth of the book is almost impossible to translate into a film."
3,"Its OK. Not Great, But OK","This is not a film about the occult in the same style as the ""Exorcist"", more like ""Rosemary's Baby"". Events in the film can have both paranormal and non-paranormal causes. Both Roman Polanski and Johnny Depp do their jobs competently but there is something missing from the film, like a better ending. It was goofy. What does the picture in the book signify? Was the Frank Langella character just crazy or was there more to the whole mystery of the book?It was better than I thought it was going to be; don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
2,"Good for the first hour, starts to fall apart after that.","My review of The Ninth Gate would be more of 2.5 star rating. Roman Polanski's devilish thriller doesn't really offer anything in the thrills department. It moves at a slow pace, but it's a very intriguing film, and certainly better than the similarly plotted Angel Heart. The problem with The Ninth Gate is that it really ends up going nowhere. After a very well-done first hour, everything unravels, as we begin to realize that Polanski is just filling the running time up as much as possible. The final scenes are also a cheat, it's easily one of the most disappointing endings in a long while, not only because of its abruptness, but also because of its contradictions, as the white light interferes with the film's dark tone. If you ever watch the film, you'll know what I mean."
2,NICE TRY,"WHILE THIS MOVIE HAD A GREAT STORY LINE (A QUALITY MOST NEWER MOVIES ARE LACKING) I FELT THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PORTRAED BETTER THAN IT WAS. THE PREVIEWS WERE VERY MISLEADING SO THE VIEWER HAD EXPECTATIONS OF ACTION AND ADVENTURE, WHILE THE TRUTH IS THAT IT WAS VERY TAME. THE DEPP FAN THAT I AM I WENT TO SEE THIS FILM WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS. THIS WAS NOT A TYPICAL DEPP FILM, IT WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTING IN COMPARISON TO SLEEPY HOLLOW OR EDWARD SCISSOR HANDS. IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A SLOW DRAWN OUT DETAILED STORY WITH OUT MUCH ACTION THIS MOVIE COULD BE ENTERTAINING TO THE RIGHT VIEWER."
5,Enlightenment via the Left Hand Path,"This is sophistocated film fare for many U.S. viewers; at least that is this viewer's guess as to its nonstartle debut. Likely, the film angered and confused both the Christian Right and those card carrying members of the Practical Qabala. Upon seeing the film, I went out and purchased (and read) the book, El Club Dumas. Polanski has well articulated the very dangerous Left Hand Path of spiritual inquiry, its casualties seeking powers, and the one seeker (played by Johnny Depp) who is transformed from a researcher mercenary into a true seeker of spiritual truths. Polanski depicts the Left Hand Path very well. It is fun!"
5,Mephistophilian Phun...,"Director Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant) teams up w/ Johnny Depp (A Nightmare On Elm Street, Sleepy Hollow, Secret Window, From Hell) for this entertaining slice of devilish hokum. Depp plays rare-book dealer / con-man, Dean Corso, who is sent on a mission to locate, authenticate, and nab two copies of a legendary tome. Unfortunately, these editions are far from ordinary, dragging Corso ever deeper into a supernatural conspiracy of satanic eeevil. Heavy w/ forboding atmosphere and full of odd characters, THE NINTH GATE is the best occult-mystery I've seen since CLOSE YOUR EYES. Depp is (as usual) excellent, as are Frank Langella and Lena Olen. Emmanuelle Seigner is unforgettable in her role as the green-eyed girl. Highly recommended..."
5,Green Rushes,"I purchased this book as a gift for the fiancée of my friend. She reported back that her fiancé really enjoyed the book. In fact, he enjoyed it so much he was reading it for the fifth time since Christmas (one month ago).While the book is quite expensive, it must be worth it because it is very hard to find and, apparently, very enjoyable."
3,Please Pass On The Pepper,"""Surf Ride"" is an early look at a giant of jazz who recorded over a thirty year period, but who is probably, and unfortunately, remembered as much for his personal problems and incarceration as for his music. This album, recorded over several sessions and with almost a dozen different musicians, suffers from a lack of cohesion among musicians, and a lack of confidence in playing by Pepper. The exception comes on the tunes with Jack Monterose, particularly the title-track, ""Straight Life"" and ""Thyme Time."" They are definitely a step up from the CD's first few quartet tracks, and they almost turn this into a four star effort. With so many classic Pepper CDs available from OJC, including ""Smack Up,"" ""Intensity,"" ""Meets the Rhythm Section"" and ""Gettin' Together"" (see my review), you can pass this Pepper."
5,Good screwdrivers,"Comfortable handles, very good tips. Not suprising because S-K always makes very good tools."
3,Umm! Pretty Good!,What can I say? The CD provides good quality music. I have all of their work and this is by far the best CD in my opinion. There is nothing spectacular about the music but it is good! I was hoping for more songs like peanut butter.
3,Not so hot episodes.,"Homer. That's all I want from the Simpsons. Marge is annoying, Bart is a weener, Lisa never shuts up, and Maggie annoys me the least out of these four! Homer is the most deasent charactor on the show, and these episodes focus on the other four or anothor annoying charactor on the show. Only the Homer episodes are worth watching."
3,Disappointing...Compared to earlier Veggies,"I am a huge Veggie Tales fan! I was a fan before I had my own children. I would highly, highly recommend the original Veggie Tales episodes (before 2003)! Unfortunately, with the fall of Big Idea Productions, Veggie Tales just isn't what they used to be.I was terribly disappointed viewing ""The Duke and the Great Pie War"" - the quality and message just wasn't the same. So much so, that my husband & I searched the web to find out what happened to Veggie Tales! (If you have the time you can read the details on www.philvischer.com)Don't get me wrong - compared to what else is being produced out in the world - it is great, yeah! a wholesome message for kids! It is still entertaining. It was just obvious to me that the true heart & soul behind the original Veggie Tales series is missing - Phil Vischer is only involved in the writing of one episode a year these days. I look forward to finding out which episodes these will be!"
1,No spanish product,"It seems that after Jonah's movie, BigIdea does not develop any spanish speaking products for Christian children. I pray that they change their policy one day."
1,Mean-Minded,"I purchased this classic thinking it would be funny and entertaining in the manner of Mark Twain's great works. However it's just mean-spirited and off-putting, not at all funny, indeed disgusting. I'm giving it to the charity book sale."
3,"Good book, bad editing!","The story was interesting, but the editing was pretty poor. There were constant grammatical mistakes, like ""had got"" or ""Rashid looked really shook."" Let me know if you need help, Mr. Follett, I'd work cheaply."
3,An interesting read...,"As others have already noted, this is not a typical Follett book. It is an interesting read, however, for anyone who wants to get a first-hand perspective of what Iran was like during the revolution.My sense is that some aspects of the tale, especially all of the narrow escapes and the doggedness of the Iranian official who was cast as the villain, were embellished quite a bit to make the book more interesting.It isn't the most engrossing of reads, but I've seen worse. If Follett had been given a free hand in how the final product was presented, it would have been much better. Perot's fingerprints are all over the place, particularly in the overly glowing descriptions of EDS employees."
3,Puff piece,This was a puff piece for Ross Perot. It did becomeinteresting and tense because of the work they were all doing. Maria
2,Follett's worst book.,"I have read several of Follett's books and this is his worst. It is plodding and boring. It has the advantage of being real, but that is where it also falls down. Not every real story has to be told, and this is one of them.It is obvious the reason this book was written was Perot had the money to pay Follett to write it. If it weren't for that, we would never be inflicted with this book.I would have given this book one star, but it does have a moment or two, but that is all.If you haven't read Eye of the Needle, read that instead."
3,"Interesting reading, but not exciting","This was an interesting look at something that really happened. Unfortunately, it did not read like a normal historical adventure novel. It was more like a nonfiction account with some novel material thrown in here and there to try to keep you interested. I read the first 100 pages or so and began to grow disinterested. Finally, I stopped altogether."
3,"""US embassy bashing at its worst""",This is in defense of the U.S. embassy staff. In defense of Ambassador Sullivan I am sure he would have done something for the 2 illegally detained EDS employees if he didn't have to worry about the eventual evacuations of EVERY OTHER AMERICAN AND THEIR CAT AND DOG (for if he didn't a lot more AMERICANS would have become ILLEGALLY DETAINED) since the whole thing took place in an atmosphere of POLITICAL UNREST in 1979 and if Mr. Perot were really worried about his employees he would have had them contact some other Ambassador like Ken Taylor or Tony Parsons.
1,Someone Should Have Rescued This Book!,"Boring, boring, boring. The writing style of this book is dry and dull. It sounds like it was dictated by Perot. With all the high marks that readers have given this book, I can only guess that they are all EDS employees, or Perot himself.Its nice that these people were resuced, but nothing heroic really happens. They wait in a hotel till the prison is stormed. Then they drive across the border. What else could they have done. Perot should have probably pulled out of Iran earlier.Perot is always negitive about goverment, but he owes his fortune to goverment contracts."
4,Outstanding book about entreprenurial Businessman who tells it like it is and acts the way Presidents like JFK used to-Strongly!,"When JFK was confronted with missles inCuba, he didn't act the way that 90-I.Q.idiot @ 1600 Pennsylvania has towards9/11 - attacking a country that had noth-ing to do with it, Iraq! Kennedy told thecommies to get the missles the hell out ofCuba and they did! Perot had employees ofhome of his Co.'s taken prisoner - and hegot them back. When Perot was good, alongwith the late Gen. ""Bull"" Simmons, wantedto know about prisoners of war in southeastAsia, he sent Col. James Bo Gritz in thereto bring them back. Then came two disspirit-ed runs for the White House and Perot wiltedinto Economic Charts, graphs and paid for ap-pearances on jerks like Anti-American LarryKing's show. What a let down. Still Follettis a fine writer and captures Perot at hisbest before the little guy's ego got awayfrom him and when he refused to help Bo getelected in '92!"
5,A Very Good Book!,This is a very well written book. It is an excellent writeup of Ross Perot's daring rescue of his employees from Iran when they were arrested by the Iranians during the revolution. There were some interesting characters in this book. One of the more noteable characters was Bull Simon. This book describes the rescue from start to finish. You will admire the cunning and bravado of the hostages as well as their rescuers. You will also come to admire the raw nerve of H. Ross Perot. You have to remember that this was Iran at it's most dangerous time. You will also become a fan of Ken Follett. Read this book. You will not be dissapointed.
4,Narrative Non-Fiction At Its Best,"I picked this book up to read after visiting Mr. Perot's office. The book is a testimony to the commitment of a boss and fellow workers to risk it all to take care of your people and your friends. Whatever the debate within the State Department about Perot not giving diplomatic measures time to work, Perot realized time was of the essence and decisions could not wait.A side lesson, apropos for today, was the rescue teams requirement to negotiate with government officials, tribal leaders, mullah's, and anyone toting a gun to achieve objectives or make progress.This is a book about men who were selfless, placing their lives in great danger, adapting on the fly, and then returning to America to work in their buisness suits. A rare group indeed."
3,Interesting,Interesting but not great literature. I chose because of the history. The EDS employees and the leadership of Ross Perot were outstanding. Yes I would recommend this. It was informative of the events in IRAN and the failure of our government for backing the wrong horse.
4,Excitement!,Anyone who likes a book that holds their interest until the very last word will love reading almost anything by Ken Follett. This one differs from most of his others but is very exciting and interesting to the very end. This author deserves a try by anyone who has never read him.
4,Great Read.,This was a fun book to read. I was aware of the characters and the crisis but not all the detail Ken Follett provided. It made for an interesting book and one that adds to my knowledge of the times and the people involved - especially Ross Perot.
5,Fact is more interesting than Fiction,"In his book, On Wings of Eagles, Ken Follett does an excellent job of providing the reader with background on the company's employers and the events leading up to their imprisonment in Iran. His engaging account produces a novel that is, in many ways, more interesting than a fictional story.On Wings of Eagles"
4,A real thriller and its not fiction,"I really enjoyed this book. I generally read fiction, but this is a true story that is exciting and well written. I gained a lot of respect for Ross Perot. He stood by his employees and rescued them from an impossible situation."
2,A disappointing Read,"Quite a Ken Follet fan, I was very disappointed with this book. Although non-fiction, it was possible tomake such an exciting story a bit more interesting to the reader.The way that Ken Follet went out of hisway, time and time again to praise Ross Perot, it almost seemed as if this book was financed by Perothimself. Compared to Follet's other books, I found this book to be quite boring, and as I said before, verydisappointing."
4,Non-Fiction,"When some of the employees of the large company that made Perot lots of money get into serious trouble he doesn't get much joy from official channels.Therefore, he decides to put together his own official rescue insertion and retrieval operation to get his people out.An interesting tale, indeed, alongside Follet' other fictional works.3.5 out of 5"
4,Great Book,"It is as interesting as any of Tom Clancy's books with out boring you with 60 different plots that you know will eventually come to geather. It is great non-fiction book that lets you emerse yourself in the characters as well as the events of the time. If you have to do a report for school it is a great book, but it is just as good if you are looking for an interesting non-fiction read. A real page turner."
2,Interesting history,"The history is interesting, but the book is long on details, a lot of them not important. If you looking for a thriller or action kind of book, this isn't it."
5,Extraordinary Story,This book is about a true events that actually took place and it shows the committment that some companies have for their employees. Not many companies will spend millions of dollars of their own money to rescue their own people from the confines of a country that is about to drop into a civil war.I enjoyed this book a great deal and it gave me a great insight into Ross Perot and his relationship with his employees.
4,amazing but true!,"Breathtaking,unputdownable,novel ,the stuff of movies.,well why havent they made a movie about this. But hey !Argo just came out in the theatres ,i really enjoyed it ,but on Wings of Eagles would have made a great Movie .Ken Follett at his best."
1,not what you think,"I ordered a pair of the Mens Guide Gear 2000 gram Bruiser waterproof boots Mossy Oak, and they are not the boots in the photo, I was very disapointed,"
1,too much snotty attitude,"This book is a drag. After I read it I threw it away, without reading it to my kids. Allegra is rude and snotty about the food offered to her (blue pancakes). She won't eat it until her parents threaten to give it to her brother. Then she selfishly eats it, only so he can't have it. She finds out she likes it. However, she maintains the rude snotty attitude for the next thing. I would prefer a book that teaches right attitudes and manners, instead of one that models rotten ones."
5,The Best Of Village People,Employees chose to be Village People for Halloween. Couldn't find CD in any store. Found CD on Amazon - price was great! Service was great!
5,The best from the best disco group going,"We all hate to admit we really liked this group back in the 70's disco era. More than any other disco group, their music was ""alive"" and bursting with fresh energy. Their shows were one big party and their dancable numbers carried some gay sub-culture messages. So what! These were great songs whether you danced to them or just listened. They represented freedom and it would do well alot of narrow-minded people to just listen to the joy and fun they represented and gave us."
5,Awesome!!,I love this album. It's fantastic. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great music.
5,The memories alone make you smile!,"The memories alone make you smile! I didn't know that Village People had more hits than just YMCA, Macho Man and In The Navy. I saw a list of Hot Cop, San Francisco/Hollywood, Can't Stop the Music in ""villagepeople-official"" website and it got me to thinking that there was more to this group. The CD is clean, fun and very danceable. From start to finish, I could sing along. That's a fun CD."
5,The original boys band!,"No doubt about it, the Village People were the original ""boys' band""; they were put together by a marketing genius and each member of the band was there to correspond to a different fantasy. But boy, did they produce some great toe-tapping, dance-your-[rear]-off music! I still use this album to do aerobics, because from the first bar, you have just got to be moving when you hear them. Definitely the best group of the disco era. Buy the album!!!"
2,"My dad is not proud of me,","Oh, the music that changed me. I was there, sitting in the corner, sucking on a beer, when I heard 'Yummie', and...and something tweaked inside of me. I looked down at my steelcaps, looked down at my beer, looked at my tough long johns, and began to question myself. I looked at men there. The music made me look at the men there! I looked at them!!!!!!!!!! I have NEVER looked at men there before, but the music made me do it! I will never set foot inside a tractor again. I am unworthy."
1,worst kind of music of all time,"who would want to pay 10 bucks to listen to disco songs that are $#% okay and second of all whats so great about the song YMCA its not a good song worst song of all time and people like this band?!?!? intead of rock music?People whats the better genrewell rock of course!!disco died right when it was made upthe village people arent good there songs are pretty #$% if you ask me Hot cop?!?!? why would somebody write a song about the seductive nature of a cop?!?!? why people why would somebody buy thisbuy or re buy dark side of the moon instead this worthless disco.... ""music"" yeah whatever"
3,poorly made,I chose this rating due to the fact that I believe I was mislead. Maybe not on purpose but nonethe less mislead. This book is so poorly printed that I cannot even read it. It appears to be a photo copy of an original and I expect that this would be another edition that was printed. I am disappointed and should have sent it back. Instead I am donating it to the library
4,Dred; a Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp,"I just read that Harriet Beecher Stowe's second book was as popular as her first, so I wanted my book club to read it as one of the selections for the coming year. But, the price of the book was quite prohibitive and I will have to choose another book for my selection. I am happy to have it in my book collection though."
3,nice cookbook,Its a nice cookboook. i could see were someone not from south Louisiana would really get some good use out of it.
5,"Bon appetit, y'all!","This book is a 10 out of 10!!! I love the recipes, but mostly I love the author's approach to the subject. His connection, his love of the culture is evident with every page you turn. You just can't go wrong with this one!"
3,"Son Of A Gun, Gonna Have Big Fun On The Bayou",This book is chock full of recipes for all the cajun and creole classics. It's a good choice for those who are able to follow an ingredient list and step by step instructions. It may not be the right choice for those who need color photos to show what the food should look like. It's well worth the price for the recipes but don't expect photos of the food. I can't wait to throw some cajun feasts on the deck this summer.
5,Let Me Testify!,Let me tell you this one really cooks baby!I ordered it because of the Mardi Gras King Cake & I made it & everyone loved it!
4,"Other review ""odd""","I do not own this product... yet the person reviewing it with 1 star - is not reviewing the product, but complaining about shipping and taping of a rip - neither of which are Amazons problem... nor did the person get in touch with amazon to try and resolve this. Really strange review. Could not resist to respond to such an odd review on my search for a good fan:)"
4,"It's patchy, but there's some great stuff on here","Like a previous reviewer, I picked this one up in a bargain bin, for fifty cents. Apparently obscure German synth-punk from the early 80s is not a big seller at Camelot Music.It's a startlingly unique album. Haphazard disco beats collide with chaotic, mistuned guitar squeals. Ludicrous German lyrics are barked in a frighteningly militant voice (one track translates to: ""I'm the sexy Lola/Der Liebling of the fashion/I have a pianola/at home in my drawing room/everybody knows me/but no one can touch my pianola."" WTF?). Synths chirp and squawk amidst the din, and anyone who thinks that synths are incompatible with punk rock needs to listen to this album.There are also a number of more sober, orderly tracks, mostly repetitive, slower in tempo, and heavier on the electronics, but these are less interesting than the aural assaults.Recommended tracks: ""Die Lustigen Stiefel"", ""Die Fesche Lola"", ""Co Co Pino""."
1,Watch Out!!!,"There are a lot of guys trying to sell these, but most are scams. Unless you have the matching code that goes with the remote, it cannot be programmed into your car.Each remote has in internal code, and it is not written on or in the unit. Most of the units being sold are used, and the seller has NO IDEA what the code is. They sound very straight up, warning you that a Volvo dealer must program it into your car. However, you will get to the dealer and he will ask you for the code, then apologize that he is unable to help you out.So unless the vendor provides the code, it is a useless piece of junk. Ask. Notice that this vendor doesn't mention the code. I believe the reason is because he doesn't have it, or else he would be advertising it in big letters to set himself apart from the scammers."
4,Load center,"It is what it is. My old load center was a ""CH"" style box, so this was a cost efective upgrade. It arrived in a timely manor and undamaged."
3,Not enough luster...,"The ring didn't have enough luster or detail for me. Didn't care for the inside of the ring either. Not rounded solid on the inside, but rounded hollow like a trench."
4,Patriotic Ring,"I used to own a cheap two ring set by Tommy Hillfigger that got more comments than rings 100 times the price. Alas, it was cheap: cubic zirconia, enamel colors that faded over time and the jewels fell out. I wanted something to replace it, so the search for an elegant, cheap US flag themed ring led me to this ring. It is higher quality than my last since the band is made of silver alloy, it has cheap jewels and uses enamel that will fade, but that is to be expected since it costs so little. The ring when worn, is very pretty, worth the price, though since the band has a hollow and concave interior it will fit much looser than a typical ring of the same size. I recommend this ring, and it has served me well thus far."
1,Do not buy unless you want to pump 20 times for 1 drop of soap,"this looks nice on the counter, but the functionality of it will drive you crazy. I am not exaggerating, I literally have to pump the soap dispenser at least 10 times and usually up to 15-20 to get a tiny drop of soap out. I thought this might get better with time, but even after a week it is still the same. I am using a regular thin soft soap too, nothing thick.If this device worked it would be great, but unfortunately it is junk if you really want to get soap from it.Also since it is from a 3rd party seller it is a hassle to return, and you only get store credit from their store (not from amazon). pain!"
1,"this book wasn't really written by Gordo, obviously.","it is full of inaccuracies about the space program. 3 examples ( to keep it brief ). a. gene kranz was never planning to get into Grissom's Apollo 1 spacecraft for the test. ( kind of hard to do when Gene was always in Houston.) b. Mercury retrofire does not slow you down from 17,500 mph to 12,500 mph, it slows you more like 300 mph, that's all it takes. c. Russian spacecraft are not ' circular '. spherical is more like it. I am sure that Gordo gave the co author a few topics to write about, then let him write the book. big mistake !!! if you want a good book, read gene kranz, charlie duke, or gene cernan, etc. write me your comments, dave s. Phoenix"
4,"gordon cooper, astronaut","I was well satisfied with the book, Gordon Cooper. very good transaction. He has been a hero of mine. I was fortunate to meet him some years ago."
3,One too many trips around the Earth,"The first part of this book is interesting. The whole Mercury program, the behind the scenes politicing, the trips into space. And then the book gets weird. It is always interesting when public figures give UFO accounts but it would have been nice to have some backup documentation rather than vague acusations about area-51 and the government hiding things. This government doesn't seem to be able to hide two people making out in an office nevermind capturing space aliens, transporting their ship somewhere, figuring out how it works etc etc. If two people can't keep a secret can the 100's that would have had to be involved in such a coverup keep a secret? Come on folks, this guy appears to have had one too many trips around the planet.Anyway its light summer reading and like I said, the first part of the book is fine."
3,Earth to Gordo ... Earth to Gordo ... please come home,"Gordon Cooper's accounts of the early Mercury program days are a good read. Cooper covers material that will largely be familiar to readers of other space program books, but adds his own unique perspective and insight. For this reason alone, the book is worth a read.Cooper speaks frankly to the now-famous story that he encountered a UFO during his flight of Faith 7; it never happened, he says. But there are other things he's seen as a pilot that he can't explain -- things that he describes as being not-of-this-world.From there, the author loses credibility quickly when he begins to talk about his attempts to unravel the UFO mystery with his clairvoyant sidekick. The reader is left with the impression that not all of Gordo made it back from orbit.Still, the book is worth a read, and the history (or Cooper's version of it) is an important piece of the story of man's race to the moon."
4,Leap of Wonderful Writing,"Gordon Cooper strikes me as an intelligent, level-headed and brave man.The Author did a great job and the whole book was a GREAT read.I got exactly what I wanted and more.I was amazed at this man's life experience and even more amazed to read about his UFO and potentially ET contacts!Did he have indirect contact with ETs?Did he almost market a working man-made saucer-shaped aircraft which flies better than any current aircraft?Read it to find out!"
4,Music for a dark theatre,"Unlike their other works, this is really a soundtrack for a theatre production. Has extended moments of grunting, wailing and banging away that you would expect from a sonic interpretation of Macbeth. Interspersed are some nice pieces, some suggestive of dank depression and Smetana's rousing Ma Vlast.I would also suggest Laibach's Baptism (a paraphrase of a much longer title in another language). It is from another theatre/dance production which is much more varied than Macbeth. It deals with the Laibach's perennial issues of Europe and nationhood, and it's quite good. It reminds me a little of the movie Europa in a sense. (It doesn't seem to be listed here)"
3,Dry but Complete Review of a Great Aircraft,"Fairly technical review of the F-4. Would recommend other works such as ""Threshold: A Blue Angels Experience"", SkyfireVideo's, ""Phantom"", and the book, ""Phantoms and Angels"" for more exciting narratives and visual spectacles."
1,The genesis prayer,"interesting old prayer. G-d does not do what you want by simply reciting a prayer. This book is offensive in it's premise, that we can call a taxi by reciting a prayer! Those who are not Jewish should also not be using this prayer and simply follow Noahic principles of right and wrong!!"
2,Using an ancient spiritual tradition to hail a cab?,"I'm feeling like a sucker again. I just purchased this book in yet another attempt at wish fulfillment. But what could I do? The first paragraph practically promises you the world! Well, that remaims to be seen. I'll check back in a week or two after I've finished the book to let you know if anything miraculous happens."
3,the classic triangle in orient style,The story can be read as a prelude to Jim et Jules. Two man love the same women yet in a completely reversed way. The first (the husband) loves her by giving complete freedom. The second loves her as an idol. The woman is in a way forced to this idolation because of the freedom she had received.The intelligent story can push the right buttons on human spirit to silence it. In an other perspective the book is a cry against nationalism.
5,Mind Blown.,"Every time I read one of these books it changes my perspective. Somehow Wilson constantly manages to bring up concepts that convict me and force me to look in, as well as over my shoulder."
3,Leona Naess doesn't fail to impress,"My allocation of three stars to Leona's debut might not appear to corroborate the title of this review, but in my own music dictionary, three out of five is pretty good. Yes, after hearing of Leona's comparisons to Fiona Apple and Tori Amos, I hurriedly placed my order. What I received in the post matched my expectations somewhat, as Leona's sultry vocals were indeed reminiscent of such artists, but unfortunately they lacked the intense and melancholy mood that I hold so dear. Having said that, 'Paper Thin' is wonderfully depressing, and 'Charm Attack' exudes energy that will brighten up a blue day. Look out for the impressive and creative sleeve notes."
1,Charming,"I totally dig this song on the radio that after hearing ""Charm Attack"", I searched for the cd and the artist. I bought the record 2 days after, hoping that there would be at least 3 songs that is worth my time. Obviously, ""Charm Attack"" is a stand alone hit track and would advise-if u truly like this one-to buy the single. The other songs are I suppose ok, however, not worth the money."
5,good stuff,"naess is a siren. her music is reminiscent of belly, the breeders, texas...i can even hear a little pj harvey. but other than these tiny hints of other artists...she has a style all her own. her voice is absolutely beautiful; she can rock out, and her ballads are pure gold. her melodies are unpredictable and the album itself works like a passionate day of adventure."
4,A wonderful debut,"Leona Naess is a star. Sure, you may not have heard of her yet, but it is undisputable. One only has to listen to the assuredness of the singing and songwriting on this, her debut album, to know it. One minute she sounds like Rickie Lee Jones; jazzy and dizzy; and the next she's rocking like a happier Fiona Apple. The songs are there too, which, lets face it is more than can be said for most of today's ""stars."" Lets hope this is the first of many wonderful albums. Go on... you owe it to yourself to give it a try."
4,Hard to believe,"The only problem with Leona Naess is that she robs me of adjectives to use to describe her incredible music. To listen to some critics one would think that Leona is good now but used to be mediocre. This could not be further from the truth. ""Comatised"" is a stunning debut from an extraordinary talent. Why this cd wasn't as big or bigger than AM's ""Jagged Little Pill"" is inconceivable. ""Charm Attack"" and ""Anything"" are equally powerful tracks, there is something wonderful going on here. ""Lonely Boy"" blew me away, to the point I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it was so darned (stronger language warranted, wary of Amazon editors) good. More uneven than her most recent or ""I Tried to Rock You,"" it goes without saying that this is a must have for Naess fans, and would be a good introduction to Leona's music for new listeners. If you think this one is good, I say to you, wait until you hear her others."
3,Lazy Days,"I bought this CD after hdearing it I immediately fell in love with the song, you could say i became addicted. So I bought the CD and I pretty much overall enjoyed it. It's a good thing to listen to when you're cleaning or hanging out with friends, but don't listen to it first thing in the morning when you're getting ready for school cuz it'll make you wanna lounge around!"
3,A Depressing Story,Mrs. Bridge is one of the most depressing characters I have ever encountered. The poor lady was so concerned about what her social peers might think that whatever unique personal qualities she might have been born with were gradually worn away. I doubt that life in prosperous Mid-Western suburbs is quite as bleak as Connell describes.
5,"Read this before ""Mr. Bridge""","An crystallized moment-in-time novel whose message has only grown in importance. Exquisitly written, with ""Mr. Bridge"" as almost an afterthought and frankly an appendix that wasn't really necessary. Mrs. Bridge stands by herself, ironically, because she's seen as less than half of the married couple.Things are calm in Mrs. Bridge's segregated, upscale Kansas City, but over the horizon, ever so subtly suggested, are the social conflicts and individual dilemmas that will define the second half of the century. Race, social class, and war loom in the distance, but the Bridges and their community are determined to remain the masters of events. The question is raised, have they, in their isolation, lost the knowledge necessary to maintain this distance? You can imagine the answer.This is not a novel of hard-biting social criticism, but is more relevant because of that. Connell is not sympathetic to his subject, but he reminds us that she too is a victim."
1,Couldn't get into it,Didn't work for me although I kept trying. I finally gave up the fight and put it away. Perhaps just not to my taste.
2,What Next?,"Will Mrs. Bridge figure out how to take off her big warm fur coat by herself, crawl over the front seat, roll down the windows and scream her doltish head off or even squeeze herself out one of the windows? That wouldnt be like her at all."
5,Almost their best!,"This was a great over looked album, as most Great White albums were! ""Almost"" only because ""Can't Get There From Here"" IS the best! This is a close second though!"
3,Yellow cd.,To be honest I bought this cd because I was looking for the song with Shirley Bassey for ever.... Don`t get me wrong .. I think YELLOW is a good band but my favorite was the Shirley Bassey song and since it was only about 7 dollars I thought it was a good deal.
3,Ferris Beulers Adventure,"I bought this cd since I liked the song that I heard on the above movie, I don't know how to spell it correctly, but, the song was played when the principal was walking beside the school bus after been attacked by a dog, and when the bus driver askes the pricipal if he wants a lift. It's funny, you sometimes remember the song as a different form, until you listen to it again. This sound track is great if you want to use it as Intro music for a school auditorum if you are in A/V. This group makes noises with their body. One song has a guy that sniffs his nose once in a while, on one of the songs, I don't know why. I liked the Oh Yeah songe, but, the rest are okay. Make sure that you preview them before making a final decision. But, I bought it for the Oh Yeah Song."
3,not too sure,"sure, the techniques in this book are gd and easy 4 kids, but the interior is pretty ugly to me, no offense.not very motivating.."
5,Inspiring account of illness overcome by faith,"Mr. Bedard offers an inspirational account of his battle with acute myeloid leukemia. He weaves the story of his illness into the context of his faith, Zen Buddhism. Mr. Bedard clearly explains how Buddhist practice allowed him to confront his disease and eventually find relief. ""Lotus in the Fire"" is not a purely religious account, however. These experiences transcend any one religious conviction, and anyone who has experienced pain or seen a loved one fight with illness and death will identify closely with the characters. I was riveted by the story told in these pages, and was unable to put the book down until I had reached its satisfactory closure. Absolutely, READ THIS BOOK!"
3,Once an excellent source of information,"For the first ten years after publication, this compendium contained up-to-date information. It remains a concise and nicely edited/condensed resource of a large variety of scientific data. It has been a great resource for years but is need of updating. A great deal of change has occurred in the scientific community in almost forty years since publication. Nomenclature has changed and different measures are now in use. For example, in the radiation section there is no mention of Bequels (Bq)or Sieverts (Sv)which are now in common use and, therefore, no formulae to relate these measures to rem, rads or Curies. The statistics section is great but, again, out of date. In spite of being out of date, however, the book remains a great and concise collection of scientific information not found in similar format or scope anywhere else."
4,Pills Great-Shipping Costly,I searched everywhere for these pills in the larger quantity bottle to bring down the cost per/pill...and it was a great price....but then the shipping cost from the actual supplier (not Amazon)was too high & really defeated the idea of saving by ordering a larger qty.
3,Hard to find!,"All I can say is: these are hard to find, especially if you need them quickly. I was forced to buy a case of 6000 in order to get them in time. I bought a Bostitch F21PL Round Head 1-1/2-Inch to 3-1/2-Inch Framing Nailer with Positive Placement Tip and it works very nicely buy I had no clue that the 21 degree nails are harder to find, especially at the big box outlets."
5,I Enjoyed this Book,"I kind of have a left field sense of humor, I found the Darryl parolee character to be most amuzing, his crack addiction and how he talks about ""You dont know about me and my Mentality"" it was just very funny to me. Seems a few arent to crazy about the book and had to put it down, for me it was the opposite. I laghed pretty hard at times."
5,"Funny, exciting and all too real!","Slow Motion Riot is one of the best books I've read in the last two years. The story is terryfying and doesn't let go of you for a second. Best part about it is the note perfect dialogue of the characters. Really a good, good book. Some of the images Blauner depicts will stay with me for a long time. I will definitely read it again!"
2,Slow Motion Riot Is Just That: Slow Motion,"The author of this work was what drew me to this title. Peter Blauner wrote The Intruder and I absolutely loved that book. This book however leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The characters are not drawn out very well and the story drags on forever. Many of the players in this book are not needed and just prolong the agony of the reading. The end, although exciting, could have been better. All in all this a book that I have to say would be better if skipped."
2,Sucked in by review blurbs...,"This book ruined a perfectly good plane ride. I felt ripped off by the two pages of blurbmeister babble. It's fine for a novel to be 'dark' but this was ridiculous. I was actually interested in the world of probation, but I am unconvinced that I know ANYTHING more or better about it."
2,well researched but racist,"Coming from a journalism backround as the author does, it's clear he did his research. there is much interesting detail about being a probation officer. But the author's depiction of the black underclass is definitely an outsider's view, cliched verging on racist. I have no problem per se with white writers creating black characters (or vice versa), but the proof is in the pudding. You can either do it convincingly, with insight and compassion, or you can't. This writer can't (or at least he doesn't in this book)."
1,Cheaper on David's Bridal,"I was about to buy this... and then I realized it looked EXACTLY like a product I saw on David's Bridal. On closer inspection, it WAS the exact same thing (DB#8949) and $10 cheaper on DB. Just so everyone knows."
4,Here On Time,"I got it before I needed it for class, and that is definitely convenient. The book is also in really good shape. Thanks."
1,Book Not Readable,"Save your $0.99! This is an unreadable edition of a great book. After opening my wirelessly delivered copy, I found the following:TIIK Hubjtwl mutter of this book was first broached i the brain of Lfibuix, who, in thn dwHortation, written in his twenty-third yiwr, o the woilt .....And so it continues, page after page. This from a product ""optimized for my Kindle""? It reads like a Robert Benchley parody of Old English.I obviously will not sue Amazon to recover my $0.99, but I will advise others to not buy this edition of Keynes excellent book."
3,Historically important ... but.,"The author introduces key concepts for the first time. He also introduces some ideas that I had not seen before. The book is historically important. However, the author's writing style is very much a product of his time - obviously brevity was not considered a virtue. The book is really, painfully long. If you are a historian, great. If you are looking for key concepts in statistical theory, there are other books that will get to the point much quicker."
2,"Not Famous, for a reason","Keynes is famous for economics. This book is afairly well written introduction to probability,but there are many other books which I wouldrecommend above it.If you want to read Keynes, you might startwith ""Essays in Persuasion""."
5,A must own!,"What a treat! Domingo was owning this...voice powerful, presence exactly right, and acting surprising excellent. Fleming was brilliant! Her voice was at the height of it's beauty. The last aria was so moving and perfect. While I didn't care for Morris's voice in this, I thought that he perfectly portrayed the character. And his second act with Domingo took this to this to another level. It left me breathless. The last act was so moving it brought me to tears. The pace was perfect throughout, and builds to a fantastic climax.I'll probably never get to see Domingo perform this live...but this is a wonderful record of a role that he totally owned.Bravo!"
4,Excellent within the limits of the medium,"The grandeur of Verdi's late operas cannot be adequately captured on a video screen. To some extent the closeups compensate for what one loses of the spatial reality of the theater. In this DVD from the MET the cast is uniformly fine. All the cast members are musically assured so that they are free to act their roles to the hilt. They truly ""live"" their roles.Domingo is superb as the moor. Fleming, captured before her more mannered recent work, is luscious to hear and to see. Morris is less convincing, not because he doesn't act or sing well but because he simply doesn't look very malevolent...this is where the closeups undercut the theaterical world of illusion.The opportunity to see this great work live in an opera house doesn't happen too often and its unlikely that one could run into as strong a cast as appears in this performance. We must be grateful that the opera is available to us in this form."
3,Otello/Domingo/Met production DVD,"I have a lot of respect for the reviewer who has seen Domingo singing this role live dozens of times. Having said that, I admit that no DVD compares to a live performance, and to me this DVD (when compared to the version of Domingo/Frittoli/Muti/La Scala) failed to capture a lot of the overwhelming sound effects such as that of the chorus singing full blast or the low register rumblings in the initial scene ""Una vela"". I don't know if it's a balance problem in the film making, editing or Levine's own judgment. The Met orchestra itself sounds great, but I would recommend buying the version with Muti and La Scala, instead. There the brass can get out of tune sometimes, but Muti's tempi are more convincing and the sound of the DVD is a lot richer and more complete. Finally, I'm only a violinist, but to me Frittoli is also better than Te Kanawa or Fleming in this role. Just my 2 cents."
4,The car....he ate my chicken!!!,"Some of the other reviewers said this movies was bad. I'll just say it could have been better. Yes, I am one of those ""diehard fans"", but this movie really was funny.The worst thing about the movie was definatly that kid. He was so freakin' annoying I wanted to slap him. As hard as possible. Also, the character of Pete Standcheck seemed a bit bland (he was easy on the eyes though :)). But there were so many eccentric personalities in the film that more than compensate for the one weak character.Overall, it was a highly original and amusing film. Aunt Louise and that whacky captain provided many hilarious moments. The film ends without letting us see the race. If they'd only lost that stupid kid and let us see the race this film would have been much better."
3,The Love Bug Roundabout,"May I suggest investing in The Love Bug Complete Collection including four movies, and extra disc for first film. This feature here is equal to the Monte Carlo version as being one of the silliest, but if you could groove to the TV series The Love Boat, you won't have a problem digesting this far from serious version of the great Disney Love Bug series."
4,"Herbie Goes Banannas,","Herbie is back in this fun filled movie. I have liked most of the herbie films but i think this one could of been better. in this film it seems they took herbies personality a little bit sour. He dosen't seem the same happy little Bug that we all know. Don't get me wrong i like it but it could of been better.Plot: Jim Douglas the previous owner of Herbie gives Herbie to his nephew. When Jims nephew picks up herbie then the fun starts. Herbie runs into this mexican child who is a pocket theif. the child accidently steals a important piece of papper from some very bad men. And now the men are after him, the child hitches a ride with herbie and they go on a little tour. Can herbie protect this child and stop the villians. Well you know what to do, Rent the movie and find out.If you liked this movie check out the other Herbie Films1. The Love Bug2. Herbie Rides Again3. Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo4. Herbie Fully Loaded"
2,The End Of The Road,"The fourth and final instalment of Walt Disneys Herbie and easily the worst and most forgetable. Though there are some beautiful shots of South America along the way this merley proceeds to make up for the holes in the plot. Whilst Herbie Goes Bananas certainly has a few bright spots, the film as a whole is a rather nondescript affair which sees Herbie the Volkswagen Beatle car, with a mind of its own, rubbing bumpers with a gang of smugglers on their way to Brazil. The stars in the film include Cloris Leachman as Aunt Louise, Charles Martin Smith as Dave Smith, John Vernon as Prindle and Stephan W Burns as Pete Stanchek. Strictly for die-hard fans of the series."
3,Herbie's last film fizzles out......,"In this last installment of the Love Bug series Pete Stancheck, the nephew of Jim Douglas, and his friend D.J., make a trip down to Central America to pick up Douglas' VW. The movie's plot basically gets boring after this, as the two travel by boat to Rio to enter a race. Charles Martin Smith makes a humorous cameo, but by the end of the movie, you're half asleep......"
4,gainsbourg jazz!!!!!!,"Jazzy songs are selected from few albums from 1958 to 1964. Some are recorded by trio including Elek Bacsik on guitar and Michel Gaudry on double bass. You can find some intrumentals too, like Angoisse, Black March {from movie L'Eau à la Bouche},...My favourite song from this album is Black Trombone.Put it on, open some wine, invite the girl, and you're gonna have an unforgettable evening.Believe me...."
1,Two American girls are lured into a vampire's Romanian lair,"'Peter Saxon' was a name used by several British horror writers, usually to continue a series about the Guardians, people who safeguarded Britain from black magic. This one was written by either Martin Thomas or W. Howard Baker, depending on which website you consult.Brits Mike Mills and Penny Cord become involved in the misadventures of two Americans - pretty, dangerous Laura Dasart and her plain-jane friend Hilde Schultze - as they explore the wintry mountains of Transylvania. The Americans seem strangely, self-destructively drawn to a ruined castle, and horror."
4,Great Price! Great Product!,Bought these for my son for Christmas and he loves them. Did not pay very much for them so wasn't expecting a great quality: boy was I surprised. I would definetly recommend to anyone! Thank you!
4,Jerzees Polo,"I would recommend this product, though the material is a little thin. It was very reasonably price though, so this was expected."
4,red shirt,"very red, fits okay,collar a little stiff at first but now it's better after it has been washed a couple of times"
4,Happy with my new shirts,"I bought these shirts for work and I am very happy with them. I go through shirts quickly so I like that these are inexpensive and still pretty well made. They did shrink and fade a bit, but I have washed them in warm water every time and I also always put them in the dryer. I will definitely be ordering more in the future."
4,Good shirt for the money,"Well constructed shirt for the money, but not the knit mesh common in many polo shirts, but for this amount what do you expect; still a great buy."
5,Review of- A quiet World: Living with Hearing Loss,This product was delievered on my Kindle immediately and was exactly what I expected. Very prompt. Would buy from them again.
4,Hypnotic! Just can't stop listening to this.,"I borrowed this CD from the library and have been listening to it over and over and over...needless to say, I'm going to buy it! I give Herbie a lot of credit for venturing into this area even though it's not jazz, even though his critics keep reminding him (and us) of his days with Miles. Buy it!"
3,works as described,"This product is sufficient for my needs. Pay attention to your peripheral's power needs. A little overpriced when you look at the overall changes in component manufacturing. Paying for a name? Boo. And, the so called ""internal weight and stay-put pads to keep it upright and anchored"" is hooey. The smallest cord can flip it over."
3,"Good, but bad AC adapter","Owned this hub for about 1 month, AC adapted died. I don't know at what point it happened, I suspect it was due to a recent power failure. The hub itself still works as long as you don't need it to be externally powered, which I do pretty frequently for plugging in portable hard drives, so I'm disappointed that the adapter failed so easily. On a positive note, the hub is backed by a lifetime warranty, and the Belkin online RMA process is quick and easy, so I should be receiving a replacement hub this week.Aside from that, the hub seems to be assembled fairly decently, though not as well as a few earlier belkin products i've owned. The LED indicator lights are subtle which is something I appreciate since I really only want to see them for troubleshooting. The cable management sleeve is a nice touch, as are the rubber strips on the bottom.So minus one star for construction quality and minus one star for the adapter failure."
3,Good product but unable to charge iPhone or iPad,I would have given this product 5 stars but the reason that I purchased it was to consolidate my charging needs. An once I opened it plugged the dock into power and plugged in my iPhone charging cable it would not charge the Device. Even if this was the only device plugged into the hub it would not charge the iPhone. I was very surprised by this because after all the USB hub was plugged into the wall and had AC power but it would not charge it. I could charge by Kindle Fire and some other smaller devices but no iPhone.
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this hub because I needed a simple output for my Macbook and this looked like a cool hub. First, the color is black, not brown and it throws off the entire looks of it. My jump drive worked on top, but not on the side port unless it was plugged in. Not very convenient (for a jump drive). Same as for my ipod. One hub worked and others didn't. It's going back and I'll try the 7-port."
1,YOU TAKE YOUR CHANCES,"I was quite pleased with the overall design of this 4 port hub; it has a small footprint, is handsome, and has a firm grip on the cables that feed it. After 8 months, though, the unit began to intermittently cut out it's connection and eventually failed. I never needed the included power unit, so the problem was not due to over-heating, just poor internal construction. Reviews of Belkin hubs vary, and I am sorry to report mine comes down on the side of concluding this to be an unreliable product."
5,Does Exactly what I wanted it to do,Not much to say. I needed a small powered USB hub and this fits the bill. Works great and charges my multiple devices while on the road.
2,Better books are out there,"I have been working for a number of years teaching primatology courses, and find this text to be dead last in the list of ones I might choose to assign to my students. If one has little respect for the undergraduate students to whom one is teaching primatology, then it might be OK, but some professors take their jobs seriously. It is a bit light on science, has nice pictures with cutsey captions, and frankly shows an atypical lack of modesty for a scientist in that the author has had herself drawn as the model human in all her cladograms. Whether this book is poor because the author does not believe college students to be capable of comprehending a worthy text (like that of John Fleagle), or because she does not understand theory-driven issues herself is not clear, but in later editions more attention needs to be paid to issues scientific relevance.More effort needed on this one before it is passable."
2,A sad book,"This book was okay, but a grave disappointment from Monica Hughes. It is a story of two children, in a world without water, who walk across the Canadian prairies to find their uncle. The story tells of how thirsty they are, and how exciting it is to put one foot in front of the other."
4,Great for movement drawing,"Wonderful book. On almost every page, I find at least three or four poses worthy of drawing.This volume focuses on what seem to be dance-like movments, mostly done a level perspective.I do have one complaint, which is the print quality of the pictures is a little grainy. This is of course due to the film speed required to capture clear movements, but the processing probably could have been done a little better.However, the graininess of the images does not detract from usability of this book. Excellent variety with capable models expressing a wide range of body language. Overall, an excellent reference."
5,Great Help!,"For the life of me, I could not understand how and why some colors worked with others while others didn't. This book showed very clearly and explained the reasons behind it using many masters of color theory to get the point across."
4,An excellent place to start!,"In design and illustration it can often be all to easy to overlook the important basics such as colour. This excellent book from Rockport takes you through the basics, to some more complex ideas and has plenty of high quality product examples. For people like me who didn't go to art college this sort of reference is a must."
4,Good basic book on color.,This book was a good basic book on color. I feel that there are better books out there that go more into color theory and I'm in the process of looking for those. Overall this book is great for beginning graphic design professionals.
3,Error on Page 10,"I have had this book for a while, to look at the pictures. I chose to sit and read it this morning. On page 10, while the graphic is correct, there is an error in the description of Additive Mixing. The text reads""...red and blue light form cyan...green and blue light form magenta"". It is a beautiful book, but that should have been caught in editing."
4,Colorful,"I have started reading this book, so be warned.My initial reaction is that it is a very good survey of color, the author(s) do a good enough job introducing color.What I disagree with is their recommendation for color systems, but that's a personal opinion. As more and more people use the computer and (Adobe) software for color correction, I would tend towards the rbg + cmy color wheel.Everything else I read is, like I said, a good introduction."
3,CERTAINLY NOT MOBY'S BEST ACHIEVEMENT,"Okay, Moby is one of my favourite artists. And ANIMAL RIGHTS is a pretty good album, especially if you can get the Limited Edition version with the LITTLE IDIOT CD. The problem is, in my opinion, that COME ON BABY is the worst track on ANIMAL RIGHTS. Why it was released as a single is beyond me. The remixes are (thankfully) an improvement. Which is good.Don't read too much into the ""Death Metal"" version of WHIP IT, because it doesn't resemble Death Metal in any shape or form. It's still a pretty good track though.The great thing about this single (yes, there is a great thing about it), even though they sound a little raw, are the live versions of GO and ALL THAT I NEED IS TO BE LOVED (which actually combines a little of WHAT LOVE). It's hard to believe that GO can be played as a hard rock track, but Moby pulls it off very well. And ATINITBL is great with the volume cranked right up.This is probably only for those of you who are like me: Rabid Moby fans."
1,Inkslinger,I have finished reviewing and learning(?) from this tutorial. I did not learn much and it is my humble opinion that this product is overpriced. There is one procedure she mentioned that troubled me very much. That is that a technician can go over a line as much as 12 times. Ouch! WRONG. Don't go over two times. Three max. This particular procedure is not recommended as you can and will butcher the client.Before and after pictures were not available for comparison. Finished job details were not taken closeup so the student or learner can take note of. Some cautionary and informative notes were completely erronious and misleading (She said no more than one eyeliner line. I say two colors and two lines are very popular in my area of residence). Improper stretching of skin was demonstrated. Notice how ink dripped inside her eyeball.I do not recommend this video because it is not much informative for the hefty price tag.
2,It was OK,I think this was over priced for the video this woman put together. It didn't talk about a lot of important things like the sizes and types of needles that were used. It was not very well done at all.
5,Great DVD!,"I have read all of Debbie's books and seen all of her DVD's and I currently use her products. This DVD answered many questions that I had on my permanent make up procedures. How to measure, sizes of the needles she uses and the steps for start to finish on eyebrows, eyeliner and lips!!! Plus it seems really professionally done. I would recomend this DVD to anyone!!"
2,Still Getting Over the Shock,"When purchasing music I always preview CDs at stores. However, since I've been a long time Boyz II Men fan I had so much faith in the group that I didn't feel the need to so. How wrong I was! I was so disappointed! This album put them with the likes of O-Town! I know that each of the men are exceptionally talented so I don't know what went wrong. If they released this album just to make some cash, I would have gladly dug into my pockets and donated money rather than listening to an album that does them no justice."
2,Horrible,I'am a big Boyz II Men fan with Michael not part of the group they don't have the classic sound they once had...
3,The cd is not bad,"The cd is not bad, but I think most of us die-hard fans have a hard time accepting the group's evolution. We must, however, also realize that it's typically not easy marketing music to an over-30 audience. These guys are now in their early 30s, and attempting to make their mark(s) as independent musicians. I, too, miss the ballads and harmonies that initially attracted the Boyz II Men fanbase; but this is not a bad cd. Afterall, Wanya still displays his unbelieveable vocal maturity and control, Shawn is smooth as ever, and Nathan still holds the harmonies together. I'm loking forward to an original presentation, though. These guys are WAY too talented and gifted to have to rely on remakes to get them back into the mainstream."
3,Tired Old Act,You know a group is in trouble when they do a ablbum of cover songs. I mean lets face it when was there last big hit? Although its my favorite boys 2 men album Evolution wasnt a major sucess. So that takes us back to there 2nd album as there last big work. Thats nilly 10 years ago back when they had decent writers for there songs and not themselves as evident by the flop there 4th ablum became. Although these may be good covers in the end thats all they will ever be is covers and its a shame to see these guys fall out like this.
2,Unexpected Dissappointment,"Boyz 2 Men have undeniably the best voices in the industry and to see them make a comeback was the nicest surprise of 2004, but on first hearing this new album all i could say was that it's been somewhat of a dissapointment, mediocre balllads seemed to dominate the album. With the exception of SARA SMILE this album is far from being their personal best, if listeners want a true classic B2M album , then may i suggest ""Evolution"" and undoubtedly their Greatest Hits album which was a consolidation of truly great hits."
1,Boyz II Men FAN,"A moment of silence please...cause this CD is HORRIBLE. I was very excited about this CD, but once you listen to it you will feel the same way. Songs like Human Nature are butchered, and others should have never been on the CD. If you have all of their other CDs you know the work that they are capable of."
2,Throw them back in time,"hard to beleive just ten years back this was the Hottest Act in the game.ten years later if Mr.Rourke from ""fantasy island"" granted them one wish I bet it would be making an Album of Hot Original material as to doing so-so takes at best on Classic material.while they still have good sounding Instruments vocally they still never took there game up.they were always Comfortable&that mind set robbed fans of some great works in time.this is ok for the Buppie/Yuppie dinner&drink set but at best it's background music that you gonna keep where you can hear it but also where you can forget about it.Throwback these cats Babyface&Jam&Lewis one more time. but while they are fully Grown they still ain't Grown enough to take these songs fully anyplace."
2,Whats with the anti copy software on this cd?,"The cd is fine, not bad, not great. I wanted to make a copy for work, so I can leave the original at home. Well this thing has some sort of copy protection on it. Which doesnt support Ipods, so I cant even rip the songs for my Ipod. This lame - I bought it and I cant do what I want with it. I cant even listen to it on my PC w/o installing that lame software. Terrible!"
4,Nice prelude to a new album,"Another album that will definitely be a classic. Though on some songs the vocals aren't as sharp and the production was not good on some tracks, others like ""Do for Love"" make up for it.But as one reviewer said, guys time for a new album. The industry of music needs it."
3,its about time,"it has been my opinion that this type of album from the fellas should have been done a long time ago. its about time they finally realize their target audience (or should i say coorperate finally realized it...lol) however i think something is missing from this album while the vocals are stupendous on this album (including the three that mike shows up on) in the begining of the album the production suffers...with the exception of cutie pie.... from the isley's for the love of you on till the end gets a 5 star raiting ...but we should have known that they would totally vibe on this sound from the song on full circle I got cha......this album would be excellent with a few original cuts like ""I gotcha"" and with a lil extra bonus like a remake of ""secret Garden""...but if you got a bar-b-que or a long drive planned it will definatley work you through it..."
4,Give It Some Time,"When you first pop this album into your CD player and press the play button, you will ask yourself, ""What kind of crap is this?"" Throwback is obviously different from all of Boyz II Men's other CDs. A lot of people at first will not like this CD at all. However, given some time, this CD will grow on you. You will enjoy this CD much more everytime you listen to it. The younger generations have no experience with old school music and of course will find the songs in Throwback very odd. They will end up giving it very low ratings because of something they are not use to without giving it the chance it deserves. Many are saying Throwback is crap and not a Boyz II Men type of CD, but what is wrong with change? Change is always good is it not? Give Throwback a chance and you will surely enjoy it."
1,Disappointed,Don't get me wrong I do love Boyz II Men. But this cd is one that they could have left on the shelf. I recommend that you listen to this cd before purchasing. In my opinion this cd is a HOT MESS. I understand how they went old school to show their talent but we already know that... I applaud them for trying but I don't recomment this at all.
4,Put the book down and get a life!,"A WOW book! Come on U guys! Grant it, Alan did a good job... but a WOW book? No way! If this book makes you say WOW... (Sigh) Guys, then you need to get a life! Put the book down and go out and smell the roses. Life is waiting for you.A book like this shouldn't make you say, wow with capital letters, ""life"" should.I agree with Helena...""not a WOW book."""
3,One person opinion,"This is not a ""WOW"" book. It is one man (Alan W. Brownlie) opinion of Thomas Pynchon books. But then again that is my opinion."
5,escape is the best rave song,this song is good for raving and also for when you just want to listin to music.i have it on recored and its good to mix into
4,Sublime T-shirt,"Product was not shipped within 24hrs. like they say, but I didget it in time for Christmas and was very happy with it.Great Product!"
5,So much camera for so little money!,"I bought this camera to replace my old Fuju A200. Having already owned a Fuji, I knew mostly what to expect in terms of quality, but the enormous leap forward from the A200 to this is like going from DOS to a fully integrated Windows environment. This camera is small - you can fit it in most pockets - but it can do almost all the things a fancier camera can. The digital zoom is great, and the internal settings which allow you to select different shooting conditions, ISOs, and even take video amazed me. The LCD is big enough to see clearly in most conditions and can be set brighter or darker as you need. I never once missed having a viewfinder. Honestly, I cannot think of anything bad to say about this camera. Try it, you'll LOVE it!"
2,Fujifilm Finepix A820,"The Finepix A820 I had took poor pictures, I was very dissapointed with this product. Maybe the unit I had was defective, your results may be better.I found that the auto focus was poor, in lower light conditions the auto focus was worthless. Pictures were not sharp despite the 8MP resolution, I feel that the Nikon 3200 (3MP) camera I have takes sharper pictures.I rarely return items, but this one went back ASAP."
2,upon further review,"i bought this camera in July and was immediately impressed. Now its 5 months later and it is starting to act up. The auto focus has become unpredictable and when you power up and down the camera is making a ""mechanical"" noise that is making me worried that one day it wont power up at all.I really thought this would be my last camera for a while but it seems that I'm back to shopping again."
2,Nuclear power required,"For the first 5-6 months, my 820 did fine with 2700mAh NiMH batteries. Suddenly, upon turn on, the empty battery icon flashes and it shuts down within 5 seconds. I am using the same batteries and even bought new ones. No deal. Sent it back to Fuji for repair. They sent it back with the same problem. It's a great camera otherwise. Lots of features and video w/sound. But now it just doesn't stay on long enough to use it. Alkalines will last only 8-10 minutes and less with flash. I'll try the repair route again. It might just be my camera's problem, but if you do buy it, don't get too emotionally attached."
4,Great book - worth your time if you are ISV or in High Tech,"This insightful book looks at how companies build a businesses on ""network effects"". The key case studies are MS, Intel and Cisco. If I had to summarize this book in 1 sentence: build a platform and a business model where multiple companies can add value and be profitable (constellation of ISVs, VARs and Service Providers). Book also covers NTT 3G, Palm, Linux.Case studies are analyzed on how they used the ""4 levers of Platform Leadership"": 1) Scope of Firm, 2) Product Technology/Architecture, 3) Relationships with external complementors, and 4) Internal Organization.Very well written."
4,An essential Sanskrit reference,"Sanskritists by training become immersed in historical linguistics and grammar. Speijer adds another dimension - syntax - to that training. To the best of my knowledge, it is rarely used as a class requirement but rather is suggested as an optional reference to second or third year students. He covers Classical, Vedic and Epic Sanskrit in six sections: (1) general remarks on the structure of sentences (2) syntax concord and case relationships (3) classes of nouns and pronouns (4) syntax of verbs (5) syntax of particles and (6) connection of sentences.A reference well worth its cost."
5,FILM FESTIVAL CARNIVOUS!,"Terorrists bother film-goers and critics at Cannes Film Festival. Best safe if you wear sunglasses (so to minimize your identity). '99 Oscars honoring Kazan has potential for ""...life to imitate art..."". Wouldn't that be cool? Let's GO!"
1,Don't Buy if you have Kids: Contains Lead,"The cord of this product contains lead. There is a warning on the box stating so and advising to wash hands after each use. This product should not be in homes where children are present. I'm returning mine immediately. Also, while it looks nice, this candle is very tippy and cheaply made."
1,They don't work very well!,"I've used three of these since receiving them, and two have already quit working. I replaced the fuses in both of them, and they still won't work."
3,Not sturdy enough on its own,"It works, but I had to tape it down because it kept toppling over. It's good enough for rooms you don't spend much time in or if its hidden by curtains."
3,Connery Superb In So-So Film,"To say ""The Offence"" is a disappointment would be an understatement. Any film starring Sean Connery and directed by Sidney Lumet that lacks any kind of resonance would be. Connery is not at fault here because he gives his all as a police inspector beoming unhinged through the combination of his experience and personal demons. His role harkens back to a similar one played by Clint Eastwood in the underrated ""Tightrope"". Where the film lets down is in the shockingly lackluster direction of Sidney Lumet and a script that doesn't evolve very far from it's stage origins. The key word here is staginess. Lumet didn't know how to open this film up for the big screen and it never really takes off. The film is watchable but with the material and the starpower on hand you wonder what might have been. This film is best recommended to Connery and Lumet afficienados and others beware."
3,Good little suspense thriller,"Three and a half stars. Well-acted thriller. Connery, who plays a disturbed policeman forced to face his demons, gives a brave performance, especially considering he could have spent the rest of his acting life making buckets of money playing 007 and nothing else. He stretches himself here and is given excellent support by the likes of Trevor Howard (who is a man, and does not play the wife as stated in an earlier review), Vivian Merchant (who does play Connery's wife) and especially Ian Bannen as the accused child molester. Lumet's direction occasionally borders on the murky (dark lighting, endless rain, mysterious flashbacks), but the actors come through. Worth seeing."
2,Low-grade Transfer on DVD-R,"Some of the MGM Limited Edition titles have been very nice, such as 99 RIVER STREET, but others like THE HAWAIIANS and THE SATAN BUG have been nearly unwatchable. This film, THE OFFENCE, isn't a total loss, but it has DVD authoring issues. Jerky motion artifacts on pans and lots of jaggies in the image. Color and contrast-wise the image looks great, it's just when characters (or the camera) move around that the image falls apart. Might not be too bad on a small television, but is a chore to sit through on a big screen."
3,Great Sean Connery Film,"This is from the MGM vault series. While it is not close-captioned for the hearing-impaired, it is presented (for the first time on DVD) in its original (theatrical) letter-boxed presentation of 1:85."
1,The worst,I bought this for my son because he loves popcorn. While the machine is running the popcorn or kernels shoots out at you. Its like playing dodge ball with it. It burned my son. I tried putting a taller bowl to see if it would help and still it shoots at you. I have only used it a couple of times. I will be buying something else that is safer for my family. I would not recommend this at all.
2,Not up to par for this excellent series.,"AN EXPERIMENT IN TREASON is a rather weak addition to this fine series. Basing the case on actual historical events involving Franklin and some rather interesting letters that became available for public consumption in the states; Alexander had a good idea, but the execution is lacking. Franklin comes off as a caracature of himself, a bit of an old lech, (which he may have been but I believe he may have been a bit more circumspect in an unfamiliar environment like Sir John's home.)who was rather lacking in the wit or the intellect that is so celebrated in many of his biographies. Even the tales involving Sir John's household were particularly weak, involving an unfortunate return of Lady Fielding's son from the navy. While I appear to be in the minority on this one; I feel this book is lacking the quality of mystery and character development that is the norm for Alexander's generally excellent historical mysteries."
3,Not his best,"The story ""An Experiement in Treason"" was by no means the best of the series. The story is a little slow and not much excitement is happening. The reader is left with little sympathy for the murder victim and thus not much interest in solving this crime.Benjamin Franklin is being portrayed as a bumbling fool who at best is just full of air. He was apparently terribly afraid of the magistrate, to be found in the worst of pubs, drinking and in the company of whores (several at a time!) and at other times making advances to an underage girl while eating at her guardians dinner table. His scientific experiements where foolish and, of course, did not amount to much. Even I, who is not an american citizen, must say, that Alexander seems to have a chip on his shoulder about this particular part of Anglo/American history. I loved almost all the other stories in this series."
4,Nice Entry,"This is the ninth entry in the Sir John Fielding mystery series and will be the penultimate as the author passed away earlier this year. There is a tenth, and last, book available.In the book, Fielding and his apprentice Jeremy Proctor are investigating the theft of some letters from the residence of a high-ranking official in London, an official that is dealing with the American colonies. The time period being pre-Revolutionary War means that the letters are related to the Americans creating problems. Benjamin Franklin appears and plays quite a major role in the book and I like the way the author fleshed out his character, showing both his genius and his faults (mainly his womanizing).While there is not a lot of action in this book, the period descriptions make up for that. As well, the furthering of Jeremy's personal relationships makes this one of the better and more interesting books in the series and that is saying a lot considering most of the series has been excellent."
4,Miss Lettie is for Me,"This film was produced by the cable channel TNT and having noted that one should not expect that the result is a bonafide theatrical release, but taken for what it is MISS LETTIE & ME is great tear-jerking, holiday entertainment. Holiday films are sappy, they are supposed to be because that is why we watch... Who would watch A CHRISTMAS CAROL if Scrooge made no kind of transformation?MISS LETTIE AND ME is the story of a family that is brought together by the unwanted intrusion of a young girl who needs to be wanted almost as badly as her great aunt needs to be needed. The players here are comfortable and in good form. Mary Tyler Moore and Burt Reynolds head up a talented cast and make a nice Christmas themed movie for the whole family."
4,"smooth, cheerful story",This movie was a refreshing breathe of clean air. The plot was believable. The acting was good to very good. I was particularly impressed by Charles Robinson. How many farm hands do you find who carry a high level of maturity along with seasoned wisdom and a gentle wit. The script writers did a good job. But Robinson deserves much credit for handling the part very skilfully.
2,This movie sucks,about a kid having to movie in with a grumpy old lady .the kid acts too hard to be cute so fake and dull.passola
4,"Great, Super Basic Pilates","I have avoided Pilates for a long time. My abs and neck are very weak. I have Leslie Sansone's video for Abs and like it, so I thought I'd try this one. Yes, it is a super basic pilates video, but I do like it. For someone who NEVER does pilates, but wants to try it, this is a good place to start. I know anyone who feels comfortable already with pilates probably won't like this video and will think it a verson for wimpy people, like me. But, I still like it. So, if you're looking for a simple abs workout, this will do the trick. I like Leslie's workouts because I get a good workout without putting strain on my knees or neck. I do get a good workout. But, I am averse to pain. So, if you think that describes you at all, too, then I'd try this video. If you are in great shape with a strong neck and abs, I'd look for another pilates video instead of this one."
3,Pilates for beginners,"Leslie Sansone has many exercise dvds, but I think this one is not for me.I find it too slow and boring, would rather be doing her walk slim and walk away the pounds. For someone who likes pilates, I am sure you will enjoy this dvd. But it is not for me."
4,Leslie Sansone Consistently Delivers,"Having purchased Ms. Sansone's walking videos, my expectations were high for her version of Pilates & she doesn't disappoint. I haven't been in town long enough to complete the entire workout; but feel as a beginner with some individualized instruction behind me, I'll be able to catch up soon. Definitely recommend."
3,Too difficult for a heavy person,"I think I'm just too heavy to do Pilates. The movements require a lot of strength and stability and my belly and flab just got in the way. Maybe once I lose a few pounds, this will be a great workout for me."
3,Good and Bad both...,"She's not as irritating as her walk videos (thank goodness!) but there are still a few issue - at first I thought it was going to be a really good basic video, with her explaining it all, etc..However - every exercise that she does give an ""easier"" way to do it, I have no problems doing at the more advanced level... but there are a lot of exercises that she doesn't tell how to modify - like if you literally can not do the roll up, what are you to do? What about the sissors? She doesn't say what to do if you can't come anywhere near your toes! She's not consistant on providing modifications..."
4,illusions,This book is very useful for younger children....the illustrations are perfect to pique their interest!
3,not bad....could be slightly better though,"I got this as a gift for my niece (she is 7 years old) and she loves it. The only thing that could be better is if the writing under each illusion was a little bit bigger and explained it a tad big better. All in all, this is still a lot of fun and well worth the money. It's got the classics (""is this a vase, or two faces?"") and its got ones I've never seen before (""how many babies are in this picture?""). If you like optical illusions, then you should get this book. I'm sure you'll like it."
3,so-so,"I was hoping for a larger book than this, but it is okay as is. Just not very much content. I do hope my great-nephew will get some enjoyment out of it."
5,"Difficult, but satisfying, book","I found this book difficult to read because of the historical accuracy of the story. The writing was incredibly vivid, often causing the disturbing images to literally come to life and spring off the pages. None the less, the writing's intense and accurate retelling of the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, was well served by this vivid and detailed style of writing. Within the book are woven first person narratives from different characters - each telling the current circumstances of war through their own eyes, and giving a bit of their personal history as well. Uriza Holthe imbues this personal history with realism, retelling actual Filipino folk tales and archetypal lore. The books ending is tragic but realistic and expected; the author braces the reader, throughout the book, to take the difficult and non-storybook ending. 'When Elephants Dance' is a worthwhile and ultimately, satisfying book."
4,Great writing and captured a great amount of emotion,"I thought that this book captured a lot of the Filipino culture of it. My parents were both born in the Phillipines and I could see a lot of them in the people of this book. My parents NEVER talk about the experiences that my family had during this time in history. I have heard whispering of stories and I can see now why they are things that they never talked about. A descriptive and emotional book, well-written and engrossing."
1,When Elephants Dance,Could not read it. Poor story line and too violent. there are too many good books to waste time reading about excessive misery.
3,Blame it on the Editor,"The people and their stories written of in this book are really wonderful. The impact of the Spanish, the Japanese, and the Americans is powerfully illustrated. Unfortunately, the wonderful stories (that make this a worthwhile read, even with some flaws) that take the reader into the past are connected by events in the present that do not live up to the colorful, well developed and interesting stories of the past. I was disappointed at the ending of the book which was predictable and trite. I finished the book and had an urge to re-write the ending. With better editing this could have been a fabulous book."
2,Great premise -disappointing writing,"I had great hopes for this book, but was disappointed enought that I didn't read the last third narrator. I'm not familiar with the history behind the story, but good historical fiction will put it all in perspective - this didn't. I did not like the first person narrator; at times the writing seemed very simplistic and just ""too direct"" as if the writer was telling me exactly what I was to be feeling. I can't comment on the accuracy of the language or customs, but did find the many foreign phrases troublesome. Overall, I think this could have been a really good story, but it just didn't deliver."
4,Funny,I would rate this as one of the top three funniest of the Pink Panther Movies. Alot of disguises in this one. Clouseau!
2,WOW WHAT A WASTE,This movie is patethetic with bad slapstick. It has very bad jokes execpt in a few parts towards the end.
5,INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU,no one beats peter sellers at his portrayl of the bumbling inspector. if you can't watch this and laugh you arevery depressed and i will pray for you.
4,revenge of the pink panther,movie arrived ahead of projected date...condition very good...very good cast made this movie one of the betterfilms in this series
4,Blundering Life,"Peter Sellers once again portrays the witty and incomparable Inspector Clouseau.The story begins when Chief Inspector Dreyfus(Herbert Lom) beleieves that Clouseau has died in an explosion that has devastated his apartment; however, Clouseau isreally alive and proceding to Hong Kong with Cato(Burt Kwouk) and a drug lord's(Robert Webber) ex-girlfriend(Dyan Canon). The situation begins to intensifywhen it is dicovered that Chief Inspector Dreyfus is on the case too. The cluelessClouseau proceeds unperturbed to everyone's amazement as he bumbles his way to anunwitty conclusion."
4,Classic Clouseau,"""Revenge of Pink Panther"" (1978) is the best of the later Inspector Clouseau comedies, with Peter Sellers and director-writer Blake Edwards providing some new wrinkles to a well-established formula. The welcome addition of Dyan Cannon as Clouseau's romantic interest, along with an expanded role for Burt Kwouk's Cato, adds to the fun. Happily, ""Revenge"" avoids the sadistic physical humor of the earlier sequels for a kinder, gentler comic approach. And watch for Sellers' dead-on imitation of Oliver Hardy during Clouseau's slapstick interlude with Cato."
2,poor panther,"this attempt resembles in several ways the problems of most sequels- no expansion on character, plot etc. Like Clouseau's michelin Corleone, this film is lazy, bloated and not very funny. For interest to die-hards, if only to see Sellers on the screen. What a descent from the first panther!"
2,[Two-and-a-half stars out of Four] Another bit down as Dyan Cannon adds little!,"Squeeling bleech blonde Lakers fan Cannonneeded the work and Sellers needed a'Kin-der Gentler' Panther movie to star in be-tween his 'Chance' movie in which he pla-yed a gardner who's whole view of the worldwas based on T.V., since he suffered his 4thheart attack, and this time it was a bad one.Not bad, funny and all but not much origin-ality left in the series. Time for LeslieNielsen as Chief Inspector Frank Drebin totake over these type films, w/ The Filesof Polic Squad, which borrows much from thePanther Series (rewatch the Naked Gun(s)soon again)."
3,Not One of My Favorite Panthers,"I was never really fond of this film, even though it was Peter Sellers' last portrayal of Inspector Clouseau. It started out excellent but slowly deteriorated into mundane and silly slapstick. By the time it reached Hong Kong I thought it was terrible. Even Henry Mancini's score seems a little tired in this one. It all seems like very forced filmmaking. I suppose some of the same things could be said about CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER but in that film the script follows a logical progression from the classic Clouseau skits to slapstick and finally into the absurd. It seemed to work wildly in that film. I actually found the scenes in TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER with Peter Sellers much funnier than in THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER. THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER remains a weak entry in the series for me."
5,Live tracks with orchestra,Tracks 2 -3 -4 are from a live show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London with a full orchestra. Magnificent.
2,Travel show,"I suppose if I were a fan of the show this would have been interesting, but I've never watched Rick Steves' travel show before so I didn't make it through the whole behind the scenes show before deleting."
2,Used Devotional bibles,"I was not pleased with the items because they were written into. when i am reading a book or a bible i don't want to the what the commemts of others were. wnnt to draw my own conclusions. For this reason I was un happy with my purchase. It was presented as almost new, and it was not so, also the image that was shown did not correspond to the product I received."
5,captivating,I love this album! It completly captures your mind and makes the world around you feel so calm and relaxed. I put the album on when I am at home and get lost in the amazing sounds that have been put together so beautifully. I would definetly recommend this album to anyone and everyone!
3,"Great product, but doesn't stay connected to my ipod","When I get this product plugged in and working-- it's great. I can usually find a station where there is minimal noise and it works very well. I really like how I can plug it into the car's power adapter and charge my ipod while it's playing.However, the dock doesn't ""click"" into my ipod, and therefore falls out all the time. I even put my ipod upside down in my cup holder, and if I hit a tiny bump, it disconnects and I have to fiddle with it to get it back connected to my radio station.I don't know if mine is defective or what-- but that's my experience with the product.Oh-- and I also like how I can use it with any stereo. I just with that it came with a wall outlet adapter as well."
4,"not perfect, but it certainly does the job!","i recently bought this item, and even though it isn't perfect, it is pretty good. you are able to listen to your tunes in your car without the hassle of changing cds every hour. i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys listening to their ipod in the car.** it is easy to use!"
2,"Well Designed, too low power FM","This device seems to be well designed and integrated well with my ipod for the few hours I tried it out, but it did not perform up to my expectations. The FM transmitter just does not have enough power to work well in my car. I will be better off sticking with a tape adapter. I returned this item as I couldn't stand the static when using a frequency with nothing neighboring it on either side."
3,"Great Reception, faulty product","I ordered this product after reading a lot of possitive reviews and found that the reviews were correct, it was a lot better at getting a clear sound in then any other product i had tried. Its car hookup worked very well and while it did drain the ipods battery it wasnt anything that i couldnt deal with. There was however a defect in my particular model where i heard a squeel when i used it and after calling technical support i decided that it was particular to my product and i ended up returning it. So, if i am correct in my assumption that it was just my particular one that had that defect then id deffinetly recomend this to anyone looking for a high quality ipod transmitter and wish them better luck in theirs."
3,product,It's the standard product for a reasonable price. I am disabled and it's nice to know that you can still get this service without having to leave the house.
1,Awful,"Agree with other reviewers, very difficult to put together. Completely idiotic to have square peg to go in small round hole (how on earth did that get manufacturing approval?).Finally managed to make it work (bend clip, luckily dosen't break) and force and wiggle! However, even the clip dosen't hold normal tubing well at all.I actually thought I had bought a defective product until I checked it out other reviews on amazon!"
1,You Have To Be Innovative With These Things,"These are a great and cheap way to keep your air stones in place, HOWEVER, if you purchase them you will have to use a knife to shave some of the plastic out of the hole (very easy to do since the plastic is very soft. Took me less than three seconds) but after you do that the pegs will fit into the holes no problem."
3,"Still Sheisty, Part 2","This book was alright. I think it was a bit drawn out. The 2 books Shiesty and Still Sheisty, could've just been combined into one book."
4,"Good Read but Very Disappointing Ending,","This book was a good read! It captured my attention and kept it from beginning to end! Events that took place in this book you would have never guessed it would have happened that way! My favorite character in this book was Keisha I am very disappointed that she ended up dying in the end because of Epiphany's stupidity, I really felt bad for Tucker & wished that him & Keisha could have gotten a chance at a fresh start!!! Overall still sheisty was great book! & if you like this book you definitely would enjoy Side Chic 1&2 by La'Tonya West!!"
2,Still Sheisty 2,Ok it started out to be a good read for me but in the end I became pissed off. Keisha did what she did in the first of this book but why in the h*** did she have to die for what Epiphany did to Smitty ! Come on now ! And is it just my book or did the end say that a independent film entitled ' SHEISTY ' coming soon ! W.T.F I'm a reader of all fiction but come on now give me a break on this book. WAIT THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED SHEISTY ! GLAD I GOT IT FROM THE LIBRARY AND NOT SPEND MY MONEY ON IT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE WANTED A REFUND !
5,what i tell you!!,"I put it on everything that on ""Sheisty"" you found yourself saying ""oh no she didn't or holding your breath for what would happen next. Still Sheisty is even better. You think you know what will happen next but you have no clue. For real."
4,It was ok,"I read part one and just had to get part two still love the characters just hated how Keisha had to go out when she was the one trying to turn her life around. E still didn't learn from getting shoot at and all. Glad that Shana moved on even though I wouldn't have took K.C butt back. But, I will give part two a OK and 4 stars just wished that they edited the book a little bit I had to fill in the blanks where words was missing."
3,Too shiesty for words!,"I had to take away a star for the proofreading because it doesn't seem like there was any done to this book. But what really ticked me off was Keisha's so called friend Lea aka Leanne who really did a doobie on her. Not only did she set her up, she stole her man, moved into her house and bragged about what she did to Keisha on the phone. The worse part about it was when she beat the child for no reason because she wanted to be #1. The ending was kind of sad because Keisha was trying to do the right thing even though her stupidity in intrusting someone especially a female with all her personal business really messed up her life. Epiphony got her memory back but caused the demise of her friend. Shana got busted. But it seems that maybe the ending is happy for most of the people in the book."
4,"About Still Sheisty, Part 2",This book was a lil longer than the first of course but I also enjoyed reading this book!
2,Hard To Finish,"This book was tough to finish. I was disappointed. I kept putting it down then coming back to it and reading 1 page here, 1 page there. It was not a great read. It was not one of the best books I have read. The one good thing was that the story is now complete."
4,That book was so catching.....,After I read sheisty part 1 I had to go and get part two. That was the best sequel I ever read. I really didn't like how it ended that is why i took away a star....I kinda like happy endings. A movie should be made for part I and part II
3,Still Poorly Edited!,"Where in the heck is an editor when you need one? Still Sheisty made for an alright read as it was just as predictable as is predecessor ""Sheisty"". Ephipany didn't learn a dog gone thing from her brush with death. Keisha's unfortunate mistake had you feeling her pain as T dogged her to the fullest. Shana was as dumb as they come accepting any pitiful excuse K.C. came up with. C-God quickly dwindled to a hot funky mess getting high off his own supply. Overall this book tells the story of how you can be own top of the world in the rapidly evolving drug game only to have it snatched away from you by the next best kingpin. Gold Diggers that read this book should take heed to the message that guys want someone with a good head on their shoulders & ambition, not someone that can only give good head to get a shopping spree. If you think otherwise, YOU ARE Ephiphany, Keisha & Shana."
4,Still Shiesty,Still Shiesty is a good book. I enjoyed every bite of it and wasn't able to put it down. I want to shout out the Triple Crown Authors for writing great books that are edgy and real.
5,Excellent,"Staggering in its use of sources, and authoritative on all counts. An incredible book and timeless resource."
5,get the lot all here,"Don't bother with all the solo rubbish ,simply get this collection,best of the Jam,best of Style Council and best of paul Weller solo"
3,Weller 101: For the Kiddies.,"Great for beginners: Snap, Singular Adventures and PW Greatest Hits + in 1 big slick Tootsie Roll....Why not the single version of Here's a New Thing, the best song from PWM?? Overall, Not very interesting for the real fans....For those that have no idea what I'm talking about this box is for you."
5,magnificent writing,the book was a powerhouse of entertainment. i was riveted to the pages as i really began to understand and identify with the characters. tybee island will never be the same for me. the author obviously remembers tybee island the way it used to be.
4,BBC Radio Recordings,This would be a much better series in a copleat box set of the radio series. It would be even better (5 Star rating) if the first two portioins of the radio brodcasts were availble on CD in the USA.I look foward to listing to the first two sets of CD's when they become availble.
1,"Lots of Hope, Little delivery","I've been a fan of Hitchhiker for a long time, so naturally bought the CDs for Tertiary Phase.I only heard the first two CDs of the set, and haven't developed the interest to finish. Why?First, note that the original person who did the voice of the guide died, and the replacement just doesn't compare - at all.The plot seems to be zany for zany sake, and not funny. The talking mattress doesn't help the plot but is more of a distraction.It's like the author just hobbled the book together in a hurry to make some easy money. I don't think his soul was in it. Too bad, because I would have loved for the series to go on."
1,Terrible.,"Quite possibly the worst book ever written. If you're looking for a well-written, complex, and in-depth look at this literary character, try Susan Kay's ""Phantom."""
4,Fun adventure,The Phantom of Manhattan is a fun continuation of The Phantom of the Opera story. It's an easy read that entertains. You get a more in-depth look at the motivations of the Phantom than you do in the movie/play.
3,decent enough,"the ending was nice,with each chapter it skips around a lot though,it keeps telling the same thing over with slight differences and adding a bit more everytime.by the end of the book i was a little curious....but nowhere near as phantom by susan kay."
3,a slight disappoinment,In the past reviews I have heard very nasty comments about this book but I read it anyway and believe me it is not trash and it is not a HUGE disappointment. Even though it did'nt live up to the original novel it was very intresting to see what became of our phantom. But the phantom did die at the end of the original novel which I found really confusing because in this book he is alive(duh). But it was well written and the ending was very surprising and bautifully told I think.
1,Horrible!,"This book disgusted me beyond belief. i could go on for hours, but I'll just say that Forsyth wrote piece of garbage! He trashed Leroux, and then wrote a highly unlikely and unbelievable continuannce to The Phantom of The Opera! As a big Phan, this is an insult. It's also not worth reading if you are not a Phan. The writing is hoorendous, confusing, and suitable for a 5th grade quick pick.And the pages aren't even soft enough to wipe my bum with"
2,Coming from Forsythe .. dissapointing !,"Coming from Forsythe ... this was one BIG dissapointment. I read the preface before buying it, and was expecting something reallyy worth reading out of it, instead what I got was a really bad sequel to a really great story. It was heartwarming to see his efforts at potraying the phantom as much more than just a beast, but the story lacked credibility, and felt like a badly sticked quilt !"
1,Time Waster,I decided to get this book to see if it was anything like Phantom of The Opera. The first couple pages of the book was good. Well once you go into it I was like so where is the plot. It was a waste of time for me to get this book.
2,Big mistake for usually talented author,"What was Forsyth thinking with this one? and for ALW to give it the thumbs up, it's a disgrace to phans everywhere! just read susan kaye's book, it is by far better ."
2,tearing down a good literary character,"What Forsyth has done here is changed a Salvador Dali into a still life. Everything that made the phantom such an intriguing character in the original book, everything that made us have sympathy for him, has been stripped away. What's left is a thoroughly dislikable phantom and a lot of dry dialogue. I don't doubt that Andrew Lloyd Weber will be able to dig up enough from this book to make a decent new musical. For those of us who haven't been knighted, though, this book is not worth the read."
3,This book isn't written for Phantom Fans,"Most of the reviews on this page are from disgruntal ""Phantom Fans."" However, This book wasn't written for the Die-hard Phantom of the Opera Fans. If you have read any of Forsyth's other books, you would realize that it contains many of the elements typical to his style. However, don't read this book thinking that it is going to be a polictical thriller, becuase it is not. So, give it a chance, It isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be."
5,Wow I loved the audio cassette! Great performance,"Too bad people didn't get the audio cassette. It was WONDERFUL! I guess the performance changes everything. The suspense was well done the story line worked well with the pace. I had a great time listening to it, sat in my car to hear more."
5,Couldn't put it down!!,I LOVED this book! I couldn't put it down! I kept wanting to see what was going to happen next! Andrew Lloyd Webber is smart for making a sequel based on this book! I can't wait! If you loved the original book The Phantom Of The Opera then you will LOVE this book!!!!!
1,This is a book?,"You have to be kidding me! I've seen third graders write better than this. FF must have knocked this thing out in about two hours, then went out and had a few beers. They should PAY you to read this thing."
1,Disgrace to the original work!,"I am appalled after reading this book. It completely throws out the original book, and bases the whole story of the Andrew Lloyd Webber Musical. Not only does he bash the original story, but then tries to disprove it! I find it sort of a paradox, trying to disprove a work that one is writing a sequel to! Apparently, trying to impress Lloyd Webber, ALW's name is even mentioned at least 10 times in the preface! Forsyth goes even farther and says at the end of the preface - ""This is the story of the Lloyd Webber musical and it is the only one to make sense."" I think you should compare his book to the original and see which one makes sense.I don't even recommend this book to a NON-Phantom fan, as it will probably even make the world hate ""The Phantom of the Opera."" Negative infinity stars would be the best rating."
3,The Phantom of Manhattan,"A very good book, though not the best I have read by Frederick Forsyth, but the editing in the Kindle version was poor. Many misspelled words, words run together, words hyphenated for no apparent reason, etc."
1,Phan Phail,"This book has irrational explanations for everything, from the creation of this book (it questions Leroux's validity, how can you do this anyway considering The Phantom of the Opera was a work of fiction anyways) to the characterizations of all of the characters.The one good thing about this book is the opera scene towards the end with explaining the context of a duet Erik and Christine sing in the Manhattan opera House. Otherwise, this book is rather illogical based on the concepts of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical to which it was based on.If you want a very good piece of fan fiction that has a magnificient plot, and not a soap opera, I would suggest you read PHANTOM by SUSAN KAY, which is probably one of the BEST adaptations of the Phantom of the Opera nPhantomovel."
1,Horrendous Piece,"I am an avid PotO fan, and when I heard Love Never Dies was coming, I immediately began researching all I could, and apparently this book was at least partially the inspiration for it. Earlier, I looked upon the sequel with anticipation, but now that I have read this piece of garbage, my hopes have been dashed. This book is HORRENDOUS. It has none of the wonder that exists within Leroux's novel, or any of the magic that is in the ALW musical. The entire book seemed completely forced, and had no real decency to it.If you are looking for more PotO, I suggest Phantom by Susan Kay, which is much more enjoyable (and ties in to the original story better). I gave this 1 star simply because I'm forced to give it something."
1,A Phantom Failure,"This book was terrible. It completely contradicts the orginal novel. Oh, and by the way, how can Gaston Leroux's novel be incorrect? It was his brainchild in the first place. Even if I knew nothing of Phantom of the Opera prior to reading this book, I wouldn't have enjoyed it. The plot was stupid. In the end, I kept reading just for the pure sake of being able to say I read it. I think people should step away from reincarnating Phantom. Give the story a rest. The Phantom dies at the end, okay? There is no more story. Thanks for reading my review. I hope you agree."
1,Phantom betrayal,"How do I review the work of a person who begins his novel by trashing the work of the man on whose famous work his novel is based? Gaston Leroux's classic novel ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has thrilled readers and movie/theater patrons who have seen the screen & stage adaptations of his work. Forsyth attempts to expand on Leroux's characters, while saying that Leroux was totally wrong in his creation of those same characters.The Phantom of Manhattan is written from many different points of view, which makes it very confusing. The characters do not ""live,"" they are not believable, more cardboard than living, breathing people. For those familiar with the Leroux Phantom or the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, these characters bear little resemblance to any of those beloved characters. This story is neither romance, nor mystery. I would advise anyone who wants to read about the Phantom to read the original Leroux book, or the wonderful novel, Phantom by Susan Kaye."
1,Not the true phantom,"Please do not waste your time and money on this book. If you want to read a book that captures every element of the phantom of the opera, read Phantom, by susan kay. It is better than the original novel. here, forsyth creates a pitiful soap opera where his characters are unemotional and one dimensional. The facts do not even come close to matching the original novel. He left out important characters and gave all the credit to Andrew Lloyd Weber for the original. I found the book a severe disappointment. some things are not meant to have a sequel. This book was written purely out of egotism and greed. There is no understanding of the story or what it means. Please, reread the original or susan kay's book before even thinking of buying this filth."
1,Disappointment,"I read this for a book report when I was in community college a few years ago. At first, I thought it was a good book. Then, I got to the end of the book and realized that, though it is a well written book, the plot stunk. It's not worth the time it takes to read this book. There are better fan-written sequels than this one. Heck, I could write a better one than this. So, don't waste your time reading this."
1,Completely disappointing,"I was so excited to read this book when I saw it on the shelf, and so disappointed when I finished it. Like the other reviewers, I found the multiple narrators completely irritating, as well as the lack of depth. The best audience for this kind of book would have been the true ""Phantom"" fans, and if they're like me, they would have wanted a long story, full of depth and character expansion, not something like a fluffy tabloid serial. Ironically, I thought the story of itself was just fine, but would have been much better if it had depth and one or two narrators. The only redeeming thing is that ... - I found it at...a book sale."
2,It was okay...,"But not worth spending money on. I'd recomend getting it at a local library so you can return it when you're done. I'm still looking for the perfect Phantom sequel, and I'm starting to think there isn't one! But that's okay. I love the story alone. Anyways, this is a sequel to Phantom, and I don't really like it. Forsyth could have spent a lot more time on the characters and everything. I also didn't care for the ending, but I won't tell what happens..."
3,"Not Leroux, but not as bad as some say; well read.","This ""sequel"" to Gaston Leroux's Phantom Of The Opera finds Erik following his lady love Christine to New York. While not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be, it's not Leroux. However, it's well read by the actors, including, Roger Rees as The Phantom and Arte Johnson. The others weren't bad. It would be nice to know who played some of the other characters. The voice introducing the chapters was low, and mysterious, in keeping with the story, although, at first, I thought there was something wrong with my tape player; until I heard the other voices and knew then it was ok. Worth a listen but Forsyth should stick more to thrillers like Day Of The Jackal, The Dogs Of War, and The Odessa File."
2,"As a Phantom fan I had to read this book, it was alright.","Since I am a Phantom fan this book caught my attention, so I bought it. It was alright and i would recommend it to any die hard Phantom fan for insight to a possibility of what happened after The Phantom of the Opera's mysterious disappearance; however, if you are not a die hard fan I recommend that you not read this book for fear causing you to lose interest in The Phantom of the Opera."
2,Needs a good musical number,"The emotion of either the play or the novel is traded for checkout rag gossip. It reeks of a story penned by a teenage fan for a quick writing assignment. Unless you are obsessed with all things Phantom, you will likely forget where you left off several times during the book."
1,"Not even close, Mr. Forsyth!","Like the faithful Phantom phan I am, I was drawn to this book because of the title. I couldn't wait to read it, and when I finished it, I was sorely disappointed.I was thoroughly amazed at the lack of storyline given to Christine. I wasn't thrilled with the ever-changing narrator, most of whom were frightfully boring. I'm reading the book to find out what happens to Christine, Raoul, et al. and I could care less what paper this person works for, what sort of pants the ""fun master"" wears, etc. And the rediculous ""trances"" and ""prayers"" have got to go! There wasn't enough of the original characters, Erik aside. Erik's continuing plot was a bit silly; going from gutting fish to being the most wealthy man in NYC.If you want to read this book because you loved the original, I would only for the sake of completion, not because it's as riveting and engaging as the first.Tepid, at best."
1,"Does not deserve even one star, but Amazon made me do it!","I recall when in my most rabid Phantom phase that I would read read anything related to Phantom that I can. I should have just skipped this one. My anger at Forsyth began even before I read the actual book. He begins by giving us a very longwinded explanation about how Leroux was a kook who can't be trusted and totally discredits the orignal book written by him. Then he changes most of the original story to suit his whims and tells a short and horrible tale. If I were Leroux (and still alive of course) I'd sue for damages.If you are really morbidly curious enough to read this book, I suggest taking it out of the local library, or at least buying it used, also preferably at a library so that you do not waste much more on it that your time, and won't feel bad ditching it somewhere afetrwards."
2,Worst sequel since Beverly Hills Cop 3!,"The original Phantom of the Opera was a book about a sinister monster that terrorized an Opera and the love of his life. It was thrilling and theatrical at the same time, and a classic. This book is neither.Basically, the Phantom escapes death and becomes a millionaire in Manhattan. He anonymously builds an Opera House and persuades his former love to come back to perform. Then he tries to seduce the girl once again.The book is mostly a description of Erik's and his former lover's life. The thrills and the mystery are all gone. This book is barely a shell of its predecessor, and I don't recommend it all."
1,one star is too generous for this book,"trash. aside from murdering the story of the phantom altogether, this book is an insult to every thinking person out there. the book was so bad I actually laughed out loud during the supposed 'tearjerking' moments. spare yourself and don't bother reading this one."
1,"not very good, silly sequal","This sequal, as i understand it to be is just plain bad. i think all the other comments said here are true, so if you still want to read this book, you are crazy! but if you like bad characterisation, bad plots (was there a plot? ) bad story telling and bad writing, go for it. if you have any taste, skip this and save yourself the money. This book isn't even worth it for interests sake."
3,An Okay Phantom Sequel,"If you are looking for something different than usual Phantom books, then this is one of them. I would recommend this book; it can pull you in, but there are some flaws. If you are a straight phantom fan and do not like alterations, you might not like it. It is a very nicely written story."
1,A Terrible Disappointment,"This book may be liked by Phantom of the Opera fans, but if you are expecting a typical Forsyth novel, you will be extremely disappointed by this book. The character development one normally finds in his books is non-existent. The intrigue, plot twists and surprises expected in his usual work is woefully missing. This seems to be a book written for one of two reasons:1) he had nothing to do on a rainy weekend, or 2) he belted something out to meet the publisher's deadline.I suppose he is laughing all the way to the bank as many of his devotees purchase the book because they expect his usual level of excellence. In the future, I will certainly be more selective in my choice of books by Frederick Forsyth."
1,This book completely buries Leroux's vision of the Phantom !,"I can not belive I spent $20 on a book that makes fun of the original novel.As a Phantom Phan,I found the original novel just magnificent.In the novel,the Phantom dies from love.In this so called sequel,his lives and makes millons in New York only to find out that he's the father of Christine's son and not Raoul's! This novel just demolishes the idea that Leroux wanted.The idea was that there was an opera ghost,but he was distroyed by lust,betrayl,obsession,and what killed him was...his love for Christine. So it's up to you to find out what the fate of the Phantom shoud be. Dead in the labyrinths of the opera house,or,in New York with a son. It's your choice."
1,GOD-AWFUL,"I will say I did cry at the end of this book- crying that i had wasted mt time reading this sickening garbage. They killed the Phantom! Frederick whats-his-face takes Erik's background from every version, Leroux's, Lloyd Webber's and Kay's. He wants it to follow the musical but Erik has a son-so how does that happen? Just wants fans of Kay's book to eat it up and go along? Erik working on Coney Island in a clown mask making his fortune by designing theme parks? Scary eh? Look, If you want to be able to feel the same about Erik, don't go near this pathetic excuse for literature. You'll thank me."
3,Commissioned By Andrew Lloyd Webber,People who have complained about this being more tribute to the Webber play than to the original LeRoux novel need to check their facts. Webber wanted to create a sequel to his acclaimed operatic blockbuster. But he was having trouble writing a story to accompany five new songs he wrote for it. Enter Frederick Forsyth to help him lay it all out for an eventual sequel on the stage...let us hope.
4,Powerful and Poignant,"I SOOO glad I never read reviews, or seldom anyway. Having just finished the book, and with tears streaming down my face, I can only marvel at those who gave it bad reviews. Forsyth's approach is unusual but it works. Recounting events from the point of view of many different people has the effect of the omnicient narrator, but reads more like a documentary. The feeling comes from the reader's own heart and soul, not from the pen of the writer. I have no idea of the historical accuracy and couldn't care less. It is a sequal to a legend, woven around actual historical events, but with ""phantom"" qualities. The technique works for me and I'll treasure the story of ""flying in a sky of pain over a sea of despair"" for a long time."
4,Phantom of Manhattan,"A real switch for Frederick Forsyth. A logical, entertaining sequel to ""Phantom of the Opera""."
4,You'll either Love it or Hate it...,"And I loved it! After reading many of the other reviews, I was not surprised that others did not enjoy it as much as other Phantom novels, simply because it is it written very much in the same style as the original Leroux novel - a dark mystery novel with a tragic love tale interwoven - not the other way around, as most Phans are hoping for.The author's approach by writing each chapter as a different character who plays a role in the story is a bit distracting at first, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,This book was lacking.,"I'll be honest with the reader of this review. I could not finish this book. The author had definitely missed the spirit of the original story, the personalities of the characters, especially of Erik himself. Further, although the author obviously had done some research into the history of the period, he had apparently not read much of the literature of the period because he missed the ""voice"" of the period. By that I mean, the way that people spoke and what they spoke of. His characters spoke as if they lived at today, not the late Victorian period. In short, he did not understand the culture of the time. Do your self a favor. Don't read this book. (You might try Angel of the Opera instead, especially if you happen to also like Sherlock Holmes)."
1,Trash. Do not read,"This review will be brief as most other reviewers expressed the same opinion. I also do not think this book was written by Forsyth. The characters are quarter-finished with no inner or outer life. The multiple narration permits much filler with no relation to story line. In fact this book is probably an outline for a Webber musical, which is the only thing that makes sense of this non-novel, especially with the authors awknowledgement that the idea for the book came from Webber. The book is typical Webber without the music and scenes. I believe that Webber's musicals are all special effects and little substance. That describes this book. In effect , the book is a ripoff. Buyers should beware spending money on a premature musical script. A Forsyth secretary wrote the outline and he sold it as a book usung his well-deserved name as bait."
1,Baffling,"I find it difficult to believe that Forsyth actually wrote this book. It lacks all of the qualities of a Forsyth novel - complex characters and plot. More perplexing, it doesn't read like one of his books (eg, I would place it at reading level grade 8). Completely disappointing."
1,Don't Bother.,"As a new ""phan-attic"", I was eager to read The Phantom of Manhattan.... boy, do I wish I hadn't.As the story is told through several character's eyes (most of which I think were added to fill pages), the redundancy is appalling. I felt like I was getting the same story in each chapter with miniscule bits of new information. I finally thumbed to the end of the book simply to find out what happened to Christine and her son, Pierre.The only benefit I found in this book was the preface, however, much of it was from the author's immagination, rather than from fact.********************A book I LOVE is The Phantom Returns by Stefanie Cole. It brings to mind the characters from the Phantom of the Opera movie (2004) perfectly, but does have some typos (not enough to irritate me, but it might to some)."
1,Save yourself the heartache!,"I am a die hard Phantom Phan. I have been for about 15 years now. I view every form of Phantom movies/plays/performances and literature I can get my hands on.My 1st experience with reading this was an ARC (advanced reading copy) a friend that worked at a bookstore scored for me. I was SO excited for a new POTO book endorced by Webber to come out!Blech! If you care AT ALL for the main characters, this is NOT the book for you.I actually enjoy the different variations on a theme, this is not variation of a theme, it's butchery of a theme.The ""author"" starts the book stating how horrible he thinks the original Leroux version is. If you dislike a book so passionately, WHY write about the characters??I just found out in the news today that ALW is going to work with Forsyth for his upcoming sequel to be out in 2009 / 2010. I'm heart broken. ALL excitement about seeing a sequel on stage has deflated out of me."
1,Phantom fans stay away! Terrible story.,"I give this tale a -100. Characters had no depth, aroused no feeling of any kind. Author completely ignored facts and happenings in the original novel and musical. Author obviously had no feelings for what he was writing. This tale is an insult to the wonderful characters in the novel and the musical. Orginal facts were changed to support author's ideas. If you want to read some truly great Phantom stories check out the webb and see what the fans have written. Those stories put this one to shame."
1,Phantom Fans Beware!!!,"This is *not* Leroux's (or even Lloyd-Webber's) Phantom. This is an entirely different character that the author apparently couldn't work up the creativity (or courage) to establish independently. Rather than attempt to stand on his own merits, the author instead chooses to extend a pre-existing story (which has a definitive end, by the way) while belittling and contradicting it at the same time. The characters are mere shadows; they may as well be completely different people who just happen to share the names of the primary figures from ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I find it laughable and yet infuriating that such an apparently well-known author would even think of putting forth such a sophomoric effort. If you're looking for a Phantom of the Opera pastiche, try visiting the many fan-operated websites that offer much better fare for free."
4,The Story Continues.....,"I picked this book up from a clearance rack, not really knowing what it was or what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a continuation of the Phantom of the Opera (which I had not read, but am currently in the process of doing so). The characters are very real and believable, although the story itself is somewhat far-fetched. The tale is told from the perspectives of several different people, and is told masterfully, without losing any continuity. If you've not read Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, you should do so before reading this book, as the story is almost completely based on previous happenings. If you have read it, then go ahead and pick this one up....it will leave you wishing for more."
3,Phantom of Manhattan,"I am a Phantom-maniac so anything written about the Phantom intrigues me. This was a big departure from Forsythe's other books, but I found it fascinating, particularly the preface that detailed the building of the Paris Opera House. It was, of course, very far-fetched, but still held my attention - short book - read in 2 days."
2,Go see Love Never Dies instead!,Okay so this book probably sucks. I have read a ton of these negative reviews to know that I should no waste my money. But I just want to say that the sequel musical Love Never Dies is AMAZING! So do not read this book. Go see the play. Yes it is sort of based on this because ALW told this Freddy dude to write it. The play is so much better. In Love Never Dies The Phantom is brilliant once again. Christine is smart and talented and beatiful and sweet. Their son Gustave is adorable and intelligent and the perfect combination of Erik and Christne. Raoul is still kind of a jerk and Meg Giry & her vicious mother make you scream. But that is part of the story. The music is great and Love Never Dies is just amazing. Go see that instead!
2,"Phans will want to read, but really poorly done","Phans everywhere will want to read this just to see what is imagined for the main characters' future, but the writing is awful. Even the novella format is too long, so expect to skim most of it to get to the climax."
1,A Stinker!,"Yep. This one is a real stinker. I loaned my copy to a friend, and don't care if it ever gets returned to me. As many others have said, don't waste your time on this book."
1,Not worth it!,"This book is odd because the Frederick Forsyth starts off explaining how Gaston Leroux made a lot of mistakes in his original novel and then Forsyth seams to repeat the original mistakes.He writes the story though random reports of characters you've never heard of. These new characters overhear conversations between Christine and Erik (the Phantom) and retell their friends. Each chapter is told by someone else. Reading it makes you feel so far away from the story. You end up sorting though nonsense trying to find the story of Christine and Erik.I see how they say, ""captures the spirit and style of Gaston Leroux's novel..."" they just forgot to tell you that it's also mixed up and in need of a rewrite.If you haven't read Susan Kay's Phantom, go for that one. If you have read Susan Kay's Phantom, read it again. There is no other Phantom novel like it. -----Phantom of Manhattan is not worth it."
2,Nothing beats the original Phantom,"I am a huge Phantom of the Opera fan, both the Leroux novel and the Webber play. This book was written by a close friend of Webber so I thought this would be one of the better ""spin off"" continuation type novels. I actually found it to be pretty lacking. I didnt find any of the intriguing mystery I expected in this Phantom, just a guy full of himself and bent on revenge it seemed but nothing too special. The ending was kind of a surprise but I agree, not really all that believable. Plus, the whole tangent on the money god and all that detracted from the main story (at least for me) and just ended up boring me until it got back to Christine and the original tale. If you want a REALLY awesome spinoff of the Phantom novel, read PHANTOM by Susan Kay. I found the history she creates for Eric brilliant."
3,You get what you pay for,"While you do indeed get what you pay for with this set in a tin,I would suggest that you buy the IHF {International Historic Film} version as you receivea number of extras among which is a handy scene selection, this comes very handy if youwould rather bypass toadies such as a speech by the Deputy Leader in the NSDAP Covention Hall.""You are Germany.When you act the nation acts.When you judge the people judge""later on .........""You were the guarantor of victory for usYou will be our guarantor of peace"".The only extra with the red tin version is a yes/no to English subtitles."
4,Teaching Film History,"This is a scary yet informative documentary that demonstrates the power of the Nazi propaganda. If you are teaching film history during the Nazi era, or the 30's, this is an excellent film to use."
3,A very cute tool,"This book is excellent for teaching small children about the limitations and possibilties of a younger sibling. It is also one of the only books about two brothers available for very young children. When my son was disappointed to learn that he would not be receiving the younger sister he had yearned for, this book was great in getting him excited about a little brother. No masterwork of fiction, this, but it does get its point across loud and clear, and that is what matters with this sort of children's book anyhow. Some of the activities anticipated by Little Critter may not be those that every parent wants to encourage, but again, that probably isn't the point."
3,Just Me And My Little Brother,"Me And My Little Brother is a great children's book for ages 5-7.The book is about a young critter and his little brother doing all different things together. The two of them have snowball fights, ride bikes, and have many more fun adventures together.There is not much of a lesson to learn, but to be nice to young kids and to help build a strong relation ship with your siblings.On a scale from one to ten I give it a seven."
2,very unhappy with the guns in this book,"Sorry to be PC, but I don't expect a children's book aimed at 3 year olds to show kids playing with toy guns. My son was (unfortunately) fascinated by the guns since he'd never seen them. TWO of the scenes in this book show playing with toy guns. I wish I'd thrown this book out when it was given to us as a gift."
5,Great gift for a big brother AND little brother!,"I have two children, 11 years apart, and my eldest (11) had been wanting a baby brother or sister since he could speak. When I got pregnant, he was ecstatic and couldn't wait for this baby to be a part of our lives. Once we found out it was going to be a boy, he was even more elated! So, for Christmas, I bought this book for the both of them to share - for big brother to read to his little brother and for little brother to appreciate time spent with his big brother!"
3,I don't know why I bought this.,"I don't like this movie. I bought it for someone. I don't know why I bought it for someone. This is not a movie I'd normally watch. I don't know anything about surfing. The three girls on the box are kind of strange looking. Why is the girl on the right laughing? I don't find surfing funny.As for the movie itself, this is the ultimate ""this is our third date and I agreed to watch this at your house, will you at least let me touch your bare stomach or back if we aren't going to make out"" movie. You pretend to watch this movie while your date is genuinely interested in its plot. I also refer to this movie as the ""I tried looking for a copy of Blue Velvet at Suncoast and found 30 used copies of this instead"" film. If you like water and smiling, you'll probably like this film. I really hope my fiance, an avid surfer, is not reading this right now. Oh crap she's leaving me"
2,bad quality,"One of the lenses does not snap. (I am not the most dexterous guy, but not the klutz either).After careful inspection I discovered that left and right lenses are slightly different in size and that the right side of the frame is a little more flexible than the left one.It seems that outsourcing from France to China did not help company's bottom line in my case. I returned the product.2 stars, because the lenses when they stay in place are actually helping to see the ball better."
4,Good product...just be aware,"Have used my Bolle sunglasses for a week now, and I really like the fact it comes with three different lenses. The lenses take some practice changing in and out, and I've had a few problems with them popping out. Once the lenses are in, the sunglasses are very light to wear and cover a large portion of the face. Overall, I am happy with my purchase, with the only comment they need to improve the lense changing."
5,Bolle sunglasses,I don't know what I would do without these glasses. I use them for golf changing lens to match the light conditions. What I don't understand is why these glasses are not promoted more or that they don't seem to have any competition. I get asked about mine all the time.
5,Love these Bolle's,I couldn't find these anywhere but at a good price here! Love em' and wouldn't wear any other sunglasses especially as they are equipt with a script!
3,Good but not great,"TNT Buns and Thighs is a 30 minute workout, including a 5 minute warm-up and 5-minute cooldown. This workout is perfect for beginners but for me, a more advanced excerciser and modern dancer, this was not the best workout. It was not difficult or interesting enough. Still, I liked the instructor, Leisa Hart."
5,Tosca on a grand scale at Verona,"There are many wonderful recordings of Tosca and you may already own a good selection, but this is worth adding to your collection. Giacomo Aragall is in his prime. Although he had a voice of consummate beauty,a handsome dramatic presence on stage,and sang at all major opera houses, his discography is not as large as he deserved. Eva Marton and Ingvar Wixell are both excellent as is the conducting by Daniel Oren. The production is large scale befitting the Verona Arena. A very satisfying performance."
3,"Pioneer he was, but of limited talent","Kurtis Blow started out strong, as evidenced by some of this CD. ""Christmas Rap"" jammed in Black communites in Xmas of 79 (and many Xmases thereafter). Unfortuantely, his vocal talents were limited and he often sounded like Bullwinkle trying to rap. Songs like ""Tough,"" ""Starlife,"" and ""A.J. Scratch"" are extremely hard to listen to with a straight face. You're almost waiting to hear Rocky the flying squirrel to say, ""But that trick NEVER works!"" This time for sure, presto!"
2,semi good,It only has one good song and that's THIS ARE THE BREAKS. Maybe that's why he didn't make too far.
2,Not at all like the picture,"I just got this charger for my gigabeat, and it works fine except the ""tip exchange"" means that you have about 2 inches of connector sticking out the side of the unit. I specifically bought this charger based on the picture so it would fit in my glove box, but it won't with the huge plug out side. Maybe there's some fine print that says it's not an actual picture of the unit, but now I have to send it back. I was expecting a little more for $20."
2,Inaccurate translation,"This edition has two advantages: it is very cheap and very tame. However, this same translation is the problem, although it manages to avoid some of the anachronistic elements of some more liberal translations. The explicit material is what defines this play and gives it its classical ""Greekness"" but none of that is present in this edition. It is certainly written for a younger audience not in touch with Greek theater.It's cheap, but this text does not reflect what the Greek one does. Skip it."
2,Shocked!,"Except for the name Caran d'Ache, this hardly qualifies as a fine writing instrument and is more in the category of pens of BIC quality. In fact, it is simply a cheaply made plastic pen that happens to have been produced in Switzerland. To complete the outrage, it arrived in a tawdry vinyl coin purse-like case that was an insult. For $70.00 plus shipping, one expects to be rather pleased with the purchase when it is a Caran d'Ache. But this, this is beyond comprehension. I have used pens chained to the counters at banks that were more impressive. At least those pens are more substantial and more smoothly finished. Caran d'Ache should be ashamed of this crummy piece of trash! No self respecting collector of fine writing instruments would display this. The humiliation would be just too much to bear."
3,Pretty good,"Whoever designed this string knew what they were doing! Can't stress enough though, If you're a US size 32, then you need to get this in a 34 or bigger. I give it three stars because I didn't get the larger size, but even the small didn't feel uncomfortable. I'll be getting a few more in the future. Again though, buy a size larger than your usual US size."
2,Creates A Very Weird Scent,"I recently purchased secret clincal strength, and I am not pleased with the results. I applied some of this deodorant at night and followed the directions. Instead of leaving me powder fresh, It left a very unpleasant odor... worse than sweat. My daughter also used it and people in class commented her scent. It was a very embarrsing situtation for her. One positive to secret clinical strength is that it leaves smooth armpits. I recommend that you dont use this product. Go to a doctor and get perscription strength."
1,Better off with no deoderant.,"I purchased this product and used it like the directions said and I sweated more and smelt bad and I usually don't have a problem with smelling bad. I also tried it at morning and evening, no results. I highly reccomend against this product unless you just want your armpits to smell good for 10-20 minutes."
2,Disappointing dispenser,The deodorant itself has a nice fragrance and rolls on smoothly. However the dispenser requires very dry hands and strong fingers to press the deodorant through the slots at the top by rotating a disc at the bottom. I usually must thoroughly dry my hands and/or wipe off any lotion on them to get enough traction to dispense it. I bought a 3 pack at Costco and would be happy to return it for something easer to dispense.
2,I must be a special case....,"I started using this product last Thursday, it is now Monday. The only time I have an issue is when I am at work. I get really nervous and stressed around this ONE individual at work. It didn't work on Friday, but I thought I would give it all weekend to work. Well it's Monday, didn't sweat a drop all weekend, but I was at work 15 mins and I'm sweating like a pig now. I guess I must just be special. I really need to learn how to deal with my stress and just get over it. It's really annoying."
1,Deceptive packaging and product does not work,"I sweat moderately-to-heavily and tried Secret Clinical Strength as soon as it came on the market. First of all, I neglected to check the product weight...the box is enormous, but the actual container itself is VERY small...and only filled about halfway, at that. So, per ounce, it is extremely expensive. Secondly, while the deodorant aspect is fine (smells fresh throughout the day), the antiperspirant aspect is TERRIBLE. I'll have pools of sweat under my arms within two hours...something that doesn't happen with regular deodorant/antiperspirants, even in the summer. Perhaps it's my personal body chemistry, but this product does not work for me."
1,TOO Expensive - save your money and buy Suave,"Sorry, this stuff works great, but it is WAY OVERPRICED and a rip off. Save your hard earned money and buy Suave - the 24 Hour Protection - make sure you get the 24 HOUR PROTECTION Suave, it has the same ingredients and same strength only for much cheaper - on sale you can get it for $1.79 or $2.49 regular price!!!"
1,"Secret Clinical...unsatisfied, waste of money!!!","I never liked the secret product line. I thought hey, I'll give this one a try. In a desperate attempt to find a new product to cure the extreme sweaty armpits.This product is horrible! I wish I could have given negative stars!! I swear it made me sweat more than ever before. (keep in mind this is only a normal day at work at the office) imagine the gym...It's an absolute waste of money. Honestly I never write reviews, I was just so compelled to do so to warn anyone who thinks of purchasing this product!!"
5,best anti-perspirant yet!,"After reading many reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy this product. However, I am sooooo glad I did! This anti-perspirant works just as it states. I put it on at night and then refresh it in the morning. It has been in the 100's where I live and not once has the perspiration broken through my underarms. Thank God for this product!"
3,I expected more,"I bought Secret Clinical Strength about a week ago and have been using it ever since. I have to apply it evenings AND mornings for it to work. Re odor and wetness control, it's only slightly better than conventional antiperpirants."
1,Won't come out of the dispenser,"As a deodorant, I think it works slightly better than my usual Right Guard. It's not astoundingly great. However what prompted me to write a review is the ridiculous dispenser. It requires the strength of ten thousand men to operate. I can't get it to turn at all. I have to ask my boyfriend to do it and even he can only turn it with a weird special grip technique. The fact that no other reviews seem to mention this makes me wonder if I just got one with a manufacturing flaw. But really...it's absurd. I would never buy this deodorant again, at least not in this dispenser style."
2,poor quality,Having seen this on tv I was eager to purchase. DVD has flaws in second movie and I should have returned. I love the first part and it is ok so I kept.
2,Not what I was expecting,The brief summary of the book was explaining exactly what I was looking for but after receiving the book I wasn't so excited. The book was written in the early 1900's and most of the information was out dated and not useful.
2,Not worth to buy it,This book is a mere compilation of hebrew entries with an obvious affinity to the Golden Dawn version of the Cabala. After finding errors in the Hebrew side the reader looses trust in using it as resource for further investigation. The book doesn't make any refence to important cabalistic originals but includes a huge section of questionable gematria.For those ones who are especially interested in poor researched Western Cabala this book might be of any use.
5,A must resource for the library!!,"This book provides the practitioner a great resource for the Cabala. The book has listings of Angels, names of God, spirits, and more!! The book was written by a very knowledgable author with deep roots. The book wasn't meant for someone looking for rituals but as a Encyclopedia for everything Cabala (or however you want to write it). The new help for the Hebrew alphabet and pronunciation is helpful but the student should still seek more intense studies of the language before getting too deep. Otherwise I use this book constantly for research and resource."
5,"This Book is incredible,don't be told any different","This book has almost everything,I feel that this book is a wonderfull book full of little odds and ends that every student needs.It even pronounces most of the names for you(as accurate as anyone can get in a book)I mean this book for one, is thick and is meant for the use of serious students,It's not full of rituals,it's full of the things you need to do complex magick with(symbols,etc.)It's a must own..."
5,HERBIE GOES TO MONTE CARLO,"Loved the ""Herbie"" movies when I was a teen and they first came out. Now my grand-children are hooked on them. Great family entertainment, don't have to worry about inappropriate language or innuendoes, only violence is 1 punch in the jaw. What I like most about these movies? ""You don't have to try to figure out who the bad guys are"". Not a mind boggling or confusing movie. Background is not as realistic as today's movies, but still a very funny, light-hearted, enjoyable movie."
1,Take my advice...PLEASE! (See for all Herbie Sequel DVDs),"Disney is NOT adding any features whatsoever for the Herbie, the Love Bug sequels. The only thing that could possibly be of any good quality within these discs would be a remastering of the picture and sound. Unless you've given up using your VCR or you are a collector, don't waste your time purchasing the Herbie sequels. Only the original movie, The Love Bug is worthy of it's ""Special Edition"" title."
3,not the best in the series,"This movie was not what you would really call all that great in several respects. The believability, for one, hoovers around zero - the tunnel scene comes to mind. The characters really are not that great, either. The villainous inspector with his henchmen and the bumbling detective were funny in themselves but they were annoying, too. However, this movie in the Herbie series, was probably next-best to ""The Love Bug"" since Dean Jones is back and Don Knotts provides some classic scenes as well. Darcy is ok as well, but I found her character to be distracting and not all that necessary to the plot. If you want some laughs, this movie will provide them but don't expect anything very serious or believable."
4,Still Funny,"I remembered this movie from my childhood. My children enjoyed it as well, their ages range from 1-8. It's still funny."
2,Depressing,"A harsh look at the Eastern Front. The book follows the experiences of a Swedish SS soldier. What I found depressing about this story was his infatuation with Nazism. It bothers me how reasonably intelligent people can be duped by absurdity. At the end of the story he cuts and runs for his life, removing his beloved SS insignia. It appears that even though he gladly participated in the enslavement of a people, he wasnt about to reap the ""whirlwind."" A story of moral degeneracy and cowardice."
4,The hoplessness of the lost,"I would have thought that a book written by an ex-SS member would have been full of justification for what the Nazi's did in Europe. However this is more about combat experience and the hopelessness of the final fight in the last days of the Reich. Like soldiers everywhere it was about your mates rather than any political system One wonders if the full cost of the war was ever properly reconciled.A good read if you are interested in the Second World war, but I would avoid it if you are a bit squeamish. As a combat veteran I can understand many of the excesses and I have seen some pretty horrific sights especially when the perpetrators have been communists.Perhaps it should be standard reading at Dultroon."
2,Really slanted view point of the SS,"The author rambled about his political view of the SS thru out the book. There were some detailed combat stories that were poorly written. I did not agree with the SS ""Army of GOD"" defense or his view of the Russian Army being sub human. However it was an interesting read from someone totally immersed in the SS creed. I would recommend this book only to someone interested in the SS view point of the final battles around Berlin."
3,A good read.,"This story is about the narrative of a Waffen SS soldier named Eric Wallen. Of interest, Wallen was not German but Swedish and a part of a Scandanavian unit of volunteers. Wallen first joined the Fins and later the Germans and wound up fighting the Soviets all the way into Berlin. Wallen is a likeable fellow. His narrative is not maudlin or vindictive but upbeat and despite the odds he does not come across as unrealistic in his fighting to the end but as one committed (and idealistic) to a cause to the point of willing to sacrifice his life. He believed the Soviets were the greatest threat to Europe and the Germans efforts important to saving Europe from yet another invasion from the East. All in all, his narrative has an almost adventurous tone and it was reported that after the war he went on to fight in other theaters throughout the world. It was a good read, though limited, and left one wanting to know more about this character. I would give it a 3.5."
2,Forget it!,"Save your money, the book is a waste of time. The Swedish author who fights for Nazi Germany is never developed as a person and his combat experiences are poorly written. The author never understands the SS are war criminals, and the most interesting part of the book is the pictures.... forget it!"
1,Contents don't match title,"Not one word in this book has anything to do with Washington City or County, PA. The entire contents are the 1600's concerning religions in England, Maryland & Virginia colonies during that Timeframe. Then was no Washington county during this Timeframe & no mention of it in the entire book.The contents of this book have absolutely nothing to do with Washington, PAThe book contents are for some book entitled, ""Daystar of American freedom or birth & early growth of Toleration in the province of Maryland""Don't waste your money unless you want the wrong book. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until months later.Shame on Amazon!"
5,Berman the magnificent . . .,"Lazar Berman was one of the greatest pianist of this - or any - generation. His flawless technique and firm control of his instrument provided him easy access to the whole of the Classical, Romantic, Impressionistic and Neo-Classical repertoire. But like Michelangeli, Berman, instead, seemed to feel more at home in a select number of compositions.In the performances gathered together in this box, we see just how successful Berman was in these particular pieces. He plays them all, regardless of the composer, with the same fire and poetry that define his craft. He is, throughout, in top form.This box is a living, breathing testament to his art that on no account should be overlooked by any pianophile. For those of us who relish the transcendental in art, this is like discovering the Lost Ark on a daily basis. Enjoy."
3,Wish it was more bendy and less pokey,"Overall this parasol does its job, but the metal arm is not easily bent into positions that shield baby and still provide a view of baby for mom and dad. My son likes to hold the arm now and uses it to pull himself up (thank goodness for safety belts). Also, the tips of the parasol are pointy like a regular umbrella and will hurt baby if they get poked."
3,so-so,Insurrection and Crusade are both readable but I kept neither for my own library. However the other two in the time line stand together without Insurrection and Crusade and are a great read (In Death Ground and the Shiva Solution). Great visceral satisfaction for me anyway.
1,"Disappointing, I am afraid","I will never understand why some American authors have this need of constantly harping on the... the mythology of the story of their own country, I guess. I was quite enjoying the political setup of the story, when the Declaration of Independence started. I then realized that I was reading a sci-fi reworking of American history. Something similar to Orson Scott Card Book of Mormon-Earth saga. I would have enjoyed it anyway, but -in case someone had missed it- the authors launched in a word by word reiteration, going from tasteful recreation to lamentable rip-off. I am not American. I am not a mormon. I think such reworkings show a deep lack of respect for true history, specially because they tend to turn into maniquean expositions of Good vs. Bad. I would ask Mr. Weber and Mr. White to please refrain from further indulging on this historical... parodization. Here's one for subtlety, if originality is not possible."
3,Good first effort,"Insurrection was the author's first effort, and it shows. There are a few flaws here and there. The plotline revolves around a VERY bloody war of secession between the Fringe Worlds and the Corporate Worlds of the Terran Federation. The characters tend to be fairly flat, and the author's solution to a lot of issues is to go charging off to another bloody space battle.Fortunately, they learned, and their subsequent works (both solo in their own worlds and in tandem for this universe) have continually improved.One reviewer noted that this was a retelling of the American Revolution in a science fiction context. True. The authors are both Americans, and they do have both a lot of love for their country and a great deal of respect for those who serve their flag (whatever flag that may be). My suggestion for those who may be offended by such sentiments is to go read something else."
3,OK Space Opera in the Starfire Universe,"""Insurrection"" is OK space opera set in Starfire universe.The story is a melange of the American Civil War and WWII-type, Pacific-style, naval actions. In this case, the frontier worlds break away from the center of Terran power. In the process they rend the fabric of the Federation Space Navy.The characters are not real 3-D, but in space opera who cares? There are a tad more of them then I believe the authors are technically able to handle. I suspect the authors harbor a secret desire to write the sf version of ""The Winds of War"".Good stuff for those looking for a content-free shoot-em-up."
3,"It was fun reading, but hard to place it in the series.","I enjoyed reading the book, but I did had a hard time placing it into the series. As a stand a lone novel it was interesting and fun. Insurrection is suppose to be part of a series, but it doesn't connect with previous book in the series."
3,Looks good,"This item looks good, but broke within a year of having it with regular use. If you want something that will last longer, I would recommend looking for something else."
5,LOVE IT,"Finally a book that has what most of us really want, some funky funny hats. If you are looking for a nice ordinary hat, then stop right there and DON'T get this book. Howevery if you are wanting something EXCITING, different and very creative then grab this book. My 9 year old is a hat wearer and THANK YOU, I was running out of ideas."
2,"Beautiful knitting, but ugly hats.","I was cringing for the models wearing those monstrosities. But- if you can look at the one on the cover with the bird and consider wearing that, you certainly won't be put off by any of the rest of the designs.At least they are original."
5,Great portrait of old English boarding schools,I loved this book. I'm a real Anglophile and the characters are wonderfully fleshed out. A good book for kids to read too.
5,surprisingly engaging,"I opened this dusty tome in a sense of duty and with expectations of a dreary read. I am still engaged in reading, but am so pleased with it's contents so far that I am prompted to write these comments.The description of the horse driven coach journey to Rugby is delightfull, and worthy of Charles Dickens himself.The introduction of Tom to his guide (mentor)has ensured my continued attention.How can one review a book before finishing it?"
2,Tom Brown Oxford,Very dissapointed because the add offered two books in one - Tom Browns's Schooldays and Tom Brown at Oxford - and I only got the first one. Why was that so? How can I get the second one?
4,Good Set,Nice cheap cookware set. Don't expect the quality that you would get from the more expensive sets but this one is perfect for a beginning couple.
3,Exterior paint peels off after a couple of uses,"This looked like a great deal at $39.99 with free shipping, so I even gave it as a gift to a friend. To my disappointment, the exterior paint or coating started peeling on the saucepans after a couple of uses. Checked with my friend, and guess what - the same thing ! Perhaps, one could live with an ugly exterior because the interior non-stick surface is still alright, but I wouldn't gift this set to anybody else."
3,good for a few years only,"for the price, this product is ok. i paid amazon $39.99(which included S&H). although i am very careful about my non-stick cookwares (never clean them in dishwasher, use mild soap and scrubber), the outer coating has already started chipping (after 7 months of use). do not expect this set to be heavy enough to stay upright always on your burner. if you intend to keep it like an use & throw product, you may wanna buy it for the use for a few years. if you believe in lifetime product, forget about it, close your eyes, open your wallet and go for calphalon, expensive but excellent stuff (some of them have lifetime warranty)."
4,Good collection for a two member family,"This is a good set for a two member family. If you are expecting it to be big enough to cook for 4 people, it may not serve the purpose. It's ideal for cooking food for 2 people. Quality of the product is good and I'm satisfied."
2,Outer coating peals off,The outer coating starts pealing off the second day you use the pan. The inner coating is good. But it starts looking ugly with white and black surface on the outer side.
2,Peeling paint all over my kitchen!,"This was one of my Christmas gifts and I'm very disappointed. The paint started peeling in strips off the bottom of the pans after the first use. Now, the paint is peeling from the sides as well. I always thought Farberware was a good brand but I will not purchase again after looking at all the reviews, even from several years ago, and the unresponsiveness from the company."
3,spend a few extra dollars,"This cookware set is OK, but it would be my recommendation that you spend a few extra dollars to get a better quality set. The finish has already started to peel off the outer ring of the pans. One took a hard scratch outside and looks rough, but they are definitely non-stick and perform well."
2,Farberware cookware,"Cheaper quality than expected, lids didn't fit snuggly, was extremely bad on the largest one. Was given as a Christmas gift and I was embarrassed by it."
3,"Farberware Clear Benefits 14-Piece Cookware Set, Black",Product is OK. Pots are smaller than expected. Most sets come with the large pot bigger than 4-1/2-quart size and I would recommend you look for that. After buying this I am now looking for the 5-quart or larger that is a more useful pot.
5,Faberwear clear benefits 14 piece cookware set,I have used this set for 6 weeks and have been very happy with the performance.
4,Decent stuff,"Farberware cooking products are known for their durability and service. I have been using the farberware 14 piece cookware for about 3 months now. The product is fantastic except that the powdercoating at the bottom of the pans has partially peeled off (probably because i have a coiled stove top and it grinds away some paint on metal to metal contact). Well, so far the teflon coating is intact and i suppose its going to last a long time.I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in a complete set of cookware at an affordable price."
3,Average container with a tight lid,I purchased these containers for my daughter's homemade baby food...here are teh pros and consPros-fun colors-size is great and allows for a variety of portion sizes as my baby grows-lids fit nicely and are very tight and minimize the risk of food leaking out into her diaper bag-dishwasher safe...top shelf onlyCons-not microwave safe....completey melts in the microwave
5,There is only one way...Bravo Dan OBerry,If you are a fan of inde films...This is it... An instant classic... Every time I viewed it I found a new twist. Reminiscent of Tarrantino with good humor... I LOVED IT...
1,Less than meets the eye,"I bought this game thinking it would be great fun to play with like-minded people (fellow nerds) but I was quickly proven wrong. The game was poorly designed and a lot of time was spent trying to work out what was supposed to be what. For instance, the colours on the 'properties' were wrong. The board was made of cheap, thin cardboard which meant it couldn't be folded up like a proper Monopoly board. Some 'properties' were completely made-up and not from any of the Transformers series I know. I didn't buy it from Amazon but it's the exact same edition so I decided to review it here as people need to know what they're buying. I was extremely disappointed and we quickly abandoned the game in favour of the original series on DVD."
4,Pretty Good...,The pewter pieces are are too small. That ends the negative portion of this review. I'm glad to see this wasn't just a reprint of the original game like so many other monopoly games. They actually incorporated some new rules. They do add another dimension of play without taking away from the things that make monopoly popular. It will be worth the money if you are in to transformers.
5,I love it,"This is original, G1 Transfomers. Monopoly is always a classic game to get and it is almost worth the price just for the little metal pieces alone.I love this, it was my favorite version of monopoly for quite a long time, but has been surpassed by The Simpson version I think.There are some different optional rules that you can play for a little twist involving the sides, Autobots vs. Decepticons.If you ever had the original toys, do you remember the red card thing that came with them so that you could see their stats on the packaging? That is in this to read the Chance and CC cards. That is a fun idea and if you are a Transformers fan, you have to check this out."
1,Pastry Brush horrors,A Very bad product the bristles came out on my food and the whole end came off. Made in China what should I have expected. 0 stars
4,Makes the connection,"This short, quick read eloquently and simply makes the connection between child abuse and neglect and the behaviors that often result. An especially good read for youth workers, teachers, childcare workers and others who need to understand what drives the anger and maladaptive behavior of some youth and need skills to effectively help these youth and those affecting/affected by their behaviors. This little book's value is high, as well, for those who advocate for youth and those with the power to design and fund appropriate prevention and interventions."
5,Great Mix of Lessons and Videos,"This book provides the best way to learn InDesign outside of a classroom; it may even be better than that. Deke explains how his course runs, then provides helpful instructional materials and exercises that are delivered with a common-sense approach that is easy to understand.The DVD that is included with the book was very helpful. It shows you each step of a lesson and you can replay it as many times as you wish. You won't have classroom instructors doing that. Then, after viewing the video lesson, you go to the book for a step-by-step detail on how InDesign works.Deke's method of instruction is clear, understandable and logical. After I worked with this book I was so sold on Deke's abilities as an instructor that I bought his book on Adobe's Photoshop.I can't give a higher recommendation; he knows how to teach and has written a tremendous book on InDesign."
2,Too much Talk not Enough Lesson,"A disappointing book that is not specific enough and you spend too much time searching for answers.McClelland tries to be a comedian while teaching his lesson's but it turns out to be blah blah blah. In all fairness he gives some pointers that could be helpful but too much time is spent on blather and not enough on the mechanics of the software. It's like watching a cliff hanger, he stops just short of giving you the information he promises but in this case you have to go and find the answers yourself or do his silly exercises that are time consuming to learn anything.I am new to page layout and need specific answers to the mechanics of the program which I found this book to be frustrating to work with. I ended up getting a different book and am learning Indesign mostly without frustration."
4,A good book for children,It's a good book for children to learn more about Chinese tales and the illustration is attractive.
3,"Decent., but...","Decent book, well illustrated...although many of the stories have very weak plot points which doesn't make this a truly interesting read. My daughter loves reading books, but this definitely is her least favorite."
5,Barry White's sexy voice would ignite the passion in anyone,"One of my favorite CD's. Barry White's soulful, sexy voice would make for a night of passion for anyone. We all know what the songs are about but they way Barry sings is an automatic turnon. The bonus is the the CD includes tracks from the Love Unlimited Orchestra as well."
3,Disappointed,"Not the best collection of his songs...it was okay, but I only recognized a few pieces on this CD."
3,A few gems,"This cd has a few songs I'd hate to do without, but many of the songs are just hollow knockoffs of the truly inspired tunes. I wouldn't sit and listen to this straight through (as I would with nearly any Marvin Gaye disk), but I'm still glad to have it in my collection"
5,"Barry is gone but his ""mistress"" lives on...","The man was a genius. Nothing more, nothing less. Hello?? He couldn't read music! Yet he wrote & produced so much! Brilliant.... and we have yet to truly honor him. Pity..."
3,Good selection of Barry White songs,Songs in this album are great -- a good cross section of his hits. (Too bad the CD has one track that skips)
4,Essential Listening for Retired Shepherds,"The recipe of love: a few glasses of vino, a few scented candles, a slightly burned Judo costume and, of course, Barry White. Every time I seduce a lady, you can't keep Barry White off my stereo. Which is probably why it is smashed to pieces. Every time I hear Barry's sweet, sweet voice, I feel like shrinking myself to the size of an ant, with a special ray, and making a home out of an old babies shoe. This album invokes such powerful feelings in me. Whenever I hear ""Love's Theme"" I feel like I have fell in love with a cement mixer, all over again. The first time I made love to a mammoth skeleton, Barry White was on the radio. Again, whilst making love to a Trilby, I slipped on a teabag. Say no more. Barry White is the man."
1,Abundatrade disappointing,Don't know if I like or not received in 3 pieces (Vendor:Abundatrade)(NOT GOOD) not good experience trying to get replaced as well.....
5,Posers.,"What stopped you from buying this collection before? Stop taking things for granted, you might regret it one day. Did you ever go to a Barry White concert? No? Well it's too late now. Morons. Ask yourself, why am I buying this now?"
3,repititious,"I was hoping to find some uniqueness in Barry's music, but on listening to the samples, I was disappointed to hear alot of similar music and monotone and lyrics throughout. Tooo bad."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THE CD IS FINE MUSICALLY; HOWEVER, I THOUGHT IT HAVE DIFFERENT SONGS ON HERE. IT DOES HAVE A VARIETY OF BARRY WHITE SONGS"
2,B&C Eagle 2x.113 28 degree wire col. nail,"The nails appear to be fine, but for some reason they don't work in my Campbell-Hausfeld framing nailer. Longer nails work fine, but this shorter nail causes the gun to jamb. The nail gun is listed to work with these nails, but it doesn't. So I had to revert back to using 10d nails."
5,THIRD WORLD COUNTRY,"AMAZON, AND EBAY, ARE ONE BIG GARAGESALE, IN OUR BEAUTIFUL THIRD WORLDSLOWLY BECOMING SOCIALIST COUNTRY.BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT, THANK YOU FOR THEMUSKETEERS, BOTH, GREAT MOVIES.GOD BLESS, AND LET FREEDOMRING AGAIN, SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE. . ."
2,Slapstick comedy,"Warning. This movie is a parody of the book. If you where inspired by and loved the adventures of D'Artagnan in the book, do not watch this movie. I had to turn the movie off in disgust after 20 minutes. It is a goofy slapstick comedy. There is nothing wrong with comedy. But when it's based on a book with the caliber of romantic heroes such as D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - that is a crime.Alexander Dumas wrote two great books; The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. I encourage you to read the books instead of watching the movies.The Three Musketeers (Barnes & Noble Classics)The Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)"
4,The Incomplete Musketeers,"So, why is this called The Complete Musketeers when it lacks Lester's third film in the series, The Return of the Musketeers?Don't be deceived. I complain because the third film is a worthwhile addition to a great entertainment."
5,"Action, Adventure and Classic","This is my favorite adaptation of this Duma's classic. The outstanding ensemble of actors were superb. The granduer of the palaces and commoness of all else were well portrayed. A country boy, bedazzled by the new world he has stepped into, yet his desire to do right, along with the mentoring of the mature musketeers, enables him to grow into the hero Dumas created. He is lauded by those he saved and respected by his enemies.Would like to see the ""Return of the Musketeers"" release May 30, 2000 be put on DVD."
4,Classic movie,I remember this movie when it came out years ago. It was funny then and it is funny now. Raquel Welch is the bomb.The costumes are incredible.
3,Musketeers review,"Good classic with a very realistic feel to it and some excellent humour. Great acting. Sometimes a bit dated, particularly the sound track."
2,Disappointing,"The lack of English sub-titles was extremely disappointing, specially for a price like this.We have some non-native english speakers and someone hard of hearing here.For all of them it was impossible to follow the dialoques and thus enjoy the movies.The Complete Musketeers (The Three Musketeers / The Four Musketeers)"
5,Outstanding adventure films!,"I remember when this version of ""The Three Musketeers"" was due to be released in the 70's...it was promoted as being more realistic in the atmosphere, attire and weaponry use of the time depicted. It hits square on in all these areas! The more gritty atmosphere (along with the dirt and sweat!)is more realistic than the polished squeaky clean appearance of the actors in the earlier Three Musketeer movies. The use of daggers along with the swords in the fighting sequences and the physical exertion in the swordplay is also more accurately depicted. Oliver Reed, Michael York, Charleton Heston, Christopher Lee, Richard Chamberlain, Faye Dunaway, Raquel Welch...what a cast!!! a truly outstanding adventure/action film, a true classic! So much superior to the remake with Charlie Sheen and Keifer Sutherland. Get this set as the inclusion of The Four Musketeers makes it perfect! Five stars++++++!"
5,Five Stars for the Three Musketeers,"Agree with the other reviewers who said this is by far and away the finest film adaptation of Dumas' classic book. The script is intelligent and witty, the action superb, the actors excellent. The adaptations made after this are third rate but this one shines. Charlton Heston, in a small role, is the perfect Cardinal Richelieu. Thought the only flaw was Michael York's casting as D'Artagnan. He did a good job but just didn't really think he fit in the role. But others may well disagree.A sparkling, wonderful film."
5,The (now) Complete Musketeers,"Of course these are 5 star films so I'll just comment on the new release 2 DVD set. The picture and sound quaity is GREATLY improved over the fox/lorber release and both films are presented in their CORRECT widescreen with The Four Musketeers offering a choice of pan n scan or widescreen. Includes great current day interviews with Heston, Lee, Welch, York, Salkind among many others on the making of the film. Even the 'two movies' dispute is discussed in detail by all!! Nice packaging, great interviews and improved transfer makes this a must for upgrade. Too bad Return wasn't included. If you havent seen these films get set for a real treat. I wish I could go back and see them for the first time again. They don't make 'em like this anymore..."
5,Really liked this movie!,"I seen these two movies many years ago, when they first came to the theaters. (1973-74) It was exactly the way I remembered it! Nice movies that is perfect for the family. It has plenty of sword fighting, romance, humor, and action/adventure.Many of the current movies today have a lot of blood and gore, and bad language. These Musketeers movies have none of that. My ten year old and I really enjoyed watching it together."
3,does not have the last one,the third movie is the return of the musketeers. it takes place 20 years after the first two. i have been looking for it so i could have a COMPLETE musketeers. there are other movies that will never make it to dvd. that is a shame.
2,Nowhere near as good as the book,"I always read that this was a good adaptation of the book. Sadly, I was incredibly dissapointed. Storylines are cut too much, and the characters lack exposure. Not worth it."
3,Disappointed,"I bought these for my 9th floor bay view office. On nice days I like to look out at the boats on Bellingham Bay. My old pair finally ""froze up"" so I ordered these thinking the zoom feature would be nifty. Perfectly serviceable binocs but the zoom feature (in my opinion) is a total bust."
4,Great information!,This book is full of great information for sure. Wagner knows his material and conveys it very well to the reader. As another reviewer mentioned however the amount of typos in this book is astounding and gets a bit annoying page after page.
2,"Slow as Xmas, Buggy Video","Do not buy this if you are planning to run Linux. The onboard intel video is buggy with xorg, and can't get any other card to even boot it. I seriously doubt that there are too many of these around for sale any more; the only reason I am even messing with this boat anchor is my boss, who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing bought it from a local shop who laughed all the way to the bank. Just say he was 2/3 of the way to a new box from walmart with Win7. This unit won't run XP correctly; no amount of effort ever got it to recognize network printer; Lucid goes into login loop with onboard video unless running at 16 bit, and the unit crashes frequently due to video issues. Good as a door stop."
4,nice computer,"i just got this persario,and like it very welleven though i'm renting to own big$$ for ithas a nice audio sound card for gaming and musicvery fast and very reliable..don,ohio..."
5,Helped Me A Lot,"This video helped me a lot with my technique. I used to get sore and tired after massaging. I still do, but it's much better than it used to be because of some of the tips. The picture quality isn't the best but the information is top rate. It starts with some overall principles, then goes into specifics, exercises (which I haven't tried), and other useful tips. It also comes with a two page worksheet that helps to focus on exactly what you possibly need to adjust. I would've liked to have seen more examples while working on an actual person though. Other than that the video is great."
5,hydrate!,"Not well known, but excellent, lightweight and quiet (non sloshing) canteen. Note, requires cover. Great for field trialers and people who need to carry a lot of water comfortably"
3,"Great, but leaky","Great for running for hiking, easier to store and carry than some of the tall cylindrical metal canteens.+Doesn't dent like those metal bottles or canteens+Can take a beating+Easy to pack away-Leaks at the cap-Plastic taste added to the water no matter how many washesI use this canteen on runs and hikes and I like it because unlike my Sigg or Klean bottles that dent or scratch, this thing just shrugs it off. The only thing I would add to it is a rubber or silicon layer to the cap to prevent leaking, a piece to attach the cap to the canteen, a material (don't ask me for what kind, that's one for the research and development department) to coat the inside of the canteen to prevent the plastic taste."
4,Canteen,"Recieved this canteen not to long ago. It holds quite a bit of water, so it is also large. Fits right on my backpack though. Great for hikes and Search and Resuce Excersises. Soft, durable plastic. Only downside is that it will leak if filled close to the top and left on its side. Other than that I would recomend this item. Came within time and I wasnt disappointed."
1,DO NOT BUY,This bottle combines the space of a water bladder with the durability of a water bottle. It is a little bit more space efficient than the G.I. 1 quart bottle. It is very easy to clean (just empty the water out of the canteen and put the canteen down on a cloth or a carpet for a quick drying) so it is easy to manage at a campsite. HOWEVER this water bottle has many MASSIVE downsides to it. #1- It leaks badly. #2- Any scratches make the canteen look bad. #3- The bottle has a horrid design which makes it difficult to hold and store. I would not recommend this for any person or any sports. I would have rated this 0.1/10 but there is not an option for that on this website.
4,Metamatics - Spook Tinsel Shoal,"SPOOK TINSEL SHOAL brings more Metamatics to a wider audience, and that's never a bad thing. Many of the tracks on this album were released on hard-to-find 12""s on District Six, so it's to Hydrogen Dukebox's credit that they actually cared enough to retrieve the tracks and present them. And there's plenty to be grateful for: the quiet shuffle and muttering on ""Toy Toy"" or the robo-beatbox on ""Somekind."" As a whole, the album is certainly more subdued than some of his other work; ""India Link"" thrums with a shivery tension, while ""Dayglo Tinsel"" patters along. ""Jakemond"" seeps in electronic drizzle, and ""Halshanger Cross"" rides out to the Wild West on a Morricone-influenced theme. An album suited for quiet nights and hangovers."
5,Great getaways for the armchair traveler!,"As it states... 70 one-half hour shows are in this set. The picture is crisp and clear. The most recent years (I think 2005-2007) are filmed in high definition so the picture quality is exceptional.The focus is on the highlights of each region and the beauty of the places and the local culture. You'll learn a few words in each language and learn about some regional foods, and history. These shows are jam-packed with education, but they make you feel like you're taking a leisurly 30 minute vacation.I watch 2 of these shows every morning before work, before the kids wake up. I love relaxing and soaking in these shows each morning. I'm sure you'll enjoy them too."
4,Worth the price,"Steve Ricks gives great advice to well groomed travelers. meaning, if you like cruise ships and whirl wind group tours, and grand hyatt hotels this may seem a little too adventorous. But if you consider a visit abroad is more than a history lesson, it is best to stay local, on your own at your own pace, affordable , steve gives excellent advice on where to stay, how to get around (mostly rail) and things you need to see to realy experience the land. If you plan on visting several of eurpoes countries, it's worth buying the complete set. And any you don't need, sell on ebay.If you haven't watch steve, look on PBS stations or rent one from the libray prior to this investment. But it is WELL WORTH getting the complete set"
4,A good book!,"This was a good book! You'll love the heartwarming story of Tom and Elizabeth as they face a trial that could destroy their marriage. But I too, was a little disturbed at the graphic sexual sequences. After all I believe there should be a difference between romance novels and Christian romance novels. I mean, just look at Phillipians 4:8. Yes I know that God has designed a husband and a wife to have that type of an intimate relationship. But I just think the book could've been a little less graphic. But aside from that, though, it was a pretty good book. I thought it had a good story line, even though at times I felt like sceaming at Elizabeth for not believing that Tom loved her even though he continually did things to prove his love to her. Anyway this would have been a wonderful book if it would've been just a little less graphic."
5,A Wonderful Sequel,"This is the sequel to In Honor Bound, and I think it my favorite of DeAnna Julie Dodson's books. The ending in particular is extremely touching. The plot for this book is very intriguing, and I love how the author never puts in any details that will not be significant to the main plot. Consequently, it's very difficult to put the book down!"
5,Custine is Russia's De Tocqueville,"I am Russian, and I agree without reservation with those who have said that de Custine did for Russia what de Tocqueville did for America. That is, although he took his trip before the Russian Revolution and even before the country had begun to modernize and industrialize in earnest, he picked up on something so fundamental about the land and its people that it is still recognizably there today. You would have to read the book to figure out what that is, and the czar's autocracy, mentioned by the previous reviewer, has a lot to do with it even though today's czars are elected. From that standpoint, de Custine's subtitle, ""A Journey Through Eternal Russia,"" is literally true: he saw through the external and the accidental to the eternal."
5,Very useful,"The booklets are useful in group discussions and that even members who have been in church life for 30 years learned from them. The writer has a way of keeping things practical, down to earth, yet speaks from his spirit. He can impart truth with few words. Makes a GREAT gift set for a newly baptized person."
5,Everything as Advertised,"Everything was as advertised. I am pleased with my product, and will shop here again."
1,Waste of time and money.,"The Bosch power tool battery I ordered from D-Lowlic never arrived at the correct address I provided; instead, the postoffice returned it to D-Lowlic and they refused to send me a replacement??? Amazon issued me a credit for the $30.00 cost of the battery right away. Neither reimbursed me for the $9.99 shipping costs."
4,Great,"Growing up in NYC in '95 -ish...this is a must own...wish they would've gotten some more bands in there....especially Sick Of It All, but if you get the DVD, Lou can explain that.Definitely worth it"
5,I'm in middle school all over again,"This is a totally amazing NYHC doc to own. For someone who grew up as a SXE kid going to shows and being part of the scene, this movie has been like a flash back to those I have met, those who have inspired me, and those that i just flat out have been scared of. NYHC is well worth every second and a must own for any DMS/NYHC fan."
5,"I DIDN'T GET THEM AND YOU SAY THAT YOU WILL REFUND THEM. IDON'T WANT TO BE REFUND , WANT IT TO BE SEND TO ME",YOUDIDN'T SEND MY ORDER . YOU SAID THAT YOU WILL REFUND MY ORDER - WHY? - I WANTMY ORDER. DO YOU KNOW HAW HARD IS TO GET THME FROM GREECE? WHY YOU SEND ME WITH NO PROBLEM THE ''SOULFLY'' DVD? PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT MY ORDER.
4,erps-- amending my proviso,"well, I do like her version of o holy night-- it's come all ye faithful i didn't dig. however, i still find this to be an amazing xmas album-- i listen to it, a charlie brown xmas, on yoolis night by the anonymous four, and robert shaw chorale's voices of angels. so, this album has classic company! oh yes, it was xmas 94 that i finally met donna-- while we both were buying xmas ornaments! she's very nice and smart."
5,The Best!,Donna had the best voice....truly a great talent...so glad she made this collection....love it! She was more than just a disco singer...her passing leaves a deep void in the music world
2,Does not work for me,"Did not care for this product. My female a month late coming in heat, used for a month and nothing.Thought this would regulate her.I think it is a big waste of money."
3,A poignant story,"Admissions is a sweet movie with a serious tone. Ambrose is great (as always). Llyod who I usually like, is a little awkward in his role. Overall it's an interesting and enjoyable movie."
3,"1000 questions, huh...","This game is fun, but some of the questions are, well, more than obscure. To answer every question, you'd not only need to know everything viewable in the movie, but also the biographies of the stars, the trailers, the 19th hole 20th anniversary feature, etc. The range of questions is vast. You might know that Danny's last name is Noonan, but do you know what color Dr. Beeper's shoe laces were during the big match (not really one of the questions)?All of that said, it's fun for a group to play--like on that Golf week in Myrtle Beach with the boys."
2,PRAXIS/CST Health Education (National Teacher Examination series) (National Teachers Examination Series #38),"The book provides ample sample questions with answers; however, the content does not reflect the information on NY State's CST in Health Education."
4,Suitable Review Source,"Series of questions included in this book are suitable for preparation for any certification exam leading to a teaching license in this discipline. Worth the investment for any test taker who is a little ""anxious""."
2,Why?,Why do some books have to be semi-wonderful and keep me captivated before getting me confused? Why did I care about Rachel and her spunky/wild temper and then slowly lost interest in her story? Why does the major plot sort of slip off the edge of the ending and leave me wondering why it was so important to hear about the fires in detail?This has been one of those books where the author needed filler material so she used metaphors and I found them pretty but overdone. Rachel feels trapped like a butterfly in her dad's collection. She wants to be a vet...but in her time and place it was a man's job in a man's world. The city of Boston is on fire and the firehorses at the fire station have caught distemper.I liked the story in loose terms...but beyound the surface there was too much to detract from its good points. The story and characters seemed detached at times.*note: this is probably my first horse book...I look foward to becoming familier with the genre*
5,YOUNGER GENERATION LEIPZIG SCHOOL,"I bought this album on Archiv LP some years ago, and it has been a favorite of mine ever since. Getting it on CD was something I had been trying to do for several years. If you like the Gunther Ramin, Wilhelm Ehmann and Karl Richter style of cantati, this is probably the best collection of the secular cantati available. Unfortunately, none of those three recorded very much of the non-sacred choral music of Bach. Peter Schreier's conducting (and tenor voice and choral experience), the Kammerorchester Berlin, and the other soloists make this a superb recording as well as a good reference recording."
4,Bach secular cantatas set,I received my order of the J.S. Bach: Complete Secular cantatas in a timely manner and am very satisfied.
4,A decent headset,"The sound quality is good, the mike works well for dictation. However, it gets uncomfortable to wear after a while. My ears start to hurt and get sore despite the padding. Nonetheless, it's a very nice headset. Just be aware you can't wear it for hours on end without some discomfort."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST,BUT STILL VERY GOOD!","WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS HOW SOME REVIEWS I HAVE READ,PEOPLE PUT THIS BOOK DOWN AND DEPLICTS THE WRONG INFORMATION ON ITS STORY. HERE IS WHAT IT IS ABOUT! IT IS NOT ALL ABOUT THE LUTZES HAUNTED ATTACKS. YES THERE IS ENOUGH HERE TO PLEASE YOU. BUT MORE ABOUT THE AFTERMATH TO THE STORY OF THEY'RE UNBILIEVABLE 28 DAYS IN 112 OCEAN AVE. THIS BOOK COVERS WHY GEORGE SOLD THE FAMILY BUISNES,HOW THE ATTACKS CONTINUED,WHY THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH,ALL THE HOWS AND WHYS CONCERNING THE BOOK BEING WRITTEN.HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THE NEGATIVE PRESS SURROUNDING THEM,THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THEM TRYING TO ENSURE PEOPLE THE STORY IS TRUE! SO IT ABOUT HOW THEY HAVE HANDLED EVRYTHING AFTER THEY FLED 112 OCEAN AVE. TO CLEARIFY THEY'RE STORY BETTER! WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO DETERMIN IF THE STORY IS TRUE OR NOT, WE WE WERE NOT THERE. BESIDE IT DOES MAKE A GREAT HORROR STORY ANYHOW!"
2,Amityville II: The Possession,"Amityville II: The Possession explains in detail the tragedy of the DeFeo Murders. The author caught and kept my eye by using real facts, court transcripts and actual research about the events. He also has a background in psychology which helps him understand and explain what happened. I would recommend the first half of the book. From that point, it talks about the weird happenings of the Lutz family. Instead of the author speaking, it jumps to another woman explaining what she thinks. The book lost my interest then. Even though the book lost the excitment towards the middle of the story, it was still worth reading if you are interested in this type of happenings."
1,An unconvincing and mediocre ghost story.,"The on going tale of the phony horrors the Lutz family suffered at the hands of a 'demonic force' lacks any feeling of credibility. It's just one melodramatic 'evil event' after another. The most ludicrous sequence being a moment where Father Mancuso does spiritual battle with a satanist in a San Francisco head shop (a scene that reads like something cribbed from a Graham Masterton novel). Only passing references are made to the creation of the first bestselling book, the hit movie adaptation, and, in the most revealing moment of the novel, aiding Ronald DeFeo's defense attorney with the story of their unfortunate experiences (for which all this nonsense was created in the first place, to give the insanity plea supernatural credence - it failed). Of interest only to those brave souls wanting to examine how low some people will go to exploit tragic events to make money. Not recommended AT ALL!"
2,Slow going,"I know I'm 40 years late reading these rabbi detective stories, but even back then there were better mysteries. Too much buildup, and very little mystery. And what an unpleasant buildup: paints a picture of Boston-area Conservative Jewish synagogues which is all infighting and very little Jewish spirit. Even the social activism is described cynically. If you're writing fiction, there could have been other, better things to emphasize. I certainly hope that it was _not_ taken as ""a primer to instruct the Gentile"" (Anthony Boucher, New York Times Book Review, in the book jacket reviews)! Ok, the mystery was clever, with all the clues waiting the moment the first (and only) unsavory character appears. And I admit I read to the end. Maybe others in the series were better."
2,Misleading Title,I bought this book as a present but when it arrived it definitely was not like what I expected. There is only one project design with directions. The rest of the book is just pictures of what other artists have done. Maybe this would be a good book if you are a skilled carver but for a novice it may be difficult to replicate the designs without any directions.
5,Carving Found Wood,"Carving Found Wood: Tips, Techniques & Inspiration from the ArtistsThis book was shipped very quickly and in perfect condition. Great shipper. Any carver or artist would find this book a wonderful read. The carvers in the book are great! They make you want to go search for found wood immediately!"
5,Great Shoes,"I think these shoes are great; very well made and comfortable fit as well, can't wait to get them broken in."
5,great for the price,"I got about a 50 percent discount because I ordered the wide width size. Generally the shoes run from 88 to 110 depending on the shopping source. Great deal, they came right on time in pristine condition. Definitely a good purchase."
1,Poor service/ bad customer service,I ordered the shoe twice Abd both time received an incorrect item. The picture doesn't reflect an actual product. I ordered the new style but received old tie down laces version. I was told that amazon will stop the page until it correct the problem. The page is still up and they are selling wrong items again. Maybe they have old and new styles mixed up in the warehouse and nobody cares to find the correct new style shoe. Unfortunatly they are sold by amazon itself. More time wasted Andre-package two wrong orders and stand in line to drop off the package at the post office.
1,bloodied foot,Went on a day trip with my new Sebago mens spinnaker boat shoes. By the end of the day my right foot was very red and almost bleeding. On looking at the shoe the stiching inside the right shoe was bunched up and causing the shoe nto rub against my foot. Further investigation showed that the right shoe actually was a different shade than the other. Come to find out it was the last pair available. I believe the shoes were returned and than sold to me. How could anyone with a conscience offer a product like that.
3,Beautiful but unconfortable,"I'm very happy with the quality and how nice the shoes look; however, I wouldn't recommend you to wear them ""sockless"" or you will suffer. These are simply the hardest shoes I've ever had in my life... They destroyed my feet :("
1,Made my foot bleed,"Ignoring the comments of one of the reviewer, I went ahead and ordered these shoes, being captivated by their beauty. The item arrived as promised, and looked as good as the picture.However, a 5 minute walk with these shoes made the upper part of the heels (tendons) bleed profusely. I actually didn't realize that the pain I was feeling was already being accompanied by bleeding.I would suggest the manufacturer to look into this, and improve the shoe design from the back, seems the shoe protrudes too much towards the inside and hurts (actually ruptures) the tendons."
1,hurts my feet,"I tried on a party, I felt hurt on both feet and the edge of the shoe cuts my skin and bleeding.The style is nice but it causes so much trouble to me while I couldnt feel comfortable on wearing it.I woulent recommend people buying this shoe."
2,Not what they has been,"I found the shoes unconfortable ,very hard for nubuck leather,they are not what these shoes use to be ,sebago should look at a better manufacture"
5,my goto everyday shoes,I love boat shoes and these have become my favorite. I have several in dif colors. The number of colors available is amazing. Another big plus is that they are available in wide (2E).
3,"way too big,","the shoes were nice ,the colour everything , just as the picture showed , however the size I ordered which is my sons normal size ,12 were way too big for him. Luckily my husband was a size bigger and they fit ok, a bit snug but....and that saved me from returning them. The seller should indicate that you need to get a size down from your normal size when ordering this shoe."
2,Disappointment,"I'm sorry,I wasn't satisfied,I ordered and expecting it was a leather as it states in the order online but unfortunately it was made of suade....very disappointed.Amazon gave me a replica;I won't be ordering shoes anymore online.."
4,SEBAGO SPINNAKER,These shoes are well made but the sizing is a little tighter than other Sebago's I own.Overall though a nice shoe.
5,solekool,"When my shoes came in mail, I was excited to open the box to see if they fit. I was taken back by the strong smell of fresh leather. So much so... That my excitement to get the shoes on was overwhelming...:-),. Once, I had them on I was solekool. Man...Very smooth soft leather, and the texture appeared to accenuate the shape of my toes. The Girls at the shop loved em. Many compliments....they want to purchase the same thing."
5,G. Stuart,I have found Sebago shoes to be outstanding and the Spinnaker is no exception. Both quality and appearance are excellent.
2,hard shoes,"shoes, hard, rough, uncomfortable to use, they have hurt my feet, and I have almost no use them; regret that a brand like SEBAGO have concessions that discredit, I hope they give me some alternative change, thanks."
2,Fragile Battery Hog,"The title says all I need to say. This is an awesome toy until you tire of unscrewing the door to change the batteries, or until it just gives out. Ours lasted four months. The toy blower is the same story, which supports the notion that it is not just a bad unit."
4,Sweet,Fontanelle are an interesting instrumental band from Portland. Very moody and jazzy with a slight funkiness. The electric piano is great sounding. Picture start is definatley the stand out track. If you like most things on Kranky you will like this.
5,Magnificent and never annoying,"There are many reviews of this CD already. I will only add that this is one of the best bands to come along in the 90's and this is a truly magnificent album. Contrary to the amazon.com review, there is nothing preachy about any of the lyrics. Ecstasy would appear to be a protest song and one with as much power and emotion as you will hear anywhere. If anyone finds it preachy, they should consider listening to the Beach Boys."
5,Earthy rhythems to soothe the soul.,"Whether you just want to relax to the music, or get high with it, you'll love Rusted Root. The earthy tones put a warmth inside you that just plain feels magical. Buy this cd, and anything else by Rusted Root. Great music!"
5,"Something New, Something Old","My recent first encounter with RR was 'Send Me On My Way' which I interpreted as a Byrne/Bono/Paul Simon blend with that kicky world rhythm to keep me moving. I immediately purchased the CD and was further delighted with the diversity of the additional 12 generous tracks. 'Cruel Sun' reminds me of the band 'It's a Beautiful Day' a lifetime ago. Now I've gone and shown my age. A fascinating blend of raw energy , complicated rhythms, and sophisticated writing. One of my new favorites."
5,No need for java now that I own this CD!,"Rusted Root's ""When I Woke"" CD is one of my favorites! DRUM TRIP in the morning will get your blood pumping even before the coffee kicks in...guaranteed! ECSTASY sneaks right in after that to keep you bouncing. Sing along with SEND ME ON WAY, and just when you think you have heard it all...(you haven't) BACK TO THE EARTH envelopes you with a trance-like beat that you can't resist...What a GREAT collection...Try it!! You won't be sorry!!"
5,THIS CD SHOULD BE OWNED BY EVERYONE IN THE WORLD!!,"This cd ROCKS! Anyone who doesn't own it should, and those who own it, should buy another copy! It is different, but in a REALLY good way. I can spend hours listening to the whole cd on repeat, and then go back and listen to ""Martyr"" or ""Send Me On My Way"" for another three hours. If you are into music with a jungle beat, awesome lyrics, and cool back up instruments, you need this cd!!!"
3,Exuberance effort,"A little less spirited than what is attempted, RR's sophomore still proved adept at carving out a somewhat unique sound within the playful realms of jam-world rock-pop. Exuberance effort"
4,This one was a breath of fresh air.,"I was captivated by this album when it was first reccommended to me. I never cared much for Phish, other ""Jam Bands"" producing good music now were still polishing thier act. So along comes this new band that manages to capture live energy on thier record; I was thrilled. I initially overplayed this one and I'll admit I did get tired of it; but I pulled it out a few years later, and it has been in reguar rotation ever since."
5,MY FAVORITE BAND IN THE WHOLE WORLD!,"I have this disc, and, quite simply, I never get tired of listening to it! An impressive debut!"
3,"Pretty good debut, stick with the follow-ups",I find this to be my least favorite of the RR cd's. This album is too worldly and tribal for me. I like their next albums where the songs sound more like songs not just continuous music with singing thrown in to break up the repetitiveness.
4,It's like...,Rusted Root is like Dave Matthews Band with a flute/whistle instead of a saxophone! Or atleast in my opinion...I like it!
3,Cute but not practical,"This watch is very cute for a novelty watch. However, as a floor nurse, it is not very practical. For one thing, Minnie's hand is always pointing to 2, and at quick glance it appears that Minnie's hand is a clock hand, which it is not. The actual clock hands are silver, and very difficult to see. Cute, but not useful on the floor."
2,"Great for counting a pulse, not for telling the time","A silver face with silver hour and second hands is nearly impossible to read. If you catch the light just right, you can tell the time of day.The red sweep second hand is quite visible and useful for counting pulse and respiratory rate.Minnie Mouse is always cool. This is more a fashion accessory than a timepiece."
3,Watch review,"I bought this because I like Minnie Mouse. I find the silver face of the watch too shiney making it difficult to read the hands, and almost impossible to read the second hand."
4,nice boot,nice boot / true to size. love the look and style of these boots. my son thought they were to nice to wear but is finally breaking them in.
3,Great shoe but received two left feet,"I ordered these for my 8 year old son. He was so excited he took them out of the box and tried to put them on only to discover that we were sent two left shoes. Now I am stuck with two left feet. Need to order a second pair, they say only one pair left in his size 4.5, must be two right shoes."
4,Slab 3 Does it better,"1 and 2 were good. But 3 is great. I'd say half the songs on this CD are in my list of underground cuts. 'Slabs on the Rise' is that real underground stuff, every single verse on that song is sick. This CD has a lot of fast lyrics compared to 1, 2 and 4. I say it's for the better. Trae's lyrics seem like they get better with every CD he's on. My favorites on this album are 'Slabs on the Rise', '5 Minutes of Flow', 'Ready 4 War', 'Standing Strong' Does It Better'. This album is really one of those you can just leave running in your basement during a party and everyone will love."
4,good product,"its a great smelling product. this one seams to be a little on the watery side, maybe its just me but I have bought this cologne quite abit from other stores. it will last for a good few hours."
4,Great Value but not my first preference,I brought this cologne as a gift for my father who generally tends to go through a bottle in just a few weeks. He's a heavy sprayer. However I've noticed this bottle has lasted him 4 months now and still going. A few sprays goes a long way. Strong scent at first (not overly musky) but turns into a clean fresh scent that will last a good part of the day. The price is another pro of this product. About $20 on sale can't be beat by many other good colognes. Great Value! The reason I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is because this is not the best I've tried. My personal preference/favorite in cologne is Davidoff's Cool Water.
3,Mixed comments,Most people have told me that they like it but might be too strong for people with sensitive sense of smell.
4,NICE FRAGRANCE,I RECEIVED BAMBOO AS A GIFT AND DECIDED TO TRY THIS. NICE LIGHT FRAGRANCE NOT OVERPOWERING NOT TOO PRICEY BUT MAKES A GREAT IMPRESSION
1,Bora Bora,Actually I still have not received it. Contacted the vendor as well as UPS and still have not heard anything.
2,Curious George pc game,"It is an old version windows 98, it didn't say that anywhere. I did find a way to make it work on my pc, but then I had to uninstall it because it was quirky and would freeze and/or flash from time to time. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have an old pc running windows 95 or 98. It was a cute game when it worked."
5,Marvelous Adaptation of Print to Audio,"Conan Doyle wrote The Valley of Fear in three parts: 1. The Tragedy of Birlstone. 2. A flashback to The Scowrers, and 3. An Epilogue. It had the effect of two separate books united by a commonality of characters and theme. The radio presentation took the tack of of interspersing scenes from The Tragedy of Birlstone with flashbacks to scenes from The Scowrers. One particularly dramatic segue came when the announcement of the murder of Jack Douglas followed immediately upon John McMurdo's oath never to betray the Scowrers on pain of death. I listen to audiobooks as I commute to work. This one made me late for work as I sat in the parking lot listening to the trapping of Birdy Edwards."
5,Classic Doyle,"The last of the four Sherlock Holmes novels, and one of the two best. It contains more detection in its first section than The Hound of the Baskervilles, with Holmes (off-stage for much of The Hound) actively investigating the murder at Birlstone, and drawing his ever-fascinating deductions from raincoats and dumb-bells; indeed it is the only pure detective story among the four, with the reader given every opportunity to solve the crime. Although the solution is justly famous, it is but a variation on ""The Norwood Builder,"" at much greater length. The second half of the tale concerns the doings of the Pinkerton agent Birdy Edwardes in the eponymous Valley, terrorised by the Freemasons, a gripping and powerful account which is perhaps of greater interest than the detection."
5,Super Reader,"This one has Moriarty, what more can you want? When you have the super detective himself, Sherlock Holmes, trying to get to the bottom of what his arch-nemesis, super villain Professor Moriartry is up to, the stage is set for a gripping narrative, as they try and outdo each other, and Watson tries doggedly to follow along."
4,A Great Story That Is Hard To Figure Out - Though Very Short,"The Valley of Fear is the last of the full Sherlock Holmes novels (the remaining books are short story collections) and it is also one of the shortest. Overall, it was more of an extended short story than a full novel. However, it was still very deep in that it was one of the more difficult to figure out the mysteries in the Sherlock Holmes universe. In fact, the last half of the book represents the first Sherlock Holmes story where I wasn't able to figure out what was going on until the end. A fun read that you can complete in a single session."
3,"Half the book is great, the second half is boring","The first half of this classic by Doyle The Tragedy of Birlstone is exciting mystery, Doyle at his absolute best. A wealthy man turns up dead, and Holmes must find his killer, or so everybody thinks. The mystery ends up taking a 180 degree twist, one I never would have predicted. It's absolutely thrilling.The second half of this book The Scrowrers, I'm not even sure why Doyle bothered. It is supposed to be a ""prequel"" to the first half of the book, and it falls flat. Holmes and Watson play only a bit part at the end of the book. I will say this however, the action is fast paced. There is much more violence in this section of the book than I've found in other Holmes mysteries. It does explain some details found in the first half of the book, but in my mind it didn't need to have an entire 100 or so pages dedicated to this detail. You can read the first half of the book and skip the second without feeling like you're missing a thing."
5,The Complete Marriage and Family Home Reference Guide,This is a great book in which Dr. Dobson offers godly advice to parents on a wide range of topics within marriage and the family. I highly recommend it.
1,It's a Complete INVATION of PRIVACY!!!!,"It doesn't surprise me at all that Dobson wants to dig into a girl's private issue regarding her cycles! This sickens me to no end! This man is really into embarrassment and children (especialy females) is his biggest target!Trust me! It is highly unusual for a woman's cycle to be so consistent! There are several factors why a woman can skip her period and it has NOTHING to do with pregnancy! It can be due to stress, change in climate, hormonal imbalances, even a plane, train or boat ride can delay it or have it come early. Dobson should have referred to a MEDICAL BOOK instead of going only on his false assumptions!Now I am surely convinced that the man is a pervert! I wonder how he would approach his daughter when he feels the need to know her private time of the month!"
3,"Read ""Winning with Difficult People"" instead","Try reading ""Winning with Difficult people"" instead of this book. This book did tell me about certain types of people and how to deal with them, but it didn't go into deal about why they are the way they are to others."
1,Working with difficult people,Found the book difficult to follow and read. The book reads more like a dictionary.
3,Wife thought it was OK.......,"The vibrating she said was ok, good to get her excited but there was not enough contact in the right spot to make her well....you know. As for me the cock ring part was effective for keeping things going...a good while but it can numb after long use."
3,"John Coyne, Where Did You Go?","For a while during the late 70's and early 80's, John Coyne's Thriller/Horror books were everywhere. Each book he wrote got better and better: ""The Searing,"" ""The Fury,"" ""The Piercing,"" ""The Shroud,"" and his best, in my opinion, ""Hobgoblin"". Once the 1990s hit, the author seemed to set aside his pen in favor of working with the Peace Corps. While his attention is on a good cause, I'd love to see him come back to writing.Hobgoblin is a fantasy roleplaying game based on ancient Irish mythology. Scott Gardiner is a lonely prep school student who escapes reality every now and then, playing under the guise of his character Brian Boru. The line between reality and fantasy begin to blur as events and creatures from the game begin showing up in the real world.Unfortunately, this book is currently out of print. If you want a book with suspense, a little horror and a little fantasy, this one is definitly worth seeking out."
5,"Role Playing Games, Anyone?","Written back in the days when Dungeons & Dragons was at it's most popular, this is a book about a teenage boy who gets caught up in the character he plays in a role playing game based on Irish mythology. It is a thrill of a book with many twists and turns. The lead character may just be a bit insane but he is not completely off his rocker. The things he sees may not be real but there is deffinately something strange going on in this town he and his mother have come to live in. John Coyne puts together a great tale of seemings and dreamings. What is real? What is fantasy? ""Hobgoblin"" comes to a close with a very satisfying end. All is explained, there are no loose ends. I highly recomend this book."
5,A great escape.,"I first read this book in 1982 and have read it again a few times. Each time I read it I am reminded of just how well it is written. Whether you are into fantasy role playing games or not, this book is a great escape story and a thoroughly enjoyable read. What a nice break from today's formula of retired/fired cop/lawyer/investigator called back to duty to solve the latest murder/kidnapping/white collar crime.The author integrates a unique story line that is easy to read yet intricate enough to hold a mature interest. Anyone from teenagers on up would enjoy this book."
5,Powerful,"As with every production I've ever seen with Domingo, his acting as well as his wonderful voice and musicality provide a powerful experience for the viewer. This opera is no exception. Andrea Chenier is a strong performance with a story that not only makes sense - (many opera stories are just plain silly) but actually provides a sense of history at the same time. I enjoyed this production very much. The supporting cast is also very strong. Production values are good. This is the only opera of Giordano that I've ever seen so I can't compare it. But I thoroughtly enjoyed this one. Domingo with his dramatic intensity was the focal point of this opera. I don't think you'll be disappointed in this opera."
5,One of the Best,"I am 70 years old and have always known about this opera, but I never actually viewed it...I presumed it to be a second or third class ""Puccini"".After seeing this production, I must say that it is on a par with Puccini's Manon Lescaunt if not the on the level of the other big threes of Boheme,Tosca and Butterfly...The famous final duet before the ill fated lovers go to the guillotine is wonderful.The performance is magnificent and features great artists in their prime. The costumes, sets, orchestral playing,and direction are all as you might expect from a Covent Garden production."
4,Nutrition for Vegetarians ~ Review,"After reading this book, I decided that it was my final choice to become a vegetarian. This offered lots of helpful information and tips for meals and such. I suggest this book."
4,A different feel on an old sound by classically trained noise musicians,the experience of the members emmanates from their sound and Whitney's voice lend in some texture to the sound.It's a beautiful blend of all these guys talents that come welded together from The Locust and The Blood Brothers and gives you a lot of respect for their talent in sound and lyrics.
5,This is a great book..,I just loved this story..Not only is it a love story.It is funny...It also goes to show you never judge a book by it's cover or what someone else tells you about another person.Also shows you how friends stick togther when one gets hurt but also how strong love is.I hope other readers enjoy this book as much as i did.
5,ALL CALVIN AND HOBBES BOOKS,"I THINK THAT EVERYONE WOULD ENJOY THESE BOOKS IF YOU ARE A COMIC STRIP LOVER!!!! I LOVE THEM!!!!! THEY ARE FUNNY, AND VERY ENTERTAINING!!!!! I ONLY WISH THAT BILL WATTERSON WOULD PROBUCE MORE OF THESE COMIC STRIPS. CALVIN AND HOBBES ROCK!!!!!!"
4,MISSING 1 CLASSIC HIT,"This cd is a great cd to purchase but!However without the original recorded version of ""Summer Maddness"" I feel that the cd is incomplete. When I retire I will put your favorite compiliations together the way they should be. For example would you buy Parliament's greatest hits without P-Funk,Rick James greatest hits without ""Mary Jane"" etc etc. Well that's how I feel every time I see a Kool and the Gang cd without haveing Summer Maddness added to the cd. Im out, your's truly the Musicologist."
3,The Penultimate Collection,"I actually give this 3-CD collection 3.5 stars. CD 1 will teleport to the great times of the 70's and 80's. CD 2 incorporates more synthesizers and has more of a rock 'n roll feel. If they had left songs like ""Straight Ahead"", ""Peacemaker"", ""Rags To Riches"" and ""Strong"" off of the second CD and added the three missing classics, ""Summer Madness"", ""Hollywood Swinging"" and ""Open Sesame"", I would have given this CD collection 5 stars. CD 3 provides hipper (remix) versions of a couple classic tunes. Thus, this not the ultimate collection but the penultimate collection. Still, it's a nice CD."
1,Never received Item!,Will never purchase anything again. Never received item purchased over a month ago and never received any reply message after sending them a message.
1,"cd ""Celeration The Beast of Kool & the Gang""",The CD does not have a very good sound. I play it on my Bose and it sounded terriable.
4,Here is a track list,"Below is the track list with the Billboard 100 peak position and year.1. Celebration (#1 - 1980)2. Get Down On It (#10 - 1982)3. Fresh (#9 - 1985)4. Too Hot (#5 - 1980)5.

5,dancin dancin dancin,if you don't like this cd then you don't like music!!! a must to add to your collection no matter your age!
5,The soundtrack of the mid 70's to late 80's!,"This edition of Kool & the Gang excelled in the uptempo songs that crossed over to the Pop Charts, and this CD features everything you need to hear from this era. The group changed direction in 1979 when J.T.Taylor came on board for 'Ladies Night'. After that 1979 hit, Kool & the Gang seemed to always be on the charts, and the notable hits are here!I'd also recommend Kool & the Gang's 1969-1976 Funk Essentials CD (featuring 'Jungle Boogle', 'Open Sesame', 'Summer Madness', and more from the 70s!). This way , you can have the entire Kool & the Gang story. They're much more than 'Ladies Night' & 'Celebration'..they are without question, some of the founding fathers of funk music!"
3,Hard to open,"I love the CorningWare French White line and own a dozen other pieces. Many of those came with pliable, well-fitting rubbery covers. This set has covers of a different type which are very hard for me to remove, especially without spilling liquid contents. The bowls and cups are all usable so there is function in those, but we use covers from other products we have for storing foods in them. By the way, we had no damage in shipping."
2,ew,"Ok let's be real here, butchers are not hot!I mean it had good descriptions but when I'm trying to read an erotic novel, i don't wanna hear about meet being sliced and blood dripping.Just sayin"
3,Naked and Lustful,"It was a typical movie of that time period. The acting was bad, as well as the music. But I purchased it only for Rutger Hauer being in it and didn't enjoy it because his voice was dubbed."
2,Could Be Better,"I'm a little surprised that all of the other reviewers have given this 5 stars, I could barely make it to the end of the book. I'm a huge fan of travel books, so I had high expectations. The author uses language well, but goes off on so many tangents that you quickly forget what the chapter is even supposed to be about. Each chapter is supposed to be about a certain memory or theme, but instead he will start off telling one story, then switch to a seemingly unrelated Hindu legend, then to another story, then on to something else. If the thoughts were better organized, it could be a good book, but instead it left me feeling dizzy trying to keep up with the random twists and turns of focus."
3,agnostic grinds to a holt and madball appears!?,after roger merit serves time and puts AF on hold him and freddy and several AF members decide it's time to release the first cd from their closet project of years back(i guess they never thought it would be this well received)at the time it wasn't but in 94 set it off was and this is like a demo of set it off and other songs but this one had roger on bass not hoya.this is the earliest and best incarnation of madball(ball of destruction was AF with freddy singing-not their best hours)
2,Miss information,"The tiny switch selector 110/220 v placed directly on the plug has caused me to full up my house with smoke, after I heard a big bang... There is no notice about this selector in the product manual, so if you will not see this selector, you will end blownig up the charger, as I did. Watch out!"
1,Transformer blew up in Europe,The presence of a 110/220 Volt selector switch is not obvious. The transformer promptly blew up when plugged into 220V while traveling in Europe.
3,Not as Good As Lithum Batteries,The Power 2000 XP 444AC-DC NiMH Rechargeable AA Batteries do not last as long in my camera as the original lithum battery that was included when purchased. As this product comes with 4 AA batteries; and my camera only requires 2; I always have another set charged and ready to go. If I didn't have the backup batteries I would be disaapointed in the short battery life of this product in digital camera use. One plus is that the batteries do charge quickly (1 hour or less) in the charger.
4,rare stuff,"by their own ranking system (in the lists book) this c.d. would rate pretty low as hardly any of this stuff is really essential to a well rounded ""history of rap"" collection. But that's not the point, the good folks at ego trip (bonz malone excepted) have provided us with a nice little collection of hard to find on c.d. (where did all my vinyl go?)if your like me, snatch it up."
3,Not for the novice!,"Written on the cover of this book is the claim to be ""The Official Guide"" for Paradox 9. The introduction says it has material for the beginner and then two paragraphs later it tells you about the things that are left out and that beginner-level books should consulted. This is a good book for intermediate users, but if your a novice, there's no way to tell that this book can't help you until after you buy it. That add's up to money wasted."
1,Know What You're Getting,"I suspect that most people who buy this book already believe 99% of what's in it. For those who are looking for an objective, common-sense way of dealing with teenage cultural issues, this isn't it. The author starts out well enough, pointing out numerous examples of manipulative and over-sexualized advertising and programming aimed at kids and teens, but by the middle of the book, her extreme right-wing agenda is so obvious, it's hard to keep reading. Being slammed over the head page after page with self-righteous hogwash just isn't my idea of parenting advice. The author is so self congratulatory about her efforts at keeping her teenagers home and apart from anything their peers might be experiencing, it makes you wonder how these poor kids are ever going to survive on their own. I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get past the blatent manipulation of facts and figures to further her own extreme messsage."
1,Don't Bother,"This book is boring, repetitive, and not at all insightful. The author describes some problems with our culture- too much sex and violence- but offers no thoughtful suggestions. She basically talks about what a great parent she is because she generally shields her children from such odious things as Janet Jackson's nipple.Lastly, I don't understand why an editor didn't delete the completely overused phrase "" a culture that has gone stark raving mad.""Waste of time and money."
1,Godawful,"I never abuse books. But I made an exception of this one and just threw it in the garbage. It is just awful. The woman offers no constructive solutions except the platitudinously inane call for ""goldly families"". I enjoy a good right wing ranting tome most days of the week, but this one is just so bad, so devoid of ideas and lacking in ""values"", you just want to weep. All you get is her litany of ""the bad stuff"" which in her mind is coming out of the cultural woodwork and her one idea to strengthen your family by finding ""Jeezus"".The only time this woman might could come close to intellectual rigor would be if she died in a library."
5,Excellent Information,Rebecca Hagelin addresses many aspects of everyday life where families are bombarded by negativity and a culture of corruption. Her no-nonsense attitude and pratical advice is perfect for families across the nation.
4,Everyone should read this book!,"Whether you have children or not you should read this book. Everyone should know and be thinking about ways to help our children, nieces, nephews and friends to fight back in a world where anything goes and goodness doesn't prevail. Anything you want, you can get, no matter the price. Materialism is valued and moms and dads are taken away from what really matters, to pay for all this stuff.This book is chalk full of resources for everything you could imagine. I myself am going to check out magazines for young ladies. Great book, well written and one to be pulled out to be re-read!"
2,The presentation here is lacking.,"Ms. Hagelin's points may be valid: The need to set boundries for our kids, the need to shield our young children from overly sexualized media, and that values taught in public schools have shifted radically over the last 40 years. Hagelin also strives to stress that parents must take responsibility to be their children's primary role models.But the casual format of this book often rambles without scoring direct hits on the points she tries to make. The repeated use of the phrase ""stark raving mad"" was enough to drive me batty.A cleaner outline - and tighter editing - would have greatly improved the presentation."
5,America needs to read this book!,"In this book, Rebecca Hagelin delivers a message that America sorely needs to hear. Whether you're a parent, future parent, or just a cultural observer, you need to read this book so you know the facts and have the tools to keep your home and family safe from the invasion of filth that pervades this still great nation. 5 stars!"
1,breaks easily,Two of these bridges broke under normal playing in the first month we used them. I would not buy this product again.
2,Frustrating time-waster,"I had 3 of these Grizzly cord reels in our shop and became so fed up with them not fully retracting that I replaced them with the Rockler 12 gauge reels. I am so glad I changed them. Yes, the Rockler reels are 30' long compared to the 40' Grizzlys, but still the best for the money in my opinion. http://www.amazon.com/Shop-Basics-Retractable-Cord-Reel/dp/B001DSXDL6"
5,Self contained cord reel,"This is a built tough product of sturdy construction and hard to find 12 guage wire. High amperage rating, weather resistant with a strong mounting assembly. Good Buy! Great Price!"
4,Good Value,This is a good product that could benefit from more spring tension on the cord reel. For the price it is a steal.
2,Cheap Construction,I received the product and found it looks much better in the photos. The cord will only lock into a couple of retracted positions and does not consistently rewind completely. The spring seems weak. I imagine in time I will be taking it apart just to salvage the cord. I suppose the price was too good to be true.

5,Not as good as Promenade,"Hannon is a God thing. He seemlessly blends the foppish arms of Krishna with the comely stomach of Budda and tops it all off with Medeussa's snakey hair bits all flapping about. 'Your Daddy's Car' was recently converted into a two-second Belgian Handbag classic and used as the theme tune to the Australian remake of 'Z Cars.' A tour de force of sheer bigness, his singing mouth sounds nice in my ear. Both knee and wrist are united in their rhythmical bending by this superb album."
1,Already has a hole,My son has worn the socks only one time and one pair already has a hole. We expected better quality from UA.
4,Great socks,"I'm a big fan of these socks, but wouldn't class them as 'no-show'. They don't seem that much shorter then my other UA standard anklet socks.They are, however, very well made. My only other observation is that they are probably slightly warmer then standard sports socks. Although this might suit you in colder climates, it may not be your cup of tea.Cheers,JFE"
3,"Good looking socks but ""chunks"" of thread embedded into the sock","For those with the socks I want you to understand that they are cool looking socks, but for some reason there is thread all bunched up together almost like a ball of thread embedded into some of the socks that came into the package. I say ""embedded"" because you can't cut the thread with scissors without completely ripping the sock apart. (Had to throw the ones with this problem away, way too uncomfortable)The socks I bought only had some with this problem and I know Under Armour didn't intend for this to happen considering it is uncomfortable to walk with the socks and feel that bump of thread every step you take. Hopefully they'll notice this problem and fix it."
1,"Not really about travelling, and not really for everyone","Is this book about getting out-and-about with baby? Or, is it about all the great music her Annie is being exposed to? And all the non-toxic cloth diapers that Annie wore? And that her sweet little baby butt never touched a baby swing? Moving about with baby is just a launching pad for the author's general opinions about raising a kid in general. (And, she only has one child, so she gets to over-think EVERY aspect of parenting...)Were you the type of person who travelled the world with just your backpack and camped under the stars without a tent? It should be great fun to read how you'll be when you have kids. If you're planning a trip somewhere actually ON the beaten path, this ""guide"" is less useful."
5,Rave! Really...,"I don't know if there are a lot of books about traveling with young kids, but if there are, this has to be the most entertaining! The author's personal anecdotes, presented as ""asides"" are a complete stitch. I don't have kids, and I loved this book! What more can I say"
2,In French,Only a couple of songs in English. Rest of songs done in French. I was disappointed with the arrangement of Amazing Grace. I gave the CD to Goodwill.
2,An easygoing album with a nice vibe,"I'm a closet S.O.S. fan. While ""Kaleidoscope World"" is their best album, this one's got some nice songs for a sunday afternoon or a long drive."
2,"SOS misses big in ""Living Return""","England's Swing Out Sister face an identity crisis in ""The Living Return."" A juxtaposition of forgettable oldies and all-too-slow originals, this CD is a large dissappointment for S.O.S listeners. Aside from ""Momma didn't raise no fool,"" this CD is a brilliantly produced waste of time."
5,SOS tries a different method -- and it works!,"I'm an SOS fan and like their smooth, silky sounds, but was pleasantly surprised when I picked this one up last week and heard some new-found funk! Obviously, they wanted to branch out from their other albums and it worked. Some real, catchy, funky tunes and a great cover. Good stuff from a highly underrated group."
2,SOS moves too close to blandsville,"I LOVE SWING OUT SISTER. But this release I find very hard to like. When the lead single, a remake of a song I never cared for in its original version by The Delfonics, is only so-so, you know you're in for a difficult listen. I know there are fans who really like this album, but for me it feels like a waste of time. I'd much rather listen to the brilliant ""Shapes & Patterns"", ""Kaleidoscope World"" or the others. On their other releases, their music soars & flies. This one is earthbound."
3,"Original, but...","This collection of short stories by Lisa Moore is quite original, emotional and intense in its own right. However, for me, it also comes down to style, and I just couldn't get a handle on the writing style chosen by the author. It is very clipped, one might even say ""poetic"", but it made it difficult for me to remain interested and read on.If you don't mind this style, then you will surely enjoy these stories that have been praised by many reviewers."
5,If you like exceptional music,This artist is exceptional. We have at least 15 of Giovanni's CDs. If you love piano music this artist is for you. Try any of his CDs. I guarantee you will be pleased.
3,Great in the Beginning,"I received this book as part of a preschool homeschool package from Sonlight. At the beginning of the term, my daughter loved this book. By the end of the term she was bored with it. We took a long break in the middle of the term to move, and I think that maybe she was just too old (five) by the time we resumed our lessons. I would recommend it maybe for three and four year olds. Like another reviewer, I also found the names of the people of Banilla to be super cute, but it just wasn't enough to make it interesting for my five year old. The pages of this book were also super busy, and I know that some kids really enjoy that, but I think it might have been too busy for my daughter. I have found that to be the case with other Usborne books, as well."
5,Much more intense on BluRay,"I had the DVD of this and the DVD picture quality was not all that good. But everything jumps out at you on this BluRay. It makes this a whole new experience, like seeing this for the first time again."
3,Actually...,"I was wondering what Henry Rollins first band was: it was called SOA, but this isn't it. SOMEONE HELP ME! (btw: I put 3 because I haven't heard it (this band's) yet) BUT GOTTA GIVEM CREDIT CUZ THEY WENT TO GLASSJAW!"
5,5 stars x 2,Lucidity is Marcus Borg's middle name. One of the great contemporary Jesus scholars around. I just love the mental and spiritual stimulation that comes from reading his books.
3,Too scholarly for my taste. Not an easy read. But it's OK.,"This book was OK. I wasn't looking for a scholarly book that made me feel I was taking a course at Divinity School! But if you like that type of book, then this book is for you. I also just finished Peter Cayce's book, ""What Did Jesus Really Say -- What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information."" Personally, I thought Peter Cayce's book was better. Easy to read. Enjoyable. Interesting as well. It's up to you. Here's the Amazon link:What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information] -- by Peter Cayce"
5,Excellent study source,"I found this to be an excellent book. I've never read anything else that puts Christ's mission in such accurate context against the socioeconomic conditions of biblical times. For the first time, I could really see just why Jesus was executed, how his message was so radical and viewed as such a threat by those in power at the time. Would be an excellent study book for any Sunday School class."
5,A Magisterial Work,"For twenty five years Marcus Borg has shared his understanding of Jesus and his relevance to our world. This book is his magesterial work. Exploring the different versions of the story of Jesus doiminant among Christians today, he presents what he terms an ""emerging paradigm"" as the lens for seeing and understanding the life of Jesus as shaped by the character of God as justice and compassion.The climax of the book focuses on the message and activity of Jesus challenging the political, economic and social domination system of his day and our day."
2,Not for everyone,"I was ready to write a review to really get into this book when someone reminded me today, if you don't have anything nice to say, shut up.So I will just say; I had 30 book darts point out contradictions, assumptions and facts that had no evidence."
1,"Um, what?","I may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but this book left me flat and somewhat agitated. I couldn't wait to be finished with it. Long winded diatribes, strange presumptions, crazy metaphors, when there was a point to make it took half a chapter to do it, other wise it kind of ambled along begging for somewhere to go. I'm not trying to be unkind, but I still have no clue what this book was about. I had to select 1 star, but I really mean zero stars."
3,Wishful thinking,"'Conspiracy' is at the heart of this book, that somehow history has moved away from the real Jesus. But through his own eyewitnesses, we find that Jesus wasn't only a religious revolutionary, He was God.-ISP"
5,An eye opening experience...,"I opened this book and could not let go of it until I had finished reading. Marcus Borg has managed to write a very systematic, complete view of Jesus and his meaning for today's world. His pedagogic writing style is incredible, each chapter logically building on the foundations of the prior chapters. The view of Jesus's life, ministry and message that emerges is more cogent than any other I have I ever encountered. Marcus Borg has managed to discover the true Jesus (pre-Easter and post-Easter) and his significance for our modern world. This is a must-read."
5,"""REVOLUTIONARY ""","eye-opening modern biblical scholarship...the gospels are not 'inspired' the bible is not 'the word of god'there was no 'virgin birth' no physical resurrection, jesus is not 'god'...etc.,and he did not perform ""miracles""...""Jesus's mission and message were not about 'heaven,' not about how to attain a blessed afterlife.""...""Rather, his mission was about the character of God, the way of centering in God, and the kingdom of God...""""Jesus did not intend to start a new religion, but to do something within Judaism.""""His mission and message were not about himself or dying for the sins of the world or the creation of a new religion. These notions were all post-Easter developments.""you really must read this book to learn how & why Borg makes these kinds of claims;the fundamentalists have it all wrong...and yes, he is a Christian"
5,Many of My Opinions Are Validated Here,"The author of this non-fiction book about Jesus, His mission, and His teaching has done his homework. I found this book to be very educational regarding what we know about the specifics of what Jesus taught and how he taught it. Some of the ideas are controversial, and some are traditional. Anyone interested in this topic (and anyone that calls him/herself a Christian should be) will learn a great deal by reading this, and perhaps have their minds opened to alternative ways of seeing and thinking about the most important subject there is. It can sometimes be a bit academic and require more focus and attention than casual reading material, but is more than worth a little additional effort. This book will help you.Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, ""To Be Chosen"""
4,My review,I like the book so far. It's easy reading and has some interesting concepts. Some may be a little bit harder to buy than others. You better have an open mind and accept that this is just one man's interpretation of the scriptures and Jesus. He does give one things to think about!
5,Awesome!!!,"I'm with Roberto on this one. This book is just way, way awesome. Hope I can turn my PhD thesis into something this good!!!!"
3,"A thoughtful, well researched account.","Mutual Contempt is a thoughtful, well researched account of this tumultuous relationship and of this tumultuous time. A slight bias toward LBJ detracts only slightly from the history it retells. (I am astounded by an earlier reviewer's conclusion that the opposite slant is the case.) Mr. Shesol is to be commended for his ability to move the story along. Too often writers of histories on narrower topics tend to dwell where they ought not. One exchange which might surprise today's non-historians: RKF admonished the Johnson administration for not spending enough federal money on welfare, anti-poverty programs and food stamps. Query what either man would have thought of President Clinton's statement that the era of big government is over."
2,The book slowly succumbs to the author's preference for RFK.,"The author attempts very hard in the early part of the book to be even-handed, despite his clear preference for RFK. Ultimately, however, Shesol's own apparent contempt for Lyndon Johnson overshadows his objectivity, resulting in a book that I could not trust."
3,chronology of facts but little feeling,"This book was a disappointment. I came of age during the 1960's and 1970's, and LBJ and RFK were towering figures to me. I've spent much of the rest of my life trying to understand how the United States got into and out of Vietnam. It's also important to try to understand how much America changed in that period, and the effects those changes still have on the country today. But this book is just too pallid. It contains no real explanation for how Johnson and Kennedy felt about each other, and why. There's little discussion of their backgrounds, or characters. It just proceeds conscientiously from one event to the next, and events that should be dramatic aren't. There are a lot of interesting facts in this book, but the reader seldom gets an idea what these men were thinking or feeling. Robert Caro in The Years of Lyndon Johnson: The Passage of Power does a far better job on this subject."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I searched long and hard for the perfect oil rubbed bronze 8"" widespread faucet for my master bath remodel. I was pleased to find that the Kingston Brass Magellan was on of my favorite designs at more than half the price of big names like Moen and Kohler.The saying you get what you pay for unfortunately holds true for this product. I have had the faucet installed for just over 2 months now and the finish is already wearing off! Underneath the Oil Rubbed Bronze finish is a shiny silver which sticks out like a sore thumb. I have not used any type of abrasive cleaners to clean the faucet, only water itself which I believe it should be able to handle. Everything else looks so nice in my first total bathroom remodel that i'm really disappointed and am going to throw this one in the trash for a higher quality product.Somethings are too good to be true :("
1,Disappointed,"I agree with the previous review. This faucet was extremely difficult to install (had to buy more parts to make it work), and now, less than 6 months after installation, the finish is flaking off."
5,perfect!,"I gutted and completely renovated our master bathroom with travertine tile, and we selected oil rubbed bronze for the finish on all of the hardware. This matched the rest of the hardware perfectly, and it was easy to install since I did it prior to mounting the granite countertop onto the vanity. One of the parts loosened up & leaked a week after installing it all, which was a pain to tighten since I had to crawl under the vanity like a circus contortionist, but it was easy to take care of. I couldn't find a better price anywhere else. (and I scoured the online prices and suppliers!)This faucet works great and looks even better!!!"
3,Middle of the Road,"I liked this Yoga tape because she introduced the moves thoroughly and it's good for beginners. My only complaint is she talks WAY too much for a Yoga tape. Yoga is meant to be peaceful and relaxing and with her talking so much it's hard to do that. I usually love her chattiness when doing the walk away the pounds work outs, it's motivating and gets me through them easier. But with Yoga, you just want peacefulness to connect to your body and relax."
3,Yoga DVD,This is very entry level yoga but a great start for someone interested in learning beginning move. Moves slowly but does give a good stretch!
1,Caution: FRAGILE,"My wife and I ordered this dvd as a gift for her mother. The DVD being Leslie Sansone's ""You Can DO! Yoga."" We received the order promptly, and shipped it immediately to her mother (which we would've done originally, but didn't think of the idea until after it arrived).Anyways, when her mother received it, the dvd was broken; cracked right down the middle. There was no apparent damage to the shipping container either, which led us to believe that the dvd may have been destroyed prior to shipping.It would not have mattered so much if this dvd weren't a present for my mother-in-law's birthday, but it was, therefor we were quite upset and disappointed.As far as a review of the dvd, we can't give one at this time as we don't have a working one.I would expect at this point for the seller to replace the dvd and ship us a new one for free to make amends for this situation."
1,Should Christians do Yoga?,"If you are a a true Christian, then like me, you will stay away from this form of 'exercise'. I do not encourage anyone to get involved in any type of yoga no matter what is purported as innocent exercise.I firmly believe that many Christians should look at the roots of this 'exercise' and strongly suggest you research its foundations, open your eyes to the truth; [...]I have many of Ms Sansone's walk away the pounds and regularly do do physical exercise with them, However, my spiritual 'exercise' does not come from doing such things as this. Anyone who is a true Christian will know what I am stating in love, be wise and understand what yoga is really about.*(I had to give a one star rating, however I do not rate this dvd for anyone to partake.)"
3,hard to find edition..,"Book was shipped quickly. Not in great shape, but not bad for used. This is a hard to find reference book for anyone in recovery. I gave it to a friend in Substance Abuse counseling."
4,A very good book indeed,"Overall, this book grabbed my attention and held it throughout most of the book. I had some trouble towards the middle, but overall it was a wonderful experience. I would recommed it to others."
5,Love it!,"I love this book. The chemistry is great, the charters are funny and sweet but strong in their own ways. The story line is wonderful, the amount of things that happen in this book makes me want to reread it over and over. If you like romance novels you will love this book. I've read it at least a dozen times and it's still one of my favorits. Julie Garwood is amazing with her writing. I hope you like this book as much as I do."
3,This book was ok,"I would rate this book as o.k. but I have to admit that I read this book after A Knight in Shining Armor. This book was just like so many other typical romance novels I have read. There was nothing spectacular about this book. I absolutely loved the middle of the book where Jamie and Alec started to fall in love. The beginning and ending were very slow. On top of all of this, I just found Jamie's character extremely annoying. She just seemed too perfect and a know-it-all type. I frankly found that I was more interested in what would happen to Mary and Daniel compared to Alec and Jamie."
5,Loved It!!!!,Julie Garwood is a fascinating writer. I absolutely enjoy reading her novels. I am a true fan of Scottish Laird and that time period
2,A big disappointment,"I have read books of Judith McNaught and Jude Deveraux and loved them. I noticed a lot of readers mentioning julie Garwood and decided to give it a try. I could not believe that the book I am currently reading -The Bride- is considered such an awsome book from so many readers. Am I the only one having problem with Jamie? The girl is the embodiness of stupidity. How can a girl that looked after her family for years be so silly and jump to ridiculous conclusions where her husbant is concerned? I am in the middle of the book and I don't think I'll have the courage to finish it. Alec is ok, but Jamie is the worst heroine I've met in a book. Extremely clever in everything and exrtemely ""naive"" when it comes to understanding her husbant? Something does not fit right here..."
3,Another Hyped-Up Romance,"What I liked about this book was that it didn't lose focus from Alec & Jamie. We followed their relationship every step of the way. Alec was always likeable, while Jamie's character became annoying at times. She behaved like a child and it was hard to believe an important, tough, laird like Alec would answer some of her annoying requests, let alone fall in love with her.The sub-plot could have been deleted; it wasn't developed and I figured out the villain early on. It would have been more suspensful if there was a question about Alec's involvement in the matter, but there was not.THE BRIDE was definitely better than its sequel THE WEDDING (I read them out of order). Unless you're a huge fan of the author I'd read one or the other. Both novels are extremely similar. Even the characters have similar ways.I suggest you get this book from your local library. It's not a reread."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I am not a big fan of Julie Garwood, but I would have to say that this is her worse book. The heroine is a complete airhead. I was annoyed by her constantly bursting into tears and her total dependancy on the hero. Julie Garwood needs to write about women with more of a backbone. I'm sick of reading about these ""dumb blonde"" type of characters."
2,I finished it but that's all I can say,"After reading and loving Karen Moning's books, I was looking for something similar and started by reading reviews. This book and author got a lot of good reviews. So I picked it up. What a disappointment. The characters were very shallow and 2 dimensional. I never felt like I got to know Alec at all and everything about Jamie was way too convenient. That she learned to speak Gallic as a child...how convenient...etc. I also felt like the book borrowed a lot from the Outlander series. I finished it...but I won't read another one of Garwood's books."
2,Why does this book have 4.5 stars?,"I bought this book based on the rating and boy was I dissapointed!The dialogue was nonsensical and disjointed, the sex was ho-hum, the bridegroom was a pushover and the bride just pushy.If this is the best Garwood can do, I won't be readiny any more of her books."
3,Not That Great,"I've lately been on a historical romance reading binge and came across The Bride for my Kindle. I felt that the characters were very silly and the main heroine seemed to be quite the featherbrain.I love a good historical, but I do need the characters to feel more well drawn than in this story."
3,Very good sweet romance.,"The prologue hooked me, so I bought the book. This is my third Julie Garwood novel, the first having been ""RANSOM"". I enjoyed THE BRIDE very much. What I liked most was the heroine's loyalty to her family and husband, Beak, the way the clans fell in love with her. What I enjoyed least was the bickering dialogue between Alec & Jamie, the sub-plot was a little thin, I figured out the killer too early based on Jamie's comments, and there were some shallow, confusing scenes that should have been fleshed out a little more.The fact that Andrew got all those jewels stuck in my craw - the guy shouldn't have received anything. The scene did not have the emotion to me that the author intended. Instead it left me a little ho hum at the end.Nice relationship between Alec & Jamie, nice heroine, simplistic novel, but it was really enjoyable overall as escapist romantic fiction."
3,Good but not one of my favorites.,"I guess I made the mistake of reading The Wedding before The Bride. I thoroughly enjoyed The Wedding and in fact it was my first Julie Garwood book to read. The Bride was boring to me- it was too much like her other books. I do like the women having strong personalities. But I was ready to get through with this book so I could move on. I did finish reading it but I won't recommend it. It drug on too much at times. Oh, well!"
2,Why is this rated so high?,"I'm sure no one will read this review but still...This book read like an amateurish Daniel Steel romance. Predictable from beginning to end and not in the obvious predictable way (i.e they are going to fall in love, obviously) but in a cheesy, obvious, ""and they all lived happily ever after... and no one was sad.... and it rained gum drops and flowers forever and ever!"" kind of way. I thought the last Twilight book had that same sort of annoying type of storyline, but this book makes Stephanie Myers look like Jane Austen. Anyways, it had it's moments, mostly just some minor steamy sex ""scenes"" and while I appreciated the tiny,tiny..... tiny bit of medieval European history that was offered, the characters were all so two dimensional, uninteresting and well.... cartoony (if that makes any sense?) This book isn't worth the review but I figured I'd vent anyways."
4,Great book!!,"I must confess I wasn't expecting much after reading the The Wedding (yes, yes, I know I read them in the wrong order)...And after I (sadly) finished, I can say with certainty that I will cheerish this book forever..."
4,Julie Garwod's Lairds series,"I have enjoyed reading Garwood's series of Lairds' brides and fiances. She always puts different twists, but makes the times so interesting."
4,Liked very much,"I liked this book very much. The author did a good job of developing the characters. However, at the beginning I found myself wishing she'd hurry up as sometimes her bantering between the characters can seem to drag on. I would still recommend this book as the later parts get much better."
5,Absolutely marvelous,"I have been reading Julie Garwood for a couple of years now, and i love her stories. She makes every character so real, so real in fact that me and my friends often talk about them as if we know them... She's amazing, and i'm always inquiring about her next book.... The Bride was the bomb!"
2,The Bride Audio Book,"Had a long drive of several hours. I bought this book because I have read it hundreds of times and knew it was a safe bet. The reading of the book is decent however I did not realize that this is ABRIDGED. All the humourous parts, and all the parts that made the book enjoyable was cut out. By disc three I was so disgusted I couldn't finish it. This chopped up version is disappointing... dont waste your money."
3,Meh...,"I'm so surprised by the extremely favorable reviews of this book! It's not terrible, but it's really nothing special AT ALL. In fact, there's not 1 thing about it that is unique or sets it apart from every other mediocre romance out there. The hero is a typical alpha male who doesn't want to love a female. The heroine is a typical beautiful, somewhat spirited cream puff who quite easily falls in love with a brute. There is ofcourse someone trying to kill her and a dark past for the hero. Blah, blah blah. Seen and heard it all before, only better. This isn't a horrible novel, but I can't say you're missing anything by not reading it. It's just ok."
5,WONDERFUL FUN TO READ!!!!!,"""The Bride"" by Julie Garwood was so enjoyable you won't put it down. Jamie shows you that even women in the old days could have a lot of spunk when faced with a man full of strength and passion. Alec shows that men can be gentle along with being very, very masculine. Jamie and Alec are both intelligent, loving and sexy. You won't regret reading this book."
3,Classic Garwood! A must read!,"Garwood is in true form with a story of Scottish Lairds and English Maidens. Hysterical, page turner. Get ready to fall in love with Alec Kincaid."
1,The Bride - misleading,"I ordered this book after I looked through the sample via Kindle. The first part of the sample represented a story line about a modern day career woman - and an interview that she has with an arrogant, wealthy man (who tries to rip her clothes off!) However, when I received the Kindle book the story is about a young English woman forced into marriage with a Scottish man in the 17th century - not a modern day woman. I don't know how this happened but I contacted Amazon Kindle immediately and they withdrew this product from my Kindle. So please be warned - this story is about a young English woman in the 17th century, not a modern day career woman."
2,What's So Great About It?,"I feel like SIMON COWELL and I'm sorry, but I just don't see what was so great about this book. It was boring and the plot was very weak. Need I say more? Well, I will. I usually love this author."
5,A Classic Finally on Kindle,"The Bride is one of Garwood's best, and to have it finally available on my Kindle is great. A note to proofreaders: Step up your game! I was disappointed to find so may typographical errors and repeated lines of text. I didn't let them derail me from the story, but I did have to step back and read over some passages to make them make sense again!"
5,very funny,i don't like the fact that Jamie's sisters depend on her so much but the story itself was very touching and funny. i love it when she kept on buying indulgence for his sins. it's funny and moving.
5,alec and jamie are ordered to get married,"we should all get ordered to married a man like alec. jamie is wonderfully funny,beautifull and no pushover. their love is what wishes are made of. run dont walk to your bookstore and grab this book even if its in someone elses hand."
3,Nice easy read,"All in all it is a nice easy read, which you can take to bed, read and relax, without too much action or too much excitement. It could have been worse than this, but Julie managed to keep it almost interesting enough when you just wanted to give up reading it to the end."
5,Read it now!,"I love Julie Garwood, but this book was great even for her! I fell in love with Alec immediately and Jamie was one of my favorite heroines. Forced to pick a bride from an English family on the King's request, the laird is reluctant. Duty overcomes his reluctance and he travels to chose his wife from the Baron's daughters and get back to his beloved Scotland. He picks the youngest daughter, with her man's name and all. But he soon finds his life is far from complacent, but is instead turning his life upside down. And he, of course, learns to love it. And her. This story was incredibly romantic but still made me laugh out loud as she manages to start war after war with other clans as she tries to fit in with the household. A great story, a great writer. You definately need to pick this one up!"
4,Surprised!,"I've never read a book by this author but picked The Bride up on a whim just before a flight and I found it to be a genuinely fun read. Alec is very sexy in a macho sort of way, and Jamie is quite endearing though a bit of a scatterbrain. The romance was good. All in all, it was entertaining and made the flight pass quickly."
5,Julie's best,"Jamie, the youngest (adopted) daughter of Baron Jamison, is chosen by Scottish laird Alec Kincaid to be his wife. One of his men chooses her wimpy sister Mary for his bride, in one of the most hilarious scenes ever. Jamie copes with being attacked during their way home, with Alec's child by his previous wife, all with calm and understanding and earns not only her husband's love, but his respect as well. She and Alec are a wonderful couple, very well-matched despite all their ""obvious"" differences, and this is the best of all the Garwood books."
5,Woohooo!!! There were sparks flying off the pages!!!,"Girls...what a great book!!! The attraction between Alec and Jamie was undeniable!!! I looooved the way Alec was described..so big and and almost ..primitive....yummy!!! The story was fast moving and oh so entertaining..after this...you must read "" The Wedding""...Don't you just love Julie Garwood???!!!"
5,wonderful,"this was my first garwood book and it's definitely one of her best. at times it was so funny that I nearly fell off the chair, laughing that hard. it was also a romantic and touching story, I simply loved it."
1,How did this get such a high rating?,"I don't normally review that often but feel that I need to warn people about this book. I read around 1-2 books a week and it's rare that I can't finish a book but this has been added to the ""crap"" folder on my Kindle. The heroine is described as pretty much being this amazingly talented superwoman kind of person, your initial introduction to her makes it seem like she is brilliant at everything she does however the reality is that she is the most annoying character I've ever read. She is constantly ""fishing"" for compliments and at one stage in the book even the hero asks her to stop making him repeat himself to her, it felt like I was reading the one conversation over and over. I will never read any more of Julie Garwood's books after this introduction to her work."
3,A nice novel!,"I have read this book as a recommendation of her works in a discussion forum.The writer is using a rich language in her books creating men of honor and faith.She is one of the best writers to write great endings. Her ending has amazed me.One of the concerns that I most disliked about the book is the vivid love scenes described in the book. The scenes were not done tastefully, and I viewed them as trashy which was a big turn off for me. Also, I would like there to be more to the story."
3,I Liked it. Nice typical romance novel.,"It did not have any of my pet peeves or flaws. Then ending was interesting and good. I wasn't surprised or delighted enough to rate it higher but it was enjoyable. Story brief: The kings of Scotland and England agree that two Scottish lairds should marry two daughters of an English baron. The story is about one of these marriages, Alec and Jamie. Their relationship starts off with insults and intrigue. They do fall for each other. Someone plans to kill Jamie.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: five. Setting: primarily 1102 England and Scotland. Genre: historical romance.To date, I've read the following Julie Garwood books. All my reviews were posted 6/21/08 except for the Saving Grace review posted 1/19/07.3 stars. The Bride. Copyrt 1989.3 stars. Saving Grace. Copyrt 1993.2 stars. The Secret. Copyrt 1992.1 star. Ransom. Copyrt 1999."
2,Sorry - not a very good book,"I have tried to find some major arguments in this book, and failed. Scolnicov only describes and describes and describes; she will never help the reader with a clear passage that will tell him how all the nice passages that surround him are connected. Or are they? It seams that she is almost afraid to say something directly, and the outcome is a confused reader and a minor book. A poor contribution to womankind."
2,Stolen premises,"Branden was an associate of Ayn Rand for many years; while he can be persuasive at times, he is not a reputable writer or psychologist in the eyes of many experts in his field. He is a pop psychologist who tries to integrate psychological premises with philosophical tenets and fails mightily. Many of his psychological premises are wanting or incorrect, and his mundane writing will put you to sleep."
4,Distinguishes mature and immature romantic love in an understandable way,"I like this book because it draws clear distinctions between unhealthy romantic love and mature romantic love. In our culture, there tends to be a strong focus on romance and often what is presented in books, songs and the media is unrealistic and unattainable. This book presents a vision of mature, erotic love that embraces everyday realities and the maturing of love over time.The content in this book is not heavy and it is readable by anyone. There is a lot of good food for thought and Nathaniel Branden writes in a simple straightforward style. He is also a therapist and this book goes beyond the pop culture type books on this subject that often have very little real substance."
4,Light but informative,"This little book gives a crisp, well integrated way at looking at relationships and why we need them. Branden's relating the idea of romantic love to historical context is very important, a topic I've seen no one else discuss"
5,Cloak & Dagger,Throw back movie. This one takes me back to the 80's when you would really believe something like this could happen.
4,Very Enjoyable,"Great who- done- it family movie.Good acting, tight story, heroism and self sacrifice.Some violence (may frighten young children),but very enjoyable and a great family movie overall."
5,A childhood memory for me and a new one for my boys,This was two great movies combined in one. It was one I recall in childhood and now I can watch it with my children. It came quick and just like it said.
5,Good family film - with memories,"I had first seen this film on TV, and loved it. It was not only a good family film, but it brought back wonderful memories of San Antonio, TX, where I grew up. All of the great locations were carefully included in the story line:The Alamo, the Transit Tower (that was the name then), The Chinese Sunken Garden, and a small quick glimpse of my oldchurch, which is now close to, if not on, the Hemisfair property. The San Antonio River was also prominently shown. It was a wonderful tour down memory lane - a 53 year old one!"
4,Spy vs Spy,"Along the same lines as ""Last Action Hero"" we see a boy enthralled by the actions of a hero. Instead of a cop played by Arnold Schwarzenegger its a secret agent played by Dabney Coleman. This is a fun movie. If you liked Spy Kids you'll like this. If you didn't like Spy Kids you'll love this since it is more realistic. Good casting, scenes, and music. Great for the whole family but boys and men will enjoy it most."
5,continued from c&d by chad,"Also Reccomended : Witness-1986 (adventure/drama); The movie"" Witness"" is thou MPAA Rating : R ; for return a scene of murder,violence,some language , sexuality,and a small nude scene.Even thou the movie is rated:R and has a little boy in it, it is not for small childeren.Stars : Harrison Ford (The Fugitive), Kelly Mcgillis(top Gun), and Danny Glover (Switchback)."
1,Purchase Cloak & Dagger by itself!,"""Cloak & Dagger"" is an outstanding movie. It was typical 80's so it's a little corny, but it's a good story with no foul language or explicit scenes nor innuendos. It provides some insight into children's hearts who've lost a parent. Very heart warming and very well put together. And who couldn't love the location? San Antonio is a beautiful city and the scenery is spectacular. Good family viewing. Cloak & Dagger is a 10 Star movie.""The Wizard"" on the other hand leaves a bad taste in your mouth and should leave a bad soapy taste in the mouth of the child actors who starred in it. I purchased it as a double feature with ""Cloak & Dagger"" for my daughter. After previewing it, I was unable to let her watch it because of the foul language and sexual innuendos through out the movie. It was a cute story, which would have worked, had the producers left out the filth. This is not recommended viewing for children...or anyone for that matter. The Wizard owes me some stars."
1,Hard to follow.,"This film was about a magician posturing as a military man. He lures the antagonist into a ring of lies, deceit and espionage all the while appearing and disappearing at his liberty. This film was very confusing. The choice of traits given to the magician were very odd. He popped up at the most inopportune times. This may have worked for a comedy but there was really nothing funny about this. Why the military uniform? This was just stupid."
5,Thank The Lord!,I have loved this film for I don't know how long. Michael Murphy is top notch in the villain role and Henry Thomas and Dabney Coleman will win over your heart. A great script with top notch direction throughout.
5,Excellent!,"Watching this movie was just as enjoyable as an adult as it was when I was a kid - any my 9- and 7-year-old boys enjoyed it, too!!"
4,Got it on time as promised !!,"Ordered and got my order earlier than expected - needed for my collection of movies - ordered 2 - one for my wife and I and one for my son - his favorite as a kid an now will share with his sons , just as expected !!! Great condition - better than I thought it was going to be."
2,"One subtitled for the deaf, other not subtitled or captioned","I bought this from a bargain bin at a local store because I liked both movie. However I was put off when I checked the back, and only Wizard has SDH (English subtitle for the deaf). I bought it anyway as I wanted to replace the last few remaining VHS tapes I still have.The Wizard is subtitled as labeled on the back (English only, no other subtitle language). Cloak and Dagger does not have subtitle or closed captioning :( I really want to get rid of my old VHS collection but companies like Universal are too cheap to make it all in closed captioned or subtitled for the deaf.The lack of subtitle or closed captioning for half a DVD set and the lack of any other extra feature is why I am giving this one only 2 stars. It would have been 1 star if The Wizard wasn't subtitled."
2,Too Brief To Do Krishnamurti Justice,"This is a tiny, tiny (89 pp.) book is far too brief to dojustice even remotely to a thinker like Jaddu Krishnamurti. The sizeof the book is only 3.5"" x 5.0"" and the longest excerpt from any of his talks or writings (the book is composed solely of such snippets from his other work) are very short -- 2 pages at the most -- and they fail to give an adequate understanding of the breadth and deepness of Krishnamurti's mature philosophy, one that in my opinion, is one of the most important streams of contemporary thought, and one which surely deserves more than such a tiny volume is able to convey. It's cheap, but not worth the price. Get one of his larger and more complete books if you are interesting in finding out what this brilliant and very genuine man had to say. Any less than that would be doing injustice to the integrity of his work."
3,its okay,the smell is ok. takes some time to get use to. definitely for older women. the perfume is more of a winter smell not for summer or spring
1,No.,"If I recall correctly, I may have read the first few pages of one of Clancy's earlier ""novels"" until my gag reflex kicked in and I began to go into a massive, boredom-induced seizure.I have not read this ""book"" (and I use this term loosely, because Clancy's tomes of ennui are more torture devices than anything else) but I think it will suffice to say that it involves one or more of the following:1. Jack Ryan and his never-ending quest to involve himself in sticky situations with bearded men who wear hammers and sickles prominently on their clothing.2. Espionage.3. Russia.So if you're pretty sure that you lack either a soul or a personality, there's a fair chance you might enjoy this ""book.""P.S. JACK RYAN WINS IN THE END!!!! HAHAHAH SPOILER!!"
1,UGH! Save your money.......,"This is an extremely poor offering from an author who has written some excellent and thrillling books. No plot to speak of, slow moving, poor or no character development, and a main character (Ryan) who becomes less likeable the more I read about him. He is complaining, boring, predictable, and profane. Save your hard earned dollars on this one."
3,Note to Tom Clancy- get a better editor!,"Until recently, I read every Tom Clancy book. However,each new book got bigger and bigger and bigger, without much plotting to fill out the pages.I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying this story. Unfortunatly, it's too long and wordy, and the women are too perfect. If only this book had been about 200 pages shorter!Jack Ryan get's his first taste as a real live CIA agent. The details on the Soviets are delicious fun. A better editor and this would have been fabulous!"
3,"Decent read, but maybe a little too realistic for some","Tom Clancy has become famous for his technical aptitude, realism and plausible plotlines. This book is no exception- except it is more realistic than many Jack Ryan fans would want. You see, this book has a little to do with Ryan, some to do with Ed Foley and Mary Pat, and a whole lot about the spy trade in general, set against the backdrop of the assassination attempt on the Pope in the early '80's. I found the book to be an interesting dissertation on the suspenseful boredom that is espionage; there is little action and little heroism from Ryan (he seems to just be along for the ride, more or less). That's not the point of the story, however. It really is more an examination of the fraying of the Soviet empire and how desperate, powerful men can tilt the world toward war if not checked. Read the book, but don't expect a typical Jack Ryan thriller."
1,Introspection doesn't work for Clancy,"Clancy fans will be disapointed in this latest attempt. Known for lots of detail (propeller cavatation, flying drones) in previous novels-he has given that up in this one. Instead almost every character has repeated periods of introspection as a substitute book filler. Believe me when I say that introspection is not what Clancy is good at.The book is slow, the characters attempts at look back foresight are tedious (Gee, the new shortstop for Baltimore-Ripken- looks like he is going to be good).Oh, and by the way, I apologize for the late review but I picked this book up and put it down several times before I finally waded through it.Give this book a pass."
1,major disappointment,"As a huge Clancy fan, this is by far the worst. No suspense, forced dialogues and a feeling that Clancy needed to somehow fill 700 pages. Look at the large letters as a means to make it look ""big"".If Clancy does not come back on track with his next book, he will loose lots of - still - loyal readers."
2,Paid by the word?,I've read all of Tom Clancy's books and this one is by far the most mediocre. It almost seems that he was being paid either by the word or by the weight of the manuscript. He uses big words where they are not very appropriate as if he was using the thesaurus on his computer. The story is predictable and not that exciting. If he wanted to write a book about baseball teams he should have just done it instead of using it for filler. Altogether very disappointing book.
3,"Interesting, but not great","Glad to see Ryan wasn't president! I thought tying the story to a specific historical event was interesting, but all-in-all the plot lacked tension and drama. The ""Red Rabbit"" excursion didn't offer any ""what's going to happen next"" moments. Give Clancy credit, though, for coming up with an new story line in a series that dying out book by book. A book only about the Foleys would be a good next step, a la John Clark. Worth the read, but no ""Hunt for Red October""."
3,A Fan,"Red Rabbit was a disappointment. There was little to no suspense, Clancy was just plugging in a formula. There are only so many times one needs to be told that Jack Ryan was a marine and hates to fly. The book was worth reading through - but I would recommend waiting for the paperback version"
3,Interestingly Unintersting,"Having read all of Tom Clancy's books to date, some many times over, I finished this book with the impression that there was a whole lot missing. The plot while inviting, did little to capture the imagination and while the book is 600 pages plus it was easy to book the book down and go for coffee. Jack Ryan is back to being a starter with the CIA which would indicate that this book should have been prior to The Bear and the Dragon?Perhaps with the inclusion of those characters made popular in previous novels this book may have had more interest. As much as I like reading these novels I must say it was disappointing. This is just my opinion - perhaps others will find it better."
2,Not up to his standards,"Wow, I was looking forward to this book, and it was quite a disappointment. Poor editing results in deja vu - you'll swear you have already read sections of the book, and you will be right, just turn back a few chapters. I don't know what the ditty about mad dogs and englishmen is, but I certainly don't need the reference at the beginning _and_ end of the book. The technical details that drive ( or bog down depending on your point of view) his other books are not present in this one. He needs to stop writing for the sake of movie plots (ie young Jack ala Affleck) and return to President Jack."
1,Red Rabbit,Do not waste your time or money. Red Rabbit takes you to the duldrums. If it wasn't for Tom Clancy's past novels and the Jack Ryan character I would have applied my 100 page theory that if a book has not captured you by the first 100 pages give it up. After 600 pages I was not captured and very disappointed with the ending.It seems that Tom Clancy was looking for a pay day and if it was his first novel it surely would have been rejected. Wake up Tom and start writing again. Or did you employ a ghost to put me to sleep.
1,Please let this be a case of Ghost Writing!!!! (ZERO STARS),"I typically enjoy Clancy's work - I've avoided the Op Center stuff from the beginning because they were only using his name. A Ghost Writer either wrote this book or else Clancy phoned it in. While it starts well enough - many interesting story lines are left unfinished and then it devolves into Jack Ryan sniveling about being ""an instrument of God"". The Clancy of old would have spun a satisfying tale focused on the Rabbit and how his information was used. This looks like a cheap knock off written by a Ghost for the purpose of a screenplay to showcase Ben Affleck's lack of talent.Editors typically fight to keep Clancy under 1,200 pages. At a little over 600 pages I could have edited this down to about 325. But in good conscience I would have sent Tom back to the drawing board (or rehab). The typical Clancy work ethic is not in evidence.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!..."
2,Not his best work...,"Just read the new Tom Clancy thriller and I must say that I'm a little dissapointed. It definately is not one of his better novels. For one thing, It's very predictable. From the start you know how it's going to end, just not how they're gonna get there. Several of the observations made in the book are repeated over and over again (Note to editor: Were you asleep at the wheel or what?) and some of the little side comments can be very annoying (Hmmm... maybe I'll invest in this little company, they make good coffee. What are they called again? Starbucks....) Tom Clancy use to be the king of the technothriller; I just hope his next book is a little better..."
1,Disappointed,"For a Tom Clancy fan who buys every book as soon as it comes out this was a major disappointment. Weak, slow plot and not at all what I buy a Clancy book for. Give this one a pass."
1,"Slow, Boring, and Poorly Written","I have read all of Tom Clancy's book, all of which, up to this point, have been outstanding. Red Rabbit, however, is slow, poorly written, and boring. Not worth the read. I can only imagine the movie will be worse."
2,Clancy was trying too hard with this one,"I guess this is one way to tackle the problem with what do do with a character who's climbed all the way to the top, won two wars, and made peace in the world. I got the impression that this book was never edited. Catch phrases are overused, and sometimes multiple characters describe an event or person in nearly identical language. It seemed as if some sections were included with the contingency that another, similar one, would be removed. They just forgot to do the removing."
1,Very Disappointed Clancy Fan,"I have read and enjoyed almost every TC novel that he has created, and can honestly say that this is the most disappointed I have ever been. The plot was predictable and without incident. The culmination was not intriguing. It took me two attempts to actually read the book. The first time through, I couldn't even make it through the first hundred pages, the story was very boring.On a positive side, if you are new to clancy try reading without remorse or the cardinal of the kremlin. don't waste your money on this book though."
1,Red Rabbit,This book could have been written in 50 pages. It is the worst Tom Clancy book I have read!
1,Clancy's worst book ever,"I normally can't put a Clancy book down until I've read it. With this book I had to force myself to pick it up.So boring no plot to speak of, no hitches in the plot (what plot ?) A guy wants to get out of Russia - the CIA/British get him out - so what - no problem,Get across the border - no problem ,the defectors wife didn't know until the eleventh hour,no problem .where was the story?, the intrigue , the plot ?I got sick to my teeth of reading about Ryans problem with flying - big deal it really added to the tension/storyline !!(I think not)For a top flight writer I thought this book was as limp as a lettuce left out in the frost.No energy,no atmosphere.Just an excuse to churn out this years book for Christmas. My brother in law asked for it for Christmas I told him to go and watch the paint dry on his newly painted door - its more interestingCan do a lot ,lot better"
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"This book inspired me to write a book review for the first time to try and warn others to stay away from this book. If you're a Tom Clancy fan, don't buy this book! If you must read it, save your money and get a copy from the library. This book is boring, repetitive, poorly written, and filled with Clancy's politics. Time to retire the Jack Ryan character, Tom, and you might want to think about retiring yourself."
1,geographical errors,"The KGB major and his family are escaping to the west with CIA help. The plan is for them to take a train from Moscow to Budapest and then to be smuggled to Yugoslavia. However the train route in the book is as follows: Moscow-Beograd-Budapest.There is even a short passage on the train in Beograd, the Capital of Yugoslavia. Why bother then to go from Yugoslavia to Hungary to be smuggled back. They could just have disembark in Beograd and avoid all that smuggling across the border.Secondly, no train takes that route, not even a communist one.Beograd is much to the south from Budapest, about a day trip.Seems somebody did not look up the map when writing this poorly constructed plot."
1,Red Rabbit - audio version,"I love to listen to audio recordings of thrillers while I exercise - but this production was a terrible disappointment. The performance is monotonous and the character portrayal lacks distinct colors, tones and nuances. I look forward to reading the book - but would dissuade anyone from purchasing the audio version."
2,What Happened to the Real Jack Ryan?,"I've enjoyed all of Clancy's books and have read several more than once (Red October, Patriot Games, Clear & Present Danger.) This edition of Jack Ryan left me cold in a number of ways. I'd like to know who the whingy, whiny jerk is who professes to be Jack Ryan. It seems all he can do is bellyache about everyone's terrible (Except Cathy's) coffee and bland food. I almost put the book down for good near the end after reading the repetitive complaints about Taster's Choice coffee. Also, we know he doesn't like to fly, but for God's sake, do we have to hear about it endlessly? The Brits offered him a copter ride from Heathrow to Mildenhall and he had the audacity to refuse. He doesn't do choppers after his accident. What a sissy!I have a copy I'll donate to someone with the patience to read this one and the cost of the hardbound is a gift, Mr. Clancy. Put another of these on the bookstand, & you'll lose my respect and my $$."
2,Boring -This Is For Insomniacs Only.,"One expects a lot more ""oomph!"" from a Tom Clancy book, like stolen submarines, Irish terrorists, planes crashing into The Capitol Building -- stuff like that. Clancy's plots usually keep me up until the wee hours, but this one put me to sleep. I enjoyed doing legal research during my professional career more than I did reading this book. The plot was dull, the characters were insipid, the suspense wasn't. Everyone has a bad day now and then, and I hope that Clancy gets back into form with the next one. There really isn't much more to say about this book except that if it is made into a movie, see something else."
1,"Too many, too little","I'm not going to need nearly 1,000 words for my review. Tom Clancy has been more and more boring of late. Too many words and too little action pretty well sum things up.........."
2,Where did Tom Clancy go?,"I am amazed at what a step down this novel is from Clancy's other works. Too long for this plot, too unimaginative. Compared to his other works, this is like a snail on valium."
1,MORE DRIVEL,"When Clancy decides to shorten the length of his books to about 400 pages, I may read it. He is in dire need of an editor that will trim or even better, eliminate repetition. He can't even get his own characters' names right. Is it Price? Is it Prince? Who cares?"
1,Red Rabbit,I would rather rate it a zero but that choice is not provided. Not much of a story - and what little story there was was spoiled by injection of the neocon/far-right politics. I do not expect to read another Tom Clancy since there are lots of quality books/authors out there that leave the the politics at home.
3,profanity,I personally liked it but clancy is really getting carried away with the profanity. It suddenly showed up in Bear and the Dragon and it disturbs me. Its as if he cant find a more colorful word to describe the situation.
2,Anxiously awaited reading---mildly disappointed,"I have always given Mr.Clancy 4 stars minimum...except now.After reading most of the other reviews, a common theme emerges....a lot of words written with little effect....this was probably the only book he has written where I could put it down without continually thinking about the ""what comes next"". Granted, the Bear and the Dragon was a little long on text, but at least it moved. I hope that Mr.Clancy was just a little ""tired""--I would hate for him to drift towards this standard. Look forward to the next one!"
2,Red Rabbit,"Clancy is quickly slipping off my list of must read authors. Most of his books start out slowly and eventually pick up the pace. This book never picked up the pace. Character dialouge was painfully stilted. Finally, both Clancy and his editor need to do better research. The assassination attempt of John Paul occurred in 1981. On at least two occasions in the book the intelligence sharing between the US and Great Britian that occurred during the Falklands War was mentioned: small problem, that conflict occured in 1982!"
2,Major disappointment,"I have been a fan of Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan since I first read Red October. I am not convinced that Clancy really wrote this book by himself. There is no real suspense, the vulgarity is surprising (and disappointing the way it is used), and the book just plods along.IF this is really Clancy's work, he should be ashamed. He owes Jack Ryan, his wife, and the people of CIA an apology for treating them in such a shoddy manner."
2,This Rabbit Don't Run,"Not worth reading, let alone purchasing.As a big Tom Clancy fan, I was more than disappointed by this very SLOW moving travelogue. There was none of the typical Clancy mystery or excitement but there was 600 pages of descriptions about1) why communists are bad people (they don't like god)2) why America is great (women can shop anytime they want)3) why England isn't so bad (their beer is better than ours)4) why the CIA can't be expected to stop bad things from happening (they have limited resources)It really seemed that Clancy wanted to vent about how great our country is after 9 11 and give a little support to the Vatican after all the scandals. (Both understandable) But what is not understandable is how completely lacking in plot this book is.As a diehard Clancy fan, I am so disapointed with this book and so glad its over."
1,Worse With Each Page Turned,"Half-a-star, but that option doesn't exist.For anyone who is a fan of the character Jack Ryan, and to a degree Clancy's writing, this book will be an incredible let down. Story is slow and uninteresting, and it doesn't get better. Writing is bad, and unlike Clancy's previous novels. It's as if he didn't write the book. Language is more vulgar and not even necessary for the dialog between characters.And the references to ""Starbucks"" feels out of place chronologically. During the setting of the story, Starbucks would have existed of just a few stores in the Northwest. Hard to swallow that Jack Ryan would've have been that addicted to their coffee for so many mentions.I'll just stick to re-reading Clancy's past greats. Either Red Rabbit was ghost written, or he's lost his gift to pen a worthwhile read."
1,DID CLANCY REALLY WRITE THIS?,"AFTER STRUGLING WITH BOREDOM FOR 200 PAGES, I FINALLY TOSSED THIS BOOK. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY"
1,Disappointing at best,"Unfortunately, this is quite boring and disappointing to me. I expected a lot better from Clancy, but I suppose that now that he's ""made it"", he can turn out boring books and feel confident that people will purchase them anyway.I for one will not read Clancy anymore, there are a lot better writers of this type of technothriller out there. He's lost his touch.Save your money - don't waste your time on this one."
2,Rabbit Falls Down Its Hole,"I struggled to stay with this book, knowing it followed Clancy's same old formula. Ryan comes across as half golden boy and half wimp. Clancy should retire with his millions and leave this alone! And Starbucks in 1980? Please tell me where in Maryland Ryan had Starbucks. Clancy mentions it too often. Several points are repeated ad nauseum in fact, making this a flat, predictable, skim read at best."
2,Not his best effort,"Tom Clancy must have either tried to take us back to the cold war and resurrect Jack Ryan's character to his pre-executive position days, or he dusted off a book he began a long time ago and sent it in without completing his effort. I was very disappointed, and felt as though I had a bad copy that was missing the final chapter. While some portions of this book was entertaining, I could not figure out if I was reading a romance or spy novel.Clancy tries to make a story around the 1981 Pope assassination attempt. Clancy normally researches his efforts and while I realize this is fiction, there are some huge mistakes. The biggest being the timing of the attempt. Ryan tries to get tid bits of information and scores on the Orioles-Phillies World Series. This series took place in October of 1983, the assassination attempt was May of 1981. While this may seem petty, it is indicative of the poor effort throughout."
2,Not Clancy's best effort,"The book was not the worst I've read, but as a fan of Tom Clancy, I was vastly disappointed. What dissapointed me the most was the way he ended the book. It seems as if Clancy was 3/4 of the way into the story when his publisher suddenly called and told him he had 24 hours to finish and submit. I've never read such a hurried up, disappointing ending in any book, let alone a Tom Clancy book.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are a die-hard Tom Clancy fan, as I *was*, and just have to read every one of his books."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This is the first Clancy novel I haven't liked. It's as well written (style-wise) as anything else he's done, it's just that nothing really happens. No suspense, no huge dramatic moments (compare this to anything else he's written). I'm a little surprised he'd write a dud like this, even more surprised the publisher would allow it. If you're not familiar with Tom Clancy, this is not a good book to start with, if you are, this will dissapoint you. If you need a Clancy fix, re-read Executive Orders, or The Bear and the Dragon. Red Rabbit is roadkill."
1,HUGE FAN...WORST CLANCY BOOK EVER,This was ther first Clancy book (written by him) that I can honestly say [was bad]. Usually I end up taking a whole day to finish a book because I become engrossed. This book was laborious and at times I was tempted not to finish it at all. The pseudo-revisionist history should be left to authors like WEB Griffin as Clancy has proven that he can not take a historical precedent and weave them into his tail. The characters were never fully developed yet the ending was pretty much assured from the first time you heard about the pope. DISAPPOINTING with a capital D.
1,Red Rabbit,"After reading Red Rabbit I thought about Tom Clancy's first book and why for the past 17 years I have purchased and read his stories. Red Rabbit does not live up to any of the reasons I began reading Clancy novels. The story is long and takes forever to get going and when you finally think something interesting is going to happen it doesn't. His dates are incorrect. (He has the Falklands War happening before the Pope being shot, just one of the many) He reviews old Soviet & Russian history over and over again. Enough! No one cares anymore about the Soviet Union. It's DEAD! Move on, the Russians have Thank God!"
2,Should be subtitled: A Salute to Ronald Reagan.,"Never before has Clancy's ideological bent been so apparent. That said, it's still a pretty good story...hence the extra star."
2,How many pages does it take to share your thoughts?,"I really liked Tom Clancey's early books. They were full of action, and his scene changes were very effective in setting a tense atmosphere for his thrillers. Now, those same scene changes just take you to another character who has a paragraph of limited action and 4-6 pages of inner thoughts. If I didn't understand Communism or the Cold War, part of the book may have been interesting, but I do understand both. He spends too many pages on inner thoughts and very little effort on the story.His last book, I just gave up on, and put down after 200 pages. This one, I finally just skimmed the 4-6 pages of inner thoughts and moved to the next section. In that way, I found the book better. I don't know, however, if I will ever buy another Clancey book."
4,The fun part is figuring out fact from fiction,"This book is a very good fictionalized account of the events leading up to the fall of the Soviet Union. You know that some parts actually happened (albeit not with Jack Ryan of course) and some parts are fiction to fill in the gaps, but which is which? The ending (which I won't give away) would explain an awful lot if it's true.Treat the book as a fun history lesson and you won't be dissapointed."
1,boring,"I expected more from Clancy. I had to really struggle to get through this one, and I really like his other books!"
2,Try again...,"If you love spy thrillers, then this may be interesting for you. Otherwise, you will be disappointed. Once you get to the meat of the story, the rest is totally predictable. Good guys learn what the bad guys are plotting and spoil their plans. All of this just wrapped in cloak and dagger plotlines."
4,Red Rabbit Review,"I read nearly all the Tom Clancy novels back in the day, somehow I missed this one.It is a little dated at this point, but nevertheless has been an enjoyable read."
1,Worst of the Clancy Novels,"I have read all of Clancy's novels and this is without question the worst. Although not terribly suspenseful, it might have been alright if it had been presented as a short story. Instead it is filled with so much fluff that I found it difficult not to skip through it. At times you feel like Clancy took a European vacation while writing the book and chose to share it with us in fictional form. You're sure to grow tired of Jack's failed attempts to discourage people from calling him 'Sir Jack' or the pretentious pondering that fills these pages. Give this one a pass."
2,His old books were better,I loved Tom Clancy's earlier books but he's either tired of writing or has too much going on to focus on it(or he has someone else doing it like some of his paperback series). I've re-read some of his earlier books several times. Red Storm Rising was my favorite. But Red Rabbit is not up to par with those. Too much biased opinion and a bit slow to develop. There are better books out there today.
1,BLECK!,"I have read every book Clancy's written (not those ghost written Op's Stuff)-this is not worth the paper it is written on. Seems like he was showing off his knowledge of the 80's - not impressive that he remembers an Apple 2+ cost $3,000 originally and spent a lot of time talking about those new ""VCR's"". Zero action...zero intrigue. Not even anything to keep your interest. I threw it across the room when done-I felt better."
1,Typical Clan$ey,"A 100 page, marginal, novel 'compressed' into over 600 pages, apparently to ju$tify the $8.00 price. Perhaps worth 99cents - or the value of a sleeping pill. Long, long LONG, needless descriptions of ...... nothing. Repetitious. Boring. Slow moving. He wants to convey to the reader (the few suckers there might be of us) that he knows about the ..... one time pad! And it's not a Maxi-pad. This is a 600+ page book that you will get mad about reading about page 200, but since you've invested all of that reading time, you'll keep hoping for somethng to pique your interest. You might get it in the last 50 pages or so. Maybe.I wasted my money. More importantly, I wasted my time."
1,Oh Dear!!,"Oh, Tom!I have read all of your Ryan books and have enormous admiration for the way you weave multiple threads and characters into a coherent, highly readable and immensely enjoyable whole.I could not understand it when you teamed up with another ""co-writer"" and produced, in my estimation, very inferior stories: after all, I'm sure you no longer needed the money.Still - I thought - Red Rabbit, written solo, will return to your best storytelling...........WRONG!Red Rabbit is pedestrian, almost completely lacking in believable multiple plot-lines and with so little real interest that for the first time I had to force myself to read something that you have written. Where you have excelled in the past in bringing together many differing events to a satisfying conclusion, I'm afraid to say that this is at the same level as so many other, second rate, efforts.Do try again!"
1,WOW...What a dud,"Having been a Clancy fan for years...and wading through 250 page introductions before, I was hopeful that Red Rabbit would grab my interest...at some point in time.This book is not worth the purchase, even in paper back. True fans of Clancy will be disappointed and should save their time. A book on the Foley's adventure's in Iran might pique some interest...or another John Clark adventure. However, it has become apparent that Jack Ryan has run his course and trying to insert him into a real-life event has turned into a massive dud.And what year is this supposed to be any way? Ripken was a rookie and the Orioles played the Phillies in 1983...but the assasination attempt of the Pope was in '81 and Starbucks went public in '92. This was just terrible."
2,Some reading hints for this disappointing book,"I was disappointed by this long Clancy book. I did notice his writing begin to slip with Rainbow Six, but at this point, I think he's done for. Still, I'll probably keep reading his books like many others. Here are two hints to save time when you read this book.1. This is a great opportunity to try your speed reading. I promise you that no passage in this book needs to be read carefully.2. As soon as you see Cathy Ryan in the book, skip the section altogether (these sections have no relevance whatsoever and repeat things we all know from prior books). Depending upon how quickly you read, this could save you an hour or so.Hopefully, Tom Clancy's next book reverses this trend."
1,Painfully boring....,"I won't be redundant and restate what my fellow reviewers have so eloquently stated about the snooze factor inherent in this book. However, I will give kudos to Mr. Clancy for taking care of my occasional insomnia. Ten pages of Red Rabbit puts me to sleep faster than any pill ever could. Thanks Tom!!!Don't waste your money. There are many authors that have become much more capable than Clancy. I just read Wings Of Fire by Dale Brown and could not put the book down...fantastic!!"
1,Bland and inaccurate,"The least Mr. Clancy could do, if he is going to go back in time and do a book like this is get the historical & cultural details right. It's not like he hasn't made enough money at this point in his career to afford to pay someone to do the research for him. Furthermore in the audio version I find use of accents to be distracting. Stop trying to 'act' and read the book please."
2,Not a nonstop read,"Of the Jack Ryan series this one can be skipped. If I read or hear ""Rabbit"" now it causes me to cringe"
3,Not Great...but not bad at all,"I like so many others waited for this one to come out. Pre-ordered just to make sure.On the one hand I was happy to be reading another Ryan novel. The story moved along quite well and kept my interest.On the other hand it was short. Yes I know 600pgs pages is enough to choke an Elephant, yet I am used to 1000 plus pages. Usually Clancy needs at least 500 pages to ramp the story up and set the stage for some action. Here there is little if no action at all. The stoy has no surprises at all you know from the start all will go well. I had hoped for a bit more action in Moscow with Ed and MP. I realize that this review is not painting a nice picture. If you are a Clancy fan you need to read this,you might find as I have that it does not measure up to some of the previous masterpieces but worth the couple of days it would take to read"
3,Sympathetic characters but peters out at the end,I guess people don't buy Clancy novels for well drawn characters but that is this novel's virtue. I think most readers will be intrigued and sympathetic toward Jack Ryan and the Russian defector.The story just runs out of gas at the end. Perhaps it is because the reader knows how it is going to end. Perhaps it is because a new set of characters who are not as well drawn as the previous characters have to be introduced at the end.
2,Still a disappointment,"Right after I knew Clancy ""produced"" another Jack Ryan book. I really hoped it would be somehthing different from the disastrous The Bear and The Dragon. However, he failed me again. Tom Clancy seems to lose his edge forever."
1,"Welcome to the ""I used to love Clancy Club""","Clancy already signaled to us that he's lost interest in us with his n number of 'written with' novels where he was simply lending his name. Then he delivered novels that were 89% self-indulgent political rant. Well, this one is the last straw.He doesn't tell us why the Pope resigning would be a big deal for the West and there's so much junk between the tiny little steps that move the plot forward that after a while, I didn't care anymore. I'm so ""over"" Clancy I don't even bother to feel betrayed."
2,red rabbit not too swift,"what a disappointment! seems TC is in a downward spiral, going from futuristic westerns (rainbow 6) to lackluster manuals on how NOT to write a spy novel. red rabbit has all the buildup of TC's novels of yesteryear, but unlike his older books does not materialize into an exciting climax. goes out with a whimper ...and frankly, the writing style drove me bananas! how many times can he mention that ryan is a wuss, but his MARINE training makes him a man? and how many times can his wife (supposedly and intelligent woman) keep asking him about his work only to get the same answer - ""honey, i can't tell you""? how many times can TC emphasize just how much ryan hates flying? christ, the book is full of clichés and redundancies, the characters and flat and boring, the plot is unsurprising and dull.seems to me TC ran out of ideas but was pressured to produce yet another book ..."
1,SSSSlllloooowwww,"I've always been a huge Clancy fan. He's lost me after this one. It was a chore to plow my way completely through this book. Several times I considered throwing in the towel because it was just too laborious. The worst part....you keep hoping for some serious action, but when you finally get to the end it's not even a surprise. Don't waste your money on this one unless you want to substitute it for your sleeping pill prescription."
4,The journey is _more_ than half the fun,"I keep thinking that Mr. Clancy has finally exhausted the possibilities in this universe, and then he goes back and pulls this ""rabbit"" out of his hat. A very tightly written book, that fleshes out the Foley characters (whose most prominent previous appearance was in ""Cardinal of the Kremlin""), and offers a very plausible chain of events leading up to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II. While one could argue that there was limited suspense at times, I beg to differ. Since all the main characters make appearances later in the timeline of this universe there is little supsense as to who lives and dies or how a given event turns out. That's kind of a gimme. The real intrigue in this book is how Mr. Clancy creates a plausible chain of events to put all the pieces in place prior to critical plot points. The ends are pretty much predetermined; it's the trip that makes this book worth the read."
1,Hate to say it.....,"....but I agree with the folks who gave it only 1 or 2 stars. I've always absorbed his books in a limited number of seatings (to my wife's dismay -- she never sees me until I'm done). With this one, I read the first quarter of it....put it down....and never picked it up again."
2,Red Rabbit,This book is slow to start and generally verbose. It is very straight ahead with nothing from left field to give the plot a few twists.
1,What's happened to Tom Clancy?,"I read Hunt for Red October in two days...but it took me nearly two MONTHS to drag myself through Red Rabbit. It takes hundreds of pages to lead up to an outcome that is obvious from page 50. Because everything has to play out a certain way to match historical fact, there's no suspense whatsoever. And Clancy has turned Jack Ryan and his wife into flawless superpeople who are already the best in the world at what they do (spy/analyst and surgeon, respectively) in their early 30s.I'd thought ""The Bear and The Dragon"" was bad, but it's a masterpiece compared to ""Red Rabbit""."
1,Are you sure this isn't Clancy's first book??,"I think Clancy has ran out of books to write and he's just fulfilling his contract with his publisher for another book and so many words each year. The writing is so clumsy and boring it would fail any freshman English course. There is no action, nothing really interesting happens and once interesting characters have had a lobotomy. Clancy and his publisher should be ashamed of this one!!"
2,Purely Disappointing,"The book rehashes political thoughts and emotions from a decade which is two decades in the past. I thought Rainbow Six was a great step forward in both character and theme development. Certainly believed Clancy would have great material in the new techno-terrorist landscape, I guess not. If Rainbow Six is three steps forward, Red Rabbit is five steps back."
1,Boooring!,"636 pages jam packed from beginning to end with pure drivel. A must read for insomniacs. Zero action, but lots of descriptions of every meal for Jack Ryan. This book may have been a cruel joke by Clancy to see if he could write a thick book with absolutely no action and have past fans read it to the end to see if something - anything - happens. Well, he sucked me in. Don't make the same mistake."
2,Not Clancy's Best Work,"I really like Tom Clancy, but this should have never been published. All but about 5% is just long, drawn-out boring stuff. It's good to get inside the characters heads to understand who they are and how they think, but this book pushed it past the point of diminishing returns."
2,Self-Indulgent,"Although I did like the book's plot, Clancy should have taken out at least 150-200 pages of fluff. When compared to an earlier book such as The Hunt For Red October, its flaws really stand out. It meandered endlessly, had a great deal of redundancy, was condescending, and just plain boring. It's an extremely disappointing book. The Red October in comparison was a tightly-written book. My impression of Red Rabbit is that it was just a way to rake in a few dollars by its placement in the series. Clancy seems to have indulged himself instead of taking the extra time needed to make this a cleaner, quality book."
1,Waste of Paper,"As many other Clancy fans said before, I should have read others reviews first. However, being a loyal fan of past books, I unknowingly bought it and wasted a long weekend on it. For a 600 page book, the plot was thin and predictable. Unfortunately, some one in Hollywood will try to make a movie out of it and bore us all over again.Clancy fans, DO NOT BY THIS BOOK! It will tarnish anything that he writes in the future.PS - There should be a ""No Star"" Choice for this book"
1,Shame on you Tom,"What a disappointment. I was left wondering who wrote this book for Tom. Since his last book, Tom has discovered the ""F"" word and use of it (a lot) adds absolutely nothing to the story. Tom Clancy on the cover used to be reason enough to put money on the counter. I shall wait for the reviews on his next one.Move forward Tom. Have a new person be a player with President Ryan. Then let the man leave office, retire and go away. Please, no more looking back."
2,Yawn,I am a huge Tom Clancy fan. I've read all of his fiction stuff and have loved all of them. That's why Red Rabbit was such a disappointment. I didn't think it possible for Clancy to write a spy thriller with ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION. It was a little bit interesting to read his research/speculation about how things worked in the KGB and CIA but the story went nowhere. Compounding that was the fact that we all know how the Pope assassination went. I hope he can write a more exciting story next time.
1,Red Rabbit,"I guess Tom has finally run out of ideas. ""Red Rabbit"" should have been named ""Dead Rabbit"" as it is the most boring book I've read in the last 10 years. As I read along thinking that any minute something really good was going to happen, as in most of the other books that he has written but NO nothing was there. I was surprised and couldn't believe that Tom was doing this to me and the great Jack Ryan. I dozed off several times and finally speed read the rest of the book. I am very unhappy that Tom has pulled this fraud on me and the rest of his loyal readers. Shame on you Tom!"
1,Red Rabbit - More Dog Than Rabbit,"I've purchased all of Clancy's fiction and usually love them. ""Red Rabbit"" is an absolute dog. I got about 1/3 of the way through it and just couldn't punish myself anymore. This is as non-Clancy a book as is possible. The pace is agonizingly slow and the book (as far as I could stand reading) is all character development. For an author that's known for techno-thrillers, there's no ""techno"" and no ""thriller"" in Red Rabbit."
1,Red Rabbit,"This book drones on and on and doesn't seem to make any point. After 200+ pages, I quit reading and put it away. Tom Clancy, you can do much better than this drivel."
2,Zzzzzzzzzz,"I just finished Red Rabbit.I must say I was rather disappointed. A very dull and ordinary re-telling of a historical event.Here is the whole story:Someone reads a letter from the Pope to Moscow, KGB guy feels badabout plans to kill the Pope. KGB man tells CIA guy. CIA guy tells his boss, boss sends Ryan to help KGB guy and family defect, Ryan arrests one of the assassins, Pope gets injured, everyone lives happily ever after (except assassins). Easily a 100 page story......not 618!Very dull reading, absolutely no drama, suspense or suprises.I have read, and own all of Clancy's books Fiction and non fiction. What happened with this one?"
3,Technical Problems,"If you like Clancy as I do, you will like this book. But, it is not Clancy at his best. It is essentially a ""Jack Ryan and friends"" novel overlaid onto actual historical events. At times it seemed rather contrived. There are some technical glitches that were distracting, e.g., Page 1 describes the PX as selling groceries when in fact it is the Commissary that does that. Clancy I believe should have known better. Elsewhere, Clancy stretches credulity when he has Ryan picking up Starbucks coffee stock in 1981 when in fact Starbucks wasn't a publicly traded company until a few years later. I am familiar with the history of the period and the whole book seemed to me like it was constantly trying to fit Jack Ryan into the events of 1980-1981 but that may be one of the hazards of overlaying fiction onto historical fact."
1,Who edited this thing?,"I'm not done with this book yet; it isn't terrible, but I am highly annoyed by the inconsistancies. Granted the book is a work of fiction; but it is a work of fiction centered around actual events and several actual people. So if the book is centered around the assasination attempt on the pope that occured in May of 1981, why is it that:1. Early in the book, 'Red Rabbit' describes being at his job for 9 1/2 years; right out of college in 1973 (which would make the book fall of 1982)2. At one point, Greer refers to ""that rookie shortstop for the Orioles...Ripken?""; who made his major league debut in August of 813. Ryan also refers to transferring his sporting enthusiasm to baseball after he 'lost the Colts'; which happened in early 1984.The story isn't terrible thus far; I don't need gobs and gobs of action; but if you are going to tie into real-life events, at least be consistant."
1,BEYOND AWFUL!,"I have just driven from Chicago to Atlanta, listening to Red Rabbit on CD. Despite the fact that it was instantly clear that this was a simply dreadful book...In an insane fit of sadism I finished the whole thing. I had read the first five Clancy novels when they were published, and in a fit of nostalgia I purchased this CD for my trip. My brother wanted to throw the disks out the window, but I kept them. I think I will give them to him as a gag gift this Christmas! The thought of having read an UNabridged version makes me tremble. I see no need to elaborate and justify my comments, as there are 445 other reviews here, If you scroll through them you will find 9/10 reviews hostile. It is time to put Clancy back in the Crypt..."
2,"The Hunt For. . . Something, Anything Else","Tom Clancy isn't the most gifted writer, but he's always been one of the most entertaining. New wars, new gadgets, new bad guys. You know the good guys will win, so the fun lies in seeing how all the new military hardware (plus true American grit) would make it all possible.Clancy's new book, Red Rabbit, tries to break with Clancy's successful formula -- and it's a real stinker.The book is set in the early '80s, so we don't get to see any cool new toys. And anyone born before 1975 can tell you the Pope is going to survive the assassination attempt.So what does that leave us? It leaves us with Clancy attempting to re-create The Day of the Jackal.Well, I read that book already, and it's much better than Red Rabbit.If you're a big Jack Ryan fan, this might be a cute book for you. But 600 pages is still an awful lot to slog through, just to find out more what Jack was like back when he only had two kids.Don't bother."
1,Never buy Clancy again,"Worse than his last book. He is either using a computer to write the dialogue or he has lost it. Does not even sound like english as we speak it. Embarassing. No plot, no action. No comparison to his earlier books. If the name was not Clancy, no publisher would have touched this. Maybe the worst novel I have ever read.Clancy and/or the publisher should give all buyers a refund."
2,Clancy's Formula Getting Stale?,"Having read all of Clancy's previous Jack Ryan books, I was very disappointed in his latest effort. It stuck me that Clancy's formula is getting stale, he is getting lazy, or he finished writing this book in a hurry in order to meet a publishing deadline. The first 500 pages of this 600 page book resemble a typical Clancy effort with multiple plot lines and heavy detail. However, at about the 500 page mark it is as if Clancy decided he had to wrap this book up in a hurry. Anticipation and suspense disappear, and plot developments become predictable because of the known history about the attempt on Pope John Paul II's life. As a result, the story falls flat. Like many other authors that have sought to wring every possible story out of characters that have captured readers imaginations, Clancy's imagination seems to have reached the bottom of the barrel with Jack Ryan in Red Rabbit."
2,embarassing,i hope this is the effort that finally catches up with clancy and exposes his limitations -- i hope it comes out that his last wife turns out to be the real author (ex. fick francis) this effort was an insult---there is no other way to describe it i give credit to his storytelling talents but there were maybe 200 pagesof quality in this effort this is just another example of the rich getting richer and an author not even willing to take a gamble -------lets put jack ryan as head of merrill lynch in this market and see what a hero is
2,Jack Ryan getting tired,The Ryan saga goes back in time. Clancy as usual gets long winded and seems to gt tired of the story by delivering a sub par ending. Overall a bit disappointing.
3,Not as bad as some reviewers say,"Obviously, given the story line, the overall outcome of the book is predictable. Nevertheless, I found myself interested and unable to put the book down as I read how the main characters (Foley, Ryan, etc.) tried to pull off the operation in the book.This book, like The Bear and the Dragon, is not what can be called action-packed. Nevertheless, it is still a rather good read."
1,An utter waste of time,"I can only add, to what has already been written, the following: it was my immediate impression that this achingly slow and pained story had rested on Tom Clancy's office shelf for nearly 20 years and was brought out merely to fulfill an obligation to the publisher. the story is so lacking in suspense and so full of never resolved plot defects that it is truly hard to believe that this tome was written by the same hand that crafted stories the likes of ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"" et al. Frankly, I was hoping and praying that some of the idiotic plot twists would SOMEHOW get resolved or explained but that was not to be. too bad, I hope I am able to stomach another run at his latest work."
4,Mental Intrigue Replaces Physical Action,"It seems many of the reviewers who wanted more action failed to see that this tended to be more of a phsycological thriller with classic Clancy sprinkled throughout.What goes on in the mind of a defector? What goes on in the mind of the agent? My favorite part of this book is the contact between Rabbit and Foley. The mental anguish, intrigue and excitement replaces the gun-toting chase scenes.I also liked Clancy's use of real events from the past to interwine with his story. It doesn't replace ""Without Remorse"" as my favorite Clancy novel but it did keep me involved to the end."
2,Disappointed,"I like Clancy a lot. But this book is a misfire and a mess. It's even badly (or barely) edited -- typos, historical mistakes, repeated sentences in different chapters, on the whole about 200 pages too long. I'm sure it was hard to take Ryan back to an earlier point in his career, but if this is the result, then either take him forward or drop him. Just re-read The Hunt for Red October; at least it had suspense and plot complications."
1,Skip it.,"Others have said it already. There's no drama. Everything proceeds like clockwork and exactly as you would predict. There's never any sense of danger, no suspense. Do not buy this book! Do not BORROW this book!"
1,Not up to Clancy's usual performance,"In the first 400-500 pages of this book, Clancey pays homage to President Reagan and the Catholic Church. Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't make exciting reading.I greatly prefer any of his other novels. They have action and excitement to keep me up late reading. In contrast, Red Rabbit is slow moving and has a predictable conclusion."
1,Rewriting history is not a good idea for fiction.,"I was rather disappointed with Red Rabbit, precisely because there is a lot of that history that I lived, and seeing it reorganized as Clancy did bothers me. A reader ought to ask the following things. 1. When was President Reagan shot? 2. When and where was the Pope shot? 3. When was the Falklands campaign? 4. When did the great bull market of the 1980s begin? 5. That fall, what teams played a seven-game World Series? 6. When did Leonid Brezhnev die? 7. Did President Reagan first refer to the Soviet Union as an evil empire before that event or after that event?"
1,A novel from the cutting room floor?,"I concur with other reader's disappointment at this very ho-hum Clancy novel. My suspicion is that it was duct-taped together from unused earlier work to meet a contractual obligation, but that may just be my cynical mind at work. Like another reviewer, I'm also a Brit, and I was irritated by several minor inaccuracies in descriptions of things British. (examples: 'station wagon' = 'estate car' not 'estate wagon', the derided Taster's Choice coffee is a US brand, not a UK one) not very important, but if things you know about are wrong, what else is? Clancy/Ryan also comes over as insufferably condescending and anti-Brit, anti-Russian. This is quite a skill, given the cardboard characterizations other reviewers have noted. At best, an airplane book, if rather heavy!"
1,Great dissapointment from a former die-hard TC fan,"Tom,You owe your readers more than this. I used to celebrate the publication of your books, and remember the thrill of reading The Sum of all Fears and Rainbow Six. What a let-down. One more like this and I won't be back."
4,Pulling One out of the Hat,"Clancy is filling gaps in the Ryan saga, and Red Rabbit is a great addition. Yes, there's a deal of repetition, and you do need to have a grasp of the Ryan world, but using Mary Pat and Ed as the main protagonists is a neat turn. Typos there are---but blame the copy-editor, not Clancy. And it is set around an historical incident we all know about, so it isn't a novel of surprise revelations. But all in all worth the full hard-back price I paid. Keep at it Tom---we all have average days."
4,Second best after Red October,"After reading so many bad reviews about Rabbit, I did not even want to buy it. Lucky I was to have it offered to me.It is probably his second best after red October, with much more deep characters. For once, Ryan and family really live. And of course, we know that the Pope was not killed. But the twists and plots are superbs. The Fowleys are living persons too. It is as meeting long lost friends who tell you what happened to them over the past years!Slow pace reading, interesting, found my old friends.A must."
3,Early Clany writing is apparent,"This book takes places as a young Jack Ryan and really explains more on Jack Ryan's wife Cathy. I really liked how clancy put the suspense in this book, but certain parts of this book was a little slow at times, but the ending is great. You will be shocked at the ending of this book."
