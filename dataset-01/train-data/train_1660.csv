2,mediocre,"You know that annoying charecter? Yep, he's in here too. (2nd and 3rd episodes arn't as bad.)The english version is quite dumbed down compared to the translation.The CG sequences would have been cool in the 80s. Now they look like a student 3d animation project. The artists either have never been in a car before, or just bought ""Auto Modelesta"" for thier PS2.and it's s-l-o-w...But it's not horrible. Rent it if you can. Plus, You get to watch a really odd music video!"
5,The best Anime Street Racer EVER!!!,This is by far the best racing anime ever. If your not into cars or racing after watching this show then you will be. The high speed downhill battles will have wanting to go out and drift your local mountain pass. The english version of the DVD will land you both the English and Original Versions of the episodes. I recommend the originals. This is a must buy for anime and street racing fans. Take that Fast and Furious.
1,TOKYOPOP really should get a backbone.,"It's mangled, just like the manga (US release). In the English version on the disc, they really bent over for American Censorship (TM). K.T.? Natalie? Iggy? Who came up with these names? Also, the original creators actually sampled the authentic engine sounds for each of the different cars for the original version. But the english audio has these ""tricked out"" rice rockets in an attempt to be ""cooler' and ""more hip"" to the same people who think ""The Fast and the Furious"" is real. The background music as well was mangled, as they replaced the original tracks with - face it - horrible garage and punk bands. The major KICK-IN-THE-PANTS is that the relationship between Natsumi (errr, Natalie?) and her ""daddy"" has been deeply removed. I guess enjou kosai is too deep a subject for American audiences. My advice? Don't buy the TOKYOPOP release. Save your money for the R2's."
4,A Must Have Anime For Car Lovers,Man I am reading some of your reviews and I must say STOP BI*CHING! I mean I see people complaining about the American version of Inital D and how they changed the music SO WHAT! Toykopop also added the Japanese verison for people that like to read the fast subtitles and miss the action.The story is great about Tak not even knowing that he is a born street racer and he non-shalate (sp?) atittude makes he a very good main character. To me this is the best of Anime and street racing all in one cartoon!
5,"Find the author, find the paperback edition","Narrator Frank Ridgeway's story is that of any American adolescent, one of dreams and heroes slowly replaced by loss and friends. Eddie Wilson is the tragic visionary, the Springsteen + James Dean character that remains to this day the very heart of the American dream. In the bonds between these brothers of purpose, we find ourselves and our national heritage.Words & music still need each other. Thought & spirit govern our course through life.The author, the Wordman himself, lives & teaches. His book is available in a special paperback edition with a new post-movie afterword. Find him & you'll find this book. It's well worth the effort."
3,"Good book, better movie...","Book vs. movie is one of those debates that almost always falls in favor of the book. This is one of the few times I would go the other way. The major plot differences seemed better the way the movie portrayed them. (And believe me, it is as if there was a general ""story"" that was given two radically different tellings)The differences were quite striking, to say the least. While I appreciate that the novel delved into personalities and back-story a little more, I actually found that I liked the ""story"" of the movie better. While I did enjoy the book, I found it a disappointment by comparison and feel that there was too much unexplored area based on the fact that it was 100% written for Frank's point of view.I think all fans of the movie should read the book to experience where the original story was intended to go, because JoAnn might be the only character that seems relatively unchanged."
4,A good read,Been looking for this book for awhile. The movie took a lot ofinformation right from the book.
5,Good book,I've watched the movie several times and I love it.Wanted to see how different the book was.Still reading and it's different and sometimes the same.
2,Contrived,"In my view, the most interesting parts of the movie involve the musical interaction between Wordman and Eddie, and the growing popularity of the Band. But the book is a letdown.The author really never develops the musical collaboration between the Band's members. The reader is left to assume that the Band became popular, but how and why are never explained. I found the dialog to be contrived and pointless. The book's characters are never developed. The violence is gratuitous and pointless. If you like the movie, forget the book. This 30-year-old read is certainly not worth a full $12.99 Kindle price."
3,somewhat disappointed,Loved the movie. Think I would have enjoyed the book much more if I had it first. Would recommend it for lovers of celebrity mysteries.
4,Another good band you never heard of,"All I can do is basically echo the previous two reviews. ""Bluster"" is a good single, and this is a good ""EP"". I only gave it four stars because I save five stars for things like the Beatles' ""White Album"", but this is really good Norwegian grunge. As a previous reviewer indicated, the reason why they didn't hit it big was timing; this came out in '95, right when everyone was getting sick of grunge and wanted something different. But now that we don't have to hear grunge all the time, it's quite enjoyable."
4,Excellent,"This book provides an excellent background to the study of religion. In addition, it introduces the reader to certain key ideas of various thinkers he might not get around to reading: Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, James Frazer, Mircea Eliade, E. E. Evans-Prichard, Clifford Geertz, and E. B. Tylor. My only problem with the book is that Pals does not introduce us to the thought of a traditional Christian writer."
3,"Okay, not great.","If I didn't have to pay shipping, I would have sent these hats back. I felt they were made very cheaply and one came without the attached ribbon. The ribbon is just that...a flimsy piece of cloth you stick into the hat to help it stay on. It also had a price sticker attached of $3.99!!! Talk about being ripped off. The only reason I kept them was because my daughter really wanted one for her birthday and I was out of time to have something better shipped. The only good thing about this hat is that it is lightweight. Next time I will pay a little more and hopefully get a hat of better quality."
4,A fine deal,"The strap on this hat is a little difficult to fasten and adjust. If the hat is not snug enough on you, a good breeze will easily blow it off your head. However, once it is adjusted to your head size, it is excellent for keeping the sun off your face when doing outdoor work. It also does fairly well in the rain as well in keeping you head dry."
4,Matchpoints,Seem to fly like broadheads. Definitely flys closer than regular field tips. I would suggest replacing your regular field tips with these match points for practice.
3,8 Year Old Loves Pajama Sam,"My son loves Pajama Sam and the games have missing socks, so he wanted to try this game. He has played it, but lost interest saying it was hard."
2,"Basic Combinations, Not Impressive","When I saw the title of this DVD, I was ecstatic. I thought the DVD would include combinations that would be intermediate/advanced; I was extremely disappointed. A lot of these dancers are well known, but the combinations leave much to be desired and I expected more. I only liked aprox 4 of the combinations and each instructor did I think two combos each. Definitely not worth the price. For the advanced beginner at best."
3,Bigger than it appears,"looks good, but is actually much bigger than it seems. I bought it as a gift to my mom and she has pretty thin wrist which makes the watch even bigger."
2,Disappointed,This watch looks great in the online picture but once I received it. Ewww. It's very small and I have a small wrist to begin with. The face of it curves up from the center. I sent it back.
5,Dream with Me,"The talent of this lovely young girl is amazing, we enjoyed this concert and have already replayed. We thank God for the awesome gift of music He has bestowed, for us to enjoy!Barbara Armstrong"
5,very nice blueray,"We enjoyed this blueray. very clear picture and very clear sound, great performance. would recommend. hope she will also sing some country and pop someday so can she what she sounds like in other forms of singing."
4,Good album,"Good album. But my bluelay player can not play this bluelay disc. I'm play on play station 3.Best regards,A.Surachai"
5,An angel,Jackie always surprises us with her talent and charisma. I am very proud of her and I am glad to hearing her songs each day!
5,I love it,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? I'm a man in my 50's - raised on classic rock - but Jackie cuts through me and is able to touch me in a way that very few ever have. She honestly brings tears to my eyes. I've never been (and never will be) a fan of Barbara Striesand or Sarah Brightman but I love Jackie Evancho.As I told my brother after stumbling upon this concert on PBS - I felt that I had just found the most perfect creature the universe had ever produced. While I'm looking forward to what she'll accomplish in the future, if I had the power to, I would freeze her here and now. She'll never again be this combination of talent, beauty and innocence which I believe is what makes her so precious to so many. She's an absolute treasure."
5,Dream with me in concert,"When ordering This DVD I did't know what to expect, When DVD arrived It was Great I coudn't believe my eyes. I was left speechless her voice was wonderful, what an angel, I wont tell you anything about the DVD, because I dont want to spoil the show. Since I have recieved DVD I have watched it four times,I cannot praise this DVD enough."
5,Fantastic!,"That kind of voice is not supposed to come of such a young and so mature of a girl. Wish it came in Blu-Ray, but the DVD cost less. There is a great duet with Barbra Streisand' only Barbra is on a background video but it's done right. It's nice to see Barbra on screen without her pushing her left winged liberal agenda. I liked to see Jackie's hand movements. Buy this DVD if you know what's good for you."
5,Once in a life time,Only once in a life time does a child come along that can put the world in agreement with each other. To me she is the best singer I ever heard. even if you don't like opera you will love her voice. It's the best money I have ever spent.
5,Dream with me in concert,"What a voice, great choice of songs and she's so cute ! All who see this are rapt.Would make a great present ."
5,Excellent Video and Sound,Highly recommendable. Great piece of blueray disc. Jackie can really hit the high note flawlessly. She's amazing young operatic artist.
4,Good Music,good music to listen to and a good singing voice for her age concidering she is only 11 at the time
1,Terrible sound quality,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law, who is 94. She loves both music, and children, so it seemed like it would be a great choice for her. Unfortunately, if the volume is turned up at all, the sound quality of the orchestra is awful, with lots of distortion. Since she has some hearing loss, the volume has to be turned up for her to be able to hear and enjoy it. The maximum volume setting on her television is 50, but if we went over 12, the sound was so bad that it wasn't worth listening to. I returned the disc, and got a replacement, but it had the very same issue. I returned it as well, and decided to give up, and get a refund. It was really disappointing, since I know that she would have really enjoyed it if the quality had been good."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Jackie is a fantastic prodigy and I enjoyed the PBS broadcast. However, the sound quality of this DVD is very poor and a big disappointment. I am sorry we made the purchase."
2,Worst....Book....Ever,This book reads of one written by an obese transvestite. Freaking awful. I'd rather have used the time I spent reading it in a monestary taking lessons on how to be a fire monk
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is one of the worst things I have ever read. I personally think it should be taken off the market and locked away. The domestic violence in this collection is so awful that it should never be printed again.
5,Its bling bling to da max,"I thought this book was ""interesting"" cuz i DIDNT UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT!!!! KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST VIOLENT COLLECTION OF POEMS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! But besides that its interesting and hopefully everyone will enjoy it."
2,Gandhi & I Are Saying Goodbye: A Collection of Poems,"I thought this book was ""good"" at best, with average grade poems. I still think that the author, has potential to be a great poet. Some of these poems were outstanding and some were very boring. I half-heartedly reccomend this book and, for Adult audiences only, due to the domestic violence in her poems."
4,A very good and rare album,"-- a word from France ; please, excuse my very very bad english. I think it's a very precious and rare album ; not without weaknesses (sometimes the voice of Kat Maslich is too dark, or gloomy... -- to make a long story short : i prefer the titles where Peter Adams begins the singing), but what we can hear in this album is a precious meeting : one atmosphere, one production, one sound, a kind of miracle, if you want. Not to be missed."
4,Great CD!,"I bought this for the ""So Are You To Me"" song, but was pleasantly surprised at the rest of the content. I would recommend this to anyone who likes soft harmonies and sweet songs."
2,alt-country pop crap,"To me this is just another example of a major label giving a chance to same young musicians with limited talent and little to offer, in this case a looking toward the alt-country market. To these ears, this is a boring record from start to finish, starting off w/ Stephen Foster's civil war era ""Hard Times"" as if this song has been rediscovered by this ensemble or something. It's either pretentious or simpleminded but it just doesn't work for me & i think sets the record off very poorly. Perhaps the band can improve, but like many of these types of bands I feel that it is just imitation at best, and in this case not a good one of mountain type music, slicked up in Hollywood."
2,Stealth Christians,"This album is a disappointment. I heard a nice-sounding clip on the radio and thought they might be a good band to check out. But when I got the CD, I had to play it twice to make sure it really was as boring as it seemed the first time. The voices are sweet enough, but there's not a single interesting or compelling lyric on the whole album. About the only songs that seem to have any feeling or sincerity are the religious ones. Oh, great: stealth Christians doing agonizingly bland and forgettable folk-rock. Just what the world needs now."
4,Great CD,"Great CD, echos of Indigo Girls, Nickel Creek, and other but definitely unique. Buy it, love it!KAC"
5,Books on Character,My daughter requested books by this author for her children and they enjoy the stories and the content.
4,one star short of galaxy,"BIRMINGHAM J 's album is a good project for a solo artist however the one that carries the fire aint J, its the lil grilled out dude from ensley. I am proud J the pimp[ first real stage name] handled his biz ,on the bizniz tip because it shows on the album,hope number two is a troubleshooter reunion,where the true allstar roster shows up for the event!"
4,A well-researched summary of a bygone era.,"A fascinating look at a sport which no longer exists in our country. Wonderfully researched and complete with photos, I read it immediately. A must read for anyone interested in Frank Gotch."
4,Interesting/worthwhile,DVD has some interesting information. It could serve as an introduction into the poem. It's not going to offer much new to anyone who's studied the poem or the history in much detail. I enjoyed watching it.
2,I beg to differ!,I was very disappointed in this very short and not very informative film. As there could of been a lot more added to this film but was not. Like what was it like to live in Dark Ages? What was the food like? (It was I bet it was pretty bad to our tastes) How do you survive? (You pledge yourself to the local strong man) Why was it such a warrior culture? (Because the Legions had left and there was a power vacuum to fill) How did the church spread? What did Old English sound like (There is a very brief amount of it in the start of the film)and then how did it evolve to what we speak today. Also how was Sutton Woo excavated? Why were the items found there not explained to us? etc etc. Its a pity as it is a period of history that is really interesting and it deserves better!
3,"Good information, but not really good for high school","First off, I agree with most of the reviews about this DVD. The information is first-rate, and I found it to be fascinating. However, when I showed it to my English Literature Honors class, they had to fight not to go to sleep. Again, the information is first rate, but the narration is difficult to follow, rather quiet and droning."
2,Toreo arrogance,"This book was written because the author wanted a book credit to his name, not to inform the public. There is a lot of valuable information that one has to dig for among the literary mish mash."
5,PERFECT VOICE TO SING ALONG WITH,"I purchased this one for my 97 year old mother. Her memory has been fading, but when listening to this particular CD, her memory is perfect!! She sings along to every one of the songs and remembers every word. Great CD for the elderly."
5,I love his music,"I saw him in Santa Monica california playing his strange guitar some of the most beautiful creations. I bought three of his cd's right there. Now I aim to get the rest off of Amazon. I stood listening to him for at least an hour, asking him questions. He didn't tire of me, he was very kind and answered them all. That was around 2002 or 3. Listen to a few of his songs here on Amazon. Cool sounds, relaxing. Peaceful. His music comes from the love in his heart. I am a musician, I play the harp, so it wasn't too hard to pick up on his kindness and generosity. I hope he makes a great living from his music."
5,"Read Midnight Rain, then pre-order Last Girl Dancing","Midnight Rain is a taut, fast-paced roller-coaster ride through the dark side of the human experience. Once you start this novel, you will have to finish it in one sitting. It's that good. Ms. Lisle's first entry into the suspense field is a sure winner. You must read this book.Coming up is Lisle's Last Girl Dancing, due out in July. Sneak previews of the first 2 chapters are available at Silent Bounce ( http://www.hollylisle.com/writingdiary free registration required) and show that LGD is at least as good as Midnight Rain. Pre-order this one now. Don't be left out when it sells out.Holly Lisle's writing is a model for how good novels are made. Good, believable characters in dire situations that just keep getting worse, and action that never gives you a chance to breathe. Highly recommended."
5,"A great thriller, an excellent story","A great story with excellent character developement. I found myself wrapped up in the story so much I read the book in one sitting, staying up till 3am on a work night! Just could not put it down. Interesting, and thought provoking, kept me guessing till the end. And the love story that is interwound through the entire thing was excellent. Great work Holly, keep it up, I cannot wait for your next book!"
4,love Holly Lisle,There isn't a book of hers that I haven't enjoyed. She manages the suspense and the creep factor and the romance very well.
4,Great Book with Practical Applications,"First of all, I love the title. It certainly describes my situation perfectly and Im sure many readers relate. This book is well written and contains an enormous amount of practical information that I have been able to apply in my life. After all, books are worthless unless I can apply the information I learn from them in my life. Thus, this title is well worth the time. Highly recommended and remember always to put your children as the # 1 priority in your situation."
3,"Lots of good prractical advice, but not for every situation","This book really helped me get a grip on things that the attorney's and the court don't tell you because they are too busy raping you and your ex for every dime you have earned and keeping you at one another's throats.The book doesn't focus enough on the kids in my opinion, but it does focus on how to deal with a difficult ex that is bent on making your life as miserable as possible."
2,"Good Rhythm, Bad recordin","Stan kicks butt. A little more than usual even.But, the distortion really detracts from the album. When one listens to Kenton's stuff, the horns are always a highlight. Unfortunately, the recording quality doesn't allow them to come through.If you really don't notice recording quality much, it's quite nice."
5,Really Neat book,"It is really neat to see how it was before I lived there. Great pictures and history,I would recommend this to anyone interested in the past."
3,Interesting,Because it was written by Carnegie in 1905 it tells a great deal about him and how he thought at that time. He gives an outline of the life of Watt but says more about how he feels about inventions and business and management.
4,Good Biography,"How much do we really know about James Watt? About 100 years ago, Andrew Carnegie wrote this biography about his fellow Scot, who was instrumental in industrializing the world. James Watt invented the steam engine, which enabled us to have steam locomotives, steamboats, and made steel production infinitely easier, thus really creating the world we have today. This was a book I downloaded for one of my sons, who needed to read a biography for a school book review. While there were parts of the book which my son said were dry, overall it was an interesting and informative book about someone who was quite important to the world in which we live today."
3,Seems like a knock-off,Doesn't seem to be as potent as the original. seems like more alcohol content. not sure if i will purchase again
1,Metaphysics Contemporary Readings Review,"The first day I received this book, it fell apart. Half of the pages are falling off the spine and some of the pages are cut unevenly.I'm very displeased with this item, but I can't return it because I need it for class, even though its a struggle trying to find the pages I need to read once they've fallen out of the book."
1,Check the size!,"Check the size dimensions. This item is listed as an assessory for the Sony VAIO laptop/notebook. However, the vast majority of VAIOs do not fit in this carrying case."
2,Misleading title,"Only about 5 or 10 pages of the book are about the liberation of the camp. Large portions of the military action are not even touched on. The first part is a general descripiton of the war situation and most of the book is interviews with internees about their time in the camp. No real time-line or story just disjointed personal accounts. Agonizing little about the soldiers, the fighting, the rescue, or the aftermath.I have read just about every book on this subject as my Father was in the 1st Cav and participated in the liberation of Santo Tomas and in the later fight for Manila and this is my least favorite book. I guess it might be a slightly better book if it was titled, ""Short Interviews with former Interns of Santo Tomas"""
4,A helpful guide,Abingdon Press does a credible job in assembling basics for the church office professional. This handy book starts with a discussion of the secretary's role and the potential for unrealistic expectations by the pastor or congregation. A good investment for those who work in the church office. A secretary might even want to share this with her/his supervisors : )
5,One of the best books I've read in a long time!,"I'm usually disappointed in a lot of books, since usually the story itself would be excellent except the characters are undeveloped and the plot isn't good with a bad ending. This book was excellent, and will be one of my favorites for a long time. ""Jesse"" and Louisa are two lovable characters, and their stories keep you reading. Since one chapter would be about ""Jesse"" and the next about Louisa, I couldn't stop reading so that I could find out what happened to each of them! :o)"
3,Good,A good read. Not as good as her 'blessing' series but still interesting. Could be a little predictable at times.
5,Daughter of Twin Oaks( A Secret Refuge Series #1): Book 1,"If you like history of the Civil War, this book is for you. It is a story with many twists and turns; intrigue,compassion, danger, courage and love for home and family. I read all three of the books in this series. My husband is now reading this one and he isn't an avid reader."
5,Red River of the North series-all 6 books,"They are fantastic..I hung on every situation, actually feeling like I was living out the life they did. A very gifted author. Having many ancestors who came from Norway and settled in the Red River Valley, I felt History come alive. Thank you Lorraine Snelling!"
3,A average book,"I searched the index etc before buying so knew I thought ,What to expect in this book.It is mainly for basic single point distributors.It does tell you how to recurve a factory distributor.I would like to see what to buy in different points, hot coils and leads.How the top aftermarket point coils compare,how the analog vs digital multi spark boxes compare with points ,Crane,MSD,Mallory etc.Also tips on fusing and protecting Boxes/Modules like on the Century performance site would save tuners hundreds.I would like to find out when you need to go from points to a conversion kit, and pros and cons.(You can always get home redoing points vs a burnt out electronic system......)Also how to not waste money on trick of the week stuff or buying more than you need.I am going back and buying older books on this subject to learn more.If you have standard points,standard coils and just want to recurve the distributor then this is a good book."
2,Not as advertised,This is a high fast and loud recording. I bought this because it claimed to have Bob Havens on the recording. Wrong. More like Jerry Hirt who is no where in Mr. Havens league.
3,Good but way out-of-date,"Released in the 1990s, Hall's book was cool but dated very quickly. Back then, there were only three foreigners in the top division. Now the upper ranks are dominated by foreigners and no Japanese has won a tournament for six years. Hence I wrote a more up-to-date guide with more wrestler interviews for Kindle."
5,Words cannot describe his performances,"I have had the extreme pleasure of seeing Charlie Byrd perform many times in Annapolis,MD where he resides. Each time I see him, he seems to play better and better. Jazz & Samba is a beautiful blend of styles that leaves one wanting the music to never end. He is truly a master above all."
5,"Incredible reading, could not put it down.","This book held me every step of the way. I borrowed it from the library, but felt it must be a definite addition to my home library. What a wonderful testimony to the human spirit: for one to rise above such adverse circumstances, and then to be able to put it on paper in such beautiful prose. This is a China every informed person should know about."
3,I had no problem putting it down,The non linar approach kept me thinking there would be some big supprizing reward at the end of the book. To my disappointment there was no such revolation. Not an awfully written story but certinally no prize winner in my book!
4,Its so beautiful!,"I love these series of hymns because they are so relaxing and encouraging. The music is soothing and yet inspiring, esspecially when i can sing along with the hymn music. I just wish there was more music on one CD compiled all together but its still alright!"
3,Great for the Northern Hemisphere,"If you live in the Northern Hemisphere then this would be a great book to add to your collection. The author gives you ideas and a system of how to go about learning what you need to know if you want to self-initiate. However, everything is according to the Northern Hemisphere and there is no mention that if you live in the other half of the world you might want to consider turning things around.A classic mistake is explaining that deosil means to walk clockwise. It does not. It means to walk in the direction of the sun's path from east to west. In the Southern Hemisphere that is counter clockwise. Things like this are important to get right as it is very possible that someone reading this book and following may not be aware or the regional bias of the author.For this reason I give the book 3 stars - a half way mark because its only really relevant to half the world."
2,More Wicca,"I was hoping for a book more about Witchcraft than Wicca. All the stuff about degrees and priestesses made me wonder why it is about being a solitary witch. There is good in the book as well. Don't buy this book if you are looking for basic Witchcraft, or if you don't want to hear anymore about Wicca. On the other hand if you like Wicca this is the book for you."
2,Dancing around the Throne,"After 8-9 others rated this book a 5 star, I thought I could not go wrong. Unfortunately, I read the first few chapters andI was highly disappointed. I read one to my wife and she was also disappointed. Chero'Ne appears to me to be an amateur author and amateur artist, i.e. it is not written either grammatically very well, nor did it capture my interest and I feel like I could do equal or better illustrations (and I am clearly an amateur artist). In addition, there were typo's.She appears to be saying ""I am great"", ""I am wonderful"", ""I am really terrific"", ""God is good"". The spiritual message escaped me. I wish her well, I dislike writing this, but if I am spending $14.50 for a paperback, I don't want to have to send it back out of disappointment. Perhaps if I had read more, it would have gotten better, but I couldn't bring myself to do that."
5,Exceptional!,"After reading ""At San Jose, Make a Left"" by this author, I could hardly wait to get this book. I was NOT disappointed, either. She delivers in everyway and every story is a one of a kind wonderful tale about the normalcies of life and retold in such a way to make you really take stock and think. And rethink. Over and over again. This is outstanding book by an up and coming author that deserves to be on the best-seller list. You will not be disappointed with this album of life stories that take a picture of YOU and help you to see where you are at and where you should be going. It's a great book. Hopes she writes more."
4,little jing is cute,"i was already a jing fan so i'm a little biased, still as much as i loved seeing some of his past, (he's such a cute little kidly wink) it wasn't as good as the series, but still a realy worthwhile show to see."
5,Amazing but True,"In this book, Dannie Martin and Peter Sussman have done more to shed light on the idiocy of our prison system than any other book I have read on the subject.Dannie Martin is a convicted criminal, and I expected the usual whining about the system and how he got a poor trial, etc. Instead, what I found was a series of insightful articles written about the prison system by someone who has the ultimate in first hand knowledge. Interwoven with that was the story of the Federal Bureau of Prisons attempts to quiet the man who was exposing their dirty laundry.Dannie Martin is a natural writer with a wonderful sense of humor. Far from being dry, this book was extremely readable and enjoyable. I think anyone who is helping to foot the bill for the Federal Prison system needs to read this book!!"
4,"Good Product, but dusty haha!","Fast, great service! Got it in just a few days and arrived in good condition. Only thing wrong if I had to find one was that it was really dusty, like it was sitting around for a while. But all in all great product and would buy from seller again."
2,Quality not what I expected.,"I have had this machine in my office for a couple of years now, and I am hoping to be able to afford a replacement now. This machine has a number of poorly constructed components. My biggest frustration has been the Fuser, which has frequently jammed up since the first six months we had the machine, and requires unscrewing in order to remove the jammed paper. This machine was not what I expected for the price paid."
3,Includes a Few Relaxing Songs,"Although I enjoyed a few relaxing songs on the ""Peaceful Planet"" CD, I found that several of the tunes actually grated on my nerves - so it hasn't been a good relaxation/meditation CD for me.Because musical preferences are so subjective, however, I would suggest listening to the snippets of each song available on the product page before ordering - you may have a different reaction to this particular type of music than I have."
4,Not Your Average Day,"""Lucky Me"" stands out as a unique film for two reasons. First, it was the first musical to be filmed in CinemaScope. Second, Doris filmed it while she was on the mend of nervous exhustion. To see Miss Day's breezy and carefree performance, one would never guess that she was having to muster every ounce of available energy just to get through the filming. She so stated in her autobiography, ""Doris Day: Her Own Story."" Doris is a much underestimated performer who made her work seem so effortless. In this film, Miss Day demonstrates that against all odds, she gives a completely charming and gratifing performance. She is supported by Bob Cummings, Phil Harris and the hilarious Nacy Walker. This film improves with each viewing as you admire Doris Day, a true artist, at work."
4,Lucky Me,Doris Day stars as Phil Silvers partner in his Broadway show that is a flop called Parisian Pretties a long with 2 other people. Phil is a down and out person who is a looser and a free loader who depends on Doris for the rent and a lot of other things. Doris meets a famous screen wright while working at a HOTEL to pay off their big debt and when Phil finds out he tries to convince her to tell them about him and to try to get him to help them out and get them a chance in the big life. But Doris teaches Phil that the best way to get anywhere is to work for it! So they get into the play and turn from sad people to happy people and Doris finds love.
3,Lucky Me - the movie,"This is not a noteworthy musical. Indeed, it is saved only by the singing and dancing of Doris Day. Phil Silvers is on hand with his loud and zany humour. Robert Cummings is his suave sophisticated self. But the plot, such as it is, about a theatrical group stranded in Miami, is feeble and the only real entertainment here are the songs: 'Lucky me', and the 'Superstition song' which opens the film, the jolly comedy dance number 'Bluebells of Broadway',the lovely 'I speak to the stars', and several others, rather less memorable. They were composed by Sammy Fain (music) and Paul Francis Webster (lyrics). This is one for DD fans only."
4,Ornament,"This is a lovely little ornament, just right for our Christmas tree. However, though marketed as a possible display piece, this is too small for conventional display."
4,Have a Blast with Mag-Blast,"Mag-Blast is fun light wargame. Best with 2 players. You each have a fleet of various space ships which you arrange to defend your command ship. Then with the luck of cards drawn you are able to launch attacks and/or defend your fleet. The theme is comical and it's a ""blast"" when you are able to destroy the enemy. The games last from 10 to 30 minutes."
1,Dont buy this,Ok i had this gun for a week and the magazine jammed. I got a new one and the plastic holding part fell apart and the barrel also fell off.
1,Paper thin,This Handicap stencil was not heavy enough for making more than a few spots. I used it for 12 spots and it fell apart on the 9th time I used it. The paint (brushed) made it so wet that it became weak.This type of stencil needs to be out of plastic or rubber.You get what you pay for.
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"This product is without a doubt the worst piece of garbage on the market. The software does not work. Technical support is terrible. First I had to download ""updated software"". Even with broadband this took 2 1/2 hours. The new software did not work. I run XP Home Edition. Another call to technical support and another brainless idiot tells me that the software does not capture video yet! They are working on it! Also, no toll free number. You pay for the call. You will wait at least 1/2 hour before talking to a tech. The hardware also does not work with other video software. I tried VideoWave III and Microsoft Movie Maker. The hardware is not recognized. The media readers do not work because Dazzle did not ship drivers! No drivers available on the web site. This product is pure garbage and the company stinks as does their so called tech support."
1,Not ready for prime time,"After hours of frustration, I finally found this paragraph I am pasting directly from dazzle's web site...Currently DVD Complete cannot capture Audio and Video using the DCS 200, DVC 100, DVC 150,or DVC 80. We are aware of this issue and are working towards and update for DVD Complete that will allow capture directly into the DVD Complete software....At least the card reader part still works, albeit a very expensive card reader!"
1,never buy used electronics,"Bought this with intentions to transfer HI 8 video to hard drive, I am running windows 7 and there are no drivers available at all. If i would have known this I never would have wasted my money"
1,USB Video capture sucks,"Even if you manage to get the software run,..., usb just can't keep up, I always get the video with lots of drop frames and audio glitches, a PCI capture board is a much better choice."

1,really bad softwares,"all of the softwares needed fixeds/upgrades.even after all the downloads/upgraded,softwares still not totally fixed."
2,"Good product, poorly stored prior to shipment","First, my parrot (CAG) LOVES this stuff! So, kudos to Pretty Bird for an exceptional product.My concern: the product arrived with an unacceptable 'bug' load. There were live weevils, or some such insect, in the mix when opened and much bug waste/byproducts of their metabolic funtions (read poop).This, to me, is simply unacceptable.I have purchased this product locally in the past with none of the bug problems stated above, so it is my opinion the contamination occured at some point after it left Pretty Bird.The company it shipped from was called, I believe, Pet Solutions.I will be buying this one from Foster and Smith next time."
4,very beautiful designs,"Since it is an inspirational book full of colors and techniques, my mind relaxed into a creative mode."
1,Give Me A Break!,"Who wants to read about somebody changing almost everything, even their name to, Spike. Just to have cool things written about them! Give me a break!"
2,Overly Simplistic,"This book was so simplistic. I was quite disappointed. You get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all. A worthy goal, but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies I really think one should try to pursue things to their limit. He really held back from delving into any dark territory. His explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit. He always managed to put a happy, positive spin on everything, which is nice, but life isn't that simple."
2,don't bother,"This book was way too simplistic. And, frankly, I just thought he was downright wrong in a few cases. Try The Erotic Mind for a book that is a lot more intelligent on this matter."
3,Too Simple,"Bader fails to find a way to communicate complex psychoanalytic theory to the general reader. In this way his book works neither as theory nor self-help. This is not to say it's without useful ideas, only that they are not presented effectively for either therapist or general reader."
3,Hunter fans be aware!,"After listening to MIA I'm a little surprised that Ian allowed this to see the light of day. The song selection is good, the performances are great but the audio quality is horrible, a bad bootleg at best. If you can overlook the sound it's a great addition to the Hunter collection. Interestingly enough the Import with the bonus disk Collateral Damage, the sound quality is much better!"
1,"Save your money, folks....","I'm just curious as to why this...thing was released when Chrysalis released the same thing in 1980 (OK, that's the ""Collateral Damage"" edition of this thing.) The sound is horrid, the material is even worse, and Ian and Ronno deserve so MUCH better. MY guess is that this crud was rush-released in 2000 to coincide with that ""Once Bitten Twice Shy"" thing, which itself was justifiable only because of the inclusion of the 3 movie soundtrack songs. Buy the INFINITELY superior ""Welcome To The Club,"" it's worth what you'd have to pay for its ""import"" status."
4,All the hits are NOT here,"This doesn't have ""That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)"", a top-10 hit in the USA. As far as I can tell that's the only Billboard top-40 hit it doesn't have."
4,The best volume in the cool devices series!,"Yellow Star is probably the best 'operation' among all of the Cool Devices series. Its animation quality is at least 2 notches above the rest of the pack. The character designer is a very famous one, he's the same one who created the characters in the anime series 'Megazone'. Other than great arts, the plot line was also good. It's loaded with a lot of suspense, hot actions, and a twisted ending. This is indeed a rarity in the hentai genre. :)"
1,Cannot buy it.,I live outside the US. When I tried to buy it Amazon refused due to Geographical location restriction of the product. Where is it mentioned? I don't see it!!!
5,"Wow - a definite ""Must Read""","If you've enjoyed the work of another Maine horror writer, hold on to your socks, because there's a new guy in town. The Pink Room combines excellent characterization and often terrifying descriptions with an original storyline which makes the read as a whole truly entertaining and enjoyable. Add the twists and turns, and it becomes profound and thought-provoking as well. Worthy of purchase - you won't be disappointed."
4,Provocative but not insightful,"This book stimulated me to think about the nature of friendship, but ultimately it was somewhat unsatisfying because the author did not seem to have any special insights of his own.For a person who clearly considers himself to be rather reserved, the author was very candid about his own friendships and attitudes towards his friends (leaving me glad I am not among them!), but he seemed too quick to generalize without any apparent basis. There also seemed to be a tendency to ""name drop"", as if he felt the quality of his Friends List would give stature to his conclusions.Nonetheless, the book was an interesting exploration of an important subject that most people do not think about. Many of Epstein's pronouncements made me ponder about my own concept of friendship, which was a worthwhile experience, even when I ultimately found many of his ideas inaccurate or unconvincing."
1,Do not waste your money.,This was the most boring book I have had the mispleasure of reading. Our book club chose it based on a review one of our members read. Needless to say after every member complained about the book and found nothing positive to say we looked into other reviews and found them to match our opinion. Do not waste your money on this book.
5,Awesome flash back.,"There are some real gems on this DVD. Betty boop and the little king, woody wood pecker, gumby and the dragon, and others. My 3 year old daughter is loving these old cartoons. I love this DVD cartoons range from the 30s to 80s. They don't shows these cartoons on tv any more."
3,New Owner,"Nespresso C185T Le Cube Automatic Espresso Machine, Titan GrayI like the ease of making expresso using the capsules and the blends offered are very good. The look of the machine is very attractive to my kitchen counter. However, the machine has begun constant dripping after use and I have to place a small cup to catch the dripping. Clean up of the capsules and trays are very easy. I thought I read that the machine dispense was pre-set per button whether 2oz or 4 oz. I have to hold down the button of choice until the desired level then release. Would I buy another auto expresso the answer is yes. The things I have listed are minor irratations. San Antonio, Texas"
3,Advertised more than it is,"It feels good on the feet, but too much pressure (feet relaxed on it) cause the motor to sound strained. It says deep kneading, but it definitely is not 'deep'. Left the heat part on for 10 minutes and it still not feel warm. All in all, not worth the money but it feels good if you hold your feet up on it."
1,Broke in less than two months!,"While it still worked, it was pleasant to use this foot massager under my desk while working on the computer at home. I wore socks and was careful not to put too much pressure on the ball bearings (you can tell when the motor is straining). In spite of this, one day the motor just refused to turn on. The rotating pads were ""locked up"", and after some careful disassembly it seems to be the cheap motor and not the plastic gears that are the problem. Not much point in keeping it as a foot warmer since this was not a strong point. Did not even bother trying to see if I could get it replaced under warranty."
1,Broken In Two Days!,"This was a great product, for a couple of days! Got it for Christmas, and it broke December 27th! It does seem cheap-the little balls that roll around are not metal, as they should be, but plastic, and have ridges from where they are put together so they kind of hurt if wearing thin socks. I will find out if I can get this item replaced but I am unsure if I want it replaced, if it will just break again!"
1,Poor design,I should be able to put my feet on it and not have to flex my leg muscles and basically lift my feet to reduce the pressure being applied to the top surface of the foot massager so that it can operate. It should have a powerful enough motor that it can rotate with out me regulating the pressure.Better yet; It should in fact have been designed with the rotating discs being spring loaded and the balls within those discs also being spring loaded and the surrounding base being a little larger that way it gives underneath the foot and applies a specific pressure across the bottom of the foot which would be determined by the spring not the weight of the leg.
3,good looking product,"the dish drainer is very stylish looking & spacious, but the bottom is useless, had to buy a seperate bottom that allowed for drainage into my sink. Plus, beware bottom is very sharp, my husband cut himself badly on the edge."
5,Fabulous and Cover-Worn,"My baby boy loved this so much he kept ""reading"" it until the covers fell off and the pages fell out (which is no easy feat, since it is well constructed). I bought it for him when he was a year and a half and he got at least three full years of enjoyment out of it. Hands down it has been his favorite book of all time (he just turned five). I wish they had written a French Dictionary too!"
1,Easy to install but spray wand malfunctioned after 3 weeks,"The installation was not too bad although it was a bit unclear how to attach the bracket to the bowl; turns out there are 2 mutually exclusive sets of hardware and you have to figure out which one to use. But the real problem is that it malfunctioned after 3 weeks of light use, and in a very unpleasant way. When you have stood up, and are facing the toilet, reaching for the flush handle, the unit goes through a self cleaning cycle. But our unit also sprays water up into your face from the 'wand' that has just finished spraying another part of your body. We are now seeking a warranty replacementl for this ironically unsanitary unit."
4,"Beautifully illustrated, targeted to Web artists & designers","This is a beautifully illustrated text packed full of illustrations and design descriptions for 14 case studies of taking traditional print media to the WEB, ""brick and mortar"" to ""click and mortar"". Each project focuses on how designers overcame the problems involved in translating printer material to the WEB. The text is very heavy into full color illustrations and graphics to illustrate both the original print projects and the final WEB implementation. This text will benefit those involved in WEB design from a layout and final product perspective, and is targeted more towards graphic artists than WEB programmers. It is not a text for learning Web programming (e.g. HTML, JavaScript, XML, etc.). The text lists the URLs for the projects, and the companion CD provides links to 200 related design sites."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this book. I read the first few pages and was fascinated. The first story in the book had some great character pathology in it, telling the tale of an obsessed man from his point of view, but the rest of the book was literally nonsensical. It was like Dr. Seuss stories without the charming rhymes or colorful pictures if they had material unfit for children. The plots were even less well-developed than that lesser of Seuss's classics, One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. This book is a bit like that New York art gallery that I once visited that had a jar of urine on exhibit as a work of art: the bizarre is being passed off as creative. The first story is worth reading, but the rest can be skipped in favor of the more intellectually vigorous Horton Hears a Who."
3,Decent DVD,"As others have said, this is not a concert DVD in the usual sense, but rather it tracks the ""evolution"" of the group, with lots of ""cinema verite"" touches. The parts shot in Portland during Y2K are somewhat embarrassing to a portlander, but then now we have ""Portlandia,"" which is what we so richly deserve. A much better concert dvd of SCI is the Denver Fillmore collection. THIS dvd violates one of my ""concert video"" rules: Never, EVER, interrupt a live performance with a stupid offset interview, or, in the case of this mess, a lovely ""nature"" video. If I want that crap, I'll watch AMTRAK commercials for the soaring eagles, rushing rivers, etc., etc. On the other hand, I got this thing used for about five bucks, postage included..."
5,String Cheese Incident Rocks,A great film. Great soundtrack and they did a great job capturing the events and emotions behind the music and the family. It brought me to joyful tears twice.Better than Phish's Bittersweet Motel.A true Incident!
1,This band is seriously overrated and so is this dvd.,"For the love of all that is holy, when are people going to realize that SCI is a mediocre bar band at best, featuring warmed over jams that rip off all of the more accomplished and more talented ""jam"" bands out there? I had the misfortune of sitting through this sad excuse for a documentary/concert film at a friend's house and it is an evening I have lost forever. Do yourself a favor and don't buy, much less see, this dvd. Instead, save your money to invest in some cd's or dvd's of the dozens and dozens of much better bands out there, or better yet, go and see some real live music at your favorite local venue. I guarantee whichever band you happen to see will blow the pants of these shoeless wonders."
3,Soft Reed that Doesn't Work Well with my playing style,This is a surprisingly soft reed that has a very short modeled edge from the base. I play on a Larry Combs series mouthpiece and the two do not gel well together. Response on the reed is rather muddy and slow and I am unable to achieve the brightness out of the reed that I want from other brands in its price range. As is the case with all reeds though you need to find the right one for your embouchure and mouthpiece.
1,Wish I would have known,"Seller is great, Product is garbage, Wiring diagrams are Teeeny weeeny,The ones that you down load from their web site is totally wrong, The one their tech sent me didn't work either Product does not work at all, Cannot ever get dimarzio support on the phone so I have an expensive lesson, Then I'm going to rip them out and throw them at cars on the highway, Really the MIM stock were better,, They worked! So save your money, Buy a nice set of anything but these, Pure crap and no customer support, Unless you enjoy wasting your money then your gonna love these."
4,Cast A Giant Shadow,I have always liked this movie & its better on DVD than VHS. I can give that away now. More people should watch the older movies sometimes they are more entertaining than the new ones.
3,"Birth of a Nation, Oy Vey!","Everyone has made such interesting reviews here, I just wanted to add a few unnoticed items.1) Kirk Douglas is kick-ass in this film (which unfortunately always has struck me as flat ginger ale--I'd love to see Spielberg remake it).2) Let's be forgiving of the drudgery and clear lack of budget: consider its release year of 1966. Plus they had to pay John Wayne and Frank Sinatra!3) Maybe just me, but I was almost offended by the clown who played David Ben Gurion, and the battle scenes were just a little 'California backyard' for my taste. After all, Wayne did well with battle scenes in ""The Alamo""--if he did it, why couldn't these guys?4) This is truly an unavoidable film, because its history and message are vital. I love the way Col. Marcus finally realized HE'S JEWISH!! He fits in somewhere!!"
3,The making of Israel,"A good movie, especially considering the cast. Kirk Douglas is great, as always, as is Yul Brynner (although it's hard sometimes to tell if Yul is acting or just being Yul).The movie looks at the beginnings of Israel and the role of Marcus, a former U.S. Army officer, in winning the battle against the Arabs who tried to invade from the surrounding countries when independence was declared.Only a few flaws keep this from being an outstanding movie, notably the over-use of flashbacks. Either Marcus' experiences in Europe and Washington should have been summed up early in the movie or else some other plot device used to explain how he came to feel like he had to do something for Israel.Still, a good movie that avoids any of the PC hand-wringing one sees so often in these sorts of things."
3,A strange movie about a Jewish war hero,"In the American army as a Jew he only got so high, butthey made him a top general in Israel in 1948.His trick of using jeep mounted antiaircraft gunsto defeat the Egyptian tanks shows you why.The new road he build to Jerusalem is real history.Micky Marcus is an American Jew who hasn'tbeen given his due in history?Everyone thought Israel was throughbefore they began in 1948!"
1,Cast a Giant Shadow - could not play,I did not look closely enough at the product description to see the DVD was in PAL format and would not play on my US DVD player. Product description should have had a much more prominent description / alert the DVD was not in US format.Could not play the movie. Cannot comment on content.
1,Cast a Giant Shadow,"It was sent to me in a PAL format instead of NTSC so I could not view it,there isn't any thing else to say"
3,CAST A GIANT SHADOW,OK FILM; NOT MANY ON THE SUBJECT OF ISRAEL'S WAR OF INDEPENDENCE SO IT IS WORTHWHILE TO OWN. GOOD CAST.
1,"not family friendly, lingo and sexuality","We bought this film, saw a version from library that made us return this before opening it. We returned it, paid the 3 dollar fee for doing so. Bad language and sex outside of marriage throughout. There are better films about the history of Israel to buy, and be inspired by. Cannot recommend this film!"
1,very unhappy,i still have not received this. ordered one month ago as a holiday gift. it is now a day away from Feb.I am totally dissatisfied!
3,READ A BOOK INSTEAD,"There are big names in the cast:DOUGLAS who is not to blame,WAYNE in a nice supporting role,SINATRA in a ridiculous cameo as a pilot on his soundstage,BRYNNER far away from THE KING AND I and gorgeous ladies DICKINSON and BERGER.Yet this film does not succeed in telling a complex story oversimplified to say the least.We don't click with these characters that we don't beleive in.Save your time by reading a good book on the subject instead."
1,"Great story, lame movie","Hokey is right. This film now seems terminally dated, with stilted dialogue, cheesy flashbacks, implausible female characters, and all the narrative energy of a dead flashlight battery. The only high points are some action scenes and comic relief provided by the great Israeli actor Topol (playing an Arab sympathetic to the Israeli cause).Why hasn't anyone ever made a GREAT movie about Israel's fight for independence? ""Exodus"" is marginally superior (I like Paul Newman better than Kirk Douglas), but burdened by a glacial pace."
1,Historically inaccurate,"While this is a nice film to watch from perspective of big-time American cinema of yesteryear, it is historically inaccurate and minimizes the tremendous Israeli military intelligence and strategic capability even then. Moshe Dayan et al did not need Kirk Douglas or any other American to teach them how to think or fight. Israeli military leadership has been the envy of the world at many times and the concept that a plucky American with capped teeth led the charge during the War of Independence is an insult to these brilliant fighters. NOBODY was tougher and smarter than Dayan, sorry."
3,Anything but!,"No track from ""Celebration""?That is a huge joke,because that is Brown's best album ever,infact it's hard to see him will outdo himself on any future release.I can't believe that he didn't include material from what most people consider his best work.That for me kills off the idea of a ""Best of..."" compilation.I feel the guy is just trying to remind us where he's been,because I would have flooded an album titled as such with tracks from a gem of a piece of work.No ""Outa Nowhere"", no ""Celebration"",no ""Breaking Out"",no ""Paradise""...what am i looking back at?Not rubbishing his career,though.He's had a great one so far,except that his last full release was terrible.He owes us fans an apology for trying to sound and feel like George Benson,as if we haven't had enough of one person and his antics.It was a lazy effort,to say the least and I hope he can do much better next time around"
4,Butcher's Moon:A Parker Novel,Very easy reading and never ending excitement! Very violent and if you are squeamishI'd stay away. Parker is a hard-nosed bad guy but I was rooting for him all the way!
3,Waiting Patiently?,"Can't wait for the University of Chicago Press reprint of this extremely difficult to find crime novel. Their edition will probably allow many of us to complete the series.PS. Now in AUgust, U of Chicago Press has reissued DEADLY EDGE & SLAYGROUND; Butchers Moon should be the next and last of their PARKER series.C'mon Chicago!"
2,This 'B' Film Needed Some Lulls,"I'll say one thing about this film: there are no lulls. You can't get bored watching this. The problem is that it is TOO intense. There is too much action and it NEEDS lulls! That is the risk you take in modern action films. You want it interesting but not overdone. This is way overdone.Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of ""names"" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a ""B"" film. The best part of it is Scheider's dialog: the only ""A"" part of this ""B"" film.The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes. One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines. That was memorable."
2,Forget about this one!! Predictable Plus!!!!,"If you are a Gary Busey or Roy Schnider fan you might sit thru this one. Basically, the plot is too predictable and the stunts are rather poor. I watched it because I like Steve Bauer and Gary Busey, but they could have made the movie more exciting with their acting abilities that they have. Gary was alright but Steve Bauer was rather disappointing. It looked like he was just walking threw his role--no joking no fun stuff-- not like he is in other roles. The movie was slow in a few places. I say rent it but do not buy this one."
2,Not much Speakman here.........,Jeff is only in two scenes in this movie. The begining and the end. Kind of discouraging. No disrespect Gary.
5,Awesome CD for kids & parents,"I love Lisa Yves's ability to get kids singing jazz and scatting! Her songs are authentically jazz style with kid appropriate lyrics. As a Music Together instructor and music teacher, I love the mixed meters, tempo changes and kid appeal of the songs. I use this CD as a mood setter before my classes, as an instrumental playalong and for dancing! I also love her other two Jazz for Kids CD's. Great product for all ages!"
1,"Garbage In, Garbage Out",Probably the lamest of his solo works to date. The Demon needs to go back to his early KISS roots and find himself!
5,Great combo pack,"This is a double album, consisting of his debut album ""Heads and Tales"", and the extended, ""City Suite"" cut of ""Sniper and Other Love Songs"", with seven cuts songs and an extended cut of ""Barefoot Boy"", that is both beautiful and haunting. Even if you already have one of the albums (or both of them), I still recommend this set as a completion of how an album was intended to be heard."
1,Don't Buy It,"This is a ""universal"" product that is supposed to fit everything. It comes with a thousand nuts, bolts, fittings and fasteners. My mechanic could not get it to fit my Durango. I went to Dodge and purchased the item made for this vehicle. It was only $50 more than this one and fit perfectly with only a few bolts. My mechanic said will be stronger too. Lund, what a rip off! Never again. Postscript: I have had the OEM part now for at least 6 months and it is great. Buy the OEM running boards, it is well worth the extra $50"
5,I sure am glad to see you again,"I have upwards of 20 Johnny Cash albums but this one is my favourites and that is saying a lot. I was overjoyed to see it re-released on CD. The title track ""I Would Like To See You Again"" is one of my favourite songs ever, and in my opinion, quintessential Johnny Cash. Great too are ""Who's Gene Autrey?"", a nostalgic tribute to the genre and the good ole boys style track ""There Ain't No Good Chain Gang"" with Waylon Jennings. If you like vintage Johnny Cash, buy it."
1,"Love the CD, but the sound quality is TERRIBLE.","This is probably my favorite Johnny Cash album of all time, which is why I am INCREDIBLY disappointed in the sound quality of this CD, and I'm rather surprised no one else has mentioned it. I bought two copies of this CD, hoping the second one would sound better, but it's the same. The original album sounded much, much better than this. There's no high end, and it all sounds muffled to me. I think the thing that's so disappointing is that since it's been released on CD I doubt they'll remaster it and release it again. I've never experienced this problem before. The songs on this album rate five stars, but the sound quality of this CD makes it unlistenable, so I give it 1 star."
4,Finally!,"I remember hearing the title song in the late seventies, and have looked for an album with that song on it for years. I did finally find this lp in a thrift store a few years ago, but it has disappeared from my house, and I am thrilled to have found this cd. It is wonderful."
5,I'd Like To See You Again,"Well I'm very happy that the albums of J.R. are seeing light again, dressed in digital clothes, especially those long deleted. The highlight of this one is a duet with Waylon Jennings ""There Ain't No Good Chain Gang"" and Johnny's son John Carter features on ""Who's Gene Autry"". What about other 70's albums? They deserve to come out that way too. There are some great records there. Well, while waiting, let's have a little of I Would Like To See You Again. And if you liked this album, go seek an entire album done with Waylon, titled ""Heroes"". Those guys are still young at heart, you know."
2,Doesn't live up to its promise,"""Page's book is a quick glance over Tarantino's films from literary studies perspective. A good companion if you want to check out approaches on how to look at the films. Everyone who hasn't read the indispensible trio Bernard-Holm-Smith yet, or everyone who just wants to read a simple, fast and uncomplicated analysis of his films, should ca nit, but the book just is not really more than that."" -Sebastian H. (Full review available at www.tarantino.info)"
4,Cool track,"R.Kelly with the Looney tunes on this cut was cool. again the Versatility&Branching out on sounds&vibes is why R.Kelly stands out so much Musically from his peers,etc... also Chapter 6 of Trapped in the Closet is a trip. all those Chapters to me are Classic. one of the most Ingenious Concpets ever thought of by a Musician. R.Kelly is a One of a Kind Musical Genius."
2,Not for Self-Learners,"Good idea, lots of content and information but heavily flawed. To add to the complexity of learning a new, dead language, the authors add a glossary organized not in the order of the English alphabet, but in the Pali order. Why not waste time looking up words? Good idea! They also fail to provide meanings for many of the words introduced in each lesson, so buy a dictionary, as many are also not in the glossary. Actual translations of the texts, if they couldn't provide the meanings of the words, would have been nice, but this is also missing. I suspect they didn't let someone who doesn't know Pali try this one out or else it is targeted for a classroom situation."
4,Dad and Aunt so enjoy it!,My Father and Aunt heard this on a bus trip they took and talked about it. so I ordered it and it was so worth it. They play it constantly and sing along to it all the time. Thank you.
3,very nice box but price ridiculous,I saw this at Barnes and Nobles for $20 and thought very nice but not worth the price. Then I thought of checking with Amazon (I usually get a better price) and the item was $22 and now it keeps increasing. Don't think it is worth more than $15 the most.
5,Loved it!!!,This book is excellent! It was very easy to read and to understand. I think every engaged Catholic couple should have to read this book as a requirement through their diocese.
4,"Interesting, but a little touchy re: tobacco usage","This movie is fun because of Fred Astaire, Tommy Steele, & Petula Clark. The songs and dances are excellent, but this movie might have a little difficulty being shown nowadays since the main goal of some of the major characters is working with tobacco for cigarettes. While not personally prudish, some may not be amused by the attention given to tobacco. All in all, an enjoyable movie!"
2,it did not work,"The movie is great, but the dvd was bad. Half way through the movie the dvd would not work. I had to send it back."
2,Classic Movie,This movie is a little slow for my taste. Doesn't really live up to my expectations especially given the director and star.
4,"Let's see YOU dance at age 69! Go, Fred!","Yes, Finian's Rainbow is a bit outdated and quirky. It had a director who should be forever banned from doing musicals (did you SEE 'One From The Heart?!' I Worked on it and it Sucked!). BUT...Fred Astaire! That's all you need to know! If you insist on more--'Old Devil Moon,' 'Look To The Rainbow,' 'If This Isn't Love,' as well as the other classic numbers already mentioned in previous reviews. Sadly, it is not yet available on dvd ('Doom and Gloom!')...happily I have a laser disc version of it and can make my own dvd! Hmmm....I think Ebay is calling me! ('When The Idle Poor Become The Idle Rich!')^^X^^"
4,"odd, in a good way","it takes a special kind of person to watch the entire movie without developing a migraine, but if you go the distance, you'll love it. it's quirky, silly, goofy, insert synonym, and it sticks with you. I first saw it when i was 10, and it's one of my favorite movies. i often find myself singing the songs, especially ""Look to the Rainbow"" and ""When I'm not Near the Girl I Love."""
4,Finian's Rainbow,"This movie is a modern version of ""Brigadoon"" set in the 60's.It is light with good songs and dancing sequences.It is very much a family movie, however probable politically incorrect in todays enviroment because the story line is centered around the production of smokeless tobbacco.Its a long movie but if you like musicals and old fashioned values you will enjoy this movie."
4,Finian's Rainbow dvd,"I purchased this because we'd done this musical in my high school years back and I loved the music, still do. And any chance to see Fred Astaire is well worth it! While the style of movie making of any kind has changed (and not always for the betterment of the plot!) it is well worth watching. Fancy tricks and special effects, not so much, use your creative imagination, that is the gold this rainbow delivers."
3,"Good Cast, but a bit too long","Fred Astaire, Tommy Steele and Petula Clark all did quite well with the script they were given, and I think Astaire's singing was better than it ever was. The movie is rather corny and there is so much singing and dancing that you begin to wonder at times if there's really a movie in there or just a concert. The movie is longer than it needs to be and I found I was getting fidgity--wanting it to move on already. Though I always liked to watch Astaire's dancing, I got pretty bored with the dancing done by ""Susan the Silent"". It's not that she's not good, it's just that her dancing leads more towards a ballet type of thing which I'm just not much into and the dances were kind of like the movie in that they seemed to go on forever. I have to admit I hit fast forward a few times. It's worth a look, but maybe as a rental unless you get a really good price on buying it."
3,Really strange musical,"Some of the songs are pretty good (Look to the Rainbow and How are things in Gloca Morra) and it's always nice to hear Petula Clark and watch Fred Astaire do his thing. Tommy Steele's leprechaun is also appealing in an offbeat way. But the film itself is strange as it tries to tell too many stories at once without a cohesive conclusion. The racism angle comes off as really patronizing today, as the Black characters appear unable to help themselves in the film. Incidents and characters come and go without rhyme or reason, and too many songs coming too close behind each other doesn't help either. Overall, an interesting, but uneven effort."
1,Stunning,"When we say stunning- we don't mean it favorably. This movie was pretty difficult to comprehend and even some good actors couldn't make up for a very unusual story line. Fred Astaire's dancing was wasted because it isn't shown and Tommy Steele is the most annoying leprechaun we've ever seen. Petula Clark has a nice voice and does well in her part- it's just pretty ridiculous. This movie really isn't worth buying unless you've seen it before on AMC or something and know this is your type of film. As far as racism goes, this movie made African Americans look silly and the part where the Senator is turned black is absurd. Maybe we don't get this movie but we'd like to ask, ""Is there anything to get?"""
3,Finian's Rainbow,All I can really say about it is it was ok. A 60's movie for sure and if you are really into that kind of movie it wwould be an ok movie. The plot was very week a standard beatup on the establishment type plot.
5,finnians rainbow review,Having recently had the privalidge of seeing and listening to Petula Clarke in concert where she recalled the making of this film. I really had to watch it. It was magnificient to see this lady perform in her younger days although she was one of my favourites in my younger days. I was not aware of what this lady had achieved and I must say that although the years may appear on her birthday cake she really is the same as when she was younger and her voice is as good now as then. She has the same vitality and love of life as she always has had. God bless Petula Clarke.
3,Astaire shines in this movie,There are some good songs here and the incomparable Fred Astaire who still manages to outshine everyone else in the film. There is a cute story here about s pot of gold and a leprechaun but it is Mr. Astaire who steals the show. This was fun!
3,Subdued classical music...,This album sounds like the X-men 2 soundtrack watered down. The Spiderman and even the Daredevil soundtrack are more interesting than the stuff that's on this soundtrack.It definitely isnt' the cool trance music that you hear during the Hulk trailers.
1,Not Impressed,"I have had some nice crystal clear Fireplace DVDs, but this one was poorly recorded and looked blotchy. Not impressed"
4,I like it...It does the job.,"I laughed when I saw it at the store then said - hey what the heck...its $5. After it plays for about 3 minutes the sound and visuals are almost as soothing as the real thing. The DVD does ""loop"" so there is a slight pause sometimes, but again, its $5. Lot cheaper than installing a real fire place. And it beats most of the crap thats on TV today."
1,fireplace. not runnin,"hi there, i`d like to share my review, well, I played the fire impressions in my hd player (xbox 360) but it doesn't work, it seems to be loadin but it gets frezze and i cant make it run it, I bougth another but blueray format and ran it on my ps3 but it doesn't work, i dont know if these tipe of dvds requies another tipe of player but the 2 of them don't work, check them out before buying. [...]"
4,waiting too much for it,well so now we can watch this very good thriller that i saw long time ago in video so it is very good to watch it again and surprise!!!!! a lot of nudity and naked lady is at the program i think it was cut in video before because i was surprising to see what i saw in this dvd so lucio fulci is great and he will always be great in my heart thank you lucio for those fantastic gore movies and good thrillers that you made for us
3,good but......,certain smaller de-solv-it bottles work a little better than this. still this is much better than GOO GONE because it doesnt smell like turpentine.
5,Bruins History DVD,"Sorry, but this was bought as a extended family gift, which is being sent around the country. Right now in Texas, will be going to Pennsylvania, New York, and ultimately to Massachusetts. Sorry, haven't seen it yet."
2,Huge Omissions In Bruins History:,"..Much awaited Bruins History has Dramatic presentation & proper serious tone, but lacks some basic & critical information on key players & Stars, particularly stalwarts of the Late 1950s such as Fleming Mackell, Harry Lumley, Leo Boivin, Larry Regan, Doug Mohns & Don McKenney!! These and several other Bruins from other eras are barely mentioned or completely omitted from the narrative, thus emerges a very incomplete portrait that is both inexcusable and an insult to the proud franchise that is the Boston Bruins...The vaunted UKE Line & pioneer Black player Willie O`Ree are well featured, but the aforementioned lapses make for an incomplete picture..One can only hope for a revised edition...The Boston Bruins story deserves better!"
4,Second to None,"Hi All!This is a special book which has made my wife look more beautiful in all sense. I would love to recommend this book to everyone. This book has been really helpful to people who knows even something about plaiting.Glad to have this review section.Happy braiding, Raghavan.S"
5,All I have to say is Randy Buzzelli !,"No matter how you feel about Cliff Sarde the fact that Randy Buzzelli appears on this album makes it an instant classic. I have followed Randy (or as I call him Big P) for all my life. I thought his career started when he played Joe Cocker in ""Jimi"" but this rare recording is a good 10 years earlier.For the rest of his fans Randy is credited with: Piano, Rhythm Arrangements, Guitar, Drum Programming.As always I looked for signs that the NeedleDBF was involved somehow but none were to be found. Randy must have flown solo on this one."
4,Should give you the chuckles,"Andy Rooney brings that famous dry wit from CBS/60 MINUTES to these pages in this dated but still-funny collection from the late-1970's/early 1980's. Many of his short chapters/essays will put a smile on your face, but a couple are quite somber. Rooney offers his views (and at times his annoyances) on houses, dirty words, D-day, directions, soap, ratings, etc. This is one of several books by this often irreverent, but never irrelevant sage. At this writing, this curmudgeon-of-everyday-things is still going strong in his 90th year."
4,Andy's rants from the 70's,"This is a collection of essays written by Andy Rooney for his spot on 60 Minutes, and his wit and sarcasm convey amazingly well. Reading these essays, I often could hear Andy's voice. Most of these essays were written in the 1970's, and some of them are quite dated. However, most of them stand up to the test of time quite well, and still hit their mark. If you enjoy Mr. Rooney's irreverent sense of humor and biting sarcasm, you should enjoy this collection."
4,A Fun Sampling of the West,"An old women robs a morgue for her outlaw son's body, men trying to kill each other for a copy of a wish catalog, gun slingers in a declining market,....These are just a few of short stories read by George Kennedy and Mr. Kennedy does a great job! I really enjoyed the variety of stories, the humor."
5,"Soothing, luscious, warm, pensive","Sipra Bose, the singer on this CD has a wonderful voice. The style is very traditionally Indian. Track two is a bit sad so I think its about Sita. This would be a great CD with which to meditate or study."
2,"Music is good, but sound is ruthful.","This box contain many great stuff in their only or first version, but I tape some songs from austrian radio in early 90ties and versions which I obtain from radio have much better sound as this sound on original Cd.I hate sound with synthetic echo as follows on this Cd.Maybe better way is obtain this recordings on alternate cds."
4,Trigger point charts,"I purchased this product to have for my massage therapy business. As soon as I get them framed, they will come in handy."
4,So handy,"Thank you for writing this book. It has come in handy to us as we've been on our journey through firsttime pasrenthood. Thank you so much for this resource.Patricia, new mom."
4,Romance in a Sci-Fi Setting,"This is my first foray into the Linden world. I quite enjoyed it, although it reminded me more of a romance than a science fiction novel. The authors imagined a very interesting culture and portray it (mostly) through the eyes of a Terran linguist. However, the focus of the novel was on the emotional bonds between all the characters. If Mercedes Lackey wrote Sci-Fi, this is what it would look like."
2,Boring,I bought this book mostly because one of my favorite authors reviewed it very favorably. Anne McCaffrey basically said she couldn't put it down. I on the other hand could not get more than two pages at a time without nodding off. I eventually made it to chapter 13 and couldn't take it any more.
4,Great insights from two master craftsmen,Reading this book is like sitting in on a fascinating conversation between two great preachers. They cover a wide-ranging set of topics. Anyone interested in preaching will enjoy this book. A special treat included is a CD containing one of Bailey's sermons.
3,From Back Cover,"IT WAS FOR HER OWN GOOD...If he'd thought she would come quietly, security expert Dillon Jones wouldn't have used his ""special"" skills to kidnap her.But the notorious Virginia Johnson was a fighter, and Dillon had the black eye to prove it. He couldn't help wondering how she would act in the throes of passion...how it would be to take her body and soul...His code of honor wouldn't allow it, of course. Not even when she begged him."
5,Hot!!!,This is the sexiest book I've read in a long time. The hero and heroine are so wonderful. I love them!!!!
4,"Concise, but very useful","This is a small dialysis book, but very useful for everyday use. Ideal to be in the pocket of dialysis staff.Antnio Eustaquio Vieira JuniorGoiania GoiasBrazil"
2,Can't install!,I ordered this rod for the finish... and the weight and finish are nice. Unfortunately the seller (Wayfair) or manufacturer (Kingston Brass) neglected to include an of the needed hardware in the package! The end brackets and ceiling suspension shown in the photo were not included and the rod came in a long straight piece and corner piece that are not attached to each other. There isn't any hardware for attaching them! For almost $200 I expected a complete product!
5,Hardcore Perfection,"This CD is excellent with nearly every track being pure musical perfection. The second bonus CD is continuously mixed and shows how the Warp Brothers have truly mastered the hardcore mix from their first attempt found on Vol. 6 of the 'Tranzworld' mix series.The only downside to this double CD is that while very similar, the first CD is missing three tracks from the original 'Warp Factor' CD. I actually had to buy both 'Warp 10' and 'Warp Factor' and I'm glad I did, two of the missing tracks are absolutely wonderful! In any case, the Warp Brothers are masters of hardcore and have rapidly become my favorite techno artist over Mauro Picotto and Voodoo & Serano."
3,Wafer protein bar??,"This is a wafer bar first and protein bar VERY much second. Not a good bar for athletes or gym rats. The flavor is not bad, and if you really like wafer bars, then this might be okay for you. In general though, the concept gets really old really fast and I am not enjoying trying to get through the whole box."
4,Power crunch,"This is a tasty product, not too sweet. Crispy wafers provide the perfect amount of crunch."
5,Protein bar with no nuts,"I love this bar. I am allergic to all nuts, so this is one of the few protein bars that I can eat. Plus it tastes great and doesn't cause an energy crash later."
2,Didn't care for the taste,"I didn't really care for the taste of this bar. Kind of dry and powdery between the wafers, and the taste of the sucralose kind of sticks out to me. Also doesn't have any added vitamins or minerals, which I like to have in my protein/energy bars. I love the taste of vanilla, but these bars just weren't for me."
5,a MUST-HAVE for all artists,"This is the most classical,most essential anatomy book for artists that has ever been created.And yet nobody can compete with BAMMES.If you have that book feel secure-you have the tools-practice is the rest."
4,Great info for cat lovers who think cats can't be groomed!,"Although I haven't extensively read this book, a copy was shown to me by a cat breeder. I looked up areas that I know are problems for cat owners. My business is grooming cats, and clients always ask the same questions; this book uses many of the techniques that I have used in 9 yrs of grooming cats. nice pictures, too!"
2,Obviously not a cat person,"I was extremely disappointed when I got this book, especially considering all the high marks from groomers it received. The drawings (no photo references) are generally pointless and unprofessional. The grooming information is weak and the handling info is basically non-existent. From the viewpoint of a cat lover/owner and cat rescue volunteer, the author should stick to dogs. Unfortunately, this appears to be the only cat grooming guide available at the moment. However, I suggest looking into some good cat behavior books (such as ""The cat who cried for help"" by Dr. Nicholas Dodman (he also wrote a wonderful book on canine behavior, ""The dog who loved too much"") or ""PetSpeak: Share Your Pet's Secret Language"" by the editors of Pets) to help with cat handling. Whether you're a pet owner or professional groomer, knowing how the cat is going to react is vital for your's and the cat's safety."
2,If You want to learn to groom cats - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"I've been a professional certified groomer for 5+ years now, and when I was first learning to groom cats I thought I'd buy a grooming guide for quick reference in case I needed it. Well this book is pretty much a joke. The information in it is useless, the pictures of the cats are odd looking, and it does not cover the various handling techniques you need to groom a cat. Do yourself a favor and save your money."
1,Great Talent Atrociously Produced CD,"The problem with this cd has nothing to do with the artist or musicians but all to do with the sound reproduction. Sounds like the bass player didn't turn up for the show! On 'Please come home to Boston' you cannot hear the vocals properly. Someone is dueting with Glen and the sound on this one is particularly bad. Glen, you are great but whoever is responsible for this cd production wise should be hung out to dry!"
4,Glen Campbell's Greatest Hits,This album was like meeting an old friend you hadn't seen in years. It brought back many memories. I had forgotten just how good this man is both playing and singing some great songs. It made me remember individual albums and think about replacing each of them. These are more of the songs I grew up with and they are as good today as they were then.
5,an amazing sel-reflexive novel by a great writer,"This novel is a good example of fiction writing that has been taken to another level. Or a number of levels! As you read the novel, you not only get to know the young protagonist, but also the protagonist's protagonists (confused yet?), as his the characters that he writes about in his own novel literally come to life. This coupled with visits from characters in ancient Irish folklore make this story extremely entertaining and great food for thought. It's always refreshing read a work of fiction which challenges and entertains."
1,The chain broke within hours of wearing it,"I just received it today and wore it for the first time. Cute necklace, but as I was sitting in class, I felt the pearl fall down my shirt and realized the chain had spontaneously broken near the clasp. A bit disappointed - it was a pretty necklace. I'll be returning it."
4,"Comment on ""Inventing the Abbotts""","I like the movie because Liv Tyler and Joaquin appear to be such innocent teenage lovers in the film. Billy's character seems not to be satisfied with everything surrounding him. It seems the fate is not fair to him and he envies everything the rich Abbots possess. Besides, I also like the loving mom of the two brothers very much. She is so virtuous and patient with them. Overall it is a very interesting story."
4,About the Abbotts,"This film is solidly in the ""coming of age"" genre for both sexes. I liked it when I first saw it because it has sensibility and an honest ending. The acting is solid but can be over-the-top in spots. The story line saves it from being too hammed up."
3,Love Jennifer Connelly!,About the best thing about this movie is the gorgeous Ms. Connelly. Her scene where she teases Joaquim Phoenix with her upskirt panty shots in the high school library is the highlight of the whole movie. Her topless scene right before that is good too. Pound that pause button!
4,It was not bad.,I liked it. Very emotional. I love Joaquin and I do think Jennifer is a great actress. Very great look at life in that era.
4,The music in Inventing the Abbotts,"Does anyone know who sang the song during the last credits? It was not on the soundtrack, was a woman, and the song was really pretty. It's not mentioned anywhere...."
5,Real life,"I bought this because of Liv Tyler and Jennifer Connelly, and ended up liking the movie more than I thought I would."
1,Not so wrangler carpenter jeans,"My first purchase from amazon because of a gift certificate I was given. I brought the wrangler jeans for quite a bit more I can buy the same brand at Target.. The quality was less than that of Target too. Material was thinner, the zipper feels like it's going to break everytime I use it. So I'm not very happy with my purchase to say the least... It makes wary of order anything from Amazon.. I still have 73.oo or so left on my card. I'm looking for some tennis shoes but wonder if I'm going to pay more and get less in quaility.. Disappointed and not recommending Amazon even telling people of my experience.. :-( my usual wrangler have lasted quite a long time. So well see how long they last..."
4,It's short and sweet.,"Firefly was an amazing show, and the music for it was just incredible. Imagine my excitement when I found out they were finally releasing the soundtrack. It contains all of the major themes to be found in the show, plus passages that remind the listener of certain scenes, characters, and events that happened within the Firefly universe. My only gripe with the CD, besides lacking ""The Hero of Canton,"" is that the tracks are too short - only two are longer than three minutes. It's difficult to get into the music when the track barely touches upon one theme before moving onto the next. Probably would have been better as a longer, double disc set, in my opinion. Otherwise, the music is fantastic."
4,Interesting music from a great show,The show was before its time and the music is very much today with something for everyone. Much of it is haunting melodies. Enjoy
5,Thanks Greg,"for making the ""verse"" a complete experience. Sometimes raucous, sometime tragic, sometimes achingly beautiful, your music transports."
3,"Good music, but best within the show.","This is a good soundtrack, but it is probably best appreciated by fans of the show. The music is very well done, but it doesn't always stand on its own as well as it did in the context of the show.. It is by no means bad music, it's just not something that I would regularly throw in for casual listening. There are some very strong pieces, and fit perfectly within the show itself. The show itself gets my unconditional recommendation, however."
3,Good but not enough stuff,"The same problem as the Firefly series has. There is not enough here. I am a big fan of Jo Loduca's Hercules and Xena soundtracks. Since those series went on for many seasons there is a lot of music available for those soundtracks and only the best music made it to the first few. There is not enough good music in the dozen plus Firefly shows to make this a great soundtrack, instead it feels like we get most of the show's music regardless to whether it is worth putting on a soundtrack album or not. Some good tracks but a lot of dull ones too."
3,Great show! One of the best to be on TV.,"Why did Fox cancel this? That network sucks for more reasons than they're biased propoganda ""news"" channel.This sound track is ok, I wish it had the folk song for Jayne. I bought it for the title song. It doesn't have the end credits music or an extended version of the main title. Hence the 3 stars."
4,"Good for every fan of the show, and many lovers of music","This soundtrack has captured moments that harken to specific moments in a short-lived and extremely good series. It speaks well of the composer and musicians.One obvious hole in the soundtrack is the famous 'Ballad of Jayne' - which perhaps was not composed by Edmondson but was wonderful in the episode ""Jaynestown"" and would have been great to hear all the words to as a song in-and-of-itself.The soundtrack is also good as an album in its own right. I am at some points reminded of Bella Fleck and other successful newage blendings of different music forms. In this case it is the western, bluegrass, Celtic folktune, and Asian put together."
2,Firefly Soundtrack,"I am a huge fan of Firefly and couldn't wait to receive the soundtrack. While the snippets of music brought back memories of the show, they were too short and fragmented to be appreciated on their own. I loved the theme song, but would rather down load this from another source and save the cost of the CD. Sorry, guys."
1,Don't buy this if you're looking for firefly music,"This is just a collection of scene themes from the series Firefly. I'm a huge fan of the show but thought I was buying full length songs or music. Dont' get me wrong, the music is good, just not what you're expecting believe me."
1,Firefly TV soundtrack,"I enjoyed this style music quite alot. I am a fan of the show, and hearing it there led me to purchase the CD. There is a small draw back in that the music pieces are very short. I would have liked 2 CDs with longer cuts....but Great Stuff!"
4,If you love the show....,"If you love the show Firefly, this soundtrack is for you. You'll be flooded with memories from your favorite episodes, and left remembering all the ""short-lived"" good times. This soundtrack is a must for any Firefly fan."
5,"A great, but very short lived TV series","Firefly was a great, though short lived TV show. The music was also very good. Since I own the Firefly DVD series and Serenity, I also bought this, the Firefly soundtrack. The music makes me think of parts of the show and is fun to listen to. I also bought the Serenity Soundtrack."
5,Easy on the ears,"It's easy to get lost on the music and let your mind wander. I just wish the tracks were longer. Many were only 1,2, or occasionally 3 minutes. But despite this the music seems to go on and on and on."
5,"Loved the series, Love the Music","If you loved the series, you will love the music. The music fits the show perfectly, but I should mention, a lot of these tracks are short and may not stand on their own for someone who has never seen the series. So...see the show and love the music."
5,Firefly is the best small time t.v. sound track,"This CD is the best 'small time' t.v. sound track. No big sound or spectacular songs, but the music moves you back to the time of the Old Wild West meets new Country Western."
1,not what I thougth I ordered,"For starters, this shirt is not a lighter, royal blue like it is pictured....it is a very dark, navy blue. Very dark. Also, the sizes run big. Every t-shirt i own is a size Large.....this shirt is a size large, but is WAY too big. Be warned."
4,Wonderful Collection,"The Handbook of Heartbreak has a wonderful collection of poems. Some very touching and personal ones. I related very well to some of the poetry included in this collection- a very nice piece to read over some free time, but I think it would have been even more wonderful if it had a few more pieces of poetry in it."
4,Wonderful Product,"This product fully replace OneNote from Microsoft it is great easy to use, and have great features, I recommend upgrade to version 3.0 to give me voice note feature."
4,4.5 star - 5th solo effort from Eiht,"Eiht's second album on Hoo Bangin is another good one. The only problem with it is there's only 11 songs, but it's a good cd all Eiht fans need to get a copy. It has 1 classic, 2 ok songs and the other 9 are all good. Production is good and is handled by Young Tre (5 songs), Eiht & Caviar (2 songs each), and DJ Slip, and Binky MAck each do 1 song. Guests are a little more then he usually ahs on his albums. If only he got the airplay he deserves at least on the east coast (couldn't say for the west -much like Spice 1 or DJ Quik and many other Cali rappers) he'd have at least 10 million solo records sold and a bunch of platinum plaques.#2 - 8.5 (f/ Techniec)#3 - 9 (f/ mack 10 & techniec)#4 - 8#5 - 8.5 (f/ mack 10)#6 - 8 (f/ soultre)#7 - 9#8 - 9.5 (f/ binky mack)#9 - 8.5#10 - 7 (has a rock beat to it)#11 - 7#12 - 10 (classic)b.

5,Powerful Images from India !,"A visual reference of museum quality for researchers, or just people interested in this country.This book accompanies an exhibition of photography collection of India for the period 1840-1911. These images are produced more than hundred years ago, during the early ages after photography was invented. Indian and foreigner found photography as magic, when using their camera to capture the surrounding environment to image. It covers powerful images about landscapes, people, architecture, etc from India."
5,A novel that explores both margin and center.,"""Dele's Child"" should be read by everyone. It is an outstanding study of how, in a very curious way, an encounter in Africa becomes a transforming agent for three people: One, an Italian doctor, a second, an indigenous African and somewhat crooked politician, and a third, Dele, termed a ""saintly whore,"" Who, the novel asks, best deserves to inherit the future"
5,meditation: path to the deepest self,"There's nothing pedagogic or mystifying about this book. Its wonderful gift is to unfold, carefully and delicately, an approach to meditation that can enrich and deepen our everyday lives, that can help us to understand ourselves and our relationships to others and to the wider world.This is no woolly self-help book. It is written with rigour, wit and - above all - with generosity, love and compassion. It's inspirational and at the same time a great read."
5,A must have for the beginner in meditation.,This book is excellent for someone starting out with meditation. It is an inspiring book that offers realistic help to the reader in order to guide them onto the track of meditation. The full color images and detail descriptions breaks down the very essence of meditation by offering a comprehensible and uncomplicated form of writing to address the benefits of the mediation practice. It clarifies how mediation is a great technique that will lead you on a path to greater spiritual awareness and enlightenment. I would recommend this book for any meditation instructor seeking a book on meditation to provide to their beginner students.
2,got the wrong edition,"I needed the student edition, but received the teachers edition. When I ordered, It did not tell me that this was a teachers edition."
1,Poor service and zero communication,"This provider never sent my item and never responded to the 4 emails I sent inquiring about a delivery date. The book was needed for a class and as a result of waiting the 3 week delivery window it created much dismay on our end. I would not suggest using this vendor as they did not respond to even the most courteous of inquiries and clearly have no regard for their customers. I hope that Amazaon will help resolve the charges on our credit account before we are forced to dispute them. In a nutshell the transaction was a huge dissapointment. If there was less than one star to assign to the rating I would have, however they do not allow a zero star rating."
4,About as good as it gets...,"For American History textbooks today, this one is about as good as it gets. It is not perfect, mind you, but as a veteran history teacher, I can tell you that I have come across a good number of textbooks with glaring factual errors (the AGS World Geography and American Government books come to mind). This one has no obvious factual errors.I have discovered that one of the best indicators of a good social studies textbook is how economics is covered. This one gives a fair and logical coverage to economics topics. There are no glowing references to Che Guevara, so its one step in the right direction right there."
2,Too much information!,"My son's middle school is using this textbook. Though the authors have gone to a lot of trouble to provide pictures of the people and places they discuss, and though there are some compelling quotations and stories which COULD interest middle-school aged children, the text has entirely too much information. The authors attempt too much. This would be a good text for someone preparing to TEACH middle school, from which they could glean good information, but it is overwhelming to the student unless the teacher can focus and subordinate well. In our son's case, the textbook became a handicap rather than a help."
1,man get the first one it's way better,I love west coast rap but this seconsd cd from the comrads was straight weakl even mack 10 and snoop dogg can't save this from being a disaster.
5,Fun and quick game of luck,My 5 yr. old and I play this game often. It is a one person game but we just take turns and play it together. It is a game that takes about 2 minutes to play but is quite fun and can be addicting.
4,King Dinosaur and The Jungle DVD,"This is a very nice Double Feature 50's Sci-Fi DVD,and for a good price too.The picture quality is good and there are enough bonus features to make fans of these movies very happy.This DVD is a great addition to my 50's Sci-Fi collection.I'd love to see more like these.If you like movies like this I think you will really enjoy this DVD.I know I did."
3,as expected,"King dinosaur is one of those typical movies of its time. The story line is barely believable. The acting is sort of melodramatic. And the dinosaurs are lizards blown up to large size. But if you are buying this kind of movie then you already expect that. This movie is not great, but it is not terrible either. I bought it to add to large collection i already have. it is a simple entertainment that is typical of the time it was made. There is not alot of blood,cursing, or nudity that todays movies depend on to sell tickets."
1,Was sent wrong size puppet,Was sent a much smaller squirrel puppet. The one received was about 5 inches tall. Not like the one pictured or on description.
5,Daugher loves this puppet.,"My 10 yr. old daughter loves this puppet. She originally saw it at a bookstore and kept asking for it. So, we looked it up on Amazon and, of course, got it for a better price. She takes this puppet with her everywhere and can often be found heading out to the garage to retrieve it from the van before bedtime."
3,Bulky,"Decent sound quality but the earphone is rather large, bulky and cumbersome. Difficult to adjust around and in ear. Not very comfortable."
2,Gibson & Camp -- Not At Their Best,"This is not a great recording -- but if you should ever hear the original ""Gibson & Camp At The Gate of Horn"" (c., 1961 on Elektra Records), you will discover an absolute treasure. ""Revisited"" tries to capture Gibson & Camp in that historic '60's performance, (virtually every song is contained on the original release), and falls flat on its face. The original Elecktra recording is due to be re-issued soon. Save your money for the real thing and catch these two folk artists at their absolute best."
4,"Gentle, relaxing yoga","I have only done the evening/relaxing segment of this video, but I have done it many times. It's very soothing, and on the nights I do it, I definitely sleep better. If this is what you're looking for in a yoga video, this one's for you!"
5,i really loved this yoga dvd,"i've tried yoga tapes before, i have a limited attention span and had problems keeping focused without laughing to the yoga talk. i'm so glad i took a chance by the other reviews cause this workout was the best one i've had so far and can't wait until i can fit it in my schedule again. simple yet effective and i definatly felt stretched relaxed and centered. Sara was a wonderful instructor she used common speak for the most part and did explain things like breathing and position very well she also encourage just to laugh and do your best. i highly recomend this DVD to supplement and add yoga to an exercise plan."
5,relaxing and calming,This is the first Yoga video I have gotten and it is also the first time I have done Yoga. For a beginner it is quite easy and very relaxing. Ms. Ivanhoe has a peacful calming voice and the music is wonderful. When you close your eyes the music just soothes you. Very happy with getting this DVD and learning Yoga.
5,Awesome Bedtime Routine!,"This will actually be my 3rd time buying this video becuz I use it so much, and maybe a little because I have a million kids who are prone to destroying dvds. The first one I bought was on VHS though before I even had kids! I've loved it since it first came out. It's a great video to help unwind, relax, and soothe your aching body and mind. Every so often I get an insomnia spell, especially when life is stressful, and this video worked like a charm for me every time. Better than any sleeping pill or melatonin or anything else I've tried. If you're looking for a bedtime routine, especially in stressful times, I definitely recommend giving this one a try!"
5,relaxing,This routine is very relaxing & very well worth it. It is one of those that you feel refreshed after doing & will still feel the benefits later on in the day.
5,Great complement to GSP Rushfit workout,Enjoyed over other yoga workouts and very useful to stretching out after harder workouts...the lady in the purple outfit is HOT!!!
3,Okay if you do not have back issues,"I know all back issues are different, so I cannot recommend or not recommend this for others to use. I know what my issues are, follow instructions from my doctor pertaining to my limitations and guidelines that I am to follow. There were several poses that I could not do, or caused further, painful, aggravation of my injuries that I was not told would cause a problem. Just be very careful. One of the poses on the floor I had to come out of and just roll onto my side for several minutes until I could move again. I have done other yoga videos and not had any issues. It's not a bad video by any means, just not for me. My advise is to ""be careful"", from my back to yours. :)"
2,This really amounts to light stretching,"This is a good video if you want a light stretching routine. If you are looking for something more rigorous, look elsewhere!"
4,Very Relaxing,I wanted a quickie yoga video to do at the end of the day and this is perfect. I'm a beginner/intermediate student and I appreciated the modifications for some of the poses. It's a great way to unwind after a busy day!
5,One of my favorites,"I consider myself an advanced beginner. This is a great relaxing yoga video. I think it's intended for bed time but I like doing it in the morning before work or just to get moving when I don't have the energy to sweat. It's fairly gentle so good for beginners, but you can always go deeper into a pose or adjust as needed to challenge you if you're more advanced.There are a couple really simple and gentle vinyasas. Just enough to make you feel warm inside. You could do most of the video with your eyes closed, the hostess narrates pretty well, if not a little too slowly. Plenty of instruction for beginners. Not too much upper body work- more legs, and hips. Maybe one or 2 shoulder stretches. Lots of reminders to breathe."
4,Good Stretching Video,"This video features a kinder, gentler yoga- lots of slow stretches that feel great at the end of the day. The instructor gives clear instructions and the music is lovely and unintrusive. I don't count this as an actual workout- there is nothing strenous in this video, but it helps to get out the ""kinks"" and eliminates back pain due to tight muscles. This video leaves me feeling so relaxed, that I usually do this before bedtime. Overall, a good addition to your video library."
4,Crunch - Candlelight Yoga,"Good for the beginner to interm. yoga student. I personally like Sara Ivanhoe and her style of yoga. I bought this to update another one of her tapes/DVD's. She has a very down to earth approach, which helps you to just go with the process."
3,OK but certainly nothing special,"I am not sure why this received such rave reviews. Like some people mentioned she has all these candles lit but the lights are so bright. I thought it would not be so bright. There are too many people in the class. I think there are 8 or 10 people. I guess it bothers me because I did not think the video would be like a class and I have been watching too many estecically beautiful Gaiam yoga DVDs.The yoga itself is way, way to simple for me and I have just started practicing in November. Even for a de-stress evening yoga routine I have to modify the yoga so I feel something.Lucily I only Netflixed this one as it got such rave reviews I was going to buy before Netflixing it."
2,Not worth your money or time,"The DVD description and the reviews all sounded great in principle but in reality, the DVD was a total letdown. The yoga exercises did not flow well and hardly amounted to much stretching or relaxing. The quality of the production was unimpressive in a brightly lit, crowded studio. In place of this, I would recommend Rainbeau Mars series of yoga DVDs (ranging from beginner to more advanced). The quality of production is much better and the choreography and explanation of moves are much clearer and more logical."
3,Not too strenuous,"This is a fairly easy beginner level yoga routine designed to help you relax and unwind. It does the trick. Like other reviewers here, it's not my absolute favourite though. My best ""comfort"" yoga dvd is Rod Stryker's ""Yoga for Longevity"". I do that one much more often than Candlelight Yoga. I have others I like more too. I agree with the reviewer who said Candlelight Yoga is a bit overrated. But if you like variety, it's always nice to have another yoga dvd or video to add to your collection which I guess could include this dvd. It doesn't make my list of Top 10. But maybe Top 50. I recommend Yoga for Longevity instead."
3,"Relaxing, but boring....and too chatty","This feels like an instructional video with all of the chatter. While it was nice to give tips on proper form, she went into more details than that. I fast forwarded through the first 4 minutes or so.It is also best done with eyes shut. The cold, classroom environment really took away from the video.The music is very relaxing, and the poses are as well. But for me, I was bored. If I had known it had an instructional feel to it, I would not have purchased it. Relaxing doesn't have to equal dull."
4,Relaxing,This tape is just what I need after a long day of sitting in front of a computer. The session is relaxing and you get a nice stretch that takes out all of the kinks you get throughout the day.The bonus session is a plus and nice to do when you only have a little bit of time to get a session in.
4,Love the Bonus Exercise,"I love this workout just for the bonus workout (15 min). With a two-year old, I don't have time for workouts that take longer than 30-or-so minutes (why are almost all yoga videos sooooo long?). And as an added bonus, there are NO downward dogs in the bonus workout (very difficult for me). The regular workout is good, too, although, I've only done it once. I just keep popping it in for the bonus workout. Great way to feel like you've accomplished something without snatching away your whole morning."
5,Great for Beginners,"I am 53 years old with a little arthritis starting along the spine and my chiropractor and I felt some gentle yoga would help to strength and return more flexibility to my spine. Candlelight Yoga is just great! Sara Ivanhoe encourages me to go as far as I am capable of and I never feel like I am ""failing."" I would recommend this for beginners and to anyone who wants to sample Yoga for its relaxation and body health benefits."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this dvd thinking that it would be very relaxing before bedtime. I also own the Crunch - The Perfect Yoga Workout dvd, which I really like a lot.I was extremely disappointed in Candlelight Yoga, mainly because all they did was take a section of The Perfect Yoga Workout and put it on a dvd and call it Candlelight Yoga.For a relaxing workout, buy Crunch-The Perfect Yoga Workout. You will get much better results and wake up feeling very relaxed and refreshed."
5,Excellent! So Relaxing!,"I love this DVD! I've been watching it on Netflix for several months. I've watched many other yoga DVDs, but this is my favorite. It is so relaxing, and I feel centered and calm at the end. I highly recommend it! It's not a workout, you won't sweat, but it is amazing for bringing awareness to the body and the present moment. If you're looking for something relaxing and meditative while stretching your body, this is the DVD for you!"
3,A bit disappointing,"I just bought this and received it in the mail today. Roger Whittaker is one of the great performers so I was anticipating a full concert with surround, stereo sound. Instead of that, the tracks were a compilation of live songs taken it seemed, from various concerts. The sound recording was rather poor because it seemed to lack dimension or depth, even sounding tinny at times. I kept checking my stereo speakers to make sure they were both working and they were.Sorry to say, I cannot recommend this cd but I do recommend Roger Whittaker."
5,Simply Galland,Galland's primary account of his Luftwaffe service and the air war in Europe. A quick read with interesting facts. Primarily Galland points out his frustration with the High Command to listen to the changes which which may have turned the tide in the air over the Reich. A must read for anyone interested in German Aces.
3,An airwar classic but a rather dry reading experience,"Germany's General of Fighters recounts the rise and fall of the Luftwaffe. Despite itsautobiographical flavour, Galland seems to fade into the background of the wider context ofGermany's airwar. Similar in scope and approach to Johnny Johnson's ""Wing Leader"", ""The Firstand the Last"" holds more value as a reference book than as a particularly fun read. Be sure to read more reviews at the""WWII Aviation Booklist"" http://www.ampsc.com/~prophet/booklist.html"
2,THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS,"Instead of buying this book by US$ 33, stick to "" WING LEADER "", by Johnnie Johnson, by US$ 10. It's much better. Galland's book is confusing and he clearly intends to take off his shoulders any blame for the Luftwaffe failure in WW II."
2,Average,"Galland passed away in 1996, so he deserves the best memories. But this book us a typical product of late-war Germany. The book is very widespread, seldom focusing clearly in any given subject. As for air combats, they are very few. Galland also shows that he wants no blame for himself, accusing Hitler abou the ME 262 productiond elay. The ME 262 was never in action in great numbers simply because his development was very difficult ( new technologies ) and the raw material to produce it were finished."
4,A Good Account of II World War Leader,"This is the handwritten tale of the own experiences achieved by fighter pilot and later Air General Adolf Galland. That is what the book is, nor more, nor less. The account of his life during WWII written only 9 years after its conclusion. Although it might be a little bit boring through some passages it is a good book to have in your WWII Library!!!"
3,WW2 Books,"As an ex RAF type I found the book interesting. It did leave a sour taste in my mouth when he complained about us killing children in bombing raids. It apparantly did not occur to him that he was supporting a regime that killed millions of peaple including children, old people, etc."
3,Seems to have lost its greatness,"Another book I read in the sixties. Whether it has been edited or re-written, it certainly does not have the impact I remember. Galland had a remarkable career and, whilst this edition certainly highlights the problems the Luftwaffe experienced in getting its priorities straight, both in terms of production and strategy as well as politics, there is a lack of combat commentary. Here was a man who flew in the Spanish Civil War where the Lufwaffe set its tactics, through the Battles of Poland, France and Britain before being promoted beyond flying to one of the most senior positions in his Service, but there is little detail of any of these experiences. Pity. Galland actually became the first commander of the new Luftwaffe after the war, is recognised as erudite, intelligent and an excellent reference for many things both during and after the conflict, but somehow this book does not reflect those characteristics."
3,The First and the Last,"The book loses something in the translation I think, but otherwise is an honest non-political review of the sucesses and failures of the Luftwaffe and the poor decisions made by the German High Command."
3,Yawn...,"I cant remember a single episode from this book. nothing happened...no dog fights, hardly any action. So he hated Goering, big deal...let me reccomend ""the blonde knight, erich hartman"", for a much more intresting, german perspective fighter pilot story."
4,"Perfect Book Status, Perfect Delivering but....",But the papercover that usually protects the hardcover of the book has not been received. Is this normal? Is there any possibility to get it??Please let me know as sson as possible.Thank you in advance.
1,Only half the book it purports to be,"The First and the Last is a superlative book. The edition on offer here, care of Buccaneer Books, Cutchogue, NY is not. The first seven chapters have been dumped, all the maps and charts are missing and the majority of the original photographic illustrations have been omitted or replaced with different images. I can't say whether these were used in later editions - they are certainly not in my Methuen & Co 1955 edition. Aside from the back of his head there no longer remains a single image of the man himself! All photo reproductions are poor.On the positive side I didn't waste much money on this copy. Give it a miss!"
3,colorforms,Finding wiggle toys is a huge challenge anymore and my 4 year old is crazy about them. I was thrilled to find this one he didn't have and at a reasonable price. Delivery was faster than I expected.
5,"My favorite ""Nora"" book!","Nora finds a little duck in the woods and takes it to her friend, DR.John, a retired doctor who now runs an animal sancuary. Dr. John tells her that the duck will be fine after a little rest. He then takes Nora on a tour of the grounds and introduces her to other animals that have come to be in his care. Later in the afternoon they check on Nora's duck and sure enough it is better. Nora introduces the duck to Dr. John's other guests before returning it to the pond where it rejoins its mother and siblings. This is the most heart-warming of the Nora books and the fact that there really IS a Dr. John makes the story that much more special! The book is out-of-print now but it is well worth an o.p. book search to add this gem to your Nora collection."
5,Worth adding to your collection!,"I realize some people will settle for nothing less than fully restored with true anamorphic widescreen.I am very satisfied having this set.......Clambake is not as good as far as picture quality as the other 3 movies, but still watchable.This set brought me closer to having a complete Elvis movie collection. I think I am still 3 movies short.Overall this set is just fine, so don't be too swayed by some of the reviews.We as consumers can only buy what is available and this is it.So yes I would definitely recommend this set.Their are no more Elvis movies coming out so get these while you can.Also the price is very good for a 4 movie set."
2,Upset,"2 of the movies very bad quality, don't recommend buying, first time not happy with amazon item.Clambake and follow that dream were terrible could barely see them on tv."
3,the boxset,"All these movies are available in widescreen, so I don't know what the previous reviewer is complaining about. Yes, Clambake is one of the worst, but Follow That Dream and Kid Galahad are quite good. And Frankie and Johnny is an interesting concept and not bad.The only movie not available on DVD is Elvis on Tour, though it was available on laser. Come on MGM, where is it???"
1,The worst of Elvis.....all in one recycled boxed set!,"Even the most dedicated Elvis fan will admit that the king made some pretty rotten movies, and 2 of his worst are here CLAMBAKE and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY, along with the (at best) mediocre FOLLOW THAT DREAM and KID GALAHAD.Elvis may have been an ""MGM MOVIE LEGEND"" as the box infers, but none of his ""MGM"" movies are anywhere to be found in this set...they're UNITED ARTISTS movies. Why? Because ""MGM"" is merely a name affixed to a company that doesn't own the great old MGM library...Warner Brothers owns those films...so if you're looking for the best of Elvis at MGM (like JAILHOUSE ROCK, WORLD'S FAIR, VIVA VEGAS, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS) look elsewhere.If you are an Elvis completist and don't mind spending your money on this ill-conceived collection, have at it!"
2,Nothing I have tried is that good.,"I have tried several recipes in this book, but overall the results range from ""so-so"" to awful. The set up of the book is nice in the fact that they take Holidays thru out the year and have the recipes associated with a suggested menu for that occasion. That is why I gave it a 2. I love cookbooks and there are dozens out there that have much better recipes. Try them instead."
4,Pretty helpful little critters!,"I have been up and down over Post-Its over time, but I've come to conclude that this is a pretty helpful product.There are a lot of occasions when I need to make a quick note for my future reference, and affixing said note to a document helps provide a reminder for me. Hence, Post-It notes make my life a bit easier.I even like the different colors. Adds a kind of comfort level and the bright colors add a somewhat cheery note.So, after years of seeing these as little more than kitsch, I have come to appreciate that these pop-up notes actually make my life a wee bit easier."
2,Too much fat,"I received this book, but feel that the receipes are very high in fat to be rated a low fat cookbook. Sorry"
4,"1,001 Ways to Indulge","1,001 Low-fat Desserts gives you more than enough delicious dessert ideas to cater to any occasion, wether it be a snack or something that will really impress the church choirs annual Christmas party. It not only gives you ideas for tantalizing the taste buds it gives detailed, per serving, nutritional information for each dessert. With a breakdown of calories, fat count and what food group exchange each serving counts as, this book gives enough information for the most serious of healthy eaters. My sweet tooth was particularly fond of the variety offered in Section 3 ""Cheese Cakes"". Don't stop there though, towards the end of the book there are several fantastic ideas on ""Quick Desserts"". I believe that 1,001 Low-Fat Desserts is the perfect addition to any kitchens counter space, dieting or not."
5,Great Dora story,"I got this for my 3-yr-old niece who is a Dora fanatic. She wore out her original copy of the DVD, but she is about to become a big sister, so I thought it was appropriate. This is one of her favorites."
2,Never again...,"I was not really happy with this product...the case was in horrible condition, which was the least of my worries because the disk was filthy!!! Finger prints and smudges all over the place..."
1,Dora?Stop you're annoying,"Here are the Pros: Dora Shows some spanish learning, and is original other than most kids shows. But that's all. I think that Dora should really start speaking sentences in Spanish, so your childs spanish makes sense. Dora also has cons because throughout the shows and movies, it seems like Dora's a game and a kid is clicking and clicking."
5,this video is sooooo goood,hi this video is excelent my sister loves it but we like other kidsongs videos like verry sily songs well let me tell you about kidsongs ride the roller coster i cant belive this the kidsongs kids go to the theme park and some show scarry rides like that water ride vopits this video shows lots of watertastic games rides and songs my sister vanesa hoolet and a famoly friends mom has this video once we find out they have kidsongs videos beg our parents to go there of course say hello first then race to the tv whenever we see someone who would like to say hello to us we stop the video and say hello godda love the kidsongs christian os if you know anyone who dosent have this video jump in the car go to wall mart target or toys r us barns and nobble and get this video im telling ya your kids will love this video theyl love it so much theyd wana hear it again my sister actactly did
2,Be Aware,Ok so I grew up on Kids Songs so I thought it would be cool to get them for my kids. Why not try Amazon I said but unfortunately I chose the wrong seller ! This video looks like it once belonged to Block Buster ! Its all scratched up and used and sometimes refuses to work ! All of the other videos I ordered were new! this was my only used purchase and I regret wasting my money !
2,Difficult to clean,"OK we used it a lot because I had it but it is so difficult to clean after using. I used a toothpick to get the pieces out of it after each use, and if you dont, they dry in every small corner in it and you cant use it well the next time.I think I wasted my money on it because who has the time to clean it everyday with a toddler in the house!"
5,5 year old loved it,I got this for my nephew for Christmas. I wasn't there when he opened it but from what I understand he loves it.
1,Playdoh Mess,This toy is a nightmare to use. Doh gets stuck deep inside with no way to easily clean it. I spent most of the time trying to clean it out rather then playing with my son.
4,Good PlayDoh toy,"My 3-yr old likes playing with this PlayDoh toy. She can stuff the play-doh in the pump mechanism and can usually pump it out herself. The only problem is that the play-doh gets stuck in the cracks and it's really hard to get out. Then it gets crusty and you have to chip it out. For the price, it's a great value. The attachments offer lots of options to squeeze the PlayDoh out with. It's a fun toy overall."
5,It turns out the Play-Doh fun factory does actually manufacture fun,"My two kidlets (ages 3 years and 19 months) both love Play-Doh and they especially fight over the ""dat squish pway-dow fing."" So if you have two kids who struggle with concepts like sharing, or not hitting their sibling over the head for failing to share, then buy two of these."
4,Same as 20 years ago...,This was a favorite for me as a kid. My 2yr old loves it too. Just wish the play-doh didn't get stuck in the corners. Makes for messy clean up.
4,"Toddler loves it, but needs help to play with.","My almost 2 year old loved this toy from out of the box, but def. needs a parent to help play with it. even I had trouble pushing the 'spaghetti' out of the toy so you could only imagine! adds imagination to the possibilities of playing with doh, but it sure makes it messier... little bits of doh everywhere and all over the toy in the cracks and pieces... def. needs cleaning up... I keep a hair pic with the play toy bag now to help 'poke' out the doh in all the crevices... makes it livable. would buy again!"
4,great fun,"Great little toy - santa brought it to our house on special request. Two years later it is stil a fun toy and nothing has broken. I was a little concerned the plastic arm or shape plates would break with hard use, but they haven't."
5,Perfect,"This was bought for my 2 and a half year old son and he thinks it is the best thing in the world. He wants to play with it for hours and it fully captures his full attention and imagination. I will agree with some reviewers that it it can be a bit hard to press, but that is only for some of the shapes. As long as you stick with the open shapes such as the spirals, leafs, stars and so on and stay away from the noodles your little one should have no issues. It is easy enough to clean and it all snaps together for easy storage. The play knife is stored under the handle and is very secure there, I did not even notice it till an hour into play the first time around.I would highly recommend this to any other parent, in fact I am getting another for my son's grandparents to have."
3,Great book if you're just starting your dog library,"I bought this book because I'm looking for a small dog and was excited about the great reviews it received. And don't get me wrong, this is a good book. It just seemed like very elementary information. I have a pretty large canine library, and there wasn't really any new information here. It would be a great book, however, if you need an all around good reference book and really don't have any others. If your'e looking for a lot of breed information though, look elsewhere. This gives you the standard paragraph or two on each breed- nothing you can't get from a general dog breed book."
5,"""The Irepressible Toy Dog"" is a Win-Win read","As a practicing Vet,I found this book to be a veritable joy-it is replete with helpful hints that should make dog ownership pleasurable and productive; and to truly help enjoy the relationship.It is written with sensitivity and elan, and reflects her love for her beloved ""little breeds"". She knows her subject well, and is written from the heart. It is a masterful advisory, and admirably fills a void on this subject.This landmark book merits unreserved recommendation, and should enjoy an enthusiastic reception from our dog-loving public.Dr. Ray RussoKingston, MA 02364"
2,Not accurate for Havanese Health Info,"Unfortunately, the Havanese health info provided in this book is totally wrong. Our breed does not have PRA at all. Instead, we have heritable cataracts and that is the reason that reputable breeders and responsible Havanese owners CERF their dogs annually. In addition, the breed has occasional deafness, and even less frequently liver shunts, cardiac abnormalities, and sebaceous adenitis. Visit the AKC parent club website for the breed at www.havanese.org for ACCURATE information on the breed."
5,Sandra Hill and Dara Joy shine in these Christmas stories.,I thought these to be really good laid back christmas stories. Just something to pass the time. I enjoy short stories every once in awhile to break up the full size novels. These are really good.And yes I actually liked Sandra Hill's story.:}
3,Child's Book.,This is a book showing how to build a paper cutout model of a water powered sawmill. If you want to build an actual wood cutting sawmill then look elsewhere. Gave it a 3 only cause it didn't meet my purpose. May be a 5 for a kid. I got a good laugh when I received the book.
4,extra large over-the-calf mens socks,"It is very difficult to find mens black socks that are size 15. These are very good, in as much as they do fit over the calf, they are non-binding and and stay up and are neat enough for the most particular well-dressed man. You will be pleased."
2,"Dissapointing as compared to the rest of Richard Meier series (1, 2, 3 and 5)","I've been a fan of Richard Meier design and I collected book 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.Modern all white buildings with sometimes a touch of stones facade accent has been my admiration of Richard Meier design including his attention on very fine details.This book (Richard Meier 4) has not shown the quality of his work and his attention to details.First of all, some line weight of those drawings are thick or did not have the correct line weight to represent his conceptual ideas.Then some of those project has a totally different geometry or style as if it was not designed by him.Perhaps this book has been published without him checking the final layout before printing.Fortunately, book 5 has shown his quality back , similar to book 1 to 3."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"These DVD's have two speeds. One is super slow mo with endless banter - the other speed is super fast blur. The upshot of this is that you can't really pick up and apply the more advanced techniques that he is teaching - this is especially true with the guest pianists. The ""one on one"" discs help in this regard but I thinks it's essential to explain and show the techniques so all can follow when the are introduced. I would also appreciate the content being broken up into learning modules so you can ""go at this"" in a coherent fashion. It's ashame that the content is is so difficult to extract - because the content is good."
2,Lousy little yoga book,"Not expensive, but not worth much either. Ultimately, IMHO, doing asanas in bed is a bad idea--much better to do poses on a firm surface, i.e., the floor."
4,Stiff in the morning?,"This has some great exercises in it. Some I already knew and some I didn't. The ones I didn't are really good, however, I never really thought about doing them in bed and now I get them done as before I would get up and never get around to them and to say the least, the surface is a lot better. They have become a must for me every day, be it at night or morning. If I do them at night its easier to get out of bed in the morning, if I do them in the morning I have a great day. It's a great little book and I have had better days since I bought it."
4,Great book for beginners,"I've heard about the hype of Yoga, even went to a class at my gym. It was intriguing, and I stretched my body in ways I didn't know possible. But where was the continuation? Where was the follow up? That, sadly, was up to me.But I did not fear; I merely purchased Yoga in Bed. I was slightly skeptical, but upon receiving the book I headed over to my bed to try it out. My cats were a little freaked out by me stretching to unknown lands, but they've since adjusted. As has my body.I had a lot of lower back pain, and while I still do occasionally I've benefited and slept better because of the simple stretches in the book. I don't know if I would recommend this to veteran Yoga participants, this is a book for people who don't know what the hype is about but maybe want to check it out at home before committing to a class. Great way to stretch in the morning, and wake up refreshed."
5,Great Mother's Day find,"I was having such trouble with this year's gift for my mother, and then I saw a mention of this little treasure in People's Magazine. It's perfect! I've been wanting to share my yoga experience with my mom, but I could never find anything so accessible to a ""normal"" person. Somehow it manages to be both fun and serious at the same time. I totally recommend it!"
3,Product was not as pictured.,"All my display setup is gray. The pictured item is gray. The product shipped to me was reddish orange.I have several of these in my setup. I like them, I just wish they would have shipped this order the same color so it would have matched."
4,Good quality dishes.,"If you're looking for a good set of dishes at a low price, this is it. Keep in mind the water dish is pretty small, that's the only con I could find with this product. My crested gecko loves it."
4,Good for smaller lizards,"This wasn't a very good dish for my bearded dragons, however, for my chinese water dragons this dish did well."
3,Wrong Color! Pink Rocks!,These are nice bowls but they are definitely pink. There is a little stripe of gray on the larger bowl but nothing like the picture. If you want real looking gray rocks I would get something else.I gave it three stars because I actually like the pink and think the bowls look more like a shiny pink stone than normal backyard rocks. If you want something a little different then I would recomend these. I've never seen pink bowls like this in a store.
4,Review,This is an excellent book if you're interested in these old fashioned entertainments. It's the only one I've come across that covers this subject. My interest came from my childhood and this is probably its appeal. i would say that is mainly a look atEnglish machines although there is a little coverage of the USA. Photographs are plentiful and clear but there is hardly any examination or photos of the actual workings. To be fair I assume that the author was not allowed access.I bought it through pbbookshop who I would advise you to avoid at all costs. Having placed the order I found it cheaper and with better delivery elsewhere. You cannot cancel the moment you place your order. despite many emails I only receivedautomatic replies although you can find their phone number if you Google them. Amazon's feedback system does not allow you to easily find negative reviews easily (unlike Ebay)
4,"SO MANY LAME BANDS, PENNYWISE REMAINS PROMISING","With all the new bands that come out today, very few stand up to the crisp sound, the energy and the good lyrical message that Pennywise brings to the punk and rock scene. I have been a Pennywise fan for about 13 years now and I must say in that time-span, there has not been another band this good that has kept me coming back album after album. Pennywise improves with age and I'm thrilled that they have yet again produced another great album. I recommend you go buy a copy and add a great cd to your collection!"
3,"more of the same, and that's not a bad thing","This album sounds very similar to ""From the Ashes"" and ""Land of the Free"". If you like the sound of previous Pennywise albums, you'll probably enjoy this. ""The Fuse"" tends to be less openly political than other Pennywise albums (""Fox TV"" and ""18 soldiers"" being obvious exceptions. Also, the guitar riffs don't seem quite as prominent as previous albums."
3,Sounds generic,"This album isn't bad per se but it feels very generic. It sort of falls into a ""been there, done that"" punk style. You'll be hard pressed to figure out which track you have selected when listening to the first five seconds of each. If you really like Pennywise you will like this album. Otherwise, you'd do well to pass this album over."
1,where is the beef?,The phone WOULD be the ideal dream... ideal if it worked. I get horrid reception and phone cuts off half way through calls... and forget it working indoors anywhere! If that wasn't all.. the camera takes weak pics and the flash is of no use. I have tried to manually operate the camera for what the automatic selection lacks... either way i get pics that are too white or way too fuzzy. I've decided to return it for a cheaper model with less problems...
3,WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE,Can anyone tell me what is the difference between the Sanyo 8100 and this phone? I'm trying to figure out which one to get for Christmas. Please reply A.S.A.P. Thanks
2,Bad hinge,The flip phone hinges froze up and then one side at a time broke the plastic case and came apart until it broke the display cable. Takes the special y driver to replace the case and I can't find a Cell Phone store to replace the case.Also the data cable/charging port failed.
2,Please be aware......,"I have loved Ricky Valance's Tell Laura I Love Her since it came out in 1960.That's why I bought this C.D., as it is very hard to get the song on cd. However, and unfortunately, these recordings are not the original and as such are very disappointing to me.I didn't pay a great deal for my CD but it is not the money it's the disappointment that in the fact that for the past thirty years I have tried to get the original on CD.There was no information to indicate that it is not original recordings but we all live and learn!"
4,Worth it for just that one Track,The intrepid Weather Report are showcased excellently here. This cd's title cut has such a sweet grove to it that it's worth buying just for that piece alone with the nice bass playing and nice playing of Shorter.There is more music than that but I never make it past the first cut its so sweet!
4,Some Serious Jams.......Good Melodies Too,"Weather Report is one groovin' jazz/fusion band. The interplay between the brass, horns, bass, and percussion is phenomenal. Many of the seven tracks have fairly memorable melodies most notably Black Market. I love the switches in tempo on the lead off track with the sound effects and the building cresendo and the cool fade out with fireworks. Also like Cannon Ball with its mellow soothing keyboard touches with a nice far eastern touch. A very focused melody that will captivate your soul.Delightful CD cover too with pleasing blends of greens, reds, and blues. It just adds something special to this invigorating set of fusion/jazz."
5,Extremely happy with truly amazing results,"I started using Coseqiun (capsule form) for my cat of now 17 years two years ago when she was diagnosed with deteriorating hip joints and arthritis. She had slowed down on playing, and was lying around more so than normal. One day I even noticed her starting to struggle a touch when wanting to just get up. Since using this Cosequin ""tuna flavored capsule form"" she now runs, plays, and jumps around freely just as she did 10+ years ago... I give my cat a good heeping tablespoon of tuna every morning, and sprinkle and mix this with it, and she laps up every last bit of it..."
5,It works,I noticed an improvement in our cats mobility after using this for a while. Glocosimine Chondritine for Cats!
5,Cosequin for cats,"Product arrived promptly,in good condition! This product costs twice as much at Vets office. Somebodies making money!!!!"
3,Cosequin for Cats,"I bought this product because one of my 11 year old cats has bad arthritis in her hip. It was a lot less expensive to buy online than at the vet. It does help with the cat's mobility, but I ran into problems with dosage because you have to sprinkle it on the food and she shares with my other cat. So I was never quite sure how much she was getting.The other issue I ran into with these capsules was both cats starting getting upset stomachs. The vomiting was worse for the cat without arthritis. I have since stopped using this product and have been giving the cat with arthritis treats that have a therapeutic dose of glucosamine and condroitin (the main ingredients in Cosequin)."
4,Good stuff,"Glucosamine and chondroitin helps cats with joint discomfort, and also helpswith urinary tract health.Since I've been using this product (and it's been a couple of years now) my cat has beenhappy and healthy.I first bought it at the vet, and may I say, Amazon's price is a fraction of the vet's price."
5,14 yrs Young,My cat uses this I put his wet food and he is a 14 yr old OCI cat and he is pretty flexible and kitten like when using this product...
4,Better safe than sorry for my 22 yr old cat!,"I've been giving Norman - my 22 yr old tabby - Cosequin for about 18 mths. I put 1 capsule in his wet food every day. After ~6 mths I didn't think it was doing anything so I stopped giving him this. After a few months, I started back on a whim and do believe I noticed a bit more spring in his step. I'm gonna keep it in his daily diet just to be sure I'm doing everything I can."
4,Cosequin for Cats,"The glucosamine in this product, which was recommended by a vet, seems to be helping my cat's joints since his limp is much less pronounced and he can jump to a bed or sofa easier since taking it. I plan to by more when this runs out. The only reasom I didnt give it a 5 star was because it's hard for me to crack open the capsule. However, the powdered form is much better than the pill for his needs. He would like it even more if it were beef taste since his first owner brought mim up on that and he dislikes tuna. Still, 4 stars and a re-order stands.I chuckle to realize that he and I are both taking glucasamine! Yvonne Feeney 0.P."
5,"Gave energy to my overweight, lovable, older cat!","The cosequin sprinkle capsules have really helped my older (11 year old), overweight cat. I noticed his legs trembling at times when he was standing, and the vet mentioned he could develop (or may have) arthritis. Then, I found this on amazon with all the great reviews! I started adding 1 capsule, sprinkling it over his dry diet food, and immediately noticed an increase in his energy & movement (probably due to less pain, less joint swelling). Now I've been adding 2 capsules and this seems to enlivened him even more. It does not have any apparent side effects, and I love my cat dearly, and with more moving about, hopefully he can lose more weight. I recommend this product to anyone who has an older cat or overweight cat who could have joint soreness, swelling, or arthritis symptoms."
4,Seems to be Helping,"Started our 14.5 yr old cat on this about a month ago. It seems to be helping her. She no longer looks at us and waits to be picked up onto he couch. She just leaps right up, again. We have other cats, so I mix the powder with a small spoonful of plain yogurt. She eats it all, without any problems."
4,Cosequin review,Fast timely shipping... My cat was walking around better within a week.... product made the last year of his life better...
4,FYI,I use this product from a recommendation from my veternarian. My female kitty is very small and has a very small bladder and has an anxiety issue. This product is used to help any inflamation in her bladder and keep it more relaxed. It has been working because along with easing her anxiety in other ways she has not had a bladder problem in a year. I thought it was an odd rcommendation by my vet but worth a try.
3,Decent joint supplement for cats.,"We've been giving our two cats 2 capsules sprinkled on their food at each feeding time and have noticed a difference in the energy levels of both of them. They do play more and seem to be more active. Our senior cat doesn't seem to mind jumping up and down from the bed as much now, too."
5,Great for arthritic cats,My older cat contracted arthritis in her rear leg and could hardly walk without pain. After just a couple of weeks she is getting around like she used to and is able to jump up onto furniture and into chairs again. (who would have thought this to be a good thing with a cat?) Great product.
5,17 year old lady,"We call her an ""old lady"" only because she is 17 and mostly she lays around and doesn't move much - though she will still go up and down the stairs to the litter pan and jump up on the couches and beds for a cuddling. We give her the Cosequin daily or every other day and she has spurts of energy and will play like the little girl we know and love so much. I believe that this supplement has made a difference for her and has made the later part of her life a lot easier to move around. Definately a bonus to her when put in tuna for a snack!"
5,cosequin for cats,as always fast delivery and always an affordable price. Which is unlike the vets office. thanks
5,Amazing Results,"Our elder cat (rescued as an adult, but we've had her 11 years) seemed sluggish for several months and we suspected some arthritis in her left hip due to the way she sat and walked. A few days of Cosequin and she was running around the house. I have no doubt it will extend her life, but if not it will certainly enhance the quality of the life remaining."
3,If only I could get my cat to take it,"I read all the reviews and talked to my vet about this product. It sounds AMAZING and so perfect for my senior kitty! The bad thing is that he REFUSES to eat it. I've disguised it in his wet food. I've tried mixing it with the hairball formula he likes. And I even put it in baby food (chicken only, no preservatives or additives or etc... a treat I learned from the breeders) but he can smell it a mile away!Too bad its in a powder formula because I will not subject him to having me shove a whole pill down his throat every day. =( I only wish they had samples or even smaller boxes of this stuff so that my purchase wouldn't go to such waste."
5,"Our cat walks and finally runs again, he is 13 years old.","before we discovered this, our cat didn't jump or run too much, our vet told us he has arthritis, so we gave hime this and what a difference, he runs and jumps more now, I RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ON AMAZON!!!!!!!!!! we went to petsmart and they want $20 for 50 caps, and you get 80 caps for $14 on amazon."
5,Super helpful cat supplement,I have a cat that has something going on with a hind leg. The vet couldn't determine what it might be without spending a ton of money on x-rays and suggested we try this supplement. I have noticed a great difference in the way she walks and her overall happiness.
5,Cosequin for cats,"My 14 year old cat, Peppper, was having trouble with his joints, limping and trouble getting up. I saw this product on TV and decided to try it. After a few weeks of taking it he hardly ever limps. It is a great product and I would recomend it."
5,Cats Love It!,"I purchased this product for 2 of my older cats who are starting to show signs of arthritis. I've used cosequin on my horses for years and was really happy to see they make it for cats now. Both of my cats are very picky eaters, and they both eat it mixed in with their food. 1 of my cats I cut open the capsule and put it in his mouth, and he actually came back looking for more. So far, I'm really happy with it!update 11/14/11:I started to feed this to another one of my aging cats who started to develop a pretty significant limp. Within about a week of taking 1 capsule in the AM & PM, his limp is almost completely gone.. He's become more active again - by active he follows me upstairs and will sleep on the bed with me at night, whereas before he rarely was leaving the couch and making the trip up the stairs.I really do swear by this stuff...."
3,Would she be worse without these pills?,"Our girl Fiona Dorothy has been taking one capsule every night for the past couple of years. The vet charges an arm and a leg for these things, and I was very happy to find them here. Although the capsules are largish, they are easy enough to give to her, and that way we know exactly how much she's getting."
3,Seems to help when I can get my cat to eat it.,"I have a 14 year old cat who still looks and acts like a kitten but she is beginning to have problems jumping up on things. She misses her mark quite often! I was looking for a Cosequin product that would be easy to give and this one said it was good for finicky eaters. I tried sprinkling it on my cat's favorite foods but she turns her nose up most of the time. The few times she has eaten it, it seems to help her but I just can't get her to eat it regularly. I guess it is a good, fast acting product if you can get your cat to eat it regularly. Still looking for a product that my cat likes."
5,fantastic everything,"I purchased this product on a last minute basis, praying it would get to me before i ran out of my last dose for the cat. not only did it get to me by my deadline, it came before that!This product has literally breathed new life into my cat's life. After breaking a hip bone and kneecap due to a genetic brittle bone disease, he was left unable to do anything but crawl with his forepaws.He has spent years crawling like this, the vets told us he should be put to sleep. But I held on as he has so much want to live. Then I find Cosequin.You should see him now! I doubt he will ever walk again because he is too frail but he can get around so fast now, with such ease! He manuevers his body around with so much more coordination, strength and comfort,so that he can go across the room and enjoy the outdoors. I credit that fully to Cosequin. Thank for the years this has given back to us and to him!"
1,Negative,Not what I ordered. Most if not all capsules were empty or half-filled. Wonder if they even contain actual Cosequin or just filler.
1,Counterfeit. Do not buy!,"My 2 year old cat uses Cosequin for his bladder. The initial bottle we got from the vet worked perfectly and he no longer had urine crystals. A short time after we started him on the bottle we ordered from here, he lost weight, drank water CONSTANTLY (even slept by his water bowl), had no personality, and was very lethargic. After about a month of this, we remembered one other review that indicated these pills may not be legitimate, and immediately stopped giving them to him. Now, after buying a bottle from Petsmart, he is back to his old self: gained weight, drinking water normally, and interacting with us. I will never buy medicine online again and am mad at myself for making that mistake in the first place. I hope this review will prevent someone else from making the same mistake!"
1,Cannot get it into the cat,"My veterinarian recommended this product for my cat, but the instructions say to open the capsule and sprinkle the crystals over the cats food which gets you nowhere. If this product is made for cats, it should be produced in a product a cat will eat or that can be gotten into the cat. A dropper and flavored liquid might work, a chewable treat or a pill small enough to hide in food might work, this stuff doesn't. I'm not about to taste these crystals, but the cats reaction seems to suggest they don't taste good. Ergo, I bought two bottles and can't use them. Darn shame since the cat needs them."
2,Cat Pills,My cat has taken these for a year. They seem to be helping her arthritis. What else can you say
2,My Cats Hate This,"Cosequin is supposed to work really well for cats with arthritis. However, I've had 2 cats totally refuse to eat it, even if disguised in tuna or other meat. I'm not talking, simple refusal. I'm talking, the cat runs away. I wish this company would make the medication *tasteless*. Duh."
3,Jury not out yet,Just started this with my large cat .Have not seen much improvement with his bad joints yet
5,"Great product, fast delivery",This stuff works. My cat is up and about again. The product comes from Discount Pet Supplies and they shipped it quickly even though I used standard shipping. It's also half the cost of what my vet charges!
5,Cosequin for cats,I purchased this product on the advice of my vet for my 12 year old cat who suffers from arthritis. There has been a great improvement in her ability to walk with much less limping.
5,Works like a dream,"I have a 12 year old cat with a floating patella that gets the better of her and this supplement really makes a huge difference. In two weeks of faithful use she has gone from limping around the house to jumping back upon the bed. she is happier and its super easy to administer, I just sprinkle it on her food. I used this on another older cat that had so much difficulty walking and it made a huge difference to her quality of life."
5,great service/price,Ordering this product saves approx. 50% over the store/vet prices. It was delivered promptly too.
3,My cat is on his third week,My cat is almost 13 years old. I've noticed he's not jumping like he used to. He has some trouble walking after he's been sleeping. I'm hoping with a little more time he'll show more improvement.
5,Excellent supplement for Cats,"This Cosequin is a very good value. I use it for three cats: one with idiopathic cystitis one Cosequin capsule twice a day; one very old and arthritis one Cosequin capsule twice daily improved grooming; one with back/limb injuries when young, takes one Cosequin capsule a day with arthritis flare-ups. Would definitely recommend Cosequin for Cats purchased from Entirely Pets through Amazon."
3,not sure,"i don't know how to rate this. i only bought one bottle but our cat occassional coughs up a hair ball and after starting this, she began to vomit more often so we quit using it halfway thru the bottle. don't know if this caused it, i'm sure there are a lot of reason she could vomit- she is old, she eats too much (steals other cat's food if we aren't careful), eats too fast- but i couldn't take the risk anymore and since i stopped, the vomit has decreased. so i didn't use it long enough to see a difference in her joint movement"
5,Increases the quality of my cat's life.,My cat is a retired old man with joint pain. He is visibly more comfortable when I add this product to his food twice a day.
5,great!,Cosequin is a great drug...it's helped my sister's cat when he was getting up there in age (ok-old) and started to move more slowly....Cosequin definitely made it easier for him to get around smoothly. The product has also helped my cat Clyde who has been having some arthritic issues in his right leg...he couldn't jump and was achy and slow getting up from laying down. Now he is having no problems with either movement. Definitely recommend.
5,Fatboy's Happy Bladdar,The Cosequin is less than what we have to pay at the vet and it helps for a more balanced oversized Tom cat.
2,Not good for my cat.,"My cat has trouble with this medication. There are suppose to be no side effects but my 12 year old cat can't tolerate it very well. Initially got it at the vet's for double the money Amazon charges. He was suppose to get one pill on his food in the morning and another in the evening. He doesn't like it at all and I've had to mix it very carefully to camoflage the taste. After monitoring him, I had to cut it down to half a pill once a day. His problem is it makes him have very soft, uncontrollable bowels. I'm sure you know what I'm saying. I did notice his arthritis was improving but I didn't like having to clean up the poop. I now give it to him once every 3 or 4 days, 1/2 pill at a time.I personally don't recommend this."
2,l wish it was working..,"l thought l could tell that it helped after 1 month of using the capsule, twice a day.. but unfortunately l don'nt see any difference... maybe it takes longer. My cat is only 8 years, but his bag part is very stiff... l properly have to take him to the wet.. :(("
4,My cat loves it,"My cat loves this on her food, and she has been more active since she started taking it several months ago. This is my second box. She's 12 years old, going on 13, and has slowed down a lot in the past year. She has the precursors of arthritis, but no sign of actual arthritis yet, but my vet suggested starting her on this early. I've seen a difference - she's more active and picks on the dog more."
2,CAN'T GET CAT TO TAKE THEM.,I AM SURE THESE WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD GET MY CAT TO TAKE THEM. HE WON'T EAT ANYTHING BUT DRY CAT FOOD SO I CAN'T PUT IT IN HIS FOOD.
4,My kiddy shore front leg.,"Well it to soon to tell if it works, it seems to be doing some good, but he still has bad days. Maybe jumping down on hard tile floor is the problem, will buy throw rugs and put them in areas he jumps down from."
2,My cat got diarreah from it,"I bought this for my twelve year old cat, who is in excellent condition. I thought I would start giving him this supplement as to prevent any signs of aging and figured, if anything, it wouldn't do any harm. I would open the capsules and pour the powder into his usual mix of wet and dry food and he ate it all fine. Didn't even seem to notice. After the first week, I noticed he started getting bad diarreah so I immediately went online to do some research only to find out that one of the side effects are/can be vomitting and/or diarreah and some other ones. I immediately took him off it. I also didn't see any improvement but that might be because he was healthy and active to begin with. My advice: If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it! Hope this helps!"
1,not for my cat,"made my cat extreemly sick. She had very bad diareha the 2nd day. I contacted manufacter and spoke to lady about problems, She said some cats can't handle the product. They sent my $'s back for the product but not the shipping cost."
3,Easily Acquired Tastelessness,"There are actually only about 12 great songs on this CD, but among them are two or three that would easily have made the best 100 songs from the last millenium if the 30-ish Time and Newsweek editors given the assignment hadn't suddenly gotten the notion that they had been elected to make history and clogged those lists up with dreck like the theme from Titanic. Among those on this disk that should have made it: top 10 -- Spike Jones' ""Der Fuerher's Face,"" top 100 -- Spike Jones Cocktails For Two and top 1000 -- Mad Dogs & Englishmen. If your brother is over 40 he will love this as a birthday present and the price is right."
3,A good lighting manual for a beginning cameraperson.,"Blaine Brown's book provides a decent explanation of set lighting, it's instruments and protocol. The text, though, seems to speak more to the cameraperson or AC who is curious about lighting. There is a lack of attention given to the juicers and hammers who are actually creating and shaping the light. There is a considerable amount of text granted to electrics and the distribution of power, but much more thorough and much more practically explained definitions are readily available in Harry Box's ""Set Lighting Technician's Handbook."""
4,"A thick, but informative read.","My ONE complaint with this book is that there's a bit too much technical jargon for my liking, but then again knowing that is part of the film business so I'd better get used to it. The book tells you about all the kinds of studio lights out there and what situations they are used in. This reads more like a text book to me than a casual read, but I don't mind because it's regarding a subject that I find fascinating and is in my opinion one of the most exciting industries in the world!"
2,Recap!,"Well, this disc is a recap. If you want to review what you watched on the last three disks, this is a good thing. Seeing the storylines play out in three (instead of 12) episodes will help you see how they link together.But, if you just got done watching the other three disks and saw how the stories thread together early, this fourth one will seem like a waste of money because you pull nothing new out of it."
1,Not thick enough,"I had heel pain and purchased these to help. They did not work,they are not thick enough. It was as if I did not have them in my shoes. I liked the idea of them being sticky on one side to stay where I put them. If they made them twice as thick they would most likely work. I will try another style with double sided tape."
3,Christmas Cheer,"My 1 1/2 year old loves all of the Kidsongs dvds, but this is not one of her favorites. The main beef I have with this one is that just about all of the songs center around what people want/ are getting for Christmas. I don't like all of the emphasis on getting presents, and think the true meaning of Christmas is completely ignored here. Even Silent Night is an instrumental (the rest are sung by the Kidsongs gang).Songs Include:Deck the HallsAll I Want For Christmas is my Two Front TeethSilent NightFrosty the SnowmanJingle BellsSanta, Please Don't Forget MeIf I had a Pony for ChristmasThe Twelve Days of ChristmasRudolph the Red-nosed ReindeerSanta Claus is Coming to TownWe Wish You a Merry Christmas"
2,Kidsong missed the mark on this one,"The DVD was just OK. It only had 1 or 2 traditional Christmas songs and the remaining 5 or 6 songs were orignal songs that no one either don't know nor probably never heard before. I was hoping this DVD would have been a great way to introduce my 2 year old to all the traditional Christmas songs, but not the case. Also, the dancing wasn't the best either unlike many other Kidsong DVDs. I would not recommend this DVD if you want to enjoy it as a family, but as a toddler, like my daughter, would probably like it because of the many children that are on the DVD that are dancing and singing, plus seeing Santa Claus several times through the DVD."
3,Kidsongs is ok,I found it a little outdated but still worth viewing. My kids ages 2 - 6 enjoyed some of the songs more than others.
1,WHERE'S THE VOMIT BAG??!!,I used to be a Kidsongs fan but this is the worst one I've ever seen. Probably because the songs get stuck in my head and it just stinks! I'm never going to go shopping for this video again because these songs play over and over again!
2,Ghost Videos.. yummy I love em all!,I'm a big movie buff.. especially ghost stuff I love ghost hunters and paranormal stuff but to be specific here with this set of Ghost Killers just didn't do it for me. Sorry.. these were kindo of 'acting' type roles and just not the same as the paranormal stuff I'm into.
2,do not let the picture deceived you,the material used is of really poor material. it will run and even tear.this happened to mine as my nail has a split and the sharp edge of my nail entangle to the cloth material which resulted in a small tear.the batman belt that come with the set is a joke it is deformed and badly paintedoverall really not value for money
4,Batman Dark Knight Costume,The costume was a major hit. Runs a bit small so was perfect for 11 year old. Belt tie and foot fasteners not that durable but the look was defenitely achieved and many compliments were given!!!
3,Batman needs a seamstress,"Overall my 4 year grandson loved his costume,however I would tweak the manufacture a little. The cape is way too long so he keeps stepping on it therefore it tore at the seams pretty quickly, which I repaired. The costume itself was good however I sewed a snap at the neck because the velcro would not stay closed thus ""deflating"" Batman's muscle chest! I ended up ordering a different cape and now all is well!"
4,Much Better Than I Expected,"Based on the other reviews of this costume, I expected it to be terrible, but since I was buying this because the one I ordered a couple weeks prior was too big (and I don't expect it will fit my son for at least a year and a half) I didn't want to spend a lot on this smaller size replacement.The small size 4-6 that I ordered is still slightly too big for my thin/average height almost 5 year old boy, but it's not terrible. I have rolled up the boot covers and he wears it like that without too much complaining ... better than tripping all over the place.The muscle chest is not like other muscle costumes that are puffy. It's stiff, but my son has not complained that it's uncomfortable and he has worn it ALOT.Since we already had a hard molded plastic Batman mask, I like that this one came with a fabric one with the cape attached. He changes which one he wears all the time.For the price I paid, I definitely recommend this costume."
2,Son loves it but I'm not impressed,"Well, the costume doesn't look nearly as nice or fit as on the model stock photo (as to be expected)! The muscle chest caves in a little and overall just looks a little dumpy. I am going to safety pin parts of the costume Halloween night so that it looks more tailored rather than dumpy. The mask is what really makes this costume but unfortunately, the mask does not fit well and constantly falls into his eyes covering his vision. I can see it being very dangerous walking around Halloween night with it on!! The cape is attached to the mask. Overall, pretty disappointed but my 3 yr old doesn't see the flaws and loves it."
5,A Real Gem for Know-Nothing Design Neophytes,"If you haven't the first clue how to go about designing a web page that is visually appealing and easy to navigate, this book is the one to buy. Williams and Tollett showed me the error of my web designing ways--and I have a great looking site to prove it!Professional designers and Net-heads probably won't get much out of this book--but if you're greener than green and need to know how to design a site that works, pick this one up!"
2,A few years too late,"I enjoyed the non-designers print book, but the web book was disappointing. Specifically, it was a few years too late in what it was suggesting for me to be able to recommend it as anything but basic or background reading.A lot of the tricks and work-arounds presented were useful a while back but have now been replaced by common Javascript actions (eg, pre-loading images). Similarly, the author writes as if the browser wars were still being fought, when IE has pretty much won (I agree it's sad, but it's true).A lot of the history and background information presented is still true, but this book is a fair way behind even common practice, let alone the cutting edge. The book may be useful for novices, but there are much more up-to-date texts out there."
4,Makes the best of a bad situation.,"Given that designing a cool site is NOT simple--nor fun in my opinion--this book does as good a job as possible of getting you from zero to art designer/typographer/webmaster. Using this book, along with the GoLive Quickstart book, (price) worth of classes & 17 calls to Adobe, I managed to make a Yahoo Site of the Week in just under 9 months. And I was already pretty handy with Photoshop!Along the way, several people told me ""You could just as easily learn HTML and not have to deal with user-friendly software"". I suspect they were right.Still, a great job, all things considered. Besides, how many books would they sell if they said ""It ain't easy but this will help""."
5,Great book,"It made several points impactfully and was fun to read. It assumes you know little about the Web, so it should be the non-designer's, non webmaster's book. Give you the basics without feeling condescending. I'd love for them to extend the book more to cover the things possible with dynamic html, etc."
2,fine for beginners,"I would only recommend this book to someone who is a beginner or one who can not differentiate between good and bad design. I had hoped that this book would spend more time relating traditional graphic design rules to the web. I was disappointed. My take-aways from this book are limited to a couple alignment rules and a interesting idea for hiding large image downloads. If you understand how to use fonts and organize information on a web page, don't bother."
3,Good but over explains,I bought this book for a web design class that I am taking. Our professor is from a different generation from us. She didn't realize that we all know a lot by computers and the internet. Same with this author there are some really good tips and ideas. But the first part of the book way over-explains the simple concepts of the web that many of us already know. I thought that this book could really edit out a few chapters and that would make it a lot better.
5,Its a classic!,Williams comes through again with this thorough and witty guide to website design. A must-have for every web designer.
3,"The 3rd edition, forthcoming, probably corrects these flaws.","Wait for the third edition, which is due out in late August 2005. Perhaps it will contain more useful information about Cascading Style Sheets, which are almost an afterthought here. The web-safe color chart and explanation is useful, along with the section on typography. There's also a reasonably clear explanation of using Adobe PhotoShop to create repeating backgrounds. But the cute graphics are like jelly beans spilled over the pages."
5,The BEST book of its type in print.,"This is a superb book. Because the focuss is on design principles, rather than a particular software package or computer platform (Mac vs PC), it is destined to become a timeless classic. The pricing is also extremely reasonable.Ideal for new designers, I can't help but think that perhaps a few of the so-called ""web-design experts"" could learn a thing or two form it. Buy it first, before you even consider another book."
1,Web design promotion package,"After reading this book, I hope that Adobe, Mac Computers and Netscape are paying a healthy fee for the continuous plugs that their products receive.The information is somewhat realistic and helpful, but tends to wander from anecdotal to informational.The complete downplay of the need for understanding what that nasty code means is the reason that so many web pages have broken links and non-display graphics.To take a novice from ground-zero to interactive frames in one book is too much. As an introduction, this book covers too much information in too little depth to be helpful."
4,the way its written keeps you interested,I havn 't read all of this book but I had read an excerpt out of one of robin williams's other books and I loved it. She's very intertaining so she keeps you interested as you read.
1,Don't waste your money,"Unfortunately I was required to purchase this book for a Web class that I'm currently taking, even though I'm already an accomplished Web designer. I found a few errors in the book and also didn't care for the opinions expressed in it.If you're thinking of purchasing a book to learn how to design Web pages, look elsewhere. There are plenty of other great books out there. But this isn't one of them."
2,"Definitely dated, for absolute beginners.","I had read another book by this author (non-designers design/type book) and this one definitely doesn't measure up. There were a couple of useful subjects in this category, both of which are covered in vastly greater detail in her other books. I would say that most of the website and internet material is is for absolute beginners and even a little bit outdated. This should be expected I suppose since the book is 8 years old now.."
3,An OK book,"This book is OK for someone who might be trying to teach another the principals of webpage design. I had to buy it for a graduate level textbook and didn't see much use for it. It might be better used in the K-12 area, not college level."
3,It was OK....,"This GVB is a livelier bunch than has been previously presented. I did not enjoy this project as much as I did Everything Good, the last one with David Phelps. Maybe because I am an older generation, I don't like my music quite so jazzy sounding as this was. They are good, but not as good as some others in the past. Oh well... to each his own. Music is a very personal thing."
5,My new favorite Gaither Vocal Band DVD,"Along with superb music and vocal blending by the GVB, this DVD provides a personal introduction to the two newest memebers of the GVB and their families. Their interaction is delightful (be sure to watch the bonus material and the singing in the shower recordings). It is obvious that these guys love to be together and are in sync with each other. Being a Hoosier, I enjoyed the segments from St. Elmo Steak House and Conseco Fieldhouse. This DVD was taped before an audience of GVB and Homecoming singers and their families, as well as a few special guests whose contributions were recognized. The setting provided a unique dynamic for the singers, resulting in an excitement that is contagious."
4,costa gavras,"if you are looking for the music from the movie satate of siege by costa gavras, don't buy this CD."
3,"Great music, poor video.","I love Poncho Sanchez and I was looking forward to seeing this ""live"" performance on DVD but I have to say I was disappointed with the video production quality. The sound is great, the band swings, but the video quality is less than it should be. It appears to be in perpetual soft focus but there are hard uneven lines outlining the musicians on the shoulders and sleeves of their clothing which I found distracting. Unfortunately there are not a lot of latin music DVDs out there so I have to recommend it anyway. Poncho and his group deliver the goods. It's just too bad the video production quality doesn't match the sound quality or the performance. Buyers should also be aware that this is not in a widescreen format."
1,Not the tape gun pictured.,I ordered this gun after searching for one like the ones we had. I found this gun pictured to be an exact match to what we had so I ordered it thinking it was what I wanted. I was sent a gun different that the one pictured.
1,I liked my old tape dispenser better,"We had the old version of this tape dispenser with the non retractable blades and were very happy with it. When someone walked off with the old one, we bought this one as a replacement and it I must say that I'm very disappointed. The retractable blade makes using this dispenser awkward. We find we are forced to dispense more tape than we need every time we use it. The old version used to allow you to dispense pieces as small as an inch. With this one, I find myself using a foot or more than I need every time. I am returning this item for one with a non retractable blade."
2,Falling Flat on Face,"Similar in concept to No. 5 in the series, but without the same degree of success. The result here seems forced, without any apparent chemistry between cellist, choreographer, and dancers. Borrow this if you want to see a documentary about a failed artistic collaboration."
5,Invisible Church,Excellent reading if one is interested in the state of our organized church today. This is a prophetic book of what is to come if you are a follower of Jesus Christ.
3,Good overview but sometimes confusing,"I bought this book based on the reviews of the first edition. I generally like the book for its fast paced introduction to XML. However, I find some of the examples confusing and I do not like the way the author always has you jumping around to different pages for information. Furthermore, there are some pointers to other pages that are wrong. Also, alot of information is put in ""sidebars"". Some of these sidebars are multiple pages so I do not understand their purpose. I find myself referring to Holzner's ""Inside XML"" a good amount of the time for clarification. If you want a quick and dirty intro to XML, this book is for you. If you need to learn XML, you will want Holzner's book in addition to this. Holzner gives you best practices as you read whereas this book does not. For example, this book uses the MIXED format for declaring elements within DTD's. However, Holzner does not recommend this and tells you why."
4,Very informative,"The author does a pretty good job at laying out the basics of XML in a step-by-step fashion, although he does tend to be a bit verbose - just like the language. Still, if you are a beginner (I'm assuming at least a bit of computer knowledge here) and you want to get up to amateur speed, then this is a good book for you. He does a good job at detailing, not only the basics of the markup language itself, but also the schemas that accompany it vi-a-vis data expression and content, such as .css style sheets, the interrelation of XML and HTML, and .dtd for data regulation."
2,Note: Confusing. We'll talk later.,"This book is filled with ""notes"" that interrupt your train of thought. He introduces topics he has no plans of telling you about till later but you can't thoroughly understand the current subject because it (somehow) all ties together. He may not discuss something till chapters later.This book, too, tends to start you with the details, then leads you to how their used which means you don't know where you're going till you get there, but by then, you're bored or give up.I felt I was just plodding along but not getting anywhere."
3,Indian experience,"If you like Indian music, this is very easy listening. It is not punjabi music, which I love. Rather it is more pensive with some upbeat numbers."
4,Highly recommended,"Nitin Sawhney is an old hand now at indo-fusion and it is evident in some of the pieces in the soundtrack. He has used various iconic indo-fusion artists such as ""State of Bengal"" and ""Susheela Raman"" to bolster the soundtrack.The pure flute numbers used as the core theme as well as for the titles are excellent. There instrumentals have a lilting quality with an outstanding melody.The Salil Chowdhury-esque bengali ditty, ""Jhiri Jhiri Choyetali"" is a gem, sung wonderfully by Geeta Dutt. The kids will love it.There are also samples of raw Bhatiyali and Baul music and the usual chill out fusion numbers. The Bhatiyali and Baul tracks may or may not appeal in this age of percussion heavy music, but it provides a glimpse into the culture of Bengal.""Falling"", the last fusion track on the album is excellent.One other number that stands out is Susheela Raman's version of an old bollywood number ""Ye Mera Deevanapan hai"".This album comes highly recommended."
5,Namesake Soundtrack,I loved the movie and had to have the soundtrack. I love Indian music. It was inexpensive and worth getting through amazon. I love listening to it.
4,Beautifully Relaxing,"I loved the movie by the same name, so what better way to evoke memories of such a well-loved film than by listening to its soundtrack. Even if you've never seen the movie, the music in and of itself is powerful, rich and relaxing. It will make you want to see the movie."
4,As good as the movie!!,"If you enjoyed the movie, you won't be dissapointed with the soundtrack. It actually has the music from the movie, imagine that!"
4,Excellent workout for beginners and intermediates,"Most of these ""crunches"" are variations of Pilates exercises. They are well-presented, explained, and performed. I am a Pilates instructor and they were a bit easy for me but I do them as an adjunct to my regular workout. I love the warm-up -- sometimes I do it 3x just for a quick cardio workout!"
1,waste of time and money,I can't believe how bad this sealant is. This product shrinks immensely and cannot cure whatsoever in moist conditions. Big Stretch is right. Big stretch of a decent product.
3,works?,I have not used as of yet. We will see if it adheres when I use it. I need to add a few words.
3,Good product,"I used this big strech wood caulk to fix a long cut line in my hardwood floors. It works well, and is flexible enough to stop the floor from bowing (due to bad install). However, it dries two shades darker than the cap appears, so it does not match my floor as close as i would have liked.(it has been installed in my house for the last 3 months)"
2,"Richard Tyson is a God, but this is not his best movie.","I am a major Richard Tyson fan and try to see all of his movies; however, this one was kind of a disappointment. Besides the fact that he wasn't in it much, the story was not the greatest. With the exception of a very erotic love scene in an undergound cavern with millions of candles on the rocks, the rest of the movie can be cut out."
2,Lots of enthusiasm but doesn't translate to the reader.,"This book was clearly written by someone who loves pirates and knows a lot about them. Unfortunately it's packed so full of names, dates and places that there's no real room for narrative. As a reader I was so worried about which name went with which ship in what part of the world and under whose flag that I was often burned out on the subject after half a chapter.It includes maps which are very good and essential, and there are 'boxes' at the end of each chapter containing anecdotal information (such as chapter 2's ""Elizabethan Era Navigation"") that are more charming and easy to digest than the main text.I quite honestly wanted to like this book, even while I was reading it, but the author never fully developed the narrative thread that would have made this sweeping look at 250 years of piracy read like anything other than a textbook."
1,This book's title is misleading...,Water Soluble Oils is the title.I was looking for a book that would show and demonstrateThe pro's and con's of water soluble oils.Page 11 is the only page that mentions something aboutwater soluble oils and it is of little consequence.OIL PAINTING FOR BEGINNERS should be the title.This book has a lot of good information for these beginnersand is worth buying under those premises.I agree with reviewer shirleyjones9 (I wish that I had readher review before making this purchase.)I gave a low rating because I have wasted my moneybecause of the misleading title.Shame on the publisher/editor/author who are responsible forthis deception.Are there any water soluble oil books out there byprofessional artists who demonstrate the highest levelof craftsmanship that one can respect?Let me Know. Thanks.
2,Not really about water soluble oils,"It was not what I expected. Or, maybe I expected to much?It does not go really well into the water soluble oil painting techniques. The title does not match the content."
5,"Uplifting, Soul Speaking Music","I am lucky enough to hear Jeff play often. His lyrics are so heartfelt...intimate prayers with God. His music has strengthened my relationship with God. After listening to his music for some time now, the beauty of it can still bring tears to my eyes, chills over my body and an uncontrollable feeling of love for the Lord ready to burst from my heart!"
2,It was okay,"I am tired of reading books about dometic violence and physical abuse. There are too many books on this subject and still no answer? I was rather confused by the characters in this book. Try, ""My Brother's Keeper."""
5,Up Close and very personal,"First person point of view is not my favorite read. When I started this book, it was so compelling I didn't realize this was the POV. It could not have made an impact any other way. This story is so vivid and told with so much passion. C. F. Hawthorne is a talented writer and I look forward to more of her stories. This is a MUST READ."
5,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book to an extent. There were really some unrealistic parts to this book that were really outrageous, but other than that I thought this book was okay. I can't wait to read her other books."
4,Good Book,This Book takes on domestic violence head on! The only reason why this book did not get five stars is because the author gave away too much on the back cover of the book! Good read for anyone that is in a situation of abuse and think that it is ok.

3,Humoring with good fight scenes,"Sure, the panning and the transfer of this movie may not of been so great, but I enjoyed the movie anyway. I certainly don't get these movies for Hollywood style or quality. The 5 clown like ghost threw me off, since I would not of expected to see that in a Kung Fu movie. I liked some of the close ups as it allows you to see how to do the strike better. The Five Animal Style is classic Shao-Lin and this movie gives you a good idea of how it looks and how to execute it. Corny, yet funny, I give this move 3 stars. And learning Shao-Lin Kung Fu myself, I find Spiritual Kung Fu educational."
1,Ruined by a Terrible Transfer,"I'm a huge Jackie fan, but this movie was insufferable. I don't mind the weak story; I'm here for the fighting. But the problem is that this transfer was incompetantly done. The movie crops most of the fight scenes, and the inexplicable camera work is hightened by the miserable panning. The colors are washed-out, the audio is terrible, and the source film is badly blemished and scratched.If, someday, there is a retouched, remastered release, I'll covet it for my collection. Meanwhile, don't waste your time on this one."
3,Spiritual Kung Fu (1978),"This film is very vulgar. A meteor crashes to Earth, releasing 5 spirits who teach Jackie Spiritual Kung Fu also known as Five Fists Style. Jackie uses these otherworldly techniques to retrieve a stolen kung fu manual for the Seven Fists Style."
4,Jackie Fans!,"This is a classic film in Jackie's early career and a personal favorite. Love this film bit this dvd, albeit manufacturer or seller, is a bit choppy and some original screen shots are cut off leaving it seem like a pirated copy. I originally saw this film from a friend who owned it in a three vhs pack so i know its off. Other than that delivery was prompt and hassle free."
3,Not Widescreen!,"This format is not widescreen and therefore, you lose 30% of the movie because you cant see the sides! It would have been a great vintage Jackie Chan movie, but the formatting ruined it for me."
3,Good if you don't mind hokey,"I watched this movie with my sons (ages 9 and 7) and could only handle about 30 minutes of it because it was just so hokey, but my boys really enjoyed it, and had fun making up their own Shaolin moves for the rest of the night. They called me back in for the fight scenes later in the movie, and those are certainly worth watching because they are not bloody messes but are instead really intricately choreographed displays of martial arts technique. One other thing worth noting: it seemed as though the camera had zoomed in too far because it cut out important parts of the scenes. I didn't see an option to change it from full screen to wide screen, but if there is a way to do that, it would make a big difference."
3,Could have been worse,"I like the movie despite its mediocre acting and fight scenes. ""Spiritual Kung Fu"" does have its moments (not that many of them though). I doubt most people would like this film, and I would only recommend it to the most die hard Jackie Chan fans."
3,This is a dance workout that shouldn't be attempted on a carpeted floor.,"I purchased this DVD because it was one of the few that didn't mention complicated dance moves or needing special equipment. However, in the short workout preview, the instructor mentions that this workout shouldn't be done on carpet (can be modified to work, but you can't follow the main instructor) and that it is necessary to watch an instructional session multiple times in order to be able to participate in the workout. I just want to pop something in and start my workout, but this was too complicated. I spent money on it so I'll put in the necessary hours to get to the point where I can use this DVD but I don't recommend it. ""Ultimate Fat Burn,"" is much more simple and is a great workout.(I came to say that after doing the first half of the work out a few times I've gotten pretty good at it and it isn't as difficult as I previously thought. Now I'm going to try the second half of the DVD. It is a great aerobic exercise.)"
5,So Super Fun!,"What a great work out! If you are a bit uncoordinated like me, it may take a few times to get the moves down. Once you get that its so much fun. You don't even realize you're working out. And Christi's super positive attitude keeps you motivated the whole time. The results are awesome! After doing this video four days a week for three weeks I lost several inches and was finally able to get rid of that baby pooch I had after having my daughter."
2,Don't waste your time with this book,"This book only gives the absolute bare minimum of training guidelines. It will give you a decent idea of what exercises to do, and a tiny bit of the reasons why to do them, but that is all. The authors suggest doing some very simple exercises like the bench press, for which they show photos. For the very complex, and somewhat dangerous, plyometric and power development exercises, they give almost no detail on how to do the exercise. Why would they show photos of simple exercises that everyone knows how to do, and then just skim over the complex ones that they suggest are the most important exercises??"
3,Good for newbies to fitness,"I encourage anyone who isn't very active to get this book, especially if you're interested in cycling. But for someone that's got years of experience in the weight room, this book won't help you so much. I have trained for fitness competitions, but I bought this book because I'm new to cycling. The exercises in it are standard, with nothing really new to help you performance-wise if you're already an experienced lifter.Basically it can be summed up with lunges, squats, etc., with enough upper body and ab/lower back work to keep you balanced, all of which can be found in any exercise book. I'm kind of disappointed, as I thought it would be more sports-specific, but like I said, it'd be great for newcomers to fitness and cycling in general."
2,Good information but fails to pull everything together.,"I read this book cover to cover as I am interested in the subject. Overall I found it to be very informative but the book failed to link the different articles correctly and the sample programs just add to the confusion.For example in the Power Phase of the program, power exercises are lumped in with strength exercises and some things just don't make sense. One of the exercises specifies doing 3-4 sets for 1-5 reps of squats with a rest period of ""none"". Does that mean you really just do 1 set of 15-20 reps?"
2,Very generic.....,"This book offers no real insight other then the standard thoughts like cyclists should do high repetitions with low weight so as not to build bulky muscles. Other standard thoughts include varying your workout over time to constantly stress your muscles so they don't become too accustomed to one particular workout routine. The author references his personal training program available via his website one too many times for my taste. When reading the book you get the feeling that the ""cycling"" aspect of the book seems more the result of a search and replace operation in a word processor versus a book really geared towards cyclists.If you haven't spent much time in a gym lifting weights then this book might be more valuable then I found it."
5,Loved it!,"I have always read in bike magazines that the way to improve your strength on the bike you need to lift weights. Problem is, I don't know the right way to do it! This book gave me all of the knowledge I needed to design a training program and perform the exercises correctly and safely. I'm already seeing the benefits!"
4,well presented,"I found the advice to be well presented and thought out. I am a non professional cyclist and some of it was too detailed and geared to a racing season approach. Overall though it was informative and interesting, with some valuable tips about how to avoid injury that i had not encountered."
4,A great gift of a 12 year old,"I am not an expert in archery by any means, but this bow works very well for its realtively small price. It does take some strenth to pull the bow to the point where the tension releases, but my son got that part under control after some practice.Like most sets, the arrows are not the greatest. They did not last long. Buy a dozen decent arrows and a cube target on Amazon or from you local big hunting store when they are on sale.Obviously, this is a dangerous item. You can overshoot a target by 50 feet, so be in the open and under parental control at all times."
5,Barnett Banshee Bow,Great bow for young teens who are just starting out. Nice draw and letoff. Strong enough so they don't feel like it's a toy but light enough that they can use it. I will buy this again for my son when he gets older.
4,arrow combo/set,"This was a great buy for the price and a great little starter bow. The only complaint is that he arrow's aren't the best in the world and break fairly easy. We just went and bought more arrows. The bow itself my son loves. His words, ""This is the best gift I have ever been given."" He just turned 13 years old, and has never been exposed to archery before. He loves it."
3,Powerful,My son got this and he shot one really far on the first day. He then lost it and we had to purchase new arrows it is a good coumpound bow and I would recommend it to a friend
1,The arrows ruin it,The tails all broke too easily. Too bad because it was so much fun for my 9 year old to play with. I can not recommend it. You end up with a bow that is useless.
3,Draw is high for 11 year old,"Researched several bow and arrow sets. My son did his research and wanted to buy this one. After donig my own research it sounded like the right set.Like others have said, the arrows are not of high quality. Our interest was more in the Bow. My son had learned archery at summer camp and was pretty good at it. The one concern I had was about the 25 lb draw. After reading several reviews and other research I decided this was a good purchase (my son bought with his own money).The draw seems a bit high in terms of resistance and is not adjustable. Some research said to be careful about resistance for kids because of risk as their muscles and joints are growing.The build quality seems good and would be fine for an older child or adult. For our situation the resistance reduces the fun and poses health concerns so we will be getting a bow with lower resistance.The rating has nothing to do with quality, it is for the fit to our need."
3,UPGRADES NEEDED / PACKAGING,THE COMPOUND BOW WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL BUT NEEDED SOME TWEAKS. THEY NEED TO HAVE BETTER DIRECTIONS WITH THE PACKAGING ON HOW TO PROPERLY USE THE BOW & ARROW TOGETHER. THE ARROWS THAT CAME WITH IT THE VAINS WERE SQOOSHED IN THE PACK AND HAD TO SIT FOR DAYS TO RELAX BEFORE THEY WOULD FLY CORRECTLY. BUT OTHER THAN THAT MY 16 YR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES IT.
3,"Bow is ok, but arrows hard to find.","My 14 year old boy can use this with the 25 pound draw, one of his younger friends can't - certainly sufficient power for targets and even some hunting (if your into that). The quality is ""ok"", I do wonder about the pulleys over time.BUT, it only comes with 2 arrows - one is already lost somewhere under the grass. It takes a 27 Inch youth arrow - VERY hard to find. I only found one on Amazon (and none in stores) that is for another set, we shall see if that fits. Now that I know this I would look for something with a more standard arrow length - 26 or 28 inches. I don't know if the 28"" arrow would work as well or not - comments welcome."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad.","I bought a Banshee Jr., a Banshee Quad, and a Lil' Banshee for the grand nephews and niece. The Banshee Jr. wasn't too hard to convert to a left-handed draw, but it required some less-than-safe adaptations of the cable press. As it stands now, the Banshee Quad is fine for the 14-year old nephew, but the 12-year olds struggle a bit with the Quad and the Jr. The wife can only draw the Lil' Banshee, and the 10-year old niece can't yet pull the Lil' Banshee.The cams on the Jr. and the Quad have two pivot holes, but I can't find any info on what changes if you switch to the other holes. The arrows are a joke. They hit the target (bag-type) and fall to the ground. The kids are using my carbon arrows."
4,10 Year of Girl,"I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter. She is unable to pull the string back at this time. That being said, please do not expect this bow to be appropriate for a young child. My daughter is not super strong or super weak. Just know this is a possible issue. Also, the bow set does not come with an arm guard. You will also need to purchase additional arrows. The two are not enough. Overall, it is a good starter bow. Overall pleased for the price."
3,Good Bow,The bow and arrow set is intense. Hard to pull back for a 12 year old. It will be great once she figures out how to use it. Probably needed an instruction booklet on how to use it.
3,Great bow with some drawbacks,"Overall, the bow is very powerful and can have precise shots. Obviously, this is for target practice, not hunting. The arrows and light and easy too use.Unfortunately, there were some major problems.Once the strings got very very tangled up and it took months for me to fix.Also, the arrows are easily broken. One of mine shattered, and the other one's notch fell off and the ""feathers"" fell off. The arrows aren't for long term use.Once again, the bow is fantastic and comfortable to use. It may be a little hard to operate at first but gets very handy and fun."
5,Good Write Cowboy!,"I wanted to finish the book the first night I started reading it but instead I strung it out over a week so I could look forward to reading more each day. Duane's spirit of adventure struck a chord in me and will inspire anyone who loves the mountains and the wild west and who has dreams and a desire to follow them. His honesty, wit and vulnerablity made for a very entertaining story. I laughed and I cried and I was sad to finish the book. Thanks Duane for sharing your life with us and good ride cowboy, good ride. Chris Nolt, Bozeman, Montana."
1,The Flush is not the best.,I tried the Spa System Flush 3 times to no avail. The liquid just didn't cut the grime and gunk.
5,Excellent!,"I found out about this book in the Romance forums here on Amazon. I tried the sample and couldn't stop reading! It was an excellent story, exciting and tender. Also the book is very well formatted for the Kindle. I appreciated that as well."
5,This is a wonderful book!!,"This is the first Sharon Ervin book I've ever read. This is also the first review I've ever written.When I read the plot I thought this could not be a good book. But then I read the reviews and I knew I needed to take a chance. I mean, how could these reviewers all be wrong?They weren't. I loved this book! It was wonderful. I read all of it in one day. I plan on reading it again and again.I've now read most of her other books and they, too, are wonderful.Take a chance on this book if you like a good romance. Most of you may love it like I did."
4,My mountain man,"I also love this beauty and the beast theme in romance, and Bo definitely makes this theme come alive. Bo is an eccentric, reclusive, and implacable mountain man, all shaggy, a bit unkempt and rugged looking. It's worth reading this story just for Bo alone. I thought he was just an unusual character, his odd outward appearance hiding something much deeper inside.This book grabbed me from the sample. I just had to read it. One of my favorite themes in romance is the kidnapped/captive theme so the only thing that kept me from loving this book is the ending. It's not a bad ending, definitely HEA, but it does seem discordant considering the first 3/4 of the book. Before the ending, the story is unusual, gritty, less formulaic, and the last three chapters or so are a little too happy and almost have a let's explain and make everything smoothed out feeling.On the whole, I enjoyed the writing here, the amazing hero, and the unique story concept. Good read."
5,Very Good!,"This is a comparatively easy read (if compared to someinsufferable history books I read in college), and it is also veryinformative. No new age [stuff] -- just scholarship and very goodanalysis. This survey is much better than Hans Jonas in that itincorporates Nag Hammadi findings, and is not as hostile. The selectbibliography at the end is a jewel ..."
5,A Good Overview,"For someone looking for a reasonably detailed and well-written introduction to Gnosticism, this is an excellent starting point. Covering most of the major Gnostic phenomena, it covers a difficult topic in a way that is pretty easy to get into.Sometimes, it is a bit ""wordy"" and heavy going, though overall, it is an excellent intro.I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,to Heady,"This book may be helpful to some, not me. It all seemed to be to heady, if that is a word, and I didn't feel the urge to go past the first page. As I said maybe for some, not for me."
5,I give this Video 10 **'s - Webmaster of Wicked Reggae Site,"After going to several Sunsplash concerts, I can't get enough, and this video shows some vintage footage of legendary reggae artists such as Burning Spear & Yellowman! This video is a collector's DREAM!One love,Jah Schreiber"
1,Pigeon Fanatic,"If you have a fanatical need to know about pigeons, then this novel is for you. The book would have been more stimulating if the romance was tied to where the action was - pigeons in love, pigeons in love triangle, pigeon jealousy etc. The only thing I can remember about the heroine is that she likes pigeons. I did like the title however."
4,A well done history of modern physics.,"I regard Abraham Pais as one of the best physics historians. Helge Kragh in this book manages to present quality and attention to detail as comparable to Pais as can expected without being inundated with equations. Kragh is capable of biographies as complete in detail as Pais; i.e. ""Dirac: A Scientific Biography""A fraction of this book provides incidental historical details complete with charts and graphs, i.e. the number of spectroscopy papers written between 1890 and 1910, or the raise of physics in the USA, and effects of the war on physics, etc. Now historians proper, will expect this in a history of twentieth century physics, but if you are purely interested in the development of modern physics theories, this will seem like padding, although perhaps interesting. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly."
2,A cure for insomnia...,"I used this as a textbook in a college course on the history of 20th century physics. Kragh may be factual, and he may be a good historian, but he simply is not a good writer. (Even the professor admitted it was a good book to aid in falling asleep.) Emilio Segre offers a more personable view in From X-rays to Quarks, which I found far more valuable."
1,An Existential Affair,"Poorly written, poorly acted, cheaply produced.This was obviously not a professionally produced film.It was inadequate in almost every way.Low quality video equipment and low quality audio equipment.Very few locations and or sets were used."
1,An Existential Affair,"Never finished it because the acting and characters were so poor. Waste of money. Don't even bother with this one! You will be wasting your money. The Directing, locations and everything were POOR! I would not have even given this one a star but there is no other option."
1,dont bothet,the worst thing since never. this was a complete waste of time money and brain matter.worst money ever spent
1,Worst movie ever.,This isn't even softcore porn. And as far as. The acting? This isn't even good enough for porn acting and that's saying a lot. this is a poorly designed and produced POV in the porn industry.
5,best slide,"This is by far the best slide out there, My 2 year old son loves it. It is very sturdy and has enough room at the top to sit down, nice high sides to hold on to. other slides are too small this one is perfect. Well worth the money, highly recommended."
4,Wheeee!,"My girls love the slide, not too big, not too small. My 32 month old can go up the ladder and slide down by herself. It would be nice if the end of the slide ended with a little horizontal, instead of the angle all the way down, they slide and fall down to the ground. I need a big foam square or something to put down there. It's very well made, fun and stable, great slide, but get ready for grass stains on bottoms!"
4,Kids are very happy,"My two sons love this slide, its made very durable but i had to sand down the sides of the slide. The plastic molding where the two piece of plastic connect just needed a smoothing with some sanding paper as I felt my kids hand were going to get sliced up."
4,Best Buy,"Originally, we bought the Little Tykes equivalent. After assembly was complete we realized it was torn and had to return it. We were given the Step 2 as a replacement. Such a better deal straight out of the box. Already assembled and a better design. My 3 year old gave it his highest rating. Price was a concern b/c Step 2 website price was cheaper than what I paid. The slide makes up for the financial hiccup in design and ease of assembly."
4,Fun,Just got this slide for our almost 2-yr-old boy. It's fun and we like the natural look to it. I wish there was a little more room on top so my son could sit down better. Also handles on the sides on top would be useful.
4,Great Slide for my 2yr and 4yr olds!!,We just opened this slide today. It seems to be quite sturdy and my 22 Month old daughter has no problems whatsoever climbing and sliding over and over again. It is also a good size for my 4yr old son. We are very happy with this purchase. I hope it lasts for years to come.
2,Kids lose interest fast,We have two slides in our back yard. One exactly like this. Both are rarely used as they should. One is used as a ladder to get on the trampoline and the other is a now a lawn ornament.
4,my 2 1/2 yr old son likes it a lot,i hate putting things together so i was VERY happy at it arriving nearly ready to use out of the box. i purchased it for play time in the basement but it has pretty much stayed in our den. my son ran to it as soon as i brought him home for day care and he is on it all the time. I suggest that you have it in a carpeted area as my son has fallen attempting to climb on it backwards and every other way. but he has not been injured and gets right back up on it. its tall enough for fun but not so tall that you'll need the EMT
4,Kim,"We got this toy for our 2 year old daughter for her Birthday in August. She loves it. I only gave it 4 stars, because she's still a little scared to go down it. I'm thinking it might be a little better when she's around 2 1/2. Plus she's never around other rambuctious kids, so that might be part of it too. She loves steping up the ladder and sitting on the slide. We've used it as a fort a few nights. We covered it with a sheet and used a flash light, what fun! I also wanted to note that it was super easy to put together. You do not need your man for this. You just screw 2 screws in for the two base parts with a typical phillips screwdriver. So, simple! Overall this is a great slide."
4,Jim Reeves Is Always Good!,"I am a died in the wool Jim Reeves devotee. Everything on this CD is excellent. BUT, should one have more than a couple of Jim ""live,"" you will find this has some ""recycled"" numbers. However, if this is your first, or second. Jim Reeves ""live"" you will enjoy this."
2,"Design Inspirations, Vol 1","This is a brief overview of Design. I found it unsatisfactory. I was expecting a book similar to Charlott Moss' book ""Winter Home"". Winter Home is a delightful book. Design Inspirations, Vol 1 was not."
5,A helpful read,"Everyone could use a little abundance in their life and that's what Silver strives to show her readers. The book is written from a slew of spells and practical advice that she used when she was struggling with financial difficulties.She has practical advice along with spiritual advice, so readers can begin to stop their debts, tackle existing debts and do something on a higher plane to help bring in money and pay off the debts that seem to hang over their heads.Of course, if you're really that strapped for cash, you probably shouldn't be buying this book (especially not new). You'd be better off finding spells and other magical information online, or, buy the book used from the marketplace which would be the better idea. You won't regret it."
3,A Good Stepping-Off Point,"There is nothing inherently wrong with the spells within this book, I just believe strongly for a spell to be the most effective-- ie, to best reflect your intended outcome-- you have to write them yourself, catered to your particular dieties and desires. This is a good basis for people who haven't been casting for long, but should really be used as just that-- a base-- from which you craft your own spells."
3,Abundance Collection,This book is a collection of abundance spells. This is a good book if you need it. How many abundance spells does it take to work? I guess if one works for you that all you need. The question is which one?
2,"Known problems, should have kept searching","This is a very good water filter in terms of the water quality it produces. However, installing and mounting this puppy was not so good. There is a know problem with leakage relating to the elbow joint at the top of the filter. So, our entire under sink area gets wet and currently we have to keep a big pan underneath to catch the water. The manufacturer is aware of this problem, and promised to send a replacement elbow to fix it. That was about three weeks ago and still nothing received. If I lived in the US and could return it, I would. But alas, here in Costa Rica it would cost as much to return it as to just eat the cost and throw it away. Which is what we will end up doing. Very disappointed in the customer service from Doulton. Two stars only because it would be unfair (!!!), since the filtering is actually very good."
5,LOVE THIS FILTER,"We bought this about 6 months ago and LOVE IT! We love the ease of this system, as well as the taste of the water. I read many reviews for many systems, and the price, ease of one cartridge, quality of the faucet, all make this a big thumbs up for me.The water flow has diminshed, so I'm going to order a replacement filter. That should do the trick...so for a family of 5, we got about 6 months on the filter..and we drink a LOT of water!"
2,What Are They Saying?,"According to the back of the case this film is subtitled. When I played it and found it wasn't I thought I could turn the subtitles on like you can do on most subtitled DVDs. There isn't even an option! Lots of instructions in English but no way to find out what the actors are saying.So, if you speak Danish or you don't care what's being said this film might be for you. I don't know since I only watched a few minutes of it."
1,Horror Freak,"This movie was terrible, acting , film quality really stinks. Did not like it at all and feel this one was a waste of money. One of the worst low budget films I have ever seen."
1,I'm beginning to hate these kind of books,"There is no morality in politics in this country. Why does that surprise me? Because we didn't have all these cheap,disgusting ""kiss and tell"" books prior to Nixon and Clinton. If we had, John Kennedy would have been fodder for the journalist's canons. I have no respect for someone like this. And, I have even less respect for the jounalists who let these stories out, in spite of the harm they may cause to our country. They don't care!! They just want a scoopNow I see an alarming trend in the reviews by at least some of the editors here on Amazon. More and more I'm seeing Amazon editors/reviewers, blasting the Bush administration, then listing all the reviews with the most positive--five stars--first, and the lowest last, as if there were no criticisms, and everyone loved the book. STOP doing this, editors, you are stooping as low as the L.A. and N.Y. Times, and the Washington post rags.This is so obviously a vengeance book that it is not worth reading."
4,Amazingly partisan reviews here.... :),"Very well written book - two books in one - a superb account of his diplomatic life, and a good roundup of his side of current events in the Valerie Plame Affair.Only one or two slighty slowish chapters, the rest were rivetting.As for it being factual, the partisanship and vehemence of the negative reviews are astounding!I think that recent events have gone a long way to vindicating Mr. Wilson. And the future trial and possibly more indictments (there are no doubt still deals being done) will fully vindicate him.Those negative reviewers seem to be concentrating on the wrong things, and thus lose by default.Things like whether Wilson saw a particular document, or whether Cheney knew this or that, or whether his wife had a hand in sending him, are utterly irrelevant.As Joe states, this was revenge, pure and simple, and those doing it had no regard for a national security asset at all.Damn good book.... read it."
5,A faithful servant being punished for being too faithful,"The Wilson family is being punished for doing what every citizen in the USA are supposed to do: standing up for his rights, for everyone's rights. We have a right to know, or just the right to get a different view than the official.I saw him yesterday at The Daily Show. As in his book, he comes out as articulate, funny, modest, honest. He has served his country, for long, and well. And so has his wife.If this does not serve as a wake-up call, consider this: This morning it was announced that Disney is blocking the distribution of Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". They have caved in to pressure from JEB Bush.One by one we are all being silenced.When everyone is gone, who will speak out for you?"
4,Strong book overall,"The policy and diplomatic portions of the book are very interesting. It's nice to see that people can climb high in government by hard work, true grit, and taking the difficult jobs. If the accusations in the book are true, then Karl Rove should be, as Wilson said himself, rode out of town on a rail.If you are interested in foreign affairs, policy, politics, and the betrayal of a hard-working American, please read this book. However, the book seems to lack a human quality. it reads more like a policy report than a biography. It's a great book and certainly is a solid indictment of the Bush team."
1,The Politics of Lies: He Betrayed Us All,"An obvious political hatchet job on Bush to promote Kerry's Presidential candidacy and naturally, the Wilson's own retirement fund (His Gov't service retirement must be a paltry sum). If that isn't enough, it's a poorly organized work and reminds me of something that Stuart Smalley (aka Al Franken) would write. Get the cheese ready, because there is plenty of whine to go around with this one..."
1,Political drivel,"A book full of nothing more than speculation. He names names but has nothing to back it up except ""what I heard from a friend who heard from a source who'd heard it from another friend...."" His 15 minutes were over several months ago, this is a poor attempt to get back into the national media scene. Not worth $18..."
1,Discredited,"I read Wilson's book when it first appeared. I was hoping for revealing information and facts to substantiate the many charges he, Wilson, had leveled at the current administration with regard the most recent war in Iraq.I was disappointed when I found that Mr. Wilson's book, while full of invective, was very limited as to facts. Recent revelations by the British, the 9-11 Committee, and the Washington POST, have now called Mr. Wilson's few ""facts"" into serious question.Mr. Wilson, and his book, are now so discredited that any objective reader should pass on reading Mr. Wilson and seek authoritative and factual writings on the war in Iraq and the uses, and misuses, of ""intelligence"" that led to that war."
1,WHOOPS,"(...)P>Here's the short version of this book:LIES.PROVEN LIES.Oh yeah- it's badly, VERY badly written. By a pompous, smug, narcissistic, conniving democratic party operative. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME.Unless, of course, you are one of the ignorant sheep who will swallow anything that is disseminated against Bush because of your profound sense of inadequacy that is the root of your Bush hatred. Even if it turns out to be utterly false and fabricated, like this book full of animal feces."
1,Delusions of Adequacy,"Joseph Wilson was to Iraq policy what Daniel Ellsberg was to Vietnam policy. Both were often in error, but seldom in doubt. Hard to believe but Wilson makes Richard Holbrooke look introverted. Save your money and wait for the inevitable PBS program."
4,Challenging the powerful in this country takes courage.,"The prolog exhibited to much name dropping. After that his career as a diplomate in Africa was personal and engrossing. Being the senior diplomate during the first Iraq war was very interesting. To Bush Senior, he was a hero; to Bush junior, he was a goat. The part where he challenges Bush Jr policies is informative but gets tedious. There is not much about the personal effect on his wife. She of course publishes her own book 2 years later."
1,the once perfect mouse is now far from perfect...,"This used to be a well-made mouse, but not anymore. I have an older version of this mouse that I bought in August 2002, and I still use it. Unfortunately, they've changed something in how they make this mouse and it's not worth your money.I ignored the more recent reviews (which did not rate this mouse favorably) and bought another one of these mice just a couple of months ago, and already it has started to click incorrectly if my finger hits the button at certain angles. And the other day, my cursor started shaking around randomly. So I no longer recommend this product.BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,bad scrolling,"Although this mouse has great response, the scroll feature is ridiculously inept. I installed the software, as instructed, but it is of little value. When scrolling, the scroll wheel has little clicks that you can feel. Each click runs the mouse down WAY too many lines. On most pages one click takes you almost to the end of the page. There is no setting anywhere in the software to change this. If you like manually dragging the slider down to move down a page in smaller increments, then fine. Otherwise don't bother with this mouse. I wish I hadn't bought it, and since it completed a $25 free shipping order, I won't hassle with the return. I'll just end up putting it in a drawer for emergencies and will replace it next week with a better one. You get what you pay for."
2,Didnt last too long...,"This mouse stopped working after about 2months. It now doesnt turn on, there's no light coming from the mouse. I need to get a new one now."
4,Optical Wheel Mouse,I really like the mouse except the micro switch on the right click activates too easily. I am always having to clear that menu. Other wise it is an excellent item. I guess I will have to train my right center finger to use less pressure or reposition it so the right click will not activate unless intended.Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000
5,Reliable and lasting experiences.,"This MS Optical Mouse replaces my deteriorating 11 years old identical model (#D66-00069). It always has been very durable, and ergonomically comfortable. Regardless which hands I use."
5,great optical mouse,"What makes this mouse great, is it actually fits in the palm of your hand.Its a bigger mouse than the standard hp mouse, and not as contoured as the Logitech.There's no addition side buttons to bump, no battery to change.Just a straight forward reliable mouse, comfortable for hoursof CAD work without giving you hand cramps.The tail light is a bonus to show it's actually on."
5,This mouse is a TROOPER!,"Ive owned this exact mouse (but in the white color) for 5 or 6+ years and it just now as of this month is finally showing signs that its time to get a new one. Ive used this mouse for my digital art since day one and its always worked so well. I tried getting a 'fancy' new mouse, a $40 Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 with the new 'blue track' technology. But it just didn't have the same smoothness as this simple, humble little mouse. Well, my art and I arn't agreeing with said fancy mouse, so Im coming on Amazon to get another one of these guys. Never thought I'd see the day where a $40 mouse would be gathering dust while the most basic one will be the one I keep close at all times. :)"
2,Worst Mouse Ever,This is definitely the worst mouse I have ever purchased. I just bought this in March of 2005 and have had nothing but problems with it!!! It's nothing more than a true pain in the neck so I would advise against buying this item.
2,Left Button Gave Out In Less Than A Year,We have owned this mouse for less than a year and the left button is randomly firing or sometimes doesn't work at all. Very frustrating.
5,Great and Simple,Product was bought over a year ago to replace a friend of mine's wheel mouse and it's been working great since.
4,very good basic mouse; need to load driver to use with mac,"I've been using this mouse for over a month now. It's very good for the price and serves the purpose. It's a basic optical mouse with two buttons and one scroll wheel. No need to install any drivers unless you want to use it in a mac. The mac driver is horribly slow. Mac users would love the right click button, but make sure you load the microsoft driver.One annoying thing (may be just me) is the red tail light which is lit 'all' the time, even when the PC is shut down."
5,NICE,"F****** NICE MOUSE, CONFORTABLE! I LIKED A LOT! IS A NICE MOUSE FOR PLAY GAMES AND A PERFECT PERFORMANCE!I LIVE IN BRAZIL AND I LOVE THIS MOUSE (Y)"
1,You get what you pary for.,"I bought this mouse for a back up to the Microsoft Blue Optical mouse which has unfortunately been discontinued. I had used the Optical Blue mouse for years will little complaint except that I simply wore them out. After three months of use, the wheel on this mouse started being glitchy, in effect it would scroll on it's own. I was getting these ""jerky"" continued scrolls afterI would stop. Sometimes, I wouldn't even be scrolling and the screen would simply jerk. I suspected the mouse and plugged in another and realized the new mouse ""clicked"" when I used the wheel, in other words, the scroll wheel on the first mouse, like a gear, was basically stripped out and would continue to scroll regardless that I had stopped. After only a week of use, I noticed this mouse starting to do the same as the first. Accordingly, you get what you pay for. I have become increasingly dissatisfied with Mircosoft's products. If it aint broke--don't fix it."
4,"typical optical mouse, nothing special","works as described, just your typical optical mouse (not wireless)no complaints, but if you're looking for a really great mouse you're in the wrong place"
3,POLTERGEIST ACTIVITY!,"I previously had a Logitech mouse that had a left button that was wore out. I hadn't used a Microsoft mouse for many years and decided to give this one a try. It is similar in size and function of the Logitech but has a far brighter red optical light...not so noticeable when being used. I installed the software included but not necessary for standard functions. Plugged it in and I was back in business. I have noticed on several occasions that while just reading a webpage, without having my hand on the mouse, that the page will scroll down by itself. I haven't tried changing any of the mouse settings but I don't think that it will make any difference...perhaps it is just poltergeist activity!"
5,A high-quality optical mouse - excellent value,"The Microsoft Wheel Optical Mouse is an excellent replacement for a conventional ('ball') mouse. I replaced two of my old mice with these and am very pleased - no more unresponsive cursors as a sign the ball needs a bit of attention! By the way, I have one mouse running under a Microsoft Windows system and the other under a Red Hat Linux system - both without any problems. If you are fearing compatibility issues, no need to worry. Everything works out of the box.This is a great mouse at a good price - and it looks slick in black."
4,"Works Well, Thanks",This mouse is cheap and comfortable enough to be an office mouse and is good enough to game with. The only downside to gamers is the fact it only has three buttons. Worth buying if on a budget.
3,About as basic as you can get,"This is the new century's version of a good, basic functioning mouse. The two buttons and scroll wheel/button combo is pretty standard for computing these days, and I personally prefer the symmetrical MS design over their ""Explorer"" mice that look like they were molded from piece of clay that a right-handed person squeezed with his/her thumb.An alternative, for a little bit more, is the Microsoft Comfort Mouse 3000, which adds a fourth, thumb button. Included with each is the IntelliPoint software which adds functionality and customization."
3,BE AWARE,"I purchased these sneakers for my wife, ordering 1/2 size larger as recommended by other reviewers. They were promptly delivered. My wife loved the looks and feel of them. Unfortunately they were too small. I returned them to seller as instructed. That is when I realized that they did not come from Amazon. I requested a larger size or refund. The seller credited my charge card minus 7.50 restocking fee. I contacted seller and told them they were not at fault for the sneakers being too small, but I should not be charged a restocking fee because they could not send me the right size. I got a ""sorry, but too bad"" reply from them. So beware, when purchasing from this seller, They do not have free return shipping."
3,Fun Looking,"I bought these shoes for the height. It wasn't until later that i read reviews saying the shoe ran small. I panicked and waited to get my shoes. Boy was i happy that they fit! They are a little hard in the front, but other wise they feel great. I've gotten a lot of compliments on them and most likely will buy more!"
4,Excellent pair of shoes,I seen a similar pair in fingerhuts catalog but and opted for the much lower price. I really like the way they feel when walking in them.
1,Look like christmas shoes,"I don't like it at all, it looks like a christmas shoes. It's look better on the net. Maybe it's not my style someone else most like it."
5,My favorite...,"These have been my favorite pair of shoes since I bought them a couple months ago. They look nothing like ""christmas shoes."" I like them because they are so versatile, and so rugged!I also think they are very comfortable for a high heel. They make me want to sit back on my heels so I'm not on the balls of my feet all the time.I've gotten tons of compliments on these!"
4,Comfortable and unique,"These shoes are very comfortable. The design is rather unique - the fabric of the shoe looks a bit worn out - it's the style, I know, but it took me a while to get used to the way it looked. They're much darker than shown in the photo and are slightly bulky in front. Still, because of their comfort and unique design, I wear them often and would recommend."
3,Really Cute,"These shoes are darker then they appear on the site and cuter then I thought as well. I have always worn size 5.5 but most times have to buy size6, witch I did in these and with inserts they fit pretty good. They are a bit tight around the toes and I think not as confortable as everyone let on. I have a few naughty monkey shoes and I would have to say that these arent the most confortable pair but like most heels you deal with for the cuteness fo the shoe."
4,Story better then the first!,"OK, First of all i was extremely dissappointed with the first one. I think the story line and lack of ideal direction in the movie made me question wes craven. This one on the other hand was much better storied and acted. Though i caution to viewers this is a really cheesy (B) movie and if you ,like me find these movies entertaining then you might like it otherwise your better off renting it for a buck at blockbuster first!"
1,Why BOTHER???,"When the first ""Hills Have Eyes"" came to my local drive in I was 18 or so. I went by myself in my VW and saw half of it. I left when the mutants stole the family's baby and were carrying it through the woods mumbling ""mmm...tender baby....mmmm"" and were going to cook and eat it. That was all I could take. It freaked me out. The film was already unpleasant and very disturbing but this scene ended it for me. I have never seen it since and don't care to. I watched part of this sequel on cable and couldn't finish it either but for a different reason...it was just plain AWFUL! Stupid to the extreme and poor on all counts. The first one was at least upsetting enough to bother me...so it must have worked on a terror level. But ""Eyes 2"" was ridiculous. I cannot recommend this at all. But if nerve wracking cruelty is your bag then see the first one. It's not really a horror movie at all ----it's just plain SICK."
1,Same as DVD,"OK, I have the laserdisc, DVD, and now the BluRay of this movie. When I saw the BluRay was coming out I thought it would be a sharp clear high quality transfer; but, it looks and sounds just like the DVD - grainy, flat, and too dark in several scenes.I think we've passed the point where BluRay is an upgrade and now it's just a new format to copy DVDs to in order to get more money out of people."
2,"Easily, one of the worst sequels ever!!!","If you haven't seen The hill's have eyes, do not bother to check on thsi one. This sequel is as bad as the worst day of your life. The movie is filled with very dumb flashback (scenes taken from the first movie) that have to explain a movie that does make any sense.He even brought back to life michael berryman's character, wich in the first movie was creepy and morbid, now is so clumsy and dumb that is not even funny. This is by the way, wes craven's weakest entry. look for the first one, a pretty good exploitation classic!!!! but this one is very very lame!"
1,The Hills Have Eyes Part 2(1985).,The movie isn't as shocking as the first and then compared to the ultra-violent Remake is like watching a disney movie.The Sequel is alot worst than Part 1.It is so boring.
2,Weakquel to a B-Movie Drive-In Classic,"Hills II, as has been said before, was an attempt to repeat the success not only of the first flick, but also of the up-and-coming Jason and Halloween franchises -- released just as the Freddie franchise was starting. Actually, the film plays well if watched right after the first, but it cannot stand on its own.It contains some of the now standard cliches of the 80s slasher flicks: the guys are immature, the women are intuitive, but discounted, and the post-adolescent sex/skinny dipping/shower scenes are de rigeur. Also, the most vulnerable character lives (this time, a pretty, but blind, young woman). Plenty of 80s hair and fashion, but lacking the suspensefulness of the first. In the original, we WANT some of the victims to be killed because they're so stupid and obnoxious. In Hills II, they're just immature."
3,One of Cravens better films,"I viewed this film several years ago, when the USA network still aired their ""Saturday Nightmares"" horror showcase. The Hills Have Eyes still lingers in my mind as one of Wes Cravens finest directoral moments. Filmed in the same cinematic vein as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this gritty slasher flick centers around a clan of monsterous cannibals and their desert exploits. From start to finish their is a dreadful feeling of tension and suspense. I gave this film three stars, which is a mid-way rating. I reserve the higher rankings only for films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Zombie. Still, its is definitely worth checking out...and a much better use of time than wearing yourself out with all those Nightmare On Elm Street sequels!"
1,here we go again...,"""The Hills Have Eyes 2"" is a poor, lame retread of ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" which was a poor, lame retread of Tobe Hooper's vastly superior ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Writer-director Wes Craven is once again responsible for this cinematic mess, where a busload of stranded idiots wander around deserted buildings aimlessly before bald-headed savage Michael Berryman and his buddies come around to slaughter them. A cut-and-paste plot stolen from the first film, and was anyone really screaming for a sequel to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in the first place?"
3,ehh it got old/boring,"the movie wouldnt have been as bad if it wasint filmed like friday the 13th because in my opinion them movies suck. it was like there was too much walking around and investigating then there was chasing , theres only one real chase scene when pluto or w/e steals the dirt bike, which is a cool scene but after that it was just them walking around being followed by random kills. and the ending was just liek teh 1st one except they get some dumbass to go into a bus for what ever reason and it blows up and hre comes runing out and falls down a well. Its a bad movie friday the 13th is better and i hate them movies."
5,the best west coast graphiti video you can buy!!!!,from stencilbombers to some of the oldest writers around this video has it all no comercials and some real good hip hop and rap music
1,Killer Gorilla,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEMTriple feature - King of Kong Island, White Pongo and Bride of the Gorilla.My kid (of 7) and I watch these old movies and enjoy them.. usually.This bunch of DVDs are in a lousy state - picture and sound wise - and you wonder why they were ever made. The quality aside, the actual movies suck much more than anything else I have ever seen. The suffer from being BORING (my daughter said).The best special effects appear on the hologram gorilla picture on the box (not that I expected a lot of special effects).I noticed it can be bought for 87 cents used. IT IS TOO MUCH.For comparison the stuff we like are Tarzan (Weissmuller), Shazam, Superman (the oldies), Flash Gordon."
3,the UN intricacies,"if political machinations are interesting to you, then this book will wholly appease. i found it too complex for the most part from an outsider's point of view."
1,copycat,"Interesting that he lifted the title from a book about the UN, (""A Dangerous Place - The United Nations as a Weapon in World Politics"") that preceded his. How original."
2,Too big,"I probably use this for the wrong purpose, but for general cooking with what I think are reasonable serving sizes, this thing is WAY too big. I end up using my $2 plastic thing from the box store. Material and workmanship are fine and the color is a little different which is nice, but I'd like it two sizes smaller."
4,memorys,this album was great it reminded me of the old days flying home to leon. this album will bring back great memorys from the old county. sergio tapia to me is a great composer and a poet like the great ruben dario.
5,Music video for Adults,Geez - what a pleasant surprise this was ! Sometimes these videos can be a big letdown - but this was very nicely done. Shawn Colvin songs are always best in there most stripped down version. In my opinion her live and acoustic versions always outshine the studio cuts - and all these songs are simply guitar and voice in some strikingly beautiful settings. What's really amazing is how good the sound is outdoors with the water and breeze - it just adds to the music. One really gets the feeling that your spying her playing the songs alone on the beach. There's also sections of the DVD that are travelogue of the trip there - those parts were ok - but I'm not sure I want to watch them a zillion times - so the DVD allows you to play just the music.
2,"Sonically very poor, not a good music DVD","The idea of filming Shawn in some beautiful settings is kind of interesting, but the reality is that recording in the wind with location equipment makes for pretty poor sound. I've had this DVD for at least a year now and I find that I never choose to put it on. I'm glad to have it, as a Colvin completist, but I can't recommend it. If you want solo Shawn, the best commercial product is the Live '88 CD.The highlight of this DVD is Shawn playing one of her songs accompanied by a bunch of island drummers. That was kind of cool. I believe this was filmed as a DirecTV music special, and it fares better in that context. As a music DVD though, there are so many better productions than this.Actually, I think the best is actually Shawn's single track on the Best Of West 54th DVD."
1,A Digital Faux Pas for Sure,I recommend a pass on this CD. Many of the tunes do not flow correctly from start to finish--instead they have a clipped section in them. April Showers is a good example--at 2:04 the song seems to back up two lines in the melody.Carolina in the Morning has a similar cut at 2:30 in the song. And there are others I just haven't spent the time confirming.A shame Prism passed this off on the public.
4,Veteran KC pianist/singer,"Nice CD by a group of solid mainstream jazz players from Kansas City. I've played the CD on my programs and listener response has been favorable. I can recommend it. Please note there are 11 songs not 4, including a nice version of ""Estate"".Jim Wilke, Jazz After Hours - Public Radio International"
4,"Great voice, greaat jazz.",I hope Luqman Hamza had recorded more CDs. I have the only two I know. I wish there were more.
1,"Ron, I want my money back","I called Ronco and thought I ordered a pocket fisherman. This thing showed up instead. First, this thing wont fit in even my biggest pocket. B, I couldnt catch a fish with this thing even if my life depended on it. Third, the box says something about ""set it and forget it"". Well, I did ""set it and forget it"" with lousy results. As I was fishing with this thing, i needed more bait. I sat this ""great invention"" by the shore while i ran to the tackle store. I got distracted by something inappropriate to discuss here and when I posted bail the next day, my $200 investment was gone. ""Set it and forget it"" is a bunch of crap.Sincerely upset,Ty"
1,Poor workmanship and quality of material. Stay away!!!,"Let me start by saying that I am an engineer by education and profession. Based on good reviews I ordered this. But I was terribly unhappy with the quality of workmanship and material used. Both were tacky at best. It includes the outer glass, the rotary ""non-stick"" bigger gears, internal bulb the outer body, the knobs for controls everything. infact when i first performed a dry run to ensure everything was working properly, there was a strong odor of burning rubber. Indications of poor electronics inside.Am I asking for a Mercedez when I paid for a for Focus? No. FOr the same price the market has a lot of options which are built like a tank. Look at Cuisinart et al.I returned it to Amazon the next day and got a refund.Great service from Amazon - Bad product from Ronco."
3,Still Using Mine after 5 years,"This is an awesome product. Very easy to use and pretty much idiot proof. Everything I cook in this comes out great; chicken pieces, whole chickens, beef roast, pork tenderloin....you name it. I have been using mine for years now and I still think its great!They reason I gave it a 3* is because the ""Non-Stick"" surfaces are NOT non-stick. Food sticks to EVERYTHING!!!! The lobster/vegetable rack is the worst. A nightmare to clean. The stuff used to coat the metal is more like a non-stick looking paint. It lasted about 4 months and it was gone. I have to use SOS Pads and a wire brush to clean my racks now. Even before the very sticky non-stick paint came off I had to soak the stuff for hours and it barely helped. Pam cooking spray didn't help either.It works like a dream.....it cleans like a bad dream."
4,CONVIENIENT & ENERGY EFFICIENT,EASY TO USE AND CLEAN UP. FOOD TASTES GREAT.GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY.WOULD RECOMMEND.
5,Good cooking ahead,This is my second Showtime Rotisserie. This replaces a one I have used for years.
2,Jigsaw with pieces missing,"I had one of these from when they first came out years ago. Love it. I normally use it 5 or 6 times a year for parties or get togethers with friends and family. The old one finally died (the little rails it sits on cracked and came off). So, I order a replacement oven. Well, it was missing the heat sheild and the insert for the steam tray. I guess I should have kept the old one until this one arrived. I had to purchase the heat shield for an additional $24 as I did not have the time to mail it back and wait and hope I got it back. Yes, you have to mail the whole thing back for a missing part. I guess that they're afraid that I was trying to steal a second heat shield. I love the product, but the service is terrible after the sale. Still never have bought a new insert for the steam tray."
5,Wife LOVES IT !,"My wife LOVE this oven.She has used it for several months now and has had great fun using it.I wondered about the Showtime name but now I understand. You do find yourself drawn to look at the cooking chickens.As a systems designer I like the simplicity of the rotating system, but also the elegant flexibility in handling two styles of rotation.Excellent product."
1,Nothing non-stick about it.,"Good idea, in theory. Terrible in execution. We cooked a rotisserie baby chicken in it... one. The entire thing got so messy and covered in chicken fat, but it's marketed as nonstick, so we though it'd be easy to clean. WRONG. All the ""nonstick"" pieces had to be soaked and scrubbed multiple times and it still had some baked on residue. For a counter-top appliance, leaving it even moderately unclean made the whole kitchen smell off. The shiny appearance in the photo is miseading - use this thing even once and it's permanently stained. Can't return it because there's nothing ""wrong"" with it and we've already used it... so, we'll just have to get used to the greasy smell and the impossible cleaning."
5,I love it,I have used this and used this product and love it. You can not beat the taste of rotisserie chiken or roast beef any time and that smell just brings everyone to eat. love it!
5,bobs new toy,"I purchased this item for my husband for christmas. It is absolutely the best thing that I could have bought for him. The only problem is that when I looked at what I would be receiving in the box, I received everything but the gloves for handling. I do not know who I am to contact or if I need to call someone. If someone could please get back to me I would greatly appreciate it. Thanx."
4,"Great tasting food, but very noisy.","Have cooked whole Chicken and Pork Loin and both came out fantastic, but the unit is very noisy, and if you live in a small place, this will drive you crazy."
1,Ronco is a piece of junk,"Bought one from Walmart via the internet, it arrived busted. Went to Kmart and bought another. Got it home, and the whole chassis is bent. Will not set level, going to take it back too. Quality control is non-existent. A piece of junk for the money."
5,Gift for parents,My parents love this Rotisserie and Barbeque Oven and use it at least once a week. This is very comfortable and easy to use. All turns out tasty and juicy. They cooked chicken and fish.We're going to buy one for us.
4,"It's a ""purse"" sillies.","I bought this exact Perlina organizer several years back... so I was surprized to see it listed as a suit bag. Clearly, it is not a suit bag. However, for what it really is, it's great. I love this bag. Good organizers are hard to find and this one has served me well. As I said, I have had this bag for several years, and though it doesn't look brand new, it hardly shows any wear."
3,A little disappointed...,"I bought the First DVD, Yoga for Dummies. It was great because it had a section where she showed you each pose and then she actually gave you a full routine that you could practice to. This DVD only gives the instructional part but there is no routine to follow. And I agree with the other reviews...the pop-ups are beyond annoying. I do not think these existed on the first DVD and I am not quite sure why they were added. I like Candle Light Yoga and Crunch Fat Burning with Sara but I would not recommend this DVD due to the fact that it is basically instructional with no practice routine to go with the instructional."
3,"Good if you're a Dummy! Otherwise, average.","I received this as a gift from someone that chose it for the familiarity of the brand, against the myriad of other yoga videos available. Like many other Dummies publications, it delivers an adequate amount of information in an easy-to-understand and unsaturated fashion. While I would have preferred a better exposition of the principles involved, Beyond Basic Yoga for Dummies provided a fairly rigourous and rewaring yoga workout that left me with an extremely calm feeling of energy upon completion. My biggest complaint is the frequent interruptions of the trademark Dummies tips as they're very distracting, especially when you're supposed to be focusing on the movement; Ironically enough, one of the tips tells you to eliminate distractions! Sarah Ivanhoe is a great instructor, but I think that her Crunch Candlelight Yoga video far surpasses this one if you're interested in a better understanding and demonstration of Yoga."
2,Disapointed :(,"I have been praciticing yoga for about a year now. I purchased this video after about 4 months of practice and was completely bored. I couldn't even get past the first couple of segments. I found the pace slow. The first video that I bought was Crunch: Fat Burning Yoga, I loved it! I found it easy to follow and just the right amount of challenge, so I looked for other videos by Sara Ivanhoe. I purchase this and was very disapointed. For anyone with any prior yoga experience I would not recomend this, however if you are unsure of the proper way to do poses, this could be very helpful."
3,"Good for beginners, but chatty","For those new to yoga, this video provides non-threatening, carefully explained instruction. If you are beyond the beginner level, however, the pace soon becomes too slow. What's worse is that the video is, as another reviewer put it, overnarrated. There are four voice-overs during the relaxation pose alone! Since this is supposed to be the pose in which one pleasantly zones out, I found this to be very distracting."
4,just my opinion,"This video would be a five-star if not for all the extraneous blah, blah, blah. I enjoyed Sarah's instruction and easy manner, but the side-bar commentaries were a distraction. Rodney Yee is another yogi well worth your consideration."
2,I'm a beginner but way past this..,"I love Sara Ivanhoe and own some and have rented some of her other dvd's. I was real excited to get this dvd and learn some new great poses. I have just started doing Yoga and I already knew 11 of the 12 poses. I can not believe that I already knew them because they are such simple ones and this is ""beyond basic"". It is very clear and it is nice that is shows you what you could be doing wrong but I assumed I would learn the new poses in a flowing sequence. You just learn them and then hold them for 6 breaths and it's over. It is very easy to do and you could probably skip the first one. Her Crunch dvd's and 20 min workouts are better. I love the 20 min workouts."
5,bostons hot ass shit,boston is repped in this classic as krumb snatcha puts all his hits on one disc. trhis is an instant classic and its stayin in my cd player for a long time.
5,An Immense Talent,"I saw Doc Watson when he first came north and he was one of a kind then. He's gone now, but thank heaven he left us album after album of his remarkable guitar playing and singing. He was - and through albums like these - continues to be an immense talent."
3,Nice little knife...BUT...,"It is a truly small knife. It isn't meant for anything more than opening packages. The assisted opening works well, but the lock is sticky. Very sticky compared to the full sized Gerber.The biggest drawback was the knife's clip. It was so so so tight that I couldn't clip it into the pocket of a pair of jeans! I started to bend it a little to loosen it up and SNAP! the clip broke at the stress point!!! ARGH! Now I'm left with a little knife that has a sharp broken corner on it from the clip. The Torx screw is so tiny that I don't have a bit for it and it is not worth buying a special set for a $20 knife. Maybe I'll file down the sharp edges. Seriously, the clip's metal needs to be a bit more softer and not as brittle."
1,Wouldn't lock,The lock button wouldn't lock open or closed. Maybe defective or just poor design. Sent back for refund.
1,Disappointment,"I cannot express my disappointment in finding out this knife is Made in China. I thought Gerber was an American knife maker. To find out they are now just importing Chinese knives and throwing their name on it is a tremendous let down. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it, I don't want to use it, I don't even want to look at it. The worst part is I have loved Gerber knives for years and now I can't imagine wanting another one. I guess the lesson is if it doesn't tell you where it is made in the description then it is a safe bet it is Made in China."
1,Cheap,"This is a spring bound piece of junk, plastic , its an embarrassment. I will stick with my Kershaw, and put this in my junk drawer."
1,Not good,Knife would not open all the way and lock button in the way of opening sent back for refund.
2,locking mechanism is cheap,"nice blade, sturdy feel but locking mechanism is very cheap. made from plastic that gets stuck half way between lock and unlock. the bigger version of this is much better."
2,Should have stayed with Kershaw.,Knife looks nice. The spring assist does not work as well as the Kershaw speed safe. The clip was too stiff to slide on my pocket. I tried to spread the clip to loosen and the clip broke. The knife has been returned. Not sure about the blade never got a chance to use it.
4,Great little knife,"Found this knife at a yard sale, and liked it so much I had to find it online. I've been a big fan of Gerber tools for a long while, and this tool has the same quality feel to it. It is definitely a 'right hand' tool, and might be a little ackward to operate left handed.My only wish is that it had been the half serrated version, as I prefer the combination blade. The only gripe I have is the clip is a little stiff, something with a little more spring would have been handy for clipping it onto a jeans pocket.As for comments that the knife is not safe, I have to disagree. The blade release slide has a 'safe' position which prevents the knife from openning. I've had my paraframe knife with the open body get caught on fabric in my pocket, but this little guy has never openned on me."
5,Asylum of Satan: Magnificent Use Of Rubber,"Never before or since has rubber been depicted onscreen with the precise vision seen in Asylum of Satan. Satan's Children works as a dramatic character study, but if thrills are what you are looking for, or if rubber is what you're looking for, than Asylum of Satan is the movie for you. Rubber snakes and rubber spiders work for a rubber devil and try to kill virgins while men run around with mad moustaches and bell bottoms. The pace never lets up and neither does the latex.I also thought Carla Borelli was one hot babe, only surpassed by the exotic Martine.Collectively, the DVD is a classic amalgamation of all things elastic and fantastic. You won't be disappointed."
3,Hmm.,"Excellent: ""Talking to Myself""Good: ""Please Don't Cry"", ""After the Fall"", ""She Bruise Easy""So-So: ""Nothing So Bad"", ""Have You Seen Her""Bad: everything elseI loved their first album, but this one is a real crapshoot. The standout tracks ARE wonderful (especially ""Talking to Myself""--that song owns!), but the horrible half is rather a pain to hear. It's still worth checking out for the good stuff--you might just hear something amazing."
1,Counterfeit Best Of Guy Mitchell,Damn shame that we the consumer is not warned that these are re-recorded versions of Guy Mitchell's hits. These are not the Columbia Label versions with the expertise of Mitch Miller as producer. This is a clandestine English label called Prism Leisure YOU ARE WARNED they are in it for the cash. Misleading internet buyers should be a crime. DISAPPOINTED YOU BET! TIP when buying second hand or discounted CDS and you think they are a bargain check and get an assurance that they are the Original Hit Versions by the Orginal Artist or group.
4,brilliant cheerful,"been a fan for 50 years now. maybe the two tracks i can;t find on reasonably priced cd,s are hannah lee and too late. any thoughts? thanks Brian."
1,Very Disappointing,"It's called 18 Greatest Hits, but they are not the Hits. Artists that re-record their hits, rip off their fans. They are older, and they do not sound the same, as when their songs were hits."
2,Eye lift cream,It was such a small amount for the price. Not sure that it was worth it. It did come quickly and well packed so cannot complain about that.
5,Great Book!,When my neice was a baby we borrowed the same book from the library and she absolutely loved it. When I became pregnant I told myself I needed to find this book for my daughter. I looked in every book store and searched online to finally find it on amazon so cheap! My daughter is now 5 months old and loves this book. I would definately reccomend this book for babies and small children! Great buy!
2,"Please get your facts straight, Mr. Bain","The back of the cover states that the story takes place in the Berkshires. Anticipating a story set in western Massachusetts, the location of the Berkshires, I was surprised to learn that the author actually set the book in Connecticut.At the beginning of each chapter, the author asks a question about a mystery writer. One of the questions is ""which author features cats and dogs in her books? The answer is not Lilian Jackson Braun, but the author says that is the correct answer. I get very annoyed when people write books but don't bother to look up the facts. If you don't want to be factual, then use a fake setting, and don't ask questions that have real answers."
1,"Murder, She Wrote: A Question of Murder (Murder She Wrote)",Not the usual good story. Losing the Maine connection. Not very good at all. Must have changed writers ?
1,Serious Disappointment,"As a true Johnny Cash fan, I was highly disappointed in the quality of material on this album."
4,Accel Wires,"Custom wires are definately good quality and satisfied with product, but still a little tricky to get the ends on, even with grease. Tip..stretch the cap with a pen like object (I used the back end of an exacto blade holder) and grease the inside thoroughly before attempting to slide on the caps. Also recomend using a crimping tool if you dont have one or misplaced yours like I did. Crimper tabs are challenging to fit in a vise because of their thickness."
5,Really recommend,I have a closet full of exercise dvds and as I grow older I wanted something more functional in its approach. I really like this dvd. I am only in phase one of three but that automatically gives me a goal. I like the fact that the exercises are not the same old same old. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to regain a taut strong core and hates traditional floor work.
4,Hard but real results,"This dvd had enabled me to get ""cut abs"" at 45! The key is to start slow. Do what you can and progress. As you progress you will build your strength. I found myself at phase 2 before long and have been there for almost 2 months My greatest criticism is that Adam doesn't tell you how to do the exercise. Watch the video and pause as you need to. Rewind if necessary. It might take a few tries until you ""get it"". For example, the ""Reverse Crunches"" in phase 2 took me 3-4 times before I got it right. Listen to what he tells you to do. Don't rush. You'll be very happy with the results."
5,Better than expected,"I have done both Insanity and P90X workouts which both have their own ab workouts which I thought were difficult. What is interesting about this one is it didn't feel as hard during the workout but afterwards I was much sorer and got results more quickly! I think it has to do with the instability but I definitely felt it across more of the core muscles than the previous workouts.The moves can be difficult to learn and even dangerous if you don't take the time to learn to balance on the swiss ball. Once you get past that, it is a great, simple workout that produces great results!"
2,Okay,It's not what i though it would be. It is a good video for someone who is beginning to work on abs for the first time but for people who already have been working on abs for a while and have abs this is not really challenging it's way to easy.
5,Excellent advanced core workout,"First of all, I agree 100% with the review by ""zenfire"" below. This is an excellent, challenging, fast paced swiss ball workout. If you have a swiss ball and you want to learn how to use it fully, get this dvd.I am 56, exercise every day, and did not use the swiss ball prior to this year. I have done ab work, stretches, etc for many years, and I find many of the exercises presented in phases 2 and 3 of this dvd to be a real challenge, and I like that!I also have the Basics workout by Adam Ford. Abs and Core presents many more exercises, with no stretches in between, the stretches are all done at the end of the session. Also Basics is done outdoors, on the sand, Abs and Core is done indoors. The pace of Abs and Core is faster, I often need to hit the pause button to catch up, but as I improve, I need to do so less often."
3,Hits areas other than core that don't need exercise,"I know all the reviews thus far are good. So take mine with a grain of salt because I am not the most flexible person and this video calls for someone who is.I guess that's why the workout hit me in areas that were not target areas. I didn't enjoy the workout as I have others.The video itself is technically great. You can easily go to the phase or workout you want. There are three. In addition, there is an introduction that tells you about the fitness ball, sizing, etc. Very good.There is also a bonus section with added information. I wish all exercise videos were technically as well produced as this one.The workouts get right to it. No unnecessary talk. It's a bare bones workout.But I was not at all impressed. I think a very flexible person and perhaps a taller person could do these nicely. But if you're short and not too flexible, you might want to try another video."
2,Not for Beginners,"This workout is extremely hard. It requires excellent balance which I certainly do not have. I am not in terrible shape either, but i could not do the workouts at all, even the beginner workout. I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to get in the right position or balance correctly. It is not worth it for a beginner or even the average fitness person."
3,Poor Cuing and hasty Transitions,"Three workouts; phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3Cuing is poor and transitions too fast for a beginner. If you are a beginner and have never used a Swissball before expect some frustration. The video will be on the fourth repetition of the next exercise before you are ready to begin.However, the angst caused by this will fade with practice and as you memorize the video which will render cuing unecessary"
1,Ummm...can you say Impossible??,"Ok, I was really looking forward to this video because it got such rave reviews....but let me tell you. Unless you are superman and have immense strength, this video is not for you! I am an avid excersiser and think i'm fairly strong, but this video was impossible for me to do! I was in pain trying to do these impossible moves! I tried this video several times thinking i would get the hang of it, but to no avail. Please don't waste your money on this video, you will be in for a big disappointment."
1,Swiss Ball Abs and Core,Wouldn't recommend any DVD for ball exercise. Nearly important to view video and exercise especially when you doing lying exercise.
5,No More Bobs in 2004!,"No More Bobs is a funny and enjoyable look into the life of writer Madison Lawhon, who has a rather Bob-filled dating past. Take it from a Bob, no good can come of that.Madison's story opens with an appearance on a morning television program with a fat woman who speaks to animals and a voodoo doctor, and swiftly begins to add odd characters. Madison's dating history of toads suddenly means more than we think, as the fun cast begins to interact in this well-written tale.Cynthia Borris's book should be on everyone's Christmas list this year. If not remember, No More Bobs in 2004! You'll be glad you did. Believe me, I know."
2,Buy a different bow,"This is a good little crossbow BUT after I bought it, they quit making the 16"" bolts for it.I wrote to ask what a safe alternative would be and they never replied. I also wrote to ask how to restring it if the string broke or frayed and again, they never replied. They seem more interested in selling their products than giving any help after the sale.I would suggest a different manufacturer, like Parker because they answered every mail I sent, no matter how trivial my question."
3,Like the older recording better.....,"The older recording made in the 1980's has a more ""folk"" type sound to it and I much preferred that. The words and the melody are the same, some instruments were added and I feel have ruined the music. My cassette tape is near to worn out of the 1980's recording and I was trying to replace it!"
4,They were heroes,"This is a great book. It writes about a time when men needed to be real heroes, and do things that required amazing courage and fortitude, the likes of which we never see much of these days.I would have liked to have read more of the impact of the bombings on the civillian populations, but the heroes of the day make for a great read."
5,Great litlte lightweight machine,"We have a larger vacuum that didn't come with any attachmentsso needed a smaller handheld one that we could use to get intothose spaces better- like the sides of the fridge, behind it, behind theloo-sides of walls-behind sofa etc. etc. and THIS IS PERFECT...and its not heavyto hold and has a strap you can put over your shoulder to walk around with it. Plus it has all sorts of good attachments to clean with--and my hubby likes that it can vacuum out the cars etc. too..great purchase, glad we got it (and we looked a long time too)"
2,Poor design,"I bought this item based on positive reviews, paying more than comparable portable vacs. The two piece case is held together with plastic and wire latches on each side. The design of these is very flimsy. One continued to fall off the case and eventually got lost. I've now found a new use for that marvelous fix-all duct tape but it ain't pretty."
3,Good but not great,"Decent phone, especially for voice-heavy usage. Menu is fairly easy to navigate. Can customize the look. I like that you can assosiate a photo with a phone number, so when a friend or spouse calls, you see their face (or whatever you want to use for them).The camera is fair, but all cameras are fair when this model came out. Don't expect this to be a substitute for a digital camera. It's good for taking a photo in a pinch, but it's lo-res and has no flash. Memory is very sparse, too, and no expansion slots.Would prefer bluetooth, which is why I went with a V600 when my contract was up.Batteries are compatible. SIM cards are compatible."
4,v400/v500,"I have the v400 and 2 times in the last year the speaker has gone out...CellOne just unscrews the phone little screws on the screen area of the phone and air dusts it with an air duster safe for electronics...if you're desperate or daring it helps tons, but otherwise i probably wouldnt do it myself..."
3,Indiglo problems,"I, like the other reviewers, loved this watch for the time that I had it. The face is easy to read, and the blue background is very nice. The date and indiglo were the selling points for me. But exactly 10 months after buying the watch, my indiglo quit working. I thought it was the battery, but it was not. Hopefully, this will be covered by warrenty, but until then, I have switched to a similar model also available on amazon."
3,Meh,"Red Dragon was better. This one felt rushed. Lots of ""forks in the road"" presented, then left unexplored only to be breezed over at the end. Hannibal is next on my long list. Qualifier: I saw the movie about a dozen times ( I've seen all the other ones far less) growing up before I got around to reading this, which doesn't help my objectivity. Hard to get all those epic scenes with Foster and Hopkins out of my mind and see the work as a stand alone fiction. Still, if you are a fan of the series and Harris and etc., it's a must read."
4,You'll be surprised!,"I rented this movie with low expectations. It looked like the typical Z-grade movie that, if it were not for Mystery Science Theater 3000, would be a chore to watch.Boy, was I wrong!While the picture was obviously made on a low budget, it comes off much better than you'd think. The special effects are surprisingly good, especially the scenes of the experimental rocket in flight.There is some interesting stock footage of planes from the X-1 era, being launched from bombers (which at the time was how they thought they'd do rocketry).I kept wondering when the picture would start to go bad, but it kept my interest throughout. Low budget 50's sci-fi, but a real gem!"
3,sympathetic monster steals the show,"Once you get past the schmaltzy beginning, this is an interesting bit of ""mankind goes too far into the unknown and gets punished"" sci-fi. It's hard not to feel for the poor guy, after you see what he becomes! The sequence with the ""monster"" being led through the corridors by the kindly scientist on the intercom, well, it moved me as a kid and it STILL gets me a bit misty! Also, the wacky pseudo-science is quite interesting... This isn't just nostalgia, it holds up pretty well... Like a good episode of DR. WHO, the conviction of the storytelling overcomes the low budget effects..."
4,"Good, but little-known '50s sci-fi thriller","""First Man Into Space""(MGM, 1959)(Criterion reissue)---------------------------------------------This is a far-better-than-average, low-budget 1950s sci-fi thriller, a space travel story about a test pilot who becomes hideously disfigured (and apparently mutated) after a perilous, high-altitude space shot. This post-Sputnik, pre-Gagarin flick evokes the newness and mystery of space flight in the Eisenhower years, but it's also a doozy of a monster movie, with a cool costume and several death scenes that were pretty gruesome for the time. It also features a fairly taut plot, as well as a little sexual sizzle. I'd never heard of this one before the Criterion reissue... and it's pretty good! (Axton)"
2,It scared me too--42 years ago!,"I just read Doug's review of ""First Man into Space"" and I just had to write respond. I was seven years old when I saw this movie. As I recall (though my recollection here may be faulty), it was double-billed with ""Tom Thumb."" One of my good friends had a birthday party and we all went to the movies. ""First Man into Space"" scared the bejeezus out of us. We were so scared we couldn't stop crying. They had to take us out of the movie in the middle--sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper. I thus never saw its conclusion. A few years ago I found the video of the movie and I triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers. Needless to say, they made fun of me throughout the movie: ""Dad, you were scared by this?!"" :-)"
3,Decent sci-fi movie,"I found ""First Man into Space"" to be a decent sci-fi movie. The story is a little dull at times, but the actors are well cast, and the movie has good suspense. It's nothing great, but worth at least one viewing for 1950's sci-fi fans."
3,"First into space, but no award for this one.","Here's a typical 50's sci-fi movie, with Marshall Thompson playing his usual part. Nothing unusual here. If expectations are any guide, this didn't meet mine.This movie, however, suited a nation worried about atomic energy, for many movies focused on the effects of radiation. This is not a great representative of what has become a cult movement - enough to cause the rerelease of many of these low-budget classics."
5,A Tale of Two Cities,"Conway's rich, peerless adaptation of Charles Dickens's famous novel (""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"") succeeds on the merits of its lavish production design and exquisite, tone-perfect acting from the entire cast--overseen, of course, by MGM honcho David O. Selznick. Colman delivers his crowning screen performance as the cynical, boozing Carton, and when he utters the famously cathartic line ""It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done,"" only the most hardened could fail to be moved. Great support from Blanche Yurka, Basil Rathbone, and Edna May Oliver make this a sumptuous gem worth visiting again and again."
5,A Tale of Rwo Cities,"For a taste of Dickens on the screen! Classic details in black and white, a very good adaptation. I enjoyed it!"
5,"""It is the best of versions - this 1935-TALE OF TWO CITIES""","Ronald Colman is wonderful and excellent in his dignity. He bears his destiny with great emotional strength.""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times .."" This great 1935 Selznick-movie ""ist the best of versions of times ..."" Really wonderful old blakck/noir movie, some better than the good 1958 version with the fine Dirk Bogard."
5,Another rave review,"I won't say much, because it's all been said already. I just want to add that it's all true - 'the most outsanding film version of Tale of Two Cities', 'the best film adaption of any Dickens novel', 'Colman's greatest performance', 'one of the best movies ever to come out of Hollywood' etc. etc. etc. If you haven't watched it yet, you are missing one of the greatest films ever made acted by one of the greatest actors that ever lived.Watch out for any scenes where Colman is slightly inebriated - in spite of his reputation for correct and gentlemanly behaviour, he simply excels at these. Basard and Jerry provide first-class comic relief, and the seamstress - with only a few minutes of screen time - delivers one of the most moving performances I have seen.The picture and sound quality is excellent."
3,"Okay, but not great","Dickens and the French Revolution, with Ronald Coleman as the lawyer who learns the meaning of responsibility and self-sacrifice, and Blanche Yurka as Madame Defarge, who leads the storming of the Bastille. Thousands of extras were used in that sequence, though it still all looks like it occurred on the back lots of MGM (which, of course, it did). The film is okay, but it doesn't stick in the mind's eye as other Dickens films do; I guess this is also true of the novel itself."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"I had great expectations for this book. Unfortunately, it was not what I had hoped for. It is very dry, and doesn't come across as in language appropriate for the general public. I found myself disagreeing with the author throughout the book. I respect those who try alternate methods of treating ADD/ADHD. However, I think that most parents have tried everything, and that for some Ritalin has been a godsend. Of course there are many other medications now on the market, but putting my child on Ritalin three years ago made all the difference. He has his confidence back, and I believe that it will lead to a successful future. No parent wants to medicate their child, but for those who do it is not a negative thing. I found myself feeling guilty while reading this book that I had done something wrong. The last thing a parent needs is more guilt. I think the author could have been more politically correct in writing this."
3,never got through it,"My friend recommended this to me, and I began reading it about mid-way through my pregnancy. Instead of being informative, I found it very depressing! I decided to stop reading it and looked for more positive ways to address my depression, like exercise and visiting with friends. For those who enjoy lots of information and statistics, you may appreciate this book. I, however, did not find it useful."
4,Bought two,"We just purchased this storage bench for our new pool accessories. It was very easy to put together. Even my husband could do it! It is very sturdy and looks great. The storage area (5CF)was not sufficient to hold the pool accessories and the polaris without cramming, so we just bought another one for the polaris and pool toys and put it on the other side of the pool."
2,Decent for easy work load,"It looks good, considering it's plastic, but it is very uncomfortable to sit on.Assembly is weak, if you pull it a few feet it keeps falling apart (stays together though if you don't move it)Certainly can't have anything inside of any weight, the floor will start bending and giving in(I had pool supplies in it)and then dare move it a few inches...But all in all it seems to last."
3,Great 2 in 1 bench,We just purchased this storage bench for our son's outside toys. It was very easy to put together. It is very sturdy and looks great. The storage area hopefully will be large enough to fit most of his toys before the winter comes again. I am just not sure how many toys it will fit.
5,CMT + JD Album,"Sometimes reunion albums are a bit embarassing, especially if the performers' voices have faded a bit. However, the Chad Mitchell Trio sounded as great as ever, if slightly mellower, in this concert. Their distinctive sound was still there over twenty years later. John Denver fans will be disappointed that he sang on only two of the numbers, but it's a classic. I enjoyed the way he blended in as a part of the trio and didn't dominate as the ""star."""
5,MEMORY LANE,This has been a stroll down Memory Lane. What a great trio and what good music they sang. LOVE IT>
2,Some Disappointments,This could have been great and I would have paid more for the original performance with the songs done in their original order. You are NOT improving on the orginal magic!
1,"Great Book, Rotten Publisher","This book is very informative and well-written high-level view of the data warehouse, from conceptual planning to implementation. However, the publishing quality is the worst I have ever seen. The internal content of this book appears to be a cheap photocopy of a master record - text is distorted on every single page, in some cases very badly, graphs and charts are grainy and in some cases impossible to read, and the spine is flimsy at best and came apart on me after a single reading.Bottom line - the content is excellent but AVOID THIS EDITION!!"
4,Theory about Data Warehouse,"It's very good theoretical book, but sadly without practical things. If you need clear theory, then it's ok, but if you search for practical things - the best book's are from Ralph Kimball."
4,Excellent performances in a bygone style,"Perhaps my liking for this series is related to their being the first Shakespeare plays I saw as a child, on the predecessor to PBS, helping to spark a lifelong love of the playwright's work and the language in general. These black and white, highly theatrical stagings may seem strange to people today. But the actors delivery their lines with such feeling and knowledge of what they are saying that the lack of cinematic movement and naturalistic acting seems irrelevant. Highly recommended for the Shakespeare buff who wants to see excellent performances by fine actors, in a venerable style that no longer exists."
1,Don't buy this!,Dreadful picture and sound quality. Apparently this was not filmed. Like watching old video's of the Kennedy assasination.
5,The Perfect Work Gloves,"These are wonderful work gloves. They fit perfectly. I am extremely pleased with them. My gardening tasks are made a whole lot easier since I purchased these gloves. The price was very affordable. Gloves that I bought before cost a lot more, but they did not fit as well. Either they were too large and bulky and kept falling off or they were too small and uncomfortable. They are comfortably lined so that my hands are not sweaty. They wash very well. After I washed them, they still fit perfectly. I recommend them highly."
4,Transformative practices,having practiced the methods in this book for some time it is fantastic to finally to have the support here with me to use anywhere any time. I highly reccomend doing the practices in this book.
4,Valuable and to the point,This book gave a very direct approach to sound healing as it is practiced by Tibetan practitioners. I recommend this book to anyone interested in sound healing.
3,Tibetan Sound Healing,"I accept this as a true technique used by the author. I have not yet worked through it, but the information is concise and clear.One thing that strikes me is that this is a small book. Information only. Most books are full of anecdotes, and pangyric nonsense that makes them difficult to understand and too time consuming to read. He had information for a small book, so he wrote a small, honest book."
5,Yoga and the quest for the true self,"This is the most wonderful and skilful book I have ever read on yoga as it is so wonderfully truthful about yoga. Both of Stephen Cope books are a must for any true yogi, I have loved his work and his depth of insight into yoga. Stephen brings the light to the truth of yoga, which we all know can be confusing and frustrating. So thank you Stephen for clearing up the yoga monopoly and all the misunderstanding that has been evident for century in the yoga fraternity. I am so very grateful I can now hand on this wisdom of truth to my yoga students to embrace. thank you!"
2,Not Enlightenment for me...,"This book is not good for the beginning yoga guru. You need a ""speak and sound"" machine for all the yoga jargon in the book--otherwise you get caught up in the hard-to-pronounce names and words. Every couple of chapters there would be some insightful information to help you along ""your Quest"", but the final chapters tell you that you didn't need the book in the first place!"
5,It's true! Every word of it!!,"Stephen Cope has written an exquisite, moving, and totally accurate ethnography of the way it was at Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in the late 1980s and into the 1990s.Both a memoir and an intelligent, compelling discourse about the transformation of self to Self via yoga. Answers the question: Why would any lively, sentient being hie off to an ashram, monastery, or convent. Cope explores the complex psychodynamics of the spiritual journey without talking over or down to readers. His writing is positively lyrical in places.Superb Appendix provides a detailed, well-written guide to yogic practices and disciplines.You don't have to be smitten w/the Eastern-based spiritual traditions to appreciate this book. It's an essential read for anyone interested in why, when, and how people choose ""a path."""
1,Not recommended for beginners,I was very disappointed with this book. It seemed like a text book that required and Instructor to follow along. The first chapter instructed that you should read a book on processor commands and operation or at least be familiar with them before attempting to read it. (would of been nice to know before purchase)It was a waste of money to me! Couldn't even finish it. Too confusing with no help available when you got stuck! Should of read more reviews before purchasing.
4,"Good, but difficult","I'm like A-List Publishing books, but this book is difficult. Excellent code with bad cemments."
1,My kids lost interest in it.,It did not hold the interest of my children and they said it was telling them things that they could easily have found on the Internet. It seemed to lack in content.
2,Ball of Rust,"Baught a Valley Class III trailer hitch 3 years ago, and within 3 weeks it started rusting. Within 2 years it was a ball of rust. Looks real bad, and I have to file off the rust and grease it real good or the ball hitch won't fit into the trailer hitch hole. Very sorry I got this brand."
4,good towards their intended purpose,Wish I could find some that fit between the sides of the rack though.Definitely sturdy enough for just about anything you might want to put on them.
1,Parents be aware!,"This lady has a blog where she says things like that:""You might be wondering...does Heather have a boyfriend? Well, yes I do (he's a hottie, too, from my Looking for Hotties blog)"";""I like to party, drink and have a good time. Does this sound weird coming from a youth minister"" [Yes definitely];""On a retreat recently (with amazingly holy Catholic young women!) [what is a holy Catholic young woman?], I said something that shocked me - I told them I was looking for a hot guy in my life.""And this one is really shocking:Wouldn't it be great if all wedding gowns of white contained a pure vessel, ready to receive their true love for the first time - both spiritually and physically? Wouldn't it be great if every bride could honestly say, ""Fill me with everything that you are - I purely desire to receive and love you for eternity""?This girl talks by the devil to the youth!"
5,finally...the TRUTH about SEX,"This book is a gold-mine for any teen or young adult who really wants to get the most out of their relationships and to prepare themselves for that most important relationship...their future spouse. Heather and Peter adopt an easy and attractive A to Z format to make a compelling and challenging case for chastity. What gives their case a lot of clout are the many stories of real-life teens and young adults and their real struggles, their real pain at making mistakes, and their real joy in choosing a chaste lifestyle. Heather and Peter have the guts to tell us the truth about our sexuality. It is a welcome and refreshing challenge."
5,The Best Present Ever!,"I highly recommend this book not only to people who are unsure about chastity but those who already have chosen it because of its positive encouragement. Through reading this book and the personal stories, I am ready to take on the challenge of living true and full chastity. I will definitely be buying two more copies for my seventh grade male cousins!"
4,Tang Devotee,"I have prepared many of the recipes in this cookbook. It is my Thai cuisine bible and I have never prepared anything but something ( or many things)that were not rated superb by everyone at my dinner table. Tang's recipe for tom kha kai is amazing, though I cut the coconut milk ,two thirds coconut milk and one third water. I have not found a light coconut milk that is worth using. His pad thai recipe is difficult but good if done correctly and I made the Salmon with Kaffir Lime Sauce last week and it was amazing! I have other Thai and Southeast Asian cookbooks, but none compare to Tommy Tang's. I have gone to his restaurants in LA and Pasadena, and they have both been great."
1,Disapointing,"Not the quick & easy recipes from the TV show. Most are labor intensive (try deboning chicken wings!)and have 15-20 ingredients. The majority call for Tommy Tang's ""secret"" sauces, spice mixes etc. that can only be obtained at addtional cost on-line. The least useful of the 30 or so cook books I own."
1,west > east,"I feel a bit dissapointed when I tried some recipes - to me the result is more west than east . EG. I cooked Pad Thai with my own n Tang's recipe and serve to some friends. They said mine is better, Tang's has got olive oil flavour."
1,Tommy Tang's Modern Thai Cuisine,"While the recipes in this book look pretty good, I do not recommend that anyone buy it. The 50 cents + S&H; I spent was too much. Why? In several of the recipes, Mr. Tang requires 'Tommy Tang's Thai Seasoning'. However, the sources given in the back of the book where you can buy this seasoning, no longer carry it. So, is this just a hook to get you to buy it from him? For me it is. The recipes are useless if you cannot get or make the ingredients.Disappointed in the Bay Area."
1,Book Offers Nothing New,"Recently I was given ""Tommy Tang's Modern Thai Cuisine"" as a gift. After reading a few recipes from the book, I decided not to continue reading. My reasoning are outlined below.1) The recipes do not offer anything new that you cannot find on the Internet for free.2) Too many ingredients in the recipes that I am not sure would add more taste or flavor to the meal.3) I love the phrase ""Tommy's Special Sauce"" or ""Tommy's Secret Sauce"". How are you supposed to complete the recipes with such secret sauces. If you paid for the book you should be entitled to have access to those secret sauces. You are not!!!4) Some ingredients and product brands are very difficult to find even in Thai supermarkets.For these reason I mark the book as low. A one."
2,No Tangs You,"Reading this cookbook one has to wonder, is this about food, or is this about Tommy? I've eaten for several years at his restaurant (far better 10 years ago than now) and honestly, the recipes in the book are less than reproducible. There is a recipe for Tiger Roll-about as Thai as Pizza. The pictures are good, but the Tommy's tenor of 'Ain't I great and witty?' makes me gag. Sorry...give me a good recipe for a good Lemon Grass soup and you've got a devotee. I pour over Pad Thai recipes, this one just doesn't cut it. I'll eat at the restaurant (especially on Drag Night) but I won't cook from the book."
1,Cut and Paste,"This is another White Mane masterpiece.1. Neither the author nor the staff have done a full proofread. Simple grammatical and typesetting errors abound.2. The first four chapters are cobbled together from only secondary sources. In fact, Mr. Maier uses basically only the primary sources that he already used in his first two books.3. Lousy maps (a White Mane signiture.)4. Mr. Maier uses words like Rebelette to identify the pro-Confederate women of Winchester, Virginia. If he thinks he is being cute, he is not.5. I have read all three of Mr. Maier's books. He is not an entertaining, incisive, or talented writer."
1,Cheap goods,"I bought this to give as a gift but then kept it because the contents look and feel cheap. Not much of the cream product either. Overpriced for what you get. I should have sent it back, but didn't want to waste more money on the postage."
1,total workout?,"I thought I was in pretty bad shape. I tried this video and was not challenged in the least bit, I did not sweat and did not feel any kind of heat in ANY muscle. I get a better workout mopping the floor. Unless you have NEVER excercised, are recovering from a serious injury or are seriously overweight and out of shape, do not buy this."
2,Not What I Expected,"I've taken Pilates lessons for about 3 months and bought this DVD because of the reviews on Amazon.com. From my experience, this DVD doesn't show the Pilates method as a vigorous workout. I love Pilates because it really gets me going! I know everyone is different, but I enjoy moving at a good tempo. This DVD breaks down exercises so much that I have to slow up. In a way, this DVD actually interrupts my rhythm.People say that Joseph Pilates borrowed from yoga, yet I know from experience that Pilates is NOT yoga. Pilates moves faster and more dynamically, and Pilates uses extremely cool equipment."
1,Misleading,"If you are relatively familiar with true Pilates, this workout will be far too easy for you.I had been taking lessons at a Pilates studio and wanted a faster workout for days wehn I could not make it to the studio. I had only been doing Pilates for 2 months when I got this video, yet already it was much too easy. It did not present a challenge to my muscles (especially my abs, thighs and butt) and I felt the entire next day as if I had wasted my money and, more importantly, my money."
3,Too Easy,"I took some pilates classes before, but this is way too easy. The workout is pleasant, but I felt no burn at all. I would recommend this workout only to older people or to those who are new to exercising."
5,Great for on the go,"This is by far my favorite workout DVD. I have two small kids and not a lot of time to workout. This is broken down in to 4 separate 10 minute workouts (one for your butt, one for belly, one for thighs, and one total body) which are great if you don't have a lot of time. The abs one is wonderful. The first time I did it, I was feeling the burn for a couple of days later. The great thing about this is that it is hard to get bored doing it. The time goes by so fast that you really don't have time to get bored, but you still get a great workout."
5,Quick & Easy,"I read the reviews for this DVD before I'd actually purchased it and I LOVE IT! I have other yoga videos, but I love Ellen and she's a great teacher. But over the course of one week, you will definitely see results, NO JOKE. But this only comes with eating right and doing it CONSISTENTLY. I definitely recommend this and it fits into my time well, being I work full time. The reason why Pilates works is because it focuses on the smaller muscles and tones from there. This is a great video though...I'll recommend it to those who are just getting started."
5,Excellent workout,"I got this DVD for XMAS, and I love it. I don't have time to go to classes, so I needed a workout that I could do after the kids are asleep. The instruction is good, not too cheesy, and it's easy to follow. It's a subtle difference, but I appreciate that the people on the program are not all surgically made babes. It's segmented into 10 minute workouts by area (abs, butt, thighs, etc). Even better, I see results after just a few workouts."
2,Only for beginners,"Luckily I checked this out at the library as it wasnt worth my money. I have done pilates before and I noticed the instructor in the video made several mistakes, wasnt holding poses that well, and in general wasnt leading to give you a decent workout. If you are a beginner then this might be good for you to introduce you to pilates as all the moves are simple (you may have to watch first) and they do very few repeats (2 at times!!!), but if you have any experience with it I would hold out for a better video."
3,Disappointed... but great for beginners.,"I was surprised at how easy this dvd was.. this was my first pilates workout, and I thought I would be challenged with the moves. I have many cardio & toning videos that I have been using since February 2005, I am not in THAT great of shape but am getting there. I would have given this 1-2 stars based on not feeling challenged by it, but this is a pleasant video with a good instructor. I did feel relaxed afterwards, but not satisfied with the overall workout.. hope this helps."
4,Cori,"I really like this DVD. It has four specific parts: one that works abs, one that works your butt, one that works your thighs and another that works all three. I really like the abs and thights but find some of the butt work-out difficult since I have a bad back. Other than that I really enjoy this DVD."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this workout based on the great reviews - which I am frankly a little surprised at after using the dvd. I've never done a pilates class or tape but have been following a book and thought it would be good to have visual and vocal instruction. Quite frankly, this workout is ""okay"" if you are a complete beginner to any kind of exercise but not if you are already in decent shape and looking for variety to your routine.I also didn't find it in keeping with the Pilates methods that are stressed in the book I own.This one will certainly not be in my ""most used"" collection of exercise videos."
2,Not so grate : (,"I brought this workout tape bacause of all the great reviews. If you are used to another pilates method, I don't think you will like this workout. I didn't feel any kind of burn while doing the exercises. I think this would be okay for beginners."
2,Too Easy,"I haven't done pilates (or any excercise for that matter) in a long time and I am trying to get into shape for an upcoming trip. Based on all the reviews I thought this would be a good dvd to use on days when I can't make it to the gym. I was wrong, as it was way too easy. Seriously, way to easy."
3,Quick and Easy,What I like about this program is that each of the 4 sections is only 10 minutes which makes it really easy to get in a last minute work out if I am having a really busy day. The instructions are easy to follow without too much chit chat. It isn't the most challenging workout I've tried but it gets points for being so easy to fit into my day. It's a good video to do on days when you aren't looking to do a hard work out.
1,A Variation on Real Pilates,"As a studio owner and certified instructor from the New York School, I see a growing division between traditional Pilates (the way Joseph Pilates originally created his method) and variations of traditional Pilates. This DVD is a depiction of nontraditional Pilates. The exercise orders are not Joseph Pilates' original exercise orders, there is not a seamless flow between exercises, and there is music playing. Joseph Pilates did not play music because each exercises has its own rhythm, dynamic, and tempo to be determined by the instructor during a given lesson.It is important to protect the public interest by labeling products properly. Most other professions have a state licensing board to protect the public interest, but the art and practice of the Pilates method does not. To properly describe this video, perhaps video producers should call this workout a Pilates-based exercise routine."
2,Not Much Crunch.,"I own this DVD, and have used it several times. The first time I went through the entire 40 minutes and didn't feel a thing, I thought maybe it was my technique, so I got out a mirror. Nope, I looked fine (and have been told by a Pilates instructor that I have the best form she's ever seen, so it's not that I don't know what my body should be doing). Turns out it's just a wimpy workout, plain and simple. As soon as I can, I'll be ditching this one for something with more meat to it."
1,The exercises sucked!!,"If you are not experienced, then this is the perfect session for you. But I hated it. The exercises were finished before I even blinked and I didn't feel a damn thing! Don't waste your money, I wish I didn't. Hope this helps."
2,Price = Quality,"I bought this DVD because of its low price and good reviews, but I was disappointed. You definitely get what you pay for. This video seemed like a aerobics-style video without an aerobic workout. The true substance and principles of real Pilates were absent. Crunch gyms are a well know chain of workout centers, but why would they decide to market a Pilates video like this? There's an old saying ""The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."" The apple, in this case, certainly did not fall from the original Pilates tree."
1,Crunch - Pick Your Spot Pilates,"I ordered this over a month ago and still have not received it in the mail! When I got a hold of the seller, they brushed off my concerns and said that I should wait at least a month before contacting them again. I have never had to wait that long for a small package, especially one from only 3 states away."
4,very good,This video came in plenty of time and was not damaged at all and the packaging was very good so it didnt get damaged.
3,Pick your spot Pilates.,"I didn't particularly enjoy this DVD, in fact I turned it off after the beginning of the thigh workout. I felt it was too easy, and I actually didn't feel anything when doing the exercises, I also felt it was too slow. Great for beginners. I still prefer Ellen's Burn and Firm Pilates because it works both butt and thighs much better than this DVD and it's a lot more fun, fast paced cardio work out. I love Ellen, but I didn't feel this DVD did it for me."
4,Good for a Rest Day,"This DVD is good for my rest days in-between other serious workout routines (weights and cardio). It gives me a good stretch and the time flies, even though it may not stick to the original Pilates method. Better to do this then nothing at all!"
4,Crunch Pilates perfect when you're pressed for time,"I have been doing pilates on and off for about two years and recently purchased this dvd. I am pleased with the concept of the 10 minute workout because I am often to busy to exercise for longer periods. Some of the exercises are a little challenging, but nothing to bad. There are also some new exercises I haven't seen before (the frog or the mermaid). And the time goes by so fast, I can often do the whole video! Overall a very good dvd for those who understand the basic of pilates but aren't ready for advanced moves yet, enjoy!"
3,This is a good beginner workout,"I received this DVD for Christmas after asking for Windsor Pilates. I was disappointed at first but found that I really like that the abs, butt, and thigh workouts are broken down into 10 minute segments. The ab section and total body workout are my favorite. I feel like I've worked out after doing the ab section. The total body workout just gets me invigorated to continue the DVD or go for a jog. I don't feel like I get a workout with that section. The butt and thigh sections are of very little use to me. I get more from jogging three miles and it takes as much time. Ellen has a great voice and is easy to follow. The music is not annoying. I would recommend this DVD to any pilates or exercise beginner."
4,great for beginners,"great video for beginners; after using it for a couple of months, I'm ready to move on to a more challenging workout."
4,Spider King excellent,"An excellent book in Schoonover's list of historical fiction titles. If you are a fan of Maurice Druon, read this."
1,Spider King,"The Spider King is one of those exceptions to the rule. I gave up on it after only 45 pages of about 300. It's a ""biographical novel"" of Louis XI but I didn't manage to stick with the book long enough to actually learn anything new about Louis XI.I knew I was in trouble when I reached chapter two. It was nothing more than an incredibly flowery list of Louis's ancestors, visiting as ghosts as the prince is being born. It was a ham fisted way of introducing a character and the concept of the ""divine right of kings.""From there the book went on some sort of long winded tangent involving the war with England, various nobles and a child's birth keep secret from his own mother. It didn't help that the book kept throwing characters into the story without any sort of introduction; a dramatis personae or a family tree would have been useful. So after a week of having managed to read all sorts of other books rather than this ""biographical novel"" I decided to set it aside."
1,The flakiest piece of gear I've ever bought,"Funny, Toshiba still can't make a player that works well with all HD DVDs. It won't recognize ""Children Of Man"", shuts off randomly while playing ""Excalibur', takes about 3 minutes after pressing the start button to power on completely, take 30 or more seconds to respond to open/close commands. Crashes often. The remote is totally illegible, the text written in dark gray on the black remote, so if you room is dark, you'll never see the control names. Totally not ready for prime time, I'm literally shocked at how awful this player is. Haven't called Toshiba yet, but I wish I had avoided buying until they built one that works."
5,As Advertised,"This is a great player. It does a fantastic job of up converting standared dvd's. The load times are not as long as some people are reporting, and I have not noticed any problem with loud fan noise. I will say that now having both an hd and a blu ray player that blu ray movies look sharper. both players are hooked up to the same tv. I would also add that my blu ray player is a ps3. I mostly bought the Toshiba player for it's up conversion feature and to get any hd movies that I can't from blu ray. The xa2 is regarded as the premier up converting player on the market today, and I would aggree. I put in Star Wars III and was very impressed with the way it up converted to 1080p on my mitsubisi DLP. This player is the real thing."
3,"One try, bad experience.","I ordered this because I had received 1 defective HD-A35 and its replacement arrived damaged in shipment. This costs about $150 more than the A35 (depending upon Amazon's pricing at the time you order), and it is reviewed by owners as being worth it. Well, the unit I received is a substantial, good-looking piece of equipment. Built lie a tank compared to the 3rd generation HD-A35. Unfortunately, it had several problems (back-lit remote wasn't, video jumped around even on set-up menu), but the worst was cooling-fan noise. It was actually audible over normal HD-DVD listening volume. It was loud! So, I returned it and went for a 3rd try at the HD-A35... so far so good.I think my problems were probably due to the specific unit I received, so my star-rating is a bit flaky..."
3,Excellent picture BUT,"The Toshiba HD-XA2 is a product in progress. The picture quality is fantastic. The features available are very good. The play back of standard DVDs is the big reason I selected this player, and it does not disappoint.The disappointing part is this player freezes on play of HD DVDs. It seams to do this every time I start an HD DVD and varies where and when it happens. This requires a complete shutdown of the player to get out of the freeze. On restart the HD DVD will play all the way through without any problem. I have updated the player to the latest firmware version with no discernable difference, it still freezes. If Toshiba can solve this problem they have a great player. On browsing the internet I find this is a fairly common complaint. So far I am willing to put up with this aggravation but many of you might not."
3,"Great HD-DVD player, but it's too slow","The Toshiba HD-XA2 1080p HD-DVD player does provide a perfect HD-DVD signal, however the internal bootloader pisses me off every time I turn on the unit. If I wasn't already too busy with other related projects, I'd offer Toshiba free engineering resources to fix the ""boot up"" delay, or at least allow you to insert/eject a disc while the boot loader is loading up the firmware.I gave this unit only 3 stars due to the bootloader. Actually, I don't like the remote control either, but that's a minor issue probably not even worth mentioning."
2,"So close, but not ready for prime time","I really, REALLY wanted to like this player. Hell I wanted to love it. For $500, you should love your purchase.The video and sound are stunning - really they are. The problem is the performance. DVDs and HD-DVDs alike would hang. Sometimes rebooting the player would work. Sometimes the video would hang and the audio would continue. Sometimes the player would just lock up hard and I'd have to power it off/on.This player is simply not ready for the real world. I've returned mine and I'm going back to my Sony upscaling DVD player until they can get this technology stable enough that it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of a movie.I so wanted to like this player..."
3,"Good HD-DVD player, but I have to question if it's worth the extra cost",Is this really that much better than 1080i? In my opinion no.
1,Not happy with Toshiba,"This is the worst DVD player I have ever purchased!! It will not play HD DVD's without powering off from 30 to 60 minutes into to playing them. There is no warning it just powers off. I have contacted Toshiba several times, done what they have said, and sent the unit in for repair and they haven't heard of the problem and can't fix it. They sent me a brand new one and it had the same problem. Still no resulotion on the problem. I am so frustrated with a product that costs so much and doesn't work, and that the company has no idea what to do to fix the problem and all they tell me is that they have not heard of this problem before. How could I receive two different units with the same problem and no one at Toshiba has heard of it. This has really worried me about HD DVD players because now I have HD DVD's without any way to play them and hope that other HD DVD players are not the same way. This unit is supposed to be Toshiba's best HD DVD player. Well I'm not impressed!!"
2,It was used so I sent it back.,"Didn't I review this already? Mine came in its own box (not double boxed) and was used, so I sent it back. Seller ""doesn't know"" how this could have happened, and has to ""talk to the warehouse."""
2,it is way too expensive,"This is way to expensive, I bought the Hd dvd kit for my Elite 360, I will BEET anyof you who wrote me a bad review, to check out the differinces, you wont find any i am sure of that, And now that i also got a BLU RAY player. For only 299 oh it is the PS3 :). Why buy this thing for that price, it is way to expensive...when you can get a hd dvd and a blu ray player with a hdtv hdmi 3 way to hook it all together for way under that price. i mean come on my Mitsubishi HDTV 1080p was that expenive."
5,Excellent Player,"I have had absolutely NO problems with the Toshiba XA2 and am using it to display thru a projector onto a 120"" 16:9 screen. The latest firmware have not addressed all the issues related to the LFE audio 5.1 analog output but this is minor to me personally since Toshiba will eventually address this with a FW update in the future."
5,HD-DVD ROCKS!!!!!!,"I recently purchased this product from Amazon.There customer service is great.The Toshibahas an incredible picture and sound.Just watchedShooter last Wow!!!!.Very Very Satisfied.Phx, Az"
3,Toshiba HD DVD,"Great picture and sound. This is new technology and as such, it has some problems. I have spent several hours with tech support on an issue involving the unit shutting down during the play of HD DVD's for no apparent reason. This does not occur when playing regular DVD's. Tech Support is very responsive and the wait is very short but the issue has not yet been resolved. Love the product though."
4,HD-XA2 is very nice,"The good - picture quality is outstanding, the remote is fairly easy to use, set-up was very simple, updates through the ethernet connection are a breeze.The bad - slow to load video (like all I have seen so far) and no HDMI cable included (shouldn't this be standard?)"
5,first HDM player that finally has everything,"bitstreams all advanced audio codes, handles 1080p/24, Reon chip for incredible SD DVD playback. effortless firmware updates via the internet. finally a very mature player that just does what you want-play anything you put into it with no hiccups and the picture quality has to be experienced to be believed. Get this player and the Planet Earth HD DVD and you are in for a treat. and the pricing of this player right now is an incredible deal. Highly recommended."
5,very good HD player,"I am displaying on a Mitsubishi 1080p, 57 inch monitor. The Toshiba HDXA2 gives an incredible image.I took a good quality standard DVD and played it through my high end standard player--looked good. Put the same DVD into the Toshiba and it looked even better. The computer in the Toshiba XA2 gets rids of motion artifacts and mosquito noise, improving even standard DVDs. Played the standard def version of BBC PLanet Earth, then the HD version. Even better.My only caveat is that high speed playback (while searching for something) is jerky."
5,The best entertainment device in ages,"This player is a leap above everything else. I really can't begin to explain how amazing even your old DVD movies look with this player. If you have a 1080P it's a must have, especially if you don't want to have to upgrade your favorite old DVD's. The quality is amazing. Overall very impressed."
3,Too old,"Sadly, this was my favorite cologne and I didn't stop to wonder why I could no longer find it in department stores. Clinique stopped making it a while ago and the product I purchased was old. My fault, I should have known they stopped production."
4,I feel great,"Using the 200mg dosage combined with the amino acid L-tyrosine version....I've taken this before with fantastic results....Already, after only two days, I feel better when I wake up, I don't feel fuzzy, my cravings a greatly curbed and I definitly eat less. Be sure to take at bedtime as recommended, it does make you tired. If I remeber the last time I took this, the best way to use it is to take 5 days then not for 2 or for 3 weeks and not for a week, just to give yourself a rest. I am looking forward to having more energy again."
1,Sick,I started using this the day I got it. One capsule per night in combination with other supplements as recommended.I went to bed and my stomach began to hurt. It hurt all night long like I had eaten too much. I finally went to sleep. The next night I took it again and the same stomach ache happened again and each night it got worse until I couldn't sleep and was up all night. Then I started getting muscle aches and diarrhea to go along with the stomach ache. And I had such vivid dreams....I did some reading about this product and found many sites that recommend you do not take this at all until it is tested more thoroughly. This is due to the side effects.So in short I took it for one week and felt worse. I do not recommend taking this.
2,I feel like I'm going to vomit,At first these worked great. My anxiety and fears were gone... then slowly these pills started to make me feel nauseous. I stopped taking them. Then this morning I decided to take them and I FEEL HORRIBLE. I feel sick to my stomach and I feel like I'm going to vomit. Worse feeling ever. I am never taking these again.
1,Watch Out...,"Ask yourself... Why Parisi's reviews are always the first and the oldest review on hundreds of supplements, few years ahead of any other review written by anyone else and that is the same situation not for one review but for hundreds of review and all those reviews with high scores for the seller and the product itself.Majority of Parisi's reviews are set like that and even though in many of his/her reviews Parisi is reminded that his/her review is misleading in Perisis's comment section by other individuals, Parisi fails to respond or update his/her comments for some seven years. Meantime Parisi claims in many of his/her comments [I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]... No one can afford to swallow down that many supplements a day. No honest individual would let his/her review go so many years without updating such review if they are reminded by others that is misleading time after time."
5,Hard to review this type of product,"Does it do what it's supposed to? Who knows, but I trust this brand as I use other products of theirs and like them."
1,it says 100mg first then changes to 50mg,"The main title says 100 mg then when you click on it it says 50 mg, WHICH IS IT?then below it says 100 mg again wtf... not trusting this product."
1,Undigestable,"Unfortunately, I can't speak to the mental/emotional benefits or disadvantages of this product, because I couldn't even take it long enough to find out. On the third day of taking this product, I took it at night, as recommended on the packaging to prevent any drowsiness side effect, and woke up 4 hours later more nauseous than I've ever been, with a debilitating stomachache. After a few hours of stomachaches and vomiting, I felt normal again, the 5-HTP out of my system.So this product probably has some significant benefits, but be wary of GI upset. It simply didn't work for me."
3,Not sure,I've been using another brand of 5HTP and this one makes me super nauseated. I'm not sure what the difference is between the two brands. The dosage is the exact same. Probably won't buy again and may not even finish the bottle because of the sick stomach. Bummer.
3,Very little differance felt,26 yr old male using it for 4 months. taking it before bedtime. only noticed slight decrease in appetite and vivid dreams.
2,Felt Like Gallstones,"Initially, this product provided me with very vivid dreams and seemed to help with my social anxiety. But it also made me feel sick every time I took it, just low grade nausea at first that I assumed was due to something else. After the first week of taking 5-HTP, I started to feel like my gallstones were somehow back (despite having my gallbladder removed last year) -- sharp pains in my chest, a powerful urge to vomit, and a difficult time breathing. Needless to say, as soon as I stopped taking the 5-HTP I was suddenly better. I tried taking it again just to be sure, and yes, it was definitely the 5-HTP making me sick. But it seems to work great for everyone else, so perhaps I'm just weird."
3,"Dance CD, not Disco CD","Hello, there!As some other readers were mentioning, this is a CD comprising dance remixes of the classic disco tune ""Don't You Want My Love"" by Debbie Jacobs. It is a shame, though, that the original extended disco version is left out. As far as I know, this original extended disco version was only available briefly on a CD single put out by Unidisc in Canada, and I bought this CD in the hope that this version was included. Conclusively, I am a little bit dissapointed with this CD. A true collector is always interested in the original versions aside from any remixes.Regards,Carlos Alberto"
5,Thank You!,This book helped convince my husband that we could travel internationally safely. We took our first trip to Italy and carried Traveling Smart in our backpack everywhere. We will take in on all of our future trips overseas.
5,Cleveland! Whats not to like?,"Ya got the Irish Mob,the Italian Mob, Politics and a serbian PI, all set in Cleveland! Only thing better than this is the Browns in the Super Bowl (whatever that is)"
1,Not well sheilded,The cable is not well sheilded and provided a lot of feedback emitting a loud hum. Too loud to put up with. I bought a better quality cable and didn't have any hum at all.
3,This cable is not shielded,"Cable is thin, convenient to use, flexible and durable. Price is very reasonable. However this cable does not shielded so it will have some noise on low level audio. Correct use and advertisement for this cable - ""Headphones extension cable""."
2,The colorized images are attractive.,"There are 60 designs, with 16 color images on the front and back cover. The line drawings are difficult to determine the color of glass to use."
2,"Not a ""Pattern"" Book","This is not a ""pattern"" book perse... it is more of a guide book to make your own pattern if you want to use this book to create your own stain glass windows- you will have to take this to a place that will blow up the image for you. Also, you are going to have to guess the colors of many of the ""patterns"" as there is no color guide for many of the pictures in this book. 16 color photos are provided and there are 60 pages of designs. Buyer beware and be conscious of your use intended for this book. *Note: I wanted to use this book for gallery glass products and create a window design on my own windows at home. But I had to get the images blown up to size needed to accomplish this."
3,Ummmm....OOOk i guess,"One of the most messed up movies i ever bought. Truly stupid..truly weird and out there that's for sure and trust me, you'll laugh till you get to the point of ejecting it from the DVD player..or, if your bored, and i mean, really, really bored, you'll watch it right through w/o trying to fall asleep...not one of my favs. Rental at best."
2,Two really poverty row westerns.,Even the presence of Adele Jergens couldn't make this cheapie worth watching. The production values were bad even for this time of filmmaking. I wouldn't recommend this package.
2,What those three others saw in this?,"These films are very cheap and look it. One has to love B-westerns in order to like them. I have watched westerns since 1955 and believe I can rate what is good and what is not. OK, one can see some of those great western character actors in these films. It is small bonus. Lonesome Trail is a one star picture and Silver Star three star picture, maybe even a bit better. It has a good story.What should be given to Shane, Seachers, Magnicent Seven and Warlock if these are given five stars? Perhaps these are participating in an amateur contest and the ratings reflect it."
4,good effort for a first try...,"These days it's probably impossible to get a perfect groove-ambient-new agey (whatever you want to call it) album. This is no exception. While some tracks are excellent, others just fill in CD space for no reason. Maybe that's the reason why there are 17 tracks in total. That said, I think they put a fair amount of effort into this. What you get is a sound that falls somewhere in between Enigma and Mythos but with more flamenco influence. Best tracks are 1,2 and 6. I wonder what their next album will be like..."
5,ENAMOURED is perfect for that mystical journey!,"At first I was taken aback somewhat by the price tag of this great CD, but I so loved the piece I had heard on Pandora that I decided to buy it anyway. Then, when I received it I was blown away by the number of instrumentals (with some vocals) on this CD, which happens to be 17! Anytime I need to go to a ""good place"" and desire some musical help to transcend the apparent physical world, I cue up ENAMOURED, and take a metaphysical journey! Enjoy!"
1,Didn't work... my nextdoor neighbor's dog merely ignored it,"Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product.If you decide to purchase Super Bark Free, be sure it's returnable for a full refund if it doesn't live up to its claims. And in the meantime, shop around for a more effective product."
2,Under designed.,"This is a very large item for what it does not do well. It states a 25 foot reception range; I think this is a bit over-stated. It goes off at any sound, not just barking. Did not seem to work.I tried the Dog Silencer Pro from ""[...]"". Much better product. Lots smaller, has 75 foot activation range, responds to barking and has a variable output so the dogs don't get used to it. Twice the price but worth it.(Amazon: you should sell this prosuct)"
1,Lentek Super Bark Free - Ineffective,"This product was totally ineffective against my neighbor's constantly barking dog. I should have returned it for a refund, but waited too long. I do not recommend this product."
1,"ARF ARF, ARF, ARF ARF ARF, ARF ARF, ARF ARF,","The Super Bark Free Noise Deterrent does not work. Please save your money and buy a super-soaker water gun instead.If you leave the audible alert on all you hear is an annoying squeal fire off incessantly for no reason.My first unit died after a month, however, Smarthome did replace it without a squabble.The unit is not waterproof as far as I'm concerned and the garden spiders love the horn to build nest in it.The dogs will bark right next to the unit, and my 4 little monsters even knock it over if it's place near the area they love to bark."
2,Here a Woof-woof..There a Woof-woof..EVERYWHERE A WOOF-WOOF!,"i HAVE HAD THIS ITEM FOR ABOUT A MONTH.iT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS ON MY NEIGHBORING DOGS..i'VE USED IT ALL THE WAY TO MAX LIMIT.tHE DOGS NOW USE COTTON IN THEIR EARS AND IGNORE THE ""EFFECT"" BUT ALL IN ALL I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS .."
4,Great Unit,"I had it for 6 months with the optional AC power supply. The unit is angled towards the neigbor's dog, which used to bark for hours. It now stopped almost altogether. The ultrasonic mode is very useful. It does need a reset once in a while, But still I would rate it as a very good buy."
1,save your money...,"the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day...since the police won't do anything about it, i bought this bark free...hahaha...what a joke...the darn dog barked more...anyway...it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money..."
1,Super Bark Free is WORTHLESS,"Okay, read the fine print on the box. This thing only works for boredom barking, which I've never heard of. Most barking from dogs is towards people, animals and really any kind of noise. Also, superbark free is nowhere near loud enough to be effective outdoors. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BELIEVE THE FAKE REVIEWS THAT SELLERS LIST FOR THEIR OWN ITEMS. (...)"
2,Doesn't work except on audible- not for busy households,"This product worked, but only when set on the audible noise, so we had to hear the loud beep (VERY annoying sound). The ultrasound did nothing to stop the barking. Sadly, the audible was also triggered by lots of sounds besides barking. (Including me calling my kids to dinner, some TV shows and movies, doors slammed--I have teenagers <grin>. This item is simply not effective in a busy household."
1,Bark stop ... NOT,"It appears that the Lentek design (PC16) is related to the Viatek products (Bark Stop Pro ; ASIN: B0007TLYPO) - they are based on a common design by a Lentek engineer. I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer here who noted that the unit only works on the ""Audible"" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the ""Ultrasonic"" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc.This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. I've tried two different units and they both do NOT work.The negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks."
1,Does not work for Labs.,"I purchased this product to help curb my dog from barking in the yard...a habit he picked up from a couple kennel visits. I have used it for approimately three weeks, changing the height, position in the yard, and the utilizing/not utilizing the directional funnel. Although the sound seemed to annoy my lab for a second, it only lasted a second and he did not stop him or change his behavior in anyway. I do not recommend this product for stubborn barkers."
4,CHARMINGLY DISARMING READ,"I started reading She's Got Issues purely for entertainment value to learn that the message of women competing in the workplace is as timeless as it is anachronistic. Rather than helping one another get ahead, which this generation of young women entering the workforce seems to employ as a networking tactic for life, the characters Chloe and Zoe in this book must navigate treacherous Conde Nast Publishing shark-infested waters. Their stories are as opposite and hilarious as they are cautionary, based on author Stephanie Lessing's personal experience at several high profile women's magazines. Digressions into shoe fetishes, personal hygiene and side-splittingly funny conversations really make this book hard to put down. Cannot wait to read her next title, Miss Understanding, also to be published by Avon Trade."
3,"hmm, it was better than ok","I liked this book o.k. but there was way more about Michaels book, who just barely is a characater in the book. Then, suddenly it's months in the future and Chloe and Stan are quite an item but have the slept together or what?? Overall it was good and i'll defintely read the the sequel"
2,This book stinks!,"It was hard to follow and it was very difficult to muster up any kind of sympathy for the characters.I was tempted to give up and chuck the book, but I finished it. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
4,She's Got Issues,"Some chapters were a little slow, but this book is a fun read and will make you laugh!"
2,Deja Vu,"I can picture Ann Hathaway and Meryl Streep in this movie. Oh, that's right, it's already been done. Too many parallels to the original, and poor character development. Easy read, annoyingly simplistic main character."
4,LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY,"I've read some of the reviews of the people who gave this a bad rating...and while it was definetly silly, and a little ""out there"" at times, I don't think this is a book you can take too seriously. If you're looking for a fast, easy, funny read...then this is definetly it. I thought it was well written and it actually made me laugh out loud in alot of places. I completely enjoyed reading this book from start to finish."
3,"You've Come a Long Way, Baby--NOT!!","I looked forward to reading this book because it looked like a fun, lighthearted read. As I continued to read, I found that I liked Chloe Rose less and less. She was twenty-eight years old and graduated from college, but she acted more like she was twelve. Her antics (sneaking into the shoe and fashion closets during work hours to play Dress Up) got on my nerves about two-thirds of the way through the story. I finished the book because I wanted to see if her boss and the Editorial department would lynch her in the end.Here is what I enjoyed about the story: Chloe's sister, Zoe. This girl actually clear-headed and uses her brain. Through Zoe, Stephanie Lessing delivers a strong message that women shouldn't have to strive to be beauty queens or sleep A Sappy Chick their way to success. As well written as this story was, I would have enjoyed it better if it had been told in Zoe's perspective and had a different ending for her stupid, shallow sister."
1,How did this get published?????,"Weak, silly plot. Confusing, annoying characters. Poor character development. I was not sure until about the third chapter that the main character, Chloe Rose was an actual adult. At first I was under the impression that she was 1. a very young teenager or 2. mentally ill.I could not bring myself to finish this book the story was so lacking and I had absolutely no sympathy for any of it's characters."
1,Save your $$$ not worth it,Can you say Clueless? I've never read a book where the main character is so clueless that you feel stupid reading it. Like the title says - save your money for - it was not worth it.
2,a little dull,This book failed to capture my imagination and that was particularly disappointing because the subject himself has always seemed like a fascinating person.
2,Very boring book,This is a very slow read. i would not recommend it to anybody. It reads like an academic paper. it is boring!
3,Mark Twain analysis.,A book that tries to explain how and why Samuel Clemmons (Mark Twain) wrote what he did and why he wrote it. A fairly straight forward analysis that sheds some light on the authors background.
5,super detailed work,Márk Twain was a genius and a humán. This bio tells the story of án American icon in a manner that leaves this reader wanting more.
5,Silent Hills Origins,Purchased for my son.... he buys and trades and sells so many games thefirst choice is always AMAZON. Game was in good condition and as described.
4,Scary at its best!!!,"Too much to tell but I will just leave it short..... Great game and is you haven't played this one, you are cheating yourself. Way better than the (SH) that are out on the other systems now. Treat yourself and buy it,you won't regret it!"
5,I've been waiting forever!,I just love these games. I've been waiting forever for a new silent hill to come out. this game is awesome. holds the tradition of the first silent hill...spooky and scary. i'm also waiting for a new Resident Evil to come out.
4,SH: O,"This game offers an interesting view on events taking place before the first game on PSone. The graphics are very nice, comparable to PS2 graphics. The sound effects are a little on the cheesey side, but real enough to creep you out. The music is beautifully written, again, by the same composer who did the other games. My biggest issues were the camera angles and controls. They're too shifty and it's hard to see around you. I've had to fight several bosses without ever seeing the boss through the entire fight, just letting Travis auto-aim and fire.It's decent enough if you can stomach it."
4,Survival Horror Done Well,"This game reminds me of Silent Hill 2 in its graphic presentation and gameplay, and that's a good thing. The sound and other assorted atmospherics are eerie and unnerving. Movement is smooth and fluid. The combat system is pretty easy to pick up. The thing that's really different about this game is the ability to move back and forth between dimensions (the creepy Silent Hill and the regular Silent Hill) by touching mirrors. If you've seen the movie (or played the other games)then this certainly adds to the back story. If you're a survival horror fan, you can't go wrong with this title. It's one of the better PSP games out there."
4,awesome,this game is so much fun it came wrapped in a package and came just as scheduled actually even earlier thanks.
5,Silent Hill game,"This was purchased as a gift, so I can't rate the game, but I was satisfied with the product in general. It was just as ordered, shipped quickly with no problems, I would order from this seller again."
5,Great Game!!!,"I have played and finished about a dozen PSP games, and this may be my number one favorite, if not a very close second. The whole environment draws you into the dark and disturbing nature of the quest. It is the only psp game I would consider replaying. There were even moments when I actually jumped during an unexpected weird scene. Best played as suggested with headphones and with the lights out. The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible. The boss monsters are somewhat simply to defeat, but it does not effect or damage the overall gaming experience. The only downside is that it is too short. I finished in just over 10 hours. Still, I highly recommend this title to any PSP owner."
1,Worse,This game sucks. You can not skip through the story you have to sit and listen to them going on an on about whatever.
5,Writers take note!!!! Absolutely brilliant!!!,Brilliant addition to any collection. Pick up this piece of incredible art now!My highest recommendation!5 stars!
5,I was completely blown AWAY,"This anointed man of God is truly, truly blessed. I just recently got the DVD and, to say the least, I was completely blown away. This DVD has changed the way I look at Gospel music today. I am only 16 years old and I am crazy for God. I believe that Tonex was strategically placed, by God, in this time for young people. He has really touched my life in so many ways. Songs that have really made an impact on my life are Children's Bread, Spirit Realm, Make Me Over, Alive, Since Jesus Came, and Personal Jesus. My favorites are Games, Work On Me, Alive 2, or better yet, THE WHOLE DVD. Please get a copy. It will help you in more ways than one."
2,Could have done way better,"I would recommend the out of the box cd. It is way better to listen to the album than watch it. I couldnt tell if this was a Prince or Usher concert or a gospel concert. I was seriously waiting for Michael Jackson to make an appearance on the stage. The dvd has way too much self promotion on it and at the same time some sacreligious pictures like where tonex replaces Jesus and puts his face(doesnt make sense). Alot of worldy material on here too, Way too much distractions. Is he suppose to be a man of God looking and dancing like that? Looks like a rock star to me. Towards the end it was alright with Sheila E. and Kirk Franklin but could have been better. This dvd DOES NOT fit in the ""MUST HAVE"" catergory, I recommend, Israel and Newbreed ""live from another level"" or Marvin Sapp ""Dairy of a Psalmist"" those dvds are must have gospel dvds. Im not satisfied with this dvd."
5,A wonderful Ministry,After reading the reviews I felt in my heart to say something. Tonex's DVD has brought a special annoiting in my home. I did not feel that this was at all about Tonex. The ministry that has unfolded in this DVD clearly shows how God has blessed this youngman and given him many talents. Please remember what the purpose of ministry is..don't look at the person but the God that is inside them. If you've watched this DVD with a closed mind then I pray for you. My family and I will watch it over and over and continue to be blessed through the words and instruments God has given him to share with everyone. I'm only 28 but it enlightens my heart to see young people go crazy for God. We need more people that's not afraid to step OUT OF THE BOX. Get this DVD if you're not afraid of change and want to see young people on fire for the Lord!
3,Murder In The Heartland,"The cases are fine but it had no proofreading. There are numerous spelling errors, many grammer errors. It is jerky and not comfortable reading."
5,Locked Room Classic,"Carter Dickson (also known as John Dickson Carr) created another wonderful golden age locked room mystery in his novel, The Judas Window. Sir Henry Marrivale is the sleuth and he is, as always, a dependable joy. The author has surrounded him with an able cast of supporting characters to help nudge the story along. The triumph, of course, and the reason for this book's existence is the locked room crime. Carter Dickson knows how to tease the mystery and drama out of this glorious cliche, making it seem fresh and new. This is a classic from a thrilling time in mystery writing by a true master of the form. Not to be missed."
2,"Suddenly, you might think fondly of ""Hotel""","The Brits can do some brilliant comedy and great period miniseries, but the US still kicks their butt when it comes to trashy soaps like this one, a spin on the old Hotel series. The staff never seems quite sexy enough and the tawdry goings-on not quite tawdry enough. Still, better than that low-rent show about flight attendants. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
5,Great original Gibson pickguard,"This is an original Gibson replacement part. Don't ever make the mistake of changing any kind of part in your Gibson (Les Paul, SG, Explorer or any other) if not for the real deal. I have a Les Paul and I definitely intend to maintain its value in the long term by using only Gibson original parts. Besides, they look great and will perform their job for many, many years!"
3,Needs more focus and helps for homeschool teachers,"I tried to use this book to homeschool my student. Not having any knowledge of Spanish - this was not the book for us. For example, they have a writing practice on page 31 in spanish and the child is supposed to be able to read it. However, they don't give you the translation in English. Since I can't read or correctly pronounce Spanish - well, let's say we were both in the dark. I would recommend this book if you can read, write and talk in spanish."
3,"Good idea, needs more explanations","I like the idea behind this book, but it's not real organized. If you want to supplement a classroom with a few worksheets, then this might help a little bit. I bought it to use in my private Spanish classes, and have yet to use it - it's just too specific to its own lesson plans, and not thorough enough to use as a stand-alone curriculum. Of course I'm biased, but the Flip Flop Spanish curriculum is much more concise and simple, and comes with a CD.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
5,This is definitely one to have in you R & B collection.,"Wow! What album, what a voice, what a woman. Her lyrics are deep, her voice soulful, songs are so moving! In every song I still find deeper meanings to her lyrics, her emotions. ""Usmiechnij Sie"" and ""Naucz Nas Zyc"" wow!! I love those songs.. and ""Szukac Warto"" and ""Tecza Milosci""... (this woman really loves what she does!) However the other songs are just wonderful too!Agata this is for you!! read this please: I want you to always keep on going, your music comes straight from your soul and it touches me! Lots of artists and music today doesn't touch you no more, YOU make real music! Hope you come to New York soon to perform. I'm your number 1 fan! Keep on going girl!!!"
5,Dance to the beat in Miami Heat,"Locked-down in rush hour I-95 traffic on my way to or from work, DLG comes on, I want to jump out of my car and snatch the guy next to me in his linen suit out of his 740i and dance down the aisles of traffic; wedding ring or not.Great music and a killer sound system is the only way to beat hot traffic in Miami. DLG is a must."
1,?????,"I think they might have ran out of the 10mm because in its place was 3/8. I would not recommend this product, I work out of town and order tools needed to be sent to my home where I generally pick things up one or twice a month. So, mistakes like this are not acceptable when its something that is needed."
1,Ruins studs.,"Do not buy this product. In removing 20 6mm cam cover studs, the OTC tool ruined 4 by crushing the threads. If I'd have purchased a $100 puller set rather than this one, I'd be ahead."
4,Hilarious Combination,"Jay Leno and Pat Morita. What more can I say? It is such a weird combo. The jokes are stale and the action isn't all that action-packed, but the ""cheese factor"" are enough to get 4 stars in my book. That said, you probably wouldn't watch this more than once unless you were on something."
3,"""Not Bad!""","Pat Morita and Jay Leno star in this 1989 action-comedy.A Japanese detective and a Detroit cop team up to finda stolen engine prototype. This isn't bad and Pat andJay were great together. I think ""Rush Hour"" kind ofbit off this and this dvd has decent picture andsound, but no extras. I recommend this."
1,Jay leno,"Pat morita was running high from his Karate Kid movie and leno was the guest host of Carson so together ""they made the worst movie i've ever seen""...actually, it was not the worst movie, that goes to Woody Allen's ""Shadow and Fog"" and ""the Hand Maiden's Tale"" and ""The Cook, the chef, his wife and her lover"" -- this had some merit, mostly a young, fresh faced Jay Leno, and Pat Morita who is desperately trying to act his way out from the worst written cop movie ever made...it could have ""worked"" but for some reason it didn't..."
4,Excellent if you've had some previous instruction . . .,"This is a great workout. Sometimes I do 20 minutes, sometimes 40. I have never made it all the way through. I do think that having had ""live"" power yoga instruction in the past helps. I don't know what the fuss is over Mr. Blanchard's voice. I checked it out from our Public Library and finally had to purchase one because I couldn't renew it anymore!"
1,Don't Buy this Video,"If you are looking for a flowing power yoga practice, this is NOT it. Mark Blanchard does too much of the workout to be instructive, which I think can be dangerous and half the students in the class don't know what they're doing so you can't learn from them either. And in the beginning of the video Mark talks like a normal person then during the class he switched to this horrible raspy voice that he probably thinks is sexy -- Well it's not!"
2,Not as pictured,"The charger works fine, but it's not the type show in the photo that you can interchange 2 different size connectors."
3,Mostly Non-chart Songs,"I can't find out anything about these songs in relation to Frankie Avalon, except for 'Venus' and 'Why.' The CD doesn't say if any are 'original recordings,' which I would expect it would if any are. My guess is that the total CD is made up of re-recorded, or even newly recorded songs. This CD is mostly for those who like the voice of Frankie Avalon and aren't looking for old rock n' roll hits."
4,toaster,"I have been looking for a toaster for my husbands long slices of sour dough bread. This Cuisinart toaster fits the bill. It is long but not too thick, so it doesn't take up too much counter space. My only objection is that when the outside edges of the long slice is lightly brown, the inside is not. In order to have the middle lightly brown the edges will be darker. Not ideal but O.K."
1,uneven browning. great customer support,"This is the second Cuisinart toaster we have tried. Like the other, it simply is not consistent in the amount of browning. Sometimes, the toast (or bagel) comes out with perfect browning on one side and nothing on the other. Occasionally we hit the jackpot and get good toast but we've no idea what alignment of the stars makes this happen.We bought this because our older model of this toaster worked well until it died; but something must have changed in the design or the particular one we received was defective. We simply don't know. We're trying an upscale Krupp toaster now and the initial toast seems to be doing well.On the plus side, the Amazon partner, took the toaster back with no questions asked. I love this kind of customer support."
1,This is one lousy toaster!,"The toast was black on setting 4, black and dark tan on setting 3, and dark tan and untoasted on setting 2. This is appalling performance for such an expensive toaster, and not worthy of Cuisinart."
2,Not so happy!,"Uneven toasting on both regular Toast and Frozen settings. Our old cuisinart (same type) was better and almost as fast. Not used to returning items, but should really consider it this time."
2,TERRIBLE!,"Had an older model of this Tandem 4-slice Toaster which is why I bought another one to replace it but this model doesn't work as well as the older one. It doesn't toast evenly, at times one side is toasted and the other side is not. It's an intermittent problem so if you reverse it to try and toast the other side, it burns the side that's already toasted! Cuisinart as a brand has gone down the tubes with me and will I will be very, very hesitant to purchase this brand again!"
4,Excellent toaster,Bought this one to replace our similar Cuisinart Cool-Touch 2 slice toaster that we had for probably 15 years. Like this one just as well. The ability to chose either 2-slice or 4-slice heating is a nice feature and the cool touch sides are great. Wish the depress lever was a bit wider but other controls are easy to see and use.
3,Just OK,The toaster does not cook a piece of bread equally. One side cooks darker then the other and the same side is evenly cooked. I was a little disappointed.
2,it was as bad as some of the reviews said,I figured looking at the reviews I had a 50/50 chance - it seemed equal amts of people loved or hated it. But it plainly burned the edge of the toast every time.
2,Racoon Toast,Long slice burns black on the ends and golden in the center. Doesn't Cuisinart check these products before they go out for sale? Nice features that don't matter if it can't do the one thing I ask...make decent toast!Should have gone with the more expensive (and massive) Kitchen Aid even though I would need to add counter space.
1,Toaster lasted 15 months...,"This toaster stopped working after 15 months. The warranty is basically worthless. You will spend 30 minutes on the phone trying to get someone to tell you how to collect on the warranty. Then you will need to box up the unit, take it to a UPS/FedEx store, and pay for shipping yourself -- all to get a new $60 toaster."
2,Not so wonderful,Very inconsistent toasting - would expect a five star rating with Quisinart! I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Poor Quality,"I originally ordered this toaster from Amazon, and it lasted between 63 -64 days! It is designed to be a 4 slice toaster, but the back element stopped toasting the 2 slices in the back slot position. Since it was past the warranty period of Amazon, which is 60 days, I had to contact Cuisinart to arrange for another toaster, and had to mail it back. So, Cuisinart mailed another identical toaster. However, again around the 2 month period, this toaster has also failed toasting in the back slice position. Again, I contacted Cuisinart,and requested a refund.They do not give refunds and want to exchange for another identical toaster. DO NOT BUY FROM CUISINART!!!!!!!!!!!!!I gave this toaster a rating of one star; Amazon has changed my rating to 3 stars."
1,Disappointed,Have had many products by this company over the years. This toaster is the second one in 5 months. First toaster broke in 7weeks of use. The second one burns what you toast. Unable to get it to toast anything right. I would not buy this product
4,a very decent toaster,"No complaints thus far about this toaster. It is speedy and works well. I bought it with some trepidation, however, because it last time I spent so much on a toaster (also a Cuisinart) it did not last very long (two years). I expect a toaster in this price range to have some longevity. This model was the only one that had what I wanted, though, so I took the plunge again and hope for the best."
1,Lack of quality control,"Very disappointed with the product. I've tried three of the same because I liked the 2 wide and long slots. However, i have not had one where the brownness control was properly calibrated. Even the lowest two settings produced darker than desirable results. One would think that surely a company like Cuisinart would test their products before sending them out to consumers, who(without satisfaction) in turn find it necessary to return the product having wasted time and money."
1,Worst Toaster Ever,"When our wonderful Cuisanart four-slice toaster finally died, we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk, because it seemed most similar to the old one. What a mistake!- Even on the lowest setting, this toaster burns the crust at the bottom.- It is not easy to tell if you have it set for two slices or four. With the old toaster, it was very easy to see.- The push-down slider does not move freely and sometimes has to be pushed down two or three times before it engages.- The old toaster let you select ""defrost"" and ""bagel"" at the same time. The new toaster lets you select one or the other.All in all, a big waste of money and a major disappointment."
1,Definitely NOT like the former Cuisinart toaster!,"We had worn out our old Cuisinart 4-slice toaster and replaced it with this toaster because it is the same style, same type. What a HUGE disappointment. There are 6 settings (#1 & 2 Light, #3 & 4 Medium, #5 & 6 Dark). The toaster just warms the toast on setting #1. On the next setting #2, it toasted unevenly, burning the toast because the toaster heats much hotter in the center. Our old Cuisinart toaster was extremely reliable and toasted evenly, plus the slots are large enough to toast bagels. I wish I had listened to the other reviews and bought another toaster. Save yourself some grief and hassle and buy another brand."
2,Toasts well but flunks longevity test,"Depending on what we want to toast or defrost--regular bread, pitas, or bagels--this toaster does a great job on settings one through three. HOWEVER, the heating coils in one of the slots are starting to die and I've only had the appliance for just over a year."
1,Dissapointment!,"Good name, proffesional appearance, solid feel. The accolades end here.I have tried to toast white and brown packaged bread, white bakery loaves and home baked bread with the same result. Nothing gets brown, the bread dries out. In most situations the crusts at either end of the slice burn black and the center of the slice remains white. Two or four slice settings have no bearing on the result.Observation of the heating elements shows very uneven heating, some elements not even red.Cuisinart TAN-4 Tandem 4-Slice Toaster"
2,Inconsistant toaster,"I recently bought this Cuisinart toaster, and expected it to simply toast bread. This Cuisinart toaster is the worst I have ever used, and I'm 50 years old! It is extremely inconsistant. Usually it burns the edges of the toast and under-toasts the center. Sometimes it toasts one side of the bread and not the other, and this is when I have it on the normal setting, not the bagel setting! WE have had it about 3 weeks, and I was shocked to see the 7 day return policy on unopened boxes from the company I bought it from through Amazon! I guess I assumed that all companies have a 30-90 day return policy. (Duh me)I have e mailed them and asked for a full refund. I will evaluate that company after I get a response!"
3,Unsure,"We make toast, bagels, waffles, french toast sticks almost daily...still not sure about this toaster...some days it's good/some days it burns the items, especially when using both slots...nearly impossible for small items as the prongs at the bottom catch everything--the bottom tray does not allow for those particles to be released. Also, when it pops up, it's such a strong pop, sometimes the stuff inside flies out! I would not recommend it and plan to return ours as soon as I can find a suitable replacement."
3,OK Toaster,This toaster works OK. It does not work very well though. It does not toast evenly. If you are picky about your toast forget this model. Also it is slooooooww! I make toast on the highest setting and the toast usually has to be put back in because it is just faintly brown. Perhaps because I only eat natural artisan type bread like you can get from Whole Foods. Haven't tried supermarket bread. But it works. Just poorly.
1,Doesn't do what it claims to do,"Always says HOT unless water is to cold. I think this ducky was really cheap, but I wish I would have gotten something that actually told how hot the water is even if I had to pay more."
2,Cute but useless!,"I ordered this thinking it was a great concept, however I bathed my son in water that was too cold for his liking (and mine) when trying to follow the duck. I think anything above room temperature will read as too hot and realistically that just won't work. My son loves bathtime now that I just go with what I feel is comfortable for him. I would say it's a cute toy just to have, but it doesn't even squeak!"
2,Pretty useless as a bath thermometer but rocking rubber ducky,This product is cute and interesting for my 4 month old who loves bath time. It is supposed to tell when the water is too hot for baby but reads hot even if the bath is far too cold even by touch which is why I can only give it 2 stars. For the price is a great toy. And toy is what it is. Do not expect this product to assist in bath time except to get the little ones attention.
1,ALWAYS HOT???!!,"Clearly this item doesn't work. Even in water that is barely warm, it says 'HOT' under the ducky. The font almost never changes away from white. Such a waste of money!"
3,Bad thermometer,"I agree with the other reviewer who said it's a good toy, but bad thermometer. It reads ""hot"" if the water is even tepid. Rely more on the inside of your wrist or elbow for checking the water temperature; not on the ""thermometer"" on this duck. It is a great bath TOY, though."
3,Cute but not helpful,If you are looking for something to accurately tell you if the water truly is too hot - this is NOT the product to you. I put it in water that was tepid at best but honestly somewhat cold to the wrist and the HOT still showed up. While it is cute it certainly doesn't accurately show if the water is too hot. I got one (I don't know the brand but it is a turtle) that give a digital readout that is MUCH more helpful.
1,Makes water WAY too cold!,"Unfortunately, this duck rates the water as needing to be way too cold. It's pretty much useless as anything other than a bath toy. I'm assuming this temperature gauge being off has to do with the company worrying about the liability of babies burning in warm water, but they went so far to the other end, it's not usable. I wouldn't recommend for the purpose of testing water temperature."
3,Too Cold! Now will only be used as a bath toy!,"This duck says the water is too hot all the time! Even the water I've always used for her bottle gets the too hot rating! Not so sure this is super accurate! When the temp is not too hot like the duck says, it's very cold and my daughter screams the whole time. Normally she loves to bathe and swim! Basically for us that was a $2.99 bath toy! Not good for much else, unfortunately. :("
5,rubber duckie enjoyed during bath,Duck bath toy is enjoyed by toddler during bath time. Plays with it as it floats in bath and actually makes bath time more enyoyable.
2,Says HOT Always,"It is sure a toy for my toddler, but hardly a 'HOT' meter. It says HOT for even room temperature water."
5,High quality duck!,"And cute too! Yellow, classic features, floats, smiles, all the right rubber duck stuff.Would buy again and recommend it to others."
1,Useless,"Really, Don't buy it, it's really useless. we only use it as a toy. If u want know the temperture, buy a thermometer"
1,Good for a toy,"My son likes it as a toy, but the ""HOT"" indicator turns white even when the bath is room temp. I'm going to trust my wrist to judge the temperature from now on, it's cute, but a waste of money!!"
2,"Maybe the ""Hot"" means ""Cold"".","If we let this be the judge of what's too hot in the tub, our baby would have pneumonia by now. Literally anything over 75 degrees is ""hot""."
2,Pay no mind to the temperature feature.,"As other reviewers have stated, the duck indicates ""too hot"" when the bathwater is too cold for baby to comfortably sit or lay in. You actually have a much better device for detecting temperature built right into your own body...your hand! Trust yourself more than a plastic duck. Err on the cooler side if you are still unsure, or get a simple digital kitchen thermometer and save yourself some screams at bathtime due to the barely lukewarm water you will get using this duck."
2,"Terrible thermometer, fun duck","This duck was one of the reasons my child hated baths for her first three months -- we used this duck to determine what temperature to use and against our better judgement, we followed it and shocked our child with cold water.This duck says it will turn hot at 104 degrees, but for us, it turned at water in the 80s....WAY too cold.Ignore the duck, use your judgement (when I tested what I thought was good temp water, it was right on the money).Ironically, my child LOVES this duck now -- it's her favorite bath toy by far (she literally squeals with joy when she sees it). It's great because it doesn't have any holes to collect water in and grow mold like squirting toys."
2,Mixed feelings,"I found this book that appeared very appealing to me at a first glance in a bookshop. Dolphins feel so open and loving and lately they are a good hook marketing wise. But I don't know what to say... it just feels a bit too simple to me. Maybe there are people who like this simplicity but for me I think I would like something more round and sound. It seems to be the philosophy of the author, simplicity, but it's good to differenciate between simplicity and lack of real depth. I think this author doesn't have enough capacity to write a book."
5,Beautiful!!,"This is a beautiful book, easy to read, and with great teachings and messages. It really touches us."
1,A disaster!!!,"No matter how much effort he puts into writing something decent, the author of this book has forgotten that a mature reader is not stupid. The devotion and total surrender with which his followers write the reviews would be in itself a great book, at least their love is authentic. But Suryavan is fake. All his stories, including this one, are only excuses to maintain people giving and giving money. The text doesn't show any glimpse of creativity, only trying to make a cheap hook with poor dolphins to maintain his guru status."
1,This is complete rubbish!,"Oxi-Clean is supposed to be a laundry whitener, alternative to bleach. I used the entire container and found two things.1. It never completely dissolved.2. It didn't whiten anywhere near as much as bleach.Don't waste your money. If you want a ""green"" laundry whitener, that is in my opinion far superior at whitening than bleach, try Ms. Stewart's Bluing."
5,what a joy,"i saw this first many years ago and was happy to find it on amazon.Reggae rocks and soothes like a cradle, the performances are wonderful, with very special emphasis on Ziggy Marley and Jimmy Cliff."
5,SMOKIN',I recorded this on VHS back in 88. I've been searching for it on DVD for years ! SO happy to find it....I think every performance is fabulous ! Can't wait to receive it in the mail
2,cheap made tractor pins,The seller is terrific but the quality of the oki printer has faded. The tractor pin guide is a hard brittle plastic and broke on first use. Don't know if it was just a bad one or all like that. We have several older ones that performed very well but the part was more flexable.
3,Very Short,"The singing is fine.The CD only has 11 minutes of music for its 8 songs. This is shorter than any of my old albums (vinyl to you youngsters). I bought my copy in a hardware store for 99 cents. However, you will have to decide whether 11 minutes of singing is worth the price listed on amazon."
3,Just Hang'in Out,An onteresting compilation of guy experiences while growing up in Baltimore. A guys book and great reading on the John since all the stories are short and unrelated.
4,am I missing something?,I have always thought that my copy was missing a page.On one page a character is climbing a fence and the page ends mid sentence.On the next page it begins with a new sentence.
2,STOMACH ACHES,"This stuff made my side hurt, i bought it because i heard it keeps the hair root moist and your hair growth thrives when its moist. But though it played a good part in my health my side has been hurting nonstop since i've taken them."
4,Seems good,"We are not 100% convinced of the scientific evidence, or the anecdotal evidence, behind the choline thing, but we decided to supplement for my wife during pregnancy in case it really does serve to build more of the anti-stress neurotransmitters in our baby. Sounded like it can't hurt anyway. I would seriously doubt the claims of people saying they take it and are suddenly smarter and quicker thinking than people half their age. The placebo effect is long-documented and powerful."
3,"This is not a ""How to...."" book","For beginners, this book can be a complete nightmare. It reminded me of the dreary, theory laden texts of my college days more than anything. If you want to know not just how but why SQL works like it does, then this is the book for you, and you will be very happy with it. If you're looking for a reference book to support your existing SQL knowledge, then this book can serve that purpose also. However, if you're looking for something to learn SQL from at the beginner's level, this book is not for you. It is not specific to any database, lacks examples or tutorials, and speaks at the level of someone who has SQL experience."
2,"Rather narrow in scope, and for experts only","If you are looking for a book that will take you through the SQL standard, explaining what each part means and how to use each feature, then you need to look elsewhere. If you are an expert SQL user, and interested in some of the intimate detail of the standard, for example the way time and dates work, and why they work the way they do, this may well be the book for you, but it?s still expensive for the number of pages. If you known the basics well already, and want to become a power SQL user, then I?d recommend Joe Celko's SQL for Smarties"
2,Beginners Beware ! (And more ...),"Maybe experienced database developers and administrators might find this book useful, however, in my opinion, for someone looking for an introduction to the SQL world, this is one confusing collection of printed pages with all beginning pages referencing the final ones, and vice-versa. The author does not hide his dissatisfaction with the official standard and claims that the confused nature of the book simply reflects the inconsistencies and unsettled issues in the standard itself. Well, in that case, with all due respect to standard-setter and author - I am beginning to wonder why talk about a standard at all !"
4,SQL pure,"Not a beginners book, I choose it never the less. It helped me not to use nonstandard SQL features, so that my code runs with different databases. Still there seems to be no standard of how to get data about the database engine or the table configuration, so some code seems to remain individual. The book is from a standards thinking author, which means very formalistic. One nees to like this to like this book. But anyhow, the book is very profesionally written and to recommend. One needs serveral books about the same topic anyway."
4,Complete information for specialists,"I used this book during the preparation of my thesis. For this purpose, it was sometimes too detailed and complex. I think this book will be helpfull for congenital heart specialists, since all information is included for every heart defect, very well-organized. Every chapter on a certain malformation includes the history, physical appearance, auscultation, additional investigations and a clear summary. A lot of illustrations of ECG's or x-rays and pictures clarify the text. The book is (as the title says) specifically focussed on the clinical recognition of a malformation. For other purposes, such as studying longer-term outcome, the book does not provide the information."
5,Skillfully written,"Mr. Moscow's skill in reportage is outstanding. His chronological account of the Andrea Doria tragedy is compelling, with a good balance of human and technical accounts. In 1959, it was the bible of the Andrea Doria-Stockholm collision. When I first read it years ago, I believed Mr. Moscow's explanations.Since then, new information of what really happened on July 25-26, 1956, has been studied via technology. I wish that the most recent edition of Collision Course had reviewed some of this new evidence. As an eyewitness to the historic event, and having survived it along with my family, I have researched much of the information available to nautical scientists, maritime lawyers, and survivors. Armed with the data which reveals the truth about the tragedy, I know longer believe previous explanations about what caused the collision. Nevertheless, this book makes for an interesting read because it is skillfully written.Pierette Domenica Simpson"
4,Water Around,This was a very good book. I had not known much about the accident so I purchased the book to find out more. I was surprised at how many survived and how the accident actually happened. I would read it again.
4,Antarctic...,"It is produced and directed by the same individual who produced THE ENDURANCE. This is the IMAX version so if you want to see the Antarctic, this is the one but if you want to get the Shackleton's unbelievable story, then you need to watch the documentaries by NOVA."
1,Amazon is still selling defective copies of this DVD,"My ""one star"" review is not for this video, which I have not yet viewed, but for Amazon. Despite stating that Amazon only sells corrected copies of this DVD, they are continuing to sell defective copies. Today I received four copies that do not have the blue dot below the Image logo on the back cover of the DVD. I was hoping this problem had been corrected since the gentleman who wrote that he had this same issue in March, but I guess no one at Amazon has paid attention to this problem. I just notified customer service but wanted to warn anyone who might be thinking of ordering this DVD from them."
4,Works well with 3rd graders,Purchased this dvd for presentation in a 3rd grade classroom. Had just enough detail and length to keep the kids interested. Two thumbs up!
2,Some good extra material but...,If I had not seen other movies or read several books about Ernest Shackleton then I would have trouble understanding much about this incredible story of survival from the brief treatment this 40 minutes gives it. Indeed it seems to me as if this was conceived as an add-on to the 2-hour PBS Shackleton movie which deals with the subject in much greater depth. Both movies could have been spliced together or this short movie could have been included as a freebie on the other DVD set. Personally I would not pay money for this DVD. This review is based on the IMAX movie.
3,Good...but not the best,"This is a good, overall telling of the exciting adventure of Earnest Shackleton's expedition attempt to transnavigate the South Pole. The videography is, as usual, quite spectatular.However, two other recent versions of this amazing tale are both worth mentioning. ""The Endurance - Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition"" (2000), with Liam Neeson, and PBS NOVA's ""Shackleton's Voyage of Endurance,"" (2002) with David Ogden-Stiers narrating, are both better accounts because you really get more of the in-depth impact of what did and could have gone wrong on the expedition. It is incredible that, in an era where tradegy from expedition travel was not that uncommon, the fact that all 27 men made it back alive - in such a harsh yet beautifully intriguing environment - is truly amazing. If the IMAX version captured your interest, these other two will rivet you to your chair."
2,"""Shackelton - The Greatest Survival Story ..."" is better!","41 minutes including the credits. You can not cram this story into 41 minutes. I had hoped for much more when I made the purchase. The are trailers, but no other extras and no making of. This will be the last IMAX purchase that I ever make. The NOVA version on PBS is much better.The 3 DVD set Shackelton - The greatest Survival Story of All Time has a better Shackleton documentary than this IMAX DVD. It also has an Antartica documentary which is also quite good."
4,Great fun for a five year old explorer and his dad,"A beautiful, romantic, but too short treatment of Shackleton's expedition. My son and I saw this after seeing the Discovery documentary ""The Endurance"" and after watching the Kevin Branagh film--and this order worked. From the Discovery program you get the facts, the movie (with all its flaws) was more than adequate, and then the IMAX is a gorgeous treatment that combines the period photography of expedition shutterbug Frank Hurley, stunning modern shots of the landscape, and just a judicious bit of historical re-enactment (thankfully not too much). Well done! But we're done with Shackleton for a while."
2,I can't believe this,I've had this thing for a week but I can't get the battery compartment to open. What the hell?
1,Don't waste your money,If I could give this zero stars I would. This was the cheapest made product I have ever gotten. It did not work from the get go. The mirror is not a mirror and water and steam got into the product right away. DO NOT BUY is my recommendation.
1,broken case,5 stars for the performance...product was packaged extremely well...but plastic cd case broken beyond use (holds 2 cds)....which makes me believe it was broken prior to mailing...
3,Not the original recordings,"If you are familiar with the Motorcity recordings of 1989-90, you will recognize the synthesizer and drum machine, as well as the tired old voices of the vocalists trying to reprise their prime tracks. The fine print says ""to enhance the quality of this album some tracks have been re-recorded or performed live by the original artists...."" So, if you like the Motorcity sound, have at it, but don't expect the original tracks."
4,The Diabetic's Book by June Bierman,Full of great information told in good humor. They have a great way of telling you how to cope with Diabetes in their usual amusing manner.
1,"Quality, Price and Exterior dimensions","I was unable to use the Attic Stair Insulating Cover, because it is to large to fit between normal rafters in older homes. Also I considered the quality of the item to be poor and substantially overpriced.The item cost is $89.00, and I estimate the value at about $19, and consider it a throw away item.While the interior dimensions were stated, the exterior size was not. I now have a piece of trash on my hands for disposal."
4,Dual language version great for students,"I really enjoyed having the dual language version of this book to read the German and then glance over at the English side for any words that I didn't understand rather than interrupting my reading to page through a dictionary. The book is well laid out so that each recto in one language corresponds to the verso in the other language. As for the story itself, I don't find the main character of Sinclair to be very endearing. In fact, he's so full of himself that some parts of the book are just painful to read. So would I recommend the story? Maybe not. But if you are planning to read the story and are not a Muttersprachler, this is a nice version to get."
3,"Historic for Tom Clancy, but not a best effort","This is Tom Clancy's final recording, made live in 1988. For those not familiar with the Clancy Brothers, the group formed in the mid 1950's and eventually took America and Ireland by storm during the folk boom of the 1960's with robust renditions of traditional Irish tunes; not your typical ""Danny Boy""!!! The group originally featured Tommy Makem, Liam Clancy, Paddy Clancy, and Tom Clancy. In 1969 Bobby Clancy took Tommy Makem's place in the group, and in the 1980's, Robbie O'Connell joined the group. This recording has it's moments, but it suffers from a bad sound mix which is due to recording to DAT, a medium which does not allow for mixing later on. However, some songs like 'Pub with no Beer', 'Jug of Punch', 'Master McGrath', and 'Finnegan's Wake' still come off as decent renditions, showing us fans what a great group this was."
3,croquet set,This croquet set is very cute with bright colors. The sticks are very short but that probably works well for little kids. The rope does not keep its shape too well so the ducks are not spaced apart the same distance. It is a relatively inexpensive toy and my 5 year old likes it but it is not as practical as a traditional croquet set.
3,Can't stand the taste,"This is the first time I bought blackstrap molasses, I had no idea what to expect. It tastes like licorice. I don't HATE the licorice taste but this is pretty strong stuff. I tried it straight with some raw honey and couldn't take it, tried it straight with some Apple cider vinegar, couldn't even smell it although I don't mind drinking ACV with honey. I tried it in a tea with honey (blah). I tried it straight up with some nesquik chocolate syrup and have been able to take it down.Any ohther suggestions? For now I have been taking it by the spoonful as I heard is good for a number of things, so I just hold my nose and take it as a medicine."
4,"""Lesser known treasures""","""The authors introduce travelers to lesser known treasures of Maryland and Virginia."""
5,"I loved this book so much as a kid, I stole it!","Yes I admit it. I stole this book from my daycare center when I was around 7. I loved this book and I would read it every chance I got. And now as a full grown adult and a degreed librarian, I still have that original book. The hard back spine is nearly off of it but I still have it. When I book talk this books to kids I bring out my disreputable broken copy and tell them how I felt and still feel about the adventures and freedom that I found within it's pages. My favorite line is from the last page of the chapter where Corduroy first actually talks to his uncle tooth. It goes something like this: ""As the day did dark things outside, His uncle tooth puffed on his pipe, and from the rings of smoke came mists of memory."" That may not be an exact transcription but it's darn close and is just an example of the wonderful language about a little boy, his uncle and the magic of the sea.I highly recommend this book and I wish it was still in print."
2,Not at all what I had hoped for...,"First off, this doesn't smell like Tuberose. None of the sweet, intoxicating tuberose smell I am used to, but rather a fresh, ""green"" smell. Not unpleasant, but not tuberose. It also smells a bit chemical, like this was entirely created in the lab, no natural extracts.Perhaps more importantly, the smell has no staying power. It vanished from my skin within 3 hours. That is definitely not something I expect from a perfume. Sure, a cologne or an oil, but not perfume.It also has a weird consistency for a perfume: it's slightly oily.Lastly, it came without any packaging, which makes it seem like this is a sample. There also is no ingredients list on the bottle.I'm very disappointed, and will try to return it."
3,very nice,"I love the TerraNova perfume Essences. I think the Tiare Lei scent is similar to tanning oils with that pina colada smell and coconut is the first listed ingrediance. But it also has a strong floral fragrance.rubbing your wrist on the top of the bottle then rubbing your wrists together and rubbing them on your neck or chest whichever method you use is the perfect amount of scent for any of the Essence perfumes.When you smell it close to your skin you get the coconut, when you smell it by waving your arm its very floral. I was not expecting such a floral scent. I wish I could submit a scent sample online so people could smell it.:-)"
4,Tiare lei,"I like this scent it is a mild scent, vanilla/plumeria combo. It was called the tropical gardenia but it doesn't smell anything like the terra nova gardenia. The only negative is after a few hours it fades. I love it since I cannot wear the gardenia."
2,Doesn't last very long,"While I do like the way this smells, I was a little disappointed that it doesn't last very long. I buy a lot of perfume oils because I have sensitive skin and I can't wear perfume that has alcohol in it. The advantage to oils rather than traditional perfumes is that the fragrance lasts a lot longer, but with this one, I couldn't smell it anymore after about an hour. Also, it's a bit expensive for the size, especially since it doesn't have any staying power."
3,Rain Perfume essence,"I ordered this product for my daughter as a Christmas present. It was on her wish list. Besides the fact that I had a difficult time finding it, I was stunned to see how tiny the bottle was for the price. It was almost one third the price just to ship it and it didn't even come in a gift box. The scent was nothing extraordinary. I was disappointed."
5,Excellent Gift,"I received this item as a gift and absolutely loved it. So, I not only bought one for my niece, but friends have also requested copies."
4,Monica Sobrevivira,"Her music continues to light up dance floors all over. I got this album in Spain before it came out here and it is a bit slower than the last one but still shows her powerful voice. I have a feeling that major remixes are gonna come out of this cd since most songs are slow. Sobrevivire comes in two forms, track two a slower version and the last track which is worth the cd itself. the last song just rules. That song is her best ever and if you like her dance music this song is for you. i would say to buy the cd just for that. also in the cd we have a whole bunch of slow songs, except track 4 a little up beat in spanglish. also we have a very fast tempo track 7 completely in English. And a track 9 which start slow and ends with fast music no singing. so if you want her fast stuff wait for remixed singles but get it for sobrevivire alone."
5,Monica vera pantera en libertad,"Monica ha una meravigliosa voce, profonda e sensuale nei brani lenti e romantici ma potentissima e matallica in quelli con un taglio disco..."" If you leave me now"" E' un vero peccato che non abbia prodotto molto negli ultimi anni.... In questo disco molti pezzi di ""Mina"" ma cantati magistralmente come ""ahora ahora"" e ""Sobrevivir?"". Vorrei aggiungere ? anche davvero bellissima...Comprate il DVD ""Tour Minage"" e vedrete!"
4,Great songwriting and BEAUTIFUL voice.,"I remember hearing about Monica a long time ago, but I just brushed her off as another cliché pop singer. Then I saw the video for ""sobrevivire"" and thought the song was really good, but thought her voice was INCREDIBLE. I also saw that I had been wrong to typecast her for she is far from bathetic. I commend her for being so daring. There are a couple of songs on here that annoy me, but I love the songwriting and can't get enough of her sultry voice."
3,Narration VS Music Sound Track Problems.,"Nicely filmed, good sea and island bird life coverage including the seasonal El Nino effects, BUT...the narration is often drowned out by the sound track's musical score--a fault I lay directly on the studio sound staff, sloppy mixer level management, and asleep-at-the-wheel Quality Control people. The narration overall was only ""adequate"" as the woman doing it spoke as if ""too removed/uninterested/laid back"" from what she was narrating, a weak script to read from, and spoken softly as well adding to the narration shortfall. Otherwise...this is visually a good DVD of the sea and bird life of the Cocos Islands."
5,these shirts are ok,"I got exactly what I wanted, a good 100% cotton long sleeve tee shirt to keep me warm in cool weather. I needed cotton because I work in an environment where there's a risk of fire so I can't wear synthetic fibers that would melt. I'm completely happy with the shirt, I like the fact that it does not have a tag in the back of the collar. If I remember correctly it came with a tag sewn into the side seam which I tore out easily. This shirt has a small logo on the left sleeve which I could do without but doesn't particularly bother me either."
5,My husband loved it!,"I bought three of these shirts for my husband to wear to work. He does a lot of work outside and wears a short sleeved polo shirt as a uniform. In the winter, he is often freezing! These shirts look/feel awesome under his polo and he has worn them several times by themselves. He is of average height and build and they fit well. He has a little belly and these shirts hide it well. And they're not too long, not too short. He said the fabric is nice too - it draws away the sweat. Perfect!"
3,Men's tee,"I like the tee as it is sturdy. But, I don't like the small imprinted emblem on the sleeve near the cuff as it clashes with some things I want to wear the tee with."
3,Long sleeve shirt is just....OK,"The long sleeve shirt shrunk a bit after washing and drying and is stiff and clings to you a bit unlike other similar shirts I have. It does wrinkle a bit and is just ""OK"" for the price. I probably would not go back again to buy another - I might try for a cotton/polyester blend next time."
3,"OK, but ...","Russell Athletic Long Sleeve Tees I purchased a few years ago were made of heavy (I mean heavy) material. This shirt, while nicely made, is not nearly as heavy, the most important characteristic that I wanted in my tee. The addition of a tasteful logo on the sleeve cuff is meant to compensate for the reduction in cotton fiber?"
2,Made for a Gorilla,"Either my shirt was mislabeled, or someone doesn't know how large to make ""large"" size shirt. It was so big, I just gave it to my grown son, who is much, much bigger than me."
2,Not so great!,"The ""tag"" on the arm (a small 'R' logo) melted immediately when I put these in the drier on low (as directed)and the sleeves now have this little black stuff on them that looks like melted wax. The shirts I bought were white in color, so this renders them unwearable.Aside from that the shirts were about average. Relatively thin material that looks like it might be good for 'breathing' in a hot climate but not so good if you want something warmer."
4,Quality of Tee Shirt,"I am a big Russell Tee shirt fan, I have about fifteen in my closet now. This one is great. I ordered a red tee that came with loose elastic in sleeves.. Not comfortable."
2,Russell Athletic Mens Basic Cotton Long Sleeve Shirt,"I bought this shirt because of the Russell brand of sweat shirts I previously purchased. The Russell sweat shirts are great, this shirt, however, is not well made.This shirt is not the same high quality standard of the Russell sweat shirts.Within two washes, the collar and the cuffs began to lose shape. The fit and construction of the shirt is very poor and the Russell logo on the left sleeve also began to fade.I have also purchased the Champion long sleeve shirt on Amazon at a lower price and found that it is a superior product to the Russell shirt.The Russell shirt is made of 100% cotton and is made in El Salvador.Jon Green"
4,Good Value,These shirts are a good value for the money. They're not Land's End quality but that would cost nearly twice as much. I'm happy!
3,Nice product for cold days.,Nice product. However the S&H costs were high and it took forever to receive shipment.
1,"Cheap, poorly made shirt","I have always liked buying Russell made products in the past. So, I purchased two of these shirts to see if I would like them. They are thing, poorly made shirts. You can buy better shirts for less money at Walmart and you do not have to wait for the shipment.I guess I need to stop thinking of the past and more closely examine what I purchase in the future.Russell, I am ashamed of you guys. Better to pay a bit more for a better quality product."
3,Not as heavy weight as expected,"Nice, but far thinner material than an older identical style number. I was hoping for the heavier version but these will do for light duty. Minimal shrinkage in sleeves as well as overall length and width, but they WILL shrink."
4,"Nice materials, good fit","Quality is good. Fit very comfortable. Works well as both undershirt for winter under dress shirt and separate t-shirts. After washing, Very happy with purchase."
3,Russell Athletic Men's Basic Cotton Long Sleeve Tee,Good value for the price. Size shrinks slightly and need to keep this in mind when ordering a snug fit.
3,Good long sleeve tee,"This is a good product and I only wish it also came in a ""wicking"" or moisture moving weave/style. I always buy Russell if it is available."
3,Russell long sleeve T,"Material is excellent. Since my last purchase of this product, the length has shortened up considerably. Now hard to keep tucked into my jeans. Don't buy if your over 6'. Now made in El Salvador, previously made in Mexico (I think, not sure)."
2,OK but not the best,Material is a bit thin and cuffs are a bit tight. Would reccoment Soffie from Amazon or Sams Club.
1,Flimsy Shirt,"I recently bought the Russell Athletic Long sleeve Shirt in Sam's Club and was very pleased with the shirts. They were a thick cotton ""T"" shirt of very high quality. They did not have the sizes I wanted so I went onto Amazon.com and found the shirts. I ordered the shirts and what I received was a thin (flimsy) cotton shirt of poor quality. For $12.00 you would think you would get a better product considering that in Sam's Club, you can buy the shirts for $7.00. The shirts I received are useless and will be religated to be used as rags. You would not use them when you are painting becaue the paint would come right through the fabric. Do not under any circumstance buy these shirts ."
4,Great gift,This was a Christmas gift for my brother in law. He said it was soft and fit well. He said it did not shrink when washed.
2,sized wrong,I wear xxx clothing but both Russell Athletic items were too small I barely got them on. It seems that it's sized wrong.
5,"An excellent, comfortable Tee.","I love these Russell Tee's, they are comfortable and wear well. I also like the Russell short-sleeve Tee's for the summer."
2,If you don't mind the Russell logo on the sleeve....,I hate being a walking advertisement for sporting clothes companies. So I was disappointed to see the Russell shirts I ordered all have the annoying white logo on the sleeve. Can't wear these to work...oh well.
2,Cheap Quality,I ordered these for my husband and was disappointed with the quality of this Russell Athletic T-shirt. Thought I was buying quality based on my prior experience with Russell brand tee shirts. Seems quality has taken a backseat to profit. Fabric is thin and after one washing the tee shirts fit too snugly. A few more washing and they will be ready for donation to non-profit.
3,Basic Tee,"I bought the tee to sleep in, but the texture just a little too rough for sleeping, for me. But it's a nice daytime tee. It doesn't seem to shrink in the wash, so that's a plus."
3,Not what they used to be.,I have always loved Russell shirts but my local store doesn't stock them any more. Ordered several online and was a little dissapointed. The fit was the same but not nearly as thick of a cotton as what I used to get. Delivery was quick though.
3,Well Made,"The shirt is well made, with even stitching and nice seams. The cotten is not as heavy a weight as I was expecting."
4,Must read,This is a great summary of Peter Drucker's work. I think that any manager who takes his/her work seriously should read this book.
4,Great starter Management book,"A great compilation of his great works. Great refresher course, if you have read some of his other works. Mr. Drucker has been the foundation of my business from a Management standpoint. My top 3 books would be: Post Capitalist Society, The Daily Drucker, and this book The Essential Drucker. Drucker just provides great observations. Along with Post Capitalist Society (because of his historical approach and stance on Social Responsibility), this book is a great starter book into Management."
3,"Interesting, But Not Exciting Reading","Having read ""Management Challenges for the 21st Century"" and knowing the reputation of Peter Drucker I was quite eager to read the book. Maybe it was because of the translation (I read the portuguese version) but while it provides some interesting reading, it is sometime boring, too abstract and often out of date. Nevertheless, if somebody is looking for a summary of the lifetime work of Peter Drucker then he will not be disappointed."
5,Very good introduction to Drucker,This is a good book if you are just introducing yourself to Peter Drucker. The author makes several wise selections in the excerpts he chooses especially the section on entrepreneurial strategies from Drucker's 1985 book Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
4,a surprise,This book is required reading for a class I'm taking. It is surprisingly good and easy to read.
5,Managment for people who can think outside the box,"Peter Drucker has a long, well-earned reputation for writing about management skills and practices. He writes plainly, cogently and with direct examples of his observations. It's too bad more people do not read (or if they do, do not practice) his principles: marketing is listening, not selling, and if you have listened (and responded) accordingly, the product/service will be obvious and well-received, regardless of the presumed capacity of the target to benefit from it. It's almost like management for dummies, but you DO have to listen first."
5,A' la carte for beginners in management.,"If you are interested in management/strategic thinking and if you haven't read Peter Drucker ....then ...go ...go ... and get this book. The best part of this book is that it is a collection of his writingS and it exposes you to the cross -section of Druckers philosophies and thoughts. If you get fascinated by any one particular section, you can then go and get the specific book. Peter Drucker got paid enormously for asking simple questions to company executives such as 'what is your company?', 'who is your customer?' and so on. At the end of the day, it is these simple questions and their answers that drive the management (including business management) forward. For beginners, this book will leave you as qualitatively sharper manager."
3,Not quite timeless,"Good book, contains a lot of useful advice, which is ""timeless"".However, the world has changed a lot since, and there are many better management books to read/study.This book deals a lot with processes, many of which have become obsolete today."
3,Decent read,Pretty good read for some early historical information and the context is not very complicated so the book offers a good introduction to psychiatry.
5,Love this resource!,We have always used Larry Burkett's materials. This is a tried and true method of budgeting! I love the fact that every principle is backed up in scripture!
4,Adults learning piano,"Both my wife and I have been recommending this book for many years to adults wanting to learn the piano. As part-time piano teachers, we found that the lessons progress at an very good pace for most adults. The choice of songs used in the lessons are tasteful mixing both folk and classical traditions. This book also works well for someone with some music reading background but no previous piano playing experience. This book uses the classical approach and doesn't offer instruction on specific styles like rock, jazz, blues, etc. Overall, I still think it's the best adult piano method book that I've come across so far."
3,"review for book ""Keyboard Musician""",some of the printing is not clear enough.shipping is excellent and on time.
5,hand soap,"This powdered type hand soap is an alternative to the liquid type if you chose. you will need water to get the soap to liquify though, to desolve the soap, but it does not have harsh chemicals like other hand soaps do.It cleans your hands pretty well from dirt and light grease and oil. You can purchased a dispenser for not to waste the product.And the five pound box should last a while when using the dispenser.I do recommend this product and amazon, you want be sorry."
2,Like an imitation of Glenn,"Very disappointing - I've listened to Glenn Yarbrough all my life, thanks to my parents, and love his singing and music; however this CD is hard to listen to and certainly not enjoyable. His voice is there but it's almost like a mocking of the Glenn Yarbrough style, with overly sentimental voice-overs, poor song selection and arrangements, and the result is pretty lame, sadly."
1,"Poor reception, small sensors","I found this controller to be a very poor choice. Even for the price, the quality is abysmal. The reception from the pad itself is laggy (if you can even get a connection). Lag is very bad for a game where timing is key.On top of the lag, the pad itself is very poor. The sensors in the pad are very small and you must step directly on the arrows. Definitely not a good choice for beginners. Just buy a wired controller."
2,i'll have to try again,i asked for this pad for christmas and got it. it seemed to be pretty good and at the time i added it to my wish list there was only 1 review and it was positive. many other pads had quite a few bad reviews. after only using this about 3 times the down arrow stopped working. we will be returning it and trying a new one...this time from a store that i can easily return it without shipping charges.
3,"We must remember, the writers didn't have much to go on.","When this book was written, the show was probably not even aired yet, and the authors had to go on scripts. Obviously, this one can't compare to the newer novels, in which the authors have 178 episodes of material to draw from. In light of that, I think that this was a decent one, especially for its time. I would not recommend it, however, for the new trek novel fan."
2,Slow + Boring = Lame,Slow + Boring = LameOnly read about half of it. There are far too many other Star Trek books out there to bother finishing a lame one.
2,aparece en otro lado,"Este escrito (y más!) podrá encontrarlo el lector en el LIBRO DEL ARCÁNGEL MIGUEL, que también está disponible aquí mismo en Amazon."
2,Not very useful!,"I am rather disappointed by this book. The information provided is quite rudimentary. Much of the book is dedicated to the building of a router table (a particular design). So if you are looking to buy a commericial table, don't expect to find any help here. In the routers sections, it fails to actually recommend particular routers that are good for router table use - by writing just in general terms instead of citing specific routers manufacturers. The book lacks in going in depth on the various techniques on using the router table."
4,A good book and a great shipper,The router table book will show you some tricks on how to build a table for your router and how to build some specific jigs that are very helpful.
2,Compilation of previously released live and studio tracks.,"This recording is a compilation of excerpts from Monterey Pop, Bless Its Pointed Little Head, Surrealistic Pillow, and Takes Off. Only the last cut has not been released on a mainstream recording. A more accurate subtitle might be ""Mostly Live and Previously Released '66-'68"".Songs and their sources are listed below. Titles are listed as they appear on the jacket; actual titles should be obvious.Other Side of Life, She Has Funny Cars, High Flyin' Bird, Today -- Monterey PopSomebody to Love, Plastic Fantastic Lover, 3/5 of a Mile in Ten Seconds, It's No Secret -- Bless Its Pointed Little HeadWhite Rabbit, My Best Friend -- Surrealistic PillowDon't Slip Away -- Jefferson Airplane Takes OffThis is My Life and I Like it -- I don't know the source of this. It's a clean recording of either a performance or rehearsal. I'd judge it to be late 1965/early 1966."
3,My head Is fed and I'm seeing red,"The liner notes are completely useless, and tell you absolutely nothing about the music on the disc, or the band itself. A true waste of paper and ink. How hard would it have been for them to find someone to write something even marginally interesting about the Jefferson Airplane?The only real gripe I have with the audio content is the inclusion of a few studio tracks. It seems dishonest to sell it as a ""live"" CD when ""Sorta Live"", ""Live-ish"" or ""Bogo-Live"" would be more accurate. The misrepresentation is consistent with the moronic liner notes.Hey - ""Prism Leisure Records"", whoever you are - maybe next time you'll consider just leaving the packaging blank."
3,Jefferson Airplane - 'Feed Your Head - Live 1967-1969' (SSM),"Odd, but I am almost sure that sometime back, I had purchased a bootleg CD by the very same title. Stranger even still - the disc that I got had the exact same back cover but a completely different front cover. Sound quality is so-so - more or less your typical bootleg sound, from that era anyway. Guess that 'Feed Your Head - Live' finally got the legit pressing treatment. Do keep in mind this title is pretty much for the true die-hard fans and completists only."
5,Best Ever!,My family has used this cream for 30 years and we can't find it in stores anymore! It is the best! It has a pain killer in it that works immediately and it is greaseless. I won't use Neosporin or Bacitracyn because they are so greasy! Please keep selling this!!!
4,it works,"My husband, a physician, swears by Johnson and Johnson First Aide Cream as a means of preventing infection and sealing small wounds. Having gotten several knife cuts, I can attest to its value. The first cut I got several weeks ago did not heal easily and got infected. The subsequent cuts healed almost immediately after using J&J Cream."
5,Please bring it back!!,"I, too, learned too late that this product had been discontinued. If I'd have known, I would have stocked up. I had a nasty cut on my finger about 10 days ago, and if I'd had Johnson & Johnson's First-aid Cream, within a few hours, the paid would have been completely gone, and it would have healed in a day or two. Instead, I've been putting Neosporin on it, and it keeps cracking open-- it's just as painful as it was 10 days ago! As my mom used to say, ""Nothing takes the soreness out like Johnson & Johnson's First-aid Cream."" We were never without it when I was a kid.I emailed them about a year ago when I realized it was no longer in stores. Hopefully, they will see all these reviews on Amazon and bring it back!"
5,The best First Aid Cream ever made.,"Johnson and Johnson's First Aid Cream is the best cut, itch, skin cream ever made. I don't know what we'll do without it since J&J has stopped making it. If anyone from J&J reads this please tell your management to put this product back on the market and increase the price if you have to because it's that good and millions of people relied on it being there."
5,OH NO!!! I can't believe this wonderful product is discontinued.,"I was running out of my Johnson & Johnson First Aid Cream and could not find it for sale in any of the stores around where I live so I decided to try to find it on Amazon, and boy am I upset! This is the ONLY product that helps me with healing. This stuff is amazing! I have been using it for 30 years, ever since my dad bought me a first aid kit when my kids were little and there was a tube of this stuff in it. I would be happy to pay more for it if J&J would bring it back! This is very upsetting :( My only hope is to find a tube or an old first aid kit with a tube in it for sale at some store that doesn't rotate much stock!"
5,We want it and need it!,"If Johnson and Johnson does not want to produce it, they should freely give the formula to some company that will."
2,it is what it is,you get what you pay for - the sides are not parallel and so it's only square on one side -
3,It took a lot of concentration to find this one interesting,"I have a goal to read at least one biography of every US President and this one was one of the highest rated Van Buren books on Amazon. With 3.5 star average I had a feeling it wasn't going to be great and I was right. Very tough to crawl through this highly detailed book but in the details there wasn't that much that was interesting. I'm struggling to even find anything positive to refer to in the book except it did paint a decent picture of Van Buren's personality. If you find a different book about Van Buren that is rated more than 4 stars, try that one before you spend your time on this book."
2,Disappointed,"First, thank you to all of those who took the time to submit reviews for this book! I read them all.Second I am currently reading a biography on every president. I found this book to be a disappointment, and couldn't agree with many of your opinions. Of the 612 pages, only something like 50 or so actually focused on his presidency.I thought it was poorly written, and I was lost half of the time, but maybe it was just me and my IQ of 13. The book focused more on polictics of the time, and less on Van Buren himself.I'm better, and more informed for having read it, but the book was confusing and hard to follow, I had to go to other biographical websites to get a handle on what was going on.I purchased the book on Millard Fillmore from the same series, I'll let you know what I think when I read that one. Hopfully better."
5,Potter's Field,I love listening to Ray Boltz! I can't get enough of his music. I listened to it many times and then started sharing it with my mother who also loves to listen to Ray Boltz.
3,"""Kaboyi"" missing from the soundtrack","Several of the best songs are missing. I believe the one some of the other reviewers are looking for is the track named ""Kaboyi"" aka Woodpecker by Nana. The CD it's on is 'The Thula Project - An Album of South African Lullabies', which is very rare. I hope the Duma Soundtrack will eventually be re-released with ALL of the songs on it."
4,Great Family Movie,This soundtrack is wonderful. The music is uplifting and powerful. My daughter and I love listening to it whenever we feel a little down.
2,"""When You're Falling""","Just saw Duma and loved the soundtrack. Through some really heavy research, found ""When You're Falling"" on the iTunes website. Search the store under ""Afro Celt"" and just look up the song. That is the band Peter Gabriel did the duet with. Hope that helps a bit for the key missing song from the soundtrack. I agree with the others - can't figure out why the best song from the movie was missing."
4,microfiber dish cloths,"I ordered these dish cloths over the internet because I could no longer find them in the store. The product has changed, and the cloths are thicker than they used to be. I bought them in the past because they were thin and quick-drying which reduced the opportunity for bacterial growth. The new thicker cloths take much longer to dry which increases the chance of bacterial growth."
4,The book that tricked me,It was nice but the title miss led me. I suggest changing the title I thought this book was about a wolf.From Funky~
2,Vicious,"The book started out entertaining enough, and the author(s) showed insight into the realities of the Old West, including the business of trail drives. Good characters, and humor.Then it went downhill, becoming tedious with all of the vicious murders that made the book into almost a Western caricature of mad slasher movies. When a killer keeps on with his murderous rampage and kills an entire family, I actually threw the book away. I will not read more by these people, I don't read Westerns to be depressed and, yes, BORED."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,I read the sequel to this book{A Warrior's Kiss} before I read this one and it was much better. I was really disappointed with Dylan and Genevieve's story. Ms. Moore made me hate Dylan and then had Dylan's ex-mistress{supposedly able to see the future} tell Genevieve that she was barren and Dylan believed her. In the end Dylan decided that he wanted Genevieve even if she was barren but by the end of the story I wondered why Genevieve would want him! If you are looking for a happy ending with a story that makes you feel good at the end...this is not the book for you. I ended the book feeling like I wasted my money on a story that left me feeling sad!
2,A REAL LETDOWN.,"THE CHARACTERS & PLOT LACKED DEPTH. I REALLY HATED LADY GENEVIEVE BEC. SHE IS PARTICULARLY FOOLISH, GULLIBLE AND DEPENDENT ON DYLAN FOR EVERY LITTLE DECISION! ALSO, THE DESCRIPTION OF DYLAN'S HALL DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A WELSH HOLDING. THE STORY WAS NOT COMPLETELY HOPELESS AS SOME SCENES MADE ME CRY."
5,Simply the best,"America's finest music, performed by America's best... I can honestly say that this is WORLD-CLASS. The arrangements are beautiful, and the musicians, both techinally and musically, are absolutely marvelous. I've heard these guys live and I certainly believe that they are the best."
4,Very Nice Treadmill Mat,"We just bought our first treadmill and this mat to go along with it. Our treadmill fits nicely on this mat. The mat isn't very thick, but it is sturdy and does a good job of supporting our treadmill on our carpet."
4,Useful product,Good to use for storing cocoa butter to use in candy making. Shipped fast and packaged well. Not easily breakable.
2,"So much talent, but...","I've been a real admirer of Dassin's work-- and Melina Mercouri is a force of nature, irresistable. But this movie fails at every level-- as narrative it makes no sense. And Mercouri crosses that fine line into being a Grotesque, a camp parody of herself. Many of Mercouri's lines are indistinguishable, even played over a high-end system. It's as tho' half the script was never shot and the film they had on hand was quickly thrown together into a ""movie"". So much talent involved here. A huge disappointment.When oh when will they release the DVD of ""Phaedra""--the crowning achievement in the Dassin/Mercouri output ? RR in Tucson"
4,Be your DS child's own physical therapist.,"Step by step how to guide to help you lead your child to the next level and on from there. The book starts with infancy thru/ walking; then post walking. Post walking is where our child is. We are building an obstical course-like toy to help her ""walk on uneven surfaces, up and down incline planes and balance beam skills"". Other things we are trying that we learned from this book is the importance of riding toy and challenging her to stand on one foot (like when kicking a ball). Good guide to learn a few tricks to help your 2 - 3 year old with Downs."
5,Excellent resource!,My son is 4 months old and this book has been VERY helpful in working on his head control/strength building. It takes me from the beginning and builds. I Highly recommend it.
3,Helpful for people new to this condition,"Would recommend this book for individuals (parents, teachers, therapists) who haven't had much exposure and experience interacting with children who have Down Syndrome."
1,Gross Motor,I haven't receive the order yet for this book. I've emailed twice but I haven't receive any update.Gross Motor Skills in Children With Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals (Topics in Down Syndrome Purchased on 10/02/2011)by Patricia C. Winder
1,Disappointed,"After being extremely satisfied with another Tolo product, I ordered this one and was disappointed. The girl does not fit well into the car and will frustrate a child. The button that starts the car does not always engage unless you push it several times, more frustration. And when engaged it only travels about half as far as the other tolo vehicle I purchased. I returned it for a refund and will look for something else."
3,average,works ok but does not fit the power outlet very well. easy to lose connection if bumped or shaken.
2,Be Careful,"It is a great deal I must admit but unless what ever you are using this on has the power to shut down before overcharging or has a warranty don't buy this. I used a rather cheap mp3 player with this and it burned out. Luckily I had warranty and after about 4 mp3 players I found out it was the charger. Oh and if you are thinking about saying ""but thats not an HTC phone"" well this used to be listed just as usb charger so I clicked to write a review and it linked me here. Also if it overcharges an mp3 player chances are it will do the same to a phone."
1,"BROKE AFTER USING 2 TIMES, NOT AS SHOWN","Piece of junk. First of all the item I recieved is NOT what was shown in the picture, AND....... It broke the second time I used it! My mistake was that I didn't test it out right after I received it. By the time I found these things out it was after the 30 day return period. Not a happy customer with Amazon or BargainCell. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!!"
1,Does not work with Dell Axim,"Make sure you read the support issues on this card, and preferably call Tech support to see if there are known issues with your pocket PC before you buy this card. I bought this card for my Dell Axim X5 (Pocket PC 2002), and it just did not work, inspite of trying to install and uninstall thrice. Sandisk support site and customer service rep claimed that there are known issues with Dell Axim - the 128 MB memory portion does not work. He claimed that only the wireless portion should work. However, that did not work either in my case inspite of trying everything under the sun. My recommendation - stay away from this if you own a Dell Axim."
2,Doesn't work with older Windows Pocket PC and Windows CE,"Well, even though the card without the 128 meg of memory supports the older pocket PC versions (pre-2002), this card doesn't. I have an older HP Jornada 548, and thought I'd get a deal, since the additonal memory is basically ""free"". Would not install with the supplied drivers, not the driver downloaded from the SanDisk website. Also, wouldn't work with the drivers from the card w/o the memory. Had to return to Amazon.com, and order the LinkSys card..."
1,Sharp Zaurus-SL-5600,"Stay away from the SanDisik Connect Plus Wi-Fi adapter. This product was supposed to work flawlessly with the Sharp Zaurus SL-5600, just plug it in they said. Well let me tell you that just isn't the case. Neither the Wi-Fi nor the 128MB of memory show up in the Zaurus System. After performing a cardctl ident it will come up as SanDisk Connect Plus. But, nothing more will work. --Lets hope Sharp or SanDisk will fix the problem (because neither will refund me my money.)"
1,Garbage. Stay Away!,The WiFi component of this cards works but the memory is only sporadically accessable. Neither my Axim or my desktop USB reader can use it reliably. Sometimes the memory is available and at other times I get a message that the card isn't formatted. I have used plenty of CF memory cards before and I have never seen a problem like this. Don't waste your money until Sandisk gets around to fixing this problem.
4,Great tool but needs better documentation,"With my iPaq 3835 and Compact Flash sleeve I was able to setup the SanDisk card in about 30 minutes. It would have taken much less time if there had been ANY help in the documentation or online, but still, just by hacking around I was able to get up and running on my home wireless network in little time. One note: I use an Airport (by Apple) for my wireless point and the SanDisk picked it up immediately out of the box (even before I got the settings right). I definitely recommend this product - it is sturdy, the storage part of the card works great (nice bonus) and it does NOT stick far out the iPaq at all - just be sure you have some knowledge of wireless networking or a friend that can help you."
1,busted,"did not work, did not work, did not work, did not work, did not work, did I say it did not work"
1,Does not work with Jornada 928,"I have tried using this card with my Jornada 928 (Pocket PC 2002) but the Wifi has never worked. I can access the memory portion without any problem. Tried installing the driver from the mini CD, sandisk website and even tried using the Socket drivers but nothing worked. Sandisk support team is useless and they do not have a clue. Asking me to return the card or upgrade my PDA. What a waste of money. Dont want to give this even a single star but cant submit my review without this."
3,Average Product,"I purchased and use with HP iPaq h2215. Technical support or guidance in severly lacking, but once I had a computer-savvy person help get it operational, the wi-fi works well. It easily connects to my home network, and connected in a matter of seconds to wi fi network in local coffee shop. I have not had the chance to try out the memory capabilities."
5,Not a three plug extension as pictured,"The extension cord is a One plug out configuration, (NOT A 3 PLUG OUT AS PICTURED BY Amazon).This does not bother me; as a matter of fact, I was looking for the one plug extension all along.This one has the little led in the receptacle (plug out) for those dark areas like the inside of a room you are working on, or at night.The Century part number given is for the one plug out extension, so it looks like an Amazon goof.I got this beast of an extension (10 gauge wire which is larger then the wire in your wall)to run one of my portable compressors without bogging things down.Tried it out, and no lag on start up.I give this extension (even though the price is high) 5 stars and discounted the Amazon screw up."
2,Not up to Par,I have most of Glenn's recordings and this is my least favorite. I did not like the change of tempo for songs that are in all our heads.The choice of songs did not do justice to his voice.
3,Men's Adidas GORE-TEX Hikers Chocolate,These seem to be good boots. I haven't got them broke in all the way yet but so far they have been good. Maybe a little tight around the ankle but I think that will go away as I wear them more. They have excellent padding and support. I buy a lot of adidas and usually have no problem with the fit of my size but probably could have used a half size smaller in this case.
3,For die-fard AC/DC fans,"I bought this as a present for a friend who is a major AC/DC fan. This is the band Brian Johnson was in before joining AC/DC. It has a few cool tracks, but nothing to get too excited about."
2,Not quite what it could have been...,"Made in UK in 1997, Serial# PLATCD-240, Playing Time 49:28Well, here's yet another compilation released in the hopes of cashing in on the fact that AC/DC's Brian Johnson was once the singer for this UK band.GEORDIE released 4 albums and numerous singles, which stand in their own right as good 70's rock. This compilation offers some of those tracks, along with remixed and/or tampered versions.Not bad, but not quite as good as what it could have been. The remixing, as was done on some other previous compilations, makes this collection a tainted effort."
1,Very difficult to follow the information in book,"This book was very difficult to follow.The author jumps around throughout book.Usally the author calls Tories ""Loyalists"" and Minutemen ""Provincials"" But I found places in the book where the terminology is inconsistant. Around page 100 he calls the Loyalist Militia ""Provincials"" VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND!!!"
4,minute men interesting history,"I read a great deal of historical books, but the Minute Men was a fresh read. I learned a bunch and enjoyed doing it. It is of special interest to those of you, who like strategy and analysis of battle. It has a few more details than most will like that slows the read down, but they add to the depth of the read. Best of all, it offers an insight to the minute men and the American Revolution that I will treasure. This was a great Kindle book."
1,Too basic,"For me it was big disappointment, I could hardly get anything from this DVD. The moves were too basic, dance routines were not interesting either. Also, I would say that it shows more a classical way of doing striptease, while being a young woman I prefer something more modern & energeting (in this sense I really liked Exotic dance series). I still think this DVD can be useful for women with no or limited dance experience, or for those who do not feel confident about their bodies - self-acceptance is quite a part of this video."
1,ho hum...,"I was very disappointed. It was not what I expected, nor what I had hoped for.I felt it was not very positive and that I was being ""talked down to"".I'm sorry I bought it."
1,This thing is a piece of junk,"I bought this product today at Wal-Mart. I should have had a clue when there were a *lot* of them on a clearance shelf at half off. I got the heater home and out of the box. It worked at first but then quit working the minute I turned it off and then back on again. (I moved it from one outlet to another in the same room). From the other reviews I've read about it, this is a common occurrence. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews until AFTER I went all the way back to the store to exchange it for the same thing. Now, I have the second one and it quit working after I turned it off for a little while. It actually works quite well when it starts up, which is why I turned it off after a while. But try turning it back on -- forget it.This product wasted more time and gas money than it was worth, in my opinion."
1,Mine didn't work,"I bought one of these from Walmart. I have it turned on. No heat coming out. Either it is defective, or (?). I guess it is not working. I will have to take it back. I expected more from Honeywell for the money I paid."
1,Thermostat problem,Same experience as the other reviews. The heat is great when it is on but after the first 2 minutes it shuts off for about 1 minute and back on for about 15 seconds. It keeps repeating this pattern. Very disappointing for a Honeywell product. Kaz Incorporated bought this division of Honeywell in 2002. Appears to have impacted Honeywell quality. I wanted to give no stars but the review rating will not permit this.
1,disappointing,"I've loved the Kingston Trio since I first heard MTA when I was in grade school. I had several of their vinyl albums all of which were recorded in the studio. I'm not a fan of live onstage recordings because of the usually poor recording quality. This album is no exception.Most songs are performed with remarks I'm sure some people find witty but changing words to songs such as MTA and The Merry Minuet was very disappointing for me. Maybe if I had seen them on stage, I might have found this album more enjoyable. But the mangling of most of the songs was a great disappointment for me.In short, I'm sorry I spent my money on this one."
1,OMG,"The noodles I received was either expired or just crappy noodles. The taste and smell while cooking is bad. I know how they are suppose to smell and taste, and whatever you sent was not it."
5,Great Acoustic Recording,"This is an execllent acoustic music album with lovely vocal harmony. The Brothers Four revisted folk hits from '60, the recording sound fresh, and acoustic guitar arrangement is fantastic!!"
3,Disappointed,I guess I was expecting too much from the disc. The songs listed all looked so great but I was disappointed in the recording. It seemed rather shallow.
1,What A Disappointment,This is one of the worst CD's put out with Tom Jones' name on it and I am so disappointed. The sound quality is terrible - some songs are louder than others. It is a compilation of songs that have been taken from his various live performances - not a new CD. Save your money!!!
5,A fantasic book for kids.,"A modern day Grinch Who Stole Christmas story, very well written. My daughter loved it!"
4,i was very disappointed,"It is a great book, you learn sentence buliding and it tests if you learned the chapter, but i like it a lot it's one more aid a signer sould have, but the book wasen't what i thought...it's a great aid. another good thing about this book is that you learn alot of signs and you get to test yourself and the end of the chapter it's a good book, but the American Sign Language Concise Dictonary is much better."
2,Not what I thought it would be!,"This book is good for learning about the basic signs, but for me it was too easy for me to 'sneak a peak' when I would take a test at the end of the chapter. It told the basics of ASL, but not the indepth things that I was looking for. There are several books that are on the market these days, but this book is not too highly recommended by me. I thought it was alright for someone who wanted to 'touch up' on the ASL subject so that they don't get too rusty. But if your looking for something to teach you how to sign from the very beginning, then you need not get this book."
4,Signing Made Easy,"Great book, clearly displayed, signs are easy to understand and are very helpful in learning the language."
4,Great for learning,"This book is great for people that are just starting out. Its easy to follow along and the illustrations are clear. Sentence structure is a little harder using this book, however; to get a person started, this is a great book to use."
3,Not what I expected.,I was looking for the Signing Made Simple dictionary but this was all I found. Sadly it's not what I was looking for.
5,great book,"Great combination of introduction to signing with drill and practice. I am a teacher, and I highly recommend this book."
4,"Great book, lousy shipment that came",The book I used when I was in college and it really has helped me learn Sign Language. There are some signs that need to be more current due to the book being older. They really have just put a new cover on the book but it is the same from when I used it in college. The shipment I received was very bad!! The books came with no extra paper of any kind of material to keep the books from being bent or have pages from being wrinkled. Over half of my order showed up this way and I was not very pleased.
5,Signing Made Easy,Really good book! Easy to understand. It has a workbook included inside to help reinforce what you are learning. The best book I have found so far to learn sign language.
3,Do you believe in ghosts?,"Based on a true story about Eastern's Flight 401 that crashed in the Everglades in 1972. The book covers not only technical aspects of an airplane disaster, but also covers the human side. Sightings of the pilot, Captain Bob Loft, and the flight engineer, Don Repo, on planes with recycled parts of the doomed, 401 flight are reported by respected airline crew members as well as passengers. Eastern, of course, denied all. But the author was able to speak with many individuals in the airline industry and came to believe what he was hearing. Whether you believe in the after-life or not, this book raised many questions that there's not always an answer too."
4,I was supposed to be on that flight`,Very good book. I read it because I was supposed to be on this flight but for some unexplainable reason my mother (I was 3) decided to leave a day earlier.
4,Ghost of Flight 401,"Book quite used, but it was good to find a copy of this out-of-print book. It arrived very quickly. Very interesting book."
4,The Ghost of FLight 401,"This real-life supernatural incidint book is about an Eastern Airlines L-1011 crash in the Everglades in the early 70's. All cockpit crew was killed. Leter, two pilots from the crash start showing up on the plane. They often give info on a problem that may occur on the plane, and tells one of the flight crew. Information was gathered about many incidents happening on the Eastern planes. Eventually, enough informatin was gathered to ground the L-1011 Jumbo Jet"
4,"A spooky story--but that's all, just a story","I just finished watching a tv program called The Others where the episode was based on this incident--it reminded me of reading this book years ago. I have to admit, the book was a real page turner, and I got the willies on a number of occasions. So entertaining it certainly was--but that's about it. I have no doubt that the paranormal activities described in the book are not valid, and are either fabrications or figmants of the imagination."
5,Could Not Put Down,"This is one of my favorite books. I have read it 4 or 5 times and still enjoy it. It made me a believer in ghosts, as even the author was a skeptic before his experience on flight 401 that crashed into the Florida Everglades! This is a book I will read over and over again. (another being ""Adrift""; the story of Steve Callahan lost at sea for seventy-some days)"
2,"One more comment on ""Going Home""","After I submitted my review, I noticed that the description informed us that the book actually was one of Ms. Steel's first books. I guess I could cut it a little bit of slack then. I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even for a quick read"
3,O.K. Beginning for Danielle Steel,"THe book was o.k. It took awhile for it to take off. The writing at the beginning was a confusing hodgepodge. The characters were very difficult to identify with because most of them were so unlikeable, including the heroine. The Steel formula in this, her first novel, is already present here....her filthy language....her shortening of names ""GIL"" for ""GILLIAN"" and ""SAM"" for ""SAMANTHA"".....and the beginning of her sentence fragments and use of prepositional phrases. It won't be among my favorite of her works and the ending was morbid and depressing and, like all her books, too pat. Its o.k. but don't expect great literature from Danielle Steel. I never buy her books when they first come out. I always wait until they're at least two years old so I can buy them for a penny or at a used book store."
3,Not Bad For A First Novel,"The book captures the essence of California life in the early 1970's. Gillian is a divorced woman, a single parent who smokes marijuana and sleeps with a guy she's just met, without any kind of emotional angst or second thoughts. In most of her later novels, Danielle Steel's characters were sheltered and naive, and none were ever as wild or as badly behaved as Gillian, who sleeps around and uses extremely bad judgement as a parent.The writing is rough around the edges, and I believe this is Steel's only book that was written in the first person. It's not the best writing, but it definitely showed some promising talent and gave a hint of the writer that she would eventually become. If Danielle Steel had stayed on this track, with the offbeat flawed anti-heroine, I believe today she would be an entirely different kind of author, offbeat and quirky, more literary than commercial. She would still be well-loved by her readers, but her books wouldn't be NYT bestsellers."
3,No wander this was the first book by D.S.,"I actually was disappointed when I read this book, maybe it's cause I expected more. I've read many of her books and think they'll all great till Going Home came to my hands. It's much like other Steel's books but in this one nothing much happened, there was no this ""excitement"" when I read it."
5,"this book was inspiring, enlightening, and highly emotional.","This was the first book i read by Danielle Steel, and I enjoyed it from the first page to the last. I have read many other books by her, but this one was my favorite. I think that it is an easy read that goes by very quickly, yet it sends the reader a very deep message, that life is too short, and you should appreciate those who you love. After reading this novel, I was indeed sad, but happy that the author instilled in me a need to call all my loved ones and tell them what they mean to me. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who wants to experience a number of emotions all wrapped up together."
4,Going Home by Danielle Steel,Ordered this book for my mother who was very pleased with it. It arrived quickly and in great condition. Thank you.
2,Mediocre at best.,"I've read many Danielle Steel books, and thought that this book would be just as good as some that came after it. While I wish I could say this was a great first novel, it wasn't. The story is so boring that after a while you can't even pay attention to what goes on. You don't feel that you know the characters (protagonist especially) as well as you know the characters in the other books. Also, the slangs and dialogue are so outdated that it's distracting. Read other Danielle Steel books, but not this one."
4,Great Activities for homeschool kids,I homeschool my children and am always looking for great math materials to expose my children to. Piece of Pi offers many interesting and challenging activities for kids to explore. My kids love the activities and I love the teacher's easy to follow lesson guide. This book is a must to complement any math curriculum.
