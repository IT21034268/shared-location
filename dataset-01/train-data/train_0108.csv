4,In a book where not a lot happened...,"...I found myself engrossed. The Great Gatsby was a mystery to behold - a strong feeling of knowing better, but an unwillingness to admit so much. Like Nick, I was taken in by his charms and stories and did want to believe the best of him.After letting the book soak in I am convinced Gatsby was not the main character though, but that Nick was. It was as though what Nick told of other people was in a way a direct portrait of the narrator.I have a very warm feeling, finishing this book and will probably seek out more of the author's work."
2,Ok. Nothing special,"I picked up the Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald since it was one multiple ""all time best read"" lists, and this thin book was ok. Nothing out of the world to justify its presence on top 100 books of all time; apparently, there is a deeper secondary meaning in the story -- one that I could see, but could not appreciate as much."
2,Decent Book... Annoying style problems,"JUST MY OPINION.....While I do find the content of the book enjoyable,it has been somewhat agitating to read because too many times in the book,a sentence lacks commas thus making it difficult to quickly and clearly understandwhat the sentence is trying to express.For Example: About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed.While this one is pretty easy to understand, would it kill to put a comma between ""o'clock"" and ""the""?So... ""About three o'clock, the quality of Wilson's blah blah blah...""This is one of the hundreds of the problem in the book.Maybe it's just me, but this book could be a lot better with some copy-editing. Seriously."
2,What gives???,"This is a must read in most high schools, why can I buy the paperback for half of what a Kindle download costs? Thinking Kindle sounded good, but was a waste of money."
4,Beautiful but sadly unfulfilling.,"Perhaps one of the best works of the early 20th century, it is the epitome of all that was the Jazz Age. Fabulous wealth, extravagance, and romance. Still, the characters, especially Nick, seemed a bit 2-dimensional at times, and I personally wished that I could know more about them. Still, the book is a work of art and displays a powerful message, that there is no American Dream. None of the characters ever succeed to attain what they desire, due to personal failings or external forces. An essential read, but a hundred extra pages would have made it a near-perfect book."
4,Good Book,Very good book well written. One I will reread. Not for children. I read this in middle school and didn't understand all the adult complex lives.
3,It's okay,"Book has some interesting parts, but I still dont get why this book is a classic. I just wanted to read it because the movie is coming out soon."
4,great read,Its good so far... I've not finished the book yet so I've not got much to say except that I've always wanted to read the great gatsby..
3,Kind of boring,"Takes a long time to get to the heart of the plot. Flowery language, moderately interesting story line. Skip the book, get the movie."
3,The mediocre Gatsby,"A little bloated; overrated classic. Characters boring,but reflect the self-absorbsion of the '20s.Worth the effort, if only to grow one's perception of the pre-depression U. S."
2,The Great Gatsby Book,Very Hard To Follow. Had To read it Twice to Understand who was who. Did Not Enjoy It At All
3,Not the classic I was expecting,"It was an easy enough read but I felt a bit too distance from the characters and there was nothing really to empathize with.Everyone is shallow and rich in the 1920's. That's about it. The love story is kinda wishy washy and the ending is a downer.At least I can say I read it.*****This is a review of the kindle version of the book. $11.99 I paid for this book. This old book that was written in the 1950's. Why would publisher's raise the price on this? Also, there is no audible speech for this book. $11.99 and I can't plug it in and listen to the story while I am driving?The publishers should rethink their price for this book and enable the audio."
4,Thre Great Gatsby returns!!,"I loved the book but didn't reallize the print would be so small and light in this edition(paperback). I had not read the story before and thought it was much different from the older films. It will be interesting to read it again just before the new film is out. For older eyes, I would recommend another printing."
4,The Great Gatsby,"Splendidly drafted, the words carefully chosen to portray one of the most defining times of American history. Descriptive and a piece of english literature that will teach you the power of a good story with an excellent narrative"
5,An incredible novel and a lesson in characterization.,"The Great Gatsby is certainly a period piece that pays tribute to the excess of the 1920s. But more importantly, Fitzgerald's writing style is an excellent model for fiction writers looking for examples on charcter development. The author's descriptions are vivid, enticing, brutally honest, and, as far as I'm concerned, flawless. A beautifully tragic book and a must-read for any serious scholar of American literature."
5,classic masterpiece,"Need I say more? It seems inane to review The Great Gatsby because of its proverbial timelessness and consistent crowd of faithful readers, especially at my age and lack of literary experience, but it also seems blasphemous not to pay homage to Fitzgerald by indulging in his brillant novel. He intertwines the moral value of the rich vs. the poor in the early 1920's, and the general thematic virtues of life in an exceptional storyline. Fitzgerald tactfully constructs the plot throughout the majority of the novel, resulting in a crescendo of clashing characters and settings, but then slowly extinguishes the tension with a calming resolution. Several literary philosophies/movements are threaded throughout and it is an extraordinary read. I suggest it to anyone who likes classic literature or just books in general."
5,"Some say it's over-rated, I say it's genius!","I'm not an avid reader, but I absolutely adored Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'. The symbolism, time period, tragedy, question of mental conciousness, etc. kept me thinking about it for hours. I thought this book was extremely well written and perfect for any literature class."
4,It came on time,Thanks for the book.It's nice to get the book that is so cheap.And the cover of the book is the same as this one.
5,Mind blowing.,"I read this book during my sophomore year in High school, and just like any high school student I thought it was boring just from looking at it. However my teacher give stressed the idea of reading this book during the marking period. So I did after the first chapter I was mind blown. Fitzgerald did an phenomenal job building the characters of Daisy and Gatsby. The tragic death of Gatsby at the end was epic. By epic I mean I didn't expect it.Truly after this book I was hooked on and recommend it to any. I do agree with my High school teacher, this book should be mandatory. That academic year we read several other books such as Of mice and men, A race car named desired, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Cesar."
4,Literary Gem,"This is a must read for someone of all ages. I put it on ""the top 100 books that you must read before you die list!"""
4,good read,"F. Scott Fitzgerald is an excellent writer; I got caught up in the words he used, his phrasing. The story was good enough to keep me interested."
3,The Great Gatsby,"The book is fine..however all the underlining and highlighting makes it kind of untidy..understandable as a student used it. Also, after purchasing the book..I saw it for less than $8 in Borders in paperback, also. I had to pay $7.40? plus $7 something for postage. Postage is a killer ! LHK"
4,Timeless,"I didn't fully appreciate this in high school when it was required reading. Now that I am older I decided to read it again. This time I was able to absorb the book from an adult perspective. The story could be set in modern times, the language would be slightly less refined though. The characters were well developed, and their motivations were clear. It was an insightful read with a tragic feel throughout.Must read!"
3,"Beautiful prose, slow story","The prose is beautiful, which I did enjoy. But I didn't enjoy the story, which felt slow, pointless, and sometimes unintelligible. Nor did I care what happened to the characters.Natasha HolmeAuthor ofLesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder"
2,Great gatsby review,Average very confusing atparts of the story.But I felt the colors in the short symbolized a lot. Ok book
2,I cannot get through this book,I have tried to read this book on numerous occasions and I CANNOT get through it! I'm not sure why that is. I know it's a classic of sorts - but it just doesn't hold my attention. Looking forward to the movie!
3,The Great Gatsby,"Reading Fitzgerald in 2013, I was surprised by the ethnic and racial bias shown in his reference to black men as ""bucks, rolling their eyes"" and the nose and beady eyes of ""the Jew"" This was probably acceptable to 1920 Protestants but is jarring to today's reader."
5,Review of The Great Gatsby,"This novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of my favorite novels that I have ever read. I had to read it in high school and i have probably read it 10 times since then. I love the contrast between the morality of all the characters where Nick is moral almost to a fault while Gatsby and Daisy are both almost too immoral to function. This timely story contains action, scandal, love, and betrayal and it captures the escence of great American literature."
3,Ok,"Would give three &1/2 if could. Like the book ok, really didn't like any one in the book. Would maybe be better if it was a little longer."
3,Why?,"I was not forced to read this in school. I choose to read it, and I am not entirely sold on the idea that this book is some kind of master work. Since I have to take some time to think about the book and characters, I suppose it is worthy of some praise but I do not know exactly what to say about the book. Questions left unanswered. No answers can be found."
2,Where's the greatness in this novel?,This book has often been described as Fitzgerald's most beautiful piece of work and frankly I do not see it. I first read this book as a teenager for fun and remember disliking it immensely but later not remembering why. Now that I ave reread it I realize what that is. The type of people described and the way they act irk me. They are well off family surrounded by people that dothings to each other with no feelings. They just keep hurting each other without caring about the consequences.In the beginning of the book it is very boring and does not become interesting until Gatsby becomes involved in the story but the way people act towards one another.I do not really see the beauty in this story but I do see commentary on society I just do not agree with it.
4,food for thought,I find that it's always nice reread or even read a classic. I find that it centers me and allows me to then read other books that may or may NOT turn into classics themselves.Crisp descriptive writing that is full of symbolism. This novel gave me a lot to think about while I was reading it and afterward. Carraway is a complex character that everything in the novel is viewed through.
4,Smoke and Mirrors,"I find it interesting that so many of my Goodreads friends have this marked as 'read' but very few left reviews. (Goodreads is an online reading club/website) I felt a little stunned when reading this book as well. It wasn't at all what I expected. For starters is only 180 pages.The Great Gatsby - To me the title is sarcastic, condescending, and empathetic. It's a story about a man who ""...paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.""Gatsby told lies about his life to win Daisy. He then created a life to make those lies a reality. In the end nothing mattered. I was all a lie. Gatsby was a disturbed, obsessed man. The fact that no one attended his funeral showed that everything had been made up, superficial - he lived a life of smoke and mirrors.I'm glad I read this and may pick it up again some day. I'm afraid my reaction to it was based on preconceived notions."
4,"A great story, set in a great time","Fitzgerald shocks us with his portrayal of the roaring twenties. He lures us with his simple but misunderstood characters. And he finishes it off with his incredible ability to paint a picture of a decade so out of control. ""The Great Gatsby"" tells the story an incredibly wealthy man (Gatsby) who is somewhat of an oddball in the socially aggressive environment of New York in the twenties. Through the narrator, Fitzgerald gives us the insight into Gatsby's true character that others in the novel either don't pick up on, or ignore. The only thing I didn't like about this novel is Fitzgerald's ocasional use of the cheesy metaphor that other's find so eloquent. However, I'd have to say that this was one of the more enjoyable books I read this past year."
5,This is truely GREAT!!!!,"I know it sounds cheesy, but this book is the best I have ever read! Extremely embracing and attention-getting, The Great Gatsby, which was barely beaten out by Ulysses on the top 100 novel list, should be #1 on everyone elses' list!!! A+"
2,"gatsby overrated,but Fitzgerald's stlye exhilarating","The Great Gatsby is one of the most overrated books I've ever had the displeasure to read.Don't get me wrong their is stuff to enjoy in the book like F.Scott's rich and simple style and syntax, but the book lacks in other areas. The main one being that the book accomplished it's purpose.That is to show the lifestyle's of the rich that lived in the 20's and Gatsby's obsession wiht Daisy.And it was obsession not love.The problem with the above achievements is that the lifestyles of these people including Gatsby are so incredibly dull it makes for very little interest in the overall story.Also Fitz's choice of having a narrator as opposed to Gatsby's view made for even more yawning.The narration distanced me from Gatsby's obsession toward bland assessments by an outside presence(Nick).If you want to read a good book about obssession read Lolita."
4,Better the second time,Reading for the second after High School and it is much more romantic and deeper than I remember it being! Also has a great sense of humor...
2,Time to re-think this classic,"I originally read this book in high school, but I purchased this e-book to refresh my memory for the new Gatsby movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio coming out in the near future. The only thing it refreshed about my memory is that it's an extremely boring book with syntax that is hard to follow."
3,Classic,"I wanted a reading for my cellphone version of kindle, and this was a great option for me to read on spare moments."
3,The Great Gatsby,"Reading this book for the first time in more than 50 years,I did not experience a ""visit to an old friend"" that I had expected. I tried to read it casually which did not work. I intend to immediately begin to reread this book with more care, and will review it again when I have paid better attention to it. This is a book I have long wanted to discuss with an old friend who really is into the American Classics, and she has even taken college classes on F Scott Fitzgerald I don't know that I could get that deep, but I must have some understanding of it beyond characters I would think."
4,The Great Gatsby,"I thoroughly enjoyed The Great Gatsby and found it a quick and easy read. The themes of The Great Gatsby: wealth, beauty, greed and power mirrored the society of the Roaring Twenties perfectly. I did feel that one or two of the major revelations were dealt with too quickly and that more could have been done with them to add to the narrative. F. Scott Fitzgerald had a unique talent with words making his sentences beautiful and lyrical. I had a very clear picture in my mind of the world in which these characters were set. Also, through accurate, but succinct, descriptions I could imagine what they looked like, how they moved and spoke."
3,Great Gatsby Revisited,"Through F.Scott Fitzgerald's penchant for superfluous verbiage, he created a window into the greed and power-hungry wealth of the tumultous 1920s."
3,Not as Good as I remembered,"When I was in high school I had to read ""The Great Gatsby"" and remembered really enjoying it. Now, many years later, I didn't find it as engaging or interesting."
4,Dramatic Romance,"I found this book interesting to read even though it was an assigned reading for school. I like this book becuase there was romance, even just a little, and because I liked the characters, Nick and Gatsby. I like when Daisy and Jay Gatsby's past was describes and how he rubbed in Daisy's husband about their romantic past. In the end, I felt sorry for Jay Gatsby because he was killed for a crime he did not commit and he was blamed for this crime by Daisy's husband. I also felt sorry for Jay Gatsy because he tried so hard to win Daisy back and Daisy ends up staying with her husband, even though she knows that her husband put the blame of the murder on Jay"
4,Good Book to learn about the twenties!,"This book was interesting. The context was hard to understand at first, but we grew accustomed to it as we progressed. The beginning was slow but it soon picked up pace and was exciting. The story is almost like a soap opera. Fitzgerald uses large words to portray his thoughts and to give the book more detail. Overall great book."
4,I was expecting more,"I began The Great Gatsby with extremely high hopes of the great American novel. In truth, while well done, Gatsby is not as exceptional as many would have you believe. I think perhaps people have gotten to the point of lauding this book simply because it is the popular thing to do. I found it rather disjointed and mildly slow but the quote of the ""orgastic future"" and the ""mouth full of money"" are unforgettable and might be worth reading the book by themselves."
1,boring,"The only things that happened in this book happened in the last fifty pages. It's boring, and the only reason I read it is because it was an English assignment. The plot was dreary and I did not like it!"
1,Sucked,"The book was terrible, and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I would recommend buying a different book."
1,Some cheese with that whine?,"It seems that complaining is the national pastime, and this book is no exception. It would apear that Mr. Fitzgerald was somewhat unhappy, and decided to tell the world, along the way gving the rest of us something else to complain about. The critisisms of the American dream, and of rich people are true certainly, but hey, we already knew that. He seems to veiw love in a distant manner, as if it never works out for anybody. Self pity is such a wonderful thing, isn't it. So, if your feeling the least bit perky, just pick up a copy, and soon, if it doesn't put you to sleep, you'll find yourself in a dreary funk."
1,"terrible,terrible,terrible.....","I heard this book was a classic,a must read,so I read it.It was a bad book! I don't think anyone would have published it today.I am not so young as to not understand a ""great"" novel,so I must say ""this is one of the most boring and shallow books ever written"".I'll give him one thing-this boredom is beautifuly written.His language is beautiful and captures the mood of the time and place,but it doesn't make up for the complete lack of plot.I read,and read,and read and nothing happened.He had a good idea,Scott Fitzgerald but he didn't do much with it.I have noticed that readers don't like the bad reviews.I suspect they think such reviews are not serious,but please listen to me-IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS BOOK PLEASE DO! There are too many great and good books,there is too little time to read them,so don't waste your time!"
1,I didn't like it!,This book was just so bland. So vanilla. this book had nothing of any importance to me what so ever. I had no emotional ties to the characters and the whole thing just made me yawn!
2,Mediocre book,"This is professor of English George Armstrong's latest book, a look at hypocrisy. It is about a man named Bob, who wins a shaggy-dog contest only to discover that the President refuses to give him his prize money. Despairing, he flies to the Moon, where he meets two adorable aliens. Unfortunately, they end up killing everyone on Earth.Although many believe it to be a masterpiece, I thought this book was retarded."
1,"So, let me get this straight...","The Modern Library declares that this is the 2nd greatest novel of the 20th century?Are you serious? Above Lolita.and let's not forget the novels the list completely disregarded, that trample all over Fitzgerald's poorly dated morality tale:Gravity's RainbowV.The Crying of Lot 49White NoiseOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's NestJourney to the end of the NightNaked LunchBlood MeridianThe StrangerThe Old man and the SeaSeriously, Fitzgerald just was no good, and pales horribly in comparison to the true giant of 20th century American literature; Hemingway"
1,Awful.,"I read this book expecting much more. What I got was complete disappointment. There was absolutely nothing that appealed to me in this book. The story was boring, the characters were boring. This was truly one of the worst books I have ever read. I must be missing something because I seem to be one of the only ones on this earth who found the story to be awful. It was painful for me to get through this book."
1,Why all the hype?,"I think kids now-a-days, especially the ""hipsters"", just love literature involving fashion, emotion, sensuality, and suicide. This book is 'alright', its not fantastic.The main disappointment for me was that it was so predictable. I dont think this book deserves all the hype it's getting."
1,I'm GLAD F. Scott Fiztgerald is dead.,"That way he cannot write something this trite and boring again. ""Slow to start"" and ""ambling"" are such understatements when describing this thing I can barely call a book, yet alone a novel. The overflow of useless and uneeded information in this thing makes it several chapters longer than need be. In fact, if Fitzgerald had written this book properly (no extra junk I could care less about) it would have been EXACTLY two sentences long- ""I'm rich."" and ""Oh, boo hoo."" The plot line resembles an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 (namely ""Let's sit around and whine about being rich. Next we'll get drunk and call each other names, fight, and run each other over!"" SHUT UP ALREADY!) I can rarely can say this, but I HATE HATE HATE HATE this book! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK IF YOU CAN HELP IT!"
1,All hype,"If people read this book without knowing its history of success, what would they think of it? My guess is that it would be forgotten very quickly. If you are a high school student assigned to read this book, then unfortunately you have to suffer through it. If you are a teacher, please save the children and assign them a more interesting book. For those reading for pleasure, I recommend skipping this poorly written book. The characters are cartoons. They behave in a predictable manner and have no depth. Perhaps at the time it was written, people saw something in it that made it a worthwhile read but it has not passed the test of time. Don't waste your time."
1,"OK, it [was terrible]...","I absolutely hated this story. All the characters did was moan about their lives and do stupid things. Daisy was a complete waste of oxygen and the rest of the characters just cried. There was no action, no suspense, and no real plot. The story didn't pick up until the end which is, let me remind you, the end. This book should never have written!..."
5,The Great Novel,"by far, the best novel i have read in my 20 years of existence. i ask every girl i'm interested in if she's read it. a response of yes=we'll keep in touch and no=no love"
2,Didn't get it,"From reading reviews, it looks like I'm in the minority in being unimpressed with this book. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I found this modern classic to be just plain boring. The lives of upperclass Long Islanders in the 1920's was not interesting to me. I'm not sure how people consider this to be one of the best books written--what about Tolstoy, Dickens, Dostoevsky, etc.?"
5,Excellent Product and Service,The audio CD arrived in good shape and in a timely manner. It arrived before its expected delivery date. It was in good shape and had good sound. The product description on Amazon before I purchased it was accurate.
2,The most outdated boring book I've ever read,I consider myslelf well read. I bought this book knowing it was a classic (I love classics). I expected it to be more entertaining. For one thing it's very dated. I had trouble understanding what was going on most of the time. Another thing were it's racial undertones. The way mister Wolfheim was portrayed (a shady selfish businessmen) is an obvious anti-semantic stereotype. I couldn't get myself into the story because the characters were unlikable. I found myself checking the clock more than reading the story. The moral of the story (money can't buy happiness) isn't very well portrayed by Fitzgerald.
3,"Interesting Story, but did I really grasp it","Basically a love story that doesn't end on a happy note. I found it interesting how closly Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil imitates this book. They both go over the interesting characters that at some point merge to become a conflicting story of right and wrong. Wait, isn't that the main storyline for almost all books. I guess they seemed more alike since I read them back to back. Well, The Great Gatsby did seem to be on the verge of all of the modern convienences of the 1920's. I wonder if changing cultures brings about different thoughts on the definition of a classic book. This book was a so-so read and wasn't real captivating. Of course, I am one of those casual readers that doesn't always try to find meaning in a book like an academic reader. Enjoyment is what I am after."
5,"As the book says, it's great!","I was very reluctant in reading this book for my Honors English class. I had heard from many people that is was really boring. As it turns out, it's one of the best books I have ever read. It's well written, a good story, haunting symbolism, and a good read. The beginning is slow but as you learn more and more, everything falls into place. Recommended to anyone!"
1,I was not incredibly happy.,"The Great Gatsby took about a month to ship, barely sliding in under the deadline. When it arrived, there was a tear in the front top of the cover. I was not impressed by both the quality of the product and the speed of the service."
1,Nothing more than a poorly written soap,"The Great Gatsby contained nothing more than can be found in a TV soap opera. All of the characters where one sided and underdeveloped. The book makes a poor attempt at exploring human nature, which pales in comparison to great novels such as ""Catcher in the Rye"". It was one of the most boring and shallow books that I have ever read"
4,What a book!!,"This class novel was mandatory reading material sophomore and senior year of High School, but I continued to read this book through out college in my leisure time bc I love it so much.Such a good story"
1,Great American Novel - You Are Not!,"How this is an American classic, I will never know. The book is short and barely has any character development. You don't route for anyone nor really care about finding about anybody's back story - including Gatsby himself. The book does do an ok job of portraying that ""rich, post-World War I, 1920s era apathy generation"" but the problem with portraying apathy is that your readers are going to be apathetic. There is one part of the book that has some ""action"" in it but it's so shoe horned in for the sole purpose of rapping up the story that it's almost unbelievable. For those that poo-poo Twilight for ""stalker"" type mentality of Edward, you have the same behavior in Gatsby as well. I was very underwhelmed and feel sorry for the countless public school students who had to suffer through this book. The one positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as boring as ""Wuthering Heights"". Final Grade - F"
3,Shallow Hell!,"I read this book only because I had to for a literature class...this book may be good for some. I have to talked with friends and things that have said that they enjoy it, however I had a hard time getting into it!However a side from all of that! It gives a great depiction of the Rolling 20's and the shallowness of all people. I would recomend it to someone who loves to read about 10 books a week and wouldn't mind wasting their time to read one more. But as for me I didn't care for it!"
2,Tedious,"I am not certain why this book is considered a classic. There's not one likeable character to relate to. Selfish, self-involved, shallow people. The first half was rough going to read through. The second half, a little better. I found this very disappointing after hearing for so long that it was a must-read. So many other more special books to spend one's time with."
3,The Great (?) Gatsby,"I know many people consider this book to be a great literary classic. Honestly, I admit that Fitzgerald utilized figurative language and symbolism quite successfully. I truly enjoyed some of his satire and hidden meanings. You could analyze this book for years if you wanted to.The problem is that there are no truly noble characters to encourage a reader. All the characters seem to be involved in shady activities. The absence of a role model disturbs me and makes me wonder why the book is required reading at so many schools. (Some people have suggested that Nick is the sole moral person in the book; however, his willingness to aid in other's schemes seems to prove otherwise.)Here's my advice: To those who have to read it - read it, keep a good attitude, and take lots of notes. To those who want to read it- only read it if you don't mind reading about crazy lifestyles and love affairs.Happy reading!"
2,Wrong Cover,"The book that I ordered was The Great Gatsby. In the picture it shows the book with the traditional cover of this book, so that's what I was expecting. The cover of the book that I got was completely different. The cover is of a girl and with the title and the authors name. I have had this happen before, but this time I made sure that that was the only picture it was showing. But I still got the wrong cover."
5,INTERESTING,"Wonderfully enchanting. Definitely illustrates the parallels of love and especially money. TRAGICALLY beautiful , although, it was a bit slow"
3,More disappointing than I remember,"I had read this years ago, probably for HS required reading. It was on A&E a few weeks ago and I was only able to watch the first half (this is the Robert Redford version, not the remake). Well, instead of renting it I bought the book hoping to have it for my collection. I reread it and the whole story just seemed a lot less gripping than I remembered it. I'd resell the book but I got iced tea on some of the pages. Oh well."
2,Sorta' vague and boring,"I really thought this was going to be pretty interesting. But I was wrong. the book was kind of boring and it didn't seem complete. it was all about parties and stuff. It was also sort of vague. I felt as though I didn't know any of the characters. I just got a very brief history. I couldn't grasp them. This is the first time I have ever encountered this. This book was just plain boring. And yes, I did finish it, for those who read my 'Brothers Karamazov' review and hated it. But, I will not give up on Fitzgerald. I soon plan on reading 'This Side of Paradise,' or 'The Beautiful and the Damned.' Hopefully they will be more interesting than this one."
4,This is Tasty,"This book is a fine example of books that will be entertaining to those who like to read and those that are inapropriate for School purposes. this is a more pature book and i believe that it was writen with great passion and this is shown in Mr. Gatsby himself. with all the tragety in this book and the love story that is displayed, i would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a classic but not to anyone looking for just any old book and doesn't give it the respect it deserves. Blindspot is the best band in the WORLD."
2,haven't we seen this before?,"We read this book in hope of enjoying, it but what is there to like when you have read it before. It starts out interesting but the characters are boring and don't seem real. The ending is just plain bad."
2,the only good thing about it was its simplicity,"Even though I only had to read this for school, I can tell you one thing through my forced reading: the only good thing about this book was that I could read it fast. Fitzgerald puts across some good points, but the book left me without the feeling of having been there and only with images of what happened. He did not do a very good job of emphasizing the important points, and I'm afraid I missed some of them. I would only recommend this book if your intent is a long-term study of writers of the 20th century."
5,Just a thought,"Perhaps the reason that no film adaptation of Gatsby has been well-received is that no director could possibly compete with the pictures Fitzgerald paints in the reader's mind. If you haven't already, read this and lose yourself in this Jazz age Greek tragedy. And enjoy the movie in your mind."
4,The Great Gatsby,"The book, The Great Gatsby, is about a man, Jay Gatsby who embodies the very essence of the decade known as the Roaring Twenties. A wealthy man, obsessed with material possessions, Gatsby is convinced that through these he can obtain happiness, and more importantly, the heart of the woman he loves. He finds however, that his wealth and possessions can do nothing to give him personal fulfillment, and that they are of no worth in the end."
5,Timeless Classic,"I read this masterpiece when I was a kid. Reading it as an adult demonstrated to me why ""The Great Gatsby"" is revered as a classic. I have to concur that although a quick read it is most enjoyable. F. Scott pours his artistry into his work and it shows that he was indeed a great artist."
3,Slow start,This novel starts out slow. The middle painted a vivid picture. Endings are very important to me and greatly affect my overall opinion of a book. This was not my type of ending but is in fact a much more realistic outcome.
2,"For a classic, i wasn't impressed. I only kept reading, because I thought it would redeem itself. It didn't.","It was such a disappointment for a book which is considered a classic. Would not recommend it, or read it again."
4,Poignant,"The Great Gatsby truly is magical. It takes you on an amazing ride of emotions, from being piqued at the beginning to depressed at the end. Although the story isn't brilliant, the beauty of this book isn't in the story. It's the narrative that wins you over. It's how the author puts his spin on situations that is so awe-inspiring. Fitzgerald is a writer par excellence and this book is a classic."
4,Easy Read,"I saw the movie previews the other day and I wanted to read the book before watching it in theaters. I finished this book in 5 hours and couldn't put it down. It was interesting, but not exactly sure what unfolded at the end."
3,Read it before you see the movie!,"I think I read this in high school but didn't remember it at all. With the new movie coming out I felt it was appropriate to read it first since it is a classic. The story is a simple one we know well - a tragic love triangle (but more like a love octagon) but we see everything through the eyes of Nick Carraway, who is just a witness to it all like us. Just like we are fascinated by rich, famous people, Nick is fascinated by Jay Gatsby and we get brought into his world. Definitely liking forward to the movie and then re-reading it!"
5,A Sophmore's review,"I finished this book during biology and have nothing negative to say about it. It had great symbolism, plot, and all the necessary elements to be considered a classic example of modernism. I disagree with the person who said that teenagers cannot appreciate classics. It is true that some of us are immature, but that cannot be said for all. The Great Gatsby is one of the best books I have read this year, along with The Scarlet Letter. I would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the language."
5,A classic that will always carry meaning,"The talent of F. Scott Fitzgerald weaving intricate twists, deeply human emotions and reality into his characters makes this a classic book. It's a story that carries a great deal of meaning. It's a story anyone can learn from while soaking in the depth of genius with which this book was written.Truly a must read!"
5,the great gatsby,My daughter had to purchase this book for her literature class. I had never read this book and so I thought I would read it. This is one of the best books I have ever read.
3,It's okay,Another of the golden oldies.I found that this one was quite slow in places and also that the storyline to be pretty average.Worth a read on a rainy afternoon though if you have nothing else planned.
4,Friends in Need...,"What a great book, a classic that can be read at any time....Fitzgerald style in writing is amazing, a book that is so easy to read and comeplete in one day...Nick builds a great relationship with his neighbour the great Jay Gatsby and they become the best of friends. Gatsby has the best parties in town, and people show at his house with no invitation...Gatsby's love for superficial Daisy is to be admired, he is calm in his ways, but makes sure that things are under control...Nick discovers the hard way what people are made of, how opportunist they are, and how they are driven by money and fame, they make it a point to be next to what they call a ""friend"" in good times, and you don't find any when things start going south..."
4,Loaded with good lines,"This is an excellent novel, filled with fascinating characters and recognition of superficiality. Gatsby (born Gatz) is a man of mystery, almost like Kurtz of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Much like the Conrad book, a certain aura surrounds Gatsby--he is a man of mysterious abilities and unknown origins. I would recommend to anyone this story about a bootlegger whose prepetual party comes to a fatal end."
3,classic,"A very good story to say the least but it was a little hard to understand. I had to re-read paragraphs to get a grip on the story a little better but I assume the book reads like that because it was written so long ago using the ""language"" of that era. I read this along with my daughter as suggested by her English teacher. The book did spark conversation about the early 1900s and some of the ""symbolism"" in the story, which was enjoyable. It's a classic and worth reading but it's not what I call a page turner."
5,Perhaps the greatest American novel.,"It is very difficult for me to understand why the average rating given The Great Gatsby by reviewers isn't five stars. In my view this is one of the greatest novels ever written -- perhaps even THE great American novel. This book is so well written that it would be a pleasure to read even if it didn't have a plot. But it does have a plot -- one that is both well constructed and quintessentially American -- as well as characters so well-developed one feels that one knows them. If you haven't read the Great Gatsby yet, please do so -- and find out how good truly great writing can be."
4,The Great Gatsby,"I enjoyed reading ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was a book that really kept me interestd in it with its exciting plot. Chasing dreams and lost loves, love affairs, lavish houses, and big parties make the story exciting. The characters in this novel really draw you into the story. Some are mysterious, some are cruel, some are kind, but they're all interesting in their own way. Their obsession with wealth, chasing after dreams and goals, and wanting to repeat the past gets the characters into a big mess of problems. Not only is it a very good story, but it is also very well written. The book has deeper meanings to it and many symbolisms that make you really get into what you are reading. You would also enjoy this book if you like history because it demonstrates what life was like in the 1920's. The Great Gatsby was a really great book, and I would recomend for people to read it."
5,A good book by a dead white guy.,"This book is great. I saw the movie in my 20th Century American Literature class last year as well as reading it over the summer for my AP English class. The two are not even close to being the same. At first I didn't know what to think of the book, it was strange and confusing and then it was romantic. Over all it was a very emotional book for me. After reading the book I did a research project for the book. I discovered that this book is so similar to Fitzgerald's life. He reminded me of each one of the male characters in some sort of way. Tom had the affair just as he(Fitzgerald) did. Gatsby felt left out at all the infamous parties just as Fitzgerald did. This book is definetly worthy of reading! I suggest it to all!"
5,STILL a great work of literature.,"F. Scott Fitzgerald did with Great Gatsby in literature what Orson Welles did with Citizen Kane in film: he made something sweet and sublime and simple and complex and brilliant. Fitzgerald effectively describes with a few words what other authors would squander pages on, and his prose still manages to be smooth and flowing. And what's not to understand? The love, the murder, the partying? You can find the same things at your average weekend kegger. The difference is, in THe Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald shows the American people for what they were, and still are today- greedy excessive, and self-centered. Which is why Gatsby is still a great novel."
5,wonderful,"The way fitzgerald shows the carelessness of the weathy people of the ""great"" jazz age is wonderful. The way he used Nick Carraway as the narrater was marvelous. I like the way you start to like these characters and then Fitzgerald starts to show the horrible person that they are. I would recommend this book to anyone you will learn alot about the 20's and perhaps about yourself."
5,excellent! i'm glad i read it,"i read this book for english 10, and i gotta say, it immediately became one of my favorites. it's one of the only ""great american classics"" i've ever read and actually loved. the story was so relevant and the characters were so real, and the descriptions were amazing. i really understood the book (thanks in part to my teacher who loves it to death and was good enough to explain every little thing in detail) and it was very accurate. i could go on and on but i'mnot the best review writer, so i'll leave it at this: read this book, you will not regret it."
3,good....but not great,"it was a good novel...it drew me into its settings, and it had a good plot, with SOME excellent characters, but i couldn't really connect myself with Gatsby, who was arguably the central character. Daisy's character was a joy to read, and she made me laugh many times. It is an easy book to get into, and gets into the plot quite quickly, keeping a perfect pace and suspensefulness, which is an art in itself. great to read for the simple pleasure of reading, but i didn't draw anything out of it, and it didnt haunt me like great novels do. To me it read like a well written magazine article, a pleasure, but not entirely purposeful."
2,Beautiful prose yet shallow book,"I found it practically impossible to enjoy this book because it is about shallow, careless and carefree people. Because the characters are extremely dull and flippant about life, I found the book itself to be a dull read. It was like trying to swallow terrible tasting medicine. This book certainly does not attempt to tackle any of life's problems. I give this book two stars rather than one, however, because Fitzgerald deserves credit for the mystical, beautifully flowing,light, prose which he uses. I particularly enjoyed the beginning of the chapter of the garden party at Gatsby's mansion, as well as the end of the novel."
3,Interesting story but it's a disappointing book,"After reading this book, I wondered why Fitzgerald chose to tell the story from Nick's perspective. But I realized it was because he is the only character worth cheering for in this book. I hoped Fitzgerald would give more information about Mr. Wilson, and Gatsby, so their characters would be more developed. I was disappointed. It was a very chilling conclusion to the book, and written well, but I hoped the characters would be developed more and discussed in greater detail."
3,Bizarre and not terribly interesting,"One of the better ""classics"" that I have read, and I have read quite a few, but still not a very enthralling book."
3,WAY too over hyped,"yes, the great gatsby is an american classic. yes, the great gatsby touches upon the major themes of american literature. BUT IT IS WAY TOO OVER HYPED. when i read the book in school, i was expecting to be blown away, and when i finished it, i was very disappointed. sO, i do recommend the book. it IS a good book, but NOT great. if you REALLY want to read a good book, read gabriel garcia marquez' cien anos de soledad. :) have a nice day!"
2,"Ugh, Gatsby anything but Great","As a much praised literary work of art, I must say, this book leaves much to be desired. While it does depict a historically accurate and believable account of the 1920s, not one of the characters seems to be anything more that a superficial comsumer or partygoer. Through the entire novel, Nick Carraway, our straighfoward, if not boring, narrator is a shadow of a real man, showing no courage or brain for himself. In the end, just when he could stand up and change the entire point of view for the characters, he chooses to stay comfortable in his little corner of his unimpressionable life. Unless you are being forced to read this for a class, or are drawn to incredibly dull and lifeless books, I would advise you to skip this and do something like wash your hair or watch paint dry, instead."
3,Good in Parts,"This book was okay but confusing in that I can't for the life of me see how it deserves all the praise heaped on it. No way is it up to Steinbecks standard. It was told in the first person by a character called Nick Carraway who, it must be said, is a very boring character.The others in the book seem SO two dimensional. It was an okay book though, just like a thousand others on the shelves."
3,Not so great Gatsby,"Response to literature is a matter of taste and taste is often a matter of experience. Those who haven't read much (and widely) are less likely to be able to discriminate between what is significant and what is not. But even experience and an open mind do not guarantee a positive response to every classic. I always wanted to like The Great Gatsby because it was one of those books in the canon of accepted 'great' American books, but repeated attempts at the book still leave me cold. I don't find anyone in the novel to care for and if one doesn't care about the characters, one doesn't care what happens to them.'Gatsby', I think, is a minor book about very shallow people. Fitzgerald's language seems, to me, overblown and almost, at times, adolescent. I think it is significant as a document - a historical marker for a period in American history - but not as a great work of art, or of entertainment."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..........,"Oops, sorry about that ! I seem to have fallen asleep again. Wonderful book for insomnia this....zzzzzzzzz"
1,I personally didn't like it at all!,"I though it was a really bad book, and most of the other people that read it in school for L.A. with me also did not enjoy it. It could have left out many of the chapters in my opinion, most of them had no point. I read some of the other reviews, they said they couldn't put it down, but I dreaded the days we had to read from it for homework. I also didn't like his style of writing, the symolism was okay, but too deep for some people. I would not recomend this book to anyone."
1,An overrated author.,"Fitzgerald did not create a masterpiece with this horrifying wonder of modern literature. In the story his over use of meaningless description and verbosity indicates to the reader that he was trying too hard, and it would be unrealistic to believe that this is a natural voice. As an example of writing style, I would expect it from someone in grade 6, with a dictionary. The sentences are basic and blunt, and interspersed with horrendously redundant words that were probably put there to make the author look smart, since they were more than 5 letters long of course!. If the author was alive, I would suggest he re-write the story without the blatant attempt at Dickens verbosity and write it in an actual voice that is readable and consistent."
2,Good enough.,"I was forced to read this book for my high school English class. It was an easy read--the book's not long and the language is not too difficult. I'd like to say that the concept's are not too difficult either, but I just don't know what those concepts were supposed to have been. I tried to read into it, but I just didn't get very far. I take that to mean that there wasn't too terribly much there.There was an added difficulty in the fact that I didn't like any of the characters. If you can't stand any of the people in a story, then you don't really care about what happens to them, and you start to skip large sections of stories that involve them....Anyway, I'll say this: It was OK. If you can look beyond the miserable people and the almost non-existent message, then you'll like it just fine."
2,The Great Gatsby,I thought I would really like The Great Gatsby because you hear so much about it but it reminded me too much of a soap opera. In fact I couldnt believe how overly silly and dull the plot was. It was like a 1970s miniseries. Also Fitzgerald is a very bland writer. I dont know. Maybe I should try it again.
2,This book was confusing and a little boring.,"This book was very difficult to get into. After the first few chapters it is probably an okay book but I didn't get that far. That is all I have to say since I only read the first few pages of this not-so-interesting book. My advice to you is if you have a short attention span then don't read this book, but if you like to be bored then this is the book for you."
2,I *wanted* to like it...,"The Great Gatsby, frankly, was not that great. Maybe I'm not ready for it yet, I don't know (I had to read it for English class). Fitzgerald's writing was very vague. At times, a novel calls for vague writing, and it works. In this case, it did not. He just skimmed over the important parts and honed in on pointless details. The entire book had a very ghostly quality; I always felt like something was there, but it was mostly undetectable. Still, it has its good points - I liked the way Fitzgerald protrayed Gatsby's fair-weather friends, and the tragic ending that could be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy, when no one is left but the narrator :). I'm not entirely sure what to make of this book, I think I'll read it again in a few years. Until then, I shall be mystified by those who gave this book 5 stars, and rename the book ""The Okay Gatsby""."
5,Fitzgerald brings up the question of moral character.,"The Great Gatsby is a great novel not only by illustrating the ""Jazz Age"" with all its greatness but it also depicts the failure of searching for moral character in the pursuit for the ""American Dream"". Fitzgerald has made a masterpiece that will dwell in modern society."
2,Ben Helford: Jay Gatsby,"I really liked this book, but there was one thing that it lacked. This was sympathy for the Jewish People. Sure... Fitzgerald would be happy to talk about the Irish, but not the Jewish. This gets a thumbs down in my book. Ben Helford"
5,How does this book only get 4 out of 5 stars?,"This is the best American book of the 20th century, yet its average review on Amazon is only 4 out 5, and many mysteries get 4.5? What an injustice!"
5,The Great Gatsby,"I recently read the book ""The Great Gatsby"". The book is the all-american novel for everyone. The Great Gatsby should not sit on a book shelf. The book is the most esquisit book I have read to date. The book deals with all aspects of love and the trials of life. ""The Great Gatsby"" Is a text that a person can read a chapter and then leave it laying there for more than a day. Since the author is so descriptive, it made me feel like I was in the story. I felt like I was a part of thier lifes.I could refer back to the text and compare my life with thier life. This book is inspirational to all people including young new writers. The book has to be one of the best books out there. I reconmend this book to everybody."
4,Needs Further Explination,"This is my first encounter with THE GREAT GATSBY. I read the book because the movie preview intrigued me. And to be honest, someone told me falsities about the plot. But I was surprise and greatly entertained by this short fiction. I only wish we could have been given more insight to the characters and their existence. I feel like I need a follow-up of or character/plot analysis.I own the e-book version and because I did enjoy the story, I purchased a print version as well. I would recommend everyone read this book. There are indeed a lot of 'goings on' I give it four stars because, I feel like I was left wanting more."
4,Good book,I liked the book. And the use of symbolism with the American dream and the great depression made it all the more interesting.
4,Classic protagonist,Jay Gatsby's s ignorance when it comes to the rules governed by high society makes him the timeless model of all future characters of this genre.
3,a real snoozer,"This was the most difficult book to finish that I have ever picked up. I suppose that is because drama and romance are not the subjects that interest me the most. If you are a fan of the romance genre you may rate this one a bit higher than I.The writing style is good, however, the storyline is predictible and dry. What is lacking in this book is a bit of action or real suspense. If if weren't for the quality and craftsmanship of Mr. Fitzgerald I would have reviewed this book at a 1 star.Based upon the reviews clearly individuals give out way to many 5 stars. For me a 5 star review is a book that: 1)I will definitely buy 2)I will read as part of an annual pilgrimage and 3)I could recommend to you with clear conscience that I'm not wasting your time. For most individuals this book is going to be a waste of time."
1,"Ridiculous, and kind of insulting.","This review is not about the book itself, but about the Kindle Edition method of purchasing it. I love this book dearly, I really do, but seriously. Can anyone even BEGIN to explain to me why the Kindle edition is three dollars MORE EXPENSIVE than the paperback? With Kindle books, you don't even have to pay for the paper! To whoever it was who set these prices: I think it's disgusting that you would pull a dirty trick like that on your customers, knowing that a lot of people buy the Kindle edition first, without looking at the paperback. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.This book would have been an easy sale to me, Amazon, because I would really prefer to have it on my Kindle. But I will instead be buying the paperback from Barnes & Noble, even if it comes out to more than $12.99, out of sheer principle."
4,Great,Very good book. Had to read it for my AP Lit class and never felt like an assignment. Would read again.
5,The Great Gatsby,I chose this rating because this book really surprised Me. It was extremely interesting and full of detail. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read.
4,Breathtaking,This book was one of the most adorable books ever. It amazed me that Fitzgerald made so many references to transient yet important moments in life which we usually take for granted in life. It evoked feelings in me that made me think of the emotions behind a first kiss or the ones evoked when watching a couple bloom and fall apart. Simply Amazing.
3,An intricate but realistic fantasy!,"At first i did not see the big picture of what the book was trying to convey. But after the useless imagery, i understood that the goal to have success, love, and happiness is driven by those who have big dreams. Happiness is transitory in a world where there are carousing parties filled with drunkeness and infildelity with your loved ones."
3,Ok.... But could be improved,"The book starts off with good intentions, but as the plot continues it loses intrest. Later, the book starts to fallow a pattern and so you can predict what will happen next. The fact that the book ends with three deaths makes it all the more predictable. It cold be improved."
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK,"I was fourteen years old when I first read this book and I loved it.A few weeks ago when I was feeling down and depressed I read it again and for some odd reason I hated it. I suppose it was the way I was feeling but right afterwards i wrote a very negative review for this book which I would now like to take back. A few days ago i decided to read the book once again because I was wondering why I had been so bored and depressed by that second reading. I read it again and was soon discovering my original enjoyment of the story. I suppose it was just typical teenage moodiness. It is a great story, and I especially like the descriptive bits, like where it describes Daisy and the tennis player(I cant remember her name at this second) as floating in white dresses on the coach. Gatsbys parties and the drunken party at Toms mistress's house are wonderful. The characters are very true to life and I loved the mysteriousness of Gatsby. This is a very sad but good book and I fully recommend it."
5,wow,i read the great gatsby and i was impressed. i don't really know what to say about it. it was an excellent book. it is definately required reading
3,"Well written, unimaginative","While the book's story was somewhat predictable (as it uses an overplayed and tired theme), Fitzgerald's lyricism in description is astounding. If for no other reason, read this book to find out how well-constructed and beautiful a literary description can be."
4,Suprised,"Overall I really enjoyed the great Gatsby. Although it seemed a little dull in the first few chapters, The Great Gatsby has a great impact on a reader. The symbolism and the story contrast with each other perfectly. It is an exciting heartfelt story that I was hesitant to read at first but I actually ended up reading most of it in one day, which I think is very unusual for a student like me. The Characters in the novel seem almost to real and the story if followed carefully has an overwhelming amount of symbolism and meaning. This book really suprised me. Most books really don't appeal to me I am a very picky person when it comes to reading a good book and when I was finished The Great Gatsby I was very pleased with it overall!"
5,Great Classic,How can you go wrong with The Great Gatsby! I read this book in high school when I was only the country for 2 years. So I decided to reread it again. It's a perfect summer read. And I like much more than the first time reading it.
3,grrr,"The Great Gatsby is brilliantly written, really. Fitzgerald's imagery is romantic and brutally vivid, and his storyline is boorishly realistic. I liked the book. But from my point of veiw it was depressing. i think everyone is entiltled to their own opinion, and i think all of these 'adults' should quit bashing us teens."
3,"Much ado about nothing (well, almost)","After several years of hesitation, I finally read Fitzgerald's classic at the end of which I couldn't help but wonder what the fuss is all about. Suffice to say that the book is probably more famous for what it represents than the literary value of its contents. The plot is trivially simple and at times over-dramatised. The saving grace comes in the form of the spare and lucid writing, and the Roaring 20s' atmosphere that is essentially the central theme of the book."
3,The Great Gatsby,"I did not like this book at all. I know it is a classic,but not for me. All that happens is that they have parties gfet drunk and have another party"
3,"Meh, overrated","Overrated. None of the characters have any real depth. The descriptions often seem vague, as if the writer thinks he's being profound. The plot's fine, a bit soap-y. There's a good reason this book was out of print for 20 (or was it 30?) years."
3,Language of Another Era,"Reader's of The Great Gatsby will quickly realize that the book is somewhat difficult to understand. F Scott Fitzgerald's language is so proper and educated that most people will have to read the book multiple times in order to begin to understand it. The language, in my view, is poetic in form. It may be hard to interpret, but once you understand it, it is one of the greatest American novels every written. Make sure you have time to read the book several times before you decide to embark on the adventure.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"
4,Great Gatsby,"I have not started to read it as yet, as it is for a school project. But I am familiar with the story, as I read it many years ago, and I know that it's a great book."
5,Prompt service!,"This was another college book I purchased, 5 stars again! This book arrived in 2 days and the book was in great condition, brand new. The price was very reasonable. I'm always satisfied with my Amazon purchases!"
5,awesome condition,"The Great Gatsby was in ""very good"" condition just like the description said it would be. I was very happy with this product and I cannot wait to read my new book. Thanks so much joannesbooksgalore for your wonderful addition to my library!"
4,Whatcha see is whatcha get!,"It was exactly what I expected. I am certainly proud of my choice. There are some pencil markings in it. However, they serve to illuminate the story further than I would have ventured to go at alone. Thanks!"
1,Do not order this version of a great book,"This is the cheapest version of any book I've ever seen! I wondered if I had received the wrong book when I saw how THIN this paperback is. Well, here's how they did it: The print is so small as to be unreadable, in addition to the ink's being so light that it is grey instead of black. The pages are not even numbered! The paper is of lowest quality. Overall it's an embarrassment of poor quality. Mr. Fitzgerald would not approve and neither do I."
5,Great read,"My husband suggested I read it and I loved it. I would recommend Gatsby for all ages. It's full of life, love, and mystery."
4,Easy to Get Into Story,"This is a wonderful book that describes a love story set in the 1920's. Gatsby was a man that seemed to always get what he wanted, and he wanted a married woman. Sad ending, but most love stories have to end sadly."
3,Classic,I really enjoy this book and find it to be a classic. It had been about 10 or so years since the last time I read it.
3,The Great Gatsby,"I don't know. I'd heard all about this ""fantastic"" epic of a novel, but actually found it dragging and disappointing. Now there's a film out about it, which I will deliberately choose to NOT go see. Charles Reap ""ReadAReap.Com."" Author on Aazon and Kindle."
5,BETTER as AN ADULT,"I don't know why I decided to read this, I don't even know if I read it in HS, but as an adult the nuances of the book are much more relevant. This is a timeless read."
2,Obvious Consumerism and It's 'Benefits'.,"This is a story of how loud 'leaders' who lack honesty and respect can mislead others who tend to be followers. It is a story of self-centeredness, disrespect, dishonesty and obvious consumerism. It was so discouraging that I finally quit the book, which I very seldom do. There is just no entertainment in self-indulged depravity."
3,cool old look but worried it will fall apart,it's old! I'm so worried it will fall apart one day and this is a book I plan on keeping for years! Wish it was in better condition. The age makes the book have a cool aesthetic but I'm looking for utility! :c
5,Superb,"It is, arguably, the greatest American novel. Read the last 2 pages and you are reading some of the most beautiful prose in the English language. Fitzgerald once said that he could never forgive the rich for being rich. This novel makes sense of that statement. And the last line feels like a punch in the stomach."
4,Fourth time read!,"This is the fourth time I have the honor of reading this book, in preparation of the upcoming movie.I love it and it seems to get better everytime.If you haven't read it - read it before the movie and if you have read it - this should be at the top of the re-read pile!"
1,The 1920's Are Over,"They say a book can never get old, and with age they become classics. The Great Gatsby is a prime counterexample of this.In my opinion, a book that is entertaining and exciting needs to stretch the mind. It needs to use great imagination. Imagination makes mystery and murder novels scary and thrilling. Imagination makes a sci-fi interesting. What is there to imagine about The Great Gatsby? There are murders, but not very unique ones. If I wanted to read a good murder mystery, I would go to Thomas Harris. As for the love story The Great Gastby is placed around, I see this as the only conflict in the book. Every event in the entire book was based on this unrealistic relationship between Daisy, Tom, and Jay.To conclude, I would expect this story in a 1920's newspaper rather than being a mass produced as a ""classic"" novel. The only use I have for this book is a sleeping-pill substitute."
1,what's the big deal?,"when i looked at reviews for this many people said this was a classic and a must read. please! this book was one of the worst things i have ever read. i personally had no desire to read about spoiled rich people who had problems. omg i really had no sympathy for any of the characters, especially Gatsby. honestly, he had it coming. i'm sure a lot of older people will enjoy this book but if your under 21 i'd stay far far away"
1,El Terrible,This book was God awful. I felt so disappointed when i read that gatsby was murdered. I felt as if the world collapsed on me as i read this catastrophic event. Gatsby is the miz an and daisy is a sliz to the iz ut. Scott Fitzgerald i wish u were alive so i could kill u. Love DGS!!!
1,not so great...,"Of course Gatsby is world-renowned and loved all over, but I just don't see how! I just wish that someone would have warned me before I read it. I read constantly and have been for 25 years or so and this was one of the least engaging books I've ever read. I feel as if the people that read it and laud it are just being followers for the most part. I'm being very serious when I say that I honestly cannot believe this book ever got famous. To each his own though I suppose....Happy reading everyone."
1,don't bother,"terrible, terrible, terrible! This incredibly boring book, although considered an american classic, is dismal. Don't bother with it, and read Douglas Adams instead."
3,"okay story, very long","The book was okay, it had a good plot, but could have been shorter. It was a little bit too political for my taste. It seemed to take a long time forthings to happen. The book is very descriptive when it comes to setting. Every little detail is described, along with thoughts and feelings. I had a hard time keeping my attention focused. There was a lot of confusion as to what was going on with who, and where. Many parts of the book I had to go back and re-read to get a full understanding of it. The plot was decent, aimed more towards romantics than others. At times it seemed like one big soap. Overall if you have to read it, it is readable, if you are interested in life and the times, you'll like it, if your more into action and adventure, you won't find it here, however it's not a total waiste of time to read. The Great Gatsby is a very drematic book, and it holds a lot of truth. Many of the things discussed in it reflect on even todays society."
1,Dumb Book!,"This book was given to me as an asignment. I had to read it and it was boring! I have never read a book that almost had no point to it in my whole life. I don't see a point in reading about people with no lives. The book should have been about the narrator. He was the one who had a life. Nick, the narrator should have been the star of the book."
1,The Great Gatsby Greatly Annoys Me,"I do not understand why this is a classic, for the following reasons:1. The descriptions of things like an entrance hall that went on for at least two pages.2. The vacuous characters, who lived in an artificial world unconcerned with anything but the great American pastime, avarice (which I might add, is a Catholic Deadly Sin for good reason);3. Daisy's irresponsibility inI. wanting stupidity in her daughter(boy do I feel sorry for the girl)- there were some women then who wanted moreII. letting Gatsby (her LOVER for God's sake) take the blame for running Myrtle over when she drove his car, getting Gatsby killed.4. Its overall PRETENTIOUSNESS!I had to read it for English, and by God, every sentence bored me to sleep.Please do not waste your time with these undead characters (without brains, they must CONSUME AND CONSUME AND CONSUME)."
3,Great Gatsby Review,"I thought this book was overall a pretty good book to read, for teenagers my age. They had alot of interesting things going on in the book, such as, Tom and Daisy's affairs, Gatsby falling in love with Daisy,and Myrtle being hit by a car, and random parties at the gatsby's mansion.. As teenagers you can relate to wanting to be rich and famous, like Gatsby dreamed, and also going to parties and falling in love."
3,"The ""3 star"" Gatsby","The book ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a piece of literature that shows that man has a chance at success and fortune and/or a chance at a solid relationship. Money and success in a goal for the ambitious, and F. Scott Fitzgerald hit this hard. However, the 3 out of 5, is because this book is lacking in excitement and adventure. This book is for the people that enjoy detailed parties and a man looking for a future. But, I had to give credit where credit is due. Fitzgerald is a brilliant writer, although he writes with a style that; leaves you to organize the event.These events will determine if you will trust the character Jay Gatsby in the end. I hope you will enjoy this book more then I did."
2,Floundering in New York,"This is just my simple opinion, but when I read The Great Gatsby, I found it to be 1) extremely difficult to follow, and 2) drastically overbearing. People describe F. Scott's Fitzgerald's writing as poetic, and indeed it is at some points in the book. However I believe that as a result of this, Gatsby is much more difficult to read and comprehend. I would have preferred a more traditional writing style instead of a over-embellished, over-done, and, most importantly, an overly-complex style of writing."
5,The GREAT Gatsby,"The greatness of The Great Gatsby is layered; there are elements of the mechanics by Fitzgerald that are unmatched and then there are the characters and the story and the setting. It is a masterpiece; I first read the book years ago and only in time after re-visiting it and re-reading do you get what Fitzgerald was going after. It is relatively short for a novel yet it is an epic in ideas and idealism centering around the American Dream. The characters described; Daisy, Nick, tom, Gatsby; they are richly portrayed in their own ways. Fitzgerald is a master in setting the scene; each desire, emotion and quest bouncing off of one another in the place where all dreams face off: West Egg. This is a must read."
4,Nick Carraway,"Most reviews of this book talk of nothing but the love affair of Daisy and Jay Gatsby. They never speak of the off balance, really modern relationship of Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker. Carraway is by far the character to watch, and the one that makes this book interesting. His constantly changing relationship to Gatsby is strictly human. Reading this book from the twenties is like reading a book from the nineties. ""The Great Gatsby"" was far ahead of its time, and so was Nick Carraway and the relationships flooded throughout the book.The gossip aspect is very modern as well. Everyone at Gatsby's parties follow him around because of mystery. And that's what Jay Gatsby is about. Mystery. Even when the book is over, you never fully understand him.Overall, a great book, but not the best ever."
1,terrible product! avoide it!,"It only charges for 20 minutes and not even half charged.You can take 10 pictures with them, it is useless! Speaked to vidpro, they are aware of the problems. They asked me to ship them back and pay $9 shipping and handling for replacements. The total cost comes to $20 if I want get it exchanged. It's not worth that. it is absolutely a terrible experience!"
5,Great Battery,"I have a Minota Dimage 7 digital camera. It drained the 1600 mAh like u never seen before. But with this 2100mAh rechargeable, I believe it would leave marks on the energizer bunny on the go go go."
1,Where is the power?,I regret that I purchased these batteries and the charger. All I can say is that the batteries don't hold a charge. A wasted $40.00
4,The most comprehensive test book I've seen.,"I was impressed and a bit overwhelmed by the level of questioning in this book. Doing the practice tests (with Mosby's medical encyclopedia at my side!) helped me to over prepare for the national exam and made me realize how much more I have yet to learn. Some of the questions were misleading in terms of their wording, yet overall I would say it was very helpful. It lacks questioning for shiatsu and acupressure points and locations, which there were many on the national exam. Overall, I am glad I purchased it over the other study guides I saw. This one at least offers more information than you'll actually need to know. It 's a bit of overkill but in a good way."
4,Good reference for National Certification Test,"I found this book to be helpful in studying for the NCETMB. This book helped me to focus on the types of questions to study for. It was well-organized and showed me what I needed to study more. If you really want a great study guide get the following which is also on amazon.com:The Ultimate Study Guide for the National Certification Examination for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork: Key Review Questions and Answers by Patrick LeonardiVolume 1, Volume 2, and Volume 3These study guides showed the kind of questions the national certification test asked. These study guides took away a lot of surprise questions on the test, otherwise, I would not have known or prepared for."
1,I waited so long for THIS?,This album promised so much... or at least Myer did. And what did I get... a style so far away from Haujobb previous glory that I almost through the CD away. The only thing that reminds me that this CD *IS* from Haujobb is Myers voice. He really never was a great singer. Now it is time that somebody tells him!
1,One word: disaster,"I remember listening to my first Haujobb CD clearly; it was an experience that still goes on. With this CD I can also tell you that this is my last Haujobb CD. This band had its time, and impressed the entire industrial community.Now they have reached the point where inspiration is gone, and where the singer (Meyer?) clearly has lost touch with reality: his singing is embarrasing and as stated by another reviewer WAAAY out of tune many many times. In none of the tunes can I find the sound of the REAL Haujobb, the sound from Solutions for a small planet and former CD's. This CD sounds more like Cleaner, Meyers sideproject which has also reached the bottom.Dear reader, it is time to find new bands and new CD's, because Haujobb is no longer the leader of the pack, it is a waste of time and money, and for Meyer and co. it is no doubt close to the end of Haujobb era."
2,dissapointed,"would he plz stop the singing. please. I liked nightynine alot because there was very little singing. The album was very intelligent. The production was top notch and I thought it showed alot of growth from their previous releases. Solutions was also good, even tho the guy was singing alot more. I could deal with the it alot better then with this album. The album also sounded fresh and inovative. Dont get me wrong, the beats and synths are pretty nice on Polarity, but I was expecting more. The lead singer on the other hand is just plain bad at parts on this disc. I wish he would just throw away his mic or something, and focus on the music. Get that female vocalist from nightynine back or something. Anything. If it wasnt for the singing I would have given this a 4."
1,This band is not interesting anymore,There are so many other new industrial CDs from year 2001 that you should consider buying. Haujobb has no value anymore!
1,This singer cannot sing... or compose tunes,"and that what makes this CD so awfull, don't spend your money on this CD before you've heard it."
5,NO COMPLAINTS,"Polarity is probably Haujobb's most structured and commercial release to date. It sounds a lot like their 1996 hit album, Solutions For A Small Planet with hints of their last album, NinetyNine. I feel that this is the perfect fusion of laid back minimal electronics with moments of fast-paced, harsh techno. Dan Myer has also improved on his vocals and added some emotion. It is very obvious that Haujobb are the true leaders of the EBM sub-genre in the dying world of industrial music. Great songs are: Boom Operator, Subsonic, Unseeing, and my personal favorite, Violator. The only song I don't care for is Your Pilot. This is the perfect album for newcomers to Haujobb and devoted fans like myself. Next, try Solutions and NintyNine. Even though this album will never get radio or TV air time, this artful band will always continue to release great music under the ever so fabulous Metropolis Records."
4,One of Haujobb's best,"The title is deeply ironic -- this is the album that polarized Haujobb fans, with the supporters on one end and the detractors on the other. Ignore the detractors. They're wrong.The difference between Polarity and older albums is that he has toned down the distortion on the vox and is alternating between speaking and singing, and if you're not listening carefully it can occasionally come off as being slightly out-of-tune. But the composition of this album is nothing short of masterful, even if most of the early songs are just William Gibson sentence fragments. He does have a misstep or two -- the otherwise excellent ""Demon"" has an annoying vocal effect that takes some getting used to, and ""Violator"" is a pseudo-ballad with lyrics that make me cringe. The highlights are more than enough to overlook these faults, as every other song is a full masterpiece. If you like Haujobb and you're amenable to some drum n' bass influences, then there is no way you could resist this."
3,its grip just couldnt hold me for long...,"I was riveted when I first heard this album. I had never heard of Haujobb before and was simply amazed by what they had put out. It was such a breath of fresh air after a long swim in gritty harsh :Wumpscut: and the innovative but slightly poppy Apoptygma Berzerk. Here was a style I had never heard before. However, after hearing some of their other albums, Polarity just could not hold my attention anymore, and I am loathe to put it in my player over Solutions for a small planet, '99, or Vertical Theory. I give it 3 stars. Its kind of a progression between albums. Myers was experimenting with yet another change in Haujobbs sound but he didnt quite get it right. He comes much closer to perfection in his follow-up; Vertical Theory.Thats my two cents. Peace."
1,Haujobb reached its peak a long time ago..,"and now Haujobb has reached the bottom. Start listening to SOLUTIONS FOR A SMALL PLANET, then try the CDs that came before SOLUTIONS. Then you can give the 1999 a shot. They lost the touch with their own innovative style, and can only produce boring, soulless tunes, and as if that was not bad enough, Meyers singing is emphasized to a new level. He's an awfull singer, and destroys the tunes completely. Haujobb is no more, do listen to this CD before you buy!"
4,pretty damn good,"id have to say this is the one haujobb cd that i like generally all the songs off of. solutions for a small planets had some really good songs but some really awful ones as well. i like the balance of mysterious strings and minor notes that really put you in another curious world. however my one complaint about this is there could be a little more originality in variations between the different tracks. though the album is well rounded, it doesnt have as quite as many mind blowingly extravagant songs as their earlier albums such as freeze frame reality. intros and interludes were better on the earlier albums as well. nevertheless still an excellent album."
3,"An Average Book. Some good details, at times tedious.",A lot of the information is given in metric system. Pricing information is given in the British Pound. Much of the information given is very good and the advise he gives is sound in regards to binocular size. There are many instances when the subject mater drags and I found myself drifting off or jumping ahead.
4,"Nice book, but incomplete","This book is a review of Coke advertising during WWII. It's fairly complete, but missing some ads. Each ad takes 1 page, and is acompanied by the author's notes. No mention of other Coca-Cola wartime productions, such as the Heaslip ""Airplane Hangers"" or spotter cards. I wish it had covered these other items, since they relate more directly to the war than the ads."
2,poorly organized,"The problem that I have with this book is that often the words that it defines tells me to go look up another fine. That would be fine, except that I go to the word it said to look up and discover that I either have to look up another word. This book is not helpful in that respect, and given that a lot of PCs run Windows, it doesn't really make sense to release a hypertext version for the Mac but not one for Windows. So the Windows users are stuck with a book that really isn't that good."
2,"Beautiful videography, needs more research and exploration","I had to watch this movie for my University history class. I thought that the videography was great, beautiful scenery etc, but I ended up having to rent this one again just so I could rewind to catch all the parts I couldn't understand due to Gerard Depardieu's accent. Why do did they have a Frenchman playing an Italian in Spain, but speaking English. We as a class decided that there was a lot of Historical inacurracy, not only in events as they happen in the movie, but also in the character of Columbus as well. Sorry folks. He was the not NICE GUY that this film makes him out to be. I also felt that they needed to explore a bit more into the tensions of the crew during the voyage and after landing. This would have made those scenes much better. I recommend this film for the beautiful scenery and the good acting (albeit hard to understand sometimes), but I would not recommend it if you are a stickler for historical truth."
3,Worth a viewing.,"I thought that 1492: Conquest of Paradise was pretty good. This film was well-made and the cinematography and acting were better-than-average. I do admit that I thought that the movie was slow going in places though and I sometimes didn't understand some things that the actor playing Christopher Columbus said. The soundtrack performed by Vangelis is good also. I doubt I'll watch this again, but I still think it was technically well-made and worthy of a viewing."
3,1492,"Title: 1492 Conquest of ParadiseNo in 16:9... ! Very good movie, great actor and great director but we expected in 16:9 TV format..."
4,1492 rocks wih Columbo,"If you like history, gore and adventure this is the movie for you. Throughout the movie Columbus is portrayed differently and has multiple challenging situations that lead to a new civilization on what they thought was a new world. The movie tells the story of Columbus along with the battles he fought with his men against the natives. Also there are traitors among some of Columbus's men which make the movie interesting and fun to watch."
3,Columbus was Italian- NOT FRENCH,"The scenery was beautiful but the actor was French. Excluding the casting of the director's daughter in Godfather III, Columbus could not have been any more poorly portrayed."
3,"Rich history, Lavish scenery, Tiresome plot","This is a great piece of Historical Fiction, I believe that it represents Christopher Columbus to a tee! I liked the cast, many of these actors are famous and a good number of supporting roles I recognized from other films. The beginning is a bit boring but don't let that stop you from seeing it. Illustrious and exciting!"
1,Greatness in its grasp but wastes it all on subtleness.,I have never been so bored in my entire life. I do enjoy some of the works of Ridley Scott ( Alien ) but this movie had me sleeping before the second tape. What a waste of a tremendous actor.
3,Beautiful played historical lie....,I would be recomend watch this film only if you interested in very good play performed by very experienced team of actors...End if you like musik of Vangelis who wrote it for this film...That is a good side of this movie...Now let's start about bad side of movie...First: American continent was originaly open by vikings...Second: Columbus kiled tousends indians for gold...Third: This movie give peoples wrong historical view what made knowledge of history very poor among school students...This last one is actually most important issue...How many times I russian immigrant find out about poor knowledge of own history by peoples in USA...
4,Realistc or Idealistc Conquest?,"We could clearly see that there were many occurrences that the writers left out in Conquest of Paradise. Here, we see an idealistic version of what occurred after Christopher Columbus discovered the New world. The writers produced a cross-word puzzle that, us, the viewers were able to put together before the climax of the movie developed with intensity. I enjoyed the money greatly, yet I was expecting to se the other side of the Conquest, the horrible side. I wanted the rest of the audience to understand that the results of the conquest was not as pleasant as we have told our children. In Conquest of Paradise Gérard Depadieu is portrayed as a hero, or so we are led to think, yet we don't have a chance to see the other version of the story. I was expecting to see how the indigenous culture basically came to be extinct; how their religion was disregarded and Christianity was implemented. We don't see this in this movie; we only see one side of the dilemma."
5,"""Conquest of Paradice""","Although I never saw the movie, I fell in love with the sound track the first time I heard it. For about two years I checked every video shop I could find with no luck. It never dawned on me to check Amazon.Com for a video but there it was. Everything went as promised and the video arrived two days early.Many thanks, I look forward to more purchases, you make it so easy."
1,Doesn't work in the US market!,I don't think Amazon should market this without clearer warnings that this is not appropriate for the North American zone equipment
2,1492 import,I bought the import DVD and it appears to be a digitized version of the VHS widescreen. The image quality is very poor. Cover of the package appears blurry and seems more like a home-made duplication rather than a real off-the-press original. It doesn't do Ridley's film justice.
4,1492 Conquest of Paradise,The movie 1494 Conquest of Paradise was and educational and entertaining picture. He showed Columbus to be a determined man. The scenery was incredible. The palm trees and the water falls gave it a natural look. The wild life was incredible. Costumes for the queen and for the Indians were extrodinary. The dramatic fight scenes were very entertaining. This movie deserves four out of five stars. This movie is not a movie for children. It had very graphic fighting scenes.
4,Movie Critique,"I liked the movie Conquest of Paradise. It gave a truthful and untainted view of Columbus. The cinematography gives the movie depth. I feel that unlike most Columbus movies this one does not lie about how heroic Columbus was. Though Columbus can be looked up to as a hero, this movie showed the darker side of him not usually portrayed in many movies. I did not like the parts where there was extreme violence and though it did effect the movie, I feel that it should not be as graphic. I thought as a plus it was very historically accurate especially the costuming and scenery"
3,Susie's reveiw of 1492,FILM CRITIC MY OPPINION OF THE MOVIE WAS THAT I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GREAT. I DO HAVE A BIT OF A SUGGESTION IF YOU DO NOT LIKE BLOOD AND GORE THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. FOR AN EXAMPLE WHEN THE GUY GETS HIS HAND CUT OFF. BUT THE MOVIE WAS HISTORICALLY ACURATE AND TO LEARN HOW COLUMBUS AND HIS CREW NAVIGATE AND SEE HOW FAST THEY ARE GOING IS FASCINATING.
2,Gimme a break!,"First of all, Gerard Depardieu is OBVIOUSLY FRENCH! I don't believe Christopher Columbus talked like Inspector Clousseau! They could have at least attempted to be historically accurate. The film also makes it look like he was some beneficiary of the natives, though he was the one who ordered their enslavement in most cases to search for gold for his own wealth and standing."
2,I am Gerard Depardieu,"I am not very pleased with my, hagh hagh, ""performance"" in this movie. Even though many feel it was my best, I think this is primarily due to my, hagh hagh, shirtless-ness, especially for, hagh hagh, 4 and a half, how do you say, hours. I am french,just wait till my next movie, where I practice the vaunted, hagh hagh, French tradition of eating a baby,Gerard"
1,barely watchable on two fronts,"By many accounts, this movie was poorly made; certainly not one of Ridley Scott's finest moments.The second reason this movie is not good is its take on historical fiction. Columbus is portrayed as a tolerant and patient man, kind to the natives. He also portrayed as a man of science. Nothing could be further from the truth. The first thing Columbus did was write about enslaving the natives and showed little to no concern for their welfare. While Columbus utilized the most advanced technology of the time, he put most of his faith in religion and mysticism - hardly the characteristics of a man of reason and science.Historical fiction can be forgiven if it is entertaining (like Scott's Gladiator). But going too far by including many historical inaccuracies (like The Patriot) distracts from an otherwise good movie (like The Patriot). Unfortunately, this movie combines the worst of both: not entertaining or historically accurate."
1,cannot see this on my new dvd player,I have to send this back. Cannot see it as it says Wrong region. Please email me asap about how tosend it back or if you can help me correct it on my dvd player.. Sue
3,Not comparable to Alone Together,"Dave Mason's 1970 release, Alone Together, is an absolute classic. This album, originally released in 1973, was a must for my collection as I'm a huge fan of Dave Mason, but unfortunately, it doesn't compare very favorably to his 1970 release. Credit is due to the song Misty Morning Stranger--it is excellent--but the rest is fairly mediocre."
5,Cool Christian message as well,"Did any one ever hear this as a cool Christian Cd as well? I know she's said that it was inspired by God, so I was just wandering if any one has used it for kids in church? It's a great message and reminder of how we need to ""keep the faith alive""Mattyd"
5,Love this song,"I love this song. It is positive, it is powerful, it reaches me. Isn't that what music is supposed to do? Mission accomplished. Whatever this songwriter puts out, I'm going to buy. I believe in her message. I believe in her music. i believe in her. Bravo girl!"
5,a keeper...,"Not only does it pass the time-test, it refreshes.My favorite Daniel Day-Lewis, so believable and punchy, as lover and ultimately peacenik. (And delivers one of the most poetic lines in Christendom to his long-lost 'girl')Now I've gifting my Irish femily with this DVD -- in front of March 17."
5,The Boxer,"This movie role of a struggling boxer was brilliantly acted by Daniel Day Lewis. It's a love story about a man who wants to move on with his life after being imprisoned physically and emotionally, and a woman who is tied to her past."
2,dvd format,"dvd wouldn't work in my dvd player..dvd player screen read..will not play this format,returned to amazon..refund was prompt and without question..i thank amazon for their good customer service..tom"
1,Not in the same league as Sheridan's first three features,"'In The Name of the Father' played a dangerous game in changing some of the facts of the Guildford Four case for 'artistic' reasons, but it still made dramatic sense. This story of a boxer returning to republican Belfast as a ceasefire is being brokered (and simultaneously undermined) fails to make sense either politically or dramatically.The tired cliches of the released prisoner trying to go straight, and IRA godfathers struggling with young hot-heads for control of their organisation, are all in there. Surprisingly, the acting was no better than fair, with dodgy accents from Brian Cox and Emily Watson. I wanted to like the film, but I just couldn't believe in its story.For a far better working of similar material try Michael Winterbottom's BBC TV play 'Love Lies Bleeding', starring Mark Rylance.CJF"
5,Daniel Day Lewis and Emily Watson are extraordinary,"together. Their love scenes are some of the most honest, intelligent and erotic ever filmed. Watson plays a woman I can actually identify with, as well as respect--which is a rarity. And, although this film isn't nearly as great as the two previous Sheridan-Day Lewis collaborations, both of them do things we've never seen before. It is one of the few films in recent years that is definitely worth watching, and can be recommended to friends, with a good conscience."
1,A tale of moral relativism,"I saw this film, with high expectations, in the theater. I thought Sheridan had done a good, though not great, job on ""In the Name of the Father,"" capturing some of the reality of the Irish situation.""The Boxer"" has no appealing characters. Brian Cox comes closest. The British are portrayed in the age-old, inaccurate role of ""honest brokers"" among the irrational, bloodthirsty Irish stereeotypes. The IRA man trying to mess up Cox's peace initiative seems to represent Sheridan's attempt to wrap up a goofy and unwieldy plot.As the choppy plot unfolded, I expected that at least the Day-Lewis character would resist adultery with his friend's wife. This struggle, though nearly lost in the unlikely political plot, was the most compelling thing in the movie. Unfortunately, the film dashed even that minimal expectation. Day-Lewis rekindles his romance with a woman who is married to his imprisoned friend. So why should the audience empathize with these characters?"
4,Excellent,"The Litter had made two albums before this one,$100 FineandDistortions. Both were excellent stripped down garage rock.Emerge is not. The guitars are heavier here--much heavier. Comparing the first two albums to Emerge is like comparing the Troggs to Blue Cheer; both rock, but you'll never get them confused. Fuzz and more tracking give this album a weight and a pound that distinguish it.Dynamics also play a bigger part here: there is more eccho, and loud/soft contrast. Some songs give distortion attack, followed by creeping bass or sneeking guitar. Like its chromokey album cover, Emeger keeps you crawling through light and shadow.But the songs are well composed, and all studio enhancement does not go to waste. The music itslef rests solid, and the recording only tightens its already iron grip."
5,The Litter-Emerge,"Released in early 1969, The Litter album ""Emerge"" is one of the great albums from the period when psychedelia merged into a heavier direction musically. I am reminded of a Lester Bangs article on heavy metal describing how mid 1960s garage bands transformed into hard rock/heavy metal later on and The Litter (much like MC5) fit this profile very accurately. The guitar distortion was still evident, but the tone was much sharper, guitar solos more abrasive and prominent, bass and drums, much deeper and the vocals are well mixed. The songs were longer (the epic ""Future of the Past"") and less radio friendly in a non underground FM sense, but are nonetheless memorable and powerful. The Litter could definitely hold their own among their American and British counterparts of the time when it came to raw energy and heaviness. I have had Emerge for decades on LP and was glad to finally get it on CD. A great find I have wanted to have on CD for years."
3,my little red book,I think that that song just purely captures the sound of the sixties.I believe that maybe Burt Bacharch wrote the song.
3,"Good, But..","This perfume smells wonderful but I was disappointed that the 1.0 oz. bottle I ordered came in a travel-size version that was an opaque white cylinder, not the pretty glass bottle with the dove cap that I was looking forward to receiving."
2,Newer info needed,"I was disappointed, as I was looking for a specific surname. What was written about it was uninformed. Other more prominent family names may be better researched, but the Newburgh name was not."
3,Less Than Expected,"I want a dictionary that gives the pronounciation of names, but this does not do that. It does have brief interesting information about the name."
3,underwhelmed,"My 5 year old was underwhelmed by this gift.When I bought it I didn't understand how large the pieces were. From the pictures I was thinking they were small, lego-sized pieces. But they are larger -- think Duplo sized or larger. So it has a more ""preschool"" feel than I was expecting.More importantly, my son created a few interesting creatures but the pieces attach so loosely that none were able to stand up by themselves...they'd all collapse.They also weren't as versatile as some building toys. I guess I was picturing a sort of dinosaur-themed Bionicle set.This toy is more fun than the similar ""Cootie"" toy from my childhood, but still not as fun as we'd hoped."
3,did not receive the book,There was a mix-up in titles and the seller qwert1945 did not have the book I ordered. They canceled the order.
3,Not the best of the series.,"I am an admirer of Reginald Hill. His characters, Dalziel and Pascoe, have helped me spend many happy hours with their adventures. This, however, is not his best moment. The book focuses on the disappearance of young girls. Illness of Pascoe's daughter sharpens the feelings for the loss of a child. Little is made of the motivation of the perpetrator or any reason behind the disappearances. One is left with feelings of great dissatisfaction at the conclusion. I would recommend other books in the series."
5,Takes you to new heights,"A doomed Yorskshire Valley waiting to be flooded, missing girls and the legend of Benny's Back, what can all this mean to Dalziel 15 years down the track, well it looks like Benny is back and another little girl has gone missing in similar circumstances, Dalziel must retrace his steps 15 years back when he was involved in the search for the missing girls. Pascoe has his own problems with his own little girl which will somehow tie everything together. This book was quite an exhaustive read with so much going on in the present and the past, how can the drowning of a valley so long ago mean so much to everyone involved in the present day? This book has so many turns and red herrings that the only people I didn't suspect of murder were Dalziel and Pascoe. a thoroughly enjoyable read I give it five out of five. Another plus to this book is that it gives you an interest in exploring the composer Mahler to see if the music mentioned in the book is available."
3,It had the promise of something more,"This could have been an excellent mystery - but the ending was unfortunately predictable and lame. Aside from the detectives, the remaining characters were one-dimensional and undeveloped. It's a shame because the writing is otherwise beautiful. Still, the book kept my attention and I managed to finish all 548 pages. It was exciting in some areas and I did care about the two main detectives. Overall, it wasn't as good as it good have been, but it certainly wasn't the worst mystery I have ever read!"
4,A Total Frenzy with a Foundation of Chaos,"This film is pandemonium. Disorder, Confusion, Turmoil, and Discord could very well be considered the supporting cast. The plot is a complete frenzy. Amongst all the craziness is the interest that you will find most enjoyable. This movie will make you laugh, it will make you gasp, and it will make you imagine yourself in the main character's shoes. The foundation of this film is a struggle between adolescence and adulthood. This film will be most enjoyed by those who find themselves fighting the same struggle. It will be most understood by those who realize that they are leaving the teenage years and need to find they place in society as an adult. Whether you completely understand or not, this film is still fun. You may not get the most enjoyment out of it if you don't truly understand it, but it is entertaining to watch nonetheless. I rate this film four out of five stars."
4,Read the Book,"Read the book by Irvine Welsh if you liked the movie--a masterpiece by a very talented and fresh author. By the way, Welsh appears in the movie as the drug dealer ""Mikey""."
3,The College DVD Fan's Collectable,"I view this film as being on the same level as ""High Fidelity""; far too calculating to be brilliant, but so well-crafted, I can't help liking it.There's no question it's disturbing, and given the subject matter, it's not surprising it wasn't the big hit Mirimax's marketing department expected it to be. But all that aside, some solid performances by Ewan MacGregor, Robert Carlyle, and Kevin McKidd.It's endlessly quotable, which lends to its perpetual cult status, and despite being a bit long, is definitely worth a rental."
5,All I can say is: oh my god!,"I watched this and I thought to meself..Man, that's sick...But I've watched it 30 or 40 times. It's a movie for people who like strange things, more of an acquired taste than anything. Ewan McGregor is absolutely brillant and perfectly cast for the role of our heroic (?) and drug addicted narrator ""Renton"". The characters are, by no means, sterling examples of humanity but they're fascinating and irresistable. Some parts show drug use in graphic detail and can make your skin crawl so watcher be aware. Other than that it's hilarious and will have you changing your pronunciation of several words because the Scottish way is just more fun:)"
5,Fantastic!!,"With the beat of a drum, a Scottish voice, and a fast paced run through the streets we embark on the hilarious junkie film known as Trainspotting. The so-called-mates are well portrayed by a group of extremely talented Scottish actors, and by far my all time favourite film. The Green Version would be a well appreciated addition to Amazon.com's extensive movie library."
2,Not for everyone over 30,"Yes, it is a very well-done movie. It is one of extremes. If you can handle life in the low levels of the drug scene, then watch this one. If you prefer a more upbeat story, look elsewhere. I loved the Matrix, and this is nothing like it. I give it a 2 for subject matter/content."
1,Realistic? I don't EVEN think so,Realistic drug addicts... who look like movie stars!! Yeah right! The Jonny Lee Miller character was always so doped up he had no time for anything else (letting his baby die of neglect) yet he somehow found the time to keep his baby-blonde hair perfectly bleached and coiffed.
5,Wow!,"I've seen this movie about 50 times now and every time I watch it, it gets better. Once you can understand the dialect and slang it truly becomes a great movie. If you like dark humor it's for you."
4,Wow!,"I thought this movie was totally cool! From the beginning to the end I didn't know what to expect. It began as a humorous film and the moods were continually changing from laughter to sadness, back to laughter. Even though I loved the movie I suggest previewing it before you buy it. The worst Toilet in Scottland scene made my face turn a little green. :-)"
3,Good Movie -- Bad DVD,"It's a fine film. We've already established this.The US release of the DVD however, is not so good. There is 1 single feature on this version of the DVD, and it's the movie. At $.. (and even at the sale price), this is a rip. This was a first generation DVD, so even though the sound is Dolby 5.1, it's far from spectacular.If you're going to buy this movie on DVD, get the Canadian Special Edition (Alliance). It contains trailers, deleted footage, and interviews, at approx $... US. And it is Region 1, NTSC. You can find it around on foreign or Canadian online DVD stores like ... or ...."
3,REVIEW FOR THE LIONSGATE BLU VERSION,"Just a heads-up that the newly released Lionsgate Blu of Trainspotting is not the same version as was released on 2-Disc DVD a number of years ago. It's a mixture of the Miramax theatrical and the true Director's Cut. None of the dialogue is dubbed but the two shots edited from the US version (Diane on top of Renton and the needle going into Renton's arm) are not here. Picture is moderately better than an upconverted DVD. If you are looking for the true version seen in the UK and on the Criterion laserdisc, either hold on to your old 2-Disc DVD or seek it out used as it's now out of print. Otherwise, I would recommend paying no more than $10 for this or avoid altogether. I like Lionsgate very much but sometimes they drop the ball. This is one of those times."
4,Daring to do what Hollywood doesn't,"A film which educates and ultimately deters people from the use of Heroin. A film which successfully threads humour with shocking realism.It was said in Britain that the Americans weren't reasy for this movie, and by it's realtively unknown status in the US that would seem a relavant point. Maybe it's the Scottish accents, or the far-from-hollywood feel of the film, but for the rest of us, this is a well-made and thought provoking film."
5,for specific tastes.,"Some people see the first scene of the movie and immediately dismiss it as another over the top drug glamorization free for all. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trainspotting presents a rather realistic take on life with heroin; it is dark, funny, disgusting, sad, and disturbing. Though not a particularly good influence and certainly not a family film, Trainspotting is a must-see for all young people 18 and older."
1,Most depressing film ever....!,"This is the most depressing film ever!...There is not one redeeming factor, that has any impact on the audience. Robert Carlyle's character, where he randomly beats the crap out of folks that he gets in a brawl with is so terribly annoying!!! Unless, if you really have no direction in life, or lavish a sadistic, twisted nature, then this movie is by all means for you..."
1,MY REVIEW,"DVD was scratched and I was unable to watch the entire film, very angry, I would return except you can't send back open CDS/DVDS."
1,prepare to be bored and depressed,This movie is about a bunch of addicts who kill their baby and are totally sociopathic. Gee what a vision of a film. I watched it because of great reviews. I must not have gotten it.If you need to see a movie find anything else. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
1,no thanks,"after hearing about how 'great' this movie was and seeing all the good reviews, i finally rented it. and i HATED it. i hate this movie more than any other movie i've ever seen. i can't exactly tell you why...the characters were boring, and worthless, I didn't feel any sympathy for them at all. This movie just glorified drug use. bleh. i'll give it 1 star for ewan."
1,One of the worst films ever made,"Okay, so after rejecting this one out of hand for years because I hated every band on the soundtrack, I finally decided to give it a try. And afterwards, I not only hate every band on the soundtrack and every song they contributed, I also hate the movie. If you want to see a really good movie about the horrors of drug use, you'd do a lot better with the recognized classic in the genre, Drugstore Cowboy. This is old territory, only worth going over if you find some redeeming quality in the music."
3,A great classic,There's no way this could escape my bluray collection. Great quality and cool bonus material. Not much difference from it's dvd edition. Too bad the extras came in standard def. Still is a pretty good film to have as part your collection.
3,And now for something completely different,"I can't think of anything to say concerning this movie without having to give a spoiler alert. I will say however, if you are bored of the run of the mill Hollywood production, give this movie a viewing. Like cleansing your palate at a wine tasting, it will refresh your taste in movies."
5,A cinematic high,"Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his cronies (Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, and Robert Carlyle) are young (mostly) heroin addicts in economically depressed Edinburgh of the 90s. This film follows their lives, particularly Renton as he drifts in and out of the straight life.By avoiding any strident proselytizing or easy judgments and simply portraying the addicted lifestyle in a closely observed, pragmatic style, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge have produced one of the most powerful statements against drug use ever put on screen. But don't let that put you off by making the film seem like a downer. It also features some of the most exuberant filmmaking I've ever seen and a masterful wedding of music with subject manner. It's also rare to see a film so successfully combine harrowing scenes of appalling behavior with laugh out loud comedic moments. Highly recommended."
1,The Baby,"It was...uh, different. The effects were bad on the baby on the ceiling scence, but what are you going to do about it? Ewan did play his role well but I must say his charactor was the most not the most likable. I suggest you skip this one..and maybe the 2nd on the is soon to be filmed."
3,Gross but interesting,"While a gross-out scene may be the most memorable part of this film, it does paint a pretty realistic portrait of highly disorganized young heroin addicts. I've known a lot of heroin addicts in the course of my career (none in Scotland, however) and only a few of them were as far gone in their addiction as the young characters of this movie. While most make some very bad choices on a regular basis, few would go as far as this film suggests."
5,Fairly intense portrayal of addiction,"THis is a film worth watching if you're interested in the reality of addiction, and how it makes people almost incapable of overcoming their problems. It's also got some humorous bits."
4,Worth watching,"I thought this was a great movie. I don't have such intimate personal experience, but it seemed to me to show a fairly realistic view of the life of an addict. I have heard various people say that this movie glorifies drug use. I think that this is like saying that showing car crashes glorifies driving. I thought the movie was well done and engrossing, though not necessarily entertaining."
4,Amazing movie,"This is probably the most realistic movie I have seen in a long time. It left me feeling shocked by the horror that occurs outside the white-class, middle-class society. It had a stinging bite of reality. But the end of the movie left me hopeful that good can come out of such situations. It is one movie I plan on watching many times."
4,Choose SOmething !,"This movie is completely sick , a total gross out no holds barred film about heroin addiction, the way it should be. Heroin is not chic nor glamorous as is neither drug addiction, but the movie is sharp, fast and funny. The cast is great and the SOundtrack as well. Drugstore Cowboy with techno."
2,"man, did I get old or what?","Ummm, I remember hearing about this movie when I was an undergrad back in '96. I didn't get to watch it back then, but I finally have been able to see the movie. All I can think is that I am 30 something, and this didn't appeal to me. The humor was off the mark for me a bit, but I still couldn't say that the movie is bad. Its just for the younger crowd. So if you are 20ish, it will be good for you."
5,Take this for what it is.,"Arlene could be commentary, but why make it so complicated? This is a great book with brilliant artwork that young children love because things are made very obvious. I reconciles the fact that all the kids' books and cartoons personify small creatures and animals with the fact that we eat those smelly little things. It's a hilarious gift for most adults, unless of course they are the overly-sensitive mom-type. I personally enjoy reading this to children and friends alike."
5,"Gorgeous artwork, creative text","Sick of sappy stories about teddy bears, bunnies, and tea parties? Arlene Sardine, a favorite story in our household, fills the void. The artwork is gorgeous and the story is realistic and fun. Added plus: your child will understand the word ""hermetically""!"
2,Bizarre,"I am a children's librarian. Chris Raschka is a talented illustrator and artist, as he proved with books like ""Yo? Yes!"" However, success has made him, like Sendak, think he can do whatever odd thing he feels like, and his publishers seem to concur. As a result, we get this weird, morbid thing that critics may like but which no child will. The art is interesting."
4,Perhaps the quirkiest children's book I've read.,"I laughed out loud. Quite a bit.The illustrations are great and my 2-year-old is fascinated.Take it for what it is and don't read too much into it. It's worth a look, if for no other reason than that it's quite unique."
4,You can really have fun with this book,"I've been reading this book to my 3 1/2 year old for the past year now and he still really enjoys the story and its illustrations. The illustrations are a little impressionistic, which I think add some complexity to what the reader is looking at. I think this makes it a little more interesting and a nice change of pace on occasion. Arlene is the fish with the red dot on her cheek and my son loves to look for her on each page. I think it also teaches kids not to be afraid of death. After reading about it in various books (including the classic The Lady Who Swallowed a Fly), he knows that it can happen and it's a part of life. It's not something shocking to him and he's not afraid of it. The author describes Arlene's death, and what happens to her in her journey to becoming a sardine, in a very playful manner. This book is definitely a worthwhile addition to any child's book collection."
1,Arlene's one goal in life (or death?) is to be a sardine.,"So Arlene ""decides"" her goal in life (or is it death?) is to be a sardine. How ridiculous! Does a calf decide to be a sirloin steak? What lesson does this teach children about life and death? That death is a choice - an option to be selected at a young age? I work in a public library. We recently lost an 18 year old member of our staff to suicide. Is this the conscious choice we want our children to be making - to wish for death- to be stuffed in a can with no air to breathe. Our library staff has unanimously decided to omit this book from our collection."
2,A GOOD ATTEMPT GONE BAD,"I admire Chris Raschka for his willingness to take creative risks. He certainly does that here. But in abruptly killing off the protoganist midway through the story, he seems to be taking aim not just at the character, but at the reader. It's a loathesome move. Books for even the youngest kids can and should contain the darker undercurrents of life, including death. But this book fails to broach the subject in an honest, responsible way. It's simply using death as a device to shock and provoke. That's not appropriate for adults and it's not appropriate for kids. (...)."
1,Horrible and unsuiting for children!,"Arlene Sardine is a life and Death story about a sardine named Arlene who doesn't know that she is a sardine and for some reason she wishes she was a sardine then she gets cought in a net and dies. Some children are very sensitive and they will burst out crying in a ""SNAP!"" and for the children who don't start crying and start laughing all parents know thats not a good sign."
5,Excellent in every way!,"I ordered these tanks in 6 colors. I am 5'8"", usually a 12/14 and was seeking a longer tank to layer under shorter tops I already owned. They are exactly as pictured, although I would describe the 'stone' as more of a traditional 'nude' and the 'neon pink' as a bright pink coral(but not neon). They are long enough to comfortably layer and light as a feather. The fabric clings and gathers in all the right places with plenty of stretch. The shipping was quick, I could not be happier with this purchase and won't hesitate to order more. I highly recommend this tank to big and tall women that have trouble finding tops that are long enough."
4,Overall a great layering piece,"I am 5'4"" and a size 6. I bought these for layering, and they are great. The length is perfect, enough to peek out from the bottom if you want or long enough to stay tucked in for rear coverage with those low-waisted pants. The colors are rich and colorfast in the wash. The straps stay up, and chest and side-boob coverage is excellent, making these my first choice for layering under casual dresses and cardigans. They also make great sleepwear.I do experience some rolling up with these around the belly, but maybe that's just because of my post-baby pooch. They also are lint magnets in the wash, so I have to use the lint roller regularly. I deducted one star for these reasons."
5,My favorite cami ever,"Tall women will love this one...long enough to tuck in pants and stay. Fabric is form fitting and it washes without fading. At this price, you can order them in all different colors!"
3,Far from perfect ....,"I've been looking for the perfect layering tank, so I was excited when I saw the rave reviews for this cami. Hesitant, I only ordered 1 (figuring if it was great, I'd buy a few colors). I was SADLY disappointed when it arrived. The neon green is a FANTASTIC bright color and the material is stretchy, soft, and thick, so it earns a few stars, BUT ... 1) the straps are TOO short! The cami rides too high on the chest and back, deep inside the armpit. I expect after a few wears, it will rip at the front seam. 2) it's TOO long. I have to bunch it up at the waist to wear it tucked in jeans. (otherwise, it would hit far below the butt) I'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34C. Perhaps I got a dud, but I have no idea how it fit everyone else. At least I only got one- it costs too much to return. Sad- it could have been perfect."
3,basic cami,"I bought this cami in black,brown,rust and stone. They appear to by really stretchy and they seem to wash well. I have tried 1 on just to get an idea of how it would fit. It seems to want to roll up when you wear them by themselves. Probably would make a better layering cami unless you tuck it into whatever bottoms your wearing."
3,Nice basic cami for layering,"I picked up this camisole in a variety of colors. It's very basic, nothing fancy, but it does the job. The camisole is nice and long, and works well for layering. Some of the lighter colors are a little on the sheer side, so I wouldn't wear by themselves, but the darker colors don't seem to have that problem (at least not as much). I bought them to layer as well as to wear to bed. I just had twins in May, so I wanted alternatives to my nursing tops and bras to wear around the house that would still provide easy access for nursing (I go through a lot of changes in a day, with spit-up and whatnot), and this camisole definitely fits the bill. Though, buyers should keep in mind that there's no shelf bra built-in, so support is pretty minimal. So, if you plan to wear these out and are reasonably endowed at all, you'll want extra support underneath. All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
4,"great, but pills","This is a top I wear all the time, under sweaters, open jackets. Good looking enough to layer. Great stretch, neutral color. The bad news? It pilled quickly. I washed it delicate cold and air dried. I will still wear it, but was surprised to see the material age so fast."
2,Not worth it,"I like the picture, but I ordered it yellow, it came neon green and it had a hole in the corner on the bottom. Not worth the cost."
3,Nice... but..,"I really like the way this fits and looks and it is really comfy. The problem I found is it snags very easily i.e you have a rough part on your fingernail and accidently catch it on the material. I have only had this a month or so and it looks kinda bad already. If you can be really careful not to snag it, it is a very nice tank."
3,NIce and Soft at first,"with a number of washes later they became dingy and other materials clung to them easily, especially the white one. Should have read the instructions for the first one I bought on the fact that these are hand wash... Do not like that factor. But found these for even cheaper and a nicer length and fit! [....]"
5,Fun show!,What will Nancy do next? What a ride! After the end of the first season I never dreamed the show would go in such random and creative directions. My friends and I love it.
1,WEEDS IS NOW A TOTAL BURN OUT,"LOVED SEASONS 1-3. HATED SEASONS 4-6. And Season 6 may be the worst season of all. The actors seem like they're sleeping walking through their roles, and who can blame them? The writing is absolutely pathetic this season. Season 6 has Nancy & the Family on the run and, boy, do they run. They never stop. Anytime the season starts to get even remotely interesting, like when they get hotel jobs in Seattle, boom, they're gone and on the run again. There's weird random graphic sex scenes with characters who have nothing to do with the story and which leads nowhere. In fact the whole season is pointless and really leads nowhere. No great new characters introduced. No fun juicy dramatic new stories to really get into. Just the family on the run being chased by drug dealers and the FBI. Really??? That's the best you TV writers can do? An entire season of that??? Boring. Totally boring. You get an F."
2,Weeds: Season Six continues to disappoint,"HUGE disappointment. I really enjoyed seasons 1 thru 4, so after season 5 (which also was a waste of time to watch), I took a chance on season 6. Another failure - even worse than season 5. This season showcases her as a lazy tramp and completely negligent mother. She spends the whole show foisting her baby onto her other children/brother in law - and drinking iced coffee. Just as the show seems it might pick up, they're on the run again. No real humor. Huge, huge, huge disappointment. If there are any further seasons, I won't waste my time or money on them. The producer/writers should be embarrassed."
2,Disc Holder Was Cracked,"The devise that holds the disc in place was broken off when I received it. Therefore, the disc never stays in place and will probably eventually break."
5,Another great season!,I can not get enough! I really enjoy this series! It is like a great book that you can't put down! Must have more!!
2,Disappointing season,"I have not purchased this from Amazon, but I have watched all the episodes. I wanted to leave a review to advise people against purchasing this. After following an excitement of 5 Seasons, I couldn't wait to see Season 6. I was so so disappointed. This was just one waste of my time. Nothing happens in any of this season except stupidity. I think at this point selling Nancy as a sex object is pretty ridiculous. Basically this whole season is the family on the run from Nancy's Mexican husband. They get in several very stupid situations. Nancy thinks she can use her sexuality to get her out of every situation, it just doesn't work any more at this point to me. The only thing exciting is the last episode when her husband catches up to her, you want to find out what happens next. That is about it. Save your money !!"
3,Weeds Season 6,"I've stuck by Nancy Botwin through thick and thin, but I think they have run out of story lines for Nancy and her brood.Its time for the writers to think of a really creative way to end this show and put us all out of our misery."
5,season 6 got me ready for season 7,this season left me wondering a lot of stuff... cant wait for season seven...so upset that season seven is the last one :(...
5,Weeds Season 6,Everybody should own this series. It is so addicting. I can only hope and wait for season 7. Next purchase should be all seasons of Breaking Bad -followed by Nurse Jackie.
3,Good for diehard fans,"If you can't get enough of the characters' antics, then you will enjoy this season. It's not as good as the seasons before it, but worth it if you really want to see the show all the way through. Amazon has a good price for it if you can't find it elsewhere."
5,Love,"My husband and I love this show. It really is very good, if sometimes unrealistic. I really enjoyed the first few seasons but felt like the later seasons were a little off the wall."
3,Still Watchable but getting a bit draggy,The first five seasons were so good but you can tell the show is slowly coming to an end and they are running out of ideas.
2,Broken,"When I ordered this I thought the price was okay, it took a few weeks to get here but when it got here it looked new,'however when I got the the 3rd disk I learned that it didn't play! There was a defect on the disk. I don't think this was the suppliers fault for say but it seemed like they maybe got cheap Product. The box was slightly damaged as well. It isn't the end of the world but I emailed my complaint and havnt gotten a response yet.. I guess we will see"
1,Ditch Weed,"Goddawful, Season Six of Weeds is so bad it doesn't deserve a complete review. I refuse to ""review"" a show that is obviously so budget-strapped due to presumed ""star-pay bloat"" that most of the sets are either inside a car or even more obnoxious and cheap-ass, IN PARKING LOTS!?Don't believe the shill hype, avoid this altogether, or at the very least if you are a Weeds fan (as I was), rent the first disc and see for yourself before buying the season. A pale, weak shadow of its former self."
2,no longer funny,In my humble opinion Weeds has lost not only it's way and but also it's humour. I found the sixth season boring and yearned for the amusing days of old.
2,What's happened to the packaging of the DVD's???,"DVD packaging in now just the cheap plastic cover with paper insert, all other seasons were the quality open up covers, much better"
3,Weeds Season 6,"OK, the writers are having some problems and have lost some of the shows luster.It gets slow and skatter brained in places. Hear their gonna be a move in the next season.If you a fan as I am its worth buying just to add to the collection. But Don't pay more than say $12 for this one."
2,Weeds Season Six,"Thoughts on Weeds:I started watching this show a couple years back, and I really liked it. I have watched season 1-6 so far, and overall, I find the show to be pretty good.Season Six:I really liked the first 4 or 5 seasons, but somewhere in there something changed for the worst. I really felt that this sixth season was the worst they have created so far, and I have actually decided to quit watching the show entirely. If I was rating the show from season 1 to 5, I would easily give it 5 stars because of how good the first few season were, but I would definitely quit watching after season 5."
5,awesome buy,this was an awesome season.. can't wait for the next 2 seasons. i hate to see the end of it
1,this season was bad,"I own all the other seasons but dont recommend this season, save your money. It was boring and not worth watching"
2,"Weeds, meet Shark, now jump","Not much left to this show except to see Mary Louise Parker naked I guess - maybe they can move the show to Cinemax.....This show really needs Elizabeth Perkins back, badly."
1,Hot and cool looking cover page is all this really has to offer,"Lets get this out of the way. That fine looking Cougar in the green dress and that brigade of bad boys makes for an awesome front cover, but heck that's all this show has to offer at this point. It really was ok when it started but it went from being dramedy (drama with comedic themes) to just a boring series. This this should be the last season or maybe they should end it next season. I give this 1.5 stars, I wish you could rate something on this site 2.50, 3.50 and so on."
5,Great,There is nothing really to say this is a great series that keeps you hanging. Andd for the price that i got it for im happy with the product there are great episodes and i cant wait for saesion 7.
3,not as impressed,WOW- This show is my husband and I favorite show. We were a little disappointed with this season. Getting a little far fetched.
3,"love the show, season 6 was so-so","Weeds has been a very entertaining, hilarious show so far. Was excited to watch season 6, but it was a bit of a letdown. A lot of fluff and space filler episodes. It surrounds around Nancy taking her family on the run and seemed more ridiculous than previous seasons."
5,dope head..,Never smoked or did weed but I love the culture and whole facet of society that it creates.Nancy is the best actress to come along in a long long time..
2,LOVE THE SHOW JUST DIDN'T LOVE THE QUALITY OF THE DVDS,"I PROBABLY WOULD OF ENJOYED THIS SEASON MORE IF THE DVD DIDN'T KEEP SKIPPING. IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING THAT I WAS WAITING AND WAITING TO GET THIS IM THE MAIL AND WHEN I FINALLY GET TO WATCH IT IT SKIPPED, I HAD TO KEEP TAKING IT OUT OF THE DVD PLAYER AND CLEANING THE DISC. NOT THAT IT DID ANY GOOD. I WOULD OF RETURNED IT BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GO THRU THE HASSLE. STILL A GREAT SHOW THOUGH. ALSO I WAS PRETTY PISSED THAT I ORDERED SEASON 6 AND 7 AT THE SAME TIME YET I GOT SEASON 7 FIRST AND RIGHT AWAY BUT IT TOOK LIKE 2 EXTRA WEEKS FOR SEASON 6! HELL NO I WASN'T GOING TO WATCH SEASON 7 BEFORE 6 THAT'S JUST DUMB!"
1,Buy at your own risk,the first dvd was bad had a big scratch and i got it new in the wrapper from MightySilve so watch out everyone
1,Disappointment,Got to the third disc of the season and it would not play at all. Entire product returned and awaiting refund or replacement.
2,Burning Out,"Possible spoiler:This had to be the worst season of the series and showcased just how horrible of a mother Nancy is.Up through the fist few episodes of season 5, the show enjoyed a pretty good run and was fun to watch; Celia made it even more so and when they got rid of her it was like the wind was knocked out of the show.Spoiler:In an interview with TV Guide, weeds creator Jenji Kohan apparently stated that season 7 may be the last and that Nancy may die. I didn't see the interview (it's posted on the Wikipedia page) so I don't know if it's true or not.But I do know that I was so board with season 6 that I didn't even watch the season finale until a couple weeks ago.Unless you're a collector I wouldn't waste my money on this set."
2,just okay,"The last episode of last season had such an amazing ending and this one opened to a nimble start. Attaching Andy to the drive in the plot was written in a very crude way, not so believable. The whole episode felt forced, not the usual sparks, great entertainment feel the other seasons had. It almost feels like they are running out of creative juice. I quickly scanned the blurbs for the other episodes and the storyline seems pretty lame. Is this the beginning of the end for this great show? :("
1,Never got it!,"Very hard to review a DVD--or service--when I paid my money to Amazon and never got the DVD.The only response that I got from the vendor was, ""Chill Out"". He said he sent it. I guess that;s where his responsibility ends.Never had a problem with Amazon before. First time for everythng, I guess."
4,DVD case looked like it had been ran over.,"The season played perfectly fine, but the case that house the DVDs had been crushed and does not close. It is really good for the price though."
5,"Snipp, Snapp, Snurr and the Red Shoes","55 years ago, when I was in first grade, I could hardly wait for the bookmobile to come every-other week, so that I could check out this book or others in the series. Snipp, Snapp, Snurr and Flicka, Ricka and Dicka had many wonderful adventures and the illustrations are beautiful. I was always happy after reading one of these books and thought of them often over the years when my children were growing up.How thrilled I was to see them back in print! The stories are simple, yet each one sends a message of value to a child.Grandparents, your little ones should have the joy of visiting with Snipp, Snapp, Snurr and Flicka, Ricka, and Dicka."
5,The Red Shoes,"How wonderful to be able to share with my grandchildren the Snipp, Snapp, Snurr series of books that I loved as a child. It was like stepping back in time."
4,Sufficient quality for occasional use,"I needed some larger metric hex head sockets to remove some plugs on ATVs and motorcycles. These aren't torqued parts, so my required duty cycle is pretty low. But for what I needed it for, they are perfect. Fit and finish are fine, commensurate with what I was expecting. Worked well in my applications to remove and replace plugs and other low-torque hex head bolts. Durability seems fine so far, although these are low-use tools.If you are a professional mechanic or expect to use these regularly and/or on high-torque applications, you may be disappointed as I doubt that the durability will be sufficient for your needs. Instead, go with a professional/warranted set, but expect to pay accordingly."
4,Allen sockets,Finally found what I needed. I looked everywhere for a 9 mm allen to work on my Mercury brakes. Good price too. Nice case. Thanks
1,Beautiful Wallet,"Not only does it not hold anything, but if you try to put a ""normal"" amount of cards into it, it then pulls away from the frame. I really had hoped this would be a wallet that I could use for years."
1,complete waste of space - doesn't hold anything!,"i was very excited about this wallet, and very sad when i had to return it. the leather on the exterior and the interior lining are beautiful...but once i put in my ID and ATM cards - which didn't even fill half of the available card slots - the wallet was too full to close! the wallet is larger than i would prefer, but i did not mind when i ordered it because it looks like it holds so much, but if you want to be able to close it, you seriously cannot put more than your ID and a few dollars in it. what a shame."
5,A challenging but wonderful read,"It took me a while to get used to the Scottish phrasing and accent, but this is definitely one of the most compelling novels I have read in a very long time. Sammy is an astonishing character: Full of good and evil, full of sympathy and loathing. He is a fascinating antihero, wish his story could have gone on forever. Pick up this book, be determined that you can get through the 'language,' and you will be rewarded with one of the most challenging, expressive, and engrossing tales you have ever read."
3,I was not impressed.,"When I finished the book, I didn't care to think about it any more. The story and writing was somewhat boring."
3,Very Difficult Read,"Well atleast this is one differnt book. It is totally unlike what you can expect of a Booker winner. I must say it is an extremely slow story, really not moving altogether. Moreover, written in Scottish slang it can be a tremendous task to comprehend. The story has no emotional buildup nor any character that you can remember. Page after page you hope for something to happen. But yet I always wanted to finish it. A strange book!"
1,Too Late for Me,"I ordered this to learn more about modern-day Scotland, and because it was a Booker awardee I expected something interesting. I'm disappointed on both counts. The first several pages are probably the most vulgar, obscene screed I've ever seen and that was enough for me. I put it down and won't return to it unless I exhaust the thousands of good, useful books available. Yes, available about Scotland, too. I don't like the cover either."
3,"A good, but not great, read","Having read all of Irvine Welsh's books, I was looking for some more Scottish writers whose books are in dialect. Luckily for me, I found this in the Salvation Army shop for a couple of dollars. Now, I'm originally from Glasgow, so it was interesting in that regard, but I'm pretty much in agreement with Tam's review (see below). The book was apparently controversial because it's profane, but it's nothing really. People talk like that, worse even. Irvine Welsh writes dialect better and more consistently, allowing you to distinguish between Edinburgh and Glasgow accents (which you'll only get if you're from there, by the way). As for the plot, it's OK, Sammy the main character has some good lines, but at times I was frustrated with him. But that's what it's all about, I suppose. Worth reading, but if you're not from there, then you won't get the most out of it."
3,nae bad ken,Ye open this book an yer thinking what's this no punctuation. It's nae bad but. There's no a lot of action but the voice is authentic enough though it shifts a lot between whit seems real and stuff that's definitely literary like. Ah suppose ye have to dae that kind of thing if ye want a booker tho.
2,I can't understand the language,"I think it isn't written in English. Maybe it's Scottish that I don't understand...if I had known about it, I wouldn't have bought it"
4,Excellent parenting & general knowlege about pre-teens,As the crisis counselor in a public high school and middle school I found this book to share great insights as to what works and what doesn't with this age group. It is presented in laymans terms and easily captures the readers interest. There is so little written information on pre-adolescents and the battles they face. I'd love to see a follow up on the kids the author profiled in about 10 years. Anyone that works with or has middle school age children must read this book.
5,Incredible,"Having been a fan of Freedy's after purchasing Blue Days, Black Nights and then his back catalogue, this record is another beautiful addition. More of a pop slant to this one and it challenges the best of Big Star. All the songs are well-written, there's not a clunker on here and the cover of ""Love Grows"" fits really well with the feel of the record. It's a sunny day record with the occasional song for a passing cloud."
2,Not too good...,"I love Freedy Johnston. But I am woefully disappointed by this CD. I loved ""This Perfect World,"" and also enjoyed ""Never Home"" very much. But this CD is simply not very good. It sounds like an artist who is trying to fulfill a record contract. There's nothing to get excited about unless you consider covering an old Edison Lighthouse song exciting. For first-time Freedy listeners, stay away! Buy something else. For long-time fans like me, I think we deserve much better than 38 minutes of filler!"
3,Sort of cheesy cute...huh....that's a cheesehead for you.,I bought it as a gift and it was well received. Don't have much to say either way.
5,A must have!,Very useful book for anyone wanting to make their own wireless sensors based on atmel avr and pic 18f micros.Good coverage of getting a prism based wireless cf card working with the included example code. Takes you through step by step so someone with a good understanding of c and microcontrollers can understand and see how it works.Also covers interfacing cf cards to avr and pics.Definately worth having a copy on your bookcase along with Fred's other book Networking and Internetworking with Microcontrollers.Very good book for senior students and hobbiests looking for a next project.Just ignore the last paragraph of marketing bs on the amazon page.
3,Misrepresented Description,"I purchased this book with the idea of using it as a reference for the DPAC wireless module, which I have evaluated and found to be an exceptional value. However, there is absolutely no mention of that device anywhere in this book! The description is completely misleading. I was thoroughly surprised by this inaccurate description. However, the contents of the book describe, in detail, another design for a wireless microcontroller which is very worthwhile. Specifically, the description of interfacing to a wireless compact flash card was a fine job of reverse engineering. So, useful to me after all, but very much by accident."
4,Great insight of POW maladies and a resourceful doctor,A short story showing the dedication of an American doctor's fight for the welfare of POWs. A wonderful human triumph over an evil and sadistic enemy. The cruel and uncaring Japanese were unable to destoy the spirit of these men held captive as conveyed by Dr. Shabart's book. Furthermore the survival of POWs under Dr. Shabart's care speaks about the graditude of patients from enlisted to general.
1,Suspicious,"I find it very suspicious that this book is so similar to Alfred Weinstein's ""Barbed Wire Surgeon""."
3,Deleuze from a english point of view,"This book is good. But, if you want something more complex, more historical, this is not the book you need. The quotes of other philosopher are zero. The confrontation with other works of Deleuze is nule.Anyway, in so far as this book is introductory for the reading of DR is a decent book.I spent this dollars, and I don't have any regrets about that."
4,Three Tenors in Paris -,"This is a nice concert with some beautiful songs. I especially love Pavarotti's ""Caruso"" which he sings better than any other person who attempted to sing this song. (Bocelli really botches it up badly.) Domingo and Pavarotti show some wear and tear since their 1994 concert, but they are still all terrific. Time moves on, and we shouldn't criticize such talent. Although, Pavarotti looks ridiculous in his black hair and painted eyebrows. He needs a makeover. Carreras seems to be in good health abd good form again and probably did the best in this concert. A must have for Three Tenor fans! I did enjoy watching this performance."
2,"Good sound, but the edition bothers me","The voices are OK, but there's no feeling like in the previous concerts, and i don't feel completely satistied after each viewing. The medleys are the best, and the production below the Eiffel Tower looks awesome.My problem after seeing this was the edition. The opening is so cold and unatractive, and everything goes so fast, that i lose the attention, altough the arias are interesting...Good concert, but looks unatractive."
4,sound awful,"Beautiful images of Paris. Beautiful program, but the sound is awful. Probably the tunel like stage in which the wind go through and the Champ de Mars to wide. Pavarotti does not seem at ease at all, for an hour. He is a sound fanatic as we know. His interpretation of Granada is a flop. Worth the buy?...Yes. You will have to ajust your sound system. Refer to CD edition for titles of the songs."
4,3 tenor dvd - Paris,"the tenor voices themselves are marvelous, as usual. However, I would have to rank it 3rd behind the original 1990 Rome concert (1st) and the 1994 Los Angeles (2nd) concert. Also - and I hate to say this - Levine is nowhere near as charismatic and entertaining as Mehta. Sorry."
5,Good quality and good service!,"I needed to replace several worn out aerators,and these fit the bill nicely. Good quality, fair price, performs flawlessly, and free shipping. What else could you ask for?"
1,Great product,This is a great product but there is something to mention about it. It is not electronic at all. It's a mechanical product.
5,Grown sons LOVED watchign this together...a classic!,"My sons watched this when it first came out, and when they were young boys still at home. We bought it for each of them this summer when we gathered for a family reunion. It was go great to see them, once again, enjoying this classic together!!"
5,Fly fishing and nature lovers ultimate movie,"This film is a tribute to nature and, according to the author Norman McLean's father God's sport ""fly fishing"". I agree. Magnificant Montana is the backdrop for a study of a family with many imperfections but a great appreciation for Mother Nature. I enjoy it more with each viewing. I've even learned to fly fish! Gives me a chance to hear my voice within. Thanks Mr.McLean."
3,Decent Adaptation of an Average Book,"This 1992 movie has a star-studded cast (Brad Pitt, Tom Skerritt) and is a great period piece based on Norman Maclean's autobiography of the same name. Great cinematography, with a meandering story line (to follow the river I'm sure). An overall ""nice"" film - not hard to watch, but not hard to skip either."
5,"would buy from them again, great doing business with them","just like i said good doing business with them, and to just let u know i liked the other form u had for review and rate this item"
5,Simply Majestic!!,One of the most beautiful films I've seen in my life. The natural scenery of Montana is sublime!
2,"Movie is Great, Box was not","I recently purchased 3 DVD's and rarely do so nowadays. I thought that there was very little risk in buying such a thing and did not think that the box would be sun bleached. Was not that happy about that, as it was a gift and I wanted the gift to have the full experience of the Special Addition features etc... Did not think that warehouse would have window displays where this could happen. :-("
5,A Keeper,"There are few movies that I'm willing to purchase, only those that I enjoy seeing again and again. This is without a doubt one of those films. Brad Pitt, Craig Sheffer, Tom Skeritt, Emily Lloyd et al, all gave fine performaces. Redford's narration of a great Norman Maclean novel and the scenic Montana views added immeasurably to my enjoyment of this film. This is one for folks of all ages!"
5,it's a great movie about two brothers .,I suggest everyone to see this movie because its a great movie about two brothers. I personaly learned alot from this movie and its a good movie for every age.
1,Disgusting - should be rated R,"How is this rated PG?! It has multiple scenes of full male and female nudity, pervasive profanity, excessive booze and smoking, multiple scenes of abject drunkenness, & complete moral degradation. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. It focuses on themes of corruption, reckless and extreme debt, gambling addictions, alcoholism, etc. etc. This move is disgusting, depressing, and vile. It should be rated R."
1,Tedious Waste of Time/Money,"I should have read the bad reviews before watching this over-long, misadventure in film-making. I have to agree with ALL the one-star reviews here. I am glad I saw this mess on TV before buying the DVD. It is highly offensive to anyone not saturated in liberalism with perverted views of religion and art. This crap is pointless, obtuse, and degrading to the kind of people who live in Montana, none of whom appear in this movie."
2,Leonard Maltin was very kind,"I just founfd the movie boring - beautiful scenery, but boring - all I can figure is it is a man's flick or if someone really liked Brad Pitt, who incidentally looks like young Redford so much that I found it a bit weird. The only part I really enjoyed was seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's young face again."
1,not true,the movie is fine but before i purchased it i read the description and it says that the movie has subtitles in spanish and the true is that IT DOESN'T!
1,TOTAL CRAP,"I cant believe that Ive only found one bad review of this film on the whole internet. Have you all gone mad? Apart from the beauty of Brad Pitt and the Montana scenery, this is one of the most disappointing badly made and boring films I have seen since ""Independance Day""! Deeply irritating, very bad continuity, (eg scenes where his clothes are all wet and the next minute totally dry) AWFUL mawkish script - particularly the narration - and Im sorry to all of those out there who like this self-indulgent and grossly over-rated film, but Im pretty pissed off Ive just wasted 2 hours of my day. I would have given it no stars if the form field had let me."
1,A Pile of Crap,"If there was somthing for NO stars, I would rate it that. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's beyond boring, there is no climax at all. The movie just drags on about some guy and his family. Hell, if this is such a great hit, maybe my dog can star in the sequel."
5,B R Bruce,"This is a beautiful movie. The cinematography, which features rural Montana, is beautiful; and the way in which the plot is portrayed is also beautiful. This film has touched my heart for years. The movie varies somewhat from the original novella written by Norman Maclean, but there are several memorable passages from the book incorporated into the script. Regardless, the movie is wonderful and the experience of enjoying it has been improved by having it issued on Blu Ray."
4,"A story, an art.","A movie that had no popular resonance but exemplified the beauty of water, trout, family, the sun, and the richness of life yet unexplored. We are a dying species, this film perhaps captures a few of us who perceive the transience of life and the beauty of seeing into the moment.The photography is a wonder, the theme is unique, the message is universal."
3,"Good, but not great.","I enjoyed the scenery of this movie, which has breathtaking views. The casting was pretty decent as well. The other reviewers are right in the sense that this move does provide a feeling of sentimental values at the ending, but I was quite disappointed with the movie. I couldn't really sense too much of a theme from the movie because the character analyses seemed to be too vague in order for you to completely understand their dynamic nature. The ending, for instance, shocked me. I didn't really see it coming, especially since there was hardly any time for the main characters to reflect upon the action that had taken place, and left me without a sense of closure. The beauty of this movie is very aesthetic, I guess, and for what it is I would say it is a good movie, but not a great one by any means."
4,slow but beautiful,"River Runs Through It is a pretty film that pays tribute to the joys of fly fishing and the beauty of Montanna. It is has a plot that is one of the slowest to unwind that I've ever seen but it's based on a short autobiography and it had to be stretched and padded for the movie.You have a soft hearted minister who has two sons. One is sensible and tells the story, the other one is ""wild"". Brad Pitt plays the wild brother, Norman. Norman is beautiful and charming and his family loves him and indulges him too much. He has a big time gambling problem and he hangs out with some bad people. You know how this is going to shake out. Norman might as well have Grim Reaper standing behind him in every scene and when he dies young and off screen you aren't surprised.Other than that not much happens."
2,"Too slow, too poorly directed.","I have tried on more than one occasion to like this movie. It is beautiful to look at of course and worth seeing it just for the scenery. But, Redford just missed the boat on directing it. It just doesn't hold the interest. The pace is so slow most of the time that you could doze off and there seem to be odd things thrown in for no particular reason. Brad Pitt was too young, with too little depth as an actor to put everything into the role that needed to be there. He just comes across as a rather delinquent personality with no real depth. Pretty much a tragedy looking for a place to happen from the time he was just a kid. I think the test of any movie is ""does it grab you and hold you from the first scene?"". This movie does not."
3,Overlong but enjoyable,"Superbly photography and an unbelievable score do (believe it or not) compensate for a predictable and overlong story. It's still fairly entertaining however and beautiful to look at, with all actors at the top of their form. Good family viewing. Just don't look for originality or much depth."
5,"Admittedly, not for everyone.","Some people will complain that it's pace is slow, while others will praise it's deliberateness. Some will say it's boring, while others will say it is restrained. All in all, I think your mood when you see it will most impact your opinion. That being said, I found the film to have an almost magical quality as it tells the story of a family trying to make their way in a changing world. If you demand quick edits, a high-concept plot, and cliched paper-thin drama, the movie certainly is not for you. If you can accept the pacing, this movie cuts deep."
3,"Nice to look at, but dull to watch","I insisted on revisiting this film after 15 years, and my opinion still has not changed:the film is beautiful to watch but is dull in it's telling.The plot goes little to nowhere,and the film seems intent on lulling us rather than informing us.These characters cannot be known by what Redford puts up on the screen;only by what we can infer.If the conclusion of this film is that we truly no no one entirely, then that conclusion has been accomplished here for a most unsatisfying look at a Montana family as remembered by the author."
2,Self important and boring,"No one can deny that this film is stunningly beautiful. The Montana scenery all captured by fine photography is wonderful. But, unfortuanately that's all the film has going for it. The acting is good and it's certaintly interesting to see Pitt, (looking alot like the young Redford), in his first major screen role but no one really makes much impression. Basically this is self important, one note movie about the susposed joys of family love brought together by the dullest of sports, fishing, with little plot, humour or suspense. The strikingly similar ""Legends of the Fall"" is much better."
5,Literature in motion,"This movie is my ""hands-down favorite"" of all time because of the moving dialogue (straight from Maclean's book) and passionate acting. From the beginning until the end including every moment in between, this movie will capture and impress you."
4,A wonderful moive!!,I really enjoyed this movie because it shows the strength of family and brotherly love. It truly touches a place in your heart.
5,Life lessons plus natural beauty,"I think anyone who ever contemplates life would enjoy this film but for me, being a flyfisher and lover of rivers, it really resonated someplace deep inside.The performances are outstanding all around, especially the job Brad Pitt does. He really makes you believe he could and would jump right into being Paul, his character.Of course it's not all fishing and scenery but a lot deeper than that. The irony and pain of the truth...that no matter how much you love your family members and no matter how hard you try to help them, sometimes they don't want the help but only want to feel the love that comes from it being offered.So no matter which angle you view this film, it is at once visually beautiful, thoughtfully poignant and multi-faceted. It has much relevance to our everyday lives and I guess for me that quality is what a great film should possess.Like the book, a classic..."
4,Gives clear direction on the cards,"it discusses. Some of the cards are not in the book. Also, some of the descriptions are very short and vague. Some of the descriptions are excellent though. I asked about the outcome of a lawsuit one time and the card I pulled specifically was described as saying you would be successful in a lawsuit."
5,My snake loves this thing!,"I bought this for my baby red-tailed boa, and she absolutely loves it! You'll almost never find her anywhere in her 6'x3'x20"" enclosure BUT coiled up on the branch somewhere. I put it near her radiant heat source. She won't let go of it either if I try to take her out of the enclosure LOL."
3,this is not your 60's Peter Fonda,"Peter Fonda here is more like his Dad than his famous Easy Rider 60's role.His character is a hard working bee keeper who, when his TV broke, never bought anther one.When the drug addict daughter -law comes homeyou see a marked change in this family in a few short weeks.I see this movie as Peter Fonda seeking redemptionfor his past mistakes.I liked the movie, but I think the truth is somewhere between the extremes of roles."
1,good movie but dont by from this seller,"this video played ok but the sound has some thing wrong with it i had the volume twice as high as normal and snd still could hardly hear it,i bought a trotline at the same time which is junk impossable to return because of course since i opened both"
5,Gregorian Meditation,Great CD. My wife and I listen to it almost daily. We even use it for prayer sessions. Also the product was in perfect condition and and was as advertised. We're totaly satified.
1,"Purchased as ""new"" but it's scratched","I purchased this CD ""new,"" as a gift. The person to whom I gave it, informed me months later that the CD was scratched and it skips repeatedly. How does Amazon manage to get away with selling used items as new?"
1,Metab Herbs,"In the past, we have loved Metab Herbs (capsules). I never dreamed this would be in a form other than capsules. It is like eating grass! We haven't been able to come up with any way of taking it that doesn't cause nausea. I thought about sending back the second bottle which was unopened, but I thought we might figure out how to get it into our system. My suggestion would be that the company should never attempt to sell this in ""grass"" form. Guess we are wimps......."
2,misleading,"The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less. Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can. Each can was different. The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price. The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder."
3,Only One Way... And It's Not Pretty,"Dunno where there were 100 ways, I found this as an ebook somewhere, and it was pretty much one way they mentioned. Change your name, and keep a low profile.Which is great, unless you're looking to keep your identity, but simply disappear from the public eye (like some film stars try). In which case, only the latter part is valid, and there's a bunch of advice in here that isn't valid.Also, by the end of the advice on how to disappear, you aren't really living free. You're living in fear, being very cautious of neighbors. A better book would be simply how to live (legally) off the grid, officially existing but no longer having any interest to the public."
4,A Gothic tale that rings dark and mysterious to the end.,"Mary Yellan is our spunky protagonist who has come to stay with her Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss, and evil man who is the landlord at Jamaica Inn. Early on she is warned of strange happenings at the Inn and after one look at the clientele she has learned to lock her door at night. Strange noises deep in the night alert her to the possibility of illegal activity but she remains silent at her aunt's request.Mary becomes friends with the Vicar, an albino who has taken a bit of a fancy to her, and Jem her uncle's brother who is a rover and a thief. What is there in Mary's future on the moors, so sinister and dreary? Who's groans and cries are heard on the wind, as it washes up from the ocean, and penetrates the fog that lies like a blanket upon the moors?A true Gothic adventure that will leave you feeling the depth of despair and the chill of the air as you wander the moors in search of the answers. Kelsana 6/4/02"
5,Jamaica Inn,Enjoyed the book immensely. Daphne DuMaurier's descriptions are supberbly detailed so one feels they are present in the area and amongst the characters.
5,An Exciting Classic,"First off, I rarely read fiction, much less romantic fluff. Don't let the New York Time's proclamation, ""A Fine Romantic Tale..."" scribbled on the book's front cover scare you off. There's little romance in this novel--only a trickling of emotional feelings surface periodically. Rather, the book offers suspense, superb writing skills/dialogue and rich location/time period imagery. A wonderful page-turner and fun read."
5,Great story--kept you glued to the pages.,"Very mysterious and scary, but over all great story. A sure read."
4,A good book,"A mysterious, thrilling , romantic novel. You can see one character's fear in his jumpy movement, hear another's anger in his dirty talk. You can also smell the moral decay of the Jamaica Inn.At first, the story is really scray.Although the story won't happen in our daily lives, it is so attractive that you can't put the book down at all."
4,Page Turner,"If you love to be transported to Victorian or post-Victorian England, you will enjoy this story of a woman suddenly on her own. I personally love the syntax, style of dialogue, discription of life, and the discription of the English countryside of this period."
3,Not as good as Rebecca,"Expecting a story similiar in style to Rebecca, I was disappointed. Although it was not what I expected, I was surprised I enjoyed it, even though the romance element was definitely hard to find. In various books the history of smuggling on the English coast has been mentioned and this story centers around these crimes explaining in much more detail. Therefore, it is an interesting history lesson."
3,"Starts out well, but drags on too much","I prefer Du Maurier's My Cousin Rachel and Rebecca to Jamaica Inn. If you enjoy her novels, you will probably enjoy it, however, it is not her best work. The book, while descriptive, becomes tedious about half way through. You almost want to choke the main character, Mary, for continuing to be so blindly loyal to a derelict uncle by marriage and his patheticly weak wife. Not a 90's book for your daughter!"
3,Jamaica Inn is NOT Rebecca,"Since I loved Rebecca and My Cousin Rachel, I thought I would give Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn a try. The writing is wonderful but the story not so much. I kept waiting for Mary Yellan to get her poor aunt out of Jamaica Inn and head for a better life somewhere else. However, this was not to be.The characters seemed to be almost caricatures for me and I figured out fairly quickly who the man was behind all the evil. I also could not relate to the ending since Mary Yellan talked about living a life like a man and farming on her own.This is not my favorite Du Maurier novel."
3,Time Changes All Things,"I first read Jamica Inn as an inexperienced teenager living on dreams and fantasies of finding true love and living happily ever after. I thought the story of Mary and Jem was a wonderful love story, over coming all obstacles, giving up all for true love, over coming evil, and setting off for a life of romance and adventure. Ten years later and no longer dreaming of love and happily everafter I reread this book. It depressed me. Mary, by going off with Jem, had condemened herself to the same life that had drained her aunt of hope and vitality. Drink and time would eventually turn Jem into the same abusive character his brother had been. When the kids started coming and there was no steady income, no secure shelter Mary would turn into a shrew.It really depressed me.The story was suspensful, and the author was a gifted writer. Just don't think too long on the future of the two lovers after the book ends."
2,"Overdone, over long for this fan","DuMaurier's best works rise above the formulaic romances that have become cliché. Not this one. The protagonist's inner conflict does not spring from the same insight that created ""The Scapegoat"" or ""My Cousin Rachel."" This poor girl of the moors is a bore. The most interesting character isn't in the book enough to compensate. Try another one instead."
2,Other Books,"Jamaica Inn by Daphne Du Maurier is an adventure an I suppose something of a Gothic romance, in that the adventure is about a woman who goes to live with very disturbing relatives, and a lot of nastiness goes in.There is, of course, a bloke around who is not a nogoodnik for the heroine to lean on."
1,"A ""romance,"" alright","I started to read Jamaica Inn in preparation for seeing the HItchcock film of it, so I could appreciate how much and how well or ill the adaptation of it was. I put the book down after about 140 pages. It has utterly no sense of period, just like the standard historical-romance novels of 2011. It's set some time shortly after the Napoleonic Wars concluded (1815), but might be happening in 1715, 1615, or even 1915, as long as the references to the nineteenth century were changed or expunged. Du Maurier's ear is strictly middle-of-the-road 1930s; she apparently couldn't even appreciate the Cornish accents among which she lived. The flatness of her diction makes the heavy sentiments that course through the book seem forced and artificial, and the characters seem hackneyed. If you're looking for richness of language and convincing realization of period and place, don't bother with Jamaica Inn."
5,This is an important tool for teachers.,As an educational writing consultant I recommend this book to all my K - 1 teachers. It's fabulous. Marcia Freeman is an educator who REALLY knows how to get emergent writers started.
3,For Craven fans only,"This is designed for big, big, big fans of Wes Craven. It is a slim book whose text seems to be primarily based on magazine articles and newspaper clips. The book gives a fairly good overview of Craven's history and philosophy in a readable and serviceable style."
5,Stunning CD collection of Germanic Western Soundtrack Music,"This set of 8 CDs is getting more and more expensive with time, and is among the few truly classic presentations of film music on CD. These sweeping, melodious scores are beautifully recorded and the set comes with a magnificent hardcover book, which, though in German text only, is mostly made up of lush color reproductions of each films advertising materials. It's a large LP SIZED package with 8 CDs in 4 double-disc jewel cases.While versions of these films have yet to be marketed in the USA on DVD, those familiar with these Karl May film adaptations know that the music is a major element, and deservedly so. This is a prized possession for film music collectors with deep pockets.The key composer is Martin Bottcher, with contributions by A.F. Lavagnino, Riz Ortolani, Peter Thomas, Erwin Halletz, Gottfried Huppertz, Raimund Rosenberger and Ulrich Sommerlatte. Released in 2001 by world-famous Bear Family Records."
1,Goosestepping From the Beginning,"Pat Buchanan's a skilled writer. There's no doubt about that. However, we shouldn't let his witty charm obscure that fact that he is a hate-filled protectionist who wants a lilly-white America.People who talk about ""culture wars"" and ""purifying"" America scare the bejabbers out of me."
1,Buchanan is right.,I have come to the conclusion that Buchanan is right.Very right.Ultra right!!GET IT (YUK! YUK! YUK!)?
1,"Belongs on the shelf next to ""Mein Kampf.""","Do you hate gays? Are you a religious zealot? Do you worship Ronald Reagan? Do you you lie awake at night, wishing Bill Clinton would die a horrible, painful death? Do you think Spiro Agnew ""got the shaft""? Are you racist? Sexist? A Fascist? Love the military but never took the time to actually join it? Then read ""Right From the Beginning,"" by the ""Thinking Man's David Duke,"" Pat Buchanan! It's a must read for all of America's ""Angry White Men""!"
5,"C'mon, now ...","Hey --- it's a Leviton AC receptacle. These folks installed lighting in the ark.I mean, unless you plug/unplug 200 times a day, it'll probably last 50 years."
4,;0),"This movie was SURPRISINGLY good I was not expecting that. After reading the preview of the movie I thought ok could be another cheesy D rated movie. But it kept me on edge, the thriller was there and you wanted to see how they were going to make it out of the swamps alive would surely recommend, after a while it's a movie I would watch again."
4,Black Water,This movie is filled with gore and suspense. There's lots of action and some scary scenes. I liked it a lot...good cast and the actiing was also very good!
5,amazingly amazing,"the cover looks trashy and very B movie like, plus i am not a big fan of horror movies that contain crocodiles,apes,snakes etc. the more i was happily surprised about black water. u can never really tell its low budget and it kept me on the edge of my sofa almost the entire time. u get sucked into the atmosphere...especially knowing this is based on true events makes it even more chilling."
5,VERY REALISTIC.,"YOU WILL BE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT THE ENTIRE MOVIE. NO FAKE OR RUBBER CROCODILES IN THIS MOVIE. THEY USED REAL LIVE CROCS. I HAD RECENTLY WATCHED THE MOVIES CROC AND ALLIGATOR. SO I WAS EXPECTING MORE STUPID ACTING AND MORE FAKE, RUBBER, ARTIFICIAL LOOKING CROCS AND GATORS. THIS WAS A SPLENDID SURPRISE. MY WIFE HAD A NIGHTMARE BECAUSE OF THE MOVIE. I JUMPED IN MY CHAIR A FEW TIMES. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES THIS REALISTIC. IT IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS JAWS."
2,Good but not very original,"I saw this movie and it was okay but it borrowed many elements from another movie (besides Open Water, which I haven't seen). Another killer croc movie, also Australian, called Rogue has a lot of similarities with this film. Rogue was made first (although released later at least in the U.S.) and had a significant higher budget than this film. Other than that Black Water is okay, only not original."
3,Decent thriller!,"As others have said, there are similarities toOpen Water (Widescreen Edition)(which I really liked). The use of little known actors and real crocs adds to the sense of documentary in this ""based on actual events"" movie.Be aware that the movie is slow out of the gate, but picks up plenty of steam by the mid-way point. And like Open Water, much of the suspense is built on what you don't see, more than what you do."
3,a good first book,"I loved Goodman's Kaaterskill Falls, which I thought was truly magical. I was not as pleased with this book. I felt that the stories were disjointed and the characters not particularly well-developed. I was hard pressed to hear the beautiful voice Goodman fashioned for herself in her later works."
4,Cuban Music at Its Best,"Esther Borja's singing style is warm and calid. With a bit more training than Zoraida Marrero, she can still remind us of the Cuban nights of yore. The collection comprises a number of traditional different musical styles, most of which are performed by Ms. Borja. The instrumental style is excellent. My only complaint is of the sheet enclosed with the CD. It neither lists the records in proper order nor credits them accurately (or credits the orchestra properly). However, since this is a matter of a piece of paper and Ms. Borja's singing is a matter of beauty, I strongly recommend the recording."
2,Need a bigger ear I guess...,"I got this because it matched my phone and the price was right. WELL... the earpiece doesn't come close to fitting properly. I was looking for a nice snug fit that wouldn't fall off at just a shake of my head, and this ain't it! Don't really like the volume control either. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it came in a package that included a matching case with a wrist strap (designed for a Razor but fits my LG Muziq just fine) and a little screen cleaner that works nicely, so not a TOTAL loss I guess, but still irritating and disappointing. I got a Plantronics that fits and sounds great, so my pretty pink matching H500 will reside in the back of the kitchen junk drawer. Live and learn ;)"
2,TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTING.,"LG IS A WONDERFUL AUTHOR AND I HAVE ENJOYED MANY OF HER BOOKS. I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THIS ONE SINCE IT WAS SO HIGHLY RATED AND WAS NOTED TO BE THE ""BEST"" OF THE BRIDE SERIES. WELL INTO THE BOOK I WAS STILL WAITING FOR IT TO GET GOOD. THE FIRST 300+ PAGES ARE JUST SO MUCH BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. JEFF'S FEELING SORRY FOR HIMSELF AND BEING MISERABLE TO EVERYONE GOT PRETTY TEDIOUS. FINALLY ABOUT PAGE 360 IT STARTED TO PICK UP AND IT WAS ENJOYABLE FROM THERE TO THE END (PAGE 460).....CERTAINLY NOT A PAGE TURNER OR KEEPER."
5,The best,I have read all the Seven Bride books when they were first released. I continue to this day go back and reread them. Violet was my favorite of them all. I fell in love with Jeff from the begining. I could not wait for him to find his true love and I am so happy that he fell for a Yankee. It did serve him right. Jeff and Violet were both injured souls who really needed each other. They fought their attraction but knew it was hopeless. You have to read this book even if you haven't read the others. It explains so much of emotional suffering and the happiness that can be discovered when you are not looking for it. I wish the Ms. Greenwood would contiue with the Randolphs with the next generation. It would be interesting to see what happens to the twins and the other children of these men.
5,"This is a ""Gotta have"" !","I have read all of the ""Seven Brides"" and all are great...But Violet has been my favorite. It made me laugh (having Jeff up in the attic of the girls school because he was to impatient to read the quartine signs is worth the price of the book), made me want to cry because Jeff was so emotionally screwed up from his fathers abuse and the war. I just loved how Violet could just slip in past all of Jeffs defences and find a nice snug place in his heart against his will...:) If you haven't read the ""Seven Brides"" do so in order and this story will be all the better."
4,Another from Beaton,"This is another winner from M.C. Beaton, but not as good as many of her other works. Unlike nearly all of her other works, this is not subtable for a very young audience as it deels with issues of sex and sexuality. The maturer reader will, I'm sure, find this book as delightful as the rest."
3,The stories just get better.,"This entry in the series keeps up the good work and offers a surprise for those who have followed the series so far. (I hope you're reading them in order!) Here Agatha gets to ""play house"" with James as they go undercover to solve yet another murder in the Cotswolds. Lots of good stuff happens with the ancillary characters, too."
3,"Read Agatha Raisin, but dont start with this book","I love Agatha Raisin. M.C. Beaton has created one of the finest character studies of small provincial towns I have come across. I've found myself laughing aloud several times with each book that I pick up and I bless Beaton for that.In her previous three stories, the mysteries have stood second stage to Raisin's interactions with people in the town. And that was just fine. But here it seems that Beaton is attempting to turn Raisin into a bumbling Mrs. Marple alluded to in every story. But it doesn't work. Beaton just can't set up a mystery on par with Christy and in her efforts to do so, Beaton sacrifices much of what was so enduring about her first three Raisin stories.I did not especially like this book though I plan on reading more Raisin novels in the hopes that Beaton once again captures the magic of her past triumphs."
2,"Just Sweats, Not Genuine Army PT Gear","As long as you don't need real Army PT gear, these are fine. My son joined the Army in Jan 2007 and was issued a set of PT gear for basic training that he described as grey sweats with the black lettering ""ARMY"" on the chest and pant leg. He had lost his set in the laundry. I ordered these, but he couldn't use them. He said they couldn't pass for the real thing."
5,I use the Neoair PLUS in my living room. I'm a happy customer,I purchased the Neoair PLUS air purifier for my living room and I'm pleased with the fine results.
3,I liked it until it quite working,"We have two Neo Air Plus units. Probably about 3 years old. One of them will no longer work. Very difficult to find help or info. Seems that the motor needs lubrication, as the blower wheel trys to turn, but only can move VERY slowly."
3,Not her best--but...,...maybe worth tracking down if you love her music.Production is poor. Its muddy--a real disappointment.Tracy sings a GREAT version of Going Back to Tennessee.I rate this cut in her top 10 performances.
3,so-so,"It keeps falling off my baby's neck, which is a hassle once I start driving to pull over and fix. You have to make sure you tuck it in firmly into the child's neck to stay. Looks a little scary because you worry about the baby being able to breathe through it if their neck slumps down and his/her face is lying into the pillow."
2,Stuff sticks like crazy,"Sure, it's a solid piece of cookware, but it's a pain to keep clean .. stuff sticks to it like crazy.. and since it's not a 'traditional' cast iron pan (it has a coating on the inside), it doesn't seem to take to seasoning like a normal cast iron pan would. I definitely do not recommend this product unless you enjoy spending 30 minutes scrubbing it every time you use it."
5,Perfect for pan-broiled steak!,I love this skillet. Recently rediscovered the joy of pan broiled steak and the skillet performs perfectly. Nice and heavy - not for the weak.
2,"good for cooking, but cleanup is too difficult","I got one of these for Christmas, and while I like cooking with it, it's too much of a hassle to clean. .. not worth the effort. I cooked some chicken breasts in it a few nights ago, and the drippings that went in between the ribs will NOT come off. they are charred black, and I've tried scraping, scrubbing, boiling water in it, using the ""Le Creuset enamel cleaner"", all to no avail. Why this pan does not have a non-stick surface is beyond me. I've been soaking and scrubbing this stupid thing for 3 days now, and it's still got black residue at the bottom. And yes, I was cooking on medium heat. Do NOT waste your money on this pan."
3,Promises more than it delivered,"This pan works well when you first put the meat on it. It leaves lovely grill marks, however, after the meat starts cooking for a while, let's say after you turn it over, the grill marks start to lessen. When you get to the next batch of meat, the grill marks get less and less prominent and the pan starts to get bits stuck to it.I like to use it only if I'm cooking for 1 to 2 people. If I'm cooking for more, I tend to not use this grill pan because of the way heat is retained. I don't know whether it's my stove or not, but when I use a cast iron skillet, I still get seared marks on my meat, so I'm guessing it's not my stove."
1,"As always, Chinese flatter Whites and Whites are pro-Chinese as long as Chinese live outside of where Whites live.","It is so amusing how long Chinese and pro-Chinese Whites praise Iris Chan's fabricated photos and testimonies. Before you exclaimed ""Revisionist"", you should examine all of photos and evidences presented by Iris Chan and the other Chinese on the ground of credibility and debated with Japanese and Chinese survivors, not government officials.There are a few things you need to know.1.) There weren't more than 300,000 Chinese in Nanking then.2.) Nationalist Army and the majority of civilians had already been evacuated before the Japanese Army entered the city.3,) While GEN Matsui was pro-Chinese, who defended Chinese POWs, GEN Keninnomiya, deputy CO and emperor's royal family, advocated the massacre for the sake of Showa Emperior. The man who advocated the massacre should be punished including to the Emperior."
2,"Works, but not very well....","It charges my Treo 700w faster than the wall charger or my iGO universal adapter, but still has the following glaring problems:1) Squeals loudly when in a charging state2) Interferes with AM radio reception while charging3) The connector quickly developed a problem with intermittent contact to the phone. Unless the phone is sitting at the right angle, contact is not made properly, and no charging occurs. this is annoying since the phone tends to bounce around a little in my truck, and I have to insert the phone upside down into my cup holder to maintain just the right angle with the charging cord.All in all, I wish I'd spent more money on a better quality charger. The build quality of this unit seems good, but the performance is poor."
4,It works.,What do you say? A charger either works or it doesn't. This one does. It would be nice if the cord was straight instead of coiled as the coils try to pull the connector out of the phone if you have them stretched.
3,Very Disapointed!,"Don't get me wrong, when it comes to cooking with them they are awesome, everything cooks nice and even.But when it comes to wear and tear, the outside of the pan, they just scratch way too easily and for the price I just expected better than that."
2,Spend this money on stainless instead!,"We've had this set for three years now, and the outsides of the pan scratch up and stain when oil spills on them very easily and the silver metal parts on the inside that hold the handles on are impossible to really clean, and it seems now that some of the pans are losing their non-stickability! Thess may be the best non stick pans on the market, but after talking to a few kitchen experts, all non stick pans eventually lose their non-stickability, so buy inexpensive non stick and spend your big bucks on the stainless stuff. Wish we had."
4,Melody in abundance,"When you need an hour of relaxation, this is one CD you should reach for. Enjoyable melodies, fluid guitar work and fine harmony vocals all intertwine to provide an aural pleasure."
1,Hobbytron is the worst company I 've dealt with.,"I warn all consumers to stay away from any product sold by Hobbytron. We've had a nightmare experience with them. We received a defective remote control vehicle from them and there is no way to return it. They will not answer phone calls or emails. Once you purchase the toy from Hobbytron, you better hope it arrives in perfect condition because if it doesn't, you've wasted your money. You will NEVER be able to get in touch with them and they refuse to address any problems with their products."
1,False Advertized,"This program is advertized to run on Mac 10.2 or newer but if you have a newer mac running OS X Lion it will not work, dont even try. If you buy it, your likely to recieve my copy as i am absolutely sending it back totally pissed off!"
1,Slow and mostly required,"I purchased this program for a nutrition class. I was excited about logging my nutrition and tracking my progress. This program ran incredibly slowly on my computer. It seemd like the database it was hooked to was either too small or too old. Its interface was good for tracking, but terrible for tracking and setting goals to lose weight. I was unclear about whether I needed to use keep the cd in my comp the whole time or not, each time I put it back in it tried to re-install the program.Synopsis - Decent for a class. Wouldn't recommend it for anything other than that. I sold it as soon as I could (before the class was over)."
4,very soothing and interesting music,"I have heard a track or two on spinner.com from this CD, so I decided to give it a go - very good album.I like the way these guys arrange the strings and flute together. This is an album to read or work on the computer to - dont' try to clean house or pull weeds, wrong stuff.I like this album, and try to play it when I have company over. It sets a very good mood for intelligent conversation."
1,Wrong Movie!!,"This movie is misleading: The cover image and star list, as well as the plot synopsis suggest that this is Deewaar(1975). However, the film is Deewar(2004) which is described in the editorial review. The DVD case is likewise confusing, with the incorrect cover image, but correct summary on the back. Both star Amitabh Bachchan. Confusing! Make sure you are buying the film that you intended to!!(as a side note, I have not watched this film (2004 version) yet, so I don't know how it rates!)"
5,Emotional movie,I love this movie. Everytime I watch this movie I love it. My kid love it too. They have become a big Amitabh fan after watching this movie.
2,"Great Movie, but...","I loved the movie when I first saw it at the theater back in 1990. When I purchased this movie I was expecting to see the whole movie on ONE disc. With the technology available to transfer a movie longer than 181 min. on a singe side (dual layered) one would think that this movie would be given the same treatment. NOT! It is a 2 disc set with 17 chapters on disc one and 8 chapters on disc 2. Bummer. I loved the DTS sound. But I am very dissapointed in the way the company released this DVD.Buyer Beware! I thought I was getting a good deal, but when one has to get up and switch out the disc in mid movie you loose interest."
3,"Well, It IS Hollywood, After All","Not a bad film, but sure does leverage stereotypes of Native Americans that may not be true. Odds of a whit guy being assimilated and revered in a Native community seem pretty far-fetched. Great cinematography, though."
4,The extended version really adds a lot,"When Lieutenant John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) steals a cavalry horse named Cisco (played by Plain Justin Bar), he unleashes a chain of events that leads to an accidental victory for the Union troops, and Dunbar becomes a bona fide Civil War hero. Given the outpost of his choosing as well as the Buckskin horse, Dunbar makes friends with a shy wolf called Two Socks (played by Buck and Teddy), and hooks up with a Lakota Sioux tribe where he meets an enigmatic woman named Stands With Fist (Mary McDonnell).The extended version DVD really adds a lot to the viewing experience -- be sure and listen to Costner's commentary, as it's not only informative but it's funny and is full of good anecdotes.Staci Layne Wilson"
4,Special Edition: Great movie... but the picture quality?,"First of all, I agree with all other reviewers here that the added scenes only serve to increase the quality of this epic film. The included documentary is also something special for those who truly love this movie. However, since I own both the original DVD release and the new Special Edition, I have noticed one minor flaw. The color in many of the scenes on the Special Edition DVD appear washed out or faded when compared to the original. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Badlands scene. The colors on the original DVD were bright and vivid, while those on the Special Edition were relatively dull and pale. While this fault is not enough to keep me from recommending the purchase of this DVD, it does raise an interesting question. Shouldn't the Special Edition be of higher overall quality than the original, and not vice versa?"
5,Still Good After 20 Years.,I watched Dances with Wolves the other night. I was surprised that this movie held up as well as it did. The scenery in 1080p along with the Digital DTS 7.1 was outstanding.
5,Dances with Wolves,"Excellent movie.Great acting by all the stars.A very well written story and produce.The scenery was something else.You won,t go wrong with this one."
3,Bad transmission!,"Absolutely love the movie, but Amazon streaming stinks! We purchased the HD version, but the constant buffering and lousy resolution totally ruined it."
2,Best Picture: I think not.,"Where do I begin? I was only able to watch this movie in incriments of about 35 minutes each. The first 35-40 minutes of it were good. I really enjoyed learning about Lt. John J. Dunbar, and the Lakota Sioux. After the beginning it flies down hill. They make Union Soldiers, American Citizens, and Whites all together look like nothing more than evil killers, and they make the Sioux look like wise, all- knowing, super- humans. Neither of these descriptions fit neither of the races.Basically, this is good if your so naive to think that Dunbar and the Sioux wouldn't have opened fire on eachother the first chance they got.P.S.- In the year of ""MISERY"" (Rob Reiner) they chose this?"
4,good service hope we can do bussiness again,thank you very good product and got product in a timely manner hope we could do bussiness again thank you
3,give me a choice,"dances with wolves is a classic.i donnt have the blueray version of it but was looking forward to the release of the directors cut, not the theatrical version.buy one now and than buy the one i want later.pure marketing b.s. i will wait i guess.i hope other buyers do the same.this is really getting redundant.is it my imagination or is amazon raising their prices on bluerays,28.00 for machete,good flick but not that good.have to check out target i guess."
4,Worth while,Dances with Wolves is a great filM. Kevin Costner does a fabulous job portraying a soldier. I recommend watching it
4,Dances with Wolves,I know this is a very PC movie but I love the sweeping camera shots and Costner's vision (maybe not the real deal) of the West. The extended version does clear up some of the blanks that did not make ot to the theater such as what happened to the previous occupants of the fort he moved to.
5,"""dances"" brings the western roaring back to life and about time","keven costner's oscar winning masterpiece is just what the western needed to help bring it back to life. sadly there are still not enough westerns being made today.this,now,nearly 4 hour epic of the life of lt.john dunbar and he travels out west is one of the most moving and beautiful films of the last few years.slow at times,but never dull this is one great movie and belongs in your collection even if you don't like westerns."
1,How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...,"Actually -- let's skip the counting and get to the heart of the matter...I despise this movie most of all for the way it tries to forcibly yank out emotions using simplistic, cardboard-cutout characters (the BAD cavalrymen, the GOOD indians, etc...you get the drift). By the end I felt sullied by the brazen manipulation, and I was PISSED OFF.A director with a deft touch might have pulled it off. But not Kevin -- no, he had to use an effin' sledgehammer!Loved Costner in Bull Durham. Hated this flick.Bah!"
1,Not laptop compatible,"Love this movie... Words can't describe it but my recently purchased DVD won't play on my new Gateway laptop. Something about some incompatible file???? This information should be made available to the buying public, by both distributor and the PC maker. Perhaps our technology isn't as great as some would have us think."
1,Deadly Dull,"Several years ago, I saw a ""Far Side"" cartoon depicting three people standing around a punchbowl in an otherwise empty room, with the caption, ""The 'Didn't Like Dances With Wolves'"" Club. Well, I would have been the fourth. A visually stunning picture, ""Dances with Wolves"" is one of the most mind-numbingly dull films ever made, due largely to the complete lack of enthusiasm and screen presence of its star and director, Kevin Costner. Costner was terrific in ""Silverado,"" but has been unrelentingly personality-less in subsequent films, and was absolutely the world's worst Robin Hood. At any rate, ""Dances with Wolves"" may be a feast for the eyes, but it sure is little else."
1,Need the full director's cut for the Blu-ray transfer,"Talking about Dances with Wolves on Blu-ray! It has got to be the extended Director's cut, nothing less. Not the theatrical version. Got DVD for that. Production company - please take note."
3,Not the same as product pictured,"The bluray was not the same as pictured. Or someone forgot to include the outer artwork sleeve with the Bluray. Some of us like the outer sleeve artwork. Other than that, the movie played fine even though the disc was loose in the case & bouncing around for two days. Not Amazons fault, but the manufactures fault for using such cheap a$$ cases."
4,extended version,"Personaly, I thought the movie was the best Costner has done yet, he needs to direct more like it. The reason I didn't give it a 5 rating is they need to bring out the extended version of Dances With Wolves, because it gives more detail of some of the things that happened and gives a better explanation of some of the events that happened in the movie."
3,DANCES WITH WOLVES GOOD MOVIE BAD DVD,"I still love the DTS version which was release in 2 dics by IMAGE . This new version with 1 hour extended scenes split the movie in 2 discs was a major let down by it picture quality . The picture are too soft & lack any detail compare with the DTS version which was sharp with more detail resolution . The BIT RATE was much higher on the DTS version .Great movie with great first time DIRECTOR , KEVIN COSTNER .He deserve THE BEST DIRECTOR FOR DANCES WITH WOLVES .I think we also deserve the best DVD ENCODING for DANCES WITH WOLVES . BEST MOVIE , BEST DVD ."
5,The long cut holds up.,"I read the book and saw both the released cut and this longer version. I expected to see new scenes and there were a few, but the main difference was that the story moved at a little easier pace. Sometimes a longer cut doesn't hold up because the new information isn't needed for anything, and sometimes a longer cut is indispensible for the parallel reason. In this case neither seemed to apply, but I liked it. If I was to choose, I'd choose the extended cut version."
5,Kevin Costner romances Mary McDonnell in a Indian epic,"In this Indian film by Kevin Costner. Costner Director and actor stars as Civil war Soldier LT. John Dunbar, who abandons his American Army post to see the frontier. After wounded in war. Dunbar is discovered by a tribe of peaceful indians, who Accept him into his tribe. As they name him ""Dances with Wolves"". He learns how to communicate with them and finds himself romancing their Translator Stands with a fist, whose a American woman raised by them. But he finds himself caught between A Army conflict and friendship with the Indians."
5,looking for special expanded edition,"I'm looking forward to buy the 3'57"" edition from amazon. Please do'nt make me wait too long! sincerely your customer"
1,Stronger than a sedative.,"Dances with Wolves starring and directed by Kevin Costner is such a boring and long war film. The art direction and acting is pretty good but the story goes nowhere and I just can't get into this over-ambitious drama. Stick with Gone with the Wind if you want an entertaining, gorgeous epic."
1,gives you that cozy feeling!,"Delightful yarn about an American soldier who betrays his country by providing firearms and military assistance to the enemy, then assists in the massacre of several of his fellow soldiers when they attempt to bring him to justice.Great for the whole family!"
1,Extended Cut ruins the Movie,"I am sad that there is no 181 minute theatrical version for Blu Ray. I always love extended cuts of great epic movies, but this is one case where I do not. Many scenes are totally unnecessary. Sometimes less is more. I will sacrifice watching the standard smeary DVD so I have the theatrical version."
3,. . . Extended . . . yeah . . .,"Dances With Wolves is a good movie, a very good movie in fact. But . . . it's longer. Wasn't three hours long enough? Now it's four hours long. Seriously, I do not want to sit through a four hour movie when I could watch the same movie in three, especially when the extended version really doesn't help the movie in any way. It's just longer."
1,Barnsey,"This was my first purchase of a Blur Ray movie from Amazon. I am unable to play them in Australia as they are dedicated to Zone 1, which means it will only play in the Americas. There is NO NOTIFICATION that such product has this LIMITATION and therefore is sold without this disclosure. I cannot return it as the packaging has been opened. Some attention to correct this would be wise."
5,Blu-ray Region A Locked ?,"I would like to buy this special edition blu-ray as well, as Dances With Wolves remains today my all-time favorite movie, 20 years after I first saw it, back in 1991 ..I live in Switzerland, where the Region Code for blu-ray is B.If this blu-ray is locked for Region A I won't be able to watch it on my player.I checked the website of www.blu-ray.com, and the Region A is confirmed, while Region B and C remain untested.If anyone has more information about this matter, I'll appreciate the help !"
3,Doesn't have original release,"Got this as a gift for my movie-buff husband, and he loves it. However, he was disappointed that it doesn't also include the original release so that he can choose which version to watch. If you're looking for the complete package, look at other products that will have both versions."
4,Great film about past American Indian life,"All the scenes when John Dunbar was in Indian country with the Indians makes this film so great. The film is mostly very peaceful but not boring, even though the film is almost 3 hours. The acting, costumes and scenery were fantastic. The film portrays John Dunbar's Indian friends in a very positive light. There is also a neighboring tribe that is more violent and warlike, whom they must battle.The only drawback I found to the movie were the scenes with the American Army. These scenes seem essential to the story, but the peaceful scenes with the Sioux are what make this movie. Luckily, the scenes out in the wilderness and in the Indian village dominate the movie. This movie is very long, but worth watching."
5,The best epic about the American West,"Wow, this is a powerful movie. I recently rewatched it after several years and suddenly remembered what really makes a great movie. I love how ""Dances with Wolves"" begins with an intimate portrait of the American West, from the vast plains to the charismatic wolf ""Two-Socks"". The film follows Kevin Costner's emotional but nuanced journey from disillusioned Army officer to Sioux patriot. The acting is superb all around. There are no shallow characters, even within the U.S. Army. Every character seems to have several layers of emotional complexity. ""Dances with Wolves"" is an emotional and visional treat. I can't wait until it comes out on blu-ray."
5,Dances with Wolves,My father lives in an assisted living situation and loves this movie. He watches it over and over. Thank you for getting it to him so quickly and in great shape.
5,A true Hollywood EPIC!,"Howdy;I'm not going to review the movie itself except to say it is one of the best I've seen. Others have done a wonderful job of review.What I want to say is this Extended Cut might be long (236 min.), but it takes you in and seems no time and it is over. I have seen both versions and found this one fills in all the blanks.With Enhanced WIDESCREEN, 5.1 Surround Sound and a hi-def TV who needs to go to the theater?If you like this movie, you might check out ""Open Range"", another great Costner film.L8R Daze"
5,My 2nd favorite movie of all time!,"I have had the VHS for years, but just got the DVD extended version the other day. Now, I understand a few more things in this fabulous movie because of those scenes that were cut out.This movie is a masterpiece. I can't say enough good things about it. It has it all...a great love story, history, magnificent scenery and is so engaging, you almost wish it was longer than 4 hours! It's timeless! I fell in love with this movie the moment I saw it 15 years ago. It would be fantastic if this could be re-released for the big screen once again as it is truly breathtaking to see in a theater."
5,Epic Classic,"This is one of Kevin Costners finest Movies.. a must see! Characters are authentic, one of the most unbiased Films Ive seen..."
5,It is an incredible film,"I have rarely seen such a moving and beautiful movie as Dances with Wolves. The stunning thing is that it was directed by Kevin Costner, who did a brilliant job as actor as well. Everything about this film is first rate. I know some will say that it makes the white man all evil but I thought it was a nice mix of different people, at their best and at their worst. I would also add that this is a long movie, but it puts you right there on the prairie and some of the moments are almost excruciatingly beautiful. This a film not to be missed."
4,A celebration of Plains Indian life,"I have to tip my hat to Costner, this was a fine film. It is a celebration of the Plains Indian way of life. What I like is that Costner made it a personal story. He wasn't trying to be anyone, and he let the Native Americans shine in this epic revisionist Western. Graham Greene was superb, as were most of the native cast. I got the sense that Costner took a new spin on ""The Searchers,"" in which John Wayne played a disenchanted Confederate soldier who found himself out west. But, whereas ""The Searchers"" was much more cynical, Costner's film is pure romanticism. The story was ""real"" enough to draw you into the characters, which is all you can expect from a feature-length film."
1,BEWARE,Attention!!! Do not buy this edition!! It is mutilated. It is 181 minutes long. Buy the 20th Anniversary 2 Disc Extended Cut Blu-ray edition. It is 234 minutes long and I guarantee you won't be bored.
5,Fantastic movie,"This is a great movie. It has amazing cinematography,great special F/X and promising plot line. And if anyone gives it a negative review just because of the content (like that one Kid's review above me) They have no idea what they're talking about! I watched it with my class and we found nothing wrong with it! So be it! This movie is Costner's best!"
1,"Politically correct, Hollywood myth-making","This is not a movie as much as it is another mythmaking piece of Hollywood propaganda. First, there is no record in history of a US soldier ""changing sides"" and fighting for the Indians. Second, the movie romanticizes the Indians and their way of life, instead of portraying them accurately. Many years from now, movie historians will regard movies like this as the Amos and Andy version of life with the Indians. Finally, Kevin Costner is just not a very good actor. He seems to stumble through this movie without a clue..."
2,Blu-ray is Extended Cut Only,"The Reason for the cutting room floor is displayed in this, the bloated 236-minute Extended Cut on Blu-ray. One can see right away why these scenes were deleted in the first place, as they drag badly and do nothing to advance the story. There is no reason in the age of Seamless Branching, why these additional scenes could not be made selectable by the viewer, save for the obvious $$$$ grab by the studios setting up the inevitable double-dip on Blu-ray."
4,A Classic.,"Dunno why so many Kevin Costner films have to start out with gratutitous gore. But this is one of them. Skip ahead, the rest of the movie is wonderful. Filmed in and around Pine Ridge South Dakota."
4,A good tool for learning the Lakota language,"I am a teacher of Lakota language. While this film is flawed in its accuracy of Lakota culture in many ways, which is why I deducted a star from the rating, and while to the trained ear the Lakota is not spoken well because none of the principle cast was a Lakota speaker, this film..especially the long version..remains one of my best teaching tools for my students. I give Costner a great deal of credit for insisting on using the actual Lakota language rather than having the film all in English as he was pressured to do by Hollywood. Lakota, like many Native languages, is in danger of extinction if more young Lakotas don't take the initiative to learn their language, and this film put that language in the ears of the world. I can nit-pick on the cultural inaccuracies in DWW, but I'd rather concentrate on the fact that this film presented this beautiful language to the world and for that, I am grateful. Wowahwa na wopila. (Peace, and thanks). Cait"
5,The Extended Cut is 236 minutes of pure enjoyment,"After watching the theatrical version many times on VHS I decided to buy the Extended Cut DVD after we upgraded our home theater to high def. I avoided the Blu-Ray import version due to complaints I read about the transfer. The DVD on a Blu-Ray player with DVD enhancing technology looked amazing.The Extended Cut fills in so many gaps and questions that existed in the theatrical release. The empty fort, Stands with Fists' husband, the white-man slaughtered bison, and many more story lines are easily explained in the Extended Cut. I often have mixed feelings about movie additions, especially when only five or ten minutes are added. That's not the case with the Extended Cut's extensive additions; they make a great movie even better."
5,Blu-ray Upgrade Well Worth It!,"Seeing DANCES WITH WOLVES on Blu-ray recreated the experience I had seeing it first run in the theatre. This is a film that endures in every department. Not having the time to watch the film the day I received it I put the Blu-ray disc on just to check it out. I set it up with the second commentary track in which the director of photography and the editor recall their experiences. I was so fascinated with their comments and seeing the Blu-ray edition of the film that I ended up watching all four hours. This is a film that I would rank as one of the great classics of all time. As you listen to those who worked on the film tell of their experiences it soon becomes clear that this was landmark film for most everyone involved. For many it remains their favorite film to have worked on. The Extras match the quality of the film. They are worth looking at as they, like the film itself, are inspiring."
5,My favorite movie,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I love it much I have watched it more than a dozen times over the years.
2,Dances with Wolves - DVD,"Although this DVD arrived in good condition, and is one of my favorite movies, I would have preferred the widescreen edition instead. The full screen edition leaves out too much perspective."
3,DVD OPTIONS - DTS IS OUT THERE ...,The Region 1 /2 SE versions are just a tad disappointing .Check out the Japanese/German editions if you can - 4 discs with both theatrical & extended versions in DTS & with full commentary . In english so don't worry there ! Only trouble is getting hold of them when you live where I do - England !So why shortchange us Brits & you guys in the US with a second rate production .
4,"Special Edition. WARNING: ""flip disc""","One of my all time favorite movies. It's nice to see an extended 3hrs 56 minute version(55 minutes of new footage) and to see all the behind the scenes footage, documentaries, etc. Definitely a must buy. Five stars for the movie itself and minus one star for making us, the dvd viewer, ""flip"" the disc during the movie...wasn't that done with years ago? guess not. It should have been a 3 disc set like MGM's recent re-release of ""Windtalkers."" Nobody likes ""flip disc""! Stop it, movie companies!"
2,"Beware: This is not the ideal ""Dances With Wolves""","There's a reason why material is left on the cutting-room floor, and this DVD demonstrates why. The whole extra hour (!) of footage is interesting to watch, but fatally detracts from the pacing and power of a film that was already three hours long. Now, if this two-DVD set included the option of watching the original theatrical version, then I would enthusiastically endorse it. But it doesn't, and those new to the film will spend four hours only to afterwards scratch their heads and wonder how ""Dances With Wolves"" received seven academy awards in the first place."
4,"Great camera work, great locations","This is one of my favorite ""outdoor"" movies. Graham Greene is excellent (as usual). I wish they would release the special edition on DVD. The special edition has all the scenes included that you have to just guess at in this standard release. Worth buying!"
3,Extended Edition Only,"Expected the standard version but this only contains the 4 hour extended version. Very long, even if the film and score are very good."
4,"Excellent, but a bit pricy",Great shipping and a great product at an OK price (was a bit pricy). Would have been 5/5 if the price was less than ten dollars.
5,Pure magic,"What can you say about DWW that wouldn't be a rehash of cliche's that have been told over and over. It, to me, is the best movie about the great Sioux people ever made. The extended version is worth every minute. It fills in some gaps and ties it all together. The cast is superb, the dialogue intelligent and the acting is near flawless."
5,Indians have never been portrayed so affectionately,"Many films have tried, but nothing like ""Dances With Wolves"" has succeeded in capturing the truth about the Native Americans and their culture.Kevin Costner might not be popular for that flop ""Postman"" but this is a film to commend him on. He created a portrait of heroism for the Sioux Indians, and showed the much feared vision of Native Americans: The Pawnee. It gives the audience a real look of the time and the people.Great acting from actors and actresses. Great directing. A truly great film."
3,Why not available?,"I had hoped to give my husband this DVD for Christmas, this year, only to find out it is very hard to find, out of print and those that are left over are ridiculously priced! Why, oh why, is this 13 yr. old movie not available at the average DVD price and not in print at the present time? I cannot give it anything higher than 3 stars, because I have not had the chance to see it on DVD, and do not know quality or content. I have seen it in theatres and on TV, and absolutely love it. Please make this available again, at a normal DVD price! Thanks!"
2,"dances with wolves, special addition","I received the wrong one. the one i wanted was the one on this page, showing. it is in the diary cover (like the diary he kept in the movie. i had it at one time, but has been miss-placed. so i wasnt to happy with it. i sent a mesaage to Lilly books, and they said it could of been amazons fault posting the wrong dvd cover"
1,Inserted cuts ruin film,"This review pertains only to the DVD special edition, which is a case study in how not to release an extended cut. The new cut of the film adds about an hour of footage, most of which are repetitive, ruin the continuity, have production problems, or disrupt the pacing. For example, pointless scenes of the original Sedgwick soldiers are included. Furthermore, there is no way to view the original theatrical cut of the film. There is no reason that the new scenes could not have been included separately in a ""deleted scenes"" section, or an option included to watch the original cut of the film.Avoid the ""special edition""."
4,Great film and transfer but no slip cover,If you're buying this recently there is a good chance you won't be getting the slip cover with it. All signs point to anyone selling this that they no longer are giving the slip cover with it. It makes sense from a business stand point but for a fan its pretty disappointing.
3,Dances with Wolves DVD from Canada,This product is fine except it only plays on certain DVD players due to (as advised in small print on the very bottom of the back cover) only being meant for distribution in Canada or the USA. I am in Australia.
4,Good Movie,"Good Movie. Missed It In Theaters, But Caught It On VHS. (Not A Costner Fan) But This Was Actually A Good Movie"
2,Muddling Marsh,"Not one of Marsh's best to my way of thinking. Excepting perhaps Detective Alleyn, the book is full of characters that one does not care about, engaged in an uninteresting sequence of events. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is unclear as to which character has what significance. Also there is not much of a sense of atmosphere. Disappointing."
5,Dame Ngaio's best,"This is perhaps Ngaio Marsh's best example of an upper-crust English murder mystery. The characters are so finely drawn that it makes you wish they would show up in her other novels. Rory Alleyn is at his youthful best, with a convincing amount of restrained-British angst just to make him more loveable. This is a compelling whodunit, with more than enough great writing and humour along the way to make it look great as a novel, too."
2,CD version narrated by B. Cumberbatch is ABRIDGED,"This is one of my favorite Marsh mysteries and I was delighted to find a CD audiobook version. Unfortunately, I was extremely surprised when I wound up with a 3-hour abridged version that is a sorry condensation of one of Marsh's longer books. The product description doesn't mention the number of CDs or total playing time, or I would have realized my mistake. (The word ""Abridged"" is basically illegible in the fuzzy product photo.) I DO NOT recommend this version -- read the book itself, or buy the complete, unabridged version on iTunes."
3,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed the music, it has a nice, somewhat poppy sound to it that makes you like the song initially...unfortuntly the enjoyment doesn't last, its poppiness just gets old. So the song is fine to listen to now and then, but you won't want to listen to it for more than a day really!"
4,LG Extended life battery,I just received the battery about 1 month ageo. Good so far. batteries life over time will be reduced but I'm happy with the out of the box performance thus far.
4,"Great battery, rather bulky.","I wasn't aware of what an extended battery was when I initially purchased this item, but I love the battery. The battery can last for several days with one or two conversations on the phone. The only downside is the fact that it is physically larger than the original battery and sticks out of the battery pack. Otherwise, this is a great purchase."
5,Saffy's Angel is A Fab Read!!,Hillary McKay has a way with using words to describe her clever and lovable characters that just suck you in and make you wish they where real. I loved the soft side of Rose revealed in the scene when the siblings are driving to Wales to find Saffy's angel. Her cute little notes to other drivers made me laugh out loud at their cleverness and left me with a new impression of her personality. Caddy's determinedness and sweet heart make her an effective character as the story develops. While Indigo's vulnerability and sincerity make you just want to reach out and hug him. Then there's Saffron the moody odd one out in the group. While Saffy's story unfolds I love how McKay keeps the stories of all the others going on quietly in the background in which Caddy's driving lessons with Michael take center stage. You will be led through an amazing heart warming adventure by the most loveable engaging cast I have ever seen.
5,This is a great book about an adventure,"This book is really great. All of the kids are funny in the book and Micheal, the driving instructor is also funny. There are 3 different countries that they go to in this book. I'd recommend this book for other 6 year old kids (and older)"
5,British Comedy: if you like Wodehouse . . .,"I checked the audio tapes out from the library on a whim. What a find. What a crack-up. When I started listening I kept laughing, but thought something must be wrong with me--isn't this a serious book? Nope. The car ride to Wales at the end was really funny. The lady who does the narrating is terrific. Maybe the book is for children, but adults should enjoy it too--if they are British comedy fans. The plot is pretty simple, so I'd say its main attraction is the humor."
4,Surprisingly good,"A friend brought the audio version along on a trip to DC. I didn't expect to enjoy it, since it's been some time since I've purposely read a children's book, and yet really did. The Casson Family is as interesting and charming, as they are chaotic. Somehow, they feel more like a family than one would expect, and readily accept friends (true friends that is) into their close-knit group.I'd have like to see more of Saffy with her family instead of this newfound friend, Sarah, because I felt as if the story was really about family, but it all worked. I suppose Saffy needed something that belonged to *her* as opposed to the family, and with Sarah, she found that. In the end, Sarah became a part of the family, accepted for who she is and her place in Saffy's life, and the rest of the Casson children accepted her as another sister. While she's Saffy's friend first and foremost, she's also very protective of the rest of the Casson's."
4,Loveable and Inspiring,"Saffy's Angel is the tragic but inspiring tale of a young girl, left alone in one world, and entering into the next.Saffy is a young girl, living in the strange, ecsentric Casson family of artists. But when she discovers she was adopted into the family, because her real parents are dead, everything changes for her.A very, very sweet read."
5,"endearingly eccentric family, a marvelous plot","Funny, touching and unique in its rich use of language and its fine character development. A truly enjoyable read about a family who love each other and really like each other. Delightful!"
1,More right-wing propaganda,"He says the conservatives give more, but they're very picky as to who they think is deserving. How very Christian of them. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
1,Poorly Documented-Clearly Biased,"This book is completely lacking in valid research. Simply put, if you love Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh, you'll love this book for its praise of conservatism and bashing of the left. If you are seeking factual information regarding giving in America, this is not the place to find it."
2,Not convinced...,"The Author negates most of his premise by starting off saying that Danes are the happiest people on earth. Denmark is very socialist, has incredibly high taxes, and is also very secular. Only 5% of Danes regularly attend Church compared to 43% of Americans.The author's conclusion based on his statistical analysis is that religion and conservatism are the means to a happier nation.It seems like he cherry picks his data to support his conclusion. His analysis is often speculative and surprise surprise, his speculation always supports conservatism and religiosity.It's an interesting read non the less, which is why I gave it two stars. If you are conservative, you'll love how he backs up your beliefs. If you're liberal, you'll leave unconvinced and questioning his methodology."
3,Some interesting ideas along with spin,"This is a worthwhile book that did a lot to break the stereotyped image of tightwad conservatives. However, some of the statistical support is a bit thin, and it seems to be overwhelmed by the conservative and religious viewpoints of the author."
3,"Religion, Not Conservativism, is Determinative","Of course the data can be read as the author does. But if you control for other influences, it appears that religion, not politics is what is most important in generosity. Compare religious conservatives with religious liberals and not much difference is found. Compare nonreligious conservatives with nonreligious conservatives and it turns out that nonreligious conservatives comprise the stingiest of all groups. Remove the political agenda and take a second look at the data and it doesn't look quite the same."
5,The better book you can get about OO,There's no way someone can get to know about objects without reading meyer's book. It's huge but worth
2,"Classical book, but obsoleted.","The author is famous in OO and the book is recommended from another book,however, the programming language used in the book is no longer used in the market."
2,"Bertrand Meyer's view on all things ""object oriented""","A good book, perhaps, for those who want to learn Eiffel (or, as the author simply calls it, ""the notation"") and why it is the only language that truly supports object oriented software development.This book is certainly not a comprehensive overview of the subject nor a fair or accurate depiction of non-Eiffel languages and techniques.I found Mr. Meyer's style both grandiose and pedantic. The book could also use some editing by a native English speaker.But hey, you get a free demo version of Eiffel on the CD."
1,A case of the Emperor's New Clothes?,"Everyone seems to be tripping over one another to praise OO and how this book is being presented as the shining gem of this field. But I couldn't get past the first few pages as I CAN'T figure out what the whole point of the subject is! I can appreciate the power of objects (say in a language like Python or Java) but Eiffel (and this book) takes it way too far from programming realities. Maybe this book and Eiffel will be much more suitable for those who are designing REALLY large systems (i doubt it though since if it sucks at small things then more so far large right?) where all the dense OO concepts might be more applicable but as for me, I'm willing to unload this book to whoever wants to buy it from me for half the price."
5,One of the best...,"This is one of the few books that really push beyond the bounds of ordinary books on software. A lot of those are just trying to explain you some well-known concepts, whether it is OO, a programming language or an IDE. This book also tries to explain te concepts of OO and programming, but it starts from ground up and explains every little thing while designing an OO-language. And if he happens to come up with a language called Eiffel (a language he designed) then it must mean that Eiffel is a pretty good language, because it is hard (if not impossible) to refute his explanation.This book really is on of the best together with Design Patterns and Effective C++. And either this book or Eiffel, the Language should be your introduction to OO-programming."
5,Excellent - Meyer is a great teacher,"If you've been developping in C/Cobol... and you want to understand what's the big deal about OO, then this is the book. The subjects are introduced wisely, and the chapters are clear. Moreover, it is fascinating to read. This is the closest to a thriller a computer book might get."
4,Haenchen's a 5-Star Conductor With A 3-Star Recording,"Even after listening to Karajan, Bernstein, and Barbirolli, I still find Haenchen's conducting of Mahler's 6th to be truly insightful and more than an artistic match for the over-priced major label versions. Haenchen knows how to mine the poetry from this symphony of death with a 1st mvmt that isn't off to the races like so many others; a 2nd mvmt which doesn't lose it's pulse; a fragile 3rd mvnt taken at a slower-than-usual pace, yielding even greater pathos; and a 4th mvmt of roaring drama. This a performance of controlled passion and persuasive intellect. Unfortunately, the DDD recording is not first-class (it's at a distance, a bit unfocussed, and has a limited high-end), but it is a serviceable document, more than good enough to grasp Haenchen's stunning vision of Mahler. At this price, there's no reason not to snap it up. (By the way Haenchen's Laserlight CD of Bruckner's 4th is also a world-class performance.)"
5,Wow,"I'm not an afficianado of Mahler 6th, but I do love the Mahler that I know well (1, 2, 5, and to some extent, 4, 7, 10). This recording, however, made me fall in love with 6 immediately. There's a lot that is diabolic, sweeping, and overwhelming, although I'm not so sure about how well-recorded the hammer blows are. The playing of the Netherlands Phil is first rate, and they are recorded in the Concertgebouw. While not the clearest digital recording I've ever heard, it avoids a lot of the DDD pitfalls, and some details, especially in the finale, are very well brought out. At the price, you surely can't get much better performance, or for that matter, at any price. All this leads me to conclude that Haenchen is an unsung excellent conductor. I've now heard a lot of his Haydn and some of his Mozart (w/ CPE Bach CO on Berlin), his Strauss and now his Mahler, and have never been less than greatly impressed. Maybe LaserLight will do the right thing and record just about everything the man conducts!"
5,"Excellent,factual & detailed narrative of RAF bombing","I read this on the advice of a friend after a tour of northern Germany during which I wondered why so many of the beautiful churches had been levelled in WWII. This book gives a detailed narrative of the strategy and tactics, as well as the horror on the ground and in the air of this controversial air campaign. Interesting and thought-provoking to read. Written by an Englishman."
5,Max Hastings,Although this book is 31 years old the information is as valid today as it was then. It exposes many of the myths surrounding the British efforts in World War Two. Should be of interest to those who wish to learn the unvarnished truths about this war.
4,Max Hastings WW2 books,It gave a different slant on the air war than I had ever seen before and I read a lot of WW2 material. I intend to read all of Max Hastings WW2 books.
4,quality,"The movie I bought was good, but there was one small point in which it tried to skip, thus why I'm only giving this a 4 star rather than a 5 star."
5,Powerful and emotional!,"After a period of changes of persons and styles, Soft Machine gets to the high point of energetic Jazz Rock, mixing performance with taste and emotion that we had never seen in this style. Ratledge, Jenkins, Babyngton and Marshall talk together with no words, but with a synchronicity that would take Karl Jung to review his thesis to better. While Mahavishnu Orchestra was paying dues to produce hundreds of poor notes, Soft Machine was training our brain to development in music. I am sorry that this strong group no longer exists."
3,"Not too good, not too bad","Seven number titles in and it is undeniable: the once trailblazing jam fusion monsters have become light parodies of themselves. There is still a focus on heavy instrumental interplay, though the heart and soul guiding these once inspiring sessions has been replaced by something entirely more predictable. It might be judged harsher then it should because of what came before; Seven is no worse then plenty of second-tier progressive music coming out then, it just does not have that true spark the band, in its proper configuration, was known to carry."
3,"Excelent exercises, bad quality of the dvd","I love the exercises, but the quality of the DVD is really bad, you see exercises of the right leg (16 repetitions) but only (6 repetitions) of the left leg , this uneven way to show the exercises occurs two or three time during each session . I bought three DVDs for a total of nine workouts and the same situation is repeated again and again, is very annoying."
2,Disappointed,I had been exercising with Gilad for long time may be 15 years. I know and liked his style a lot. But I am dissappointed that he cut his work out in this DVD. This work out is not complete. It does not include all the motions he normally does in his routines. It is very short and incomplete. I wish I did not bought this DVD. I bought his DVD s because they closed FIT TV. We can not watch him from TV any more. Bad luck!Sorry Gilad.
2,not that good,used it twice then it sat on my shelf for a long time before making into a donation bag.......
1,Doesn't look like St Francis,"This movie is okay but the old movie, although very dated looking, is still much better (Starring Bradford Dillman, Dolores Hart, Stuart Whitman). One day someone will use an actor that acutually looks like the portrait of St. Francis.The italian movie named ST. Anthony is good, if you want something more accurate of the times."
2,A really bad film about a really good guy,"I recently went to Assisi Italy where St. Francis was born. I wanted to see this movie to understand more about the life of St. Francis. The movie was poorly filmed, and choppy. Mickey Rourke and Helen Bonham Carter acted well but I don't think the director was very experienced. There were whole parts of St. Francis' life missing so I didn't even get the big picture."
2,Did they read the biography?,"This movie didn't remind me of St Francis at all. They depict him as reclusive, sad, tormented, etc. If you know the life of St Francis, don't watch this movie because it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth."
4,The best film adaptation to date.,"Although this film has obvious historical flaws and interesting casting (i.e., Rourke as Francis) it is the best film adaptation of Francis' life to date. It is a massive improvement of the ""Flower Child"" era Brother Sun Sister Moon. Offering a Francis a bit more graspable and human. In general this film is perfect for Francis enthusiasts."
2,Wrong Actor for the Role,"Mickey Rourke as St. Francis Of Assisi? I don't think so. This is one of the strangest pairings of actor and role, and while this may sometimes produce an unexpected surprise, this film is not one. There are many words that can be used to describe Rourke, but spiritual is not one of them, and it shows in this film - mumbling one's lines does not equate to piety. The movie plods along at almost two hours, and, in addition to being overlong, there is no sense of how much time has lapsed from one scene to the next, which destroys the film's cohesion and can, at times, be quite confusing. Good intentions do not necessarily make for a good film, and Francesco proves that."
3,Amazon Running Time is Wrong,Those expecting to receive the complete 157 minute version of this film will be disappointed. Running time is 119 minutes. Almost 37 minutes have been cut. If you are seeking the complete Cavani film THIS IS NOT IT: the advertised running time is wrong. What a disappointment!
4,Do not pay attention to previous review.,"Do not pay attention to the previous review. Although it does not especifically says, I am sure it is the film by Liliana Cavani, one of the best Italian film directors ever. There is a new DVD version available here."
4,Rourke is Good?!,"I thought this would be terrible, with the infamous Rourke as St. Francis. I was pleasantly surprised. Although this becomes a little disjointed toward the conclusion, I found this careful film intimate and fascinating. The male nudity probably will drive kids and prudes from the room, but even saints had to change clothes once in a while."
3,Interesting,This was very interesting for the first half of the book; however it does get boring as time goes on. For a very serious historian this book is something close to essenial but for the average reader it may not be as expected.
3,Informative but hard to read,"This book describes the probable lives of few types of people who lived in France, Venice and England in the Middle Ages. The author sometimes inserted words or phrases in other languages, without translation, and she inserted many sentences and paragraphs of the old English style, which were difficult to interpret mainly due to spelling differences. The book is interesting historically but not very easy to read."
3,still looking for recipe Italian bakery spritz cookies,The Italian sugar cookies are neutral tasting and more shortbread in texture than crisp. I wouldn't want to make these again.
5,A unifying conception of evolution,"The ""basic restlessness"", germ of anxiety, is according to Paul Diel, the common characteristic feature to all living beings, for it is determined by their dependence on an external world which may oppose obstacles against the satisfaction of vital needs. This book shows us with a catching precision in which way does, at the human stage, take place the reversal of anguish, nonetheless the driving force for evolution, into pathological anguish with all its individual and social consequences. But moreover, it shows the way in which pathological anguish can be overcome, and dynamically reverted into joy."
4,Two remixes not included but alot of rare remixes never released on a cd,"I loved the fact they added rare remixes of the songs like Hold Me In Your Arms, Giving Up On Love,She Wants To Dance With Me & Take Me To Your Heart but they should of added Ain't Too Proud To Beg remix and Take Me To Your Heart (Discothek Remix) unless space consuming on a disc is the reason why those mixes were excluded.I was kind of looking more forward to listen to this CD for which contains alot more rare remixes than Whenever You Need Somebody."
3,2nd astley album,"hold me in your arms has its good and its weak sides.some selfpenned tracks are good some s/a/w tracks not so good i think.it really sounds as if the pwl factory rushed rick into some songs like take me to your heart(cheap synth sound)and till thenn(not suitable for rick)i dont wanna loose her is not so bad but the highlights of this album are hold me in your arms""very soulfull ballad"" and aint too proud too beg""great soulclassic""she wants to dance with me has a better production than the saw tracks,i dont want to be your lover is great 80's r&b;!!dail my number is weak(the production is too corny)so in all the first album was a better album this one has its ups and downs but great vocals on every track thou!nico"
3,Can't quite replicate the brilliance of his debut,"This second album by Rick Astley sports some slick, strong S-A-W production, but whatever the ""secret ingredient"" was that they slipped into his debut formula has grown a bit stale this time around. In some ways, it's sonically similar to his debut, but it kind of gets lost somewhere between the feel-good dance vibes of his debut and the more adult-contemporary oriented albums he made in the 90s. He had a hit here with ""She Wants To Dance With Me,"" and the tracks ""Till Then (Time Stands Still)"" and ""Dial My Number"" are decent if not spectacular offerings, but ""I Don't Want To Lose Her,"" sounds like a mismash of ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" and ""Together Forever"" that really doesn't replicate the greatness of either one, and his cover of The Temptations ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg,"" while not outright awful, still won't make anybody forget the Tempts version."
3,"""Whenever You Need Somebody,"" Part II","'Saw the Brit a couple of days ago on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade; thus, I decided to ""revisit"" the two albums of his in collection: this one and his debut album, mentioned in the title.""Hold Me in Your Arms"" retreads the same format as Astley's debut: driving rhythms, soulful instrumentations, and the singer's great baritone. Though not quite as strong as his first, the songs are still representative of the era and provide a nostalgic trip back to the 80's, the last decade of pretty good pop music.The surprising cut is Astley's cover of The Temptations' ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg."" It gives an idea of what the singer could do with an all-covers album, so popular now with the the likes of Michael McDonald and Barry Manilow doing the same."
3,I like half of this album,"""She wants to dance with me"" written by Rick and ""I don't wanna lose her"" are great songs. I also like the two other SAW songs (""Take me to your heart"" & ""Till then""). Other songs written by Rick are quite poor."
3,Solution to the noop problem with Intermatic timers,"I got the dreaded Intermatic noop problem -- you try to turn teh lights on or off, the unit appears to ""try"" to switch (flashing display), then gives up and says ""noOP,"" which is computerese for ""no operation"" -- in other words, it failed, and it is teling you so.Most people end up throwing it out. I resset the unt, and scheduled an automatic (timed) on/off cycle. he clock switched the lights off at the appointed minute, and worked normally thereafter.So, if you get a noop, pull teh abttery, reset the unit, set the clock to 12:01 AM, then program an off cycle for 12:02 AM (if you were stuck with the lights on -- schedule an on cycle for 12:02 if they were stuck turned off). Put the unit in Auto mode, wait a minute, and when the switch changes successfully you should be back in business."
1,Reliability terrible,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me three (!) times, shame on me. Terrible quality. Units simply fail (the dreaded ""No Op"" sign - those of you who have seen this know that means you get to rip the thing out of the wall again) in less than a year. This last one, my third, lasted three months. The heck with the one year warranty. I do not want another one in my house. This has to be the worst product I have ever purchased and I have never written a review like this. Do not buy this timer."
1,Piece of Junk. Don't waste your money !!!!,"After a few months, I got 'No Op' message and couldn't even manually turn on/off my outdoor lights. This is my 2nd timer. Both died for the same reason and both didn't even last a year. The company Intermatic is continuously selling this product for years now and is still a piece of JUNK!!! Don't waste your money on this product. I wouldn't waste money for ANY of their products since they don't seem to care to fix it or stop selling such crap."
1,Can't believe they're still selling this,"Mine was reading ""NoOp"" within a week but still appearing to work, then read low battery (with the included new battery installed), then after replacing battery, read ""NoOp"" again, and No Op-ing too.At what point do you pull a product that fails on most buyers?"
1,intermatic crapapolooza,"Like everyone else who wrote the review my unit broke. First one lasted 6 months, returned and got a new one. Second one broke after 4 months. Is it me...obviously not with all these other fine people having the same issue.There is an earlier review where someone has a fix. I tried it and it works, however, no individual should have to go that extra mile to circumvent a clear defect.Cheers"
1,"Great idea, but junk product","It worked for a while then quit. It was great when it worked but it didn't last long at all. I tried several units, all of them failing."
1,Intermatic should be ashamed!,Same as others. I bought and replaced 3 units. All failed within 6 months. STAY AWAY.
1,Same problem as everyone else.,"I got lucky with my first unit - it lasted almost a year. When it failed to work and only gave the No Op display, I figured it was a voltage spike or something and replaced it.The second unit lasted about 3 weeks. I returned it to the store I bought it from and tried a third unit. That one lasted about a month.I've since replaced it with a motion sensor switch, which has worked perfectly for over two years."
1,Lousy,"I have had 5 of these timers, all have failed. One lasted less than a year, the longest life was under 5 years."
1,3 months then dead,"like so many others i loved this product at first. then, after 3 months the display flashes ""noop"" or ""inop"" or something and you can't even use it as a manual switch. my porch light has been on for 2 weeks. checking the manual it basically says that if your screen says 'noop' your switch is dead. calls to the company? forget it. nice idea, even nicely implemented - build quality is a disaster. check out epinions.com for even more stories of ""noop"" or ""inop""! avoid this product."
1,"""NO OP"" on FOUR SEPARATE UNITS!",I feel like an idiot that I didn't check online until just now! All this time I thought I had some sort of electrical wiring problem or severe voltage spikes or lightning strikes or something that kept killing these units! I have gone through four of these pieces of garbage and was headed out to buy more before seeing these reviews! WOW!My first two units lasted all of 7-8 months. The next two lasted 7-8 WEEKS. AVOID this unit.I'm going to try to call the company to see if I can get them to replace this model with the newer one as mentioned below in a separate review. I'm also going to investigate both the Swylite LST100 and Leviton 1122W as recommended in another review.Thanks to everyone who posted reviews to alert us to this known problem.
1,Works for 2 months of light use then breaks,"This product looks great but be prepared to see ""inop"" on the display after a few months, at which time you wont be able to turn it on and off manually even. You can't contact the company electronically, they want you to send them snail mail or wait on hold during business hours on a toll phone number. Not recommended."
1,"Thanks, reviewers!","Same problem as others. Have had two units. Got the ""No op"" after about a year. Emailed Intermatic Customer Service. No response.HOWEVER, thanks to the reviews posted here, I was able to salvage my unit by beating the side of it. Tried a hammer first (per Archie) which didn't work, then tried a knife handle (per Robert) and it started working again!Hopefully this will give me enough time to figure out a better replacement."
1,A Disappointing Product,"I'm sure that many will think this is the device they're looking for; it was created for a very specific need. However, mine went completely dead ""no0p"" within approximately three months. I had it installed by a professional, licensed electrician, so I know it was installed properly.Intermatic timers, a name renowned for automatic electric timers needs to go back to the drawing board on this one's design. Of special concern to me is that many folks purchase this item to enhance the security of their home, and with this product's miserable track record on reliability, it could be putting people's home and property at risk.Intermatic seems to be willing to replace this item free of charge, however, I would recommend purchasing another brand of digital timer altogether until this model's problems are resolved."
1,No op...no buy,"I've owned 3 of these timers in the past 3 years. 1st one worked for over a year & then I moved (no idea if it still works). The next 2 worked for just over a year & both died within a week of each other (display reads ""No op, see manual""). I emailed customer support at www.intermatic.com & they were happy to send me a new timer. Only, the timer that they sent died with 2 days of installation. So, they went ahead & sent me 2 new timers for an updated model (EJ500). So far, they both have worked & have had them for about 2 months now. I'm assuming that this happens often because I didn't even have to ask for a new timer, they just said they were sending a new one."
1,Great Idea Unreliably Executed,"These timers are a terrific idea but, as others have pointed out, seem to be notoriously unreliable. I have had two of them display the dreaded ""no op"" which no amount of resetting and battery changing has cured. One reviewer has criticized the device for working on a battery rather than line power. I believe this was done because most light switch boxes don't have the second (white) wire needed for a 120 volt connection but have only the black ""switch leg"". This makes the timer easy to install--just replace the regular switch. Too bad Intermatic is damaging their reputation with this dog of a device."
1,Thought was the greatest thing since the light switch,"I was sold and the first one I bought was great. Lasted several months. The thing is not cheap, $25 on ebay and $30 at Home Depot, but I had to get 2 more for around the house. Now all 3 craped out with ""noop"". Stay away."
2,"Great idea, poor quality","This is the ideal timer for outdoor lights, but unfortunately every one I have bought dies within a few months (NOOP on the LCD display)."
1,junk times 2,"Hey, Intermatic... get a clue, will ya?I've had the same ""noOp"" results with this timer after a short period of time as the other folks here. I installed one on our outdoor light switch and it worked great. For 6-7 months. Then, 'noOp."" No amount of pushing the reset switch, battery changes, unconnecting and reconnecting would bring the timer back to life. So I called Intermatic and the person I spoke with told me that ""noOp"" is their word for dead but that the product is quite reliable so mine must have been defective. There was no offer to replace the unit and I had no proof of purchase.So I checked at all the local electrical supply stores and Home Depots for a switch timer made by another company, but the only ones sold in my area were-- you guessed it-- Intermatic. I then (foolishly) purchased another, installed it, it worked as well as the first one for six months and this one just died.Ya got me twice, Intermatic. There will not be a third noOp."
1,Piece of junk,"Another vote for the No Op problem. I tried the fix recommended by a previous reviewer, to no avail. This is the 2nd one that broke. Definitely not worth the value of the plastic it's made of."
3,Intermatic Has Replacement For This Item & SS8C,"Intermatic released a replacement for this switch and the similar SS8C.The replacement has similar features - CFL capable, auto time adjusting, etc... but is all digital, so it should avoid the dreaded NO OP message, and also does not protrude from the wall as much.Intermatic White Self Adjusting Wall Switch Timer #ST01CI placed this review here because Intermatic will replace your SS7C or SS8C with this if you are still under warranty. They sent me mine without hassle and sent it quickly.If you are out of warranty, it still can't hurt to call them and ask."
2,"I Fixed My ""No Op"" timer","Mine was dead for several months. I tried beating it with a knife handle and it came to life today. After all, what did I have to loose? I'm sure, however, it will die again. Next time I'm gonna try waterboarding."
1,This switch is junk.,"I installed two of these switches and both stopped working within 8 months, this seems to be a common complaint in these reviews. I just changed over to the Aube 7-Day switch. I already have one of these in my house that a lighting guy installed when I got a bunch of fixtures installed and have had no problems with it. Also, the Aube mounts flush and has a cover for the buttons so it's much less intrusive looking than the Intermatic."
1,Crap,This product is crap. First one was replaced by hardware store within two weeks of installation. Now its NoOp after 4 months. Dont waster your time on this product....very unreliable.
1,No OP never Again,I bought 6 of these timers last year at a local hardware store for my outside lighting and three went bad after just a few months so I replaced them and they went bad again. I thought it was my wiring but after reading the other reviews I now know. Shame on Intermatic -- An American company putting out inferior work -- they should take the high road and lead the way by producing the best timer in the world at a great price.
1,"""NO OP!""","First one lasted almost 1 year. I bought another. Lasted only 4 months until it too is displaying NO OP! This is a really good IDEA!!! But You take one good look inside and see the plastic gears to control the switch, It's CHEAP. You'd think they would just make a small relay circut to open and close it instead of trying to make the 1.5 volt battery open and close the Switch, Yes, the battery is needed to supply the computer inside since you wouldn't want the stupid thing to reset or have to reprogram it every time the power went out. I really enjoyed the first one since it lasted 1 year I actually went and bought another one Now I am taking them back to Home Depot since they are kind of spendy and I feel like I got screwed when I bought it the second time. I am sure the problem lies with in the cheap plastic gears that get jamed and no longer be able to open or close the switch. I tried to move the wheels but the problem remains."
3,JG in Kansas,"I have used this timer for almost 5 years and this had worked up to now. I use it only in the winter to turn on a heated tile floor in the bathroom on a 220V current. I had it programmed to turn on a different time nearly every day depending on my work and activity schedule. It wasn't working this fall when I started it, but I saw low battery and tried to replace that. I kept rescheduling the automatic timer and finally got it to work once. To turn off my tile floor, but now I cannot do a manual override on the tile floor swith. I was going to get another, but after reading all the reviews, I think I had an exceptional unit that lasted a very long time. I am really not willing to get another, because I have to hire an electrician to install it and that is costly."
1,Good product conecpt. Very poor execution.,"I have had four units less than a year and have already had to replace two. My brother has even more and is is having to replace them regularly. They seem to have a bulky and cheezy motorized relay that is not very confidence inspiring when you hear it run. Based on our experience your chances are less than 50% that a unit will last a year. If you really want to buy one of these, buy at a store close to your house since you'll be making frequent visits to return these. You don't want to have to keep mailing them back. As long as Home Depot keeps replacing them no cost, I'll keep them going since they are a good product concept and I see no other alternatives to what these do. When Home Depot stops carrying/replacing them, I intend to get rid of them.If you value your time or sanity, try real hard to avoid this product."
4,Intermatic Digital SS7C 7-Day Programmable Wall Switch Timer,Item came within just a few days of ordering and is working fine. Very happy!
3,Intermatic IS making this right,"After reading Mark Twain's review, I felt compelled to share that I've been in contact with Intermatic and not only are they willing to immediately replace my two malfunctioning timers, they are also in the midst of redesigning them to fix this issue, and they will send me two MORE timers once the redesigned units are available. All for free. This speaks VERY highly of Intermatic, and the Home Depot employee who said they 'choose do nothing about it' couldn't be more wrong."
1,See 'Pawns in the Game' for the Truth,"Yes. Download and read 'Pawns in the Game' by William Guy Carr, if you want the truth about this horrible and bloody war. It was the same sort of scenario as the USSR - a Jewish attempt to take over Spain. George Orwell ahd no idea - all his publishers were Jews; he was a 'useful idiot'."
5,a must read for any student of politics or military history,this book is a personnal favorite of mine. It manages to attain the balance of politics and frontline action in a very smoooth fashion. This book also gives an idea to the political arena just before the second world war. if you enjoy political writing stripped of BS. He states his opinions on the situation on the frontline and political turmoil within the Republican party. My review doesnt do the book justice buy it or check it out from the library youll be thankful you did.
1,Great book...terrible printed edition,"The book is, of course, a classic. But the published edition sent to me by the seller was absolutely terrible. It must have been printed by a child under 12, or a person who could barely read English. Numerous spelling errors just about every page, truncated sentences, and all in all barely readable at points. I will never order from this seller again - I feel ripped off."
3,George Orwell's interesting memoir of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War,"""Homage to Catalonia"" is a memoir of George Orwell's experiences during the Spanish Civil War. A committed socialist, Orwell was right in the thick of the action fighting on the side of the doomed Republic.The book is at its best when it gives Orwell's first-hand account of life as a soldier, but is less compelling when he attempts to explain the complicated Republican politics, rivally, and in-fighting of the time.Orwell's socialist politics also seem rather naive these days, given what has happened in the intervening 70 years.Interesting for its personal insights, but read Anthony Beevor's great book for a comprehensive history of the Spanish Civil War."
3,Just okay,"I liked this book, but it did drag on in the middle. I hoped for more about Catalonia, but this book is really about war. I'm glad I read it, but it just wasn't what I expected."
2,Was suppose to be a hardcover,"Under the description of this book it was labeled as hardcover. It was very much not a hardcover, it is in fact very paperback. It also took quite a while to get here. Bad form."
3,Homage to the Subjective Eye,"The book was insightful and helped explain the other Fascist country in Europe that we don't think about much anymore - Spain. It's very interesting to read it now while following the misinformation being presented daily about the debt crisis occurring in Europe. Orwell's perspective on human behaviour and his morality helps keep the narrative going, but I couldn't finish the book in one sitting. If you like Animal Farm and 1984, his recollections help put into perspective how he got the inspiration for his fiction."
4,Great Story - Some Embellishment,"As noted by other reviewer, Orwell did, in some cases, exaggerate or fictionalize portions of his journalistic writings and therefore it is difficult to categorize this book as the definitive book on the Spanish Civil War. It is essentially accurate, with fictionalized accounts used by Orwell to enhance the dogma (which some call ""truths"" that he is wishing to portray. (ASIN:0871404109 George Orwell: Diaries). The book is a FANTASTIC read told from the disenchanted view of a man who once idealized communism and then found it just as corrupt as the other political movements and classes that he despised. It is an excellent depiction of the grand ideals with which many men -- not just Englishmen, but also including leftist Americans -- volunteered for the war, only to be disillusioned when facing the realities of a civil war. The essential feelings of disenchantment and the realities of the experience for many are compelling and more than worth the reading."
5,Truth is beauty,"The author's first-hand experience of the egalitarian society created by genuine anarchists in Spain's Civil War, and the valiant efforts to protect it against all kinds of fascism, is a useful counterpoint to the offhand references in American media to ""anarchists"" as irrational and immature thugs. I suggest that you find and read this book immediately. ..."
3,"Great book, careless edition","The book is a must read, but I very much disliked this edition.If you love books, as I do, you may want to get one that doesn't say CHPATER as a header of 'every' chapter. This edition feels careless overall, I didn't expect that being sold directly from Amazon."
4,"Beautiful Thoughts, Ugly Circumstances","Orwell's book is a chronicle of the Spanish Civil War through the author's eyes, but it is far more interesting as a meditation on war, politics, journalism, and idealism. Orwell's real strength lies in candid self-analysis, and his experiences sitting in the miserable trenches of Catalonia and witnessing political squabbles in Barcelona are vaulted from their particular dated circumstances and given universal significance. This is not a work of genius, but it is a personal and very human look at war, probably more relevant now than it was when it was written. Spain has changed considerably, as has the art of war, but human nature in times of conflict is very much the same."
4,a great analysis of the Spanish Civil War,"George Orwell, in his usual ""live free or die"" mentality, tells his personal experiences during the Spanish Civil War. Although, interesting, it was, at times boring.One of the most ironic points Orwell explains in the book is how the USSR essentially sold out its ""fellow socialists"" in pursuit of its own best interests. You'll have to read to understand. And you should if you are at all interested in the Spanish Civil War."
4,Viva Orwell!,"I have read quite a few of Orwell's books, but this one has to be my favourite. The reason being that it is one of the easiest ways to understand war. It tells it's tale from the point of view of someone who lived through it. It showed the high points, and the low points. What really makes this book stand out is its human quality. Orwell was not a soldier in the traditional sense,he just felt compelled to fight faschism, and that is what makes this book so special. Another aspect of this book that i liked so much was it's journalistic qualities. I suggest everyone reads this book."
5,Compulsively readable...,"As with most everything Orwell, this book will not have you leafing ahead impatiently to find out if and when things get good. If there is one book you read on the Spanish Civil War (and I bet it will be only one), this should be it."
3,TRUE LIFE VIOLENCE IS TOUGH VIEWING,"RESURRECTION MAN is based on the book by Eoin Mc Namee,which in turn,is based on the Shankill Butchers who terrorised Belfast from 1975 to 1977. Victor Kelly(Stuart Townsend)hates Catholics with a passion.His mother(Brenda Fricket)thinks the world of him.One night,he carves up an innocent Catholic walking home from work into bloody shreds. Reporter Ryan(James Nesbitt,WAKING NED)is determined to unmask the killers,even though he is a drunk who beats up his wife. Notable for Townsend's chilling performance,RESURRECTION MAN is very noir but at times is a bit unpleasent. Not ahorror fim,more of a drama."
3,"Very Violent Movie, Good Cast","The violence in this movie makes it not for everybody. The story of a good-looking, charismatic psychopath who seems to enjoy gory killing, not only of random victims but also anyone who crosses, or is perceived as crossing, him. The cast is excellent, including Brenda Fricker as the adoring if idiotic mother and a number of able Irish actors familiar to viewers of Irish and British films--James Nesbitt, Sean McGinley, John Hannah (o.k., Scots too). However, the star of this bloodbath is the most riveting--Stuart Townsend, whose dark good looks lend themselves admirably to the role of the black-clad killer, leader of the ""Resurrection Men""/Shankill Butchers and darling of his mum. Not really an enjoyable movie but an interesting one."
5,Bravo Brodo and Sharnoff!,"Stunning photographs, clear, well written text, engaging and a ""must"" for all those interested in learning more about the wonderful world of lichens!A great ""coffee table"" book to entice non-lichenologists. Warning: Highly likely to induce lichenophilia!"
5,Brodo's Lichens,"Unfortunatley there are not many texts on Lichens. Brodo et al have done an excellent job with keys, pictures and discuss to allow one to key out and identify most US lichens."
5,Ditto previous reviewer,I was introduced to Dave Mason through this disc and I was instantly captivated. This is a very well produced Live album. It one of the best live albums and belongs with the likes of the stones get you ya's ya's out and little feat's waiting for columbus. I am equally irritated as the previous reviewer that it is still out of stock after all these years.
5,"not on c d, but tape was excellent.","dave along with jim kreegar on 12 string accoustic are excellent. too bad ""certified live"" is not on c d. would love to have it. would love to have cassette of it, also."
1,"Hollywood, get over yourselves!","There was some great lines and the ending was funny. Still, it was a movie spoofing about itself. It really wasn't all that good. Yes, plenty of celebrities. Still so what?"
1,How can anyone LIKE this pile o shart??? IT SUCKS!!!!!,"Definatly one of the worst movies ever. The dialog is so boring I had an A.D.D. attack trying to watch it. I usally never turn a movie off in the middle but I had to do it with this one. I tore it out of my laserdisc player and smashed it, so I would never have to suffer through this again. The characters are so lame I did'nt even care about who was threating his life. I wanted the stalker to go ahead and kill them all already. Man this movie is making me enraged just typing about it. IT FU**IN SUCKS!!!!! And it is really dated."
5,Just plain excellent,"Robert Altman doesn't exactly have the best track record when it comes to films, but a few stand out: M*A*S*H, The Long Goodbye, and this one. The casting of Tim Robbins is particularly inspired--all the deviousness behind such a cherubic face. Everything about this film is self-conscious: from the 8-minute tracking shot where characters talk about other tracking shots, to the screenwriter and his brother playing a screenwriter and his brother, even to who is nude and why--everything is a commentary on Hollywood and on The Player itself.Watch this movie not for the plot, which is a simple murder mystery thriller, but more for the in-jokes, the film references, and, most fun of all, for the Spot-the-Star game. Most of all, this movie is a load of fun for buffs."
5,This movie is sooooo black!,"I absolutely love this movie. You will never find a more in-depth look at inside Hollywood than this. This movie manages to include both extremely funny moments and extremely dark ones. Tim Robbins best acting job to date, and one of my favorite films of all time. A must-see for any movie fan, or anyone for that matter."
4,The Altman Renaissance,"Too young at the time to appreciate early Altman, this helped change my opinion of him forever. Very rich in characters and character, it's consistently rewarding in the wealth of actors in small but indelible roles, all in the service of a critique of Hollywood, making it seem anything but glamorous or desirable."
4,Entertaining,"This is a Hollywood insider's movie.The people in Kansas don't give a damn about how movies are made.Yeah, it's tough to sympathize with Hollywood people and their ""troubles"", but this is an entertaining film."
4,Great Satire on Hollywood,"This is one of the most underrated films in Hollywood about Hollywood. The main characters in the film give excellent performances and there are enough cameo appearances to make this one of the most star filled films of all time. The only performance that was lost on me was Whoopie Goldberg's which I felt was too arrogant and condescending to be convincing. Goldberg couldn't resist making a predictable jab about the Rodney King riot, the only instance in which I felt the film unsuccessfully attempted to mix real life politics and entertainment. Aside from this, the film delivers on all counts, taking us through the forbidden, seldom seen world of film making, in which everyone seems to be expendable and no one seems to maintain control. If there is a lesson to be learned here, it's that life presents all of us with luck, circumstance and opportunity. And no one understands this better than Hollywood."
5,The Player - New Line Platinum Series,"This one has everything but the kitchen sink. At once a celebration and satire of filmmaking and Hollywood, this one of those movies you can watch with your friends over and over and see new stuff all the time. Made with a wink to the audience this movie is even better than them. Great stuff!"
2,"Amoral, Boring, and Unlikely -","The movie begins with a lot of industry self-adulation, then develops a plausible plot (angry rejected writer seeking revenge is accidentally killed in self-defense). Eventually the police realize what happened, but their only witness is unable to identify the killer. No matter - killer/script reviewer Tim Robbins seemingly pursues a death wish by dumping his girl-friend (motivating her to rat him out), and then confesses to the murdered writer's girl-friend who he eventually marries. Blah -"
2,Cameos and satire do not a movie make,"Sure, I loved all of the stars in the movie. I mean, who wouldn't? And of course I found the satire and critical eye taken with regard to the big business of Hollywood to be interesting. But in the end I found the movie to be wholly uncompelling. I never really laughed, which had I done so regularly, would have made this movie very good.I also never really cared about any character in the movie. Maybe you could say that this is Altman's point, but it still doesn't make the movie any more entertaining.All in all, this movie seemed just OK. That's a horrible review for a Tim Robbins movie, because I think he's great."
2,Forget it unless you're an Altman fan,"I rented this movie on the advice of a friend that it was ""a great movie"". I'm still not sure what she saw in the film, but I definitely was not entertained. The film never got the groove going and you'll know how it ends well before Altman gets around to summing it up. If you aren't interested in ""fashionable"" films then you can feel comfortable skipping this one."
2,The Player? you mean The Sleeper!,"Tim Robbins' performance as Griffin Mills in the only redeaming thing that this movie has to offer. The plot is very weak and moves along with all of the swiftness of molasas uphill. This movie was at least one hour to long. I realize that it was supposed to be a spoof on the real Hollywood process, but come on! The film techniques that were used made the plot entirely to predictable. I knew how the movie was going to end fifteen min. into it. If you are looking for an exciteing and a fast paced movie, this one is not it!"
4,A Kristofferson Sleeper,"This record received mixed notices upon its release way back in 1974. I remember buying it as soon as it came out, and not knowing what to make of it. The songwriting, for one thing, is much more abstract than his fameous ""classic"" songs (""Help Me Make It Though the Night"" and all the rest) that the songs seem like they could have been written by a different person. Compare ""Stairway to the Bottom,"" which has a 1967 copyright to any of the other tracks on this album, and the difference is pretty striking.Happily, this record has really aged well, though. I continue to listen to it even after 30 years! This record features strong (albeit abstract) songs along with first rate arrangements and musicianship from Kris's band. The sound quality on my vinyl LP is excellent, mastered by the pros at The Mastering Lab, so the CD has potential for fine sound, too."
4,Excellent section on pronunciation,"Although this book has been out of print for years, it should still be obtained by any serious student of Swedish. The opening section on pronunciation is outstanding; clear, well-written, and not too technical. The rest of the book is essentially a grammar text with exercises, so for more practical information the interested learner would need to get a more modern book like the newer ""Teach Yourself Swedish"" or ""Colloquial Swedish"". However, for traditional ""grammar and translation"", this book is still useful. I got my copy (1975 printing) many years ago when it was selling for [money]."
3,It died 20 feet close to the finish line,"Nothing brings me down more than a ""it's going so well"" science fiction book that lets you down at the very ending. This editor should be fired for not proposing a diferent line of ending"
4,"Quick, entertaining and enjoyable","Joe Haldeman can write. And he can write well. He is consistant in all of his works for creating interesting plotlines and following through with them til the end of the book. Camouflage is no exception. It's an interesting story on it's face about two different aliens who have been roaming the planet for at least a million years - they know they are different from the rest of the creatures on Earth, but don't quite know why or how. One alien becomes almost human in it's capacity to feel empathy and desire to learn, while the other is hell bent on creating destruction and causing pain. Although it would be easy as a reader to try to analyze what Haldeman is trying to say through these two characters, it's really not necessary in terms of enjoying the book. Just sit back and enjoy the ride."
3,"Fun to read. A page turner, but not Nebula award material","My title says most of what I have to say. You can read this book quickly and enjoy it. It moves fast and is fun, but I don't understand how this got the Nebula award. It doesn't compare with past winners like Dune, Flowers for Algernon, Left Hand of Darkness, Neuromancer. I just don't get it. Maybe nothing very impressive was written the year it got the award."
3,All Start And No Finish,"I am a fan of Haldeman and I often use the Nebula Awards as a quick guide to buying SciFi, but in this case I was mostly disappointed. The book won the 2005 Best Novel Nebula Award and it is probably one of the weakest winners in recent memory.The premise and the writing are as good as expected from Haldeman, put the promise is never kept. In the end nothing is explained nor even resolved. The ending is just not there. I enjoyed reading the book and was really excited about seeing how Haldeman tied it all together; he didn't. I read the Kindle edition and I thought that somehow I was missing a chapter or something. I checked back to make sure.I don't think that novels have to have `spell it out' type endings, but you are left with basic questions about he characters, the plot, and the outcome. I'll give this three stars for the writing but I would only give it a half-hearted recommendation."
3,Fast reading and fun in parts,"This fanatsy thriller, deceptively packaged as science fiction, is written in a light, entertaining style. It has some relatively mild gore and sensibly restrained sexual situations. Mr. Haldeman's professionalism shows in the way he prods readers to turn pages, but the observations of human nature aren't too fresh. I agree with other reviewers who thought the resolution was rushed, but the action sequences leading immediately to it filled pages without adding significantly to the suspense.The writing and concepts seem to be aimed at readers in their middle teens, making this a fast read.Overall, CAMOUFLAGE reflects the current state of science fiction publishing in the USA. Hard to believe this outshone all else to win the Nebula, but it is better than a lot of what comes from melding fantasy and science fiction."
4,"good, sort of ""quick"" ending","The story line was good. I enjoyed reading about the changeling's journey thru history. Only drawback, the ending. It's a very quick wrapup that seems like the author said oops my book can only be 280 pages and I'm at 278 so I'd better put an ending on it."
2,The ending WHAT?,Very well writen stoy about the 'good' shape shifter. Book would have been great with just that story... the whole bad shapeshifter story... sorry... lost me... total let down of an ending... Sure the reveal was a surprise but the culmination... bleh...
2,Good start - disappointing finish,"From the first few pages of the book, it promises to be an enjoyable read with a great premise that seems to have limitless potential. Unfortunately you quickly realize that the author wasn't really sure where to take this idea and how to develop it. Half way through the book you start to realize that this is not going anywhere and with every read page, my interest in the book was greatly diminishing. The ending feels rushed and completely dissatisfactory, as though the author decided that he wrote enough for publishing complete book and didn't feel like putting any effort in completing the story. To add to this, lots of things in the book don't really make much sense from any logical point of view. I'm not sorry about the money I paid for the book, I am sorry for the time I wasted reading.."
3,Great except the ending,"This is a fun book of alien contact that lands somewhere between ""E.T."" and ""Species"". Good story told in nice clear prose, but the ending is very abrupt and rushed. It's enjoyable but could have been better."
3,This is an ending?,"To the above reviews let me add one thing. The book ends so abruptly that I thought the last few pages were missing. ""He stepped into the chamber and began to glow."" This is an ending? It says that Haldeman either ran out of plot or the editor did a terribly climsy job. Lately Haldeman seems to be suffering from the Michael Crichton Syndrome: great start, great story, terrible ending."
4,not long enough....,"An excellent writer, but i feel this book could have been longer and contained more story content on the Chamleon...a very readable and gripping story though and a nice ending..."
4,"A well shaped novel, looking for a sequel","Joe, I am always happy to see you work out for sale! This was no exception. Joe, please, please give us a follow up tome. This story line has tons more material to explore and explain."
2,Nice Concept- Poor Execution,I liked the concept of two aliens roaming the planet changing themselves and events around them. This could have been a much better book but I got the sense that the Author was rushing to get to the end. The first third of the book is intriguing but then its downhill from there. I think he should take this story re-write it when he has some time to really finish it.
2,"He tried, but failed...","This book was over all interesting. A quick read that engrosed at parts, but left me feeling cheated. He went in to too much detail in parts that didn't matter to the over all story. Other parts that were essential leave the reader questioning his motives. The end felt like the author just got tired of rambling on and decided to put the story out of its proverbial misery.Frankly, it just disappointed me."
1,... plot for a television pilot?,I like Haldeman... well liked anyway.What could have been a terrific story ends up with lack of depth and is rife with inconsistency in logic and technology. The good news however is that this type of effort draws television production like mice to that which is cheesy.
4,Open minded aliens,"This was my first book by Haldeman, and I enjoyed it. The story immediately drew me in. I don't usually read books about aliens, usually avoiding anything about outerspace, but this was worth the read. Its opened up my mind to check out more science fiction, with and without more aliens in them. Since reading everyone elses reviews, I'm looking forward to checking out more books by this author especially."
3,Fair entertainment,"Haldeman is among my favorite SF authors. His first novel,The Forever War, is among the best SF ever written, so I keep coming back to his other work, to be awed all over again.Sad to say, it keeps not happening. Oh, this ""alien among us"" story stands out in that genre. In particular, Haldeman does a good job of showing the how imitation of humanity starts to turn the imitator human. But the ending, when it comes, seems abrupt and seems to leave too much dangling - not least a bit of potential sequel-bait.Haldeman's craft is never in doubt. He writes clearly and (with a few glitches) believably. Brilliance comes only rarely, though even to writers that have displayed brilliance before. On the whole, I find this forgettable.-- wiredweird"
3,"Starts out super good, then dwindles","This book engaged me right away: neat idea; fascinating development; good writing without excess detail; good pacing. I was totally into it.Then in the middle of the book, things started to go downhill: ***SPOILERS BELOW***The changeling stops being an alien and starts to become more human, which makes the character much less interesting and more predictable. And then there is a stupid and useless love interest/relationship that really diminishes the story. The only other interesting character besides the Changeling is the Chameleon, who really doesn't get much page time or development. And the ending is really bad - just corny and stupid.Even saying all that, the book was still overall entertaining and I read it quickly. I am looking forward to reading more of Joe Haldeman's books."

5,cool moondo!,"When the phone was delivered it was very exciting for me I have never owned a cordless phone in my life. I really liked walking around the house while I talked.When I first looked at the reviews on the internet one girl said ""the phone is great but there is one problem the instructions never said you had to call your phone company to setup the caller id"" well the girl is wrong. When I had setup my phone I had my brother call the phone's phone number the caller id worked by itself without the phone company having to come and setup the caller id. So there is nothing wrong with the phone. MY OPINION IS YOU REALLY SHOULD BUY THIS PHONE!"
1,"The wankiest, most pretentious song ever written","""Streets of London""? Bleeeeuuuuuucccchhhhhh!All I can say to anyone who sings this pretentious load of old cobblers is ""Get folked!"".Along with ""Where do you go to my lovely"", ""The Streets of London"" is easily among the most pretentious and silly songs ever written. Good taste? Well, we ain't takin' Rameau, Frank, Buxtehude, Messiaen, Schnittke, Boulez, Kraftwerk or Brian Eno here! :-))We're talkin' schlock an' schmaltz!If you arrive at a dinner party and your host (or hostess) puts on this disc (or ""Where do you go to my lovely""), I would strongly suggest that you politely, but promptly make your excuses and leave. Such a social occasion is likely to be inhabited by people who you will be well advised to avoid.Just a friendly warning!Ciao!"
1,NOT All Natural,"The description says these are ""all natural."" I was amazed as the colors are very vibrant, so I checked their website. They are NOT natural and are packed with artificial, petroleum-based colors like most other colored sprinkles. If you're looking for naturally colored sprinkles & colorings, try ChocolateCraftKits dot com."
1,"Beware, Un-official DVD-R release!","This is an un-official DVD-R release of the show, the official release is the yellow ""Complete Series"" box.The episodes here are mastered from dirty, scratched, faded 16mm film prints.Avoid this! Get the official release."
3,Hard Going,"The thought in this book is profound and enlightening, the style and language are clear enough, but I found it unbearably hard going to get through it."
1,Disappointed,"I took the 5 star reviews on faith and I am not happy. The sound quality is poor, to put it lightly. This supercedes the music in every way. Each track sounds like the one before. Don't bother...."
4,Nice Watch,"I really like this watch. Inexpensive, stylish, big/easy to read, not heavy. I like the way the date reads out with 3 days shown with today in the middle, easier to read than other watches I have or have had.Only thing to mention is that the second hand is the dial at the bottom of the face, the big red hand is the Stop Watch hand"
4,He still is my Hero,"I have adored Randolph Scott ever since I was a little girl. This book was not disappointing to me at all. As far as the book about his sex life, gee it is funny that this author chose to write this after BOTH actors were dead. People forget that when Cary Grant and Randolph Scott were living together, it was not socially acceptable to be living with women when you were not married to them . I hardly think that if they had a problem, Randolph Scott would not have been married for 45 years to one woman and look at how many times Cary Grant was married. I was not a ""Grant"" fan but I sure respected Mr. Scott and how he kept his private life to himself. To me, Randolph Scott was the best looking man I have ever seen and he only got better with age. Then there was that quiet, gentleman nature about him that not another Actor in these days has. Do I love and respect him, Yes, I do. Thanks to his son also for sharing his love and respect for his father."
3,"Not a Scott bio, but a tribute of son to father","Originally published as ""In the Footsteps of the Giant,"" (and listed on amazon.com under that title as well), this is a loving tribute of a son for his father. It is not at all a revelatory book, nor in any sense a biography of interest to film scholars. It earnestly refutes rumors regarding Scott's sexual orientation, but unfortunately does so only by calling the rumors ugly and baseless. I personally find the rumors less than convincing, but this book by Scott fils is not part of why I don't believe them. There is less insight into Randolph Scott than one would have liked here, and perhaps a little more about the son than the average film student needs. But it's a valuable book nonetheless, simply because it's one of the few pebbles in the gaping hole where a book-length study of Scott's life and career should be."
1,Not a Randolph Scott biography....,"This book was disappointing. I was expecting a Randolph Scott biography. What I got was a loving tribute to a father by his son. As C.H. Scott wrote, ""This is an account of my relationship with my father, the thoughts we shared and the experiences I had with him."" If I deleted Randolph Scott's name from the book, I could just as easily have been reading about my own father. The reader will learn little about Randolph Scott, other than he was a good father whose son loved/loves him."
3,Biographical crumbs,"As one who needed to clear cerebral cobwebs formed while I watched, as a boy in the 50's, Randolph Scott in Saturday westerns, I was tantalized by every chapter of What Ever Happened to Randolph Scott?. To add to this reader's exasperation with this mysteriously superficial biography, Randolph Scott's adopted son states at several points that Randolph's life was much more complex than the son is willing to reveal out of respect to Randolph's wife and friends. My guess is that Randolph's family still controls what is by all accounts a fabulous estate; thus both their own as well as Randolph's privacy interests will live on. If the family will not cooperate with an effort to substantiate and compile a definitive biography, there is virtually no chance that the son will ever be able to tell us more.Nonetheless, my curiousity was relieved and I am grateful for crumbs.Alexander Witkowski"
5,Savory and Satisfying Comfort Food,"I purchased this book in 1967, it was a set of three (BC Good and Easy, BC Hostess Cookbook, and BC Dinner in a Dish) that I ordered through the mail. It's funny now as I agonized over parting with the $9.00, which included shipping, for all three cookbooks. In looking back I could have paid $100 or more as these books have been faithful companions throughout my cooking journey. I love cooking; I've planned parties for 4 to 1,000 guests; I've written cooking columns for three newspapers, and two of my own cookbooks, but after all these years I still find myself referring to the BC Dinner in a Dish when I'm in the mood for comfort food like Sombrero Pie, Chicken Dinner Pie or Arroz Con Pollo...yum! These are great books for the beginner or the experienced cook and they're worth their weight in gold. Cynthia Briggs, Cookbook AuthorPork Chops and Applesauce: A Collection of Recipes and ReflectionsandSweet Apple Temptations"
4,bought mainly for historical perspective,I bought this as a curiosity to see what recipes were popular back in the 60's and to get tips on dinners for large crowds. The tips are useful. Anything to help stay out of the kitchen during a dinner party is good. The recipes are OK but basic. Basic is good in this case because they are fairly dated and it makes the recipes easier to manipulate. I tried several with success but switched out most of the dried or canned ingredients for fresh. The recipes are especially good for potlucks and buffet service but they should be since that is what the book is all about. Also good if you like to make enough for leftovers later in the week.The condition of the book book was as advertised and arrived on schedule.
4,Do it yourself or learning the ropes,"I used this and another, more detailed book, to complete my own survey on an inexpensive boat with a measure of confidence. I felt that I could gauge the safety and useability of all the major systems of the boat within reason..is it safe, does it work properly, etc.I didn't always understand the why behind some analyses, but the average person can easily use the book to a) perform a basic survey on an inexpensive boat, or b) winnow the acceptable from the unaccptable before paying a professional to complete a thorough survey."
3,Lots of Info,"I purchased this book to help me while looking at boats to purchase. I was a first time boat buyer and felt lost. If I had taken the time to read this all the way through I am sure it would have helped me to make a very informed decision, but I was only able to skim it minuets before I went to look at the boat I eventually bought. That being said, the skimming I was able to do did help me to see a few flaws that I used to bring the price down. This book is chocked full of info, but I would not recommend this to a first time boat buyer like myself. This book is better suited for someone with a boat that is in need of restoration and does not know where to start. This book will help you evaluate the true condition of any boat and help to lay out a plan for repairs. For those of you that want to perform those repairs yourself you should look at ""This Old Boat"" by Don Casey."
5,Star Wars,Excellent. A really good look into the lives of several very inportant characters in the Jedi Legacy. Back stories (and adventured) that we had not heard before.
1,poor condition,Book was obviously well used from library with old cracked protector and just not something you want in your personal library. Also whole story was disappointing after her other 2......my first negative experience so no big deal
4,great product,"great product but is does have a glich. When charging the battery, and you restart the cp, it give me a message, ""use original battery"" and will start a 10 second count down and shut the cp off. This will happen at least 3 time. To restart the cp I need to plug the charger back and restart the cp at least twice."
1,Error notification,"This is not a review. You are showing the wrong graphic for this product - the cover of a video from Nirvair Singh, not Carol Carlson!"
2,Its not what you think,"First of all I want to thank the people who sent this game within 3 days. Thank you I was suprised how fast this arrived in the mail! I was also suprised how much I did not enjoy this stuff pack. I thought I was getting more hairstyles but they only had five that were wedding styles. Its ok if you like your sims getting married and having birthday parties, but other than that you can past. This stuff pack is not necessarily needed for your Sims 2 enjoyment. I suggest H&M Fashion! Actually I suggest any stuff pack that does not have SECROM!! Anyway thank you guys once again!"
4,Pretty good but not for $20,"This stuff pack includes mostly items for use in weddings and birthday celebrations, including themed walls and floors, additional cakes, balloons, and bridal and bridesmaids dresses. The birthday cakes are very effective for aging babies to toddlers. If you don't do wedding parties much, then you should probably skip it. Also, I recommend not paying more than $[...] for any stuff pack."
3,You probably won't use this stuff too much,"First of all, this is a ""stuff"" pack, not an expansion pack. This means that it just contains new items instead of new gameplay. This pack contains just a few items that most ""Sims 2"" players won't use that much. It just has a few wedding dresses, a few tuxedos, a few adult women's hairstyles, and a few little wedding items. It's great if you have a lot of weddings, but otherwise, it really isn't worth the money. It just has a few items. Maybe 10 new clothes for men, 10 new clothes for women, and 5 new clothes for both boys and girls. A few wedding arches, and a buffet or two. If you really want it get it for $10 or less, but, be warned, there aren't that many items."
4,Bought this expansion as a gift,"The recipient was happy with the content. Even though its an old game, it installed and runs on a newer computer with no problems."
3,Yet another stuff pack,"I'm not a huge fan of Stuff Packs. They just add things to your game. Most of these ""things"" you can get free at Sims 2 sites for modding. I have barely used anything from this pack. Some of the wedding accessories are nice if you are making a story or movie. Huge list of modding sites at [...]"
2,Disappointed Simmer,"I love Sims 2 but this ""Celebration Stuff Pack"" is a waste of money. I wish they would give you more than 4.5 mintues to have a party. And I wish you could invite over more than 2 guests. I think the creators probably added: 2 more carpets, 2 banners, 3 cakes, a buffet table, side table, 3 or 4 more chairs, 2 ballon choices, and maybe 9 more other things that I can't think of right now. If you are really looking for something that adds more depth to the game and that you will get more use of then get the ""Glamour Life Stuff pack"". Don't waste your money even if it is just $9.99 get something else instead."
1,WASTE OF CASH- A TEENS REVIEW,"Before you think about buying this......DONT1.THE STUFF IS STUPID AND IS ONLY GOOD WHEN THROWING PARTES.HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THROW A PARTY WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME?!!2.YES, SOME ITEMS CAN ONLY BE BOUGHT IN STORES.BUT NOT IN THESE SILLY LITTLE STUFF PACKS.STOP BING CHEAP AND BUY THE EXPANSION PACKS FOR 100S OF NEW ITEM AND MORE OPEN POSSIBILITIES.3.WHY BUT THIS FOR $17 WHICH ONLY HAS A FEW ITEMS WHEN YOU CAN GO TO A REPUTABLE FAN SITE AND DOWNLOAD MILLIONS OF STUFF FOR FREE.?!"
4,Just got it...so far it's okay,"I haven't yet had the time to fully explore this stuff pack, but from what I've seen it's a little less than I had hoped for. I've got a thing for weddings and foolishly thought this would provide the ability to have a church wedding on a community lot...it looked like that was happening in one of the screen shots. This is not true. You still cannot place a wedding arch on a community lot, much to my disappointment. The items themselves are pretty cool and you can now have veils for the brides. I like it overall, and I feel okay with spending $15 on it. I don't think I would have payed $20."
3,It's a'right,"I'm a sims 2 addict. Love every game and expansion, but I admit I was disappointed in this title. Many of the items were so-so. If you like having parties with the sims some of these objects might be useful. But in day-to-day sims 2 use they were sadly lacking.I guess I'd like to see a few more practical items such as new 'cookable' food, or more modern clothing/hairstyles.I also could not get my sims to eat any of the new cakes. The only option was to dispose of it, even after I just purchased them.Disappointing."
3,Entertaining for some Sims . . .,"This is a nice, reasonably thorough collection of Party-themed items for Sims 2. If you like throwing parties for your Sims, this expansion pack is great and well worth the cost. If you tend to let birthdays, graduations and weddings pass without notice, then you probably won't find the selection all that exciting. I'm looking forward to using the lovely wedding decorations and throw a real shindig for my engaged couple once they graduate college."
2,How often do you throw a party?,"I think that the SIMS have gone overboard. They are trying to cash in on what some great designers have done on the internet. Seriously you would be better off giving your $20 to some SIMS website that creats houses,clothing,hair,etc. This expansion is a waste. (Time and Money)I will the would create something ORIGINAL for the game. They keep leashing out the SAME expansions that they did for SIMS1 that they are issuing for THE SIMS2. Something original would be nice."
3,No Instructions,"First of all I admit it. I am a beginner.(HUGE, monster piles of Sawdust, not so many finished projects!)I have mostly Dewalt stuff, and I love it. Great tools (Except for Belt Sander) and these look like they are no exception...However I don't see what they are supposed to thread into. The bases on my router (DW618)aren't threaded and the holes in the bases are bigger then the templates. I know HOW to use them (in theory), and need to use them, but haven't figured out how to get them onto the router...Anyway, they get a 3 for lack of even the simplest instructions.And yes, I feel stupid, its probably simple."
2,No instructions Does NOT fit the router,"I have to agree with jeffery no instructions no way to attach to router yet they say ""fits ANY router model"""
3,Decent Functional Training Workouts,"These are functional training workouts. It's not bad, but I would not consider this a workout on its own.Functional training can be great for building stability and for improving everyday movements, but you still need to add strength training and more intense cardio to your routine to improve your overall fitness.I think this would be great to ADD to your training. I usually do these videos AFTER weight training or cardio.These videos alone did not raise my heart rate over 60% at any time.This is just my personal experience...."
2,One time listening music.,Kinda boring and artificial. Could be interesting for historians and collectioners. No any melodic inventions.
5,Great book!,I read this book years ago to my older children and they loved it! I'm now reading it to my youngest. He doesn't want me to stop reading!
5,The Shy Stegosaurus,"I have a friend whose grandson loves dinosaurs. I bought this book and ""The Enormous Egg"" for him. He will enjoy both. I've read both books to my class and they have liked them."
4,A Good Book About a Dinosaur,"This is simply a good book to enjoy. An interesting situation of a family living on a ranch, about to go under financially. The two children discover (or are discovered by) a stegosaurus that has been left alive over these many years. Shy of people, the stegosaurus remains hidden from everyone else until it sees an airplane, which it thinks is a flying reptile.Plot complications include escaped bank robbers, a discouraged paleontologist, and the 12 year old son who has the dinosaur pull their car into town in order to get help. The shy stegosaurus asks the boy to turn the car's headlights off, as the dinosaur thinks the car is staring at him (he's not very bright).I read this when I was younger, and it helped guide me into the earth sciences. An enjoyable read."
5,SHY STEGOSAURUS is coming back!,"I understand THE SHY STEGOSAURUS OF CRICKET CREEK will be back in a new edition no later than June 2001 -- a facsimile of the 50s hard cover, complete with reproduced dust jacket. This deserves to be read again; it is among the classic juvenile fantasies of the 50s, along with the Seuss books, and two others: THE ENORMOUS EGG, and DAVID AND THE PHOENIX. All are equally classic juvenile fiction, and fondly remembered, along with Otis Spofford and the gang, by people of baby boomer age - like me. Lampman wrote at least one sequel, by the way -- THE SHY STEGOSAURUS OF INDIAN SPRINGS."
2,Not all that... at all.,"The art in this book is pretty good, if a bit broader of stroke than I tend to like. Still, the imagery is solid, and the motions of the characters really carries itself off the page well.The rest of it is pretty much crap. The story is basic, with very little to endear one to the any of characters. The happenings are boring enough that I was distracted by the weather outside the window. The erotic part of it can be better attained by one's own imagination. Not what I would call a worthwhile read, and certainly not for the price I paid. If you see somewhere for $3 or so, pick it up. Otherwise, hang loose and look for some stuff you can count on. Or check my dumpster."
4,"I enjoyed it, even over and over again","Some children's videos I don't enjoy anymore after my son sees them several times, but this one has kept my interest. I loved the music and thought it quite appropriate for my 19-month old. My husband and I found new little jokes to laugh at each new time that we hadn't noticed before. (no, we weren't glued to the set.) Its not ""titillating"", but its not meant to be!"
4,My son loved it !,"I read where one person wrote the movie wasn't for children under four...I totally disagree. My 20 month old son loved it. He watched the entire movie ( more than once) and laughed and danced along with it. I know he can't fully understand everything that went on, but it certainly got his attention. He does watch Barney, Sesame Street and other TV shows, but this is the first MOVIE he sat through and watched till the end. So do not deprive your child, regardless of age, of watching the movie. Afterall every child is different and you won't know if yours will like it until you let them watch it !"
4,"I can't believe it, a GOOD Barney movie!","Of all the Barney movies I've seen, this is the only one I actually enjoyed watching. My 4 year old loved it, my 8 year old liked it. If you have a Barney lover in your family, and you would like to enjoy a movie together, I recommend ""Barney's Great Adventure""."
2,"Better acting than show, but drags","I write this review on behalf of my kids who have watched their fair share of Barney... Even though I was relieved to see realistic child actors, my kids (3-year-old twins) just don't like this very much. I think the format is a bit too long for the younger viewers. Perhaps older kids will like it, but in my case it was basically a waste of money..."
1,stupid,"This movie is very bad. It contains a nude dinosaur called Barney. and some retarded guy named Trevor doesn't believe in Barney. So a big comet fell out of sky. That was huge suspence. When Barney fell from the sky, I bet he was yelling swear words and acting like a moron when he was getting down. This movie should be banned everywhere, everybody will return this movie for a big refund of $100. Then the cops will arrest people who still have this video. Worst movie ever. Everybody hates this.. even God, man, they should think of something better like Barney and Heavy Metal."
2,bad,"This movie is a real movie. Not at all like the Barney on TV. It cannot hold my twins attention like the show. They are only 10 months old so they may like it when they are older, but it is not at all like I expected."
3,Enjoyable but sassy pre-teens in the cast,"We've had this video for a couple years and my daughter, now 5, has always enjoyed it. But today she used the phrase ""whatever"" to me and I racked my brain trying to think where she had heard that used. Well, it was this movie along with some other sassy phrases such as ""Talk to the hand because the face isn't here"". That kind of language is definitely not what you would expect from Barney and the kids are too impressionable at this age to have such a sloppy and sassy role models."
1,Inappropiate,"I have seen bad stuff, but this is ridicilous. What a stupid plot, they find a dumb egg. [ Sacrastically : ] Wow. What a cool plot! Why don't they eat the egg. And a kid steps his foot in cow crap. This should be rated R for drug refrences, alchochol-slurping scenes, scenes of nudity, mild violence and advanced cursing. Even a Barney fan will hate this.If you are lookin or buying for movies... don't buy this numbskull-written junk on DVD."
1,Imagine Steven Speilberg on a bad acid trip!!!,"Your kids deserve better stuff than this mess, only let them watch this if you want their brains to turn into a harmless lead by-product."
5,I love this movie!,"I am 92 years old and I love to watch Barney! I sit down with my grandkids (and my teddy) and watch Barney and Friends every day! I love the movie! I love how Barney eats the kids in evey episode. When my maid changes my diaper, I watch the movie!"
1,THIS MOVIE ISN'T FOR KIDS AT ALL,This movie isn't for kids. It has profanity and sceens of barney holding a lit cigar! it's a shame the way these people make these movies these days. I would have given it no stars but it wasn't an option. please parents out there think before you buy. please.
1,Barney should be banned,"With so many other quality alternatives (Sesame Street, Blues Clues), I will never understand the value of Barney and it's antispeptic, saccharine, artificial stories.Yes, for those of you who argue that your children love it, my children also love Barney, but they also like Bob the Builder, Elmo, Out of the Box, and many other shows. Just because a toddler likes something doesn't mean you should succomb to it. Barney is the most irritating and annoying character on television."
1,"Horrible, Miserable Movie!","I don't like this video and I don't reccomend this video to parents with 1 to 8 year old children. Lots of swears and unsmart events like the man cooking in his car. Why don't you go to Wendy's or Dairy Queen, you wingnut! It's so gross when the teenage boy steps in the cow manure and also when the man is eating and driving at the same time. I almost threw up that time! If you have a Barney loving toddler, I reccomend any Barney video besides this!"
5,Brava,"I remember a Metropolitan Opera broadcast singers roundtable in which the great Regine Crespin participated fairly late in her career. As they went around the table, the question was ""When you give a performance, what do you hope the audience will go away thinking?"" When it came to Crespin, her answer was ""I hope they will go away thinking 'She looks like she's lost twenty pounds', because I have!"" The audience was in hysterics for what seemed like half an hour.I trust this release, the few others currently available, and the considerable amount of recorded material not currently in release which should be, will attest to the unquestioned fact this extraordinary artist should, and will, be remembered for much, much more.May she live forever in our hearts."
2,Only for real fans!,"I was excited by the prospect of hearing a much loved voice in her best repertoire. unfortunately the reording quality is poor, and the arias often sung in translation. her Fiordiligi is uncomfortable. Yet her Penelope (Faure) is riveting. Listen to this one first!"
1,CDs don't work on XP,"My son had these programs for our OLD computer (Windowns 95) and loved them but his disks wouldn't load on the newer computer (XP) so we ordered new disks--I told him these probably won't work either--and they do not work on XP. Does anyone still have a Windows 95 machine in in operation? These are GREAT games, excellent, but will not work on XP. The disks arrived well sealed and good quality."
4,comment on an introduction to Chinese literature,"As admitted by the author, a slim volume can only scratch the surface of one of the world's great literatures. Nevertheless, Liu is a good scholar and has produced an excellent introduction."
5,The Second Beginning....,"To me, this is the Maiden album that really started it all. I agree that their debut was an excellent recording, but something was missing from that album. That something was Adrian Smith. Once he and Dave Murray got together it was all over. They are still in my mind the greatest guitar duo to play on the stage. Paul Di'anno also turns in a fine performance especially on tracks like Murders in the Rue Morgue and Wrathchild. This album is sheer power and is one of the top five that they ever released."
3,A bit disapointing,"Although this album is good, in my opinion it is not some of iron maidens best. The album has 2 good instrumentals on it ""Ides of March"" and ""Genghis Khan"" as well as ""Wrathchild"" and ""Puragatory"" done in the usual Maiden manner. However aside from that alot of the remainging songs on the album sound teh same there is not much variety. The vocals are also a bit disapointing contrasted to other Iron maiden albums. Get this album if you are a fan."
1,Stupid album.,Maybe Maiden's worst album. Far from the class of the later albums. (as well as from the previous one :). Not a single song in it to make it sound better.
2,FORGETABBLE EXPERIENCE,"This CD, along with both CD's recorded during the ""JANICK GERS AND BLAZE BAYLEY ERA"" is one of the weakest ever released by Mainde. It's totally silly. The first album, ""IRON MAIDEN"", is much better, much better !!! The only good point in ""KILLERS"" is that it marked the debut of guitarrist Adrian Smith, the man who, along with Bruce Dickinson, would lead MAIDEN to its glory days."
2,Weak,"Maiden fans, like myself, tend sometimes to be a little exagerated, and don't consider the band's weak times. THis ""Killers"" is one of them, no doubt a uninspired CD (""Murders in the RUe Morgue"" is fantastic, at least). The rest, compared to the whole of their work, is painfully weak!"
2,Better things to come,"Killers is a classic in metal releases, and proved very influental to later metal-releases but it comes nowhere near what Iron Maiden was to release later. The songs does not have the power or the quality of later releases, and Paul DiAnno simply does not come anywhere near Bruce Dickinson as a singer.The album meant alot to metal and thus is worth listning to, but it does not seem to hold any emediate qualities that are usualy atributed to Iron Maiden. The production is pretty bad, but it was too on Number of the Beast, so that is not what is to blame.I think that Iron Maiden simply matured...and got a worthy lead singer for their next album."
4,AMAZING IMPROVMENT IN PRODUCTION ...,"Dear Mr. Arsh Karma (the reviewer below). Thanks God you chose to buy ""KILLERS"" instead of ""NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING"" ...The latter one is a shame, while KILLERS is a masterpiece, the second album from Maiden, the first featuring ace producer Martin Birch and the first featuring ace guitarrist Adrian Smith. In this one, Maiden worked on songs that were already tried and proved for years playing live in the British pub scene. So they just refined it a little and went into the studios. The result was a tour-de-force of great metal music, great solos, Clive Burr's amazing drumming and Paul Di'anno's unique voice giving it all he could (I'm sorry, Bruce Dickinson, your voice is wonderful, but for sheer rock'n roll voice Di'anno was the one ). Steve Harris wrote all the songs for this album, with the exception of the title track, co-written with Di'anno."
2,Dissapointed,"The grill cooks fine, but stains easily. Initially I used it to heat tortillas and make quesadillas. Wherever something burned, there are spots that cannot be removed by soaking or scrubbing with brillo pads. Although the grill is still usable, it is not presentable and I cannot take it from stove to table-top as the item description suggested."
4,Good Grill Stuff,"This is great for small stuff on our charcoal grill. Sliders, shrimp, veggies, etc. It cleans up fairly easily, and has not warped over very hot coals. However, do not try to move it while it's hot - you'll need fireproof potholders - it's even too hot for a double layer of leather fireplace gloves and heavily quilted potholder mittens. Just let it cool on the grill instead of trying to serve from it. That's not really a fault, just that I didn't quite think it through before trying to lift it off the grill. It's relatively easy to clean - much easier than those old so-called non-stick grill things (might have been enameled steel) which I don't think were designed to be used on a really hot grill."
2,grillware,"I expected this tray to look like other pieces of Wilton Armetale I have. I doesn't -- it's gray, dull, and is not of uniform color. Maybe it is functional."
4,Perfect Blend of Style and Functionality,"This Wilton Armetale griddle is attractive yet solid enough to go on the grill. It works well cooking veggies and fish on our gas grill, as well as pancakes & grilled sandwiches on the stovetop. It heats quickly and distributes that heat evenly. It is not recommended to go in the dishwasher, which concerned me a bit at first, but fortunately I have found it easy to clean. I have been so impressed by this griddle that I am seriously considering getting more Wilton Armetale grillware pieces to have on hand at our next large BBQ. Recommended!"
5,FABULOUS!,"This grill pan is fantastic! I ordered it on a whim thinking we needed something bigger to make pancakes on and I have already used it for veggies on the grill and grilled cheese on the stove. The best thing - very easy to clean. And it is thin so it stores easily as well. LOVE Wilton Armetale products. Easy to use, nice to serve food on, easy to clean and easy to store."
4,it's a piece of metal,"Aluminum alloy...piece of metal to cook your food on. What's good, it's recycled, always good. What's maybe not so good...made in Mexico. And that's only a strange issue because of how the product is dressed up as coming from some heritage U.S. company. Ehh...it's a good product though."
3,"Quality Yes, practicality not so much.","This is a very nice looking, high quality griddle/hot plate item. If you like griddles and know how to use them most effectually then this may be the piece for you. If you are new to this type of cooking device I would stick with pans. This griddle was odd to use, like other hot plate type devices you can't really cook anything that is fatty on it like bacon or burgers because it splatters the cooking grease due to not having any sides. So if you cook breakfast you would use this for eggs and pancakes and a separate pan for bacon or sausage. Also food tended to stick to its surface and even stain the metal easily. I am not sure if it is just me or the griddle but we are not a match, I will stick with my pampered chef pans."
5,Up The Irons!,"Much like AC/DC, Iron Maiden have always been a band who, when playing live, deliever an over-the top performance. From the adrenaline-pumping ""Aces High"", to the mighty ""Trooper"", to the powerful ""Phantom Of The Opera"", this is an album that no Maiden fan should be without. Not one song here is disappointing, and sevral of them are brought to new life here. One of them, especially, ""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner"". This song was unbelievably great before, but played live, it seems even better!Not only do you get great songs here, but you get three full music videos, and a small exceprt of one. (the videos: 2 Minutes To Midnight, Powerslave, Aces High, the excerpt: Revelations.)So, to sum up this album in one word, i'd have to say this: ""AWSOME!"" This is one that you'll be glad you purchased."
4,A very good live album,"Iron Maiden cuts loose with some of their staples - like ""Run to the Hills"" and ""Number of the Beast"" - but also showcases some of the tracks you don't always hear, like ""Flight of Icarus"" and ""22 Acacia Avenue."" The album is very solid throughout, and even its weak points are pretty darn good. I would have liked to see a little more vocal energy on a few of the tracks - Bruce Dickinson really can own the songs sometimes, and when he doesn't you can really tell. That's not to say he's not good on those tracks, but when he goes all out they are exceptional. Still, this album is a must for all Maiden fans, with the definitive cut of ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" and some other essential tracks."
5,Maiden's Best Live Album By Far,"Two words best describes what we have here, Their Best!!!!This live offering has everything a Maiden fan could want, power, passion and pain along with the glory of the band flying high on the road following the massive success of the Powerslave release. This release contains old school Maiden and the song selection is top notch. I actually saw this tour back in 85 and I have fond memories (from what I can remember!) of this show. From the get go it storms out all guns blazing and never looks back. Everybody's in fine form and it shows up here with an energy that just oozes out of your speakers.Yup it's all here and it's all good.I love it!!"
5,Why Don't you own this already?,If you like metal at all buy this album. It contains the cream of the band's first five albums. The line up for this tour I beleive to be the strongest for Iron Maiden. I could break each song down but they prefer you use less than a thousand words. The performances on this double cd are flawless. You get excerpts from two nights at Long Beach areana and a few songs from Donnington. This is pure greatness in my opinion. It could well be the best live album of all time in my book. Listen to the samples if you have any doubt. I have bought this album many times on all three major forms of media(I just worn them out). This reissue is better than the innitial release because you get all the songs that were on the record set instead of one condensed cd that was originally released in the 80's. Up the Irons!
2,Maiden is Overrated,"Iron Maiden is loved by metal heads growing up in the 80s, in almost the same way that Sabbath was loved by metal heads growing up in the 70s. But at least Sabbath didn't completely rip off any band before them the way Maiden does. The Maiden boys obviously listened to every Uriah Heep and Deep Purple album released in the 70s. (Listen to Uriah Heep's DEMON AND WIZARDS and MAGICIAN'S BIRTHDAY, both of which came out a good 10 years before Maiden made it.) And this live album cannot live up to Deep Purple's MADE IN JAPAN. Do yourself a favor, and skip this for Heep and Purple, both of who did it earlier and better."
5,Maiden At Their Peak,"Of the 15 or so live albums I own, Live After Death stands alone at the top. Awesome energy, great song selection, and all-around sterling production. Highlights are too many to mention, though the crowd screaming on ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" still gives me chills. This was Maiden on top of their game, when they were the biggest metal band on Earth (Sorry, Priest fans).As many fans know, the band went slightly more progressive after this, and later stagnated to the point of being more or less inconsequential, losing Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson along the way. As a general metal fan, though, this album qualifies as a landmark in the genre's development."
4,"Good, but can't beat the studio recordings","Every song on this record is by all means amazing, but I give it 4 stars because I like the studio versions better."
3,Not what i expected...,i was expecting a 2 disc Live after death CD with all the songs! I only recieved a single disc set with 12 tracks instead of the advertised 17.... :(
3,not what I expected,"This CD was miscateogized as a double disc, but it was sent to me as a single disc. I guess it was due to confsion between the third party seller, and amazon itself. The problem was quickly solved. I recommend to everyone to e mail any seller to make sure you are getting what is advetised due to the fact that some sellers don't know about colletors items. Overall my dispte was settled right away and this seller was totally cool about it."
5,MASTERPIECE,"As live albums go there are few better than this, by any band. Live after Death is undoubtedly the best live maiden album. The whole album is dramatic and intense. The album opens with Churchills famous war speech and launches into a brilliant rendition of Aces High. Ripping live solos and bass lines make many of these maiden songs far superior to the studio versions -songs such as Hallowed be thy name - a live classic and even the flight of icarus - a song i wasnt hugely keen on wen i heard it on piece of mind, sound passionate and intense on this album.One gripe with this album is Bruce Dickinsons versions of Di'annos songs - and also a slightly disapointing version of the trooper. other than that a true masterpiece"
3,Unknown??,Ordered this product. But was so mad about how I complained and received a refund that I did not give it a chance. Please would someone review this cd and give it proper credit!! I do not even know were my copy went to.Yea!! Yea!!Ken
3,"Brand New Heavies, The - Close To You","CLOSE TO YOU is fun, party-time funk from the Brand New Heavies, buoyed in no small part by N'Dea Davenport's powerful vocals. Masters at Work deliver a serviceable house version, though the instrumental version loses a bit when it's stripped of Davenport's contribution."
1,Does NOT Work on Intel Macs!,"The iShock II WILL NOT work on Intel Macs, and per Macally' website, they have no intention of releasing an Intel- compatible driver for the iShock II. Don't waste your time on his product like I did."
1,No driver for Leopard (OS X 10.5.x),The driver crashes in Leopard. I had to use USB Overdrive($20 shareware) to even use the device. Mechanically it is well made and has a nice feel in the hands. Too bad the software support is nonexistant.
1,Not on my new Mac!,"This DID NOT WORK on my shiny new Mac. I got 2. I guess that makes me twice as stupid. Macally told me they'd keep me posted if they ever produce what I thought I already had paid for. I guess thats their version of customer service. I'll keep them posted how I feel about that by giving their products 1 star ratings. It's good we can stay in touch with each other, isn't it?"
1,MacAlly iShock II. in desperate need of update,"First one arrived incorrectly assembled. Amazon was fantastic in getting a replacement unit to me in record time. After receiving the second unit, the drivers were terribly outdated and the device would only work properly on a few games. Was very frustrating while trying to use the iShock on X-Plane. Was marginal on Modern Combat Domination as I could only use part of the controls, couldn't aim up or down, only left and right. Ended up using the X-box 360 controller with the free driver online and has worked flawlessly. I would not recommend the Macally iShock but would definitely recommend purchasing through Amazon"
4,Nice controller but compatibility issues,"I bought two of these, actually, for two different Macs in an attempt to run Zuma with them. They're really nice controllers, they feel great and there are quite a few buttons for different functions. Yet finding configurable drivers for them was a pain. We tried GamePad Companion but it made the device jerky and uncontrollable, especially when shooting.It's too bad someone can't make one that is easy to configure for the Mac users who actually enjoy gaming."
3,very good film,christian slater looked damn fine in this movie. The plot was a bit thin but although not one of slaters strongest roles he did make his character come to life in this tale. If you haven't seen this film do as it is a easy story to follow. Have fun.
4,"not bad , still good","i really liked this movie. some greayt sceanes especilly the jail sceane with slater.I also must ask, why did the veiwer from USA send it three times?"
4,Nothing more than mindless action entertainment,Hard Rain is nothing but mindless action entertainment. The film never takes its self really serious which is cool. Morgan Freemen and Christan Slater pretty much give paper thin performances but once again the film is full of action sequences and lots of good special effects. If you want to waste a rainy day then check out Hard Rain.
5,Awesome adventure with a twist,"This movie is a good action/thriller with nice cinematography and a plot that keeps you guessing until the end. The ending is a bit cut off but I liked it all the same. And if you enjoyed this movie, check out Broken Arrow with Christian Slater."
4,hard rain delivers,i saw hard rain being advertised because it was on usa one tuesday night so i decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did. the movie was very good. i liked the part in the high school when they were on those motorcycles or whatever they were on going through the school. i have been trying to buy this movie for a long time but i can't track it down. don't listen to the critics they don't know how to have any fun. check out hard rain. i don't want to go in to the plot. i want to surprise you. rated r for some violence.
3,GREAT ACTION,"I DO NOT CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS, THE PLOT AND LANGUAGE MAY NOT BE UP TO PAR, BUT THE ACTION WAS ENOUGH FOR ME. HARD RAIN IS A MOVIE I MAY LOOK AT FIVE TIMES THROUGH OUT THE WINTER. IT'S SOOOO! LONG AND INTERESTING THAT IT FILLS THOSE WINTER BLAHS. I LOVE ALL THAT WATER."
4,Hard Rain,"Morgan Freeman (later stars in ""Lean on Me""), Christian Slater (Kuffs), Randy Quaid (Independence Day), and Minnie Driver star in a suspenseful adventure FLOODED with awesome scenes. When a small Indiana town is covered by an on-going flood, a cop (Slater) faces a clan of money-seeking thiefs led by a man named Jim (Freeman), and a local sherriff gone mad (Quaid). Fighting not only the force of nature but two different teams of villains, Jack (Slater) joins forces with a town civilian (Driver) and attempts to escape the flood AND the unmerciful extortionists."
3,a wet ride,begins good put the end with Quaid is sorta a letdown but all throughtout its a hell of a ride with Slater running back and forth being chased by Freeman and his 3 henchmen after his uncle got killed(Edward Asner) and then he has to deal with Driver's safety and then Quaid and his pals and they all want the same thing. the bags full of money. the flood sequences are the best with all the rising water and the fires and the gunplay. Solomon directs a nice flood thriller.
1,Bad Movie,I am sorry but this movie was terrible. I would give it no stars if i could but i had to give it one.
1,Some good action but otherwise,"The movie could of been alot better,Imean the action was great but it didn't have a story line at all.The movie was also filled with bad diolog,and the performances werint that great ether.I wondered why they would be delivering money when there gonna have a town flood.I did not like the begining at all,you think that a bank is being robbed but theen you find out that there just getting the monet to deiver it.Why?I also did not like morgan freemens charecter because he was to nice to people when he's really a criminall.people like that are really mean and not so nice to people.some of the action is good at the end but at some parts with the bad diolog and stupid charecters doesn't make some of the action as good ether.And for that I give it one star."
1,a real dog,"This movie is so bad, I didn't even watch it all. It's like watching a bad made-for-TV movie. There is a lot of water and that makes it interesting to look at, but the story is lame and noone acts like they are real people at all. It's like they are reading the script as they go and even the actors must think it's stupid, because they don't seem like they care. As I watched, I guessed that someone in Hollywood heard about a town that would be completely flooded, so they went there and made a movie without any time to write a story. It feels like they sat around for 20 minutes, thought of something to do for the next scene and shot it with one take. Really embarrassing for such well-known actors. What were they thinking!? Skip it and be glad you did."
1,Poor Service,I ordered the product and an empty box was received and verified by the Post Office. I notified Amazon and they never responded.
1,"Critics of critics,step off","For those who continue to bash other reviewers for giving their opinions of movies here,please get a life. They are entitled to post reviews,just as you are.This is standard D grade hollywood action fare,about as contrived and stupid as it gets. The acting isn't really an issue,here,it's the braindead plot and script,which frequently makes no sense. The special effects aren't really impressive,either,since much of the film looks as if it was filmed in a bathtub.By the way,it seems in vogue amongst Amazon browsers to excuse and apologize for any mediocre and brainless flick by stating 'lighten up,it's an action movie!',or 'it's a comedy!'. I suppose any dreck ever vomited upon the landscape can be immune to criticism under these terms. That said,if you really,really,really,really liked 'Con Air',and you're in the mood for something less weighty,this little film is for you!"
2,Review of Hard Rain,"Poor quality copy of original movie. Additionally, quite pixilated in transmission through ROKU. Not the case with other Amazon movies we have rented.Thanks for the opportunity to comment !"
3,Suspenseful and well-done. Exciting and worth watching.,"Suspenseful and well-done. Exciting and worth watching.Good casting, good effects, not a dull moment.(why do they force me to pad my review to 20 mins?)"
4,"Great Looking, Flimsy Construction","I have been researching garden arbors for about a month now and was really excited to see this one...Once assembled, the arbor is beautiful and smells wonderful...good quality cedar. The bad news is that it arrives unassembled (obviously) and is shoddily constructed using STAPLES. Unfortunately, in shipping, the arbor was actually broken in 4 places. Fortunately, my husband is an excellent carpenter and they do include wood glue with the screws used to put it together. We patched it up, then took about 2 hours to put it together, and added an additional 4 screws for extra support. That night we had a massive, unexpected storm and we expected to see the arbor strewn about the yard. It had been blown over, but was in one piece.Overall, I do recommend this item if you are handy with wood and don't mind spending a little extra time putting it together. It is a great, expensive looking piece when completed."
4,Wrong Song Listing,"Like so many others, I bought this cd for the song, ""Something In The Air."" When, I got it and listened to it a few times, I noticed that at least some of the other songs weren't half bad and that the overall album is actually pretty good. However, I always noticed that there seemed to be a problem and I decided to count the minutes on the original album to see what was the a-side and what was the b-side, and I think most will find that on this cd, it just doesn't make mathematical sense. So, I went looking across the internet and found that the original album on vinyl actually had the song, ""Something In The Air,"" at the end of the album instead of the beginning, which does make mathematical sense. So, I just thought that some of you out there might be wondering the same thing and this is the truth of the album.P.S. - The album sounds somewhat better with the correct order."
4,Sums Up The Piece Movement,"For me the song something in the air is one of my all time favourites. If your a fan of the summer of love then this album is a must, and no I'm not writing for amazon to sell the product."
4,Remastered?,"If this is a remaster, it's not a very good job. Very little improvement.Playing it back to back against the 1991 domestic cd, the domestic original sounds almost as good.On the other hand, the domestic version is pretty hard to find in good condition, so if you don't have this... Get it any way you can!"
3,Fun but ephemeral,"This is a great toy - fun for dog and owner. The designers definitely have a great sense of humor. But, unfortunately, the suspicious chicken does not hold up. My dog (not a particularly vicious chewer) tore off the nose in the first week."
4,Suspicous Chicken Dogs Best Friend,"Our Swissy who is big into suckling stuffed animals has found this chicken to be the best for this such thing. He used to love the ducks from farm and fleet but they fall apart too fast. He does wear these out after a few months of sucking. We cut off the tag and the felt thing on the chicken's head right away. As long as you don't play tug-of-war they last a good long time. I have to buy 2 at a time. I give it four stars because I have to alter it before I give it to the dog to chew. Atreyu has the fish, snake, alligator, and frog. He loves the chicken the best."
5,Our dog loved it!,"We have a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who tears her way through toys like this in a matter of minutes. The chicken has made it through about 2 months of use (we rotate her toys, so we've had it considerably longer) and to date, only needed minor stomach surgery to close up a seam. Nothing is funnier than watching our dog charge around the living shaking the living heck of this thing! She LOVES it!!!"
2,Wings came of rather quickly,We got the smaller cat version of this and it's still going after over a year. This stupid thing was HUGE and the wings tore off in about a week. Get the cat.
2,Torn in 10 minutes,"puppy tore open a wing, destroyed the red felt and orange hanger/hook on head...not too impressive. $4 CVS squeaker toy lasted longer. Also, very faint, difficult to engage squeaker."
2,Not worth the money,"My child LOVED the car, but it is not durable at all. Remote works part-time, at best. We have other remote cars in the house and they all work much better than this one. We took the first one back, thinking we got a bad model, but the second one was the same, if not worse. We are taking the second one back to buy a completely different car."
1,J-U-N-K,"This is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. The antenna was broken when we took it out of the box, both doors feel off, and then you had to find a screwdriver versitile enough to put the batteries on the inside of the car. I was at the store the morning after Christmas getting my money back. This certainly wasn't worth the hype."
2,Very disappointing for Belva Plain,"I have recently rediscovered Belva Plain and have been avidly reading her books. I have read about six in the past three months and found each of them, while not ""can't put it down, stay up all night"", thoroughly enjoyable and readable. Then I started on ""Secrecy"" and was totally disappointed. The plot, the characters, the ending...just didn't seem like the same author I had enjoyed so much. Won't stop me from continuing to read this author, but hope I don't run into any more like this one."
2,Something has gone awry with Belva Plain!!!,"I have always thought that Belva Plain wrote good,old-fashioned stories---nothing that would tax yourbrain or make you stay up at night, but interestingreads. This book's language is stilted and so areall of the main characters. I am very disappointed.I would not recommend buying this book. I know it ison The Times bestseller list, but I don't know why.Perhaps that is why it is titled ""Secrecy."""
4,Just a good story.,"""Secrecy"" tells the story of Charlotte and her family, and an irreversible act of betrayal that nearly tears them apart. Charlotte's feelings are very real for the reader, and this is quite a page-turner. The only flaw here is Plain's affinity for too-happy endings. Still, it is a must-read for fans of Plain."
2,A disappointment,"Belva Plain novels are no great literary shakes but usually entertaining enough to take to the beach. With this one, the plot angst laid on with the usual trowel doesn't make up for the consistently lousy writing. It's bad. Really Bad. Hard to believe an editor ever got near the manuscript. That it made the best seller list, is one answer to the question: What's in a name?Washington reader"
4,Plain is still a great storyteller,Plain is still a great storyteller. The story is not that page-turner but it's worth the while. She has a way of defining emotions whether it's deep or shallow.
4,The Danger of Secrets,This book revolved around the secrets of a family. Each person's secret affected everyone. It was an enjoyable book to read and was pleased with the ending.
4,Liked this book,I was very satisfied with my purchase. This is a great series and this book is interesting. I would recommend this to any of Francine Rivers fans.
3,A look at the man from the bible...,"The second book of the sons of encouragement series was just okay. It was nothing special.The story was interesting but not engaging. I could put the book down and not return to it.But I love how the author words herself so I continued reading on. I don't know how much truth it was in the book. But a few of the same facts were used from the first book that did not make me question how accurate they were. That helped me separate fiction from facts.The best way to understand things from the bible, I would recommend to start with the first book of the series.After reading the first and second book of the sons of encouragement series, I can say with confidence that Lineage of Grace series about the women from the bible were better reads except for the last book of that series, ""MARY"" which was preposterous. The author carried too much with fantasy of her own about the most important woman of the bible."
5,Great affirmation for following our Lord,"I just finished this book and have read all 5 in the Women in the Linage of Jesus series and Aaron from this series. I thought this one was great--bringing home the truth that God wanted to reward our faithfulness, but the way is not easy. Trust in the Lord is required even when we don't understand and the decisions are not popular. I was a little confused about where Rahab fits in by this book, but it was probably my faulty memory. Rivers does her research."
2,A disappointment,"I am an avid reader of Francine Rivers books. She weaves a gripping story with powerful spiritual lessons. She is my favorite Christian novelist because her books have so much 'meat' to them unlike other Christian novelists whose books comes across as trivial.However I was disappointed with THE WARRIOR. The storytelling wasn't as tight and the story wasn't a pageturner. Usually I can't put one of her books down, but this one took me a while to read because it didn't compel me. The spiritual lesson wasn't as strong either.It was an okay read, but I know Francine can do better."
4,Love Francine Rivers!,"I love anything she writes, but these books add so much insight to what we already know about the characters from the Bible. The only thing I was dissappointed in was I ordered a paper back and received a hard cover."
2,"Same old, same old... You wish!","There is nothing to say against Ludlum's storylines. The same pattern, however he always manages to turn it into something exciting and unpredictable. Not so this time. Taking off to a great start, he is painting the picture of a great Hungarian philantropist, who resembles the real life, well known financial tycoon G. S.From there on however, any seasoned thriller reader can easily predict the turn of events. Even more, the writing is sloppy, commercial, and unmotivated. Where Ludlum used to paint a picture for all of his characters, making them unpredictable, he does only the minimum necessary to fulfil his page quota. His hero's picture is more ellaborate, but one would imagine, that R.L. can come up with some new character profiles.Why do I give two stars? Well, I have seen worse than this: The Covert-One series."
2,Certainly Not Ludlum,"I really wonder how many people who've been writing reviews about The Janson Directive have read any other Ludlum books. This is not vintage Ludlum. It was certainly not written by him. First, the dialogue is too fresh, and that points to a younger writer. Secondly, after around page 200 or so, after the plane blows up, the story goes downhill. Up to 200, it may have been Ludlum. But after that it just goes down. The suspense of the book died then, replaced by action, too much detail on the technology of the guns or cars being driven, and the angles each shot came from. After the plane exploded, there was only one twist, at the end, that just about anyone could have seen coming. From any other author, this would be a four or a five, but if you put the name Robert Ludlum on a book, I'm expecting something better."
3,Just off the mark!,Being a fan Lublum I felt this book was just a little too long as well as over the top unbelievable. How many times can Janson possibly escape instances where only one or two people in the world can? The twist and turns were interesting but like I stated just a little too long with the fininshed product.
3,Good but not great,"The story was very creative and unique like most of Ludlum's novels. The action sequences were really good but the reason this didn't at least get a four-star was the exhaustive descriptions. They frequently took away from the pace of the story. During an intense action sequence, there is no need for excessive details. This was a great story that could have been reduced in number of pages."
4,good thriller,"this was an excellent thriller, page turner, can't wait for the next one. That is all for now. Kony 2012!"
2,A new James Bond knock-off,"Very disappointing after some of the fine work Ludlum has done. It reads like a poor James Bond with the hero able to always succeed at every impossible task and unbelievable bad guys who always screw up. The Bond girl kills the pilot and machine gunner in a helocopter with two rifle shots while driving a speedboat at top speed on Chesapeake Bay, for example. It's more like a parody of Ludlum."
3,"An average thriller....nothing more, nothing less.....","Typical Ludlum....steroetype characters, expected unexpectedness, predictable unpredictability. Still a good fun read if you don't feel the need to think too hard.There is a directly plagiarized line from the movie Pulp Fiction which just sounds incredibly out of place. It involves a pair of pliers and a blowtorch!There are fewer ""Dan Brown"" type narrative errors than in most thrillers of this size, although a Corvette's bodywork is described as being made of steel at one point. Really?It would make a good movie. I think that was the idea when it was written."
3,Just Like Today's Headlines,"Just when you think you know who the villian is, it becomes apparent that you've gotten yourself involved with an international yak milk smuggling ring. But wait, are they really interested in yak milk or is that just a front for their true aim: weasel rustling? Or even weasel wrestling?Ludlum is truly fiendish. Even the dullest parts of the book can cause you to scream --- if you sit on a hot stove while reading it, or if you set fire to the book.Hmmm, perhaps I'll read this sometime."
5,"Vintage Ludlum, with a touch of ""Ghost""","I highly recommend this book without any reservations! Having read or listened to most of the books he had written, this book is in the top tier. It is a good believable read and the protaganist is well thought out. The hero, if you will, is Paul Janson, a less than perfect human being, just like the rest of us. He has a lot of unresolved issues about his past, Vietnam and his government work. Another scarred survivor of the Vietnam War who was good at what he did, almost too good for his own liking. The story moves along very well and has very believable, well developed characters. Ludlum is one of my favorite adventure writers, and I have listened to this book twice this year. If you like a good adventure yarn with ironic twists and turns throughout the story, you would do well to read or listen to this book."
4,An enhanced Ludlum,"Whoever wrote this has done a good job. I was a bit concerned at first that it was almost a 'by the numbers' Ludlum story: Intelligence expert/ everyone trying to kill him / a secret organisation / everyone he talks to gets killed and so on. At one stage the lead character breaks into a secret HQ set in the middle of no-where and I thought I was re-reading an old book by mistake, but....There are enough tweaks and diversions to retain the Ludlum tradition but also bring in some new elements and the writing is good and the story works well.There was also a message in here about how much of the world regards America which I thought was handled in an interesting and thought provoking way.Enjoyable."
2,Convoluted and Implausable,"I received this book as a Christmas gift and was surprised to see it as I remembered that the author had died a year or so ago.Whether this was a completed and unpublished transcript or a partially completed transcript that was finished by an unnamed ghost is irrelevant. I found the story line very implausable, unnecessarily convoluted and confusing. Those that are Ludlum fans may enjoy it as a last hurrah, I suppose, but I was glad to finish it so that I could start a more enjoyable book."
2,The Janson Directive,"Too many pages of what I believe to be unnecessary discriptions which do not keep the story plot ongoing or have any relation to the expected action of Janson. Sorry, Mr. Ludlum"
2,a hollywood script in prose form,"the good: the action is frequent and fun. The book, overall, doesn't bog down too much. It's not overly verbosethe bad: as others pointed out, the characters are VERY 'cookie cutter', even the situations and environmenst the characters are put in are cookie cutter.The lead character , Janson is like James Bond + Jason Bourne with an identity crisis. I almost think that this story would have been better served as a plot for a Splinter Cell game, though Sam Fisher is more interesting than Janson.So is it worth it? Well, yes if you want a low maintenance read to pass the time, perhaps on a beach or airplane.But as I said, it's almost as if the book was written in the hopes of making a screenplay out of it. The cookie cutter characters that hollywood loves to put in its movies are ripe for the taking in this one."
5,Fast paced,Good storyline. Likable characters. Lots of plot twists. This was a fun read and it's hard to put down one you start.
2,Brain-Dead Beach Reading,"If Ludlum is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this one on the plane, train or beach. Only my second read of this author, and I know now that watching movies with Matt Damon chase around amid high technology is a better investment. This plot plods along with a protagonist/antagonist plotline. Our hero Paul Jansen,an ex-elite Navy SEAL carrying psychological baggage from Vietnam, is hired by a mysterious organization to save an enigma -- world philanthropist Peter Novak from the clutches of evil. But who is Peter Novak? And who is pulling the strings? And how will the world be affected?It doesn't matter, the reader keeps turning pages to get to the resolution. Assassins galore, a sexy sniper, MacGyver-like techno-brilliance, impenetrable fortresses, Jihad promoters, torture chambers, in short all the accoutrements of classic spy versus spy are here. Enjoy it, Ludlum fans."
3,To much filler,"This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and probably not my last. I liked the characters Paul Janson and Jessica Kincaid and I hope there are more stories on their exciting lives. The rating of three that I gave this is all for the story line, action and suspense. I found myself skim reading a lot especially in the middle when Ludlum put to much description of the surroundings in as filler; this really slowed the action for awhile. This story really picks up at the end though with a lot of action and excitment.If you like international intrique and world politics mixed with spies and terrorists,you'll like this one."
2,Why is everybody chasing me? Again.,"20 odd years ago, when all I was reading was SCI-FI and fantasy, my mom insisted I read Ludlum's Bourne Identity. I remember really enjoying it and read several others of his through the years. Looked forward to and enjoyed the movies, but alas the Janson Directive, while fasted paced, offered me nothing new. Maybe it was the two recent movies with the agency's secret program always chasing someone, maybe those intervening 20 odd years of thrillers, suspense and techno thrillers made me an informed consumer.... Close but no cigar. Too many expected and predictable almost caught `yas / barely get-a-ways / one-ups-manships between the master vs. the disciple. I think today's readers have seen more than their fair share of someone being tracked by their best pupil or for that mater dusting off some ancient Obi-won to dispatch their star gone rogue to enjoy this book."
4,The Janson Directive,"I have read many books by this auther in years passed. When I bought my Kindle Fire, I was surprised when I found this book on Aomazon.com. It was hard to put down. I highly recomend this book. I will be looking for more books to down load to my Kindle Fire"
4,The Janson Directive By Robert Ludlum,"For anyone who Enjoys International intrigue, some violence, action packed with a fairly complex plot and a good pace so you stay interested, this book will fit all that criteria, as will any of Robert Ludlum's Books. More people will be familiar with the Jason Bourne series as several have been made into movies."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this dvd. The editing was horrible as in there wasn't any. Branch doesn't talk so the viewer is left to simply watch him workout. He doesn't explain his routines or his training methods. His training partner is reckless and dangerous, and he would be banned at most gyms.The second dvd shows Branch at home, and he does speak, but we still don't learn anything about him or his training. This dvd might have been acceptable 10 or 15 years-ago, but not today, especially when Phil Heath and Kai Green have exceptional videos out there. Even Shawn Ray's ""The Final Countdown"" is a much better buy than ""Raw Reality."" Save your money and pass on this one."
2,bodybuilding,"In watching this dvd, I found myself put off by how these guys showed no respect for the weights & the gym itself. Tossing the plates around like rubbish. I know if these guys were at any of the hardcore gyms in Sydney,Australia, Like ex-wrestlers Paul Graham or Billy Moore's Gym's they'd have been neck cranked & thrown out of their weight rooms pretty bloody quick.I've seen Arnold work out. He'd put the weights away for the simple respect of any other gym member to use & wipe down the bench with his towel so as not to leave his sweat behind.Now Branch is a strongman, no doubt. Everything else about this dvd was good but boys. put your TOYS away neatly so the other kids can play with them okay?"
4,get in on the cult....,"AS a movie, it was just OK,,,, but there are some really great lines in it...and it does have a huge cult following.."
4,Ridiculous... In A Good Way,"This movie is completely ridiculous, but in a good way.My boyfriend was watching it while I was playing on the computer, but it was so entertaining that I ended up turning my game off and watching it.I definitely would consider this movie a win for the Coen Bros. You get the same intelligent humor that appears in Fargo, without the dark plot. Definitely an ecclectic cast that fits together nicely."
4,Bigger Than Big,"With his portrayal of Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski in the Coen brothers psycho romp The Big Lebowski, Jeff Bridges has attained the rank of acting god. He's been cult (see Lebowski or American Heart), mainstream (The Fisher King or The Mirror has Two Streisands-eek!), but as an aging stoner caught up in world peopled by those even weirder than he is, Bridges has reached a sort of character nirvana. How can you not just love the guy?The brilliant Coens again display a kaleidoscopic range of genres, themes, techniques, and plot lines. Lebowski's a wonder to behold. Here, the bleakness of Fargo is replaced with a dazzling colorwheel showcased particularly in The Dude's hilarious dreams. If there's a point to this whole affair, I missed it. And I couldn't care less."
4,Comedy Noir,"This was the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, so I was not attuned to the fine points of the re-release ""Collector's Edition"". I just enjoyed the creative Coen brothers masterpiece of characters and vibrant yet dark and twisted plot. The Big Lebowski is just a fantastic engaging steady stream of laughs.Jeff Bridges (the ""Dude"" Lebowski), John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Julianne Moore are the stars and unforgetable as they go on a journey of mistaken identity, White Russians, kidnapping, bowling championships, and the Los Angeles underworld.The Big Lewbowski is a hilarious comedy noir full of colorful bizarre characters."
5,Quirky-but if you like Coen brothers movies,"you'll love this one. It did not have the box office taht other Coen brothers films did on release-but it became a cult legend. For good reason. Wonderful performances by Bridges, Goodman, Moore, Hoffman, etc. Brilliant script and cinematography-with nods to film classics."
3,OK...not great,I'm a fan of Coen bros. Lebowski definitely has Coen-esque quirky (and hilarious) characters and all actors did a great job. The downside was that the plot labored in places--not nearly as tight as other works by Coens. The hype I heard/read before seeing the movie might have set my expectations too high. Check it out and decide for yourself.
1,This Product Was Discovered Broken And Ruined Christmas Morning,"Being the only thing my son asked for this year, he was so excited on Christmas morning when he unwrapped it. When he removed it from the packaging, the display bowling ball was broken. He was extremely disappointed. To make matters worse, the return policy for this product is refund only so I am going to have to send it back and then reorder. Do not order this product from Amazon. Find it someplace else where greater care is taken with product shipping and the return policy is better."
5,Nice packaging,"DVD was a gift for my step dad, he loved it! Attractive, new packaging was also a plus. DVD plays perfectly."
4,"Brilliant, smooth and relaxing movie","I love to watch The Big Lebowski over and over again. That's so relaxing. You just listen to the confusing story and get mixed up a little bit, but that doesn't matter : you laugh at the characters, enjoy their brilliant play (of course, especially Goodman) and admire the authenticity of the film itself.I would recommend it to everyone who is not in the mood for trying to understand the moral of this movie. There is a very simple reason for that : there is no moral...Oops... the star I scratched down, well, it's because The Big Lebowski is a little longer than it should be.I'll have a white russian, please."
2,BD is garbage,"Universal took an old outdated HD transfer (same as released on HD-DVD) which had already issues and then applied generous doses of digital grain removal and some digital sharpening to it and fiddled with the colors and contrast till it ""popped"". And there is your remastered version that looks nothing like the original film it came from. Poor release, poor policy. To see how it's done properly check out the new Cohen Brothers Blu Rays for ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Miller's Crossing"". Why do these look much better, more detailed and like film with a texture of grain? Because they are new transfers made on modern equipment and unnecessary and destructive digital tinkering was abstained from.Universal has probably the poorest record of all major studios when it comes to catalogue titles. And Lebowski is another victim of this cost cutting strategy (no new transfers, recycle and overprocess old ones instead)."
5,LA Bum's Journey Out of Obscurity,"This is a fabulous film, one that I had rented so many times it was starting to look far more economical to purchase it!Jeff Labowski's rug is compromised by a thug who mistakens Jeff for a millionaire he is trying to squeeze some money out of. Jeff ""The Dude"" sets out on what should be a very simple mission for compensation of his rug. This is when things go awry.The Dude becomes involved in a kidnapping rescue mission, meeting ponographer's, a police chief, a child molester, a feminist artist and a teenage runaway on his quest to replce his beloved rug. It really tied the room together, you see.If you haven't already, you must see this film."
3,Not blu ray quality!,"Just got this for Xmas, love the film, but this is definitely not high resolution! If I had bought it I'd be returning it."
4,Classic Coen brothers,"Not their very best work- try ""Fargo"" for that- but if you like the Coen brothers' films, you'll like this one, too."
3,"Excellent Film, Terrible Packaging","The Big Lebowski is by FAR my favorite film. It is the brainchild of the brilliant Coen Brothers who also brought the world ""Fargo"" and ""No Country.."". This, however, is not a fitting tribute to the tenth anniversary of the film. The ""bowling ball"" display piece is made of cheap plastic and does not close properly. Even the DVD's came scratched, something that is unacceptable for this price and product.But that's just like my opinion, man,,,"
4,He's a nihilist....That must be exhausting,"I consider this to be the perfect type of movie to own, because, unlike most movies, it gets better with multiple viewings. It is, first of all, very funny, and it's tough to catch all the jokes on the first viewing. Secondly, the plot is fairly complex and possibly difficult to follow in the first viewing. Still, this movie is entertaining mostly due to the humor and characters, not the plot. It is not a profound movie, and I wouldn't look deep to find any messages it might convey. It is just very funny, with countless memorable lines. The only thing I didn't like was the cowboy narrator. I thought his dialogue at the end about the significance of ""The Dude"" was unnecessary and a bit forced."
4,Excellent!,I _really_ enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it. It has extremely likeable characters and a very perculiar plotline (Which I usually enjoy.) The only reason I had to give it 4/5 stars was because I simply didn't enjoy myself all that much on second wieving. But it is still a brilliant movie.
1,Worst film I have seen,"Without wishing to upset the others who have given this film glowing reviews, I must say that this film has to be the worst I have ever seen. Its' wafer thin story line , which also had holes a jet could fly through, was so bad I had to resist ejecting the DVD. I only watched all of it so I could give it a balanced review and maybe see if it had a scrap of worthy dialog or even one small piece of humour that wasn't contrived or derivative ( the urn ash all over the Dude, really ). All in all a waste of money. The opposite of funny."
1,If your High You still may not like this,"A burn out stumbles around doing meaningless crap. His friends, practically undeveloped characters, assist. THe worst move Bridges has ever done. THis has a cult following based on some decen quotes but other than that only a long term pot head could appreciate this. One star, stick of gum."
1,I Don't Get it (AT ALL),"A friend of mine recently bought this DVD. He assured me I would like it. I had my doubts from reading the DVD jacket but said okay. Curious, as I'd explained to him numerous times what sorts of films or themes I like, and don't. And every I ""don't"" is amazingly encapsuled in this--uh--film--if one can call it that.So we watched the DVD. I gave it about twenty minutes--to be polite--though after about three of them I knew I hadn't the slightest idea in the world what the hell this--thing--was about. Here's a bunch of guys who they seem to think are 'with it' I suppose. The dialogue is essentially one raunchy joke followed by another cheesy joke, with a ""f"" bomb about every four seconds. The twenty minutes seemed like 20,000 years in Sing Sing, as the book goes.Apparently most people love this movie. I'd like to see a breakdown of the demographics."
1,The Big Disappointment,"What are you people who rave about this movie smoking. It simply stunk, and I wasted a buck to rent it (not to mention an hour before I fell asleep). My wife now refuses to let me rent anything. (My last selection was Son of Rambow, so you see why). What the hell - not funny, no plot, and who wants to watch an ugly guy walk around in boxers and an ugly bathroom. Whoever gave this more than 1 star (I wish I could have given it 0) is an idiot! The Coen Brothers have done some good work - Fargo and Old Men, but this one was a dud."
2,Turned it off,Felt Jeff B was playing himself and shut it down for lack of real laughs. Have difficulty understanding how it got 4.5 stars. I've enjoyed many Jeff B movies better than this one.
2,Not my brand of humor,"I suspect that there is a sub-culture that would find it hilarious, but too many of the jokes went over my head."
3,the Big Lebowski movie,"The Big Lebowski is a big loser as far as I'm concerned...it has its funny parts but for the most part, it's a waste of time."
1,What a let down!,"Having loved Barton Fink, I was looking forward to something amazing! I didn't get it! I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about! But then, we can't all like the same thing. I gave it one star for Jeff Bridges. Usual his presence would guarantee at least a 2 star rating, but he wasn't exactly lust material in this."
1,Don't Bother,"Horrible? I like Jeff Bridges and expected a mature comedy. Unfortunately you would have to be between the ages of 15-23 to enjoy this movie. I knew I was in trouble when Lebowski said he goes by the name ""Dude"". I made it through about 2/3rds of the movie and then gave up and didn't finish it."
5,The Dude Abides,"As the end credits of ""The Big Lebowski"" rolled, I sat in my chair trying to contemplate what exactly I had just experienced. The Big Lebowski is...weird. It is also a hilarious and entertaining movie that no one-especially fans of the Coen brothers' films-should be without. There is tons of quotable dialogue such as ""You're entering a world of pain"", ""Donny, you're out of your element"" and ""Nobody f's with the Jesus"". The plot is a twisting parody of the film noir genre, with lovably eccentric characters and a healthy dose of offbeat humor. This classic cult film deserves better reviews than it got, and in my opinion, if you haven't yet watched it then you should be right now."
3,???,"I dont get why everyone loves this movie so much, it has some good moments but never really goes anywhere and it seems way too long (whether or not it is long doesnt matter, it felt like many many hours to me).Alos whats up with that irritating cowboy? He should of been cut."
5,"Excellent Performances, Dialogue, Cinematography","This is another masterful work from the Coen Brothers loosely in the style of their previous comedies. The characterizations are fantastic, and are magnificently portrayed by Turturo, Goodman, Bridges, and Buschemi. The camera work is also wonderful: take the scene that introduces Turturo in the bowling alley...fantastic application of both motion and cutaways.And of course, the dialogue is typically brilliant Coen. ""I'm the dude, so that's what you call me, you know? Uh, that or uh, his dudeness, or uh, duder, or uh, you know, el duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."""
5,Nuts,"This is the type of movie that you have to see over and over again to really appreciate. It gets so much funnier every time. Jeff Bridges is a complete loser living in Los Angeles who manages to get himself caught up in wheeling-and-dealings with the upper tier, and at the same time, never just takes everything that comes at him with hardly a flinch. The Coen Brothers manage to take the wierdest characters and situations and twist them around to make them very very funny."
5,S.T.F.U Donny,"this is what you would call your classic cult film.the first,oh say 2 or 3 times i saw it i thought it was 'aight'. every time after that it just got better.you honestly have to see it about 4 times before you realize what a gem it is and quite possibly won't ever get tired of seeing it after that.John Goodman is way,way funnier than i have ever seen him before and Jeff Bridges is..well,has Jeff Bridges ever starred in an entertaining movie besides this one?? This is a very special movie, but not to insult anyone,if you aren't an intelligent,quick-witted person you might not ever see it's charm"
5,"Mark it ZERO, Dude!","Coens' most visually creative film to date, this little opus has everything: cerebral writing, and remarkable filmography. Its' DVD is fabulous."
2,Makes 8MM look like The Godfather.,"Yeah, 8MM was a horrible movie. With that out of the way, let me say that The Big Lebowski was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. People are gonna write negative things about my review. Yeah, well, get over it or get a life. Either one. Fargo was so much more superior to this film (not to mention so many other films). I popped this into my VCR with such high hopes. Turns out I couldn't even watch the entire thing; it was about 3 in the afternoon and I didn't feel like napping. It's a movie about a guy who takes ransom money. It was a good idea, but presented in a sloppy, over-stylish fashion. The only reason I give it two stars is because of John Goodman's gun-toting character. Hehe. I guess it's worth a look if you liked the Coen's previous movies just to see that every master has their one failure. A drag, to say the least."
1,language ruined movie,"I saw this movie on tv, with all the language cut out, and thought it was very funny. Bought the movie from amazon. Was totally disgusted. The 'F' word was the most used word in the movie, practically every sentence. No reason for it, it didn't add a thing. I soon found myself disgusted and making unflattering comments in response to the characters lines. Gave it away. Should have burned it as the trash it is."
1,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR INSOMANIA,"This movie is Terrible. I am not sure which one stinks most, Murphys' ""Holy man"", this movie or ""Manhattan"" by Woody Allen. These kind of movies should be label ""sleeping movies"""
2,A disappointment,I can't for the life of me understand the almost 5 star rating for this DVD. I got about 20 minutes into this mess and stopped the movie. I like all the actors in it too. I guess it will make a good coaster. Sorry Coen Brothers.
2,Terrible,"This movie is raved about by so many people, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. It's terrible. Simply and plainly terrible. The characters are boring, the plot is simplistic, and there's far too much pointless profanity. Jeff Bridges' character is an idiot and a loser, and somehow we're supposed to identify with him and the trouble he gets himself into.Thinking back, I realize that most of the rave reviews I heard of this movie came in my college days, and not coincidentally, most people I knew back then were a lot like Bridges' character- losers, drug users, drop-outs, and drifters. The Coen Brothers are great film makers, but not here. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible film."
2,The Big Lebowski,"I had seen a short clip of the movie on a show devoted to Jeff Bridges and it looked like it would be a fun type film to see. However, I was disappointed. I'm not a prude, but the F word was used much too often and I felt it distracted from the story. I think that John Goodman did an excellent job in portraying a Viet Nam vet who cannot get Nam out of his mind. It permeates every situation he is involved in. Applauds to John G.!!!!"
1,"Like Totally Disappointing, Man !",This movie was very disappointing. After so many good reviews I thought it just had to be great. Just shows you you cant rely on public opinion ! The non-stop foul language didn't help either. I suppose the script writer was struggling to come up with words to fill out the incredibly inane script.
2,not,I Didn't like it - not my type of movie - kind of boring - I don't recommended it - fast forward helped.
5,Duderonomy,"The Dude is like a modern, much-cooler Jesus. The man lives in the crowded materialistic enclave of Los Angeles (hard ""g""), but he is completely above and beyond the petty striving of his neighbors. This is how the boddhisatva lives.The plot follows the Dude (Jeff Bridges) and his bowling buddies Walter Sobchek (John Goodman), a preposterous, bloated vet with anger issues, and blank Donny (Steve Buscemi). The plot is hilariously circuitous, following a pompous crippled fat cat, his manservant (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his porn star trophy wife (Tera Reid), the attempts to recover that wife and/or ransom money from a gang of nihilists, etc. Great surreal scenes when the Dude trips, cool soundtrack too."
3,interesting,"a strange movie..don't understand it, but oh well husband likes it and that's all that counts. I don't think I would recommend it to anyone else"
2,Achiever's Edition is a ripoff,"For years I've waited for _The Big Lebowski_ to get a proper DVD edition. When this Achiever's Edition was announced I was thrilled. When it arrived, I was underwhelmed. The sound and picture don't appear any better in this edition than the original DVD released 7 years ago. Also, the disc in the Achievers Edition is identical to the Collectors Edition also released at the same time. For $20, you get some lousy cardboard coasters, a chamois and some postcards.A huge disappointment, and a major disservice to one of the best movies of the 1990s."
5,I started league bowling because of this movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. It only gets funnier with every screening you see of it. The dialogue is superb and the comedic content is unbelievable. There are people who don't find this movie hilarious and do not think it is funny. They have a poor sense of humor. If you don't like it the first time, give it another try becuase this movie will payoff."
4,A cult classic!,You have to enjoy movies like Half-baked and the like to enjoy this flick. Definitely one that you will be quoting soon after watching.
3,Dude reigns,I loved the laid backness but not the f word. Of course Jeff is one of my favorite actors anyway. Reminds me of bowling when a kid.
2,"Jeff Bridges was good, but","This was one of the most boring films I've seen. Jeff Bridges was good as usual, but he had nothing to work with script-wise."
2,A Blu Ray with no subtitles?,"I own somewhere around 1200 movies. Almost half of those are Blu-Rays. This is the very first one I've ever purchased that didn't have subtitles. I see now that it doesn't list subtitles in the description but when you're already batting .1000 you don't think you need to any more. I always check with regular DVDs, but a blu-ray should have them, period.The movie itself isn't under review, it's this edition. The movie is great, the quality on this Blu-Ray is average, what you would expect, maybe just a little less than that I guess. The quality of the extras is a little boring, nothing exciting here and some info is just repeated exactly from other editions.-D"
3,Great Movie,"Not at all what was expected by being a first time watcher of this movie, but it was still a decent movie."
5,Great Cohen Brother film,"This is a great flick if you like off beat quirky comedies, especially Coen brother movies like ""Fargo"" or ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou"". This movie is probably not for the main streamers, but I loved it!"
5,heh heh...,"it's a movie that really isn't about anything...aimless like the dude's life, but funny as hell. The Coen Bros subtly subvert the action/kidnapping genre by setting you up to believe the movie actually has a plot, which seems plausible right up until the end...by the time you realize you've been duped you've watched the whole movie and enjoyed it despite yourself. OK, so I'm not making it sound very good...but it really is a lot of fun...."
5,Not Flawless,"Not flawless like Fargo, The Big Lebowski is great just for its originality. The quirky characters alone are worth seeing this movie for. Compared to 99% of Hollywood product, this film is fresh scene after scene. Unforgettable. The Dude rules!"
5,Brilliant,"This was an ingenius film starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and my favorite actor, Steve Buscemi. The movie was hilarious, and at the same time had a complex plot (something very unusual to see in comedy) It was without a doubt worth seeing over and over again and I recommend this to anybody with good taste in comedy. In other words, see this movie if you think you know a decent comedy when you see one. The only down side to this movie was Steve Buscemi's character dying, but I guess it added something to the plot that was necessary."
5,My favorite movie of the decade,"This movie is both hilarious and profound! The complex relationship between the laidback Dude and the excitabe Walter is wonderfully cast and acted. John Tuturro as Jesus is brilliant, Juliane Moore is cooly sexy; the plot is goofy. The soundtrack is delightful. I have never watched a video over and over the way I have this one. It's funny on so many levels, and in spite of large doses of ""black"" humor and abundant ""cussing"", it's a very positive film. The Dude abides."
4,whoops!,"I made a mistake. I didn't realize this HD DVD was not viewable on my computer or regular DVD player. I can't watch it and will end up trying to resell it and buy a regular DVD. This was a gift for my boyfriend. The seller did a great job getting it to me before Christmas, and I appreciate that more than you know. The seller was not at fault for my mistake...."
3,the dude abides,The packaging was a little messed up. The corners of the display box were dented. But overal the dude abides & the item really ties the room together.
4,see it for free on hulu (with ads) - great movie,"just that.. i saw it on hulu a few weeks back. should still be there. video quality is actualy quite nice -- i full screen it onto my 56""..otherwise, the movie was fantastic. a must see."
2,Misleading!,"I bought the ""collectors edition"" only to feel completely ripped off! There is nothing new on this DVD! It is essentially the same as the original DVD. The documentary on the making of the movie is the same documentary that is on the old DVD! There are previously unreleased ""still"" images (big deal!) and a new ""Introduction"" that is kinda funny, but overall there is nothing new on this disc. The picture has been ""digitally remastered"", but that is it! There are even fricking previews!!!!! After I bought the DVD, I found out about the ""Achievers edition"" which has multiple discs, etc. I could not find it in any stores. I'm sure that the ""Achievers Edition"" is the ""real"" Collectors Edition. Overall, very misleading! Dissappointing!! Big time!"
1,Doesn't work on my DVD player; could you send me one that does?,Doesn't work on my player; could you send one that does? I have a Blu Ray player with up to date firmware.
1,Don't get suckered in!!!!!,"I was told by many people to see this movie because it was ""hilarious!"" Sure it was! I laughed a whole 3 times during the movie. I feel bad for anyone who shells out money to see this pointess film. The plot goes nowhere. With so many charcters twists in the movie you would think the ending would make the movie better. NO! No charcter was funny at all. If you are into drugs then this is the movie for you!"
1,this didn't abide,"the movie skipped and froze early on....took it out, cleaned my dvd player, and tried again--same thing....noticed scratches on the disk...want replacement but I was informed I couldn't get a replacement, so returned it...very very disappointed!!!!"
1,I didn't care for this movie........,"Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are the key players in this movie. To me....they could not save this movie. I found little humor throughout the movie...there are a few comedic moments but overall I had few laughs. This sort of movie might appeal to some, but not to me. I highly recommend renting this one first before you buy it."
2,mainstream weird,"I must admit, I think this tries very hard to be counter-cultural and it has really great actors in it, but alas it just didn't hit the mark for me. It is a hollywood production at heart, even if it has quirky details. So it was striving to be like an Indie film, sincerely striving. That made it boring to me. Nothing to savor. This is the only Coen film that failed for me, as I am a big fan of their other work.Not recommended, unless your like lazy bowlers who get into improbably wierd adventures."
1,Blu-ray of Big Lebowski did not work on my Samsung Blu-ray player!,"This was a Xmas gift and I was very upset when my son was unable to play this blu-ray on our Samsung player- which is maybe a year old. The Amazon product information does not state this. The back of the box does state ""that it may not play on some players"", in very fine print of course, but how is one to know until it's opened and tried. One doesn't usually read the fine print of a blu-ray or DVD! Waiting to hear from him if it worked on his PS3. Not happy- Beware of this blu-ray!"
2,Cult Movie-Somewhat Overrated.,"It's becomea cult movie but is somewhat of a ""gutter ball"" - acting is not that great."
2,it was okay,"I really did not enjoy this movie at all. Yes, it was funny at points, but overall I found it stupid, imature, and embarrassing to the film industry. It had no great plot and it glorified drugs and sex to an extreme point. On a lighter note, some parts were funny and entertaining, but this is on the lowest level of humor, the kind that takes out any logic and intelligence, insulting the audience's minds. Over all I do not reccomend this movie to those capable of higher thought."
5,A Classic in My Library of Films,"If you own Animal House, Vacation, Dumb & Dumber, Fletch or Austin Powers----You will definetly want The Big Lebowski. Its one that can be watched over and over and over and amuse you to no end. It needs to be seen at least 3 times to catch all the sacrastic humor that just kind of skips by on the first go around."
4,An ordinary guy with big problems,"A millionaire's young wife is supposedly kidnapped. And it just so happens that the millionaire shares the same name with The Dude. Two thug's break into The Dude's house and ruin his favorite carpet... what can you say? They had the wrong Lebowski. So the dude tries to get his carpet replaced (because it really tied the room together, afterall) and embarks on a wild journey with his paranoid best friend, euro-trash anarchists, an erotic artist, and an eccentric Latino bowler.The story itself is pretty arbitrary... it's the oddball cast of characters that really makes the movie so chraming. It stars Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and Steve Buscemi. The characters are quirky and very loveable. The dialogue is witty but not for the faint of heart. And the DVD comes in both standard and widescreen formats. This is among one of my favorite movies."
5,should be part of every DVD collection,"Three comedies should be in every DVD collection.""The Big Lebowski"", ""All of me"" (Steve Martin); ""Midnight Run"" (Robert DeNiro).Highly enjoyable and the more you watch these flicks, the funnier they get... Odd but true."
5,still one of the best movies ever!!,"2 disks are better the one! the big lebowski is still, after 10 years, one of the best movies ever made. when i saw it in theaters back in 1998, i had never seen anything like it... and it still stands alone. jeff bridges and john goodman are pitch perfect as the two lead rolls of the dude and walter.so many other great preformances i could go on forever talking about them. the second disk is worth watching if your an ""achiver"" (thats what lebowski fans are called... think of trekies only cool). the bowling ball case was a fantastic idea and also looks great. all in all this set has a lot of in and lots of outs and a lot of what have you. highly recomended!"
5,The Dude Abides!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is one of the greats.My whole family loves it.The package is great.All around a great buy!!!!!!!
5,Come on! It's the best. Are we gonna split hairs here?,"What can I say, anyone who gives this a low rating shouln't be looking for it on Amazon.com. Am I wrong? They need to breathe. They're being very ""undude"". If they only saw it once, it's not enough. If they have seen it 100 times, it's not enough. Labowski (the bum) gives laziness a good name. There's always something new to see in the movie. It's really ""tied together"" well. Wonderfully hillarious storyline."
5,Goodman and Bridges in top form in Lebowski!!!!!,"This comedy aboud mistaken identity is a great movie. Jeff Bridges plays a perfect ""Dude"", with a wonderful portrayal of the laid-back, pot-smoking character. Walter, the Dude's best friend is my favorite character in any comedy I have ever seen. John Goodman really nails this character. For an even higher level of enjoyment, read along with the movies script as you watch the movie to really grasp how good Bridges and Goodman are. I have watched this movie around twenty times, and my interest for the movie grows each time. A hilarious uproar by the Coen brothers who have out done themselves this time. The interview with the brothers on this DVD is a great way to further understand some of the film. A great DVD that any Coen brothers fan, John Goodman fan, Jeff Bridges fan, John Turturro fan, Steve Buscemi fan, or fan a great comedy should own."
4,"The film, while comedy to some, is very real to","Anyone who lives in southern California is inevitably exposed to each and every one of the characters in The Big Lebowski, and they are all real. The Coens, as usual, demonstrate an uncany ability to capture the reality of those who lead ordinary as well as offbeat lives and make it comedic. Even in tragedy, they fnd a way to also portray some of the dignity in humdrum existence (like in the death of the Buscemi character and camp burial of ashes). While not a companion in the strict sense to Fargo, it nonetheless belongs in a special place with that and their other films."
4,Waited way too long to see it,"Strong performances, and I love the Coen brothers' sensibility. It's not my favorite of theirs -- that would be O Brother Where Art Thou -- but it's very good."
5,One of the funniest movies I ever watched!,"I know it's an old movie, but I loved it. No one could've played Lebowski better than Bridges! It's great!"
5,the big lebowski,this is the funniest dysfunctional group of chsaractors! Jeff Bridges is great in it as are all the charactors! Hilarious!
5,The DUDE is a role model,"I have to have a Cohen Brothers fix every so often. Beschemi, Bridges, and Goodman are classic, Love this movie....Let's go bowling."
5,A very funny movie,"The characters, the lines, the music. I love this show. Non-stop laughs. I'll list some key parts of the movie to let you know if the comedy is your flavor.-mentions a porno movie named ""Log Jammin'"" and shows a clip from it(yes it has wah-wah guitar).-a Hispanic pedophile bowler (and snappy dresser) named Jesus.-""this is what happens when you f**k another man in the a**, Larry.""-""shut the f**k up Donnie.""-""Let me tell you something, bendeco. You pull any of your crazy s**t with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away form you and stick it up your a** and pull the f**ning trigger til it goes click"".The people who gave this movie 1 star are either Carrot Top fans or they didn't watch the movie. I've seen it probably 10 times. I don't normally watch movies more than once. It gets funnier and funnier every time. Very gratuitous use of the ""F"" word."
5,Great Performances captured in an abstract masterpiece,"This is one of those movies where you own the DVD and have watched it 10 times, but when it comes on cable you can't turn it off. Almost every actor in this Cohen Brothers' masterpiece turns in a character acting performance that is absolutely stunning. John Goodman steals the show as a violent, overweight Vietnam veteran who can't control his anger at bowling tournaments. Julianne ""Before I was famous"" Moore plays an offkey role as an eccentric, butch haircut feminist. John Turturro plays a child molesting bowler named Jesus who even John Goodman doesn't want to get near. Jeff Bridges is bland but brilliant.The movie meshes from scene to scene with effortless cinematography that could only be drafted from the minds of Joel and Ethan Cohen. The dream sequences are absolutely over the top, and the dialogue is brilliant in its simplicity. Score one for ""The Dude"" this move definitely prevails. One of my top 10 of all time."
5,Perfect,"Trying to convey the pace and appeal of this film is like trying to eat soup with a fork. It has to be experienced, preferably multiple times, for the sheer joy of its absurdity and leisurely social commentary to sink in. That many folks have never heard of it and yet there are over 800 testimonials to it here should give some indication of the glorious cult that has arisen around this film. And that there is an ""Achiever's"" edition available, with coasters and a collectible bowling towel, is even more perfect. Sometimes the world's alright."
3,It was OK,"Some funny parts but did not make me want to watch it again. I was told that this was very funny, but found it amusing at best."
2,Weak By Modern Standards,"Tried watching this after enjoying True Grit and O Brother Where Art Thou, which were great. This movie was just much slower. Not as stimulating on the brain and easy to lose interest. There are great nuggets but you just have to wait so long for them while it is boring between the nuggets. Compared to modern day action and modern day comedy this one is weak. The cast does a great job. Very good. John Goodman is so good being an aggravating person that I don't even want to keep watching so I don't have to be around him!"
3,Why is this movie so popular?,"This movie is just 'so so'. Its not great at all.I can't understand all the hype about this convoluted, silly, borderline boring- movie. I don't get it. Maybe if you are 'on' something while watching this dumb flick, its great. But not watching it sober; its not great in any way whatsoever."
1,Never watched it because it wouldn't download,We should not have to pay for this as we were never able to download it. I think we watched a few minutes by spending half an hour trying to get it going. Very poor service.
5,"""Aufwachen Arshloch!""","If I could give this movie more than 5 stars, I would. It is worth every star I could give. This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The acting was all amazing, especially John Goodman. He was hilarious in his role as Walter, the Vietnam vet. I have seen this movie multiple times now and it just gets better every time. There are scenes where I laugh so hard I'm close to tears. It's so much differentthan all the other comedies that come out. It really is a great change of pace. If you don't get at least a few laughs out of this movie you don't have any sense of humor. Watch it, and watch it often!"
3,Hippie Slacker with Bowling Ball,"Two young brothers from cold Minnesota must have had a rich fantasy life in the midst of mid-western snowstorms. Their Fargo was a sly satire of prairie folks. But before there were Fargo and Academy Awards, there was The Big Lebowski, which for actor Jeff Bridges is his signature career role, The Dude.The plot is a LA, Raymond Chandler style mystery; it's hard to tell the bad guys and femme fatales without a scorecard.The similarities stop there. Dude is a middle aged longhaired, hippy slacker with a bowling ball. His pal John Goodman is a Vietnam freak-out converted to Judaism. Together they meet the Fritz brothers, the nympho-artist, and assorted freaks on the way to solving a mystery that really doesn't matter. This one is for laughs."
1,NOT WIDESCREEN?!?!?!?,"WTF? Why is this not widescreen? Who the hell would buy this film cropped? I'm so pissed I'm going to have to return this. It's a special edition. Seriously, who the hell wants a damn pan and scan version if your a fan?"
5,"""It was parked in a handicap zone. Perhaps they towed it.""","MY FAVORITE MOVIE! From the way it was shot, where it was shot, the overall feeling of the movie, the dialogue....I love this movie. Buy it, you'll like it!!!!"
5,Funniest movie of all time,"I love this movie, it made me laugh more than any movie I have ever seen. People say it had too many F-words..blah, blah, blah..wah, wah, wah! So what who cares? Not me, I here worse language at school! And hearing swear words never bothers me, it made the movie funnier anyway! So to all those ""Polished, non-swearing people"" F-you! This movie rules!"
3,The Big Lebowski,The movie kept reloading and freezing up.This made it very hard to enjoy. I downloaded the Big Lebowski from online tv.
5,Awesome movie,This movie is one of the best of all time. I bet I have seen it 20 times and still enjoy it when its on.
4,"Great movie, lots of laughs!",Love this movie heard about it on the FILM VAULT and have since bought it! Great acting and great casting! A must watch :)
5,Goodman wins...,"This is a great and very funny film. A case of mistaken identity leads Jeff Bridges 'Dude' into all sorts of problems. The Dude is extremely laid back (stoned a lot) - the Coens wrote the part for Jeff Bridges.A number scenes standout, but the Bowling Alley ones are particular favourites of mine. The cast are fantastic, and for me John Goodman as Vietnam Vet Walter just steals the acting honours. Walter is obsessed with Vietnam, to the point where he introduces Vietnam into any conversation regardless of whats being talked about. One of the very last scenes is an extremly funny example of this.I've lent the film to a lot of people and there is a split with this film between those that love it and those that really don't get it. So if you're unsure catch it on TV or rent it. If you like it you will have to buy it and watch it again very quickly."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Blu-ray transfer","The 2-star review has nothing to do with the quality of the movie... I thoroughly enjoy ""The Big Lebowski"", and have seen it many, many times. The problem is the transfer: grainless, lifeless, and not at all film-like. It doesn't represent the character of film in any way, looking quite like an early, heavily scrubbed hi-def video transfer. It's at least better than the first-issue DVD I own, but anyone who has any of the DVD re-issues would be hard-pressed to find a great improvement in this version.I saw the film in 35mm last year at our local art-house cinema, and it looked MUCH better than this release. Yeah, it wasn't a particularly crisp film, and did show some age....but it did contain film grain, and it looked real. Of course, if Universal actually released a high-quality transfer of ""Lebowski"", they'd have no reason to re-release every few years (and lose a nice revenue stream.Very disappointing!"
5,Don't get it?,"If you don't get this film, it may be time to re-evaluate your sense of humor and your existence in society. People who don't take themselves too seriously and appreciate some good, whitty and well-delivered nonsense get this film. Perhaps, that's what this is about in a sense. The Dude is just trying to chill, and finds himself stuck with a bunch of ridiculous characters who take themselves too seriously. It's very funny that he is absolutely the most well-adjusted character in the flick. How can that NOT be funny? It's a brilliant parody of our uptight and senseless social worlds. If you need a plot to follow what the point is... Well, Brandt, I just don't know what to tell you.""This aggression will not stand, MAN"""
5,Amazing movie...even better video quality,"this HD DVD is amazing! The video and sound quality is amazing and the movie itself is a classic. Oh and as far as the guy below saying Blu-Ray is outselling HD DVD...times are changing quick my friend, check around."
5,Perfection,"The whole thing is worthy of constant reference and is infinitely quotable...this is a brilliant, perfect movie. It's exponentially funnier with each viewing. The Dude is a Jesus like figure who exemplifies modern slackdom. He's a lackadaisical, cannabis-smoking anti-hero, whose ambition is limited to bowling and drinking White Russians.THE DUDE: That's just like, your opinion, man."
3,Not as funny as advertised by one website I saw,"This might be really funny if you were high, other than that its more slapstick comedy. Good for those who were teens in the seventies."
3,not as funny as everyone seems to think it is.,this movie makes me want to drink White Russians more than it makes me want to laugh. it's worth seeing but man do people over hype this move. rent don't buy.
2,Disk came in paper sleeve,Disk came in a paper sleeve and skipped during certain parts of the movie... Not sure if it's a bootlegged copy or not.
1,Has anyone noticed..,"The only new feature on the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD is the remastered picture and sound? The bonus features on the new DVD are already available on the DVD that is out now, excluding the remastered picture, a possibly very short 'Intro,' and the I'm sure ultra-exciting photo gallery? I'm sure the 'Making Of' feature is the same one we have already. The ONLY reason I'm even buying this one is because of the new transfer on the DVD. As for the Achiever's gift set, it should AT LEAST include a second disc full of REAL bonus features to warrant THAT price.For more information:http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/Reviews/bigl.htm- Zack, 16 years old"
1,the dvd was bad,"the dvd had so many skips in it that i had to return it. it did not look like a movie that i would have enjoyed, so i did not re-order that movie. i ordered something else."
4,THE DUDE!!!,"The Big Lebowski is the ultimate cult film for dudes out there who just want that cool film, you know?The Dude is the cult idol of our generation. Lazy, lazy and lazy.This DVD comes with perfect Quality of my favorite film and a little Extra. This is a must-own.I quote this movie with friends all the time. GREAT!!!"
5,There's a little Dude in all of us.,"Excellent performances by all. Comedy + Suspense + A big of Naughty This 'n That and you've got The Big Lebowski. A terrific treat for open minded fun-loving care-free individuals everywhere. For everyone else, much needed therepy. The first couple of reviewers hit the nail on the head and I couldn't agree more."
5,"This is what happens. THIS is what HAPPENS, when you...","This is a terrific, hilariously prurient film, with all sorts of great nuances and twists.I gave it to a friend on his 49th birthday. At a family gathering to celebrate, he mentioned he'd received The Big Lebowski as a gift. His nephew, 22, started bubbling: ""Oh man, oh man, The Big Lebowski is the greatest movie ever made! It's the greatest movie in history! Oh man, I watch it ever week, it's the best movie I've ever seen!!"" and so on.My friend's little 70-something mother said, ""Oh, good -- let's watch it after we finish eating!""And the moral of the story is: Regardless how great and fantistic you hear that a movie might be, do not EVER EVER EVER watch it with your mother unless you've seen it by yourself first.P.S. The Dude abides!P.P.S. Did you happen to notice the date on the check the Dude wrote, in the grocery store at the beginning of the movie? The year is 1991 -- the day Sept. 11."
4,"funny, weird movie","this is a great comidy, but im still not sure i intirely understand the plot. oh well. very funny movie. that you might want to watch some time."
3,Hardly outstanding,"O.K this is a pretty funny film, but why is it so damn popular?. It lacks the Coens' usual flair. The main reason being a completely motionless plot. Don't get me wrong some bits are laugh out loud funny but others get bogged down in a dumb storyline.It is a fine no-brainer comedy with a touch of the brothers quality, and some excellent characters, notably Jesus. But I for one expect more invention from directors as clever as the Coens'. I would like to say yeah great film like I usually do. But this time I just can't."
2,Finally saw it. Not my thing,"This felt like an excessively long and violent Saturday Night Live skit. I was getting impatient anyway, so the toe was my breaking point."
5,Definately would love a sequel to this one!!,"It's weird how some movies you would never expect a sequel to, gets a sequel, and the ones you'd expect a sequel from...never happens.The Big labowski offers a unique comedy in such a well written and portrayed way, it makes you think it was created just for you. The chemistry between the actors, as well as the characters they play, is definately what makes this movie Great. If any character in the movie was replaced with any other actor, it wouldn't have worked.The storyline isn't predictable, which is a good quality for any movie. Always 'thinking' you know what is going to happen, and it doesn't....will keep you glued to the screen.Again, the movie is hilarious. The sense of humor inside the man that envisioned this story, makes him unique indeed.The Big Labowski is fun to watch. Definately a re-watcher. It will take you away from a stressful day, for at least the length of the movie."
1,Don't believe the Stoner Hype,"I heard so many people (usually burned out stoners with skulls full of mush) rave about this movie, so I bought it. Big mistake. Like most mediocre movies, it has some moments, but overall sucky."
5,Off the Wall & Great!,"If you liked Fargo you will like ""The Big Lebowski"". Great Music Too!!! I come up with this opinion after just one viewing - but it won't be my last."
5,the most complex and funny movie ever made,"in this movie the coen brothers were able to create multi-dimensional characters out of people who were only in the movie or 1 or 2 minutes. You notice different things every time you watch it. It makes you want to move to L.A., go bowling, and be the Dude!!"
5,Bowling is a Metaphor for Life,"Perhaps one cannot fully appreciate the universality of Lebowski until one of one's own children joins the fan club. This is the enviable position in which Wanda B. Red finds herself -- beneficiary of THE DUDE -- as her teenage son self-identifies as a fan.This is a film for the ages. I cannot claim to have seen it 100 times -- or to have attended conferences on the topic, as have other of the reviewers here. I have seen the film twice. But of course it is a premier cult film. It defines an era. Bunny Lebowski is so nubile, even I -- a post-menopausal (straight) Wanda -- am intrigued by her toes.But more than that, I bow down to the talent of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and more than all of those the ""Jesus""! -- John Turturro.And the genius of Joel Coen. Honestly, it's wonderful to know that the Duder is out there taking it easy for all the rest of us. And I'm NOT kidding. Brilliant...."
1,My Mistake,Unfortunately I wasn't able to view this DVD. I didn't realize I had to have an HD player to use it :(
1,"Too many ""F"" words.","I looked forward to this movie. The story and actors attracted me to it. However after hearing the ""F"" word every three or four words, I shut it off. Sorry to see our language sink to such low levels."
1,Simply Terrible,I am surprized to see all these high reviews. My wife and I saw the movie and rated it as among one of the worst we have seen. The Dude character is cute for about the first 10 minutes but after that the movie becomes really repetitive... that and no real storyline. Very disappointed. Expected something much better from the brothers
1,Non-Coen Bros. fans beware!,"Just because the characters are quirky and interesting doesn't mean the movie is funny or good. The character Jesus' potential was totally wasted. He could have been the funniest character but instead his lines fell flat and were boring. The plot was boring. The drug-tripping scene broke the continuity of the story. Any time a movie goer is suddenly reminded they are watching a movie, the movie has failed, and that's what the tripping scene did for me. Fargo was ten times the movie this was. I will concede that if you're a Coen Brothers fan, then you will probably enjoy this. But if you're not, stay away! And do me a favor, don't say this review wasn't helpful just because you like the movie and want to punish me. This review is here for the non-Coen fans who might get hoodwinked into thinking this is a comedy. Which it's not. If you didn't enjoy any of the following, don't watch this one: Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Rushmore, Royal Tennebaums."
2,Too much profanity,It had way too much profanity for me. Basically a weird movie. I would not recommend to my friends or family.
3,"Okay, not as funny as people said","It was okay, I wish I had just rented it instead of buy it. I enjoyed it but there weren't tons of laughs."
1,"Great Film, bad Blu-Ray: DNR to the max!",Once again some moron at Universal Home Entertainment couldn't let his fingers off the DNR button that wiped out the details. This time even to the max!!!!!If you want this film on blu you better should grab the italian region B disc not released by universal there. This no-DNR edition is also far from perfection but way better than this mess.
1,Will not stream at the Red Roof Inn,I was at the Red Roof Inn and the wifi system is so weak that I wasn't able to stream the movie on my Kindle Fire. My $2.99 was wasted.
5,CORRECTION: dvd region coding,"this dvd is actually region 0 and can be viewed in *any* country in the world (confirmed on iMDb and my copy of this disc bought from amazon plays fine on a region 2 only player). a splendid movie, too."
4,The Big Lebowski Review,"I like this movie a lot. It has some good stars in it (John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, Jeff Briges) and has the two best directors in the world (Joel and Ethan Coen) This is a cult classic for a reason, its great! The story is over the top (which is a good thing if you like that sort of thing) It's a good movie to watch over and over again and still get joy out of it, which is why I bought it on DVD. Overall I give The Big Lebowski 4/5. Get it if you like the Coen brothers or if you like weird comedys."
5,Coen till I die!,"How to characterize such a film? Frankly it is impossible. Lebowski captures the nuances of life, while adding a tinge of outrageousness. For some reason unexplainable by myself, upon completion of a first viewing of Lebowski many find it rather inane, myself included. If you are in that contengent, encourage yourself to spend the necessary time to watch Lebowski again. The DVD provides widescreen and fullscreen viewing capabilities alongside a thirty minute promotional documentary of no real merit. Though, the movie compensates for the lack of extra content."
5,The Big Enjoyski,"Even though the Coen brothers shined in ""Fargo"", they out did themselves with ""The Big Lebowski"". John Goodman's and Jeff Bridges acting made the movie outstanding. The Coen brothers should of developed the bowling child molester a bit more with a bowling contest between John Goodman,Steve Buscemi, and Jeff Bridges. It was nice to see a sub story line between Julianne Moore and Jeff Bridges. I honestly would see this movie again."
5,One of my all-time Favorites,Wow! This has to be one of my favorite movies ever. Just another example of the great skills of the Cohen brothers. Jeff Briges is at his best with this wonderfully amusing movie and histerical movie. My advise to anyone wanting a good laugh to buy this movie!
3,Great deck but....,"So I bought this deck for 2 reasons: I wanted an integrated solution to link my ipod to my car, and I wanted a hands free bluetooth device.First, the installation was a breeze, It took me less than an hour, including the removal of the old deck in my car. Everything fits well and is sturdy.The user interface is not the best feature of the deck, and is cumbersom at first. You really need to keep the manual handy at ALL TIME!Now the bad part: I work for a wireless operator and I know A LOT about cell phone and Bluetooth. This thing is NOT compatible with most Blackberrys.... A shame! I contacted the pioneer tech support, and they were not able to assist me. I am disapointed."
1,Incompatible with LG Music Phones!,"Buyer be warned--even though Pioneer states on their website that the deck works with the new music phones, it will not pair with LG cellphones (ie, the new chocolate 8550, etc) for BT Audio. This is a major flaw and oversight in their testing. So, don't plan on using this unit for wireless audio streaming if you own and LG phone--which tons of people do.Had Pioneer stated this incompatibility on their website, rather than having told me over the phone when I called tech-support after a frustrating few hours of trying to get BT Audio to work, I would not have bought the unit. Needless to say, they'll be dealing with my return."
5,Years no pasarán for this classic,"Simply put, the best account there is of the Spanish Civil War, the bloodiest ideollogical conflict of the 20th century. Mr. Thomas' book is both unbiased and committed. Full of facts, few maps, no photographs (none that I remember), and spellbinding reading! Don't miss it!By the way, why do you rate some books with stars and others not? Just asking."
5,THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR,"i HAVE READ THIS BOOK ABOUT 6 TIMES OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS. I RECEIVED MY FIRST COPY AS A GIFT FROM AN ENGLISH FRIEND WHEN I WAS STATIONED WITH THE U.S. NAVY AT SUBMARINE BASE ROTA IN THE PROVINCE OF CADIZ IN THE SOUTH OF SPAIN IN THE 1960'S.USING THIS BOOK AS A GUIDE I VISITED MANY PLACES, AND MET MANY MEN WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THIS PRECURSOR TO WORLD WAR 2.I MET OLD NATIONALISTS, REPUBLICANS, SPANISH LEGIONARES, AND ONE MEMBER OF THE LINCOLN BRIGADE. THOMAS IS RATHER PRO REPUBLICAN, BUT HAS HIS HISTORICAL FACTS STRAIGHT.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK HIGHLY."
4,"Great for academic work, not so light for pleasure.","For me this book was fantastic. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree and this was the FIRST book I read (and one of the most cited so far) for my senior thesis. I am writing a 110-page research paper on the Spanish Civil War (in Spanish) that will dictate whether or not I graduate.This book is amazing - it gives you all the facts, background, everything you need to know to find out what happened from before the war during the wars of succession and into the military coups of Primo de Rivera.However, this book is not for the light of heart. It was intended as a major academic work, so it's not exactly a straight narrative that will sustain you on the beach.In sum, read this book if you're hungry for knowledge, but pick something with a more narrow focus if you're looking for a more gripping narrative."
4,Weird Tales review,"Most of the stories in this volume originally appeared in Weird Tales. The editor, at the time, thought that Far Below was the best story to ever appear in WT--where that came from, I don't know; I would rate Far Below as the worst story in this volume. Overall, I was relatively pleased with the stories contained herein--but I don't think I would pay the $15.31 that Amazon is currently asking. If you can find it for $5-7, go for it."
5,Small and mighty!,This is the perfect size for quick grinding of spices.I like to combine a few of my own combinations of spices and store them for marinating and it grinds it just fine enough.Also you can grind your own pepper this way.
3,Not PC compatible,"In an age when Windows dominates the computer market, it's assumed that a computer product is Windows-compatible unless otherwise stated. This distinction was not made in the product description, and so I ordered this thinking it would work with my PC. Unfortunately, it did not, and now I'm out $15. Please specify whether or not a computer accessory is compatible with Windows in the future."
3,Early 70's hard rock for collectors,"The first album by this power trio was released in 1971, and sounds like other hard rock bands more well known at the time. Like Budgie, this band has it's own unique sound, and features some fine guitar work. The songs are riff oriented but not as heavy as Zeppelin or Sabbath. The only problem is the overly repetitive nature of most of the album."
3,"Bad remaster, but good album nonetheless.","This was a great album when I pre-listened on youtube, but the remastering on this release is honestly below what I wanted. It's still listenable, granted. But the remaster makes the instruments MUCH louder than the vocals, so it honestly sounds muted like the tin can music you hear over the phone when waiting for customer service at Dell or something (not quite that bad, but getting there). So if you want to rock out to the noisy instruments, be my guest. Otherwise if you actually want to HEAR what they're saying, then go find a better release."
5,The Best of the bunch,"Iron Maiden has always been at the frontline of great rock, but this album broke thru the lines and put them as the pointman of heavy metal. Every song on this album is pure gold with wicked lyrics and demonstrative riffs. Of all the Maiden albums ever released, they have yet to match the creativity and raw power of this album. This is by far the best of the bunch and a must have for all METAL fans of every age."
3,disappointingly simple,"I bought Number of the Beast expecting a tour-de-force, and was left with an album that I find hdoes not rouse me as much as it should, and has required far too many playings for me finally to respect it. Even a much less respected album like ""Fear of the Dark"" has energy and variety. Songs like ""Invaders"" and ""22 Acacia Avenue"" just plod along and are mostly unmemorable, struggling for recognition--""The Fugitive"" and especially ""Gangland"" seem to draw themselves out because Maiden can't squeeze any energy or variety or originality from them. I actually have a special disappointment in ""Acacia"" and ""Gangland""--formulaic and without originality or atmosphere. ""Number of the Beast and ""Run to the Hills"" are memorable, but just too simple in structure to really excite me. ""Hallowed be thy Name,"" however, is a spectacular song and ends the album beautifully. And I don't think the enhancements are worth the extra few dollars."
1,Horrible!,"DO NOT buy this cd because it's very low quality. The vocals are power and the music is very slow. It's very bad British Metal. I won't even recommend this(or any other Iron Maiden cd)to a British Metal fan. I recommend getting some real metal like Megadeth,Gamma Ray or AC/DC."
5,The quintessential heavy metal album,"This album is amazing from start to finish. It introduced me to Iron Maiden and it still blows me away everytime I listen to it. It's got the heavy hitters like Hallowed be thy name, Run to the hills and Number of the beast, but that is just the beginning! Every track on this record are metal masterpieces. Do yourself a huge favor and get this record now."
5,Perhaps the best metal album of all time!,"I cannot beleive that just before I wrote this review this album had an average score of a mere four and a half stars out of five. This album truly deserves the maximum quantity of stars. I am hoping that this review will help to tip the balance and give it the five stars it deserves. This is one killer album and if you haven't got it then buy it NOW. Every song ROCKS especially classics like 'Number of the beast', 'Run to the hills', 'The prisoner' and 'Hallowed be thy name'. If you want to buy one maiden album I would say buy 'Live after Death' because it has most of the classics from their first five albums, but if you want a good maiden studio album, this is the one. This album, along with 'Powerslave' and 'Peice of mind' which are also excellent should go down as one of the finest examples of heavy metal mastery EVER."
5,One of their best.,"Maiden at thier best. If fans at the time were worried that Bruce may not live up to Di'Anno (singer on first 2 albums) then this would have thrown those worries out the window.The album kicks off with Invaders and pretty much stays at that high quality. Children Of The Damned is very progressive, while songs such The Prisoner and Run To The Hills are full on speed assualts. My personal favs though, are 22 Acacia Avenue and the title track, Number Of The Beast. Those songs are excellent! Total Eclipse is a naff song but its a bonus track so it doesn't count and it doesn't detract from the overall power of the album. The album finishes with Hallowed Be Thy Name, another one of the best songs on the album......UP THE IRONS!!Oh, and I would say that this is their best but that would be a total lie because being the metal Gods they are they have released too many outstanding albums to have a best......"
5,Raw to the bone,"Enter Bruce Dickinson...and the world is embraced in his sonic mayhem. The first Iron Maiden disc with Bruce on vocals, and needless to say, a stupendous effort. Each song is diabolically gruesome, in true headbanging spirit. Witness the conquest of Saxons by the Norsemen on ""Invaders"", a prisoner's run on ""The Prisoner"", a prostitute's reconciliation on ""22 Acacia Avenue"", the demise of innocence on ""Children of the Damned"", the woes of the American Indians on ""Run to the Hills"", a prisoner-on-death-row's soliloquoy on ""Hallowed be thy name"", the reign of evil on ""Number of the beast"", and a disintegrating society on ""Gangland"". Iron Maiden touches topics from the mundane, everyday life to the ethereal and the darkest of the abysses. No synths, no special effects...just your two guitars, one bass and a drum kit band..churning out doses of molten metal delivered with blistering art and precision. This has been my favourite Maiden album ever. Worth all the money."
4,A Classic,"This is vintage Maiden at their finest. NO other metal bands would have been able to do this. Maiden is unique. To see what I mean, you need to listen to the CD. There's no other way to describe it."
5,NIIIIICE,"I ordered this the weekend before the Super Bowl, rush delivery. I was worried it wouldn't arrive in time for Super Bowl Sunday when I got an email saying it had shipped the Wednesday after I ordered it. Well, it arrived the Friday before. It's very comfortable and durable. The stripes on the sleeves go all the way around the sleeve. I was comparing it to my Polamalu jersey I got at a department store, paid 40.00 there for it, and those stripes only cover the front of the jersey. This one is much nicer! The fabric it's made out of isn't cheap.I have a few other jerseys and this one is the highest quality jersey I have. I've enjoyed it and gotten lots of compliments on it. I will order more, to add to my collection."
2,Hines Ward Replica jersey,First off I'll say it was my fault for not reading the details carefully enough. I had just ordered a Premier style jersey with the stitched letters and numbers and loved it. This Hines Ward replica jersey was the screen printed version with the mesh type fabric to let in air. Not a 'bad' jersey but not at all what I was looking for. I had no issues returning the item and getting a refund.
2,Leaves out some of the best music,I was disappointed by this CD because it left out the songs I liked the most from the series. The series had so much great music and this CD doesn't match it. Three songs with Elvis Costello is two too many when he can be found on so many other CDs. It was expensive and hard to find and I never listen to it because it doesn't have what I wanted. It's not terrible but it could have had more songs and been better.
5,CLAP YOUR HANDS!,"I was saved and accepted Christ through the TAG ministry at the Christ Church of Washington, D.C. where Larry spoke every Tuesday night to many 20 or so year olds about salvation in Christ. I've given this book to many seekers in my family as well as outside of my family and have found that it has touched the life of many..bringing one of my brothers to a fuller knowledge of Christ and to what it means to follow Him."
3,Another pleasant Brady book,"I read the hard copy version. As usual, I started with the editor's synopsis inside the jacket, but in this one, the editor must not have read the book. No, the parents are not clamoring for Sheriff Brady to arrest the football star. The book is pleasant enough, and fast reading, but it is incredible that most of the subplots eventually tie together. That's too much of a coincidence for me. I found the climatic scene in the canyon a bit difficult to follow. It seems like Joanna Brady would have been killed had that really occurred."
5,Skeleton Canyon,Great book by a great author. I love her writing and anyone buying her books needs to look at her website and read the books in order.
5,Can't get enough of JA Jance,"It took me a while to like Joanna Brady as much as I like Ali, but I am there, currently reading the earlier books in this series. Love JA Jance's writing, and just can't put her books down once I start, makes for some late nights believe me.This book is no exception, as it builds Sheriff Brady's personal life and relationships (part of why I am reading the earlier books) it tells a gripping story that keeps you guessing ""who done it"" til the end.Though there is a pattern to most of her story lines, the evolving story of Joanna's life keeps each book fresh and appealing."
4,Another winner from J.A. Jance.,"I truly enjoy reading the books of J.A. Jance and this is another good one in the Sheriff Joanna Brady series. J.A. Jance's writing is clear and concise and the characters well drawn. The Arizona settings are wonderfully pictured and provide a great backdrop. The characters seem real and the pages fly by. This is a superb marriage of characters, action, sleuthing and comes to a satisfying conclusion."
5,Please put all JA Jance books in LARGE PRINT !,Thank you for finally publishing one of Jance's books in large print. I hope you do all of them. I am visually impaired and have to use a magnifying glass for the the regular print. I know you have audio versions but it's just not the same as reading.
2,Cheap construction.,"The seat is far too small, the poles dig into the back of your legs. The decal is what you pay for on this item. Not worth it! Cheap construction."
3,Nothing Special,"The chairs are sturdy enough, but the decals are cheaply painted.Expect them to fade within the first year of use.Quality is no better than the chairs you can get elsewhere for $10 to $15"
3,So/so product,"I bought two of these for my daughter's room to hold stuffed animals instead of a corner doll net. I'm not thrilled with it, though. It doesn't look as nice as I'd imagined and the holes to insert the toys/dolls/whatever aren't very big. I couldn't fit most of her dolls in there easily, so it was kind of useless to us."
5,cool noisy jazz-funk soundtrack for a nonexistent film,"Soundtrucking music from the ex-Bad Seed. The disc starts out with the smooth, soulful, jazzy-funk ""Set The Controls For The Heart of The Pelvis"", featuring Pulp's Jarvis Cocker on vocals. Radio and phone squawks are injected throughout the CD and add to the soundtrack-like atmosphere. Overall, Adamson manages to infuse elements from all sorts of influences, mostly jazz, and make it his own.Nick Cave cowrote ""The Sweetest Embrace"" with Adamson, which sounds like it would belong well on Cave's The Boatmen's Call. The lone cover on the CD is the Miles Davis' track ""Miles.""This is a great album!"
5,Great book,This was a very good book. Easy to keep reading and a good story.Hope to see more Liam Campbell stories.
5,Marge,I love these books and their eventual connection to the Kate Shugak books. I hope there will be more of them.
4,Better to rest,"Good read, I like these characters. I have enjoyed reading Ms. Stabenow""s books. This series is one of my favorite."
1,High hopes dashed with this one.,"This is the first of Dana Stabenow's books I've read and I really tried to like it but, in my opinion, it was terrible. I wonder how on earth it got published in the first place. The setting of Alaska and characters in law enforcement seemed intriguing. But, joy in this work was not to be. While this is billed as a mystery, the mystery is completely obscured by the fact that the characters slept with each other any time, any place, any situation, including some very implausible ones. Add to that amateurish writing, misplaced dialogue tags, Liam's preoccupation with his zipper and a dozen characters all introduced at the same time made this a slog instead of a read. Too bad, the potential for a good story is there."
5,Awesome Alaska Series,"I have finished reading all of the Liam Campbell books and I loved them all!Set in Alaska, the books keep you interested throughout. Great story-lines, greatdescriptions of Alaska and the characters are interesting, quirky and independent,just like Alaska. I hope to see more books by this author with Liam Campbell."
3,Fantastic cast of characters,"The mystery element of this book fell flat as it felt like it was shoehorned into a book about the people in this setting. The characters, with all of their traits and quirks, saved this book, making it enjoyable. A lot could have been done to marry the two parts of the book together. Instead, there were a lot of moments where there were great characters in pointless/bland situations."
2,Recycled,"A perfectly acceptable mystery, whose characters and plot have largely been recycled from the Kate Shugak series. If you don't feel cheated by the author's efforts to change the names and very little else, you may enjoy it."
3,"Leisurely mystery, no action, fascinating Alaska","There is some mystery here, but the book is written in a way that doesn't create any feeling of urgency. From my perspective, this book is a relaxing break from more energetic mysteries and thrillers. Most interesting is the portrait of life in the Alaska bush - the challenges and rewards of living there, and the colorful characters who inhabit Stabenow's books."
2,Lousy Instructions for Assembly,"Be careful with this one folks. I have received instructions from Korea which I could understand better. I have spent 3 frustrating hours trying to put this one together, and am still not finished. If you are going to buy this item, be prepared for a tough assembly, or better yet, hire a carpenter to put it together.AGGGGGGGGGGGGGH."
1,Another Thought,"Before you buy this item, get a copy of the assembly instructions sent to you. You may change your mind.Also, I bet the positive reviews on this item were written by the manufacturer, don't they all sound the same?"
2,Windsor Glider,We did not feel the instructions for putting the glider together were clear at all. We also felt the quality of the glider for the price we paid was not adequate.
3,Hard to assemble,"The holes don't match quite and we had to do a lot of hole widening to make the fit. Took about 1 1/2 hours to assemble. Also, the back frame piece is not a whole piece of wood, but several pieces fitted together."
2,Quality not as expected,"Well, I went through all the trouble of putting it together and there are several things wrong:1.The wood pieces used in the glider did not match with each other. e.g., One arm is very much darker than the other.2.Some of the wood is not well sanded, so it's not finished well.3.The chair creaks when someone first sits on it, unless they are real careful.I would not recommend this product. ..."
3,Good for its price.,"I was a little scared about the assembly, but surprisingly it took only 2hours and 2 hands only. Power tools (I used a power drill/driver) made it easier. Instructions are satisfactory. More pictures/close-ups would have been helpful.It glides smoothly although I find myself sitting very carefully. It does not look very sturdy, typical of a product belonging to this price range. If you plan to just sit on it and slightly rock and not just plop down on it after a hard day, it is fine.overall, I am satisfied with the price and the quality.UPDATE- Sept. 2008: It has been 6 years and this is still working very well. It has weathered to a nice gray. No problems at all."
2,outdoor lover,"Not a bad little glider for the price. It was a little smaller than I had invisioned, but it will work. It was easy to put toether acording to my Husband but He did have to do a little alteration as one part didn't line up. He also added that the wood that was pieced together was done so in the correct way and it would add to the durability. I guess the bottom line is you get what you pay for and in this case , and in this day and age it was worth the money."
4,Glider Love Seat,"Not that easy to assemble with the 1 page instruction guide-Also, almost every piece of wood was a different color. Overall construction is good and I would have rated 5 stars if the wood was more uniform in color."
4,Attractive with reasonable price tag!,"Bought two and looking for third. Very easy to assemble with two people. Only a half hour each and your gliding. To be comfortable we had to buy cushions. It was worth it with free shipping. They seem to hold up well in the weather, but will rub them with a wood preserver this year to keep the luster."
2,Made in USA - a disappointment in this case,"I was thrilled to get a glider for my covered front porch.I am careful to buy American-made and it usually rewards me with long-lasting & well made products.In this case, the glider began to creak and groan in less than a month.My husband checked it out and pronounced that the joints were poorly designed and badly connected - many only used glue.He drilled some additional holes in the seat and base, added stainless screws & bolts, and placed cedar buttons over them.This was a LOT of work and cost extra money.In retrospect - I should have looked at the construction closely - and then I would have bought another brand.I may still do so.Lesson learned."
3,Look Before You Glide,"This product seemed to be a good value after shopping around. While this glider does glide fairly well (you don't mind a little creaking do you?), we found it confusing to put togther. There are two major concerns however: 1. A year later, the back slats have all separated from the grooves into which they went when first put together. Trust me, they're not ever going back from whence they came. 2. It annoyed me that not much longer after I purchased this (at a sale price); it appeared at a much lower price. My advice is if you don't need it right away, keep checking the pricing to get the best buy. This glider gets the job done, but don't kid yourself into thinking it's going to provide you with years of gliding pleasure."
2,American Woods mini s,"I bought a table, chairs, Adarondeck chair, side table, and glider, all from the American woods collection. I was amazed at how light it was. It is very hard to put together. The holes don't line up well. The wood is very soft and easily damaged. The table came with a huge scratch and well dented. I spent about 4 hours sanding and re-staining it. The directions are not very clear. If you don't have a lot of experiance in putting together things, I wouldn't attempt it. Be prepared to drill out your own holes for the glider. The glider was the biggest disapointment for me as it is very tiny. I am 5.0, 110lbs and it is not big enough or comfortable to me. The legs on the tables are to short, they look out of proportion. Universal size cusions don't even come close to fitting them! The worst part was that it took over a month for all the pieces to arrive."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!,"I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing anything from American Woods. If I could, I would give them a much lower rating than 1 star. I recently purchased a glider from them and it arrived in horrible condition. The wood is splintered, the glider squeaks and creaks. We had to glue a few broken pieces of wood back to the seat itself. WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT!! We bought it for my parents for Christmas. We are college students who tried to get a great gift and spent more than usual only to get a piece of junk."
4,Value and Quality,Purchased this glider for my son and his wife for their new home. It is beautifully made and glides smoothly..Very good buy. I would buy more products from this company.
5,My dog LOVES these Hide-A-Toy products,Both my dog and my sisters dogs love these Hide-A-Toy products whether it is this Halloween Pumpkin or the squirrels or the birds etc. They spend hours playing with them and of course getting the squeekers out.
4,Worked for me,"I very carefully followed the package instructions when I went to Ireland the summer of 2005 and I felt fine. My 2 companions used nothing and I have to be honest that we all seemed to be fine. Of course, I'm quite a bit older than they are. I'm using it again for my trip to London in December. I don't want to take any chances. They are easy to take and require no drink."
4,Challenging and interesting...but how in-depth?,"Well, folks, I just finished 1 year of chemistry based upon this book. It is a fine book, although the study questions occasionally have answers which are a bit vague. This is definitely NOT a book for anybody in high school, and I think that the authors often forget that, even though they themselves are PhD's, their target audience has no degree. Although this book takes a look at nearly every aspect of inorganic chemistry, I often felt a bit cheated, because it only explored certain things so far. Frequently, an explanation would go further and further in-depth, only to end with the statement, ""To explain this topic more deeply is beyond the scope of this text."" Give us the knowledge, already!Overall, the book is well-done and relatively easy to follow. The style of writing, though, is a bit over the heads of most first-year chemistry students."
2,NOT A RAID CONTROLLER like the description on Amazon says,I wasted a lot of time and $ to find Amazon's mistake...hope you don't have to.
2,"great singing, horrible engineering","I would love a ""clean"" recording of this performance. It's full of great singing, but the engineering is terrible, with much extraneous noise (electrical? audience movement?)."
3,This is a Good One!,"I'm bit surprised that Buchan's Greenmantle seems to be more popular than this little gem. I put this book as a better read than 39 steps and Greenmantle, while the latter was a study in jingoism, advertising imperialism to all and sundry and dismissive of those of us with more melanin as savages, the former is dished with a plot that is quite unbelievable and over the top, really! This one, though peppered with lots of ""Scots are great"" and Scotland ""a paradise on earth"" and full of ""burrrns"" and glens is still a fast-track novel quite reminiscent of Don Brown's of our times. A good time pass and an interesting plot keep your interest till the ""lived happily ever after"" climaxPS:Somehow I have a feeling that the writer wanted to take the story to China and maybe because of lack of time or dearth of requisite material he had to end the tale in ""Norlands"". Alas, who will know, he has been dead nearly 70 years!"
2,"So, how about more video and less talking?",I was so excited to get this cd-rom thinking it would be packed with video. Nope! There is one little clip for each type of gait and a lot of big type faced words to fill in the space between video/pictures. The basic information is good but it is soooo basic and could be covered in a book on a couple of pages. I would have loved to see several good video clips of each gait. The search goes on.
4,The Afro-Brazilian gods of the sea and storms are appeased,The Afro-Brazilian gods of the sea and storms are appeased by this musical offering. Lemanja (track 3) with its fishermen's chanted hymns is a must-hear. Bossa Nova at its best!
2,not that useful,"I have read many adoption books, and found this one to be the least informative. Many other better books available for less money."
4,Very good,"I started out my Ayreon collection by getting the Human Equation and Star One Live on Earth with the DVD. So I started on the best first. Then I picked up this studio version of Star One.I really like the live album. This studio album adds extra ambiance. The lyrics are cheesy - hey they are based on chessy sci fi material like Star Trek 4.Russell Allen and Damian sound really good. Dan Swano and Robert sing the low parts, which are not as good, but Dan Swano is better than Robert's low vocals on the live album. Floor does okay on the vocals but often she is lost in the mix. Floor's voice also doesn't layer and fill out well. Not bad, but not as good as her vocals with sister Irene on Star One live, which are simply awesome.Guitar tone is very good. Song structure is pretty good. If you like 70's/80's style of metal and synth overlaid with Arjen's humor, you will like this."
3,a few intersting cuts,"The most interesting parts of this recording are the 4 short piano roll recordings of Gershwin playing songs of other composers. These demonstrate the ""song-plugger"" style of playing from about 1917-1927, with its stride bass, rolled chords and very full texture. There are also 2 Nonesuch Piano Roll recordings by Gershwin with material not duplicated here, so if you like these, I recommend them as well."
3,Misleading Description,"For completists and fanboys, if you wanna have every song then do NOT buy this release. FOAD is included in its entirety. However Bonecrusher is missing songs"
3,Three and a half stars,"Subtitle this one: Kinsey and The Odd Couple. Two ailing elderly cop buddies and Kinsey team up to solve a cold case and identify the remains of a long-dead girl. As always, Grafton writes fluidly; her characterizations are solid; there's plenty of gentle humor. There's just not a whole lot of action, nor are there any great surprises. It's a perfectly pleasant book, certainly engaging, but not entirely compelling.That the narrative is based on an actual, still-unsolved, case is more intriguing than the book itself and the last half-dozen pages detailing the case make for fascinating reading: the stuff of true mystery.While Q isn't up to the level of P, it is none the less good reading--far superior to much of what's out there.Recommended."
3,Q is for Quite High Cholesterol,"The only thing that has kept me from REALLY liking Kinsey is that somehow she apparently manages to maintain her 118 pound, five-six figure on a steady diet of high fat foods. The primary thing she does in this book is eat JUNK- two QP's with Cheese at a time, a whole pizza for herself, etc. This book treated us to steady descriptions of Kinsey's fast-food meals, but she is a tad slow to catch on to the killer so maybe all that cholesterol is finally affecting the blood supply to her brain...but I digress. :-)I hope one day they will discover the identity of the real-life victim upon whose case this book is based."
4,Order was filled promptly,My order was filled and shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition. I was very pleased with this transaction and would recommend buying from this seller.
3,Q Is for Quarry,It was not a book I couldn't put down. There is way too much discription. I don't really care what color dress she wore. The idea it was based on was more interesting than the story.
1,Big Sue Grafton fan,"I'm a big Sue Grafton fan having read all of her books but I had a difficult time getting into this one. Took over 1 year to complete Q - partly my fault but also found this to be slow moving with too many characters with little interest to me. Still, I've always enjoyed her stories and I can't wait to read ""R""."
2,Not the Kinsey we know and love.,"I have read all of the Kinsey Millhone books by Sue Grafton and have enjoyed every one of them until now. Maybe it's just me but in this book, Kinsey was barely likable. The whole time I was reading it, I was hoping that nobody started reading the series with this book. I was very, very disappointed. I will continue to read Sue Grafton's books because I'm a long time fan but I certainly hope ""R"" is better than ""Q."""
3,The best mystery writer in the business,"Fire the editor. It's got some howlers that I think were added after Grafton was finished with the manuscript. Aside from that, and the usual Kinsey Millhone stuff, there's a surprisingly touching story or two amongst the subplots. I fear her humor is fading, though, which could spell trouble for readers like me, who don't actually care for straight mysteries. Or maybe I just shouldn't have read 17 of these in a six-month stretch."
1,Quitting Q is for Quarry,"I have read all of Sue Grafton's alphabet series and have enjoyed reading most. However, my money was totally wasted on this one. I am halfway through Q is for Quarry and fall asleep everytime I read it due to boredom. The plot and characters are uninteresting, and the narrative is marred by constant, unnecessary repetition. This is a miss for Sue Grafton. I am going to cut my losses and go on to a more interesting book. Life is too short to spend it reading boring and unimaginative books. I hope the next in the series will find Sue Grafton and Kinsey back on track"
2,"My least favorite ""letter"" so far","Sue Grafton can usually be counted on for a good read, but in this 17th. book of the series, she stumbles a bit. She uses a true story as the basis of her book, and while this sounds like a good idea, somehow it just doesn't work. Kinsey is asked by her friend Lieutenant Dolan to help solve an old murder in which he and his friend Stacey Oliphant discovered a body which had never been identified by any name other than Jane Doe. Stacey is having health problems and Dolan figures that a little police work is all it will take to pull him out of the doldrums. (Where's the reasoning there?) Grafton throws in a few scenes with the estranged members of Kinsey's family, but nothing seems to work in this slow-moving book. The characters are shallow and I never really cared whether Jane Doe or her murderer was ever revealed. I live in hope that Grafton will do better on ""R""."
1,"Tedious, Flat, Plodding","I enjoyed Grafton's earlier books immensely, but the last few have been kind of iffy.... some good and some bad. I was hesitant to invest in this one, but the premise sounded interesting. It could have been a good story, but I found myself struggling to get through it. I thought it was just me...maybe too many distractions just now. But after reading some of the other customer reviews, I see that I was not alone. There are the usual tedious descriptions of life's minutia common to Grafton's books, but what is worse, the entire story is flat and plodding without any spark. If this was a debut novel by an unknown author, it would go straight to the discount table in the bookstore. Only Grafton's name and past reputation are responsible for this book being a bestseller."
4,Q is for quality,"I've been a Sue Grafton fan for decades because her writing is easy to digest; her main characters are endearing and the plots are thrilling. Like myself, Grafton is a baby-boomer and I love the fact that her novels take place in the 70's and 80's. Big thumbs up."
3,"Not the best, but OK","When you get past the notion that a bunch of grownups would spend their free time trying to solve a cold case, it's a decent story. I did not know until logging on that it was based on a true one."
4,Not bad,"I kept fighting the premise of this one. Let's see. You apparently have so little paid work to do that you decide to bum around for a few weeks, unpaid, on a 20-year-old murder case with a couple of old guys who apparently revolt you.But: the story is pretty interesting and I can't complain too much about it."
3,Wake me when we're up to R,"Well hey of course I'm a Sue Grafton/Kinsey fan but c'mon....Q wasn't exactly a page turner. The story was more than a bit flat if it wasn't based on a true case it would be well boring comes to mind. I wasn't sure if I was reading a murder mystery or a menu there were so many references to fast food? Poor Jane Doe, by the end I had lost interest in not only her but her killer as well. Let's hope Sue can rekindle the magic or else Kinsey is in danger of becoming a cream puff."
2,Wait for the paperback version,"I used to love the alphabet series. Now I'm beginning to believe Sue Grafton is just going to skate on the reputation of the earlier books in the series. Sadly, this book was a very big yawn."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"The story is nice, keeps you guessing until the end. But getting there takes forever, too there are too many spots where it takes ridiculous leaps. I read it to the end because I wanted to find out who did it, but man it was a drudgery. The book is very slow and takes forever to get started. I won't be reading anymore of her work."
2,This Should be B as in Boring,"Q doesn't stand for Quarry - it stands for Qualms, which you should have seriously if you consider buying this book. I though P was on the downhill slope and Q is Quickly running amok in a Quagmire of dull characters with Quaint traits and Questionnable suspense."
2,"""Q"" is for Quit it Already","I have been a long time fan of Grafton's since her first ""A"" book and have read every one since that. I even travelled far and wide , toting my three-year-old to go to a book signing and meet her in person.But...what happened? Is she running out of material or trying to find a way to quickly reach her book quota? I kept wondering what happened to the Kinsey I fell in love with in A through M. She's become dull, boring and so damn well...good. Where's the Kinsey that had gumption, broke the rules and dusted her banister with her underwear? Not only was there no clean ending, no closure or case solved but the plot was boring and predictable. With this, we had to put up with two old bickering men.Sue, please oh please bring back the old ""fun"" Kinsey that we all miss! Get her drunk, give her a believeable love interest and bring back the action and suspense that we know you're capable of!"
2,Not Grafton's best effort,"I have read all of the alphabet series, in order, including Grafton's newest, Q is for Quarry. I was quite disappointed to find it not nearly as entertaining as any of the previous entries. I have to agree with the other reviewers voicing the opinion that the author is feeling pressed to keep churning out these books.I thought the characters were one-dimensional and I couldn't get into the story. I read all of the other books in a day or so, but it took me two weeks to get through this one. Definitely not a page-turner. There was little involvement of Kinsey's landlord (Henry) and his sister-in-law Rosie, who I particularly like. To me, the book was flat and I got the impression that the author was just ""phoning it in."" I will continue to read Grafton to see if the next effort is better, as I have liked her work a lot up til now."
2,Long on details; short on plot,"A body is found in a Quarry (Q, right), and is linked to a disappearance of a teenage girl 18 years previously. Kinsey Milhone links up with 2 retired police officers to track down the killer. The book is full of details that detracted, rather than helped, me as I read along. There are too many characters in the story, many of of them interlinked to each other in really complex ways. At one point, I almost had the urge to make a chart of them all and draw arrows, etc to make sense of who was who. In any event, when the identity of the killer is revealed, I was relieved....this book was beginning to sap my patience, and I was about to put it down and give up on it. This is the first Sue Grafton/Kinsey Milhone book I have read. I may just try one more book of hers, before I give up on her."
4,Quite a Different Kinsey!,"This was quite a different Kinsey book, but I too enjoyed it. I liked the idea that is was based on a real unsolved crime, and I just hope that that crime is solved as a result of this book. Kinsey is very likeable in this book. She is much softer and more friendly. Heavens, we see her friends with her nemesis Dolan in this book, and it seems to work. There may not have been as much as non-stop excitement in this book as we've seen in others, but let's be fair - it's good to give Kinsey a little rest from bad people and life threats. Besides, she is working on solving a twenty year old crime, so how dangerous could that be? It was also good to get a good glimpse of small town America, the setting for this book. I missed her neighbour Henry and Rosie the owner of her neighbourhood restaurant in this book, but I'm sure they'll be back."
4,Kinsey Is Back!,"And so is Sue Grafton after her last two books didn't seem worthy of their predecessors. Here she seems back in the swing of things and reinvigorated. Perhaps it's because the story revolves around an actual unsolved 1969 Jane Doe murder in Santa Barbara, that has haunted the author. Whatever is was, she's created an interesting and engaging case, while introducing two new detectives who seem to serve up comic relief more than anything else. No matter, the book felt familiar again and for people who felt like I have that the last couple of letters weren't the best, you might want to try this one. You won't be disappointed."
3,Mediocre read,"I've read every novel in the Kinsey Millhone alphabet series, but this one was sub-par, at best. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great, either. The writing lacked the kick it usually has, and the setting was dull. Also, without giving away the ending, the motives behind the young woman's murder were incredibly disappointing. I was expecting more after spending 350 pages delving into the lives of such a colorful array of characters. I was like, ""That was it...?"" The ending was hastily written, too. It ended virtually mid-sentence. The facial reconstructions of the real-life Jane Done was a nice touch, though. I suppose diehard Kinsey fans will like this one, but I'm one of those diehard fans and I was quite let down. Let's hope 'R' is better."
3,"I love the alphabet series, but this one mis-fired","Some of the other reviewers have said Kinsey's personality changed in this book, but I didn't notice that. What I did notice, however, was a lengthy story that plodded along at a much slower pace than most of the alphabet books. Kinsey did express some disgust with Hungarian cooking, for the first time.I'm sorry, but I couldn't get very excited about a couple of old retired cops re-opening an 18 year old murder case. I used to enjoy the antagonism between Kinsey and Con Dolan, but in this book, it was if they were lifelong best friends. There was little tension in the entire book until the very end, which went out with a bit of a wimper.As a side note, I sensed as I was reading the book that Ms Grafton may be tiring of writing the series, and this may be her last book. I hope not."
1,Wow...this was a terrible book.,"Books like this make me think ""If this is all it takes to become a successful writer, I am in the WROOOONG business!""Plot is horrible. The characters are boring. Story lines are started, and then dropped (the whole ""family"" subplot).I can't fathom why someone would enjoy this."
1,Sue Grafton's Family,I was puzzled by the story inserted about Kinsey's family background. It never was resolved. It was the only interesting aspect of the book.
2,wait for the paperback,"I am generally an avid Kinsey fan, eagerly awaiting her next adventure. Unfortunately, she has very little adventure in this plodding, time wasting effort. The book never drew me in, and took far too much effort to describe every little detail of every place the characters were. The fact that it was inspired by a true story is not enough to make this a worthwhile investment of your time. I am a detective book freak, and have read thousands of novels, this is one that I should have skipped. However, given her track record, I am still going to give the next Kinsey novel a try, but that's a fan for you."
4,Slower then most but good none-the-less,Good-Typical Grafton. Although a little slow in parts. Interesting to find out that it was 'based' on a true unsolved crime.
3,Almost four stars,"I really like Kinsey Millhone, and I honestly really like what Grafton has been doing with the character. It's tough to keep the interest up for as many books as she has done and I think that she really deserves credit for doing as well as she has done.If it sounds as though I'm darning this book with faint praise, then I guess that I am.I like Kinsey Millhone, I like Grafton's writing, but this book made me (for all its strengths) a little bit tired. The Millhone can't collaborate vibe is getting a little old, as is the dancing around about her family. I appreciated the change of scenery and the story was mostly interesting, but it felt a little bit like treading water to me.If you like the rest of the series, this one is worth reading. If you aren't familiar with Kinsey already, while this isn't the worst place to start it also isn't the best."
1,Description,"This book took me 4 days to plough through. Of over 380 pages don't think there was dialogue on 200. I felt it was a history of a lot of small towns in southern California and certainly didn't need the information about all the bars and restaurants.The same goes for the description of the characters, i.e. facial hair, etc as well as clothing and the conditons in their living quarters. The story line was weak and certainly not of the caliber of previous books. A disappointment."
3,solid but ultimately disappointing,"The book's premise is utterly fascinating and heartbreaking, and Grafton does a solid job of fleshing it out. The subplot regarding Kinsey's family was also enjoyable. Overall, however, the book was a bit tedious -- it was very heavy on description, some of which felt like padding. Kinsey's sidekicks -- two retired detectives who are both seriously ill -- were particuarly uninteresting and depressing. If the first five or six books in the series are 5s, I would give this one about a 3 and 1/2."
2,Q is for questionable: this series is fading,"While ""Q"" doesn't have the blatant inconsistencies, dangling plot lines, and poor writing of ""P,"" the writing in this book simply isn't up to the previous standard of this series. This story could have been well-told in roughly half its 380 pages. While I don't object to scene-setting and description, Grafton's style here is too predictable: EVERY time Kinsey meets someone, there will immediately follow one or two paragraphs on what the person is wearing. The repeated health problems of her police buddies -- and the junk food ecstasies -- get old with constant repetition.Virtually every time Kinsey knocks on a door, or makes a phone call, she gets solid information from someone willing to talk with her. In real life, investigators -- much less non-police investigators -- much more frequently knock on doors and make phone calls when folks aren't home, or won't talk.This book is a pass."
3,MY FIRST GRAFTON DISAPPOINTMENT,"EVERY YEAR, I EAGERLY AWAIT ANOTHER ENTRY IN SUE GRAFTON'S ALPHABET SERIES, BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS WAIT ENDED IN DISAPPOITMENT.""Q IS FOR QUARRY"" DRAGGED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING...IN FACT, IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO JUST FINISH IT. WHEN IT ENDED, I REALIZED THAT I DIDN'T EVEN CARE WHO THE CULPRITS WERE...I JUST WANTED THE WHOLE THING OVER! I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY ANY BOOKS WRITTEN BY SUE GRAFTON...AS DISAPPOINTED AS I WAS IN THIS ONE, SHE HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD!"
4,"Suspense is good,,,also read Mad Light","This one isnt quite there as past works, it is just a bit slow. The suspense is good if you like that sort of entertainment. Not a sleeper in the least but is a bit sluggish for our day and age as the time frame is before any technology and personality of this 21st century. I would not say that entirely hurts this read but it is predictable from an 80's outlook. Maybe a bit to realistic ""as if"" the story was based on such a real life happening with a bit of droll character on the part of the offender who does have impact on the way this story is written. I suggest a book that moves much faster and is up to date on this same subject but with a driving message, Mad Light by Maddox"
4,A Worthy Addiiton to the Alphabet Series,"A worthy addition to Grafton's series and an interesting change of pace. Although it starts out slow, by the end of the book I was fascinated with the plot and characters and was sorry to see it end. I would not recommend this one to an uninitiated Grafton reader, but ""A is for Alias"" is the natural starting point anyway. The sideshow parts of the these novels such as Henry, Rosie, Diehl (when will he come back?), and Kinsey's lost family add a lot of charm and familiarity for the return reader. Kinsey Millhone continues to be an enigma that I enjoy getting to know better with each installment. I also find the historical timeline of the series very appealing. My being almost the same age as Kinsey makes the mid-eighties setting of the books and her late sixties coming of age a sentimental trip down memory lane for me."
3,"Good Book, Bad Recording","I love the Sue Grafton books on tape. Judy Kaye does a wonderful job at creating the different voices of the many characters in the book. The quality of the recording is very bad. I have to return two copies of this book on tape. Both tapes had a echo effect on it, and some of the tapes you could only hear any other word. So make sure you check your tapes for these problems"
1,Worst Book in the Series,"I appreciate the fact that Sue Grafton was motivated by a REAL case, to write this book. It was, however, the most boring, slow paced one of the series. Grafton has been filling her latest books with lots of extraneous fluff, but this was completly over the edge. The basic premise is too far fetched as well. Reminded me of my college term papers that had to be 2000 words....so you just kept adding stuff! Also, it's nice to see a main character who isn't a perfect Yuppie....but Kinsey is turning into a SLOB.... food wise, clothes wise and personal hygiene....ICK!"
3,Slow moving favorite character,"Maybe it's just me with a preference for made up stories, but it seemed to me that this book moved more slowly and was less entertaining that all of the previous alphabet soup. I loved the idea of basing the book on a true story, and even spent some time staring at the reconstruction of the victim. But the whole story seemed to drag a bit and didn't engage my interest. I didn't find myself skipping pages or skimming ahead, but for me, the book wasn't that good."
3,Could have been better,Kinsey has been my favourite detective for so long that I started this one with a lot of expectation. But it failed to sway me too far this time. In fact I started another similar novel along with this one and ended up being glued to Catharine from HK Bains's Dangerous Intent a bit more tightly. i wonder why Bains chose to go POD when the book could have been a best seller with any lead publisher.
2,What happened?,"Oh my, I am on book number 17 of the Kinsey Milhone series but I don't recognize where I am. I have left the land of mischieveous, tantalizing and light-amusement to a libre-noir. Toto, we've left Kansas! I have loved each and every one of the first 16 of Grafton's alphabet but Q is for Quarry is just plain painful. Grafton describes each character's very breath with excruciating agony. Let's hope R stands for ""I Got it Right"" once again."
1,Not a good book; the mystery is....umm boring.,"I'm a big fan of the series, but I think it ran out of gas after ""H."" I've struggled through all of the books from ""I"" and beyond, but this one was the worst. Why? For 350 pages, it's a thin book - thin on plot, thin on story, and thin on characters. I can't figure out why the book needed 350 pages to tell this story. Maybe if she had a better editor (or better story)?By the end of the book, I could not have cared less about the unfortunate victim or any of the characters. Kinsey is the same (which is fine), but the mystery was so uninvolving, it took me three weeks to read this book. I have no idea where this series is going, but after all these years, it can only get better. Right?"
1,Q is for Quit,"I am fan of Sue Grafton. However, her latest offering was so plodding, so unbearably slow that I did the unthinkable--I quit reading before the end. The book lost me, was an agony to read, and 50 pages from the end I no longer cared who killed Jane Doe. I think G was Grafton's best offering, probably because Kinsey had some real relationships going (and some romance). Give Kinsey a life! Please. She, and this fan's interest, are both dying."
2,Q is Quit Reading NOW,"I tried, I really tried to enjoy this book. I am very glad that I did not rush out and spend my money on the hardback book, I had it reserved at the library. The story based on a real life unsolved murder had the potential to grab your attention, but with the slow paced, overly detailed, boring story Grafton turned it into I was sadly dissapointed. ""P"" is for Peril was not up to standards either, so I'm hoping the next book in the series can get back on track."
2,"""B"" is for Boring","You'd think by the time Ms. Grafton got to the letter 'Q' in her series, she would have sharpened her craft. Earlier books in the series were much better. In this one, Kinsey tags along with a couple of old, sick and washed-up detectives on a cold case. However, she spends way too much time talking about the minutia of her daily routine. ""I went here, did this, went there, did that, had a diet Pepsi, and . . . yada, yada, yada."" This book really drags, and by the time the case starts to unfold, you're practically asleep and could care less. To make things even worse, the metaphors and similes just don't work. Describing someone's tone of voice as ""flat as a two day old can of soda"" doesn't quite rise to her usual. And although she's going for a laugh out loud moment here and there, she never quite clears the bar. Maybe Ms. Grafton is getting tired of the whole shtick; if that's the case, she should just let us know and give it up."
1,Darker and Darker,"I've mostly enjoyed the Alphabet series, but Sue Grafton's last few books have been darker and darker. I'm tired of the same old whining about her love life, her family, and her relationships in general. Her writing has become contrived, predictable, and frankly down right boring. I usually keep all my books, hardbound or paperback, but Q is for Quarry is going straight to my public library as a donation."
2,Q is for Quite Possibly Sue Grafton's Worst Book,"I know in keeping with the Alphabet, Sue had to think long and hard to come up with a story to revolve around a word beginning with Q. Well Q is for Quarry, is totally substandard. If you have EVER read one of Sue's Alphabet books, then usually there is humor, mystery, a little danger, and of course Kinsey having conflicts. But this book was slow, and when it did take off, it was still downhill. I look forward to the next book, because one bad book is not going to turn me sour on the alphabet books."
3,Not up to her normal standards,"I've often wondered how Ms. Grafton can consistently produce so many very good novels in a relatively short period of time. Well, in this instance I think she fell short of the mark. Usually I can't put her books down, but in this case I had to really struggle just to finish it. At least now I don't feel so bad about having taken several years to finish my first novel, ""The Other Part Of Me."""
1,C is for crappy,"I read a lot. I enjoy mysteries. After finally getting around to reading a book by Sue Grafton, I have to say that I'm utterly disappointed. This was my first, (and last, thank you very much), Sue Grafton novel. It was boring, contrived, and PREDICTABLE. At some point, (I'm not exactly sure, but it could have been when Grafton was trying in vain to make Kinsey's estrangement from her family a viable sub-plot), I started rooting for all of the main characters to be killed. I have never disliked 'the good guys' as much as I did when reading this novel. Hey, here's a cop that drinks and smokes too much. Naw, shucks ma'm - that's not cliche! In fact, the entire book was one, long, ridiculous cliche. Ah, but enough of this. I've wasted too much time reading this horrible book to write any more. Do yourself a favor - don't read this book."
