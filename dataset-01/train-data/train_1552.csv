3,disappointment,"Similar to the first video, I had a hard time completing this video when I did it for the first time. However, I was quite disappointed with it because it is nothing like the first video."
4,Easier than I had once thought,"tried this tape a year ago HATED IT. it was too hard. now a year later (and in much better shape) i tried it again and loved it. The arms are a primary focus here but legs are surely not neglected. The firm volume 1 is more geared to legs so using both these videos is sure to make you into a knockout :)The instructor is (well she sounds like a porn star) but she doesnt annoy me. The aerobics section is mixed with some high impact (running, jacks, etc) and some aerobics with weights which will make you drip with sweat.The tape is about an hour and covers every inch of your body. Definitely a must have..."
3,Dashboard Mount,Use this when I geocache with family and friends. Easier to use when I am not driving solo and have others that can add info and change menus.
2,So.... so,"It does not stick to the dash for very long. Vibration of vehicle will cause it to lose grip and fall from the dash. Nor does it hold to the windshield for very long defeating its purpose. End up having to wedge the mount between the windshield and dash. May work well in other vehicles, but does not work in a Subaru Outback or Jeep Grand Cherokee."
3,mounting issue,I was surprised that a thumb screw of some type is not supplied to hold the GPS to the mount. I assume that is what the eyelet in the support at the top appears to match a brass threaded hole in the back of the GPS. Either it is missing from the Gps or the support which I dont Know. I'm am using vel cro. I used the removable sticky ring so I could switch cars but the heat from the sun does not hold it to the dash very well
2,Not Stable,"The stand shakes to much on bumpy terrain to read. needs to be reinforced. Not bad for street driving, but I use this most off road..."
2,Kason Club 7 Shuttlecock review,I do not like it. Feather broke only 2 or 3 shots (which we used). Even you can not play game for short period using same shuttlecock. i wouldn't recommend you to buy for this shuttlecock.
3,Pretty Good,"These are pretty good bottle nipples, I prefer the gerber ones but the gerber ones will only fit in the gerber bottles so if you have some cutsie bottles you want to set up with good nipples I recomend these they are second best ONLY to Gerber, if Gerber did not exist these would be the best by far so YES I do recomend them."
2,Not slow flow,"The flow on these is definitely not slow compared to other brands. If you fill them with water and hold them upside down you can see the drops pour out too quickly. I noticed the problem when my baby started gagging on the milk and it was dripping out of his mouth. I'll put them in storage for a few months, I guess."
2,NOT slow flow,I have the nipples given to us in the hospital and they are slow flow. These nipples allow milk to flow out when the bottle is upside down unlike the other slow flows I have.
4,Good nipples but not slow enough for my son,"I bought these to go with glass evenflo 4 oz bottles.The slow flow was still too fast for my newborn. He was a good sucker and on the breast had a tendency to ""gulp"" pretty fast, and would choke. I pumped my milk and thought feeding him with the slow flo would help but he still choked.It may have just been the way my son sucked so fast and hard that made the nipple release faster... But he is doing much better with this set up now that he is older (3 months)."
3,Not good with Medela brand bottles,"I tried them with the older slim bottles and the newer short, round bottle designs, with both kinds they slipped to the side and out of the bottle collar, resulting in spilled milk (a sad waste) and a soaked baby. Not really a problem with the nipples, just they are not compatible with the Medela brand bottle. A shame because we don't like the Medela brand nipples either and I do like being able to pump/store/feed with the same bottle."
4,They seem to work.,Really you should be asking my son but seeing as how he's like 2 weeks old you aren't going to get much of a response from him. He drinks milk out of them so I guess they work.At the baby shower some friends and I drank beer out of them. Not the preferred way to drink beer but it worked. I was gassy though but that may have been the carbonation from the beer. Babies usually don't drink beer so if you plan on using them for milk/formula purposes I think you'll be happy.
1,"Oh, did you mean FAST flow?","Like a couple other reviewers have pointed out, these nipples don't really flow slowly. Our baby glugs down the contents of his bottle in what feels like under a minute, and then ends up spitting everything up. I also held 3 of the nipples under a trickle of water from the faucet to see what happens - not only do all of them leak out of the tip right away, they leak at different rates, so it doesn't seem like this company has very good quality control standards (one nipple had giant drops that came out maybe 2 per second, another had smaller drops that were about 4 per second). We are combining breastfeeding with bottle feeding and these nipples do not come close to emulating breastfeeding. We just ordered a Nuk and will see how that goes... will try and remember to update this."
3,IN-FISHERMAN STUFF IS ALWAYS GOOD,"A good little book of typical IN-FISHERMAN quality. Is quite good so far as it goes, but w over 40 species covered is of necessity a tad shallow in places. You most likely will be glad to own it, and will most likely wish it provided more."
2,"Bright, but not reliable","These are really bright lights, but not very durable or dependable. My dogs run off leash at night and play pretty rough. They are constanly turning off the lights, which have pretty sensitive switches apparently. They almost never stay ""on"" for an entire walk, so I am constantly having to turn them on again. I have resorted to unscrewing them to turn them off, since there have been many times that I turn them off when I get home, put them away, and find them blinking away a few hours later.They are probably fine if you have a mellow dog that goes on leash walks around the neighborhood, but not if your dog likes to run.Bottom line, good light, terrible switch mechanism."
4,Prequel to Ip Man,"This is the prequel to Ip Man and Ip Man 2. The movie has no english language (Cantonese or Mandarin language)and therefore requires reading subtitles in english which sometimes move a bit fast. Although the action is very good and portrays a much younger Master Ip, the story is successful. I really enjoyed this movie."
3,No English dub with this version,"As other reviewers have mentioned this is more of a 'background' history lesson film.. there is action in this film, yet compared to the previous films.. not as much. Still this movie holds a great deal of story and characters to keep you entertain.. is this a must? I personally HAD to find out how they were going to introduce Bruce Lee.. however this story gets more into detail about ip mans future and still early days. This is a must if you really want to find out more about the story and if it intrigues you.. is it a let down.. no.. could it have been better .. yes. Is it worth buying .. for this film I will say yes.. but to give you an idea of how much I want to see this film again.. I've only watched it once.. and it is on the shelf. Whereas Ip man 1&2 were viewed on several occasions.And as my title suggests.. the copy I received had no English dub over."
3,WHY IS IT TITLED IP MAN 3?,I hate it when movies plug in different actors in place of the originals and use some of the original actors in as different characters. Movie was good but does not tie in with parts one and two. As I have mentioned some of the original actors play different characters making it very confusing. So I say if you've seen parts one and two watch IPMAN 3 as a stand alone movie and not a continuation.
1,Not nice!,Its awful when filmmakers try to cash in on good movies. The cast is different and they have invented a crappy story for Mr. Ip Man youth years. He must be turning inside his grave disgusted with this. If you want the real thing stick with Ip Man and Ip Man 2.
3,OK,I thought it would be more translation of what was being said in the movie than a history lesson throughout the entire movie which takes away from the viewing.
2,boring,i know this is supposed to be the true story of ip mans life but it was boring i knew donny yen wasnt in it i love the first to ip men movies i decided not to discriminate because his movies have become the standard of excellence in hong kong martial arts cinema in recent years ...it was a mistake...the martial arts scenes are good i liked em but it didnt suck me into the picture when i end up talkin to my buddy about random stuff in life instead of watchin a martial arts movie which is one of my favorite things to do i know there s a problem i felt time ticking as i watched the movie when i feel by the end of a movie i should feel like that was it i want more it was so good ..you want good action packed martial arts watch the raid redemption
3,Good Entertainment,"It's the fictional part of Yip Man's life this movie portrays that might put off some who are looking for something more serious and authentic. I liked it and enjoyed some of the fight scenes as pure entertainment. You won't be disappointed provided you simply see it as entertainment--not that all of it was purely fictional, of course."
2,Not the best book on the subject,"I found the book a little lite on facts, and in a cynical tone which to me was not worthy of the author, and which is not at all worthy of Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders. The reader can't help but think less of the Rough Riders and their great achivements after reading this book. I also found the ""politically correct revisionism"" (the defense by the author of the desertion under fire, by the Colored Troops during the battle of San Juan Hill) a silly argument. If you want to read a better book about the Rough Riders, read TR's book."
5,"A very good book on the Spanish American War, mainly the Rough Riders",This is a very good book on the Rough Riders during the Spanish American War. Easy to read and follow
3,ok book,This book was informative but a little too long. I did'nt like the first part about how they prepared the army way too many charters. The sencond half dealing with the war was much better written.
5,Explains the very emotional and complicated POW operations.,"During my military career, the year I spent in JPRC-SOG was my proudest. This book by Jay Veith explains our memories, frustrations and efforts to assist in a small way our countrymen and their families. We worked in a classified and constrained environment, but we had the total support from the chief of SOG (COL Sadler), the SOG staff and the recon teams. It is a great book telling about a great job-I would do it again without hesitation!"
3,Why were no Americans ever recovered?,"Captain Veith delivers a very concise description of the military bureaucracy that seemed to dominate POW recovery efforts. It was and still is a travesty.The possibility he does not consider is that Bright Light was penetrated by the Trinh Sat, or North Vietnamese intelligence organization.John Plaster makes a credible case that SOG was penetrated from the very beginning. It would follow that Bright Light was also penetrated. Some sources place the penetration agent very high in the South Vietnamese government, but there is credible evidence that the real source was an American (or perhaps Americans) with access to sensitive information.We may never know, and Captain Veith does the reader a disservice by not considering the possibility.Rock"
4,Better for readers than for researchers,"The History of Sir Charles Grandison is a sweet, old-fashioned romance and ""classic hero"" story. This version shows emphasises Lady G and banter, and makes Grandison less anguished.I am assuming anyone who reads this is somewhat familiar with the original. It is a fun, easy read, but to a grad student researching Richardson, I would recommend reading all of the editions."
3,"Spectacular Art, But Poorly Constructed","Undoubtedly the most indepth study of the art of Mickey Mouse. Each page is spectacular and beautifully presented with animation art including cels, drawings, and concept sketches. Almost any page would look wonderful framed. But a major flaw! The binding has separated in every display copy we have seen; every display copy in every store we found it in was badly damaged. We found the same thing to happen with the Art of Hercules. Hyperion seems to be lacking in the quality binding department. We understand that the French version of the Mickey Mouse book (published by Demons & Merveilles) is better constructed. Still, author Pierre Lambert is a hero for tackling such a huge project in an impressive way."
4,Wonderful illustrations; so-so text,"An utterly gorgeous book that succeeds on the strength of its dozens and dozens of pieces of beautifully-reproduced artwork, mostly from Mickey's golden age (1928-1940). But Lambert's text, stiffly translated from the French, has little that's new in terms of historical fact or artistic insight, and it's peppered with small errors that should have been caught. Is this book worth a hundred and fifty bucks (or even Amazon's $105)? I'm not sure; I cashed in $85 worth of Amazon gift certificates to get it. But Mickey aficionados will probably get a big kick out of it based on the art alone, despite the high price and disappointing text."
2,Oh no!,Apparently I didn't read the same book the other reviewers read! This book has spells that are usually simple but the supplies are not easy to get to. Maybe buying silk is easy but finding a running stream in the middle of a city and planting an apple tree when you live in an apartmnent is a little hard. This is the first spell book I bought and it will probably be the last. I think the best thing to do is to do research and write the spell yourself.
4,happymom,"Cute book but the stitching isn't the best quality. Overall, I'm glad we purchased the book as my 5 month old likes to read/chew on it. I purchased another one in the series (the bee one) and the quality on that one was better."
4,Not as good as other Priddy cloth books,"I love Priddy cloth books. We have all of them. The pages are colorful and fun for toddlers to play with. The cloth pages allow small children to touch and turn pages without worry of damaging the books. The rhymes are cute and simple. This book has the advantage of including easily recognizable farm animals so readers can encourage children to learn the sounds the animals make. However, the rhymes in this book do not compare with the rhymes of the other Priddy cloth books. Some have little to do with the animal mentioned; it often feels like the author was stretching to make them fit. Although this is disappointing to me as the one reading the text, my child still enjoys petting the animals and will regularly choose this book."
4,5 month old loves it,Our 5 month old grandson seems to love this book. I think the krinkly sound the pages make and the colors fascinate him. He also likes the fact that he can grab it himself and hold it. Of course he's not yet old enough to comprehend much about the book itself but that will come soon enough. The fact that he is enjoying playing with it and touching the animals etc makes it a wonderful purchase even for this age.
3,Betty Crocker's Outdoor Cook Book,A good classic cookbook. It was recommended to me by a Girl Scout leader.It fit the bill perfectly. Lots of ideas for camping.Price was right.
4,great game,"After enjoying the movie so much, my grandson wanted to own the game. It is fun to play as a family. It really sparks the imagination."
3,disappointed,"We bought 2 of these games which worked very differently. Because we had read so many negative reviews, we opened and played with one which was to be used as a gift. It worked perfectly and was fun. After gifting that game, we opened and played with the one we had kept for ourselves and had the same frustration that so many reviewers have mentioned--the cards don't pop up. This has made the game so frustrating that our children don't even want to play it."
4,For fans of the movie only,"We bought this game for our 5 year old son, and he loves it. It's not very fun to play, as the rules are complicated and it's a bit cheesy really. But, the cards pop out like in the movie and he likes to set it up while watching the actual movie. It's a shame it's not more like the game in the movie, but it's similar enough that for young fans it's enjoyable."
3,"not a bad game, actually","Even after reading all the bad reviews for this game, I had to get it for my 4yr old son, as Zathura is one of his favorite movies. I wasn't expexcting much, but the game is actually a fair representation of the one in the film, which makes me think people buying this haven't seen the movie. It's pretty low tech, vs the metal, chain and gear driven one onscreen - which is too bad - but then something like that would have run into 100s of dollars. The 'automatic' card dispenser is fun, but is pretty finicky - if there's any bend to the card they will jam. But otherwise it's a nice, fun game my kids enjoy very much that is pretty easy to play and doesn't take very long. A benefit=they'd rather play the game than watch tv, so I'm happy. I got it on sale and feel it's a pretty good deal. Now, if they'd just start making that robot toy again, I'd be really happy! (you can't even get it on ebay),"
3,Fun game,"Easy to set up, but rules can be confusing. My 9 year old grandson and I love to play this together."
3,Zuthura...not the movie game...,"Personally I think the game is ok. It looks a lot like the game from the movie. However, my daughter, who the game is really for, was not so pleased. She was really expecting the metal wind up game from the movie. I knew, given the great price, that would not be the case. It would be really cool if they DID make a game much more like the movie version. Wind up and cars that move on a track and all."
1,Very disappointed,"The rules are vague at best, and nonexistent at worst. A lot of the gameplay is frustratingly left open to interpretation. The card dispensing console works maybe one in four times, and the spinner provided instead of a die has a fun habit of stopping squarely between any two numbers. I'm glad I only paid a clearance price for Zathura. I'm only rating the fun level at two stars because of the fun we had mocking the game. Otherwise it would be firmly at one.At least the box art is cool."
2,not thrilled,Was a bit let down and even angry at times while tryng to assemble and play the game with our 8 year old. This game is not user friendly and vague at times as far as direction goes.We enjoyed the game in spite of it...do to our own shear determination to do so.Very leary to recommend.
2,Does it work?,"My son was a little disappointed because the space-ship counters don't move on their own like the ones in the film(we expected these to be mechanic). We still don't understand how the counter dial works, or if it works at all(we use a dice instead) and the Zathura planet doesn't spin at the end of the game. We bought this game second-hand so I can't complain but I wish we'd bought a brand new one.It's still a nice game."
3,My kids seem to like it.,I have read many negative reviews of this game. I was reluctant to let my son spend the money he had saved to buy it for fear of being completely disappointed. I'm glad I allowed him to. While it may not be a strategy game or incredibly challenging. My kids aged 7 & 6 really seem to like it. It was bought for them so to me that's what matters most. The card dispenser works perfectly fine. :)
4,Great Family Night Game,"This is a fun interactive game. My 6 year old and 4 year old thoroughly enjoyed it (and had no illusions of being blasted into space). It's not just about each individual's race to the end - many of the cards give instructions that cause each player to interact with the others. Teamwork is involved to make decisions that keep the house from being damaged, sometimes involving sacrificing your own strategic position for the safety of all.The quality of the card console is poor. Our spinner works fine. However, the board is warping and I will probably have to exchange it. Hopefully there will be another in stock - the team concepts and interactivity make this a great family night game."
1,Don't let anyone kid you: this game IS worthless!,"I support the comments that others make: this game is so poorly designed, it is laughable. I cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once. Forget trying to follow the directions; they left out many important rules. The board doesn't work, especially the way the pieces fit into it, and what a terrible ending with a spinner that doesn't even work like a spinner. What is up with that? Forget this game."
1,poor quality,"I great disappointment if you have seen the movie. The cards in the game we have keep getting stuck and you have to constantly open up the back and fix the button to make the cards come out. The overall quality of the game is poor. You have to put the game together everytime you play it and the board gets damaged everytime. My kids ages 3, 6, and 7 still do get some enjoyement out of it, although they get upset everytime it breaks."
1,Leaking battery compartment,"Although we do not own the Turbo Twister, we do own three other Swim Ways action fishes. All three leaked water into the battery compartment which resulted in ""dead"" fish after the first use. The included instructions caution you to make sure the screws are tight but be careful becasue they strip easily. We tried to tighten the screws a bit more after the leaks were discovered and yes they did strip. If it wasn't for the leaking compartment these would all receive 5 stars. Durability is what sank this toy's ratings."
4,Quilting,Any quilting book by Judy Mathieson is a great add to your collection. Very detailed in the instuctions. Great gift for any quilting friend.
1,This is a horrid Christmas gift,"I sent this over to my nephews (5 & 7) for Christmas and sent it straight back after I saw it. First they were very small for the boys and cannot be used for school or much of anything else, secondly, and most importantly, the zippers are not of good quality, minutes after opening the gift the zipper on the spiderman pack was broken off and the zippers on both the packs were getting stuck. The zipper and pull were made of some lightweight metal that was very lacking in substance and looked like they would snap easily so, would not stand up to wear and tear at all."
5,RIDE THE RANGE WITH ROY,"THIS BOOK IS OK NOT AS GOOD AS THE COWBOY AND THE SENORITA. I WANT A BIO ON ROY ONLY. HE IS AMERICAN MUSIC AND MOVIES, RADIO AND TV AS WELL AS THE SONS OF PIONEERS. HE IS AMERICAN ENTERTAINMENT HISTORYONLY ECLIPSED BY CROSBY AND AUTRY. I LOVE HIS STORY WITH EVANS THEY HAD A GREAT MARRIAGE AND LOVE. BUT A GRAT BIO WRITER HAS TO DO ROY ONLY.TRUE FACTS- DONT LISTEN TO DUMMY DUSTY WHO GIVES FALSE INFO. TRIGGER WAS HALF QUATER HORSE AND HALF THOROUGHBRED! ALSO TRIGGER WAS NOT THE FATHER OF TRIGGER JR. AND IN FACT HAD NO BLOOD TIES TO HIM AT ALL. THAT WAS CALLED HOLLYWOOD PR DUSTY!THIS BOOK IS OK HAS LESS MISINFO THAN THE COWBOY AND THE SENORITA BECAUSE THEY USED DOPEY DUSTY AS THEIR MAINE SOURCE."
4,Detroit Sportscasters on the Air,"This is a comprehensive,educational,entertaining piece.I have been looking,in vain ,for more complete material about Harry Heilmann AS A BROADCASTER.There are recorded archival excerpts about Ernie Harwell and Ty Tyson.There is only passing mention about Harry.I would ike to hear recordings of his voice."
5,Good Book,"This is an outstanding book written by author George Eichorn of Detroit, with the forwrad by Hall of Fame announcer Ernie Harwell of the Detroit Tigers. A ""MUST"" read for anyone who has live din Detroit and Michigan and who has a love of sports broadcasters, from the olden days to the current radio and TV announcers -- whether it is baseball, football, basketball or hockey."
5,The tweezers are very good! They have the great grip.,"The tweezers are very good! They have the great grip, strong hold on hairs, without breaking them.Even the shortest hairs are held very secure."
5,Very good tweezers!,"Have bought several different tweezers trying to replace my 20 year old Tweezerman's that got lost. These seem to be the only ones that work as well. So far, I'm happy with these. The slant is at just the right angle, and they pull out short hairs."
4,real good spidey book,"1. i don't like the ultimate universe idea at all. i dislike the infinite earths dc junk also. when you have iconic characters i don't think it's good to confuse the average non-comics fan (or even the average comics fan) with earth-2 superman, superboy prime, ultimates nick fury, etc. they water down the legacy and the impact of the great classic storylines and characters.2. despite the above, this is a pretty nice comics collection. it's a good read, but just don't confuse the alternative ultimate universe with the real 616 universe.ultimate spidey 1 was just like the first spider-man movie for the most part. this one is the rise of spider-man as a super-hero, getting acquainted with his powers and whatnot, and he faces off against the kingpin."
4,Spider-Man fun at it's best!,"This second collection of Ultimate Spider-Man is an example of what makes spider-Man cool; Peter has to use his wits as well as his skillz, his super-hero life screws up his public life, and he talks a mile a minute even as Electro tries to fry him. The last battle is excellant, and his handling of the Kingpin was top-notch. Arguably the best part is the last chapter, but I'll have to leave you guessing on it...don't want to spoil the surprise!"
2,Don't get too much ideas,"I'm shopping for a simple monitor. That's all. Nothing more. Just something that can simply show a picture, an image, a movie. Beware, this model can be connected to a PC or a DVD player but with only one connector. You'll need an adaptor to plug a DVD player through the PC input (RGB or D-Sub 15 pins). Good thinking RCA. What if I need to connect a DVD AND A PC ???Better think twice before getting this one."
4,Excellent book,"Change and transition are an important issue in our professional lives, going trough the book allowed me to realize the diferent stages and process involved and there for be in a better position the next challenge.the use of examples en refrences is very well managed, language is easy"
4,"Good book, but...","This is a very good book, but also get a copy of ""Strategic Organizational Change"" by Beitler."
3,Class text,I used this book for class. It is a good reference book which explores change management techniques. It is easily understood.
5,Great Chill Out collection,"This is one of the most wonderful compillation of chill out music (arranged by Mark Gorbelew) I have encountered. Every track leads smoothly into the next with flow and sensuality.The music ""takes you away"" to another universe.It is magical and inspirational, transcending and spacious.Congratulations for a great album!Dorit"
5,Smooth ride..,Another outstanding selection from a chill expert. Mark Gorbuleuw has the touch when it comes to compiling great music from across the globe.Rendezvous Lounge disappears the trials and tribulations of my life with a soothing blend of musical stylings that's peppered with a splash of downtempo beat and groove. What I love is that here isn't one throwaway track on this collection. It's a smooth ride from beginning to end. I also admire the import flava and the domestic pricing!This one's a keeper!
2,Ok...,Same as any smooth jazz radio station. Not Lounge music. IIf you want Lounge get Buddha Bar or Hotel Costes. Those are exellent World cafe soundsin compilations. This cd is smooth nothing. Not what i expected and was a little dated sounding.
1,Miss this Rendezous...,"This Redezvous Lounge is by far ear-ether. Slow and uninspired, it follows a host of other mediocre mix CD's that embellish the 'Lounge' scene without knowing what they're compiling. Mark Gorbulew dissapoints in this mix of unlikeable mixes. Even Bugge Wesseltoft's 'Change' sounds as if it would be better played in an Otis Elevator.Hopefully, another,more focused attempt my Mr. Gorbulew will yield a better mix. Yet you want to miss this Redezvous Lounge completely..."
3,A little too pat,"One needs a certain amount of suspension of disbelief to appreciate this novel fully. The things that happen to Chance, while interesting, seem a little too pat to create the verisimilitude Lemoult is trying to attain.Two examples (and I'll try not to give away too much of the plot): The way Chance makes his fortune is weird at best (One of the characters is able to be in two places at once?) and what ultimately happens to the main female character is melodramatic in the worst ""Farewell to Arms"" way.Chance has a pretty good voice, but seems mature way beyond his years. The epilogue seems pretty foolish. The climax of the book, set in a swimming pool, where Chance realizes what he has to do is convoluted at best.I kind of expected this book to be another version of ""Catcher in the Rye,"" and, indeed, it kind of starts out that way, but the unbelievable good fortune of the main character weakens the novel significantly."
2,Basic Primer.,"This is an easy, short read but it leaves the reader feeling like something is missing - like what happens. The first battle in the final campaign of the Civil War, one has to wonder why the author covers a single battle in two volumes and just where that second volume is. What there is of the battle is covered fairly well but the engagement is covered so much better by so many other authors that you would be well served to skip this rendition."
4,Excellent Sound Quality with a couple of exceptions,"By in large this is a good sounding recording. However there are a couple of songs, with a couple of minutes of dynamic range compression, clipping, and distortion. The one that is noticeable is track five 'the silence of a candle' between minute 8 and 9. It's a small defect, but when you've spend over $40 on a cd, you really want perfection. Anyway more discussion of clipping etc can be seen at wikipedia, just look up 'loudness war' if you want to know more about what clipping, dynamic range compression, etc is about."
4,Refill Blades Good Value,"This is the best place to purchase these refills, in respect to price. They arrived quickly and fit perfectly."
5,An Excellent Source on Surface Science...,"This book is an excellent reference on surface science in general. It is very suitable and useful for graduate students of physics, chemistry, materials science and electrical engineering. The book presents the theory very well, with illustrative examples, and it also contains experimental techniques with real examples. I have examined at least 10-12 surface science books. This is by far the best one!"
5,Beyond the Basics,"There are a sea of Windows 2000 books out there but few go beyond the basics. Finally, a book that tackles the intricacies of Active Directory. This book is SUPERB! It is absolutely my favorite information source for Active Directory."
5,Second to none,One of the marks of a great writer is that the reader feels for the characters and the predicaments they find themselves in and the feeling of anticipation at what is coming next. The tales within this book are depicted in such a way that you truly believe that you live in these worlds. Also the author wastes no time getting to the excitement and drama in each tale. Woven between these fantastic stories are poems that have to be read to be appreciated. There's nothing quite like them. This is why it was such an honor to be asked to create the cover art for this collection. Phil McCall is truly second to none and is definitely worth checking out.
1,Not as described.,This does NOT provide the functionality that the product description states. This is just an over-priced USB cable. It does not include the part that actually connects to the product. This is just like any other USB cable you'd use to connect to your camera - not what the GPS needs.
3,just o.k,"the first being excellent and the best this one is just o.k., 3 is better because at least it is interesting and different.I found this one to be boring and nothing like the first one which had a good mixture of a bit of everything though I HAVE JUST RECEIVED 4 AND IT IS JUST DOWNRIGHT HORRIBLE. Basically they had a good product which got progressively worse and I feel that they are trying to cash in on the success of the first one and putting out product too fast and sacrificing quality or more precisely substituting it for cash."
2,"It's Okay, Not A Classic Though","Whenever I hear this song, all I can hear is Coko singing, ""Sometimes as soft as a mist of raaaaaiiin!"""
1,One to miss,"This book, like many museum publications, is a waste of tree pulp. None of the authors can write and the ideas are weak to boot. As a written work, this volume is an awful waste of time, but the new John's images are rather nice."
2,Sad.,"Respect for DMX.I like 'Intro', 'We in Here' and 'Lord Give Me a Sign'.I still listen to it all the time, though..""My baby mutha be buggin' soon as I walk through the doe.."" Lol"
2,CHRIS is right Its alright,"For all the viewers this album is nothing like X other albums to be exact like his first three album. I still get down with X but this album just wont do it I know he could do better, beside he's one of my favorite rappers."
2,average,dmx does nothing new here if you liked grand champ then you will love this cd.if you looking for a good dmx cd get the great depression or flesh of my flesh
3,Can't stop giggling,"Sorry, I can't stop giggling like a schoolgirl...Anyone else find the song ""Dog Love"" entirely hilarious?""There's no love like a dog's love""...What?! (to quote DMX) This didn't occur to anyone when they were writing lyrics? The double meaning prevents me from taking the rest of the album seriously.As far as the rest of the album, well, frankly, it's O.K. at best. The only tracks I can honestly say I like are Lord Give Me A Sign, Wrong Or Right and Blown Away."
2,This is the same s*** from years ago,"Bein' a fan of DMX, this is hard for me to do. This is the generic music DMX has been puttin' out since back in the day. he hasn't changed a bit, and the topics and music are all the same as on his last albums. This s*** was bangin' ten years ago. That's a long time to be makin' the same music. Come on X, shift out of neutral."
4,DMX- Year of the Dog...Again,Top Tracks:1. I Run Sh**2. Come Thru3. Give 'Em What They Want4. Walk These Dogs5. Lord Give Me A Sign
3,"DMX, DMX, DMX...","This album.... to me had only 5 good songs on here. Songs 3, 4, 8, 9, and 15. The rest were just.... ehh not as good. Secondly, he never thanked Busta Rhymes for being in his album. That's just not right. I don't like artists that don't thank others in being in their album. CD was ok, not really worth the price as it is now."
2,Its not trash its just outdated,"The problem with this album and most hiphop today is that a lot of artist have let time pass them by in this album X has done the same thing as has in previous albums the only difference is that you can't beleive a word of it, he tries to come off like this still 1999 and he's still in the running as the best artist..well he's not so it takes away from his lyrics.he ryhmes the exact same way says the exact same things there is no growth here....him and other artist complain that hiphop is at a bad state right now...and it is but thats because some of the most famous artist can't produce good music any more....this album is a flopper X is finished"
4,yet another romp into the thrill world of coasters,This book is basically another in a long line of coaster thrill books designed to prolong the excitement of riding these amusement park behemoths. This latest book is tastefully done and includes the requisite history with lots of familiar and some rediscovered photos and prints of old timers. A few of the newer beasts are included with enticing views of riders being turned in spine tingling directions. Coker's text is well written. This book has enough new stuff to warrant it's inclusion in your coaster book library.
5,Great rollercoaster book,This book is great.It tells really well about the rollercoaster itself and great pictures.(TWO THUMBS UP)
3,It works but is flimsy,"I bought this mount to use on my personal watercraft. It does work but I feel that it's a bit too flimsy and feels like it will break easily. I have the Garmin handlebar mount on my motorcycle and it's much more sturdy.I have used this marine mount on my PWC and it hasn't broken ""yet"", but I don't have much confidence in it. I will use it until it breaks then replace it with a RAM mount.I removed the middle adjustment section to make it more compact and less flexible. It is nice that Garmin designed it such that you can remove the extra section and still have it work."
3,It works but not perfect,I used with my Garmin 60 CSx and it works well but it drops down sometimes when my SUV shakes significantly. Also the it is not easy to use with the DC adapter cord.
2,Sounds Nice but died prematurely,"I purchased the XS-LB10S and the XM-1S with a Sony GT81UW head unit, thats right sony all the way hoping to reduce any problems and make sure all synced well. The sub performed well, sq was good but died 3 weeks after install. Im told it blowed and submitting it on warranty, but the amp is 290rms and the sub is rated for 330 rms - it should have never happened.Looking at the reviews on the net now, the only 2 reviews I have found on crutchfield and sonicelectronix indicate premature problems as well. I dont intend to keep this sub, Im going with a ED SQ10 instead, cheaper and better performing.Sony - you disappointed me."
2,WHY SONY,"My friend bought on of these to go in his truck, and man what a bad sub, he payed $75 for this thing at wal-mart. The bass is muddy and plasticy at the same time, and 330w RMS 1200w max what a joke if you take the front numbers off you some were in the ballpark, the thing was bottoming out when we hooked it to one channel my fosgate (250w RMS). You can get a Lanzar MAX for half the price and it will sound way better. On the up side it does look kinda cool.SONY SICK TO MAKING TV'S AND PERSONAL ELECTRONICS AND LEAVE CAR AUDIO TO THE PROS!"
4,Great addition to Oracle library,"What I like alot about this book besides compacting lots of great Oracle information used every day is the thickness of paper used to allow over 500 pages in half the space of other books thereby making the book alot easier to handle. This makes it much more accessible as a desk reference which is what it is intended to be. I have this plus a few other books in a small stack on my desk within armreach that I refer to frequently not only because they have great content but because they are easy to grab and flip through. The big, thick books look nice and impressive on a bookshelf but I'll bet many of you haven't opened them in years.We have the pdf files of Oracle docs, anyway, so who needs the concrete blocks?"
3,"QUICK REFERENCE, COVERS VERSIONS 7.3 TO 8i","This book is good for experienced Oracle Developers to use it as Quick Reference. I liked it because it covers versions 7.3 - 8i and I am using all these version at the same time. Some times you know commands but not know every attributes of it, this book will help you in this case. This book is handy so don't need to carry all Oracle Manuals just for reference purpose. When you need more information you always refer Oracle Manuals."
1,The oracle documentation is better,This book is simply a compilation from the Oracle documentation. I actually preferred the Oracle documents. I didn't gain anything new by buying this book (which I promptly returned).
1,NOT the same as SAVU! BEWARE!,"We have used Savu brand from Finland for quite a while, and wondered about this new, unfamiliar brand. Then my wife researched it and found it's made in Finland, also. But the similarity ends there!We bought a package and it's been a total disaster. The bag sticks together, and if you pull it apart, the bottom rips and the wood chips fall out!We're learned our lesson: SAVU or nothing. This brand sucks!"
1,Won't buy this brand again.,"I can't believe that the aluminum foil on these bags cut right thru my hand.What could possibly be mixed with this foil to do something like this?Also, the food stuck to the foil on the inside, another first and the smoke smell is minimal."
1,HORRIBLE,YOU NEED TO FIRST BROWN THE MEAT....IT COMES OUT PURE WHITE(CHICKEN) AND TASTES TERRIBLE..I WANT TO SEND THE BAGS BACK BUT HAVING TO PAY THE POSTAGE ISN'T WORTH IT. ALSO MY HOUSE SMELLS TERRIBLE.....I THINK MY DOG WANTS TO RUN AWAY!
4,great help,"I sent a copy to special a friend over sea's, who wants to learn english. She love's it. She live's in ukraine, and was unable to find a good book herself."
4,Learning While Working,"I purchased Learn English the Fast and Run Way for Russian Speakers for a family that recently immigrated. Learning English has been a struggle for them. With this set of CDs, they have been able to listen to the CDs throughout the day as they are doing various things around the house. The husband has been building a Rec. Room for someone and he listens to the CDs as he works. He has found the Russian explanations understandable and very helpful."
3,"Good book, left out some stuff",I was a tad disappointed that it didn't include much in the way of conjugation verb charts and word lists.
1,Not Really A Movie In The Literal Sense,"This is an experimental film from the late 80s by Israeli documentary filmmaker Amos Gitai. Practically unwatchable save maybe for those who understand the subject manner. Annie Lennox's brief, unspoken, and uncredited appearance is perhaps most interesting in light of the photography exhibited on her latest album, ""Bare"" (2003)."
4,"a ""real"" story, not some fairy-tale fantasy","i liked this movie, bacause it shows a ""real"" story, not some fairy-tale fantasy. it was very sad, made me tear up a little, but a good movie. my viet friends said that you could tell that some of the actors were new, cuz of their acting, but also, it was interresting to see a famous viet singer acting in here (the brother). if u want to watch this movie, the second half is the interresting part, and with that, it helps explain the first half.was a winner for best feature film"
1,Very Dangerous! Don't buy this!,I had to take my 4 year old daughter to the fire department because her finger got caught in one of the holes under the seat cover while we were driving. They had to cut the car seat apart in order to get her finger out.
5,A Call to return to the Reformation,"In my humble opinion, everybody who dares call themselves evangelical, and this term is used widely today, should read this book and take its warnings and suggestions to heart. So many churches would call themselves evangelical today, but would not be able to give a proper definition for the term, or the history behind it. Read this book and you will get to see what it means to be evangelical!"
5,"Awesome book, MUST read for all TRUE Christians.","Without spoiling the book I must say this is one of the rare books that I feel every Christian must read ASAP. What is in this book is dead on right as to what we are seeing happening inside the church today and it has GOT to be known and stopped if it is at all possible. If nothing else you MUST be warned about these things. I also HIGHLY recommend ""Christianity in Crisis 21st Century"" By Hank Hanegraaff"
3,Heavy Duty Moeller Boat Helm Seat,The boat seats are as avertized. The only issue with this chair is the insert/mounting plate was slightly to big and did not fit without modifying the plate. Once the plate was modified it went together fairly easily.So far they seem to be OK and comfortable to ride in.
1,Don't BUY!!,"First, the setting slide is located where you have to hold the base, causingit to shift. Since there's no trigger/lever to open/close to release productthis same setting slider must be used to open&close;, which is difficult tosee & begins to dump excessive product to the ground. Also the broadcast isa very large area & not controllable. While applying fertilizer it shoots itback on your clothing & completely soiled my jacket & jeans. What a MESS!!&More work than I wanted, from something that I had hoped would save me time.(The included documentation is lacking, with only generalized settings.)"
1,I implore you to avoid Mountain Dew Code Red at all costs...,"Yes, I said it, Mountain Dew Code Red was an assiduous dissapointment. The once giant Cola King Pepsi was sure to offer a wonderful and crisp cherry based cola product is what I initially thought, however I was soon proven wrong! The swill made its way down my throat slithering writhly downward as the inexplicable wry grimmace my face made turned from bad to worse. Finally, however, I could no longer taste the drink. Please avoid this Mountain Dew creation, it is the next Crystal Pepsi!"
4,look!,yea this book is good it might not be up there with some of the other books from this series but its a must have for the series. so many things happen an twists an turns along the way. hope u like it =)
1,An Awful Transformation,"I am a big fan of the Replica series, especially the Special Editions, but this one just doesn't make the cut. The storyline is definitely not as creative as the others, and it is very annoying how the same things are repeated over and over! I did not enjoy this one at all and would advise you not to buy it if you're looking for a good book. That's not saying the others aren't good - I really liked them a lot, but this one kinda crashed. It is not a necessary book in the series and you really wouldn't be missing anything if you skipped it."
3,common sense approach,"The suggestions in this book are good but pretty much common sense. When someone insults you with a remark over and over again and you come back with compliments for them I think that they will most likely back off, look at you like you're nuts, or if they are the relentless type continue their insults. Some people enjoy being rotten. I don't know if it it always the case that when you feel disrespected it is due to one's own self esteem issues. Some people are just insensative and disrespectful. They may have boundry issues or hidden anger or self esteme issues. It's my opinion that you would have to see the good in the person that you are having the confict with in order to make the suggestions work. Does my opinion make me a person lacking self esteme with ego issues?"
3,Blah blah blah,"It's the same story over and over and over and over. The whole book was a repetition of the first concept in every chapter. No eye - opening advice, and lame strategies."
1,3 years and...Kaput!,"I had the EXACT same experience with my TV that another previous reviewer had. Things went OK for awhile then for a few weeks the picture would go black periodically. Then, just like with the other reviewer, one night it went black and I lost the picture and sound and it gave off a loud high pitched squeal. I also couldn't make the awful squeal stop until I unplugged it. My experience with the repair attempt was also the same--repair would have cost more than the TV. An inexpensive TV--but STILL. Like the other reviewer I also went with another make this time--Sony. Hopefully I'll have better luck with this one."
2,"A good TV, but annoying sound!","I bought this TV because I liked the size and color, and it was resonably priced. It worked well and so did the remote. My only problem with the TV is the sound. Everytime it turned of you could here something inside the TV (like circuits or electricity screwin up, sounded like something cooking on a skillet). Also, wether the TV was on or off you can here some little noises inside the TV, also sounding like something was cooking. It got really annoying when it was quiet in the room, and it would be scary if a fire started! Don't buy this TV!"
3,Masquerade of Love - Alice Morgan,"DESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVERShe had had no choice. In desperation she had bought the blond wig, flown to Las Vegas, and singled out Brad Lucas for a night of unforgettable passion -- then fled, not even waiting for the dawn.How could she know that the memory of his touch would haunt her... that he would search for her -- and find her. And now, in the luxurious suite of Brad's Palm Springs resort hotel, she was all but his prisoner. For he glimpsed what lay behind her daring charade. He wanted her. He swore that he loved her. But he was determined to know her shattering secret -- the truth she would sacrifice even his love to hide."
3,Not the best for beginners,"If you're interested in anecdotes and real-life examples, this is definitely the book for you. If you're completely new to palmistry, you may have better luck with a more focused type of book. Overall, it is well-written and great for those already daubling in the subject. However, if you're looking for something more instructional, you'll have to look elsewhere."
5,McCue knows how to touch your heart through your hands,"Donna McCue amusingly shares her experiences with the reader and she gives you a step by step process on how to know your life and appreciate it at the same time. She made me cry, laugh, and empathize with all the people who encountered her career. McCue knows how to touch your heart through your hands... This book is a wonderful read! Thank You, Ms McCue."
4,Worth reading!,Donna Mcue brings enlightenment to anyone who has the good fortune to read her book. It is a present you can give yourself!It will defeinately change the way you view your life. A truly positive experience.
4,Informative read,I knew very little about palmistry before I read this book. Donna comes across as someone who has been through a lot but is using her gift to help others. The stories about other clients were very healing for me. She has a gift for seeing the past and understanding and encouraging others to do the best they can with their lives.I would be interested to know if any of the predictions made in a reading whether by phone or in person actually come true.
4,Very Good Read!,"Donna McCue is refreshingly natural in her ability to combine palm reading techniques with spirituality, and interesting real-life stories. She is humorous and sincere in her advice to clients and comes across as a real professional in her field. The actual client stories and results, enticed me to get a personal reading, over the phone!"
5,one of the most sensitive palmistry books I have ever read,I found it to be not at all judgemental regarding peoples failings and reasons were presented as to why those whose hands were read behaved as they did.I so look forward to have the author read my hands and meet with her as I dont run across too many books on this subject that gave me such hope for better undestanding myself and moving onward and upward in my development
2,"Confusing, wasn't worth my time.","I started reading Winter in the Heart several times and always put it aside because it jumped all over the place. This time I was determined to read to its end....and it still jumps all over the place. It would have been nice to have dates as chapter headings, so one would know which time zone one was reading in! The read is ok, I've certainly read much better authors.Well, I finally finished in. How can they say its a ""courtroomthriller""...there was no courtroom. And some of the dialogue about oil was really beyond my comprehension. The issue of toxic waste was enlightening, but we had our own issues in my area several decades ago. Overall, a read I really had to plug through, it certainly didn't ""grip"" me. Will not seek out this author again."
3,Timeless classic,"I've had this album since the early '80's (bought on vinyl, then recorded on cassette tape). I've listened to it, no doubt, hundreds of times over the years and never seem to tire of it (can't say that about other music). Of my hundred of CDs, this one one of my top favorites. It always seems fresh and interesting. A must for any contemporary jazz collection."
3,One of my favorite books,"Or it used to be, back in the 1990s, when youth pastor Rod Randall was writing up a storm with his famous ""Heebie Jeebies"" series. In this series Christ also has the power to rid the world of werewovles, piranha fish, or serial killers.I wonder what happened to Pastor Randall, he was so reliable, he not only did the great ""Heebie Jeebies"" books, but he also had a great series called, ""The Misadventures of Willien Plunkett"" which wasn't so Stephen King and was more pleasant to read and preached the virtues of Christ even more wholeheartedlty. But maybe the market is soft right now for such tales. I hardly see any kids reading Rod Randall books right now, they're going for the video games."
3,"I know now what I now know now,ya know!!! hahaha!","I realize this is a christian band supposedly !yesterday i wasnt sure. i checked out doxology and benediction it was pretty cool i guess,but to hard for my taste, harder sound than the other disciple(this might sting a little) by god)(back again)! i checked em out a1t a local book store.if your wondering even though amazon lists the heaven and hell cd as just,disciple its actually xdisciplex a.d.!ROCK ON!!!"
5,Great shear for the money,"I bought this electric shear and have used extensively to cut alluminum, stainless steel, galvanized stell and vynil. It has never given me any trouble and the factory reconditioning made it as good as new. You could not tell any difference in neither cosmetics nor performance when compared to my buddy's professional purchased new ones, except mine was a lot cheaper. I remain a fan of Milwaukee tools."
1,Painful,"I loved their two studio albums (Wax Poetic and Nublu sessions), and I've seen them (or some instantiation of them) live a number of years ago and loved it, but this album is painful and horrible. The music is boring, the lyrics stink, and the singer trys to sound like Bjork the whole time. Anyways, maybe some people like this stuff (other reviews are good), but it's very different from their other stuff, and not in a good way."
3,"Not bad, but not great","This album is interesting and definitely different. I had hoped that the artists would have taken her songs and used some artistic liberties to improvise a little bit. But they didn't. It's her music note for note. It works on some songs, but after a while it gets tedious. I can't listen to the whole album straight through because I get bored. But if I mix it into a rotation, its a nice change now and then."
3,An ok read,The book description pretty much covers what the book is all about. I finished the book in two days. I expected it to be a good read for the price of the book and it's a little disappointing. I had read all of the authors previous books and they were better than this one.
4,This is excellent if you're a fan of Kozelek,"While I can absolutely do without the cover of Little Drummer Boy (which I skip), if you're a Kozelek fan this is excellent. His guitar playing is great and his voice is in fine form. The sound quality leaves little to be desired. His performance is good, but as someone else noted he has this odd way of just abruptly stopping songs, like he's embarrassed to be taking up the audience's time.I give 4/5 stars only because this is a LOT of solo Kozelek, and it gets a bit samey after awhile. He doesn't do much to texture the sound or vary his dynamics, which gives the whole thing a trancelike quality. If you're in the mood for that, it's great. But sometimes I listen to it and have to turn it off after a few songs because it just starts to drone in the background. Overall though, it's excellent."
3,Delivered Product Not As Shown,"Be advised that delivered product has white stitches all over which makes portfolio look kind of messy, busy to the eye. The inside has too many pockets and slits and although can hold many types of items like thin calculators, glasses, folders, etc. it makes the portfolio thicker. Not that by itself is bad if you plan to carry almost all you would in a briefcase but I was expecting a minimalist, no frills, thin and plain pad holder. The feel of leather is very nice but needs care because it tends to bulge with items placed in its pockets."
5,Ancient Historians,"This is a wonderful book concerning Hebrew historians and their effort to write a history of the monarchy. Dealing with folktale and written court history, these historians attempted to give order and analysis to the diverse sources they had at their disposal. The book becomes at times somewhat too detailed for the lay reader ,but the overall result is very worthwhile. Theodore D. Ehrlich"
4,from MainlyPiano.com,"""Cherish"" is a collection of original compositions and cover tunes mostly from the 1960's and `70's, played on piano by Jim Hudak and accompanied by real (as opposed to synth) instrumentalists. I grew up with most of these songs, and it's always fun to hear them again. I would say that Hudak's style is more on the easy-listening side with some classical, jazz, country, and pop influences. The three original tracks are ""City of the Angels,"" a lovely ballad, which has cello, flute, and violins as well as piano; ""Wild Goose,"" a jazzy duet for piano and sax; and ""It's Not An Original Sin,"" a bittersweet song for piano, guitar, and harmonica; all three are very enjoyable. The cover tunes include ""Walk Away Renee,"" ""Mr. Bojangles,"" ""Lay Lady Lay,"" and a medley of ""Bookends"" and ""Homeward Bound."" ""Ruby Tuesday"" and ""Bus Stop"" are both presented as piano solos, and are especially interesting. ""Cherish"" is a very pleasant trip down Memory Lane."
1,No point in buying,"The book is presented nicely, with ripped-edge pages. It's main purpose is to teach one how to create their own grimoire. I expected a lot of information in this book for which to use in my own. However, it outlines very vague things to put in your book, holds no solid information you can use & is quite average. I would suggest making your own grimoire taking guidance from any other book on witchcraft, which will have all the information you need. This book just outlines common sense."
2,Disappointing,"The title of this book is quite misleading, it promises to be a book about creating your own book of shadows, but very little in the book actually covers this topic. The book does begin with a bit of information on the topic, but soon just becomes another rehash of the same old Wicca 101 information. While the information is okay, and there are a few nice bits (hence two stars rather than one), it's just not on the actual topic it promises to deliver.If you're looking for a book on actually creating, organizing, and writing a grimoire - and don't need yet another 101 book - this is not the book you want."
4,"Interesting ""new"" take on nutrition and diet","In this book, Dr. Sears describes what he believes is the perfect balance of protein, carbohydrate, and fat for human nutrition. He bases this data on the balance of hormones, mainly insulin and glucagon, which determines how your body digests food and stores fat. The data seems very convincing, and the description is easy for the lay person to understand. With this balance of nutrition, the body sheds excess fat, muscles are built, and the brain runs more smoothly. He cites tests in diabetic patients, world class athletes, and average, overweight Americans. In this book and the sequel, he gives good suggestions on achieving this balance in one's diet daily in the modern world of quick meals and fast food. His conclusions are much different than the governments recommendations of low-fat high-carbohydrate diets, but the idea of balance in ones diet is appealing."
1,Bad News For Diabetics,"Research has shown that the diets that work the best are the ones with the least palatable food. Having said that, I view with serious alarm the amount and kind of protein, fats and carbohydates that the diet recommends. Diabetics would crash on this diet and since there are over a million undiagnosed Type I and II diabetics in North America, ASK YOUR DOCTOR if he approves of this diet. AND get your sugar checked while you are at the doctor."
1,pesudoscience,"This book has no scientific merits. Nutrition science (metabolic biochemistry) has been well established through vigorous experiments and peer reviews over the last few decades. And this book is a total contraditory to the established science. The author forgets that sugar (glucose)is not poison but lack of sugar is poisonous. The brain and nervous system depend exclusively on sugar energy. Furthermore, a few personal testimonies has no place in scince. Science requires hard data to support it. I believe the author's primary purpose is to make money. It is not true science."
2,Protein Power,"The authors of this book simply read the Atkins Diet and repeated what they read in their own words. There is almost nothing new in this book that you have not already read in the ""Dr. Atkins Revolutionay Diet"". Don't waste your money on this book."
5,My Doctor Was Right!,"My doctor recommended ""The Zone"" to me after my last checkup, when he found my blood sugar level to be severely elevated. He told me ""If you don't change what you're doing, you're going to have a heart attack and die.""My wife and I have followed the Zone diet for the last ten weeks and we've each lost 20+ pounds! We've lost weight since day #1 and haven't had a single week of weight gain in that time. My last blood test revealed blood sugar: normal, cholesterol: normal (1st time in 10 years.) We have been very gratified with the resulsts, and we HAVEN'T BEEN HUNGRY!One thing I have noticed is that you WILL NOT see this book sold in health food stores. The only reason that I can think of is that, since The Zone treats food itself as a prescription drug, they would have nothing to sell you to improve your health.A truly balanced diet, no drugs or suppliments, moderate exercise....what a concept!"
3,Way too much work,"The basic premise of the book would probably work -- if you have the organization and stamina to do it. In other words, if you were the straight-A student type who typed all your reports in high school. And if you are that organized, you can figure out how to balance your diet in one of several different ways and you'll probably lose weight and feel great.The foods and recipes suggested here will definitely do you good, by most modern medical ideas. The protein content might be a little high by some people's standards, but it won't put you into ketosis by any means. It's a diet similar to that used by many body builders (more protein, less simple carbohydrate, more vegies), but the exact percentages used here just make it more work -- too much for me to deal with anyway. There are simpler diets with really similar results, that are a lot easier to stick to."
4,Finally a diet that works and makes me feel good!!!,"My doctor recommended this book to me when I expressed my interest in shedding some pounds. I do not have a lot of excess weight to lose, but as most women in this day and age, tend to compare themselves as to what they looked like when they got married, and what they look like now; 18 years later. Nothing has ever worked for me in the past. It was like my metabolism was not even there. I could not shed a single pound. I ordered The Zone book and read it through. By the time I was finished, I was most anxious to get started. As with most diets, the first two weeks are the hardest. Hungry and the side effects of your body detoxicating is the worst!! So far I have shed 9 pounds in 4 weeks. The weight is coming off slow, but as I understand it, that is a good thing. I feel better, I am not so hungry. Some days I have to force myself to eat just to stay within 'THE ZONE.' I am very thankful for this book."
1,Gained It All Back,"I bought this book back in 1996 and lost 18 pounds the first year, but then gained it all back and then some! It's fine for losing some weight, but IT'S REALLY STINKS when it comes back. I finally did lose my weight, but it was with a book by Gary Rempe. Hope you have better luck than I did with this Zone BS."
2,"If you want to lose weight, learn about nutrition & exercise","It has been known for years that if calories in < calories out you will lose weight. That's it. There is nothing magic or special about eating 30-40-30 or about low-carb diets or negative calorie diets.Anyone can lose weight by following a balanced diet and either limiting the number of calories they consume or exercising more.It terms of overall health, there is no one-size fits all diet. Some people will do better on this diet than on a high carb diet for example, but certainly not everyone.Save your money and buy a good nutrition book or gym membership. Educate yourself about your daily nutritional needs, count calories and stay active if you want to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.I can't speak for the truth to the claim that this diet helps put you 'In the Zone' of peak mental and physical performance. If that's is what you are after, rather than the weight-loss, It may work."
3,Crossfit,"A must have if you're doing CrossFit, or just want to be a naturally healthy person. No other diet comes close to the Zone diet."
2,Boring read but has good info,"My God. This book is so dry! I'm sure he is correct in what he writes, but I actually received information on his gospel from The Diet Doctor on FitTV when he was a guest.If you are going to read his book, have a PDR and some espresso available."
5,"For the first time in my life, I'm down to 5% bodyfat!","Some people don't do well on a high carbohydrate diet, despite what many of the so-called experts say. If a low protein and high carb diet isn't working for you, consider opening your mind and giving this way of eating a try. Listen to how your body responds, since you are the best expert on how food affects you if you pay attention. After changing my eating habits to follow The Zone, focusing mostly on raw produce and healthy forms of protein such as powdered soy and whey, for the first time in my life I'm down to 5% bodyfat! I have a lot more energy and need less sleep. As a bodybuilder I'm continuing to make gains of about a pound of muscle a month, something I never was able to do on lots of carbs. Open your mind, give this way of eating a try, and watch that unwanted fat melt away."
3,Get into the zone!,"Well written book advocating dietary chage away from carbohydrate rich foods to a more balenced protein dominent diet. I enjoyed reading it, and followed it for a while, but sadly lapsed.... Not enough recipes to keep me going, and very americanised, as i found difficulty in obtaining some of the ingrediants. Interesting concepts though!"
3,Better than the SAD but not as good as Paleo,"I read this when it first came out and I think I have about every subsequent Zone supplemental book published. I think it is eons ahead of the Standard American Diet which is high calorie, high empty carbs, high sugar an HFCS, high in supposedly heart healthy industrial processed vegetable oils, low in protien and low in quality saturated fat. However I think the Zone posits way, way to many carbs for all but elite endurance athletes.When this book came out there were not a lot of alternatives. Today I would recommend reading Loren Cordains ""Paleo Diet"", Robb Wolfs ""The Paleo Solution"", Mark Sissons ""Primal Blueprint"" or Art DeVanys ""The New Evolution Diet"". I have them all and have read them all and they are all far superior to the Zone books.This books time has passed."
2,Not the book for me,"Maybe this book has been helpful for some people, but not for me. He oversimplifies and says that the Zone diet (40% carbs, 30% protein and 30% fat) will basically cure every disease. I was not impressed."
2,Impossible for the average reader to understand,The good doctor has a point. If only I could figure it out.
1,Resetting the genetic code?,"The question whether this book can be considered serious or not is already answered by one of its claims on the cover page: ""reset your genetic code"". This is ridiculous. One should know that the genetic code is inherited and cannot be positively changed by food or anything else."
2,Too complicated!,"OK, I know people seem to love the zone diet but I think it is too complicated. I didn't like this book at all. It has a lot of information I just do not think it is easy to understand. My doctor had recommended this diet, but I wound up just doing the Atkins Diet. I would suggest bypassing this."
1,Starving,"I started this guide because it advocates good health not because of dieting. I weigh 110lbs and my height is 5ft7inch so I did not intend to loose any weight at all. According to the book my daily protein intake was around 9P. I only found myself moody(my husband was a first hand witness), tired and could not wait for my next meal. I have used Suzanne Somers' recipes before and I maintained my figure eventhough I did not have to restrict the serving sizes of my meals. Unlike the Zone's trend Suzanne's recipes never left me hungry or tired and I had plenty of energy to exercise."
4,This is the the answer to the diet roller coaster,"This book is a very clinical read, but is well worth it, because it holds the answer to weight loss.I went from 209 pounds to 151 pounds with the principles of this book. Once you understand how insulin works against you to store fat,and learn the right amount of protein and carbs your body needs to maintain your ideal weight, you can begin your journey to eat in the zone and lose weight.It has been my eating guidelines for almost 10 years. It is well worth the trouble to learn to treat food as a drug."
2,Too hard to follow,"I read the book and I agree with the diet, but I couldn't stick with the diet. There were too many rules to follow for someone with a busy schedule and as wierd as it may seem, it was actually too much food for me. I switched to the Atkin's Diet and it's much easier and the weight loss results are faster. The only upside to the Zone diet is the amount of energy and mental wellbeing I felt. If that's what you're looking for go for it. If weight loss is what you want use the Atkin's book."
3,All you have to lose is weight.,I found this book no more or less interesting or insightful than the other zillions of diet books I've read or the dozens of similar plans currently being hawked on infomercials. I am always skeptical about how well these types of plans work but I don't think I have much to lose trying it out. I figure it's worth the $25 I would have otherwise spent on a hi-fat meal.
4,"Been there, done that, lost pounds, inches and feel great!","I have had a lot of success with the Zone. I only had to read quickly and get a feel for the Zone and then committed to staying within it. I didn't care for the technical mumbo-gumbo <no pun intended>, however the explanations of how our bodies respond to the intake of food made sense."
2,my story,"This was my first diet book and I will never buy another one again. The reason why this diet works is because it starves you. It did work for me but I was hungry almost all the time. I got down to my goal weight but I was not healthy. Remember that just because you are thin, you are not healthy. So, if it works for you and your doctor says you are healthy, more power to you. If you do purchase this book be careful and please pay attention to your body and your doctor. I would not go into this diet without some help from a dietician or doctor that you trust."
5,A guide to good health,"This book is revolutionary - it was an incredible insight into the concept that food is the key to optimizing our body's efficiency, both calorie wise and for our immune system. Once you have the concept of balancing your protein, carbs, and fats, you can reshape your health and your body. Interestingly enough, once I got past the first week or so, food tasted better, and the sugar and fat cravings go way down. I don't always follow this strictly, but if I'm going to grab a carb & fat snack, I make sure I have some protein to balance it. My knowledge helps me to temper my indulgences, and I feel so much better and have more energy."
3,So far I'm starving!,"I definitely need to recalibrate here. I'm 6ft. 5, 215 lbs. I run, and I weight lift, and so far this diet has left me hungry, with supreme energy crashes. I have bought all 3 books, so I will attempt to make it work, but so far, if this is it, I will go back to my old ways of just working out and eating whatever I want, which has left me overall thin, with just some excess weight around the midsection. The old ways were working, I really just bought this ""system"" to see if I could fine tune, not lose strength, and not have to spend money on more creatine, HMB, and other supplements.Maybe not.Will update later."
4,"Finally, a diet-plan based on research!","Ever since taking an endocrinology course at med school, I have been interested in controlling hormone levels. I used to FIGHT to maintain <19% bodyfat thanks to all the carbs I ate. The ZONE certainly makes that goal easier to maintain. Better yet, the ZONE is based on current research. Although research can occasionally be proven false by new research, at least this book is based on more than ""opinions"" as to what we should eat! (The 4 stars: due to the fact that the ZONE is quite time-consuming to follow when my fiance wants different meals than I am eating on the ZONE.)"
2,Lose weight with fewer calories,"The Zone is a calorie-restricted diet. It's not hard to lose weight when you stick to it, but I found myself fighting the urge to eat more."
5,I'm now a believer,"I read this book, although I have to admit I skipped over a lot of the ""science"" about why it works. Fruits, vegetables, lean meats? Sounded good to me. I decided to give it a try.After the first week I noticed that the mid-morning and mid-afternoon drowsies had disappeared. Completely! At that point I knew that even if I didn't lose weight I'd keep eating that way simply because I was feeling so much better. After 7 weeks of The Zone (with quite a bit of cheating here and there) I've lost 3 inches off my waist and 17 pounds. I'm still quite a ways from my goal, but I'm a big believer in The Zone. :)"
5,Finally I found out the truth about good eating.,"I am so happy to finally found the Zone diet and to have success with it. The book explained in easy-to-learn terms how our bodies work and why food should be treated like a drug. I had the hardest time losing weight dispite working out 1 1/2 hrs. a day (5 days per week), eating a low-fat high-carb diet, until I changed my diet to the Zone diet. Thanks to Barry Sears I have lost 15lbs and improved my exercise performance to running 5-6 miles a day (6 days per week) and lifting weights 3-4 times a week. Not only that but I feel incredible! (and it's only been 2 months)"
3,An easier book to understand 40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition,I returned my copies of Barry Sears books because they were so dry and boring (and I like science!). Instead I found the book written by Joyce and Gene Daoust to be more concise and easier to understand. The book is 40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition. Joyce and Gene Daoust also worked with Barry Sears.
1,Inadequate and out-of-date,"""Sears proposes consuming meals combining foods high in protein but low in saturated fats with foods composed of complex carbohydrates from fruits and vegetables, while reducing the amount of carbohydrate such as pasta, and bread.""What Sears doesn't realize is that the new terminology regarding carbohydrates has switched from ""complex"" and ""simple"" to using the glycemic index. There are many ""complex"" carbohydrates that are high on the glycemic index...the term ""complex"" is very relative. And now he's saying that pasta is not ""complex""???? Pleeeease...don't buy this book. It is inadequate and out-of-date. Sears needs to simplify this book and market it to the people who really need this type of diet, not to athletes who need higher-carbohydrate diets."
2,suspicious,"if the amount of block of protein is 7 grammes, then why is the suggested weight of a block of (skinless, fat free)chicken 27 grammes (1 oz). That is four times as much protein in the suggested meals than the blocks call for. If I am to eat 6 blocks of protein three times a day (for my height and fitness) then he has me on over a pound of chicken (or 18 egg whites, etc..) a day. I have never eaten this much protein per day in my life. And as far as my medical records show, I'm neither overweight nor unhealthy. The book is compelling, but doesn't make sense with my experience."
3,Gimmicky,"Although poorly written, I thought this book at least had some decent scientific principles to bring to bear on the question of diet and weight loss until I saw a ""The Zone"" candy bar on my drug store shelf, bought it, and couldn't even eat it the thing was so sweet. That convinced me, perhaps unfairly, that beyond obvious common sense this book is just another commercial venture designed to capitalize on the endless American ""appetite"" for gimmicky diet books and has little to offer. Then again, why should I be surprised, because there is no mystery to weight loss, it involves eating less overall, eating healthy foods and exercising. We Americans are always looking for a quick fix, some miracle diet promising we can stuff ourselves and still lose weight, but it isn't going to happen."
1,You Won't Keep It Off With This Book,I lost weight with this book and got all excited and then gained it all back! Talk about depression and grief. What a let down. Thank god for Gary Rempe's book. I finally did lose it and keep it off with Rempe's book. Don't bother with the Zone and save yourself some grief.
2,"Good principles, but . . .","This book has sound nutritional principles, but after I tried the diet, I found it to be much too restrictive, and exact. My daily food block requirements were only seven blocks, and I was always starving for something to eat, even directly after meals. The book was also extremely technical and difficult to understand for anyone short of a university degree in biology.Now I have decided to switch to the less-restrictive but still healthy Sugar Busters! lifestyle plan. I would recomment Sugar Busters! over ""The Zone"" any day."
4,Card weaving,"This book, in this form, is a bit older than I anticipated. The reason for picking this book up is so I might learn how to learn how to do Card Weaving- ie, making the decorative bands. To that end, once you ignore the information on how to make the vests (very 70's.) The info is solid. My end goal is to produce things I can wear on my Mittelalter clothing. The info provided is definitely useful towards this goal, and I can recommend it as such. Good luck."
4,It led me through beginning steps so I could actually do it.,"I wanted to try card weaving, but always got stuck during setup. This book walked me through threading in a way I could actually understand and use. The pattern drafts are appealing and easy enough for a beginner to accomplish. I got ideas for extending beyond what the book itself showed. This is a wonderful, user-friendly intro to card-weaving!"
4,Great Little How-To of a Book,"As another reviewer mentioned, Crockett's book is extraordinarily well-designed for its purpose, which is to teach the basics of card (or ""tablet"") weaving. I learned tablet weaving from this book, which comes with a set of tablet weaving cards, so the only other thing you will need to get started is some yarn. Crockett even throws in a few historical tidbits; not as many as I'd like, but some. Overall, a very good first book on the subject."
1,BEWARE - OLD INFORMATION,"This seems to be a rewrite of his earlier edtion, Beginning C. There is no mention whatsoever of the new C99 standard, etc. It looks as though they put a new cover on the book and raised the price. BAD, BAD, BAD!!!!"
2,little bang for the buck,An abridged version only 27 minuttes of a great documentary of WWII and the correspondents who became witness to the human tragedy of this momentous event. The PBS documentary was 2 hours and worth every cent; this shortened film does not do it justice. Very disappointed.
4,For a dry subject the author did a great job,"The author did a great job of writing this rather dry statistical, historical, information and I found myself fascinated. As a life-long Methodist and descendant of many, many Methodist preachers I actually learned some things I didn't know. I think all Methodists would benefit greatly by reading this book."
2,Broke after 5 days,"It's a beautiful necklace. It only has one problem. The popcorn chain is linked securely to the fixed U shaped station. I wore it every day and after the 5th day it just fell off from around my neck. There is too much pressure on those fixed connection points, and the chain just can't take it. Also, this is a completely enclosed bezel diamond, so there was really not much shine coming from it, since no light can get thru from underneath.So, if you are going to wear it here and there, it's a great choice. It's very beautiful, but if you intend to wear it every day, it's not going to work out for you.( I actually bought it when it was $225 bucks, I see the price dropped to $180. )"
4,A Must-Have For Students and the Curious,"My mom gave me this encyclopedia in college 8 years ago and wrote in it, ""Maybe this will save a few trips to the library!"" It certainly did. It has information on just about anything you want, organized by discipline. It also has pictures and maps, as well as information on living independently. It can be a little short under each topic, but that is due to the amount of information. I still use it in my teaching, though!"
4,Good book but I am still looking for more,"This book was good but I am still looking for a book for very serious Word users that want to know the limitations of Word as well as the possibilities. This book read a little too much like Word 2000 could do just about anything (this is hardly the case).I did like the sample projects at the end of each chapter. The projects were simple, applicable and illustrated some good points. I did learn many things from this book, but in developing some fairly sophistocated templates I found a lot of deficiencies or omissions with the book (eg: I thought more could be said about templates).I think this book is great for a general Word user but a Word developer needs more."
3,"Tons of great information, but 1400 pages!","Only for those who really want to go into some serious, serious depth about Word. If you don't have the time (or the strength), I'd try something like ""Just the tips, man for Microsoft Word 2000"", or even the Dummies book on the subject. Both of those, especially the first one, cut to the chase a lot more and aren't nearly as intimidating (or as expensive)."
1,Awful,"I have not heard hide nor hare from the Davidson family vendor.They advertised that they had a particular Access 2000 book, which I had ordered. Not only didn't I receive it within the time they advertise, but they haven't responded to my queries re: whether they will be able to obtain and send it or not.It is a month now from when I might have received the publication.No book nor word from them.Very disappointed. Needed this for work. Ugh."
1,"Should be titled ""Say Garbage""","Probably the worst gay fiction I have ever read. The story of a nasty, self absorbed, rude abusive bore given a child to raise in the image of himself. If I were hoping to adopt a child, I would hope that the judge had never read this sad look at gay life...How dare anyone compare it to Auntie Mame..I don't think so"
5,Charming and Hysterical,"Shaw did a wonderful job in this book. After reading it, I gave copies to all my gay friends, who love it. It carries a wide range of emotions and is highly entertaining. I think anyone who knows anyone who is gay should read this book. The characters are warm and the story line is full of surprizes. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,Warm and entertaining fantasy for Gay men.,"This book was quite enjoyable and entertaining. I found itrefreshing to find a Gay work of fiction that anyone of anyage could read. Definitely ""G"" rated, yet it held myattention and proved to be a warm and positive adventure."
5,Thick padding for strong protection.,"This case has a lot of padding and offers some strong protection, although the fit is tight at first use, it loosens to fit the laptop just right. Not recommended for screens larger than 12.1 inches -- get the larger model. Nice gray color too!"
3,Okay read....not one of Lori Foster's best!,I had to write a review on this book warning the Lori Foster fan's out there that this is not one of her typical romantic books. I liked the first half of the book and then things started repeating themselves over and over. I would recommend reading this book only if you can borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. This is not one I will keep and re-read.
3,Not her best,"Very easy book , easy plot and lovable characters but also very predictable and cliche.The story didn't keep my attention for very long and I was just happy when I finally reached the end."
3,"Another cheesy, predictable romance from Foster...","After reading ""Saving Brian"" and not quite liking it, I gave Foster a second chance as most of the reviews said it did not seem like her typical work. They were wrong! ""Unexpected"" had the same eye roll moments, where the main character is so unrealistic, the plot predictable and humor is far and few between. Foster is good at coming up with fresh and original story lines (although unrealistic) and a definite pro at writing sexual scenes. It's your modern day Harlequin romance novel so if that is your thing, this is up your alley. However, if you are into more of the chick lit scene, I suggest Janet Evanovich or Whitney Gaskell."
2,Unexpectedly ... Bad,Nothing is much unexpected about Lori Foster's latest effort and in fact the predictible plot slumps to a pool of cliche. Mercenary Ray Jean Vereker is hired by rich business whiz Eli Connor to rescue his spoiled brat of a brother Jeremy when he is captured by guerillas in Mataya. Ms. Foster expects us to believe that Ray is the manifestation of wonder-woman who chops and kick ass - taking the guerillas single-handedly with a few nasty punches. Eli is reduced to nursing the wounded heart of Ray when he finds out she bears the guilt of losing her partner in a mission. The worst part of it turns out to be when the recycled and obsolete plot device of pregnancy is used to convince readers of a happy ending. Ms. Foster clearly disappoints with this unexpectedly trite romance which offers raw sexual tension aplenty but not much of heart.
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I started reading Lori Foster 6 weeks ago and after the first book ""The Winston Brothers"" I rushed out to find any/and all of her books. Although I like the woman being the take-charge kind of person I found this booking lacking Lori drive and intensity. It won't turn me off of her books, but it could have been better."
1,Unexpectedly Bad........,"I know other reviewers used the same title for their review, but there is just no other way to say it. This book does not read like the Lori Foster we know and love. If this were my first Lori Foster novel it would be my last."
2,"I agree, not one of Lori Foster's better work.","I am sorry to say but I must agree with most of the reviewers here...""Unexpected"" was not one of Lori Foster's usual high impact and sexy piece of writing. It took me over two weeks to finish this book, when I usually read them in one sitting! I kept on hoping that going back to it later on will get me interested, but no success...What should have been a short story was stretched into a full book, it was painful to read Ray's ongoing struggles on proving herself capable in her profession, and hard to believe Eli's continual amusement at her prickiness. Will be recycling this one, folks."
2,Unexpectedly bad!,"Ms. Foster introduces several romance themes into this book, but none of them work. First, the idea of a tough female mercenary leading a daring rescue in Central America is a good idea; but Ray isn't so tough except for knowing some martial arts and the rescue isn't very dangerous. Ray and Eli just fly in, grab Eli's brother, and fly out. The only tension is sexual, wondering when and where it would finally happen. Second, we already know from the cover of the book (notice the stork) that Ray turns up pregnant, which I don't mind in a story; but it was not ""unexpected."" Third (and last), we head on out to the ranch at the end. It is too little and too late to turn this one into a Western. Sorry, but I recommend avoiding this one entirely."
5,...I really disagree with the rest of the reviews...,"This is one of my favorite Lori Foster books; the heroine rocks, and the hero is no pushover. Her charactor development is excellent. I think perhaps that the heroine is so totally self-sufficient and competent that a majority of 'romance' readership feels no kinship with her - I did. My only regret about the book is that I was stupid enough to loan my copy to my sister, and will never see it again."
2,Not one of her best efforts,"I enjoy reading Lori Foster's books, but this one was disappointing. The plot was not very deep and I never felt there was any real suspense or danger. I would prefer reading Nora Roberts or Linda Howard to this book. It was especially disappointing when the book cost over $10."
2,still waiting for the proper parts,The product was sent back for the seller to reship the proper parts. have not heard from anyone yet and its been over three weeks.
3,"Is it really ""reading workshop""?","While this book may be very useful to teachers looking for reading skill activities, it is not developed in the true style of reading workshop. This book is made up of 300+ pages of copy-ready worksheets, each addressing a particular reading skill. If you're looking for a book addressing the procedures of reading workshop, including developing group dynamics and assisting students in reading choices and developing personal reading goals, then this is not the book for you. I found the title to be misleading."
3,A Good Place to Start,"This a great book for putting together the ""mini-lesson"" portion of a reading workshop. It provides teachers with reproducible worksheets that focus on reading skills and literary elements. It gives a brief description of student and teacher responsibilities for achieving a successful workshop experience. Although there are many useful tips, and the literary element section of this book is outstanding, it does not provide teachers with activities for incorporating critical thinking and it leaves the reader wanting strategies for establishing student-directed learning. A brief section on integrating different reader responsibilities, and a plan for setting up a workable management system to handle the flow of papers, portfolios, and reading response journals would make this book better."
3,Loved the setting!,"Eve Hamilton, fashion designer and Professor Theophilus de Cordova, plant physiologist, get involved because Eve is trying to find out the details of her brother's murder. Trust issues arise because Eve steals a very valuable formula that can have disastrous results if it falls into the wrong hands.Ms Icilyn's current novel is sometimes difficult to follow. The main characters and some secondary ones are interesting as is the setting - London, Scotland, and Vienna."
4,An intriguing look at two damaged souls,"The book, writen by two authors, works surprising well. The email exchanges seem quite real. Markoe's dialoge is a bit stilted. But, her internal thoughts work well. Prieboy writes extremely well. YOu completely feel for these characters and their abusive pasts. It is a actually optimistic book and off the beaten path romance. A really great read."
2,Not the Best,"I'm a big fan of Merrill Markoe and her writing, but this left me cold. While I enjoyed reading it, part of the fun was trying to guess who the characters are in real life. Yes, it sent me looking for Wall of Voodoo's back catalog and Markoe's other (nonfoction) writing but the ending left me cold and the characters seemed poorly developed. The quirks (like her artistic endeavors with recipe cards) were what kept me going. Try her earlier nonfiction stuff, it doesn't disappoint."
4,"Fast, fun read","This was a fast, fun read. Grant and Lisa, the two main characters, are likable and engaging, and their back and forth email repartee turns into a contest to see who has the most insane ex. I sped so quickly through it that I guess it was inevitable I be disappointed with the ending. It seemed tacked on (and if you don't want a spoiler, please skip this part), as if Winnie and Grant broke up so that Lisa could enter Grant's life. The revelation of Winnie's infidelity doesn't jive, as she and Grant are presented as a happy couple who get along well with each other. As Grant details Winnie's flaws, making her into yet another psycho ex, Lisa is able to take her place. But for the most part, the book is a fun read."
5,Yikes. Its my Life.,I never related to characters more strongly than I did to those in Psycho Ex GAme. I am embarrassed to admit this is the story of my life.Once I started reading I couldnt stop.THen I bought copies for all my friends.
3,It was alright.,"I'm the type that can't part ways with the books I read, so I buy every book I read. That said, I was at the bookstore with my daughter for story time and was a little broke but really was itching to read something. I got the hard cover on clearance for 5 bucks. No wonder it was on clearance. The story was a little flat and not very well written. It was definitely lacking a climax, and even significant things that happened in their lives seemed insignificant due to the way it was written, or maybe it was because the characters were lacking substance. It was a good idea, but the story itself was just ho-hum. The reason for my three stars is simply because I was able to finish it. It's not an excruciating read, I just think they could have done better."
2,2 stars because I actually finished it,"This could have been a good book. It's a good idea, and I did enjoy the shifting points of view with each chapter. I *did* like Lisa's hobby of collecting out of date recipe cards and making them into faces. Some of the better faces made me laugh out loud.However, I felt like the email conversations went on entirely too long and after a while I felt like they were all the same. I also didn't care for how every email started ""Dear Lisa/Grant."" I know that's picky, but if this is meant to mimic how people communicate now through email it should have been a little more consistent with how people actually send emails and less like formal letters. Though, maybe that formal letter feeling is meant to invoke the idea of love letters they weren't sending each other. In any case, it felt whiny and sort of flat, and when I put it down I said ""blech."""
2,Found it on the bargain table...,"And now I know why. It wasn't a horrible book, but it just couldn't keep me interested. I didn't LIKE the characters and I couldn't connect with them in any way. Some of the psycho ex stories were entertaining but most of them were just flat out scary. Maybe I've lived a sheltered life?"
5,Couldn't put it down,THe book was great fun from beginning to end. It takes you on a witty engagaing crazy ride through the world of dysfunctional relationships that certainly hit close to home . And I liked how it was written in two voices. You get a look at the difference between how men and women see this stuff. I really enjoyed it.
3,"Twisted Up in Arizona, Where the Hippies Have Retired, Still Smokin'","the Sun City Cannabis Club tries very hard to leave no stone unturned, and no weed unburned. While generally a lively read, it suffers from lack of editing, and from peddling every conspiracy theory the author(s) could lay their hands upon.The books could have benefited more focus on the central plots and characters, less emphasis on the religious/spiritual angle, and a bit less of the conspiracies. In my opinion this aspect mostly distracts from an otherwise engaging read. A good editor would have told the author to trim, trim, trim. This could have been a great read, as it is it's only passably good.So fire one up and relax with it, forget about the inconsistencies, and enjoy some reefer with the old heads in Sun City, AZ."
5,The Sun City Cannabis Club,"Great read! We all have a ""Faye"" in our families. Very enjoyable book placing you on the edge of your seat to laughter.Thank you!"
2,so-so,"Really didn't grab me. The author takes us on a whirlwind tour of West Point, but I was never really captivated. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't recommend this book"
1,Absolutely awful,"The structure of this book was absolutely awful. The content even worse. This book has no storyline and jumps around from ""heavy"" army discussion to daily West Point tripe. The photos look like they were taken by a 1st grader. In summary, this book offers nothing of value."
1,so-so,"Really didn't grab me. The author takes us on a whirlwind tour of West Point, but I was never really cartivated. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,Well worth reading if you have any interest in West Point,"I found this to be a good, solid effort that achieved the goal of describing the current way of life at West Point. The writing was good, not great and the organization was the same. It was definitely worth reading, but not quite a five star book in my opinion.If you're interested in West Point at all, read this. It clearly tells how the Army has changed the system at USMA, and made it easier for plebes to survive, but doesn't explore the pros and cons of these changes in very much depth. It selects certain cadets to track through the year, but doesn't really get the reader close to them. In other words, this good book could have been a great book with some better, or luckier, choices of cadet subjects and presentation style. Still, I'd gladly read another effort by this author on any topic I have an interest in pursuing."
5,Trust me.,"I've played this CD for literally thousands of Chicago area high school kids over the years. Of all the music I play in my classroom, this gets the best response. The first time a class hears it, inevitably the 2 or 3 most interesting kids in the room ask who it is. No matter whether they're going to Yale next year, or going to junior college, whether they grew up on hip-hop or metal, whether they're white, black, or latino -- IT DOESN'T MATTER. The music hounds are ALWAYS interested in this disc. The version with the guy on the cover (the one WITH vocals) isn't NEARLY as good. This is great music for when people are just showing up at your party, for studying, for reading the New York Times, or of course, for making love to your old lady. Buy it for yourself, or buy it for someone cooler than you who thinks you're a square. Abjure disappointment. Trust me."
2,"I like Dan, but...","I like Dan the Automator as much as anybody, but this album doesn't get it for me. I love that he's one of the few artists who thinks his music is as important to his hop-hop-ish offerings as the lyricists that they warrant instrumental releases, but most of these beats and tones just don't sing on their own. Not anywhere near as solid an offering as his ""Dr. Octagon: Instrumentalyst"" record, or the stripped-down ""Deltron"" (which actually sounds better without the vocals). The music just isn't hitting."
4,Nothing To See Here,"This one gets my standard short spiel for routine or ""everyday"" orders that simply function as advertised: This item satisfied my requirements and/or ""worked"" as it was supposed to. It presented no apparent defects, nor did it significantly exceed my expectations. As a result, I offer this item 4 stars (a.k.a. ""I Like It"")."
5,Just what I needed,to complet the table tennis table I got my grand children for Christmas. I received it within 3 days. It was well packed and very easy to set up. Just the size for my area.
5,Great Guide Book,"I live on Oahu, and this guidebook is great! I send a copy to friends and family a few months before they come for a visit, so they can pick what they want to do when they get here. This book gives them just about as much information as anyone can get.The maps work great and show all of the roads. The inside info on the different beaches and places to surf or which beach to take the small children to are all in there, along with any other water activity. The pictures are great and the location of the camera taking the picture is on the adjacent map, which really can give a sense of scale to the map and identity to the picture."
1,Please don't buy this revised edition,"I waited a while to receive this newly revised edition, which is certainly a big disappointment! The book filled with many old photos from 50 or 60 years ago and looked like a history book instead of a tour guide book. Overall the photos in this book are not impressive and you can get them from many other resources. The other thing I want to mention is the printing quality of this book was really awful, and the colors were not accurate and images were fuzzy. Compared to the previous edition, this one is definitely a setback. If you need a useful and updated Oahu tour guide book, you can consider Oahu Revealed."
4,Driving & Discovering Oahu,Great book. Preparing ahead of time for our trip at end of month and this book has come in handy prior to going.
5,"Aloha, Hawaii !!","Very good for someone who wants to be sure they see everything and know what they are seeing. Beautiful pictures. Good maps. Size of book is a little cumbersome; but overall, well worth having as a directory and as a remembrance of your trip."
5,great cd,"this cd is a real hit, i hope to hear it on the radio soon and i hope that this cd really hits it big. clay huston has been dedicated for a long time to producing the best cd to his ability and this is the one, trust me i have heard them all!! help him to go big time!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A wholesome perspective of Louisa May Alcott's personal life,"The authors of this book present a charming perspective of how Louisa May Alcott's personal life paralled many of the story lines in Little Women. They paint a detailed picture of the day to day activities which were necessary to maintain a certain standard of living in the late 1800's. After reading this Treasury of Little Women, one gets the impression what Louisa May Alcott missed in real life, she made for herself in Little Women. The authors provide recipes from that timeframe and instructions for sewing projects and such which were described in Little Women. Even if one has no desire to use the recipes or instructions, it is quite interesting to read the ingredients used back then and methods for doing things the old-fashioned way -- by hand. Reading this book was a nice get-a-way from the problems of today."
5,Great heater,"Took this heater camping & it got down to 35, heater worked great in a short time. Was in a 4 person tent"
4,coleman heater,the heater works great but gets much hotter to touch than expected so we have to be super careful when placeing it due to our crawler baby
3,Heater???,"I used this for the first time at a Dog Agility Trial. It was so cold inside that any kind of heat was welcomed. I call this heater ""my pricey hand warmer."" I like the size, ease of use, and push button start, but it projects a radiant heat. You have to be on top of it to feel the warmth. I have since bought another, ""Mr.Heater,BigBuddy."" It has a fan w/several settings. That's the one I recommend."
3,coleman blackcat catalytic heater,"Product is of good physical size, practical, convenient and easy to operate. Heating capacity was however deemed insufficient for an volume of less than 100 cu. ft. Also, contrary to Coleman's indication, the heater does not operate 10 hrs. per propane tank. Delivery from order to receipt was excellent from Amazon.com. Regular updates on package status were also provided."
4,Nice heater just not in wind.,"We bought this heater to use for tailgating at football games. We eventually will also use it when we go camping but have not yet. The heater works great. The instant start is easy to use and lights up pretty quickly. Heater takes a few minutes to get warm but does get really warm. If there is any wind the heater will be a lot less effective as the wind will skim all the heat right off he heater and the only way to really feel it is to be almost touching it. It does its job, though."
1,Damn thing never worked!!!,I don't like writing reviews because it seems like it is wasting my time but I gotta let people know about this product. Igniter switch never works!!! I was out on freezing cold and tried to turn this thing on for hours and it did not work until I found someone with match at 2am. Do not buy this if you are not going to bring something to start the fire.
3,Coleman Perfec Temp camping heater,I bought this for my camping trip but did not use it....it was way too bulky tho. I did not have the chance to use it.
4,MAKE SURE YOU BRING MATCHES,This is a great product kept my tent warm down to 0 degrees it started great when first opened at home and tried it home before heading out. But after that I could see the spark so that was working but the electric start did not start the unite. Started just fine with a match Will keep the unit and try to figure out why later why the electric start does not work
3,gone caming with BlackCat,"I received this as a Christmas Gift. I wanted one for cold, camping, mornings. So far, the heater does not put out the heat my old reflector style heater does. I do find this heater to be more like a radiator. Under certain circumstances I can see this will be very useful. The BlackCat only throws heat out a foot in cold mornings and about 3 feet above, but if you are in a half dome shelter, this type of heat is perfect. I need to test this item a little more this winter. So far a 3 rating, with a chance for a 4 once I find a better way of using the BlackCat."
4,Works well,"It gets quite hot and fast, nice little heater. I pre-burned mine before setting out but it does have a tiny bit of smell to it. It is a lifesaver when it gets cold, especially with these new tent designs with the screen tops and a thin fly. Cold weather pours in. This helps combat that. The only issue we had is lighting it. I resorted to a lighter and even then you were not sure when it lit. Once lit, it stayed hot for a long time."
5,Works well!,Pros:- Heats up really fast and runs really hot.- Runs for a really long time.- Has been WONDERFUL to have in my tent on winter camps! (although I would never leave it running while I'm sleeping.... I worry about it getting bumped and starting my tent or sleeping bag on fire... or melting my tent)Cons:- Takes too many button pushes to start (I found it easier to bring a lighter)- The top edge runs REALLY HOT and I burned myself pretty good
3,LPN Notes,"The condition of this book was not in how the seller described it. It was very used, faded and has name and address labels stuck in it. I was rather disappointed in the quality that I received. The information in the book will be very useful though."
5,bought as a gift for my wife when she was a nursing student,"She said it is very useful and helpful. She appreciated it, and said it makes things a lot easier having a quick reference that can be carried in her. pocket"
4,"Some Diagram Flaws, But very good nonetheless","Indeed, the first diagram has a flaw, as there is no knight on F6 as the narrative suggests. I found a few other flaws in the book, but as far as most chess books go, I found this to be better than many I have read. Why do so many chess books have mistakes like this? Who does the editing? Maybe the editors don't know how to play chess.In spite of the first diagram being flawed, I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot from it. In case you don't know, it focuses exclusively on double king pawn openings, which are worth an entire book of study unto themselves in my opinion.One of the things I really like about this book is the glossary, as well as two indices for the 202 situations diagrammed in the book - a tactical index and an opening index."
2,Terrible book,"Avoid this one....It's a very basic book aimed at low level players, showing a range of the e4-e5 openings. In each example, it follows the standard opening, then one side makes an error (Usually suicidal in nature.) allowing the opposition to mate or at least obtain an overwhelming advantage in the next 1-2 moves. Pandolfini gives the instruction on how to do this.As mentioned by everyone else the book is packed with errors, i.e. diagram 1, the black knight f6 is missing, diagram 149 white has 3 rooks etc... the list goes on and on.You will spend you time wondering why a) someone would make that error and b) why you wasted money on the book.i gave it 2 stars, because its cheap, the advice is reasonable and it does show various patterns, within the openings. It's a nice idea for a book, its just this one is terribly done. dont waste your money"
3,Still looking for a really good book on opening traps,"Something is really lacking out there. A good book that covers in detail the ideas behind the most important themes found in chess traps. A book with a good number of diagrams that uses learning the opening with good quality accurate analysis.This book, though ok, doesn't fit the bill - nor as of this date have I found such a book (Chernev's Winning Chess Traps is outdated and has limited explanations and lots of mistakes).Pandolfini's attempt to fill the void here has mostly failed. Not enough explanation along with this being more of ""here is the positions and solve it"". You can get that from many simple tactics books.However, nontheless this book does have its good points. It provides practical trap problems that occur in real games - a few forgivable inaccuracies and typos - but that is ok!"
2,"CHESS TRAP BOOKS ARE GOOD - - This one has some flaws, but does cover a lot of traps","If you learn chess traps from the prospective of not trying to set up cheapo traps by using inferior moves then you are on the right track. Traps will teach you the tactical parts of the openings and help you learn the openings.I was rather diapointed when there were moves that were played that were very weak and the book doesn't tell you why or show you what should have been done. There is little analysis in the book, and when it is given it is usually well into the game where the trap is being used - too late to know how to avoid it and where did the player go wrong and why is not covered!There are some serious mistakes in the analysis in several traps. There one good point - there are a lot of traps covered, but you are largely on your own to figure things out."
2,Some Unrealistic Examples,"A number of the examples require your opponent to make such a bad move that the situation is unlikely to happen; or if he's that weak, you would likely win anyway without studying the book. Some of the examples are useful as real traps that can occur. The well known Petroff's Defence trap for instance. The examples are given 1 per page in classic Pandolfini style which makes each idea easy to study. One may find the attacking tactics, especially how to spot a weakness useful. This book involves an number of the most popular e pawn openings only."
1,time reading this is tme lost for life,This was written more for a fast buck than as a teaching tool. Don't waste your time or money. Enough said.
3,It Is a ok Book,"This book is, how can i put it......... well its only ok. All the openings are e4. Nothing else. That surprised me. It gives each opening as a chart with 1 paragrah to explain it. If you are looking for indepth anylasis this is not the book for you."
1,Takes advantage of naive but well meaning amateurs...,"The problem with these books is that they are tailored to what beginers think they should know,and not what they really do need to learn. As a beginer,I to was initialy enamoured with this series-but looking back now as a more experienced player, I believe the author is most likely more interested in churning out low quality books than in improving the novice players game."
2,Not very helpful,"Personally I found this book to be of very little help in improving my chess game. The author targets the book for beginners and writes it in an attempt to teach them how to aviod opening blunders and how to capitolize on your enemies mistakes. The only problem is, the book's examples are way too specific and each example is full of terrible moves. Every chess game played has a mistake or two, but in this book the author points out opening games where in 10 moves or less a handful of mistakes have already taken place. The bottom line for this book is, its too simple for advanced players and too specific to help beginners."
3,"Decent book in theory, but tons of typos","This is not a bad book for getting an intro to double king's pawn openings. But it doesn't state this limited focus on the cover, which I find misleading. The thing that bothers me most about this book is the number of typos. I'm halfway through and have encountered at least half a dozen errors where the moves listed are obviously incorrect (either impossible or don't match the resulting diagram), which is very frustrating."
3,Frustrating to study: numerous typos and erroneous diagrams.,"I'd barely recommend this book and its sequel, More Traps and Zaps. Each ""trap"" is presented as a board diagram that the reader is to solve. I soon became frustrated because many of the diagrams are erroneous, as are the corresponding move lists and, in some cases, solutions. After about 5 such occurrences, I no longer knew whether I was having trouble solving the problem, or whether the problem was insoluble because the given diagram was wrong again. Pandolfini is a great teacher, but he needs an editor like nobody's business."
3,Go see him when you get the chance.,Pretty good DVD of a guy who is even better in real life and off your TV or computer screen.
3,I'm I the only one,I'm I the only one that noticed how stoned he was thru the show?I got Elliot Smith flashbacks. :^(
2,Very very slow !!,I bought one of the XtraDrive for CompactFlash. Thought it is fast enough to copy my photos. Actually sometimes I wait more than ONE hour to copy 60 or 70 photos!!Beaware if you have greater expectations.
1,One time wonder,It worked the first time I used it.Haven't been able to use it since.Try something else.Has a pretty blue light.
4,"Excellent, diverse collection","Varcoe has an extremely musical, light bass voice which is quite appropiate to this repertory, and a SUPERB command of French.With such good basic ingredients, and a rich selection of interesting, often lovely, songs, this is a highly recommendable disk dealing with an area of music that has not often been fortunate on recording. The pianist is very good.Good sound, full texts and translations. Bravo!"
5,Fabulous!,"While not the typical fun and high spirits that predominate his previous albums (especially The Celtic Folks Vol I, II, III, IV), this album still has a heart. Alot of heart. Obviously, Danny has poured even more of his heart and melancholy into the music here than on previous albums -- and the heart that he puts into the music is what brings him far above the other Irish musicians. I can only hope that the first three volumes of the Celtic Folk also make it to Amazon(my old cassette versions have worn out over the last few decades). To put the music into perspective, when my ""Celtic Folks Volume I"" first quit working, I drove 16 hours to O'Flaherty's pub to buy a replacement (only to find out that the pub's store was currently sold out). If you like Irish music, there is nothing more authentic than Danny O'Flaherty. From the typical high spirited drinking songs to the Irish ballads, he does them all with a flair that I have never heard from any other artist."
1,this is not round tubing,the ad is incorect Pls90102 TB-2 is not round tubing but coated wire. however that does not mean that it is not useful
1,Can't go lower than 1 star ?,"My parents bought this TV and here is my fathers' review :This TV failed in less than a year. Warranty service from the dealer, the Canadian head office and the Oklahoma headquarters is terrible. The response time to get a technician to look at it was over two weeks. You get to tell the story multiple times anytime you call either of the headquarters. They do not record anything, but listen intently and hope you go away. Their phone numbers for Customer Service are well hidden and you have to pay for each call. The low rating is for exceptionally poor response under the factory warranty. I am still waiting for nearly a month for parts."
4,Monster Blood 3(Personally I give it a 4.2),"Better than the 2nd thats for sure! But you know what they say the first one is the best of them all. Summary:Evan can't stand baby-sitting his not-so genius cousin,Kermit.Kermit refuses do to anything not even play!All he wants to do is mix things in his little lab in the basement and play pratical jokes on Evan and Andy.But Andy and Evan has something to get him back. And Andy has just the thing............MONSTER BLOOD!!!!"
5,Monster Blood 3,Monster Blood 3 is a must read book. If you like scary books you must read this book. I like this book because I like all of R.L Stine's books.Evan wants to show that his cousin Kermit isn't all that smart. So Evan goes and gets some monster blood. Evan accidentally swallowed some monster blood. This makes Evan grow as tall has a house! He is chased by the police and they think he is an alien. Evan must find a way to get small again.If you like or read Monster Blood 1 or Monster Blood 2 you must read this book! Also if you like R.L Stines other book then you will want to read this book. This book is scary but not too scary. This is the best R.L Stine book I have ever read. This book is temping to find out what happened next.
3,Interesting! By MJ from North Boulevard,"The book I am reviewing is Monster Blood III, written by R.L. Stine. I think this book deserves three stars. It's okay because Evan grew taller which was cool, but it talked about the same stuff happening over and over again. The book is about a boy named Evan (the main character) who has to baby sit his cousin Kermit, a genius. A problem that occurs in the story is that Kermit makes a mixture that gets Evan to accidentally grow really tall. This problem is solved when Kermit makes another mixture that gets Evan to shrink back to his normal size. I'd recommend this book to boys ages 7 and over since it's kind of scary. Other books by this author include Shocker on Shock Street and Monster Blood and Monster Blood II."
4,The Blood Begins To Grow On You.,Now it's Evan's turn to grow. Only this time the Blood is creating havoc worse than it did in the last two.
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE BEST GOOSEBUMPS I HAVE EVER READ. FIRST TRIGGER GROWS THEN THE HAMSTER GROWS BUT THIS TIME THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.EVAN GROWS..GROWS..GROWS...AND GROWS VERY TALL.THIS BOOK IS VERY SCARY AND INTERESTING.I RECOMMEND TO READ THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE WHO IS A GOOSEBUMP FAN ,LIKE ME."
1,Installation directions say this can NOT be installed above a shower,"Contrary to what the Hunter web page says for this fan, the installation directions for this fan say this fan should NOT be installed above a shower and must be installed at least three feet away."
5,A Must Have for any Writer,"My aunt bought this book for me as a gift and I have used it almost daily in my profession. The book is organized well and has listings of publications and publishers that are not found in other guides. It is easy to read and includes a wealth of information including pay rate, tips, and special needs. At the back of the book, it also includes workshops and conference listings. A must have for any writer!"
5,Among the finest sets of the Brahms symphonies,"Lorin Maazel is not associated with Brahms the way he is with, say, Mahler or Russian composers. But in the mid-1970s he led the Cleveland Orchestra (of which he was then music director) in this series, originally released on LP by Decca. Apparently Decca associated Maazel's then-labelmate Georg Solti with Brahms--and only Solti with Brahms, because aside from a release in Japan, Decca never bothered to ""silver"" this series, instead licensing it to a small reissue label known as Scribendum. I'm here to tell you this set excels Solti's, fine though that is, and ranks with the best. From Maazel you get clean-lined, unmannered Brahms that emphasizes clarity over lushness; from the Cleveland Orchestra you get the burnished sound these scores demand; and thanks to both the original Decca recording engineers and the Scribendum team who remastered the LPs for CD you get sonics that are difficult to surpass."
1,Not ready for prime time,"Issues with this product when used with a Mistubishi TV and OTA reception.1. Stops recording2. Misses recordings3. Thinks there is a connection to TV when there is not one4. Date time stamp incorrect for recordingsIt is frustrating to use, because it does not work properly often. Then there are times it works as it should.Technical issues aside, if you looking for TIVO or ReplayTV functionality, this is not for you. This is simple functionality similiar to a VCR, just no tapes and a hard drive instead. And there is limited capacity for HDTV only 9 hours.I am waiting for a replacement unit from RCA to see if the technical issues are limited to my unit or if there is a general unreliability problem with this product.If this product worked, it would be a stop gap until other products are on the market at a reasonable price."
2,"Good concept, but didn't work for me.","This product seems like just the ticket for HD recording if you have a firewire-equipped television with an integrated ATSC tuner. Unfortunately, I paired the unit with a Samsung HL-R7178W and had no luck.From reading all the literature, they seemed like a good match, but the TV would not take control of the box.My recommendation would be to buy this ONLY if you have the recommended RCA television. Anything else would be hit-or-miss."
1,nathaniel bombs this time,"Everyone seems to love this album, but I think it's garbage. Don't get me wrong, Dan the Automator is one of the figures I respect most in music today, but this album fell flat. The songs aren't catchy enough to be good pop, not funky enough for hip hop. The cheese overshadows any mood this album could have created, c'mon those lyrics are wretched, admit it. Perhaps Nathaniel ventured into territory he didn't know quite as well, and it showed. A great idea, but I think portishead already made the album this one could have been.I returned this one to amoeba and picked up a copy of Mahalia Jackson's greatest hits on columbia, I suggest skipping lovage and going straight to mahalia."
2,sleepytime music,"This album should be called ""MUSIC TO CHILL OUT AND SMOKE A BLUNT TO"" cuz it makes me wanna light one up and go to sleep. If they wanted to make music to make love to, then they should've tried something R Kelly-ish. I would love to hear Mike Patton sing an R Kelly song, preferably ""Your body's calling"" or ""Honey Love"". I think with Mike's voice, he could do some good R&B songs. I listen to all kinds of music except country but can't get into this album as much as I ""hoped I would""."
1,STOLEN MATERIAL,"""Tea Time With Maseo"" in this album contains recordings and words stolen from Alan Lorber's 1969 Groupies album."
3,Joke's on Me,"I saw this album on a list of the ""trip hop"" genre. The cover is obviously a joke, but when I listenned to a few samples, I thought it was just a mask over good music. The music IS good. Especially on tracks ""To Catch a Thief"", ""Book of the Month"", and ""Strangers On A Train"". However, now that I've listenned to the lyrics, I see that they are laughable, just like the cover. The album is revolutionary in that it is a satire of Trip Hop music. It is the Spinal Tap of Trip Hop music. I can see how Mike Patton fans would love it. I think Portishead and Goldfrapp fans may be disappointed."
4,great album Horrible! cover art...,"the album is great, but wtf ... horrible cover art... a copy or other horrible cover art by serge g. but well the music is great! buy it if you can pay around $50 because is out of print..."
2,dan the automator back with more of the same,"this album is quite a disappointment from dan's work on deltron 3030, gorillaz, and handsome boy modelling school. continuing on a great concept, the future of handsome boy modelling school might be in jeopardy. dan is trying to flex his stuff and follow-up with the jazzy and sexy note we remember from 'the truth' and 'sunshine' from handsome boy modelling school, we see an album that takes this concept, and uses way too many annoying vocals to complement the standard, which is to say expected, beats from dan. unfortunately, this seems like more of the same from the automator."
2,More corny then horny,"Something makes this hip-hop inflected, sexual electronica grow more stale every year. Patton fans might consider this amongst his weakest work, and the whole thing just reeks of a faux-edge that is not there musically or lyrically. Things are kept at bay with semi-interesting sampling and light interludes, but it hardly reaches past novelty with vacant vocals and plodding production."
5,"Great Songs, Great Style","I've always been a Patton's fan, and this is one of the finest works I've ever heard about him, it's a soft-progressive-rock ballad with a little touch of irony, it's a very nice piece of art, a masterpiece, indeed."
4,new automator,"Just when you thought he was riding the mainstream wagon of success with the gorillaz, Automator delivers yet another solid album. The beats are good and the cheesy french accents are amusing as are the skits with Maseo and bambaataa. Highlights include the intro with Prince Paul, (ain't no sheer extascy till you try music to make love to your old lady by) stroker ace, to catch a thief, sex (i'm a), the mellow ""lies and alibis"", and everyone has a summer they want to remember avec kid koala. (...)"
4,Really Grows on You ... it's Good ...,"I have to admit that when I first reveived this album I wasn't immediately in love with the Lovage. It's not sexy in the style of Maxwell or other soulful pimps (not that it's supposed to be!) but rather it's more of a raunchy/dirty sound with loops.After listening to this for a while though it's become one of my favorite albums (the true measure of a good record ... gets better with time and not tired!). I have some of Jennifer Charles' Elysium Fields stuff but I haven't heard her sound as good as she does on this record ... this sultry/sexy genre is definitely her cup of tea. There are 6 songs on this album that I really love (Pit Stop/Thief/Strangers/Anger Management/Stroker Ace/Lifeboat) ... how many records can I say that about? Not many. At first my big complaint was that I wanted a lot more of Charles and a lot less of Patton ... but I've even come to like his parts a lot more as well. Like I said, it really grows on you."
5,re-release of a modern classic!,"Heard a few years ago that my copy of Lovage was hard to come by as they stopped releasing it. Never checked into that but guess it was true if they're re-releasing it now. Dan the Automator is pure gold on this bad boy! Smooth beats and sexy vocals... perfect casting of Patton and whoever the woman singer is (sorry).Remember, if you're in the mood for something a little more explicit: 2 parts brandy to 1 part Lovage. Enjoy baby!"
5,"1 part portishead, 2 parts automater, and a pinch of patton","The album had me at ""hello""...although i loathe the term ""trip-hop"" this is probably the best example ever...combines funk, jazz, hip-hop and electronica for a powerful mix. I happen to be a big patton fan, but even the instrumental tracks are outstanding. Top of my list of recommendations"
4,Sensual and Unique CD,"I enjoy a variety of music and really am intrigued by most of the songs on this CD. What enticed me to order the CD was hearing ""Stroker Ace"" while enjoying wine and candles - with a friend of course. It is a combination of soul, sex and light jazz! Truly sensual"
5,Love the Lovage,This Cd is amazing i have been listening to it non stop for the past 5 years. I dont go a week without it.
4,A wonderful book!,"On Priscilla's planet, which is not so far away, the sky is a purple, green-brownish gray hue today. The sky had not been blue for days. Then the raindrops began to fall and rain became the word of the day.Priscilla is not a fish or a duck so rain is bad luck. She tried to occupy herself indoors but became bored until she decides to go outside and perform a rain-stopping dance. Near the woods she encounters the pixie Posy from The Land of Primrose.Posy is happy that Priscilla enjoys the rain. But no, Priscilla states that ""this rain is the pits."" Posy educates Priscilla about the wonders of rain and suddenly Posy happily begins to see things in a new way.This is a lyrical story with rhyming verse that will delight children. The whimsical illustrations will bring little bursts of laughter as they enjoy rainy days in a new way.Armchair Interviews says: When rainy days plague your children, it's time to read to them. I suggest reading Priscilla and the Splish-Splash Surprise."
2,Man on the Eiffel Tower,"The film was too old to appreciate, missing one of the most suspenseful moments in film: when Franchot Tone and Charles Laughton are in a restaurant. Many candles, are burning so you are aware of fire, the violins are playing the Rumanian Rhapsody and Tone is downing shots of vodka- all building up to the climb on the Eiffel Tower. Such a shame."
5,The Truth in Fiction Form,"The Book had to be called fiction because of the facts were passed down from those that went through them and/or family members of those that went through the Trail Of Tears.I too found the inhabitants of each page,real and breathtakenly real.I am of Cherokee descent and what Frank has written in living words are true.I would love to see this in movie form. I think it should be in every school accross the country and especially in reservation schools because so many of these schools are just given enough material to learn the basics and this book is full of living history and all people of all ages should read it and maybe others will do as I have done and contact any and all that might produce this as a movie and get this informative and eye opening book into every educational field possible.Thank you Frank StewartShalomSeluGracie Miller"
2,Disney Makes More Money Selling Cliched Fantasy,Positives:(1.) Disney uses films' 70 year old time worn formula of selling fantasy princess cuteness world to girls under 16 to make Disney more money.(2.) Use lots of cute people doing a lot of shopping acting dumb & mean (to provide something that resembles a conflict so we can have a story).(3.) Being decent always wins in Disney World & mean people disappear.Negatives:(1.) Disney TV/movies (and other studios) have a greater educational impact than schools and family.(2.) Disney audience will grow up unthinking in cliches & stereotypes which are as realistic as fantasy princess world.
1,This is NOT TV-G; it's PG-13,This is NOT TV-G; it's PG-13. I watched this movie with my 6 year old and it's definitely a TEEEEEEENAGE movie. I can't believe it was rated TV-G 7+ please email disney and the studios and MPAA and let them know. I'm not one of these people that typically cares about ratings but this movie is way off base.
4,Hook me up Eek-Eek-Eek!,"If you don't feel the first song, you'll never feel the Mouse! There is such a broad range of music on this cd. Hardcore, party, retro, and comical jams. Oh yeah! He even has some positive messages to get across. If you get a chance, go see him live to feel the vibe, but just don't pass out like I did(I had too much smoke inhilation from the atmosphere(cigarette that is)and had to be carried outside to get some H2o by my potna Milk) That was at the Filmoe in Frisco in about '96 and is a true story by the way. So just ""Leave Your Parents Smoke Alone"" and enjoy this cd @ 420 Eeek 'Um out!"
3,Too expensive but i love the product,"It is very reliable and easy to use during travel and to fix imperfections made by your clumsiness after a visit to get a manicure done, but as you can see a price like that doesn't justify 6 acetone soaked pads. Definitely not for everyday use but only in emergencies."
3,"Correct, but lacks sparkle.","After listening this disc we can say ""It's ok"". Every song is sung in a exact pitch and clear beat in every part, and is conducted in a correct tempo, but alas, it lacks sparkle. And this is crucial! Just listene to the ""Agnus Dei"" of Barber here, It is so rigid and constrained, even sound a bit wooden. It happens in Bernstein's Chichester Psalms too. This is a good disk for students major in conducting. He can learn from here how to make every part of a chorus sound clear. But never try to learn any interpretation about music here."
4,Well-crafted psychological techno-thriller,"It's sometime in the 21st century, and humanity is in trouble. Runaway greenhouse effect has ravaged the world, sending starving Arab armies into the heart of Europe while the United States faces chaos as the breadbasket dries up and blows away. Against this background appear the Blue Woofers: mysterious lights that may or may not be alien visitors. They're thoroughly inscrutable, but they do seem to be interested in observing human beings under conditions of extreme stress... This is a very solid first novel, with alien aliens, well-crafted battle scenes, and taut psychological suspense. I do have some quibbles (some of the subplots are really extraneous) but overall this is well worth a look"
2,What the heck is this ???!?!,"Well, there are many things wrong with this book. The major one is that the characterizations are totally unbelievable. Very lttle of the motivations are explained, and the random way that the male characters all start shedding tears was rather strange. Not to mention the ""S"" in SF is rather weak too. I can't believe I actually spent money on this piece of trash."
3,fine,It works alright. The plastic is a little brittle so take care when traveling. I've already broken and fixed mine... but it was from my own rough handling. Charges fast.
4,I would recommend this product,"I used this product today on my mom's honda accord I was skeptical but it does work, it left a little less than a cupful of oil in the bottom of the tank. I would recommend that before you use it for the first time you drain your oil and keep up with the oil changing since it does leave a little in the engine. If you keep up with your oil changes then I think the pump will be all you need, no more on your back under the car again. I would recommend this product"
4,Great pump,"I wiish I had a larger model. I used this for my mercedes and it has 7 litres. The pump only holds 4.The neat automatic stop feature kept the pump from overfilling, so I poured the oil into a container and started again.Very easy. I did trim the end of the hose with a small notch to keep the end from going flush against the pan and stopping the suction."
1,No suction for me,I tried and tried to get suction and could not. I duck-taped the hose connections with no results. This product just does not work for me. . .
4,Beautiful!,"I think that Edith Piaf is 'la creme de la creme,' and I love the passion she uses when singing. It's incredible, yet very raw. Her husky voice always gets me, and the balls she had to have to sing about what she did when she did."
1,A mine of misinformation,This book would have benefited from careful proof reading. The are many examples of incorrect captions and diagrams with crucial information absent. If the publishers are not willing to at least include an errata sheet this book could be a disaster for the novice!
3,"Brilliant album, frustrating DVD","When this album first came out in 1993 I remember thinking ""gosh this isn't something I'm going to return to very often."" Now 15 years later I can say it's emerged as one of my favorite Elvis Costello albums though not typical for his material, except perhaps for the biting lyrics. This DVD however is quite frustrating. It opens with Elvis addressing a live audience and one assumes it will be a presentation of a live concert, however most all of the music here is mimed to the recordings on a set giving the presentation a very stagy and artificial feel. It works ok as a documentary and given that it's worth watching but there's really no ""performance"" here one can't simply listen to on the recording."
5,Music and sarcassim at it's best,"The Brodsky Quartet is wonderful to listen to, and perfectly recorded.The CD is for lovers of classical music and humor.If you have no love of sarcasm, then do not buy the album.The letters were written by The Brodsky Quartet and Elvis Costello who's real name is Declan MacManus.You will laugh while enjoying the wonderful music."
2,Elvis Costello & the Brodsky Quartet,I have not received this item. I got a message that the state of this product was too bad and that it would not been send to me.I wasn't offered another possibility of this item.
3,Flat Ending,"I don't want to spoil the ending, but after a good build-up, the ultimate goal of Burton et al is just sort of sprung on the reader. All is right again on the Riverworld."
2,Skip this book and stop at number 4,"""Gods of Riverworld"" reminds me of one of those books that get written after an author dies - by another author in a vain effort to carry on the story line. Like these types of books, this book seems contrived and something Farmer put together out of notes -- like filler material. If you are just starting the Riverworld series, by all means read the first 4, but you can safely skip this one unless you absolutely must have your Riverworld Farmer fix."
2,I shouldn't have gone back,"Having reached the tower of the Ethicals in the previous volume, Burton and his comrades must solve the mysterious death of the last Ethical and come to terms with their own godlike powers of resurrection now that they are in control of the tower's machinery.I was disappointed by the four novels of the original series but, unfortunately, I am OCD when it comes to series, so I felt compelled to read this book anyway. (I have ""Quest to Riverworld"" sitting on my bookshelf as well.) The narrative often gets lost in the backstories and side stories of the numerous characters, so author Philip Jose Farmer doesn't manage to build up much narrative drive."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Ethical kill mystery.X, or whoever you want to call him/her/it/whatever, is dead. Having made it to the tower, and having the resurrection power now available to it, what would a bunch of sneaky dodgy human types do with it?Not always good things, and resurrecting people galore takes up a lot of space.Whether this is a necessary book or not, not completely sure, but no worse than book 3, certainly.3 out of 5"
4,Good combination of Life & Health (Accident & Disability),"Combines the Dearborne Pastrack Health Insurance & Life Insurance License Exam Manuals.Overall it is a good study guide (I passed using this book with 2 weeks of leisurely at home study), but the test section could be revamped - it did not include enough questions that were like the ones on the actual exam (I took an Experior Online state exam)."
2,Not bad but nothing spectacular!,"If you like the commercial pop metal that was going on like warrant, Firehouse, & Mr Big during the 80's and early 90's it's not bad. By the time this band's 2 albums came along, the last good days of arena rock & hair bands was about over. Grunge and alternative pretty much elbowed their way in. I still enjoyed giving them a listen because I'm still a shameless metalhead, but it's no wonder they couldn't outlast the era. My hobby is collecting Christian rock & metal so I'm glad it's in my archives when I want to hear some good hair bands."
4,here comes jackson,"a guilty pleasure. A misunderstood man (jackson)with an insatiable urge to kill tries to go straight and bury his impulses. Its all for ""the girl"" he tells his drunk father who tells him you are what you are. This is like a poor mans good vs evil. The story is pretty simple and at times humorous (as its meant to be). There is an unusual amount of carnage every time Jackson falls off the wagon and kills. The film tries to portray jackson as a tortured soul grappling for some sense of purpose but it just can't pull it off. Its like pity me, i can't help but rip out this guys heart and tear his face to pieces. Oh well, the film is what it is and thats an entertaining way to waste an hour and a half when theres nothing else to do."
4,Walt Disney's Daniel Boone - V. 4 The Promised Land,"Long before the West was won, Daniel Boone (Dewey Martin), the most famous frontiersman of them all, had a powerful itch to see Kentucky, the unexplored wilderness on the other side of the Cumberland Mountains. You won't want to miss a single episode of his action packed, suspense-filled journeys into uncartered territory.VOLUME FOUR: THE PROMISED LANDThe road to The Promised Land is paved with mud, as Crowfeather, his band of renegade Indians, a double-crossing partner and Chief Blackfish's Shawnee tribe try to force Daniel to turn back. But Boone still belives that Kentucky is big enough for everyone.Stars Dewey Martin and introduced by Walt Disney."
4,Does The Job,"As others have said it does move a bit if you don't rest the bottom on the dash but that is not hard to organise. It sticks very well and has managed to remain on for about 5 days, without me having even cleaned the windscreen first.One comment I have noticed that is wrong is that you cannot angle it sideways. This is actually quite easy to do simply by adjusting the angle at which you attach the suction cup to the windscreen. If you angle the suction cup section so that it is not straight up and down the windscreen then you can get the units face to point off to the side and the rotating head (directly under the GPS mounting bracket) allows you vertically allign the GPS itself.Would be 5 stars but for the movement and the difficulty of putting GPS in/out with power cable in.Steve"
3,Amazon has the wrong part number,This had to be returned because the part number Amazon had is incorrect. Had to to Garmin for the correct number.
5,Hands Free at Last,"I was looking for a product that would do what this mounting bracket does. In the past I used to hold my GPSr in hand till I reach a location, but now I just slide it in and I am free to use both hands to drive.What I like the most is that you can use it on any car, even if you want to use it on a friend's or a rental, you can travel with it since it is very light and small to pack."
4,Works great!,"For the price, this product is almost perfect. I found that it can be reconfigured (which they don't tell you) in a number of orientations so the adjustment axes and knobs suite your requirements. The only drawback is no yaw adjust, in other words, you can't point the screen in the direction (side-to-side) that you want it to point. Seems like this would have been easy enough to do with a simple ball-joint, but hey... Most times it's not a problem since the mounting surface (windshield) is perpendicular to the viewer, anyway. As far as adhesion, I've used it in some pretty gnarly off-road situations and it hasn't come loose yet. If you use a DC power supply, the mount is designed to allow the DC plug to clear the mount, but it's sort of a pain to get the plug in after it's mounted - or to get it mounted once plugged in for that matter. Easiest if you can just leave it mounted in place."
4,Good utility accessory,"While a nicely compacted mount, I would have liked a bit more flexibility in the distance the GPS can be adjusted away from the windshield. Also, the ability to pivot left and right when the GPS is vertical would be a huge improvement. But, all that said, the bracket is a big improvement over driving with one hand while holding the GPS in the other."
3,Ok,"Like the other stand I purchased for my Garmin, the construction of these feels a tad cheap - but it does the trick."
3,"Great Price, But Fragile","I used this mount for my Garmin 60CSx for about six months before the mount broke. What happened was the plastic grip over the screws the mount uses to lock the hinges into place broke when I over-tightened one. The plastic split down the middle and there went my ability to tighten the hinge. That was my fault, likely, and I don't fault the product for it given the price. It's worth buying for its simple purpose, but if you do pick one up, don't torque the screws down like a lug nut, :DI'll be buying another when spring rolls around!"
5,Garmin Strret Pilot GPS,I am totally amazed as to how great this system works.I would not travel again without one of these devices on board.
2,"Fragile, latch breaks easily","I have had this item for about a year. It is made mostly of plastic. The plastic latch used to apply suction broke after about 8 months. I glued it, but the effort required of the plastic latch is simply too great and glue will not easily hold.Additionally, there are no replacement parts available, so the unit itself must be replaced.I cannot recommend this unit .I have ordered a metal unit from RAM to replace it."
1,It doesn't stick to my window,"I haven't been able to get this bracket to stick to the window of my Jeep no matter what I try, and that's just in the driveway, without the GPS in it. I can't imagine it would hold on the road, especially on rough terrain. The suction cup is flat and wimpy. I'd skip it and try the one that has the lock down mechanisim for your dashboard. If I only had a dashboard, I would have picked that one myself. I may try putting my own suction cup on it."
3,Garmin GPS windshield mount,Garmin is a good product; this mount is a little tough to get the GPS in and out of the mount
3,"Nice Bracket, poor suction",Like the Bracket concept but the suction cup never seem to work right holding the heavey GPS unit.
4,Garmin GPS 60Csx Auto Mounting Bracket / Suction Cup,"works fine, but for my ""mature vision"" it ends up being too far away when mounted on the windhield. I'm trying it on my side window."
1,Cheap product !,"This item is a waste of money! It falls all the time. The suction cup is cheap, mediocre and very flimsy. Most of the time, I will find the bracket in the floor after returning to my car. It simply will not hold to the windshield for long period.Do not recommend!!!!!"
5,race car ( go books),"very cute book , my 1 1/2 year old grandson loved it just big enough for his little hands,"
3,England's all time best Preacher,Good movie about the life of London's most famous Preacher during the Victorian age. The bonus feature gives some good background about his theology.
2,Struggling to finish...,"I haven't finished this book yet.. I'm not sure if I'll be able to. It really does drone on and on. I'm about 3/4 of the way through, and I find my attention drifting as I listen, then I have to rewind and listen again. I think the narrator is a little more to blame than the author, but the story isn't exactly fast-paced either. The best part so far is a detailed account of an SS officer's cowardly escape during the Russian invasion of Dresdin. Sadly, the tempo of that sub-storyline just isn't in the rest of the book."
2,Overkill,"The first seventy pages of, Overkill, obey the title doling out gritty details of the increasing microbial reistance to antibiotics: what we are doing to to make things worse, how microbes form resistances, and so on, all set against a background of historic trends in infectious disease. The rest of the book focuses on the last six words of the subtitle, ""what we can do about it."" If you are interested in herbal remedies, the importance of hydration, strategic uses of vitamins, child care tips, potential pathogen perils in the home, and recipes for natural cleansers and sprays, you could find this interesting. I didn't. The epilogue sums up with well-worn advice, ""The future brings uncetainty, but with it, tremendous hope."" If your prinicpal interest is the microbes and their resistances, this is not the book for you. Try, Beasts of the Earth, The Antibiotic Paradox, The Coming Plague, The Killers Within, and/or Microcosmos."
3,Fun record but I recommend it for fans only.,"If you are a big Phil Lewis fan, a glam rock devotee, or a relative of one of the band members, buy this record. If not, listen to it first. It's a fun disc with Phil's songs as the high points and the other guy's songs as the low ones. If you like your rock n roll simple and pretty, you will probably enjoy this record. If you are looking for depth and complexity, check out Phil's ""More Purple Than Black"". If you are looking for record to kick you right in the trousers that is also in this genre, then check out LA Guns' early 90's stuff."
3,an o.k recording,"bought this disc thinking phil lewis provided the vocals on all tracks, to my disappointment he does not. phil lewis sings about half of the songs on the disc sharing the vocals with steve dior. the disc is an alright listen but for those LAG fans hoping to hear phil lewis on all the songs, beware. as for the music, ladbroke groove, which closes out the disc, has a LAG sound to it and is a definite highlight but also worth noting are: outta control, black cadillac and baby i want. steve dior does an ok job on his portion of the music but he's no phil lewis. if you looking for something different from phil lewis check out his solo album titled 'more purple than black'."
3,Phil Lewis post LA Guns 1998!!,Really not a bad album.........not the LA Guns stuff u would normally expect nonetheless its Phil Lewis..........not many highlite and pretty blah at best.......
5,"The best ""hands on"" asp.net book","This is the best ""hands on"" book on ASP.Net I've read. It walks you thru a complete ecommerce site, complete with n-tier business objects, stored procedures, etc. The code is very easy reading, with explanations for everything, and the code works, unlike a lot of examples I've seen.The ecommerce app is written with vb code-behind and slq server.Buy this book and get started on your ecommerce site."
4,Well Done and easy to follow,"This is a good book for beginner in E-commerce. Don't think it will explain principles like Interfaces or Inheritance in this book. You must have a relatively good level of understanding VB.NEt and the OOP approach before jump in it. The chapters on the Order Pipeline, (11 and 12) and credit card transaction are very well explain. You will have to complete the application before use it. ( The suppliers project is not in and some others but...) Good book and easy to read"
4,Excellent and informative book,"I've used this book to construct my first e-commerce website, and I don't think I could have managed without it. The 3 tier design of the sample site is very well organised and easy to adapt to your own requirements. It also makes it simpler for a novice like me to understand how everything works. I found the second part of the book (dealing with the order pipeline and credit card transactions) harder to follow. However, when I contacted the authors about a problem I was having, I received a prompt and friendly reply that soon got me back on track. Thanks, Cristian and Karli!"
4,inspiring book,"Here is another great book from Roberta Horton. This is not a book of patterns for you to copy, but rather ideas and concepts to use when creating your original work of art. Her ""gallery"" of quilts is exciting and motivating to look at."
5,Opening new Vistas,"This book has opened my world to new and unbounded possibilities. There is hope for the dawning of a new and wonderfull age on Earth and this author explains how it can happen. If you fancy yourself as one of the 144,000 then I advise you to read it."
4,A great addition to the series,"Thieves World was one of the most popular fantasy series in the 80's. I remember going to Boscone and Worldcon and seeing many of the characters, er, attendies, roll playing parts from the books. I also remember a couple of the girls getting arrested for indecent exposure for following the dress (un dress?) styles mentioned in the books a little too closely. Ah memories.If you can find the series, you'll enjoy it. From the immortal who winds up as a live disection subject (hey, he keeps healing...) to the gods playing dice with the lives of the characters. Many of the best SF and fantasy authors bent their pens on this series. As for me, I'm going to find the photos from those con's...."
4,still good 53 years later,"Some things stick in your mind for a long time and this book did that for me. I was curious to re-read a book I remember from my childhood and as a middle agedadult the book still holds the message because it makes you long for the simple way of life. I believe any child reading this book can relate to the sadness and intrigue the book holds as this story is more than 50 years old, but some things never change."
3,ST: Strange New Worlds IV,"This is the fourth installment of the Strange New Worlds series highlighting new talent writing the the genre of TREK. Talented fans submit short stories written for a contest for publication.In the past, we saw some exceptional talent and originality, storylines that took you to areas of TREK that only short stories could. This anthology was engaging but fell a tad short of the prevoius three. I'm sure the fans have not lost interest, but I'm wondering if the editor has or maybe his direction and view of the TREK universe has been skewed.There are 22 short stories contained in the anthology that continue in the different genre of the TREK series. I found that these stories to be good and thoughtfully written. Entertaining to a degree but a spark missing.I wouldn't pass this volume up though as it will show the maturing process of some very promissing writers... future of TREK is in these pages a little recondite, but emerging nonetheless."
2,More Burned Out!,"I read this book, hoping it would be written on an adult level. It is not. It is patronizing and condescending toward those diabetics like myself who have lived with the disease for many years. I was diagnosed 61 years ago and still need help with the stress and anger associated with a difficult life. Yes, I know how to manage my disease. I would not have survived this long had I not had good self-management skills. Yes, I have had both counseling and been put on antidepressants. In spite of what is going well in my life with diabetes, I still scored poorly on every test! Unbelievable, so now I am feeling worse than when I started the book. I think the book is geared for those who need lots of help within a few years of diagnosis. It is of no use for those of us in this for the long haul who need more than the same old solutions and are apparently worse off than we had ever dreamed!"
3,Good,"This book has a lot of information about homosexuality, I don't necessarily agree with all of it but, it's interesting to see how others feel about this issue. If you or someone you know is having difficulty in being a good catholic and also have problems with same-sex attraction, I think this book might offer you some help, but you need to read it cautiously as some of the interpretations of the Bible passages as well as other opinions are not in accordance with the teachings of the Catholic Church. It gives you some light and tools to understand homosexuality better."
2,Lacking Synthesis or Analysis,"I was a faithful Kozmo.com customer - even as my friends and I were placing orders for goods (with an ""on time or free"" policy), we never could figure out how they were making any money. The documentary is just ""ok"" but not really revealing of the whole internet bubble as a force to propel something without a clear revenue model like Kozmo to the top of the heap. Now - who needs Kozmo with N'flix ""instant play"" and CSAs that deliver to your door."
4,Good documentary on the dot-com bubble,"The Bottom Line:Though E-dreams suffers from the fact that it's less compelling and well-made than its contemporary ""[...],"" it's an interesting enough documentary for people intrigued by that particular economic bubble.3/4"
4,Gone with the wine,"A lovely read, I can't get enough of these stories writer about people from English speaking countries moving to France."
5,Great Frisbee Product,"I think these are my dogs favorite toys. You can throw them, roll them on the ground, and play tug with them. They are pretty durable as they are made of rubber. They claim to clean your dogs teeth, Im not sure how well, but my dog also loves to chew it... Only problem is once she starts chewing it, it starts to break apart. I usually buy a few and save one to play outside with and keep it where she wont chew it, that one lasts a long time... 6+ months, the others may only last acouple months depending on how much she chews it."
3,Dirty DVDs,"I bought this product from Amazon.com new, not used and the DVDs are covered in some kind of sticky substance and is scratched. We were able to get it to play in a DVD player, but we had to competely skip an epsiode because of a scratch. It's too late to return this item, but I advise anyone who buys online, to open the product when they get it because it could be scratched and messed up. Regardless if it's new or not."
2,House MD (5),"Okay with this item I downloaded the seasson but it is kept in the amazon library, when I purchase this item I wanted to burn it and and not keep it in the laptop, I bought it I should be able to do with it what I wanted, or maybe I did it wrong."
2,House MD: Season Five,"I ordered House Season Five on Sept 24 from Michael Corset. I was informed that the order was shipped Sept 28 and should be delivered by Oct 19. It was Oct 22 and I still did not receive my order. Why it would take a month to deliver was more than I had anticipated, but not receiving it at all was very disappointing. Amazon replied they would credit my credit card, which has not shown up yet - hopefully my next statement."
5,"It's ""House"" what else is there to say?",Seriously lol.. I'm not sure what all is on this particular one but I think I've got the whole set now. LOVE House :)
5,Awesome Show!!!,This is a great show! I love it! Once you see one episode you will be hooked! Dr. House Rocks!
5,"House Episode 24, season 5",What looked like positive solutions for House's current problems turn tables. House's mental instability causes major misdiagnoses of his patients. Chase and Cameron previously caught cold-feet on an impending marriage in the last episode; thus the conclusion of their relationship is exemplified in this episode.In recent episodes House's medical career appears to be at stake due to his diminishing mental faculties. One has to wonder if House will continue or not.
4,Like it,"I never bought into the criticism that the new characters were the problem with the drifting of Season 4. The new characters really do show promise as evidenced in this 1st episode of 5. My contention all along is that there was some sloppy writing in some of the episodes of 4 and that the characters are really what the writer makes of them, and good acting.This 1st episode is more reminiscent of the classic House. I would have liked to have seen House more involved with the medical decisions here, but it's understandable that time needed to be devoted to build the personal story involving Wilson.It really leaves one wondering how House can hold his life together. He is the extreme case of a person, or people, each of us have known, or know. This is what partly drives the popularity of this show.I look forward to seeing how his character unfolds, or unravels, throughout this season and hopefully many more to come."
3,The show needs a new direction and writing needs to improve,"I used to love this show when it first premiered and have been a faithful follower throughout all its many seasons. Having said that I feel that the antics of Dr. House are getting a bit tiresome and I am waiting for either Dr. Wilson or someone else to punch him in the face. The storyline remains the same, a medical mystery is presented at the beginning of the show and the rest of the show is devoted to the eventual solution. I will watch it to the end but the writing has to improve."
2,Disappointing,Love the TV show. Game is boring. For each level you are constantly doing the same thing. Gets old fast. Never finished it.
2,DVDs Skip,"I bought House Season 5 as a Christmas gift for a family member. The package came in undamaged and unopened, but the 3rd and 4th disks skip repeatedly. We have tried playing the disks in different DVD and Blu-ray players without success. The disks look like they have heat damage or something else wrong with them. We love the show, but the quality of the disks we received were horrible."
2,Same story over and over again,"Weird medical conditions with a twist and House saves the day. Watch any episode, they are all fundamentally the same.Great for medically inclined people that have a fascination with weird prognosis and symptoms.This is no slam at the actor who should get out of his contract and do some real acting. He would be good and believable in other films or series. He is wasting his talent here."
5,I love it!,"House, MD is an amazing show. I have the other 4 seasons and needed 5 to complete the collection. Season 5 was a great one and worth what I spent for it!"
5,LOVE HOUSE,"This DVD set was so worth the money and more, and I love the addictiveness of the show and the awesome chemistry of the characters."
1,TRASH,"this product had scratches on it and the case was broken with the wrong sleeve on it and it was sup[posed to be ""like new"" and the DVD's were very used and at points the disks do not work at ALL!!!"
2,"Weak, weak weak","What a shame. ""House"" was my obsession, but with the disappearance of clinic patients, the stupid PI plot, the sparse appearances of Cameron and Chase, and sub par writing this season, I would never purchase this season.There are just no episodes from this year that I would like to see again. I was hoping with the recent departure of ""Kutner"" they were shaking things up and finding a way to bring Cameron and Chase back into the foreground, but it was only due to the actor himself pursuing another career.""House"" is broken.I sincerely hope they fix it.One revision-I wrote this prior to the last two episodes of this season.They, if nothing else, are worth watching this season."
1,Change...not for the better.,"To each his own. I can't imagine anyone thinking this season was anything but a disaster. For me, it isn't about old team vs new team. It's about the writing, the scripts, all just circling the drain. House now tries to get by with shock value, rather than good plot. So bad. I guess it went on one season too long."
1,House season 5,"I love the TV show House. That being said, however, I have also been sold the ""upgrade to Bluray"" pitch. While I know that regular DVDs will play just fine on my machine, I simply refuse to shell out money for anything but Bluray discs now that I have the machine. I'd rather wait for the occasional rerun than buy a substitute for what I expect. If they won't make it available on Bluray, they won't get my money!!!"
5,House-Season 5,"I've watched ""House"" since Season 1 and have purchased all previous seasons on DVD. I love House (probably because he's not MY doctor!) Season 5 is as great of quality as the others. It contains bonus material, including interviews with cast and crew about the 100th episode, which is always considered a big milestone when any show reaches this point. As any big ""House"" fan knows, Hugh Laurie is British. So it's always fun to be reminded of this fact when he is interviewed and of course uses his British accent. Sound and video quality are great. The packaging could use improvement, as the DVDs are stacked on top of each other, which makes it a bit achward in getting them out. However, this is being done more and more so as to make for a more compact package. As always, Amazon.com does a great job with shipping! I look forward to buying Season 6 when it becomes available next year."
4,Great cast,"I love this show. It has moments where it is very suttle, yet it also has moments that leave your on the edge of your seat."
5,"Best season of any show EVER. ""Pencil cup.""","I didn't get into House until around Season 3... but thanks to USA network, I've been able to catch about every episode since. Season 5 is the best season of any show I've ever seen, especially the season finale. It was even better than some of the Smallville finales (which I didn't think would ever be possible!) :)There have been a lot of reviews already on this season, so I'll keep it short. Bringing back _____ after _______'s suicide (censored on purpose) was the most brilliant piece of writing I've ever had the privilege of experiencing. And the season ending?! The best ever. I've turned on some people to the House series just by showing them the last 5 minutes of the season ending.Thank you to the actors, the amazing writers, and everyone else involved in the series for bringing me such TV viewing pleasure! I cannot recommend House enough, especially this season, to all newcomers!"
5,Excellent!!!,"The package came earlier then posted, and it was in excellent condition. My fiancé loves House!!!! I don't know what else to say about this product. I think twenty word min is a bit much"
4,"House, M.D. - Season Five","The things I have enjoyed about House are still present in the fifth season of the show. The character drama is handled extremely well, the acting is top notch, and all around this season has some incredibly solid episode. While not every episode is a hit and some of the storylines don't feel quite right, this is a very stable season that is easily 4 stars. This is by far one of the most unique medical dramas ever and it's a testament to the show's quality that it can stay interesting even after 100 episodes."
5,When first we practice to deceive...,"""Oh what a tangled web we weave...when first we practice to deceive.""""Concept of Justice"" is an outstanding novel about deception and the ""tangled web"" philosophy. Custer has crafted a brilliant novel of suspense, that takes the reader through the criminal mind and how a person who practices deception justifies him or herself along the way while spinning a bigger and more fantastic web. The descriptions, details, and settings are written flawlessly. The characters are believeable and well developed.To give any plot away would only ruin the read. Get all sticky in this smartly spun tale. Make sure you don't have anything to do when you open the book up...you'll want to read it straight through. Outstanding."
1,Please...,"This book isn't worth it. The reviews speak of the book as though it is great, must be friends of the author. I personally don't see it."
3,aight,"movie is split in 5 sections/cab rides... one in la, one in ny, one in france, etc.L.A. with Winona was really sleepy and was kinda lame, the NY was over acted and super stereotypical... france was cool kinda real, rome was insane (roberto benigni was funny, a little annoying, and rather unbeliveable), and hellsinki was pretty real. really could have used a narative or something to tie it together. it's worth a watch mainly for the 2nd half of the movie."
4,No more Winona,"If it wasn't for her dreadful performance (as usual), Jarmush would have had another masterpiece on his hands."
3,Three out of five of the stories in this are funny,"It's five stories about five cab drivers and their passengers (one fare) in five different cities (two in America & three in Europe). It all happens in one night. I liked three of them. I didn't like the one in Los Angeles or Helsinki much. The funnest one was Rome. The cabbie picks up a priest and tells him a perverted confession. The Paris and New York is good too. In New York, a Black man gets picked up by an Eastern European cabbie who shouldn't be behind the wheel and the Paris one is a cabbie who picks up a cantankerous blind young woman. Those stories are amusing too. The three stories will make 90 minutes. The cabbie in Rome is worth the rental price and the three stories is about 90 minutes. So you have a short movie if you just watch the three I liked. You might want to give it a viewing."
3,Only partially worth it,"Winona Ryder's acting in the first (L.A.) segment is forced and unnatural, and the story is too cliche and predictable. The New York portion was a little better, but not by much. Paris and Rome, I think were definitely the most watchable, particularly thanks to the acting--Roberto Benigni is to be noted here.However, my heart belongs to the Helsinki segment which gave exposure to this otherwise forgotten corner of the earth. I felt at home while watching it, and this was largely achieved by the use of the Finnish language. This is rare in a mainstream film. Naturally, the cliches of Finland as a land of permanent frost and drunkards had to sneak in, but that didn't really mess with the overall experience."
5,One of Jarmusch's Funniest and Most Touching Films,"Rarely does a film make me laugh out loud -- this one did. The film is also at times very touching, which is really an accomplishment to do inside the same film. The funniest of the five segments was the one set in Paris. This is because unlike the New York and particularly the Rome segments, it was not obviously played for laughs. Isaach De Bankolé, who plays the Parisian taxi driver is right on the money. His interplay with Béatrice Dalle is perfect. I was even more impressed with his work in this film after seeing him again in Jarmusch's GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI playing a very different character. The closing segment, which was set in Helinski, I found the most moving. Jarmusch, who is a true maverick filmmaker, is his most accessible here. If you've never seen his work before, this is a great place to start."
3,"Some high points, but average overall","The second vignette, based in New York, was quite funny and touching, but the rest of the film was not at this level. Roberto Begnini was funny but I felt like I was watched a stand-up comic's rountine that had merely been moved from the stage to the inside of a cab. Still, the cast is quite good."
4,Travel the world with Tom and Jim,The camera is the Jarmusch 'eye' and you travel with him and his musician buddy Tom Waits across the world as the unseen occupants in taxi cabs. This voyeuristic trip mixes comedy with some serious ideas and even tragedy. A beautiful film that gives you some things to think about as it bridges the often huge divide that can arise between America and Europe.
4,"Slightly flawed collage, but extremely entertaining!","This is one of the first films I ever saw on the Independent film channel, and it made me a fan of idependent films right away. Extremely funny, absorbing, and often touching, this film captures a bit of human nature in globetrotting episodes that encapsulate absurdity in everday natural settings. Acting is more than competent. Some scense are better than others, but well, well, well worth owning."
5,"Fablous, but not just funny","I agree the movie is fabulous, but I definitely object against regurding it just as a funny one... Anyway - WERE IS THE DVD?..."
4,Great indy film...,"This movie is a great film from Jim Jarmusch. It really involves multiple-story lines all interwoven. In that respect, it reminds me much of ""Mystery Train.""Features brief glimpses into the lives of multiple taxi cab drivers, each in various parts of the world. It is all pretty funny. But also reminiscent of ""taxi cab confessions."" Literally, in the case of the Italy scene(s)/story.What's the best part about this movie? I'd venture to say it would have to be the soundtrack. Good ol' Tom Waits. Fits perfectly.You'll enjoy it."
4,It IS a very good movie,"but it helps if you speak more than one language. The episode in Rome is hilariously funny - of course - but the others are all pretty good too. I am really disappointed not to find this movie in DVD, but I hope that will be corrected soon."
4,Enjoyable!,"MIDNIGHT MAGIC by Shari AntonNovember 26, 2005Amazon rating 4/5""In 1145, Alberic, bastard son of the Earl of Chester, has just slain William de Leon in the name of King Stephen, and been granted the estate of Camelen. Knighted by Stephen, Alberic is offered his choice of wife amongst the three half English, half Welsh de Leon daughters. The two not chosen are to be sent to a nunnery and to the King's Court. Alberic decides to marry the middle daughter, Gwendolyn. The strongest of the three sisters, Gwen is also the inheritor of her mother's legacy, which involves Merlin, magic, and the love between the woman who owns the Pendant and the man who wears the ring of Pendragon."" - Complete review at BookLoons - M. LoftonI get caught up with these medieval romances. The historical facts seem to be accurate, and the characters are a lot of fun. Recommended."
1,Bad decision,I discovered it was a bad decision to order sunglasses online. The glasses I ordered were different from the ones I saw in the picture. The ones I received were a dark blue and looked little like the picture. They were also very small (like kids' sunglasses). I have a small head and they were very tight on me.
1,Return of The Scarlet Pimpernel,"I thought the same cast from the first one would be in this movie too. Boy, was I wrong!!! I loved both Leslie Howard and his leading lady in The Scarlet Pimpernel! In the sequel, these are people I never heard of or seen before. What a huge let down! I already own the original, but thought I'd go ahead and buy this one for the sequel. I sent it back! Wasn't going to pay a dime for the sequel! I tried to watch it all the way through and may have, but everything about this movie was inferior to the first one. Don't buy it!!!"
5,Excellent antidote to legalism,"One of the dangers of the church's response to laxity in morals is the tendency to drift (or run) into legalism. This can be directed both at the members of a church and at those outside the church. However, with any focus on morality comes the danger of undermining God's free salvation through faith in Christ. Allison chronicles the changes in preaching from that of a gospel of faith alone to one of a mixture of faith and works. Don't let the history aspect put you off - this is a book for any believer who struggles with sin and the basis of God's acceptance."
2,Nice design but too small,"I was looking for a smaller and more compact container for my daily meds. These are nice, but much too small for my needs. I also think this vendor charges too much for delivery."
4,A middle class set with high price,"The product is very nice, however they send you different product and not as advertized, probably money saving. the file is cheap glass file and not as advertized. The tweezer is also different. They also do not have a phone number listed and you have to look for these people. I was able to get in touch with chi chi and she sent the swiss tweeze as advertized but the file is cheap glass file."
5,ONE OF THE BEST RIGHT ANGLE SCREWDRIVERS,"I GOT THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT MANY YEARS AGO..THIS SET HAS SAVED ME COUNTLESS TIMES!!!YOU CAN ALSO USE THE RIGHT ANGLE HEAD IN YOUR POWER SCREW DRIVER !!!!!THE BITS & THE REST OF THE TOOL SET IS GREAT QUALITY!!!I USE IT ALL THE TIME & IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME......IT COMES WITH TWO DIFFERENT LENTH EXTENSIONS,THAT ALSO FORM A STRAIGHT DRIVER IN THREE DIFFERENT LENTHS,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RIGHT ANGLE SCREW DRIVER SET , THIS ONE IS TOPS!!!!!THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!!!!!"
4,good sampling,"I probably would have given this five stars if it was more than 90mins. There was also something weird with the audio on ""Shipbuilding"". I don't know if that's only with my copy though. Otherwise a good sampling of EC's varied styles. I prefer the version of ""Veronica"" from this show the best."
4,Dark Room,"I was so overcome by this book. This is the first works I have read by Narayan and I was thoroughly pleased. What makes it so well written is the reality with which Narayan captures the culture of India and defines the roles that governed marriages in the 1930's. I must admit he is not too far off base in depicting marriage arrangements and the struggles of women in the 21st century. At times I was disappointed with its realism, the speech, the actions of the characters. It was all too familiar. A powerful and honest portrayal of how husbands and wives act in marriage."
5,patti labelle steals the show once again,i think it was off the hook if your a patti fan or even a aretha fan this is somthing you must have to add to your collection
1,Extremely disappointed,"Sometimes it would pay to read reviews more closely. Had I read that these songs were medleys and were of poor quality, I would not have wasted my money. Unless you are a die hard Dean fan and want anything by this crooner, avoid this package. The sound quality is horrendous and the song titles are misleading as you find out when the song becomes a medley. All these complaints were listed in other reviews. So buyer beware ! Pass on this one."
1,Poor C/D sound quality.,"Poor C/D sound quality. It is, as if, you are listening to Dean on AM radio. If you are looking for a swinging C/D to play @ Martini-time, this is NOT the C/D, for you. I almost tossed it, after listening to Shirley Mac's version of Innamorata...PLEASE BE AWARE."
1,very disappointing,The sound quality is poor. These sound like old tapes of TV shows recorded with a faulty patch cord. Don't waste your time or your money.
3,Interesting read but ...,"The book is interesting and reads well. But it doesn't deliver up to the expectations for the following:- It is too basic. Most of the readers won't be able to use real options at all after reading- It is not so practical. Lacks the tools that the other book by Boer includedOverall, is an interesting read to get familiar with the kind of situation where real options are of use and increase your culture on the matter, but it is not a practical ""solution"""
4,Explicit Treatment of a New Analytical Framework,This book attempts to expose the reader in a nontechnical manner to the new technique of evaluating investments in the New Economy characterised by volatility and uncertainty.The author does so without resorting to mathematical methods.The book is basically expository and attempts to build upon the readers'familiarity with financial options.It concentrates in describing the real options which each business decision is confronted with and demonstrates the flexibility which managers face. He views these opportunities as options even the decision not to implement the plan. This is a creative approach to understanding what real options is all about.
4,Insights on Risk Management,"A comprehensive analysis of managing risk, with facinating lessons from the actions of nations, business, and individuals combined with interesting insights on how science, technology, creativity, and innovation help create value. Particularly appropriate to our current business crisis is the brief discussion of darkness and fog. Bottom line--planning and analysis should be a high-priority and ongoing process in management."
1,Complete rubbish,Before reading the book I had spent only 15 minutes reading an article in a business magazine about real options. In those 15 minutes I learnt more about real options than after reading 280 pages in Dr. Boer's book.I am just amazed about the other ratings below - these people must just be from another planet?!!Do yourself a favour and do not buy this book (if your intent is to learn anything useful about real options). This is actually the first book I have ever thrown into the garbage bin (honestly).
5,deathklok,"Washes well, though I do not put it in the dryer. It is a sm/med for the med I ordered. All in all I am very pleased with it."
1,Review??,"I would like to review the T-Shirt that I ordered, but I have not received it yet. Iwas shipped an entirely different shirt from what I ordered and that shirt sucks."
4,Liked it!,"Agreed this book is written in a somewhat bizarre way, but have to say, really liked the little boy and his sister. Brave fellow, who, in hs own way, was looking for his own redemption.Set in a time period that I did not know much about; this book, despite using a tragic background,has its moments of such humor and innocence.Strongly recommend!"
4,Great Read for Clevelanders of a Certain Era,"Having lived through the great gas explosion in Cleveland during my childhood, it was fascinating to relive it through the eyes of Robertson's character in the book. I bought a copy for a friend as well. If you enjoy recent history and especially if you are from Cleveland, you'll enjoy reading about the people and places he recounts in his book."
3,The Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread,"A good book, but would be so much more readable without having the main character being referred to by his full name in every other sentence. It gets really annoying, and definitely interrupts the flow of reading."
2,Books for smart people,"I feel as though I must not be intellectual enough to appreciate this one. I got stuck around page 40 in the midst of some train of thought paragraph when I realized that this same paragraph had started several pages back and would continue on for 11 pages. The book rambles, and goes no where. I thought I might find this midly intriguing since I grew up near Cleveland and at least know the areas the novel is refering to, but that is not the case either. I guess I just can't appreciate the author's genius. I'm not losing sleep over it."
2,bored to tears,"I'm on page 60 and nothing of any merit has occurred. Affected writing, an infinitely boring prelude to (please!) something interesting, abysmal pacing, and a weak sense of Americana (this isn't Saroyan's The Human Comedy, people) are efficiently suffocating me. However, I always finish what I begin, and so despite this plodding trek through nowhere, I will continue. Stephen King likes it. What does that tell you? I took a shot, and that's exactly what it feels like."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"This book is horrible. It is boring, confusing, and dule. The ""adventure"" doesn't start until the end really which makes for apretty bad book. If you want my opinion this book is only about a strange kid, his braty sister, and a wagon!"
5,A Must Have for Serious Collectors,"I sell vintage costume jewelry for a living so, as you can probably imagine, I have a lot of books on the subject. This is definitely one of the best. It's filled with fantastic background information on the making of costume jewelry, the top name designers and popular styles. The photos (b&w and color) provide good illustrations and are often of rarer, less-frequently-seen styles. I also like the fact that it's a smaller paperback book (as opposed to a large format hardcover). It's easier to take to antique/jewelry shows and thumb through when necesary."
1,Cc Costume Jewelry 2edby Harrice S. Miller (Author),This book was perhaps a little more helpful than another by this author pertaining to costume jewelry but it still leaves much to be desired for the beginner trying to learn about prices and pieces of costume jewelry. I do not recommend.
3,when purchased I didn't realize the age of the book,I didn't realize this book was from the 90's or I wouldn't have purchased it. So I haven't really looked at it much
3,ok for fashion buffs,again i needed help pricing costume jewelery this has a lot of high end pieces. not helpful for my needs
1,Don't waste your money/No pierda su dinero..,"It is not what I have expected. You can take it as a guide for the 19th century, but not for our days, when man used their woman as animals, instead of having fun together.No es lo que me expectaba. Puede ser una buena guia para hombres que tratan a sus mujeres como animales y no una forma de convicencia y aprendizaje."
3,Acceptable,"It's not bad for a cheap charger. But I do have to wonder what color ""nacarat"" is, because apparently when the indicator light is that color, the charge is almost complete. Obviously imported from the far east somewhere. But it's nice to have a charger that I can plug straight into the wall (with the fold out plug) AND use in the car! Not bad for the money. I just hope it doesn't cook any of my batteries. Long term will tell.EDIT: I've been using this charger for almost three years now, and It's held up substantially better than the Canon chargers. I've had three Canon chargers in the same time period, and they've become inconsistent."
4,Solidly constructed system phone,I think this is probably one of the sturdiest system phones you can buy. I've been using them for years at home (you need a compatible PBX though) and they take quite a bashing with replacement needed only once they've been absolutely wrecked.
4,LR Baggs M1A,"I really like the pickup. It does sound ""electric"" in a way, but has so much more soul than my buddys Ovation. Very full and c risp. You can almost hear the body of the guitar. I say almost because the second coil isn't really picking up low frequencies. Maybe next time I'll try the M80, which I ""think"" picks up much lower freq from the second coil. A little bit plinky, but I'm covering a lot of ground musically. I'd say this pickup is perfect for fingerstylists."
3,Arrogant but good,"I DID like this romance, but there were many times I found it a bit high-handed and annoying. Dawn is a photojournalist hired by Byron to photograph his ancient Scottish castle for future use as a tourist spot, a fact he's none too pleased with but is being pressured into. They are attracted right off, but both are too strong-willed and independent to do anything about but snipe. I found Byron often too arrogant and chauvinistic and too unforgiving when Dawn made her point clear, which was usually with merit. He only wanted to see his own way though, and her feelings often didn't matter. However, the ending was satisfying, and I suppose was worth the tale beforehand. I medium recommendation.Cyndi"
1,buying shoes by mail,The merchandise arrived in a timely manner and as described. Returns option was clear and seems convienient although I did not use it.
2,Saucony Hurricane 8,"I just read the previous runner's reviews and have to agree that these 8s are not the same quality as the Saucony Hurricane 6s and 7s.I am 6'2"" and 180 lbs. I need a really good shoe to cushion the impact (shock absorption) of my daily 3 mile run. I don't seem to get the same ""feel"" from these that I did from the 6s and 7s.These 8s were a bit small (1/2 size smaller closeouts?) as I wear a 13 and, they wore out really fast. I'd buy some Hurricane 6s or 7s to replace them if I can locate a pair."
2,SIZE DISPARITY isnt advertised clearly,"the company was very kind in allowing me to return the shoes-- nonetheless, I wouldnt have had to return them if I had read ""all the fine print"" about the 'closeouts' running 1/2 size too small. I take responsibility for not reading the fine print, but I am ordering shoes, not closing on a house or something! It would be better for all parties, including seller, if the seller put the Size disparity in the headlines (or at least put an asterisk next to the price or size)."
3,Time Zones,"Garmin has several features that relate to the time of day. Some examples are sun & moon times, estimated time of arrival. If you have traveled into a different time zone out of your original setting, the GPS unit leaves it up to you to calculate the correct time based on your original setting. This is very inconvenient when you have traveled from the west coast to the east coast thru four time zones. It also provides a problem when your destination is right on a time zone border. A Cell Phones automatically changes for time zones, but NOT a GPS unit that can calculate exactly where you are in the world???? This is a Garmin overlook that I believe they should correct."
3,Garmin GPS60C car kit,Everything works but mounting the unit into the holder can be a bit of a pain and the power supply cord has to be connected AFTER the GPS is secured and removed BEFORE removing the GPS from the mount. The sandbag base does not slide on the dash because of the tacky bottom. Adjustments for viewing angle is good. It does need to have some kind of brace between the mounted GPS and the base or it shakes too much to be readable.
4,Good Intermediate DVD for fingerpicking,"I initially bought this DVD to see what type of ""strumming"" patterns Jim Croce used on his songs. I now realize that, for the most part, he didn't use any strumming patterns. This is a good DVD for those people who want to learn how to fingerpick Jim's songs. A lot of patterns are shown in step-by-step review. While this DVD contais a lot of information, it is not for a beginning guitarist. You should be comfortable with intermediate level playing. Overall I would give this DVD a 4 out of 5 rating."
5,A Fingerstyle Guitarists' Dream Come True,"I have been playing guitar for more years than most people have been alive but never was able to capture what recording artists were doing with their guitars until I purchased this dvd.Not only have I been able to learn the music of Jim Croce but thru Pete's lessons, the picking patterns I have learned are easily transferable to other songs from other artists I like.I now play this music on an acoustic steel string and a classical guitar with equal but different effect.I have just purchased another of Pete's dvds (Gordon Lightfood) and can't wait to master the Canadian's style."
4,Great book despite flaws,"I use Fritz 8 to study my books, so I can go through the variations and see the state of the game with ease. With that in mind, there are some flaws in this book, three most notable:1) Moves made by the amateur described as ""the decisive error"" are sometimes the ones that the million-move-monster recommends2) The master in question sometimes makes less than perfect moves, and a few crushing tactical opportunities were missed3) There are at least 3 errors in analysis per game. For example, in Game 19, 13. ...Re8 is billed as ""the only move,"" when it leads to forced mate in 5. 13. ...Nf6! 14. exf6 Bf5! holds the game for Black; White is still better but immediate mate is out of sight.However, these errors do not detract from the instructive quality of the book at all. It still does its job very well: Explaining why many common amateur moves are inferior (and showing how to exploit them), and teaching a great deal about strategy. I learned much from reading it. So will you."
5,The best chess book I have read so far,"A caveat is in order here: I have read only seven (for-beginners) books.However, I feel like my ""chess muscles"" have developed since I started reading this book.At first, I found it hard to read (at 300+ pages). Then I decided to take it slow, around five pages daily, to derive maximum value. On certain days, I got carried away and covered as many as 15 pages, which took me and my Pocketgrandmaster about two hours.Why is this the best chess book I have read so far? I found it filled with nuggets of chessic wisdom. Although I would expect that some of his analysis could now be questioned (given the evolution of chess theory since the publication date and the availability of powerful chess softwares), I think that there is still much to be learned from this book."
4,Great instruction for intermediate level players,"This book,along with its companion `The Road to Chess Mastery ',offers splendid instruction for middle level players.Euwe understands the thinking of both the master and the amateur,and explains them beautifully.The book also gives great insights into different opening strategies."
4,Instruction in middle game strategies by former world champ.,Euwe shoots for the amateur and is right on target. 'A' players and below find the weak spots in Master strategy and gain confidence in Euwe's text that illustrates that amateurs can defeat stronger opposition by excluding inferior moves from their middle game play. The first in a genre that has been duplicated for twenty years but not exceeded. A current pretender is Jeremy Silman's 'Improve Your Chess'.
2,Overpriced,"This book contained no more information than is already available on the web. Joel Fiulton's coments at times are very contrite. For about $5 bucks less you could buy Chris Bird's ""The Concealed Handgun Manual"" and be better off. The only thing that is any good in this book is the recertification test. The course of fire is fairly generic as well. Overall, this is more of a ""initial"" CCW manual than anything for advanced information."
3,Bob and Joan and Mimi and Richard,"My Hadju has very little sympathy for any of the characters in this narrative. In his view, Bob is a self-centered jerk, Joan is priggish, Mimi is callow and Richard is a self-promoting charlatan who probably needed medical intervention. Mr. Hadju's only sympathies lie with Mimi who is little and beautiful and sorely used. Oh please. What I found missing was any sense of forgiveness for just how young they were. Only Richard can be held accountable for his caddish behavior because he was older and should have known better. The others were all painfully young and their behavior, reprehensible, naive, touching and all should be interpreted through the highly charged haze of youth. I doubt that anyone's life could withstand this level of strutiny at the age of 22.I am not a fan of Mr Hadju's writing style, but the book is packed with information."
3,Positively ... a let down,"I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to learn about the folk scene during the early Dylan, Baez, Farina years (before discovering the folk scene in the middle to late 60's myself). Instead, I found a lot of mush ... Joanie thought she was unattractive (in retrospect hard to believe, really .. positively!); Bobby was/is an opportunist; Farina making it with established folkies, or their sisters, just to advance his career; and Mimi ... oh Mimi ... you were the only pure one ... at least according to Hajdu! Close to a tabloid biography of the times. It did, however, re-spark my interest in the period music. That's worth something!"
1,Positively Don't Bother,"""Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times..."" reads like a hatchet-job on Dylan and Baez; an ain't she sweet love poem to Mimi Baez-Farina; and tainted hagiography for Richard Farina. I don't think any of us in our callow youth would fare much better as personalities, the problem with this book is that Mr. Hajdu doesn't have much of a feeling for the art that came out despite the creepiness of the milieu. It's a problem he shares with Howard Sounes's ""Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan."" Both books rank as over-inflated tabloid fodder. As far as giving us a feeling for the Greenwich Village folk scene - well, we catch a whiff of its seedier aspects, but Mr. Hajdu hasn't been able to find much joy in it all. If you'd like to check out a well written, critical biography of the troubled and talented Bob Dylan, I'd suggest, ""Behind the Shades: Take Two,"" by Clinton Heylin."
2,Been Down So Long This Reads Like Garbage,"This book reads like a gossip column. The only difference is that the author reveals his sources. The idea is sound: use data from hundreds of interviews and write a non fiction novel from the point of view of a fly on the wall. It simply does not work. The people whose lives and relationships are now being scrutinized produced some of the best music and literature that their generation had to offer. Instead of praising them, though, Hajdu seems to want to destroy the myth by exposing the baser sides of their personalities.Spend 20 bucks on something by one of these four that you don't already own rather than buying this."
2,Where's the music?,This book reads like an extended version of people magaizine. Might be good if you are interested in gossip but has little insight regarding folk music and the artists discussed in the book.Very disappointing and ultimately tedious.
3,Positively ... inadequate?,"As one who joined the folk scene in the late 1960's, I was looking forward to learning what I had missed in the earlier part of the decade. Thus, I had high hopes for this book and I really wish I could give it more stars. (Perhaps 3 is a bit harsh, and it's closer to -- but less than -- 4). The book held my interest, but I always felt that I was getting more gossipy, superficial information than a real sense of how these four individuals waltzed through and impacted the 60's folk scene and the larger world. I.e., the author seems fixated on whether Joanie thought she was unattractive, Dick/Richard was on the make only to further his career, Bobbie was an opportunist --which leaves only Mimi unscathed -- but naive? Come on, there's more to life, history and respect for individuals than is offered here. (In retrospect, perhaps it is much closer to a 3 star book.) Sorry."
4,farina and dylan with the baez's,a very specific subject of the relationship of joan and mimi baez with the two early loves of their lives during the 60's. an interesting book that details the rise of dylan in accordance with the already established career of joan baez and the disappointment she felt when he left her to move on by himself without her anymore.
5,It's good to see this CD still available,I understand this was Andrew Lawrence-King's debut recording (as a soloist anyway) and it's a very impressive one. I read him described somewhere as possibly the world's greatest living musician on ANY instrument and I have to admit I wouldn't argue with such a statement. He is a very expressive (and often quite passionate) player. Certainly no other harpist can create sounds like this.
4,A Review of Harp Music of the Italian Renaissance,"Beautiful music, well played. I bought this disc after hearing the 2 Negri pieces on spinner.com. The remaining tracks live up to the excellence of those 2 pieces. Good stuff."
3,AVAST ME LUBBERS..THEY BE BLOOD AND WINE!!

3,Blocks View of Speedometer and Other Gauges,"It's a nice, elastic-fit, steering wheel cover. However, it extends inward about 1.5 inches beyond the rim of the steering wheel and blocks my view of the speedometer and other gauges. Check how close your line of sight (to the instrument cluster) is to the inside of the steering wheel rim before buying this type of cover."
2,An Obscure Compilation from Chet Baker,"A very obscure set of poor recordings. Possibly bootleg recordings from European sessions in 1961 at a time when Chet was playing fast and hard to overcome some adverse French reaction to an ""effete"" style. I cannot find this set of titles anywhere in any Discography! A little suspect this one."
3,Good for the price but no documentation at all,"Picture and music quality is somewhere between ok and good - inmy eyes above average for cheap Jazz DVDs. What I really miss is some information when these recordings where made. If you do not expect too much (which I didn't), you won't be dissatisfied. After all I enjoyed watching the discs."
5,A Must Read For Anyone Who Wants To Understand Civil Rights,"David Chappell's study of the role of white Southerners in the Civil Rights movement is fascinating. While not denying that black activists were the real movers and shakers, Chappell shows that we can't understand why the movement succeeded without understanding the role of white Southerners. He quotes Andrew Young, King's right hand man, as saying that without the white Southerners who helped out the movement, the movement would have failed. Chappell shows that the movement succeeded in places where white Southerners, wittingly and unwittingly, cooperated with the civil rights activists, and failed in places like Albany, Georgia, where they did not. But the best part is that Chappell is such a great writer! If you want to know something about the Civil Rights movement, read this book."
4,a great CD to relax with.,"I'm not a dedicated follower of Deepak, although I remember him showing up on Oprah from time to time years ago. This CD came to my attention and I decided to buy it. I'm really glad I did. I can't really describe the music, but it is very interesting and unique. I listen to it while driving and it keeps me calm and balanced on bumpy and crowded New Jersey streets. If you can handle and appreciate new-agey music, then you should check this out."
4,Well-written a a pleasant read,"Being a fan of Buckley's columns, I decided to give his spy novels a try. This is his first and the only one I've read so far, but I plan on reading more. Its plot is nothing to write home about, but it is never boring, occasionally humorous, and always interesting. And of course, Buckley's incredible use of the English language is ever present. But don't worry about having to pull out your dictionary every few minutes to understand what's going on, although it can help."
4,A fun spy novel.,"Blackford Oakes, CIA operative, is sent to Great Britian to track down a spy who is passing nuclear secrets to the Soviets. It's his first mission, and it's definitely an unusual one (OK, all of Blacky's missions are unusual). I've read all of Buckley's Blackford Oakes series and each is fun and entertaining. Each details an interesting theory/fantasy into a particular piece of history; each seems fairly plausible. I recommend all of WFB's spy novels. Read one and you'll find that you're hooked."
3,"Saving, indeed!","This book belonged to my dad and he gave it to me to try out. What a fun, preposterous story! Buckley sure seemed to enjoy poking his finger in the eye of the British. He is particularly prankish in how he has his protagonist, Blackford Oakes, years later return the favor of a lashing Blackford receives in his youth. An enjoyable novel you can put away over a weekend."
2,Buckley is Buckley,"Blackford Oakes is an avatar of the Buckley deity, just too good to be true. The writing is B- college creative writing course. The queen et al are gratuitous. It's readable but you could spend your time better. I read it at the request of a friend who, I think, liked the birching better than anything....um...."
3,"unusual, funny and pathetic","I liked this book; it is informative and funny, but the ending is overpathetic."
3,just acceptable,It lack form and great detail and its too general in term. I was looking for more forms and specific detail to meet my needs.
3,true description,"This is a good item simple to understand and follow, but it is more useful to someone just starting the ISO process. The format is geared toward writing policies instead of use as a reference to the standard."
4,Zeke's newest and best,"Blazing riffs, machine-gun drumming, screaming mad vocals... everything a truely great punk record should be made of. Tracks such as ""Nightrider"" and ""Crossroads"" show Zeke as a progressive outfit exploring new grounds with speed-metalish melodies and solos, whereas ""Live Wire"", ""Eyes of Satan"", and ""Mountain Man"" (among others) are reminiscent of the devastatingly headbangable likes of earlier Zeke albums.Only two minor complaints: 1) Zeke really need to make longer albums, and 2) I liked Blind Marky's more raspy tone of voice he had on ""Dirty Sanchez"". He takes a slightly smoother approach here.This isn't to say the album doesn't render weakling wannabe punk groups like Blink 182 and Good Charlotte utterly worthless, because it does. Buy it and rock on."
3,"Good Album, But Slayer still is the best!","I admit I am a Slayer fan of at least 12 years. Upon the reviews on this board, I bought this album in hope of something so crazy, so extreme, so goulish, so haunting, that I would put my slayers cds down for this album. It did not happen, at all. Zeke is good, fast, and agressive, but not even close to slayer."
5,hers lucy season 1,"one of the best comedys ever made, if u love ""lucy"" then watch this show its her best !!!!!!!!Here's Lucy: Season One"
2,Not Ball's finest hour. Just OK.,"Lucille Ball's third venture into sitcom land marked her last successful TV show. The flaming redhead was now playing a widow with two teenagers.The tried and true situations written for her were getting stale. For the start of the 1968 Fall TV season, 57 year-old Ball was getting old. Even her heavy makeup and elaborate wigs could not hide her age. Nolonger would she allow to be filmed closeup. Any funny facial expressions she was known for in ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Lucy Show"" were a rarity on this dated show. A slew of weekly guest stars, Ball's children and old fart co-star, Gale Gordon is what carried this show for its 6 year run.The Arnaz kids, Lucie & Desi Jr. inherited the show upon their mom's death. It spent many years on and off in reruns. Some bad prints have even been bootlegged prior to this legit release. Rather than let the tapes collect dust, the Arnazes found another way to cash on them yet again."
3,growing pains,"Lopsided matches and brute power, with a lack of discipline in all but one contestent, champion Royce Gracie, make for a weaker, but sometimes exciting UFC. The combatants have greatly improved over the years, but this early tape is a good view if only for that reason, to see how much the sport has developed."
4,old school,this video is far far better than the first ufc. this video is also the start of the legendary fred ettish fetal position. pat smith at his finest. i guess ninjitsu didn't work to well against him....
3,Great Phono preamp for cartriges with lower output,This preamp was great until I started using my Ortofon Arkiv cartridge. The higher output of the cartridge made the preamp clip the audio signal. Because of this I was losing sound when digitizing vinyl. Since there is no volume control I could not over come the problem and had to go with another with volume control. Please keep that in mind when buying this product.
2,not worth the money,"we bought this product, attempted to put it together only to find that 2 pieces were BROKEN! The company was VERY responsive and great about refunding or exchanging, but in the end we got something different"
5,A Little Bit of UFO History,"1997 was a festival year for UFOs. The great Roswell crash was celebrated for its 50th anniversary. In response, the U.S. Air Force conducted a re-investigation of Roswell, concluding (not surprisingly) that the cause of the crash was merely a secret balloon project to detect Soviet nuclear explosions. This video is one of many new volumes archiving the variety of films created or collected by the Air Force during this investigation. It is a rare insight into the government's own consideration of the phenomenon, whether or not you agree with the conclusions."
4,"Not EXACTLY what I was hoping for, but will do.","I was looking for a Daddy/Daughter book to give my husband as a keepsake ""from"" our 10month old for his first Father's Day. Only the first and last pages depict a father and daughter, while the rest of the pages show animals with their offspring. I knew this when I purchased it, but I couldn't find any other book at the time that was a better fit for what I wanted. Nevertheless, the book is beautifully illustrated and the writing is very sweet. I put my daughter's hand and footprint inside the back cover, and of course my husband loved it. I just thought that going to animals after the first page was kind of random."
5,one of my favorites,"I love children's books and always give books for baby gifts instead of clothes. ""I love my Daddy"" and I love my Mommy"" makes a great combination gift. The pictures are lovely and the words are something children and parents can relate to. The whole concept of parents taking care of and playing with and teaching their children can never be retold too many times. Clever use of animal parents instead of the typical pictures of humans."
5,Great for child and dad,I got this for my daughter to give her dad for Father's Day. I love to hear them read it together. I would recommend it for any child and their dad.
5,Richly illustrated and very endearing,"This is a great book showing a host of animals in their natural habitat. The rich illustrations show each animal's distinctive characteristic, which are succinctly described in relation to being a father. The text for the beaver page, for example, says, ""I love my daddy because he can build a house."" It's a sweet book, sure to touch any father's heart."
5,He is strong and brave too!,"I love this book, and I love my Mommy for buying it for Daddy and me. My Daddy does great things like the ones in the book because he builds things, and he is strong and brave!"
4,Notice to First Edition Buyers.,"Here's notice for interested First Edition buyers of ""I Love My Daddy Because"" 0525446249An altogether lovely book age-appropriate book. Perfect for Father's Day. BUT if a lst edition is important to you, don't rely on the accuracy of this listing. What you receive is a 1996 re-issue from Amazon.Trying to get that info across to customer service is like banging your head on a wall. Rather than be sent 2-3 more copies of the same re-issue because customer service believes with unshakeable faith that this listing HAS to be right. Which I would then have have to return. And spend more time and bother than I wish on the matter. As has happened before. Here's a heads up to buyers. It's also 20 pages, not 2."
5,Deck Shield Netting,"Deck Shield Netting, Clear, 15 Feet x 35 InchesGreat Product! very easy to staple to your deck railing. Very secure and safe. Its nice it does not block your view too much."
1,Not Impressed,"I bought this cologne based on all the good reviews, but I have to say I'm not that impressed with it. It's not bad, but I have found that the fragrance doesn't seem to last long. Several hours into the night I can't even smell it on me. I even tried putting more of it on me, thinking that I just didn't use enough but it still didn't last long.I wish I could find something that smells more like Jovan's Andron. Not that I believe pheromones work, Andron just smelled great."
4,Quick Response,"Ordered this product through the Amazon ""link"" to seller process. The seller provided accurate information regarding receipt of my order, expected shipping date and costs and the delivery method. No problems were experienced with its delivery. The product came as specified at the excellent sale price and this has been a successful experience as the product received was exactly as expected. Enjoy!!!"
1,POOR AROMA,This parfume is not really what I expected. I bought it in AAA Merchants because I saw the good comments about it; but when I used the aroma is gone in ten minutes. I wasted my money.
4,This is a good product ... but...,The acquired product is really good and the delivering time was ok.I have only one comment: The product that I received did not match to the announced product. Please look at the picture. You can see TWO products in the ad ... but I only received one of them (the bigger).
2,"SPRAY, mislabeled as ""splash""","Drakkar's worked for me for decades, but I really wanted the control of the splash bottle. Amazon delivered the spray."
4,great deal,you will not find a more sutable price on a substantial amount to purchase such as this one...buy it now
1,Don't buy from Amazon,"If you buy the real thing, the longevity is not a problem.It lasts over 6 hours.Amazon does not verify the legitimacy of the stores it imports from, so if you buy on here, there is a big chance you will buy fakes. Try Ebay or Fragrancenet instead.As for the scent itself, it is a classic, but not for everybody. It's woodsy with lemon and a little bit of lavendar. It is very strong, and overpowering if you spray it. It seems dated as most colognes now are more for a fresh light fragrance than a strong masculine one."
1,Cologne leaks by the cap; disappointing,Cologne leaks by the cap; disappointing. Although the scent is great it really doesn't help when the container is flawed.
5,Drakkar Noir,"I consider Drakkar Noir to be a ""tailored"" cologne made for special occassions. This has always been a favorite of my husband. At a recent party several women came over to him to get a whiff of his cologne. He enjoyed the attention, so I know there will always be a bottle of it on his dresser."
5,cologne,I received this product very quick and it was easy to order. The product was packaged good and it was not damaged.
3,Decent smell but doesn't last,"It smells nice (just like you remember) but fades quickly and isn't worth it. I bought this for something cheap to wear to work but will go back to wearing Paco Rabanne's 1 Million (way stronger and better!). Spend the extra cash, trust me."
1,This is a counterfeit product DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS MERCHANT,"This cologne is great, I've wore it for years, however this merchant is selling a counterfeit product. Typically i can put this on and the smell last all day and i can even pick up my shirt the next day from my floor and still smell it. BUT, this merchants COUNTERFEIT product doesn't last 30mins. Thanks for ripping me off of my hard earned money buddy!!!"
3,Drakkar Noir Review,"Great smelling cologne but horrible longevity. You'll get 3 to 4 hours at most out of this cologne, what a disappointment. I must admit though for a relatively inexpensive cologne you definitely get a bang for your buck. overall it is OK if the scent lasted longer it would be my favorite cologne... But it doesn't."
1,Fake product,"The authentic Drakkar Noir scent is awesome. I have worn it for years. As one of the reviewers reports, it is like catnip fo the ladies. I recently purchased a bottle of the Drakkar Noir from Amazon.com. Unfortunately, I recieved a cheap knockoff not even close to the authentic Drakkar Noir scent. Then I discovered that Amamzon.com return policy does not allow a return for flamable goods. I have asked for a refund but we will see. Probably a totally wasted $50 because I aint gonna wear that trash."
5,Great Classic,Smells mild and clean. Never overpowering. Also has staying power. Lasts all day. Women love it too! I don't use anything else! Aftershave balm is also great!
4,Great Value!,I've never found such a great deal! Excellent price for big quantity of this classic frangrance.
4,Great smelling cologne.,"This is a great smelling cologne. Wish the smell could stay longer than 4-hours on your clothes and body. The women love this smell and my peers ask what cologne is that, obcourse I keep-it a secret, LOL. All in all it is great cologne. I will buy-it again as soon as this large bottle is done."
2,Drakkar,"I""ve been using Drakkar for a while but for some reasonthis one doesn""t last like the other ones in the past.Not too happy with it."
2,"SPRAY, mislabeled as ""splash""","Drakkar's worked for me for decades, but I really wanted the control of the splash bottle (my last 6.7oz splash bottle, used almost daily, lasted fourteen years). Unfortunately, even though the title (when purchased) said ""Drakkar Noir Eau de Toilette Splash"", Amazon delivered the spray."
4,Just Barely Works Well...,"Yes, it works well, but just barely fits over my raw water intake cover. I was looking for a plunger style hose connection since my boat has a large brass grate over the intake rather than being threaded for a garden hose. This product is well constructed and the adjustable height setting works well, but the plunger just barely covers the grate and does not create a perfect seal, but its definitely good enought to serve its purpose. Make sure you measure your intake to see if this will fit before buying. This was the largest diameter I could find, I wish they made a bigger one."
5,Moeller boat motor flusher,"Product arrived very quickly. It is very easy to use and works well. I have a straight inboard ski boat, adjustable mast was easy to adjust and sealed agains hull well"
5,Great Product,This thing works great. I love the twist lock action. The lock makes it easy and quick to adjust and there is pretty good quality in here.
1,Disappointed,"I've been looking for lamps of this scale for some time, so I was thrilled to find these. I liked that they were gilded and, while not so concerned with price, the price seemed great: over $140 off the MSRP. That should have been my first clue. These lamps are not made of wood or metal. They are made of resin. Are they gilded? Gilded by the definition of ""covered in a thin layer of gold or silver leaf""? Doesn't look like it to me - looks like paint. I think they meant gilded as in ""having a deep brownish or gold color,"" which they do in a manufactured way. No where on the description did these say they were made of resin. If looks are all you care about, then these might be a good fit for you. On a positive note (the one star), the shades are a nice shape. Overall, the bases look cheap and I'm sending them back. If it matters to you, FYI: the lamps are made in China."
3,athroom ceiling fan and light,Looks very good on ceiling. The fan does the job it should. The glass cover on the light allows very little light to come through making the light part almost worthless.
2,Bathroom Fan with a high noise impedment rating?,"I've had this fan for almost two years. It was installed when my bathroom was remodeled. I liked the idea of a 'good looking' light fixture coupled with a extremely high 'noise impedance' level fan. However, for the past year and a half, I have suffered with a noise level that rivals the $19.95 ceiling fan that it replaced.Hunter led me to believe by it's advertisements that this fan would be 'whisper quiet' and at the same time move a large amount of air. Not True!This fan is not only almost as noisy as it predecessor (that cost under $20) but it takes forever to move 'shower steam' from the room let alone foul odors. I'm sorry but I feel I wasted my money on the Hunter 82023 Belle Meade Bathroom Fan & light.Oh, by the way, they don't have a 'customer satisfaction' guarantee!"
3,Jungle out there for Nano!,"This book is a good summary of 100+ companies in the nanotechnology business. It was published in 2006. Already many firms disappeared. Even with the Merrill Lynch nanotech index on p. 264, there is no sure way to make money. Nano is similar to biotech early stages. Companies spent millions of research dollars on nano, yet at the end, the return on investment is unknown. This is a big challenge for entrepreneurs. Many more research and books will be written in this field. Stay tuned..."
2,Bouncing,"It jumps a lot, I tried several ways of installing it. I adjusted location, even tried to put a second reducer to dampen out any pulses. I tried a couple different signal wire types, and needless to say it still jumped all over the place. I purchased the Sunpro mechanical oil pressure gauge and it works great, although I did have to run an oil line into the car."
5,the great ricer,"We just love the ricer it made mashed potatoes much more flaverful, easy to clean just pop it in the dishwasher good to go. This one is easy to close handeles works great less effort, I recomend this model to any one."
3,Mediocre,"I found this butter dish to be pretty, but when I take it out of the refrigerator, it is hard for me to remove, the top!"
1,Terrible!,"Do not buy this book! It is very poorly organized, often referring to figures and concepts in other chapters. The index is paltry, having very few terms indexed and therefore making looking things up very difficult. In addition, there are multiple typos. This is like the 7th edition and there are still typos?!? Let's get serious here. Also, there are no explanations to the answers! The text in general is leaves much to be desired in terms of organization and clarity. Again, maybe you don't get around to it on edition 1 or 2-- but by now, write some explanations (especially since the text is so hard to understand). I conferred with classmates on opinions of this book, and they all agreed at how poor this book is! Look elsewhere for a resource!"
3,Good Enough,"I used this book to study pulmonary during my second year of medical school. It was a good book and it helped clarify a lot of the physical mechanics behind ventilation. However, I felt like it was very wordy. I like the ""a picture is worth a 1000 words"" approach to learning, so I felt that the paragraphs were too wordy and that the graph's captions did not explain enough. However, it was extremely helpful and a great study guide."
2,Not useful for medical school.,"This book might be a good review text for people who are already familiar with the material, but it can't be used as a stand-alone text. It just doesn't have the necessary explanations. I'd recommend sticking with the respiratory chapters in your favorite comprehensive medical physiology textbook."
2,Too complex,"I got this book free from a friend. This book was too complex for me in med school and is still too complex for me as an intern interested in Pulm Medicine. Stick with your school's curriculum to understand the concepts as best you can, like I did. I read reviews for another book entitled Respiratory Physiology: A Clinical Approach (Integrated Physiology) by a different author. I was so impressed by 10 5-star ratings for this book, I decided to purchase it now to regain better insight into pulm physiology. I wish I came across this book while in school. I'm purchasing it today, will go through it this June, and write a thorough review for it. As for John West's book on pulm physiology, save your money."
2,"Mediocre review book, terrible textbook","I have revised my review of this book. I first gave it 1-star.As a textbook, it is horrible; far too short, abbreviated explanations, not enough/poor pictures for visual learners, too many graphs, etc. In the preface, the author does state that this book can be used as an ""introductory textbook."" I'm sorry, but I strongly disagree.He also says it can serve as a review book. As a review book, it is okay, and although I think there are better books out there, I do find myself referring to this book occasionally.A painful read. And yes, I read the entire book, cover-to-cover."
3,Half of book was upside down,Part of the book was bound in reverse. I just would have like to have known ahead of time. Other wise the book is good condition and it came promptly.
5,Great for quick review,"Our syllabus for the respiratory course was pretty poor. I found this book to be a great, quick review for respiratory physiology with pictures/diagrams that were really helpful for solidifying important concepts. I'm definitely going to hang on to it to study for boards..."
5,Valuable resource,"America's Australia is a significant contribution to the literature on the subject, providing the best analysis of an important but often ignored relationship. This book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone interested in this topic"
3,Royal Worcester not made in England,No where in the description did you state that the china was now being made in Thailand. There was a less refined feel to the china and a slight difference in size of cup and plates. It was disappointing to see that the china was not the same quality as previously made in England.
1,Completely unreadable,"""Evolution of Consciousness"" is an almost unreadable collection of lectures by Rudolf Steiner, given in Wales at the end of his life. Don't bother with it. It will just give you a headache. One star!"
3,Not bad for price,"Bought one two summers ago. Only initial issue was that the feed adjustment for controlling the amount of fertilizer to spread is pretty crude. I mostly just eye-balled the spread myself and forgot about reading the guage. The spreader worked fine the first summer, needed a little WD-40 the second summer and now, the 3rd summer, I'm tossing it. Enough rust finally messed up the gears and the wheels lock up. For the price I paid ($55), 2 years is ok."
2,Customer Service Lacking,The pull behind lawn spreader works good for the price. But trying to get all the parts of it delivered was another story! Customer service would not return calls or e-mails and would not give me answers when the parts would be available.
2,"Very imported,","After assembly, you relize that the product is imported. Will meet my needs, but if you plan to use this product on a large property (1 acre lots or larger)shop some more."
1,junk,"this speader is junk! used it 3 times on lawn and the gears are locked up,wheels wont turn junk junk junk"
1,Does not last,"This unit worked well at first, but after a year of service as one other reviewed stated the gears don't stay meshed and the spreader stops spinning and the product just dribbles out the opening. The gears are sealed in a cheap plastic housing and cannot be maintained without destroying the housing. Another case of stupid design.Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews on this unit until long after I had bought the unit. I sent a letter of complaint to agri-fab but they just ignored it. So I will buy a commercial grade spreader from someone reliable."
1,Flimsy Toy,"I used the Agri Fab Broadcaster today to put down Turfbuilder with halts. It worked good for about 100 feet, then the fertilizer stopped coming out. I tried several times, but after driving for a while, I would look back and nothing was coming out. I am going to buy a real broadcaster now. You get what you pay for."
1,Junk,"This is a piece of junk the gears went out after only using it a few times.I bought it from Lowes a year ago, and wish I could get my money back I paid $129 for nothing."
1,Do not buy this piece of junk,I've had one of these for about 2-3 years. Last year the gears locked up (they are made of cheap plastic). Going over 2 mph will burn them out. The controls move all over the place making the spread rate vary each time you use it. I am currently looking for a good quality replacement.
1,Can I rate it Any Lower? Please?,"Ooof! I got suckered in on the price, and quite frankly, as one who has unwillingly been relegated to doing his own lawn maintenance due to the lack of professional results (in other words, I do because I must, not because I want to be out there over-doing lawn maintenance every weekend), this unit should have been just fine.I literally used it 3 times on my paltry 1 acre and the spreader stopped working. I've learned since then that this is because it has a plastic differential which is prone to stripping out early on. Make sure you buy a spreader that does not have a plastic differential. If there is a saving grace, it comes with two good tires that you can strip off before inserting the rest of the unit in the trash. Steer clear of this one at all costs."
1,Poor choice,Almost two days of assembly and I still had to return it. A cheap price for a cheap product can mean money wasted and not money saved. Spend a little more and buy something a lot better.
4,So Crazy Man! Another '50s-'60s mix but with some unusual stuff,"All terrific tracks but one: that wonderful never-should-have-been-released recut of THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT, probably cut in Nashville in late 1964. Has some interesting proto-funk guitar but...what a wierd choice.Note undubbed 1956 SHAKE A HAND *and* the collector-friendly, BONIE MARONIE, live at the Domino, in Atlanta Georgia, 1 December 1965. For this Reviewer, the reason for the **** star rating.Can you back-catalogue CD producers check out the public domain list for this super Legend? Man!!"
3,average,"we just recently purchased this for our three and a half month old, while the toy attachments are darling, and our son absolutley loves the giraffe!! and the assembly was pretty easy, and it folds away which is a big plus!!you can move the toys for time on back and ""tummy time"". all in all biggest complaint is that the mat will bunch up under a wiggly baby"
5,Fabulous,This toy is fabulous. My son loved it. He started playing with it at about 3 months and still plays with the items they just aren't attached anymore. It is annoying that the material bunches up but we just took it off or put a changing mat underneath if we needed additional padding. I would definitely recommend this toy. It is one of the better gyms out there.
2,Disappointed after the first few weeks,"I bought this baby gym with a giftcard for the birth of our second child. I was estatic when she, at 6 weeks old, seemed to love to lay under it and look at the dangling toys. That excitement was short lived, however, as while the gym is set up, the toys bend with gravity toward the floor, making it very difficult for the baby to see and play with. I would even go so far as to remove them each time she was done so they could ""morph"" back into their true form, which never really happened. After awhile the gym part was put into storage and the toys simply scattered on the floor for my baby to play with.I would NOT recommend this gym to new parents - go for the link gym instead. I have one of those from my cousin (10 years old) and was able to hang all kinds of toys from it with links I purchased at the store with MUCH more and longer lasting success."
2,disappointed,"we literally just received this as a gift for our 3 month old, and we expected more from fisher price. we were so disappointed in fact, that i hopped up to write this review. NO padding. when arch is up there is nothing to secure the mat to to prevent it from riding up under our wriggley baby boy."
2,Didn't work,"The cable I received didn't work at all. It might be worth the gamble anyway, because if you get one that works it's a great deal. If not, you're only out a couple bucks."
5,Same as the expnsive ones,We bought the expensive cables when we first got our blu-ray. I can tell zero difference with those expensive ones and this one. Get it!
2,Maybe,Didn't work with the setup i was trying to finish. I could not tell if it was the cord or the receiver i was attempting to connect to regardless I can't say for sure.
5,Priced right!!!,Every review I read says there is no difference in hdmi cables. I believe those reviews Why pay outrageous prices at retail stores? If they really served your interests they would carry these dabbles. Buy these and give what you save to your kids or to charity
1,Poor build quality,"Despite what Monster cable will tell you, all HDMI cables deliver the same quality video and audio. The only real factor to consider is build quality, and this cable is of the poorest quality. If you want a super-cheap cable to hide in a wall and never touch, this is a good pick. If this cable will be anywhere near people, go for a better cable! Most cables have a 1 piece metal connector, so if you yank on it a bit, it won't break. This cable has a two piece connector, and the two pieces are not attached securely! This means that a tiny yank will pill the cheap connector out of the cable and break it. Do yourself a favor and spend $2 more on a cable that won't break so easily."
3,Good price delayed Sound,"These cables have a good quality video but in my case my sound gets delayed by about a half second. I use mine from my computer to my TV, I don't know if there are similar results going from a DVD or bluray to the TV. But I bought 3 of these and still glad that I did."
3,not 4 blu-ray,bought this 4 connection to my sony blu-ray 360 but it would not transmitt a signal--switched it with my HDMI cable 4 my cable connection & it works fine--not capable of 1080 signal
2,They work...for a while,"I've had these cables for about a year, I ordered 2. I just had one fail on me and the other seems to be going strong. I'm very dissapointed I would never expect a cable to fail, just possibly not work when I got it."
5,Does everything as described,Works perfect. Couldn't find anything wrong yet. Great price. I needed this cable to hook up my Roku 2 HD to my HD TV
4,Good,"Does what it's suppose to do, no problems with it! Recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive HDMI cable. Good buy."
1,5 of the 7 episodes are repeats from Series 1 & 2,"The ONE Star has nothing to do with the quality of the programs. I am absolutely a HUGE Doc Martin fan and cannot get enough of the show, which is why I eagerly ordered Series 3. I hunkered down for a jolly old Doc Martin marathon, thorougly relishing the first two episodes, then was dismayed and stunned to discover the third episode of Series 3 was a repeat from my Doc Martin Series 1 or 2 DVDs! Then again it happened on the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh episodes! If you already own the Series 1 & 2 DVDs and don't mind spending $30 for only TWO episodes you've not seen, then by all means go for it; the two new episodes, like all the others, are a delight. It is of note that one of the two ""new"" episodes ought to have been shown much earlier as it introduces, obviously for the first time, the officious narcoleptic/agoraphobic village policeman we met early on (probably in Series 1) who was later replaced by gentler ""Mark""."
1,Doc Martin - Great Series - But Victim of December 24 Viewing Problem,"We love the Doc Martin series. Unfortunately, video service on December 24 was affected by some kind of system problem. Our video froze up and we weren't able to view it."
2,"'Northern Exposure' for England, but not as good.","I've been catching this series lately in America on PBS. I find it to be a lame UK version of our famous ""Northern Exposure"" tv series from the early 1990's.This version is like it - city doc transplanted to the outskirts (though not as remote or as quirky as our NYC doc sent to Alaska); stories are somewhat similar but less humorous and certainly less relevant, and this version has the doc's aunt in residence. Still it's nowhere near as good nor as entertaining as ""Northern Exposure""."
2,"Just like the first two series, but tinged with a few more disgusting bits","Auntie Joan screwing the young man in her kitchen? BARF!The doctor running over a dog with his car and then carrying it around in a newspaper? Oh, yeah, that's a scream.And the end of the series is...disappointing, to say the least. And yet totally predictable, as this show seems to disappoint more than entertain.Okay, it has its funny moments, but then something so GROSS will happen and you think, why am I watching this? It's SO contrived!I will say, the fictional Portwenn is a GORGEOUS little village. I'd love to live there."
1,"not recieved, received 2 of Season 2 instead","I received 2 of season 2 instead, and sent one back. I have since bought this season in B&N"
1,Gratuitous violence toward animals,"Gratuitous violence toward animals.Warnng: ""The GP always rings twice"" contains a scene of outlandish disregard for animal life. The bumbling Doc Martin drives his car over a helpless Yorkie and crushes the small animal to death beneath his 4,000-pound luxury car. One of the unwritten rules of drama is that you don't kill dumb animals to progress your simplistic and indifferent plot. Sadists among us already prey upon helpless domesticated animals without the cheer leading and encouragement of TV shows like this. If the producers have no better sense of proportion and sensitivity,they should be blackballed from ever producing their violent-endorsing drivel on the unsuspecting public again. Cancel this monstrosity of so-called entertainment before it offends us again."
3,A repeat of Series 2 final episode,"I love LOVE this show, but this episode is just a repeat from the final episode of the previous season (which is why I gave it 3 stars). Al Large is no longer on the show (went to S. America) and PC Milo has left Portwnn & has been replaced by a ""supercop"". Not that there's anything wrong with these changes, I'm just hoping to see Al and Milo again in future episodes."
5,Best show on DVD,I have just finished Season 5. I am in anticipation that there will be 6th fantastic acting by entire cast
5,A different side of Martin,"Season 3 brings us a different side of Martin's personality. He has an opportunity to finally express his feelings for the object of his affections, without diagnosing her. But it's about so much more -- the rich characters of the community are nearly as key as Martin himself. Although, I still have to wonder why the wondering girls aren't in school or looking for jobs of their own."
3,Not Ceramic,"These aren't ceramic pads.....Hawk makes some but these aren't them. Think they come in a yellow box. Change your description Amazon. By the way, Don't have it yet, how can I rate it."
4,Floating Matress,"I bought this mattress because I wanted one big enough that I could lay on in our pool without hanging over and hitting the sides of the pool. It works great. I gave it a 4 because it needs to be in different colors. As my wife says, it's ugly but it works good."
3,What were they thinking?!!!,"O.K., I like Ikaika. He is a very talented singer. Bryan is great, too, and just seems like a really nice guy on top of it all. (I'm not a Mike fan, never got into Matt, and don't know a thing about Jonas) But now, I just have to ask: ""What were they thinking?!!!"" I think that in every interview I have read on these guys, they insist that they are going for a more mature audience. They say time and again that they're not a ""boy band"". So help me understand how ""Juliet"" helps them reach more mature audiences or lifts them out of the boy band category?... Honestly, ""Juliet"" is light-hearted and not awful (and I'm sure that Radio Disney is giving them plenty of airtime), but if you're looking for real music... the single ""Juliet"" is not it."
2,Good Back Beat.,I like the back beat of this song. It's good to dance to. My sister listens to it all the time. It's not really my choice of music. But it's good if you like to dance.
1,What?,"Is this a joke? The losers who couldn't get in the worst group in America made their own album? I listened to the songs these guys made and I now understand why they didn't make it into O-Town. And if you can't get into O-Town...you have NO talent. What happened to the Hawaiian guy wanting to become a doctor? His big brother wouldn't let him join O-Town. I guess he was worse in medicine than in singing. They really picked a bad time to make a boy band. Pop music is changing. Backstreet Boys and Nsync aren't selling like they used to. America's youth has gotten bored with them and they're on to the next big thing. MINT, or whatever this group is called, doesn't stand a snowball's chance in Hell."
2,used to think harbinger made quality products,"I bought these gloves because I currently have some of the big grip gloves with wrist strap, and wanted gloves that would be more flexible. The first day I used these gloves one of the grips started becoming unstitched! The pad was halfway off the first day of training in less than 30 minutes! I am also not impressed with harbinger since the last time I bought the ""top of the line"" big grip gloves, within the first couple weeks the seam stitches were coming undone on the right hand glove. However they do make comfortable and very intuitive gloves, but lack quality construction."
2,NOT SATISFIED,Two of the three gloves i bought had defects.The information i get from the product description didn't match with the product itself.
3,Seems OK,"Haven't actually used these yet. They don't seem quite as cool in person as they do by their picture.The size large is pretty small and chafes in all the wrong places.The quality seems decent, but there really isn't much leather.The ""gel"" padding in the palms is pretty skimpy.I reccomend ordering one size larger."
3,Warning: picture is wrong,These gloves are not the gloves in the picture. I had to return them to get the right style... beware.
1,Done with money milking....,"Should have released the extended versions and left these go, or at least released both at the same time, and let people choose."
5,LOR trilogy - great,"Purchased the set for my wife for Chrismas and she loves it. Never seeing the movies before; it is an adventure. Have made time to watch the first two, and looking forward to the third."
5,our family enjoys these movies and the special features. we are so happy to have our own copy of the set.,The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy Special Extended edition is a family favorite in our home. (these movies are not for young children.)
5,Awesome,Loved the books and love the movies. Shakes the room with the action scenes and has some of the most brilliant scenery you will ever find in a movie. Timeless story.
5,Like new,"This set was almost like new just like the description said. However, there are a few scratches on the dvd's that make it go slow or skip. I can deal with that since I paid $30 less than the new set. :)"
3,dvds,"the product was what it was listed as but the quality was not quite the same, the first dvd in the set is scratched and covered in fingerprints & dirt so it jumped and did not play well"
2,Why are they even bothering with theatrical versions??,"I was so pumped to see this notification in my email box but my heart then sank upon seeing it's just theatrical versions! Everyone wants the extended version, they better be coming out with it as soon as possible!"
5,Well worth the money even if you own the theatrical releases,"As the title says, these are worth the money because of the added scenes. 30 min. in film #1, 43 min in film #2 and 50 min in film #3. you might consider these versions the directors cut. The information and insights contained in the footage resolve many questions left unanswered in the theatrical releases. Also the 2 discs (per movie, 12 discs in the set) of extra features are differant than the theatrical releases and in many ways more insightful than those contained in the theatrical releases. Even if you already have the 6 discs of the theatrical versions you won't be disappointed with these!"
1,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of...,"dont have sub titules, its only engkish The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of... The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of..."
2,This product was defective.,"This was a gift & it would have been perfect, except a disc was defective. We have returned it to Amazon & the money was refunded -- all without a hitch, but we have yet to order/receive a replacement. The potential for ultimate awesomeness for the recipient is all there; it was just devastating that it was defective. I'm confident the replacement will be perfect, though."
4,Beautiful boxed set!,"This is a beautiful boxed set of the Lord of the Rings! Great cover art and beautiful dvd case design! One minor complaint - the new documentary features don't add much to the already previously released (and delightful) documentary material. Perhaps this would have been better marketed strictly on the basis of a beautiful, sleek design. The second cds are really superfluous."
1,SHAMELESS MARKETING PLOY FROM NEW LINE,"First of all I love these films, and they deserve five stars. There is no reason why New Line did could not put out the theatrical and extended editions of these films, either at the same time on different editions, or together in the same set (Blu-Ray can handle the capacity). The only reason they didn't is to screw the fans one more time. This could have been a monster Bly Ray hit for New Line, and could have received massive PR. Instead, I think they will obviously not sell in the numbers they were hoping for, and instead I suspect they will be getting a load of bad PR instead. I love these films and love Blu Ray, but will WILL NOT be buying this edition. SHAME ON YOU NEWLINE, SHAME ON YOU."
1,Dumb and dissapointing,"Ok, I'd like to start off saying that Eligha Wood (I don't think I spelled it right) is not a good actor. Viggo Mortenson is a good actor, but not in this. And Sean Aston was good in the Goonies when he was a kid, but now, I can't bare to watch him act. He sucks. Second off, this has a very stupid plot line. Oh we must save a ring because it can destroy the world. Stuuuuuuuuupid. And last off, the movies are either dull or to much crappy phoney fighting. DOn't bash me because I didn't like the series."
1,Wait for the extended version! Don't support this kind of double grab marketing!!,"There is really no reason for this release to even exist. The theatrical versions could exist as an option in the extended release version. New Line has made us all wait far too long to bring LOTR to BluRay and now they bring us only the theatrical versions because they know some of their fans will buy this and then buy the extended release, just as they did with the DVDs. DON'T DO IT! If you want to buy this, fine, but MAKE SURE you don't buy both! It just encourages studios to squeeze their fans for every last dime and the only way to make them stop is to make the ""light"" releases like this a big financial flop for them."
2,Not peppery at all.,"With a name like BLACK PEPPER you'd think it was warm with peppery spices. It isn't. And I just have to say this: when my husband wore it (which he no longer does because I hid it in the linen closet) I really didn't like it at all. No matter how little he wore, it was still too much."
3,Dino Takes Over,"The only album really featuring the QMS sextet -- led by Dino Valenti and with Gary Duncan back in the fold -- is schizophrenic but still memorable. ""Freeway Flyer"" and ""Fresh Air"" really smoke, and ""Cobra"" is a forgotten little gem of John Cipollina's. On the other hand, as Cipollina disappears into the background, and erstwhile nominal leader David Freiberg becomes little more than a footnote, the album also includes enough junk (""The Hat,"" Just for Love"") and quickly dated material (""Gone Again,"" ""Wolf Run"") that you can tell the end is near."
4,Why,Why is this album only available as an import? Fresh Air is a great song from my high school days but Quicksilver's run was on its last legs by this time. For this album to be available at $87 in Oct. 2009 is a sham. Buy their first two records.
3,An absolute must have for the fans of the San Fran sound,"Recorded in Hawaii, this album features legendary sessions keyboardist Niki Hopkins. The sound is definately late 60's! ""(Have another hit of) Fresh Air"" is one of many standouts on the recording. For a flash from the past, this is good addition for the serious collector."
1,It does not last long,"I have this watch for about 3 years. It suddenly stopped two weeks ago. I considered it is battery, but yesterday Tissot called me and explained that they need to change some parts of the watch. It will cost 70 usd. I am disappointed. A Swiss watch to last only 3 year. I am in search for new one, but probably Japanese."
4,critical care made incredibly easy,"A good exercise for review or learning in the critical care area. I found the questions to range from easy through very difficult. Some nurses only work in certain areas of critical care i.e., cardiac, burns, brain trauma, so this offers a chance to gain knowledge in areas other then your expertise. It's so simple to answer a cardiac question if you deal with it day in and day out, but a burn question may really stop you in your tracks. What is best is the answer is always given along with the rationale. Also hints are given if you need them, although I like to try and use that option only when really stumped. I also found there to be quite a lot of questions although some come up more often, which would be the only drawback. Another nice options is you can pick the categories you want and the amount of questions you wish to answer. The animation is an added attraction. It puts a little fun into the study time."
4,Decent,"I liked this CD - it has a lot of good information and is more fun than just reading a book. However, the animations get tedious after a while and I think they slow the review down some.ATTENTION WINDOWS XP USERS - If you have the service pack 2 installed, you may get an error message concerning C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\AUTOEXEC.NT when you try to install the program.I was able to fix the problem easily by right-click + copy the AUTOEXEC.NT file from the C:/WINDOWS/repair folder and then right-click paste to the C:/Windows/System32 folder.More information can be found @ http://www.voyetra.com/site/kb_ftp/3204002.asp orhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;324767&Product;=winxp(There is also a tech support line for the cdrom, but only available Mon-Fri)."
1,Poorly Written. Look Elsewhere,"This is an inferior book. I work in critical care, and this is the weakest of the critical care nursing books I've bought...out of a dozen.The writing is confusing and leaves the reader with more questions than it answers. It's also out of date.Not worth it."
3,critcal care nursing made incredibly easy,missed the mark not a teaching tool the cd is a waste. Their verison for RN is great but some one missed the mark on this one. Out dated on every thing. Use your text book
1,not available yet,why when order this item was i not told it wasnt available yet. Need this item now. If I would have known i could have gotten it from a store. You also say i can not cancel this order. Thanks!
2,THE ULTIMATE LEXICON FOR THE ARISAEMA-PHILE,"THE MEAGER INFORMATION REGARDING THIS FASCINATING GENUS HAS BEEN FINALLY RECTIFIED IN THIS MONUMENTAL MONOGRAPH ON THE GENUS ARISAEMA. NO LONGER IS THIS GENUS RELEGATED TO BRIEF MENTION IN TOMES REGARDING BULBS AND MISTREATED AS DISMAL ESOTERICA.FOR THE BOTANIST AND GARDENER ALIKE, CULTURE AND CULTIVATION, ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECIES AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION ABOUND. A VALABLE ADDITION TO ANY HORTICULTURAL LIBRARY."
3,Not her best work,"I reccommend you read we'll never tell if you are a kayla perrin fan. In an instant had not point, you have to read almost half of the book before it gets interesting, then once you get into it, it ends suddenly. The book ends without answering a lot of questions."
4,emma's pure and magical voice.,"This cd shows Emma's versatility as a Baroque and early music performer. Her pure voice matches the music so well. I really enjoy the song ""You meaner beauties of the night."" This is only one among many cd's which shows Emma's great voice. I highly recommend the Emma Kirkby collection."
4,"Nice music, modest staging","Gretry's comic operas were very popular in France before the revolution. This particular one is quite nice, although not a masterpiece. The music flows easily and there are some very nice arias. The production is modest, even intimate. Quite effective for this opera. The orchestra and the singers look young and they perform beautiful. As long as you don't expect a masterpiece sung and played by the best in the world, this DVD is very enjoyable. Mozart was staying in Paris when this opera was composed. You can hear some Mozart hints here and there. This is the only recording known to me on DVD, which I recommend for those that want to hear and listen to more than the most famous operas. Musically, Gretry reflects the character and the situation with his melodies without exaggerating much. Simple and delicate arias. Worth watching and listening to."
5,The 521 All-Stars,Outstanding book. this is the first book that I have read that focused on smalltown USA and the will and esprit that a town puts into a baseball team. I found the book to be extrememly inspirational and the photography was excellent. Definitely worthy of reading.....I truly enjoyed each and every page.
1,Don't you get bored,"God I'm sick of every band that sounds like this. Frankly, it's the worst thing about Brooklyn. Buy if you really, really like ""dance punk"" and just can't get enough of funky bass with angular guitar.Or that ""Bandages"" song"
1,Worst purchase ever made!!!,"Stay away from this product. Its the worst piece of garbage I have ever ordered online. It is of very poor design and built of very cheap and flimsy material. The toothpaste inside exploded all over the place the first time I tried using it. I didnt even try to send it back, I was so disgusted I just threw it out. This was definitely the dumbest purchase I have made to date."
4,TRACK LISTING (9 MIXES):,"1. Original Force Mix2. Forceful Beats3. Soulful Pellas4. Jazzy M's Who's Got The Boutros Mix5. Morales D'master Mix6. Atfc Shirts Off On The Podium Mix7. 2:45 Am Mix8. Tom Novy Vs Pufo Latin Sensation Remix9. Jay Jay Mix Radio FadeReleased on Salsoul and featuring mixes by David Morales, Lenny Fontana and Tom Novy"
5,Classic House Anthem,"Loleatta Holloway's Sweet Sensation is one of the most sampled tracks, check her out at wikipedia.The mixes are great and her vocal is just superb."
1,crap!!,"this set was crap, i returned it emediatly after opening. all 3blades were loose, very dull, and crazy hard to close. i soo regreted buyn this set , good thing amazon is good on returns"
4,A Child's Voice,"Many times memoirs take on a heavy, philosophical tone. They are so insightful that we lose the fresh, honest conveying memories. The story may be about a young child, but the writing is too mature or preachy - not in this book. Paula's young voice, fears, and dreams came through in a simple, childlike voice. The little things mattered - bedspreads, a tone of voice, hugs or lack of. The littlest of things matter most to children. For some, they mean everything - life, love, who they are.This is a sad story that is told in honest and simple terms. It is powerful without being wordy. It's a touching tale about one girl trying to find a place to belong."
2,Not that captivating,"Memoir is a hard genre to write, and this one does not capture my interest as a reader. Perhaps the writer did not have enough distance from the events, or the writer just couldn't say the hard things that needed to be said because of a fear of hurting family members still alive? The memoir just falls flat."
5,Nice ring,"In the picture it looks like there are some black marble-looking swirls. The actual ring does not have these. It just looks like a gold ring with greyish gold stripes. The ring definately comes at least 1/2 size larger than what you expect after getting sized at the jewelry store. I had read some of the other reviews that said this but still ordered a size 10. When the ring came it was actually a 10 1/2 so I am exchanging it. They are very good about exchanging it. One other thing about this ring that you may be interested in knowing is that there are some faint lines running across the stripes every quarter inch all the way around the ring. you can only see them on the grey stripes and you have to look close, but they are there. Overall a great ring!"
5,great quality,"This is a great ring, with great quality, it also looks more expensive than amazon price."
4,Such a deal!,"I bought this ring at the same time I purchased my wedding band. Great price and a beautiful ring. Personally, I think the Tungsten Carbide is the way to go. Better than Titanium which tends to scratch more. No scratches on this ring and the shine and luster make this ring look way more expensive than it is. Fast shipment and the best ""deal"" I have had in a long time. You will not regret buying this ring."
5,"Great Ring, Great Value !","My finger must have shrunk slightly over the past 13 years because my wedding band was starting to be too loose...it flew off a couple times and I almost lost it. Due to the wide, thin shape of the band I'm not sure if shrinking was an option, so I decided to just tuck my original wedding band in a safe spot and buy a smaller replacement one to wear day-to-day. This is the same width as my original band, and I couldn't be happier with it. Great look and feel. It is a bit thicker/heavier than my original gold band, but I love the feel of it. I agree with some other reviewers that I think it probably runs 1/2-size large, but I compensated for that with my size selection. This is a very sharp-looking ring. I was expecting to pay much more for a replacement, but I didn't have to ! I've used tungsten to weight pinewood derby cars before, but never expected to be wearing tungsten for my wedding band !"
2,Great for almost one year exactly,"I purchased this ring for my husband for our 5 year anniversary last year. It looked great, was comfortable and fit well. Almost a year to the day I ordered it he called me at work to tell me that it had broke. It is now in two pieces. It is so bizzare because it broke it two perfact halves. I can't complain too much since I paid under $50 for it, but I thought it would last more than one year."
4,As expected,The light bulbs were standard off the shelf silverstars as expected. The light is whiter than stock. I recommend them to those who want a budget friendly upgrade.
1,not as advertised,It is not bright as mentioned in the description.Hardly veisable.the original car lights are brighter.i do not recomend any one to buy it.
3,Men pursue the mysterious aleph across Ganymede.,"Very convincing, descriptive environment and entertaining story. A young boy grows up among a group of men assigned to terraform Ganymede's surface. Myths and stories abide concerning the mysterious alien artifact that roams the planet, with no apparent purpose. The object is completely neutral towards men when encountered, not acknowledging their presence in any way. Nothing is known of the object's nature, origin or purpose. A young boy and his father figure set off in pursuit of the elusive artifact, hoping to understand it. Once uncovered, its purpose is surprising and refreshing."
3,Sci-Fi boomtown.,"It's a good layover book, and a decent attempt to transcend sci-fi by addressing crusty themes with new raw material. The aleph is a Macguffin on par with the spice worms, but there's nothing epic about this coming of age novel.If you read it, try to spot the scene 'borrowed' from Hemingway's ""A Moveable Feast.""Interesting political commentary and explanation of capitalism; that is, if you feel socialism is the ultimate human state of equilibrium."
4,Coming of age story with sf elements.,I believed this was originally serialized in Aazing Sories magazine. Anyway the majestic otherwordly backdrop added something to this coming of age story. If you don't like science fiction you can just think of it as being like an Alaskan setting instead of a gas giant's moon. (In fact I almost thought it was Alaska except for the weird animals & mammoth alien machine.) Oh there's also bits about terraforming & advanced alien objects if you do like science fiction.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A is for alien to be hunted.The writing in this book is a bit of a different style, a little more old fashioned feeling compared to a lot of his other work. On a tough, hard to survive on icy moon an alien force lies buried. When the locals realise something is stirring again, a boy and his father take on the task of doing something about it, if life wasn't rough enough for them to start with. This leads to some revelations for those involved."
3,"The remover was an interesting idea, and works ...","The remover was an interesting idea, and works well if all you paint is your fingernails. But it's not conducive to removing paint from your toenails, as you can't put your toe in the jar. But it worked great for my fingers."
5,Cutex nail polish remover &#128133;,"I always use Cutex, I haven't used the Cotten ball in probably 10 or more years! Cutex is so much easier to use, no mess, and if you mess up 1 nail you don't have to worry about ruining the rest of them, just pop the one finger in to take off the polish, there are 3 slits inside with a sponge that is soft, it also has a wand, at the end of it is just a ball of kinda like a little cotton ball, so if your having a hard time getting your dark colored nail polish off, you just take the wand thing and it takes it right off, oh and great for taking off nail polish on your toes! :)"
4,I've used Cutex products in the past and ...,"I've used Cutex products in the past and have always been happy with them. So when I Test Drove this I was very familiar with the brand. My experience was very positive. With just a quick turn of my finger, old polish was gone. It left my nails feeling clean -- and without any mess to clean up. My only problem was that I inadvertently tipped the jar and some of the remover came out."
4,I really liked this product. It was easy ...,"I really liked this product. It was easy to use, quick, and less messy than using regular nail polish remover. I'd definitely recommend this product to others. It worked very well to remove two layers of polish. My only complaint is that it left a little polish residue embedded near the cuticle, but I was able to remove that with a tissue. Great product!!"
2,broken...,the string pulled out from the metal clipping on the first night we used it with our costume.
1,Unhappy with product,"My son was anxious to get this whistle to complete his train conductor's costume. However, once we opened it, it looked great, but the whistle made no sound at all. It is cheaply made and he was disappointed. You get what you pay for..."
5,Excellent work - excellent report,"Greg Little and colleagues finally did what the archeological professionals should have done years ago - they actually did a thorough and honest examination of the evidence for a really ancient sunken harbor off Bimini. Sealevels dated by carbon 14 at many islands in the Bahamas show that sea level at those locations was 13 to 16 feet lower about 3000 years ago, so it looks like the Phoenicians were in America long before Columbus. The DVD production itself is very professional."
4,Bimini Road is an Ancient Harbor,"This DVD is well done. It documents the errors by ""experts"" who dismiss the intelligent creation of the ""Bimini Road"". I am more informed since I purchased the DVD."
4,Thank You,"I appreciate all the time you have taken to give this movie a chance to have been a part of your life. It was an amazingly fun project we spent a lot of time bringing together. I just wanted to say Thank You, whether you found appreciation for it or not, for allowing hopefully, a little bit of my enjoyment into your hearts.Sincerely,Frank"
1,Ummm.....and why was this made?,"Well, I give props to anyone making a bigfoot movie for release. This video is probably a bunch of friends (non-actors) that pooled their money together and made it on the weekends. To be brief, the video is so not worth the price tag and I'm sure your time is more valuable. In a nutshell: bad acting, bad effects and poor storyline."
1,POOR!!!,Poor acting and unbelievable scenarios riddle this lame excuse for a bigfoot documentary. Save your money!!!
2,Scream of the Sasquatch,"Wasn't quite what I was expecting, I mean it was written well, I like that they had the guys out there in the the woods, but they never found any actual real evidence, they were mostly just trying to outdo each other for the noteriety, and one ended up getting himself killed for it. I figure of your are serious about trying to hunt this creature then you should know all safety measures available."
3,it was ok,"Interesting enough, but the author went on and on and on for about four pages after I thought each chapter was done."
1,Critique of Twins,"This is a fascinating study of many types of twins - the most interesting of which are identical twins who were separated at birth and reunited later in life! Being a Gemini, I have always been entranced by twins and this book is excellent in fulfilling that fascination. The author writes with skill, empathy and obvious love of and painstaking research of her subject! 4 Thumbs up!"
2,JT's a bore and that's the truth,"If this collection represents James Taylor's best, I'd hate to think what the rest of his discography must sound like. It isn't that he writes bad songs - some of them are quite engaging - only that he sings them so monotonously. JT's interminable drone makes him the most sonambulistic singer of all time. I'm amazed his career has lasted this long. I can't imagine where his appeal lies. The quality of his compositions grows progressively worse with the 70s decade. Early songs like ""Fire & Rain"" were at least original and interesting. By the time he got to ""Shower the People"", they became candy floss. Yuk !"
3,18 Songs from Singer Songwriter James Taylor.,"Among the singer songwriters to emerge in the early 1970s was James Taylor, he shared the type of arena of, among others, Cat Stevens, Jackson Browne and Carole King.Introspective songs abound and more often than not, are sung in a sombre tone.The guitar is understated and the backing low keySome of the songs here are classics including Fire And Rain, You've Got A Friend and How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You).Covers of Everyday and Up On The Roof are comparatively smooth and not really to my taste.Leaving the best to last, I enjoy Carolina In My Mind and Handyman, the latter in particular is welcome for it's more postive outlook."
1,Don't let the name fool you,"The fan itself looks nice, but the size didn't cover the size it claims to be, then we got it installed the light bulb was broken and the wiring for the lighting was faulty, the fan works, but that's it. I have emailed the company twice & gotten no reply either."
4,Fine,These gloves were fine - particularly considering the cost - they are a great driving glove or just for running errands
4,Nice gloves,"I only paid $2.69, so I did not expect much. I was very surprised when they arrived. They were much nicer than I expected, and were very warm."
3,"Prefer more information, less filler","The film claims to be ""All that you want to know about the Sacred Word of God.""Personally, I would have preferred to learn still more about this mantra, rather than so many scenes of religious rites, etc., where little information is conveyed.For an instance among many, one particular scene obviously shows the guru explaining to two disciples exactly how a mala, or Hindu rosary, is used; but we can't hear what he is saying.Also, the Om symbol is apparently complex and made up parts which themselves are symbolic of the four states of consciousness, but this breakdown is never shown or explained, although the four states of consciousness are referred to elsewhere in the film.For a work of great depth and breadth which includes, among much else, materials on the Om mantra, I recommend Russill Paul's book, ""The Yoga of Sound."""
3,Nice sounds,The sounds produced by boyzone are fun to listen to and this collection is a nice one. Many good selections.
3,A Interesting Rom-Com,"As usual with Priyadarshan style, along with main plot (""Summer in Bethlehem"" story) this movie has subplots or similar scenes from few of his old movies like scenes from Kilukkam, Cheppu, dialogues similar to his old comedy movies (like ""Kailash Abdullah"").But The Acting is brilliant as everryone has played their role to perfection.Its a Really Good Tamil film and a jewel in Tamil cinema."
2,Insulting.,"So now not only do we women have a plethora of how-to books geared for us ""needy women"", but we now have a book to tell us specifically how to get a Black man, as if they have different needs/specifications from other men? Men are men, regardless of skin color. This was nothing more than a clever marketing ploy to attract the black female buyer in droves. And some of the tips were insulting. ""Smile alot to let him know you like him."" ??!! I'm not a friggin Barbie doll, thank you very much.And I'm always suspect of pseudo-feminist black women writers who hyphenate their names anyway."
4,Flute Music of the 16th and 17th Centuries,"The CD recording is wonderful. However, the condition of the used item I purchased left quite a bit to be desired. There were fingerprints on the CD, and the liner notes were all stuck together, perhaps from water damage. I tried to steam them to gently open the pages, but was only partially successful."
2,Really Bad Surf DVD,I recieved this DVD for free when I purchased some other and better surf DVDs through a seperate online source. It is really poor grainy surf film basically showing northern california surfers. While it does show some good sessions definitly not worth the price. If your looking for a good surf films stick with Taylor Steele's surf series like campaign or older momentum stuff.
5,Ant-Man Flashback,"This is a perfect collection for the Marvel collector or even just someone who wants to rekindle the old childhood memories of reading comic books. Ant-Man is my favorite super hero in the Marvel universe, learn how he becomes Ant-Man and then into Giant-Man(two completly different angles eh?). The issues go right up before his Avengers adventures. Theres about 30 comics in total wich is a bargin at this price."
3,it's a mystery,"when i heard my favourite female singer had paired with talk talk's paul webb aka mate rustin, mixed by the ole hipster who juggled together the glorious 'spirit of eden', i thought what more to ask for. anyone who's seen beth live will agree this woman shines oh so bright, and paul webb is a true craftsman, but sadly 'out of season' is more than disappointing to my subjective ears. not that i rushed to hear another portishead release, but with beth and 'spirit of eden' in my mind, i expected nothing less than a 21st century soul milestone. why it can't continue as beautifully as the first track, is a 'mystery' to me. it coulda bin a contender.............."
4,In my top ten of 2002- a hard feat to accomplish,"This is definitely an album to buy whether you're a Portishead fan or not. Portishead fans may be disappointed by the lack of beats which more or less (besides Gibbons' eerie vocals) made Portishead what it was. Those distracted by the beats, bells, and whistles, will be instantly attracted to this record. Being a Portishead fan, I was mighty cynical about this recording. Not being sure how a musically sparse sound would compliment Beth's voice, but she does a great job of wrapping her vocals around the sparse textures of the instruments. And the backing vocals are amazing. Buy this record just for the backing and lead vocal balance. It'll blow your mind with each listen."
3,Between Earth and Heaven,"Nice stuffs played by Mr. Howard's usual manner: very charming sound and virtuosity, sometimes hurried slow (IMPORTANT) sections. Above all, GREAT DEAL to face ALL Piano Music by Liszt, where each note says something! Not to talk about easiness of Howard's playing! Unbelievable!3 funeral odes are really great ""new"" works."
2,Very dated,"I read this many years ago when it came out. ""Mind blowing"" I think I would have said at the time. It is hard for me to tell whether the drug culture has become less (ir?) relevant, or if I have just gotten old and it seems far away and somehow sad. In any case the book is a collection of quirky pieces about drugs and wacky antics while on drugs. A must read for anyone interested in being reminded, in a somewhat unpleasant way, of what they were like in the 60's."
5,beautiful photos,"This book is wonderful with lots of beautiful photographs. There are colors that I never thought of using in my home, but this book has shown me that I can be adventurous and have splashes of pink or orange or brown, but still have a room look classic and elegant."
4,Southern Accents on Color - Frances MacDougall,"Nicely arranged as a resource for color. Fantastic ideas for windows and bedding. I'm taking it to my seamtress - This is exactly what I've wanted! Can you please do this? Also interesting to see the broad spectrum of ""neutral"" colors. Perfect as a housewarming gift."
2,Disappointing.,"I loved this magazine and have kept many back issues for reference in my design library.This book, however, fails to live up to the Southern Accents name. I'm glad I bought it used because it is destined for the rummage."
4,Inspiring!,Frances MacDougall and the Southern Accents editors have presented a book filled with beautiful photos and brilliant ideas! This book is extremely well done--from the author's interesting commentary and history of different colors to the actual examples of the way prominent interior designers use the various color schemes...I truly am inspired! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in interior design.
2,Not what I expected,"I have read and loved the books in Mrs. Gunn's ""Glenbrooke"" series, and I was hoping to find illustrations of the homes and gardens in fictional Glenbrooke, Oregon. I was seeking the recipes mentioned, but not provided, in the Glenbrooke books. I thought that the characters would be mentioned, or that their relationships might be elaborated upon...I was sadly disappointed. This is a lovely gift book, filled with brief, warm reflections on the author's own special moments revolving around the tea ritual. The illustrations are colorful and peaceful. The recipes look well-devised and tempting, though, I must admit, I have not tried any. This is a delightful book for people interested in ""taking tea"" with the author. But, I am sad to say, the relationship this book has to the Glenbrooke series is tangential at best."
1,Wrong Item,"I think that they forgot to update the picture on this page. I was excited to get this ark after reading negative reviews about the Touch & Feel version that said that the parts would detach and become chokables. Much to my dismay, the Touch & Feel showed up at my door both times I tried to order this one."
2,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!,I can not believe that they are getting away with scamming people this hard. This toy should retail for around $30 NOT $75! This is such a rip off. Keep searching this is not a deal! It's not a huge toy or anything. Get the exact same thing some where else!
2,Where is Mama Noah?,"I love Fisher Price and wanted my 18 month old to have a Noah's Ark to play with. I have two problems with this product. As I recall from my Bible, the point of the ark was two of each kind of animal. That would mean that Noah needs a wife. The old sets had a Mama Noah (as my 18 month old calls her) but the new ones don't. Also, the fuzzy animals are impossible to clean. I bought this ark only because the one with Mama Noah, and without the cloth animal parts, wasn't available anywhere. Then, I purchased the original Noah couple and animals separately from a private seller and that is what we use with the ark. I wish they hadn't changed the original set."
3,Didn't receive the same item (but 1-yr old still loves it),"I added this item to my daughter's Amazon wish list (~10/07) for her first birthday and was very excited when I saw it had been purchased by Grandma and Grandpa. However, I was somewhat disappointed when we received the package and found that it was the Touch and Feel version - not the one shown here. I had specifically chosen this all-plastic version based on the comments about easier cleanup of the animals. But we went ahead and kept it since my daughter was so excited to get her hands on it but am disappointed that we did not receive the item described. I will say that my daughter loves playing with this and her current obsession is to open and close the door of the ark, putting the animals in and taking them out. I would have given it a higher rating if it had been the proper item though. Amazon needs to update the listing if the ""old"" plastic version is really no longer available."
5,Foolproof,"Having tried many times many times to add a towing connector on my vast array of ancient cars, once I tried a seven pin, never again, I was extremely skeptical about adding a four pin flat towing connector to my 2006 Subaru Tribeca.How wrong I was. IT WAS A BREEZE. The hardest thing was removing the small black plastic Phillips head screws from the storage tray which sat over the spare tire. If you are a non mechanical type do not let this worry you.An excellent product and so easy to add to your car."
5,have not read this book- but the following is a comment,"I have not read this book yet, but decided to comment on one I have read. For a non-bias account of the Gestapo and their TRUE leader (a brilliant man who worked for the US later), read ""Heinrich Muller: Gestapo Chief"". This book will open your eyes."
5,The Gestapo: Nazi Germany's Instrument of Terror,"Perhaps no single word conjures up such images of oppression and horror as 'Gestapo.' Rupert Butler's penetrating account of this organization tells exactly why that is. In addition to the history and evolution of the Gehime Staats Polizi, this book also covers the methods of terror the Gestapo used in carrying out it's policies of destruction and murder. Also included is a breakdown of the various departments and divisions within the organization. But perhaps most illuminating is the inclusion of several stories by those who came face to face with the dreaded secret police- from a leader in the Polish underground to an unexpected, and almost comical, meeting with Reinhard Heydrich, these stories fill in the gaps of human emotion that most historians often fail to convey. If you are interested in just how the Nazi's were able to silence their political opponents with the terror that came to be their trademark, Butler's book is must reading."
5,Excellent book with loads of researched information,"As with any book, I was weary at first on how the information was verified, but when I got to the end, I felt as if I took for granted what an expert Butler proved to be in this field. This book is an absolute MUST for people interested in this topic."
3,Intriguing history of Nazi Germany's Secret Police...,"The author tracks the political machinations of the SS, the Gestapo, and evolution of Hitler's instruments of terror. He chronicles it from its beginnings as a small intelligence agency watching communist dissendents to its evolution into a monsterous secret police and intelligence agency. He offers insights on the minds of Hitler, Goering, Himmler, Schellenberg, and other movers and shakers in the Third Reich.The only downside is this book is not a thorough piece of scholarship... Not everything is footnoted or substantiated. The bibliography is skimppy. Moreover, the author didn't go to any great lengths to find multiple sources or add any new revelations. Albeit, he did feature interviews from the Gestapo's living victims."
5,"Atmospheric, minimal techno from Iceland.","This album is a collection of songs labelled snowflake(s) one thru ten. Each song explores a different facet of the same sonic landscape, where gentle washes of white noise and nearly subliminal sounds of water and melting snow provide dramatic backdrop for soft melodies and gentle techno. The sound is lush and liquid while remaining quite minimal, like most Force Inc. and Force Tracks releases. Yagya takes a very ""Berlin"" techno aesthetic and mixes it with his naturalistic approach to soundscaping, coming up with a satisfying and fresh style all his own. This album seems to make graceful techno minimalism sound as natural as the sound of melting snow. An essential listen."
5,Yagya '- Rhythm Of Snow,"Yagya made a big splash -- if one can splash in sub-arctic temperatures -- with RHYTHM OF SNOW. The album wears its dub techno influences proudly: ""Snowflake 1"" is all about the background crackle and the long, sustained chords. And while the individual tracks don't differ greatly from one another, the cumulative effect of the album is akin to being snowed in; the deep, resonant tones, the beats fluttering by like drifts, the build-up of ice. ""Snowflake 4"" starts to sparkle a little more, and ""Snowflake 5"" almost sounds perky by comparison. The beat of ""Snowflake 8"" seems to emanate from the heart of a melting glacier, and by ""Snowflake 9,"" the beat has broken off and disappeared into the Arctic Ocean. The slow float of ""Snowflake 6,"" though, stands out in particular for its lovely, lush chord progression, which is reprised in ""Snowflake 10,"" though the melody is more filtered. A lovely album that stands up to the hype."
2,snowflakes but i am disappointed,I own this cd. When i bought it i expected a lot from it: especially because of the coverdesign: snow white soft and smooth atmospheres. But right from the first listen i realized that the constant presence of a 4/4 kick was unbearable for me.To be sincere i would save only track 6 which is a beautiful and moving melody - the rest is very disappointing and falls short of my expectations.If you have any feedback i would be happy to share thoughts--------------- carlogiova@yahoo.it ----------------
1,"As someone else said, ""slow and boring.""","We just saw this on TV, fortunately. We like Chabrol's films - the ones we have seen - butthis film took two evenings to get through. Not much of a story, and done sluggishly - sorry to say.Try to rent it, if you are a Chabrol fan."
2,A bit slow and boring,"The female judge is played as the all-knowing eye, and the corrupt men she prosecutes are portrayed as dummies, venal with power and the misplaced belief that they can outfox the woman. Based on a real French scandal, this movie probably plays better to French audiences who can appreciate the reality upon which it's based. To Americans, it's all a bit sluggish and not fleshed out enough."
5,The most beautiful music--and not just for Christmas!,If you like Medieval and Renaissance music you will absolutely love this CD. I bought it as a Christmas CD years ago and I listen to it year around. The harmonies are beautiful. I have given it to friends for presents. I have CDs of music from this time period but this is my favorite. I very highly recommend it.
5,Splendid,It was sent directly to a musician who enjoys all sorts of music and who has a collection of renaissance music. Splendid is his description.
1,the worst,"overall everything about this products is weak doesn't spray straight or evenly, you get more on your fingers than you do on your project"
1,Avoid this,"It does not seat perfectly in the Nikon charger and hence, 4 hours later the charger is still blinking furiously indicating the battery remains totally discharged. If you examine this battery carefully next to a real Nikon battery you should be able to tell that it is ever so slightly larger. If you try putting it into your camera, good luck getting it out. I just don't know how these people get away with calling this a ""replacement"" for the EN-EL7. It's a cheesy knockoff that doesn't work."
4,A nice overview of the carpet industry,"from chennile to the modern day corporate titans of tufting. Especially good if you are from the South and have felt the impact of the carpet industries. With a detailed look at many of the industries leading personalities, this book is a must for those who are involved in carpet manufacturing and interested in its history."
4,Fun way to prepare,"One of the more readable preparation guides for this exam. It misses a few topics that showed up on the exam, but I used this book along with some practice exams and passed the first time."
2,Nothing New,"This book could've been written by anybody with access to a library. There is nothing new, revealing, insightful, or hip. This book is a rehash of stuff and I'd feel it was a waste except for some pics of Bud I've never seen.This great piano player deserves better"
2,Don't use with glass bottles,"I concur with the other reviews that state that this is pretty lousy for use with the glass bottles. They flop over and refuse to stand upright. The posts that the bottles rest on are just too short. And on top of that the grate that the post are a part of is made of pretty flimsy plastic, and if you don't balance the distribution of your bottles the grate will warp, making it even more difficult to keep the bottles upright. I'm not going to replace it since I've had it for a year now and just suffered through until we switch fully to sippys. I suppose it's not terrible for sippy cups, but I had assumed, incorrectly, when I bought it that it had some special design that made it perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles. But nope, this is pretty lame."
3,Working not so great second rack,"It's good and working for me, but the bottom rack is almost useless and hard to reach under it. In my perspective this design will not work even if you raise the height of the bottom one, because still you have to reach under it. Like other reviewers said, i should have considered some spining design."
3,Never use the bottom rack,"The bottles could use a more stable surface to dry on, and I have never needed to use the bottom rack. An ok product, but could use better stability."
3,demasiado grande,"si tienes un bebe solamente es como muy grande, porque casi nunca tienes lavando 8 teteros al mismo tiempo! al final decidimos quedarnos con una sola bandeja y guardar la otra para en una oportunidad posterior darsela como regalo a alguien!"
3,Pretty good for a bottle drying rack!,"I read many reviews before I purchased this. I would have to say I agree, it's ok! It's better as 2 pieces b/c you can fit more bottles."
5,A Must-Have!,"This keeps everything so organized and all together, right where you need it! Love this!"
4,Not my favorite,This thing is a little awkward with its two tiers. You pretty much have to take off the top tier to reach whatever is in the bottom tier. It does offer a good deal of space though. You can set it up 2 different ways. One way drains the water so you can put it directly next to a sink and never worry about dealing with the drainage. The second way collects the water so you can leave this rack on the counter and just dump out the water. I ended up returning it for something slightly smaller. I'm regretting that decision now.
4,We used this all the time,It's kind of a pain to use it stacked; we ended up laying out both racks side by side on top of the microwave. We used this every day.
2,"Great bottles, mediocre drying rack","I've been more than happy with Dr. Brown's bottles, dishwasher containers, and formula mixing pitchers... but this drying rack is a disappointment. It is sturdy enough to hold the plastic bottles well, but it is nearly impossible to reach items on the bottom rack. It really isn't worth the counter space it consumes. I would recommend buying a single-tiered or rotating rack."
1,wouldn't buy again,I don't see the purpose I put the bottles on the counter after sterilazion waste of money.
2,"Bottles good, Rack Bad",I use the First Years Modular Drying Rack with my Dr. Brown's bottles. It is a much better design and IT SPINS! Dr. Brown's version has a hard to reach bottom rack which I would hate to be fishing bottle parts out of at 2 a.m!
1,Disappointing,"If I had paid 2 dollars for this, I wouldn't bother to complain.As reviewed by others, it is indeed correct that it's poorly designed : too flimsy for Dr Brown's own 8oz glass bottles!! The bottles on the picture must be a light plastic model (if it's not a computer-generated rendition), be warned: you won't be able to do that with glass bottles.And the bottom section of the rack? impossible to reach anything underneath.A cheaper substitute: your regular dish rack."
3,Just Ok,"I received this item as a baby shower gift. I like that this system has the stacking feature and is big enough to hold all the Dr. Brown's parts. My complaint with this drying rack is it seems to take the bottles forever to dry. After sterilizing the bottles in the Dr. Brown's microwave sterilizer, I put bottles on the rack to dry, and it took a good 24+ hours for all the bottles to be completely dry. I have another drying rack that holds the bottles at an angle, and it dries bottles and parts faster. It seems like if moisture is going to sit in the bottles for that long after sterilizing them, they wouldn't be as sterile. In the future I plan on using the dishwasher most of the time since it actually dries everything quickly."
2,Grass mat products or regular drying rack better,"As other reviews have said, this won't hold glass bottles at all, it is not great with 8 oz. plastic bottles, the bottom shelf is very difficult to reach (you have to unstack it to load/unload, which makes all the stuff on the top fall), and it has very little airflow, so things stay wet.Dr. Brown's just wanted to make a little more $ so they put their name on a product that is not all that great."
2,The Life and Times of Accounting Information Systems,This book reminds me more of a travelog about many of the sights and sounds you will encounter on your quest to become best friends with your Accounting Information System.It would make a lot more sense if the authors skipped a lot of the details of where Accounting Information Systems fit in our social experience and get down to dealing with the dirty details of how someone would go about writing a system of their own.Then they could spend a chapter on how to go about the testing of the system and how and why to do a complete re-write of this masterpiece.
1,Bad VCR,"I have had this TV for 7 months, and the VCR has destroyed at least 10 vcr tapes. The tape gets stuck inside while the cassette ejects. I contacted Mganavox and they were no help- watsted an hour of my day talking to them. Otherwise, the TV/DVD has been OK."
1,Jill's losing it,"I bought the cd because I really enjoyed the first two so much.I laughed once in the third cd. This book is a rehash of many stories from the first three, with a bit of new stuff thrown in.Don't waste your money."
4,"The ""Queens"" make everything fun!","The Sweet Potato Queens find humor in everything, and it is infectious. It's hard to stop reading Jill Connor Browne, she's so darn funny."
1,Not so great,"Being a huge fan of Conne Browne, I looked forward to this book- hoping it was better than the last 2. What a disappointment. It seemed the author had set up her own message board and drew tales from other 'queens' to fill this book up.It's ok for the occasional chuckle, but it seems her run has come to an end."
3,Sweet Potato Queens Wedding Planner -----,"Funny book BUT a lot of the profanity and ""four letter words"" were totally unnecessary. The book would be better without them...."
1,Less than satisfied!,"After hearing Jill Conner Browne in a radio interview, I couldn't wait to get this book to read. I have a young friend soon to be engaged, so I ordered a copy for her as well. At first, the book was very humerous. However, I was very disappointed about half-way through the Wedding Planner when the book became very nasty. There's no way that I would feel comfortable giving this book to my young friend - therefore, I returned the copies for a refund. I'm really not a prude - just selective in what I read or watch."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,This is a laugh out loud book. Once again Jill C. Brown has hit the nail on the head. Her books kept me laughing when crying would have made more sense. Down to earth Funny and some very touching stories from friends. You must read this.
4,LOVE IT!,"I love Ms. Browne's books, this one is no exception. Such a clever premise, and between all the hilarity, some gems of wisdom. Ms. Browne's books are like a portable party. (Not a portable potty, a portable PARTY.) Brava!"
3,Count Basie in-concert,"The first track on GOLD COLLECTION * COUNT BASIE is a radio transcription. It opens with shrill crowd noise that briefly obscures the kickoff of ""One O'Clock Jump."" After a few bars, the audience is jarringly shunted to the background either by poor editing or spastic audio mixing. ""Lullabye of Birdland,"" more radio broadcast stuff, has the fidelity of a sound check, barely. Worse, someone has apparently set up the lone microphone too close to an overused cymbal.The rest of the tracks have much better fidelity. The performances are solid and all are in-concert; many have inaudible stage chatter after the applause dies. (The band member intros following ""Nails"" would have been a lot better if done on-mike, BTW.)Criticisms aside, this GOLD COLLECTION set is a decent example of the latter-day Count Basie band in concert.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 55:30"
4,Missing ...,"Well it's easy to forget what a band was famous for when its biggest hit hinges on a remixed track that wasnt gonna be a hit in its original form. Prior to Missing, EBTG has been towing hard in the '80s with its own brand of acoustic / alternatice rock that had garnered them a circle of fans. One of their 780's hit, a re-recording of Rod Stewart's I Don't Wanna Talk About It is missing here for good reason. Their own songs are much better.It's more exciting cos by the 90's Tracy THorn and Ben Watt have emerged as one of the most revered trip hop/dance artists in the music scene. Their Amplified Heart album sports their biggest hit Missing but the real winners here are Tracy Thorn's collaboraton with Massive Attack on Protectuion and the songs that came from their Walking Wounded (1996) and Tempermental (1999). For a rather complete history of the band, this is the disc and Rhino Records sweetens the deal witha 4-disc bonus CD unavailable elsewhere!"
4,Pain,"The title track is still the most well composed track on the CD. The lyrics are deep and painful for those who can relate. Automatically, it takes the listener back to younger days for those of us who are older, or to relationships that were once good and since dissolved, with an emphasis and focus on time gone by and lost forever. While the music is more dance mix, the lyrics are beautiful and the track should be recognized for that first and foremost."
3,Why mess with success?,"While I think that it's great that the band picked out what they thought were their best tunes, why did they alter them? Some of the changes are subtle, and some are overt, but all of the changes take away from the originals charm. I wanted what I had heard before, not what you wanted to record differently the second time around. If they had been released in this version, they would not have been hits. I'm still a fan, but remember that it's not cool to fool us."
2,Everything And A Hit,"This is a greatest hits compilation from Britain's chill out band, who only received world-renowned success with their one big hit ""Missing."" But other than the band's fast metamorphosis from straight-forward songs to dance gurus, there is little to be appreciated. In fact, their most striking work is only delicious after being reconstructed by a mastermind remixer or is a collaboration.""Missing"" becomes a hit only after Todd Terry recreates it into a dancefloor-wise tune and the Photek remix does ""Single"" wonders.The other songs lag and you'll find yourself skipping a lot until you get to the half-hit ""Walking Wounded.""""Protection"" is the strongest number on the collection, but then again it was created by trip-hop gods Massive Attack with the Everything But The Girl's lead merely guesting."
1,STOP THE REMIXES!,"I bought this CD because of the title track - then I play the CD and the track is a remix, completely different that what is played on the radio. I despise remixes, so I was quite disappointed."
4,"Really, really great","It's been a great product for me, as I do quite a bit of entertaining. It holds heat however for only one hour (after you unplug it), so if you plan to keep things fairly warm, you have to keep it plugged in. But for my needs, even the portable ones. it works. I'm very pleased."
3,No one had that good of a time on the trail into the unknown,"Come on, this girl was definitely taught to never say anything negative. It could not have been one big adventure. It had to heartbreaking to leave home, uncomfortable at the very least."
5,The Herbal Medicine Bible!,"As a naturopathic physician, this book has not left my side since the 4 years I was in school, or this last year I've been in practice. It's also a great book for people who want to start making their own medicine, as it gives recipes for salves, tinctures, poultices and the like. Sharon Tilgner's company, Wise Woman Herbals, is one of the most prescribed brands of herbal medicine in my profession, so why not learn from the best?"
3,Stephanie McMahon,This item I was pleased with. Her arms are still attached. My grand child plays with her all the time.
4,More great Allan Sherman!,"Great songs that I remember from my childhood! (Even my teenagers enjoy of the humor, despite the fact that some of it is a bit oudated.)"
1,check the depth of the water before you dive,"I found that this book doesn't have a lot of depth, just happy joy joy rippling the waves. Check the depth before you dive into this one, you might land on your head. Think I'll grab the huka and space right out."
4,Excellent wall mounts,Easy to install. Many different configurations and angles possible. Fit my speakers perfectly.
3,200mm crystal ball defective,"Well, I bought one of these hoping to learn a bit, but when I started putting it to work, I didn't see anything. I kept looking and looking. I cleared my mind and focused very deeply into the ball.... but nothing.. I think this one is defective or something as I can't even see into tomorrow let alone next week or beyond.If you're looking for answers, this isn't your ball."
3,Average Classic Inspector Gadget episode,From the back of the box:What's pink and little and has big teeth ready to devour Inspector Gadget? A Linguini. And devious Dr. Claw has sent five hungry Linguinis to gobble Gadget up in his most fiendish and -- dare we say it? -- most pre-pasta-rous plot!Running time: Approx. 22 minutes.
2,Science & Religion - Haught,This is an excellent book for anyone struggling to come to terms with the complexity of the subject matter giving the student an in depth appraisal in the most readable manner. Highly recommended.
2,If You're an Idiot,"I had to read this book for my Science and Religion class in college, and it was so redundant. The author says the same exact thing over and over. using various different kind of metaphors. I mean, I guess if you don't understand what he's trying to say, it helps that he's going over it over and over, so you can understand. But the material is pretty straightforward.This book could probably be 1/3 of the length.Maybe it's good for a person who's severely disinterested in the subject of Science and Religion, since it explains EVERYTHING. MULTIPLE TIMES."
4,Ancient Christianity Provides Help In Modern Times,"This little book gives us a glimpse into what life was like for those living in the beginnings of the Church era and has much to say to those who seek a spiritual path relevant to today. Early followers of Christ were not looking for a quick fix to their lives, nor were they trying to find simple answers. This book shows the depth and richness of the Christian life when lived in it's fullness and is a recommended read for anyone looking to understand this ancient way of transformation."
4,Great call to walking the path of Jesus,"This is a wonderful book! It reminds us modern, Western Christians that we focus too much on ""debt paid"" theology. There is so much more to following Jesus Christ than simply being forgiven. You can live in Him and be transformed into His likeness. The book may be hard for those not at least familiar with some elements of Eastern Orthodoxy and at times implies at a certain superiority of Orthodoxy. However, the author's true purpose and heart are to present the wonderful and COMPLETE message of Christ in our time."
5,amazing,"you can't be a good cook without a good knife. this is a GREAT knife. chroma is one of those things great cooks keep secret. there is no better brand for cooks with gourmet aspirations. i'd say it's the cadillac of knives, but its more like the bentley silvercloud."
3,Rusts Easily,"I agree with the other reviews, it handles great and is very comfortable to hold. It's got a great 'feel' and weight to it. I bought this knife from Amazon in December 2009. The only problem is that is rusts very easily even after the first few uses. I've tried to be very careful wiping it dry after washing. Product description also states that you need a special type 301 whetstone to sharpen this knife."
4,Can I buy this book?,"I'm a Korean. There is not the book in Korea.So a question that ""Can I get this book?"" ishappened.ASAP, I want to receive your answer on my question.Sincerely yours."
2,size chart,"I have to return this item, because size chart is way out of right scale. If anyone wants these shoes, get 1 size bigger, you usually wear, at least. And shoes are very very narrow. If you got lucky and it fits you, these shoes must be comfortable, they have soft cushion-like inside lining."
4,Cold Air Intake K&N for 2004 Ford 6.0,Took about 2 hours to install and works very nice. Have had on my truck for about 1.5 to 2 years. A+ item and have always used K&N products and have never had a problem with them.
1,cute but definitely unreliable,"It was our second kids timex watch that broke within the first year. Yes, there is a warranty, but it costs as much as the watch cost to get it repaired that way. The third watch is still working after one year though. If you want a cute watch that looks like a grown up watch this fits the bill. My daughter was heartbroken when it quit working after six months."
4,As Advertised,"This was a perfect choice for a child who is not an adult, but needs a grown up looking watch and who needs to learn how to tell time as analog and not digital. Very pleased with choice."
5,Christopher Howard,"Product arrived new as stated, and the date the product arrived was exactly what the company told me it would. Very pleased with my purchase from Amazon."
5,I'm not a kid and it's far from being my first Timex....,"....but I love my lavendar watch! For a great price, it fits the average adult easily, is water resistant to 30 meters, and has the Indiglo feature. I couldn't ask for anything more!"
5,Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler,"This is a touching and wonderful true story. The first time I saw it on TV I had to have the DVD. It is amazing what Sendler did to save so many children during WWII, yet few have heard this story. Sendler touched so many lives. She died only a couple of years ago at the age of 98. The story of what she did was only discovered a few years before she died by some students in a Kansas school. Everything about Sendler's life is absolutely amazing."
5,Hallmark Always Does a Great Job!,"I enjoyed this movie and shared it with my students. The Holocaust has thousands of stories out there that are educational, but not all are o.k. for pre-teens to see.This one was well done and educational as well as enlightening.Irena was a super hero by any generation's standards."
5,Wonderful video - fantastic woman,"Our book club was reading Life in a Jar by Jack Mayer, the Irena Sendler story, it correlates with this video.Everyone seems to know Schindler's list - he helped 1000 Jewish people escape to freedom. This remarkable woman helped 2500 children escape. If you ask her she would say it was her ""network"" and it probably was but she was the mastermind and the motivator.Her accomplishments were practically unnoticed until some students of Mr Conaard's in Kansas wrote a play based on her life . They traveled to meet her and still do the play when they can.It is such a story of the human spirit and the hatred of other ""humans"".We are blessed to have had this woman's contributions.You will have a hard time putting this book down.Be sure to check out the Irena Sendler Website"
2,WOW!!!,"Great Great Record. It's the cutest,coolest cd i've heard all year.What a GREAT voice.Such a cool drink of water compared to a lot of junk on the radio these days."
5,Great for getting started with web application development,"While I have not yet finished reading this book, I cansay that thus far, it appears to be well written.Interestingly enough, I have the first book writtenby this couple nearly 20 years ago, which was alsoa very well written book.Bottom line, this is a useful companion to someonelooking to create web applications with Java StudioCreator.In addition to this book, I purchased the ""Core JSF"" bookat the same time. The differences are quite stark.If like me, you are also looking for more in depth knowledgeof the technology behind Studio Creator (such as Java ServerFaces), then I would recommend either the JSF specificationitself (from java dot sun dot com) or a book OTHER thanthe Core JSF book by Geary and Horstmann).For roughly one hundred fifty dollars, a developer canpurhase this book, and Sun's Java Studio Creator. Coupledwith these tools, web developers with moderate knowledgecan begin creating web applications, simply and quickly."
3,A work in progress...,I will amplify the author's honest comment that this book is a work in progress. I'm looking forward to the revised edition that will match the current version of the Creator IDE.
2,Studio Creator,"Although it was helpful getting started it did not address using feature beyond the basics. Although Sun touts Creator as an easy to use tool, like most of Java it is unecessarily complex. The book just gives an introduction but not much beyond that."
5,Another account of the Double helix discovery,"This book is another biographical work related to the history of molecular biology and the role of physics in its development. While the introductory chapters deal with Wilkins's early life and career, the part that was in particular interesting for me was his work on DNA structure, his relationship and interaction with Franklin, Crick and Watson. Wilkins wrote that onw of the main reasons to write the book is to give his account of the events, and in particular, to remove the ""stigma"" that he was the one who was responsible for Franklin being left out from the Big Trio of Double Helix (himself, Crick & Watson). The book is a must for those interested in the history of molecular biology and the events that led to the discovery of double helix."
3,Enjoyable read,"I enjoyed this book's approach; the authors and channel chose to bypass known information about the stones in order to avoid biases and bring forth new information. While all channeled information should be taken with a grain of salt, this book still taps into some great resources. I enjoy that the book does describe the energetic imprints of the seven crystal systems, albeit briefly."
5,The Spirtual Value of Gem stones,"I actually had this book once before and gave it to a friend, but I enjoyed it so much I bought it again."
3,Beautiful images but lacking in content,"I love Nikki McClure's artwork and nearly bought multiple copies of this book at once to distribute among ""expecting"" friends. But I'm glad I purchased just one copy (for my nephew's first birthday), as I don't think I'll be buying more. Per the norm, the pictures are beautiful and touching, but I'm actually worried this will confuse my young nephew as he learns the alphabet. The concept of stopping at ""n"" to nap is cute, but not exactly a lesson in toddler academics. Not to mention, many of the alpha-words aren't going to mean much to a small child. In short: I suspect this is more for artistically-minded mothers than for their children. Also, I was a bit surprised by the small size. The dimensions are mentioned here (6in x 6in) but I wasn't quite prepared for how little that was. But I suppose that's typical of board books..."
5,Beautiful Book,A huge fan! Happy to see childrens books. They are thoughtful and so beautiful. The first time I read it I was so dissapointed it ended at N.I wanted to see more pictures... a sequel perhaps!?
4,great mat! But will it last?,My dog absolutely LOVES this mat - spends a lot of time on it. She's a ten year old lab with arthritis and who recently had ACL surgery. She's on two types of painkillers Rimadyl and Tramadol but still shows discomfort after walking and in hear. I really expected her to ignore this mat as she has other beds I've tried for her but she goes on it independently for several hours at a time. Not sure how long it will last since it warns you to be careful of the edges but she'll enjoy it while it does. I do wish that it were easier to take along with you as you travel because I think it would be great for her in the motor home for the summer...
5,OMG! IT WORKS!,"I'm an african-american women who purchased this oil a little over seven weeks ago. I did my research and knew that products which contained rosemary, sage, nettle or black seed help with hair growth. This oil has all of these ingredients and more in one solution. I use it 1x/wk as an overnight pre-poo scalp massage treatment(5 mins then cover hair with a plastic cap to create a sauna-like atmosphere) prior to deep condition days. If I hadn't witnessed it myself, I wouldn't believe it but, my hair has grown 2"" in six weeks! My hair in the back prior was mid-neck length. Now it's a tad past shoulder length. The areas behind my ears on either side in the back are collar bone length. My new goal now is to try to get all of my hair the same length. It may take me the next year to do but at least I know this stuff works. I'm going to buy another bottle or two to last me for the next six months! This oil is fantastic and I love the woodsy herbal scent!"
3,Fine for beginners,"Ok for starters. If you need more depth you better think of going somewhere else, however as a begginer or as a refresher it is fine!"
3,Book OK,Therapist recommended this book and it reads like a therapist recommended it. I have ADD and she thought it might help. It gives generic assistant for ANYONE who has trouble with meeting people and starting conversations. I don't have that problem; just have trouble editing my conversations BEFORE I start them. Have read the first couple of chapters and am not happy with it. Have yet to get to the social networking area so it may improve but I am not hopeful.
2,so so,"The book was somewhat informative, but it's not for someone that can already get by in a conversation. The contents of the book almost felt like something you would teach in an English as Second Language class."
1,only meant for teenagers,Not much in this book is something we are not already aware of.Don't buy if you are looking for something interestingly new.
3,Your first conversation book.,"This book is an example of how easy it is for people to get into deep conversation simply by being polite and saying hi. Don's advice probably won't help those who need a little more help chatting up a storm. This book does not deal with how to surmount communicational obstacles except for language differences. The book is geared towards the socially groomed person who just needs a tad push into social situations; when to smile and shake hands. This book makes a great starter for explaining the beginning mechanics of conversation, nothing too deep."
1,Too Vague,"I read this book at the local Barnes & Nobles. I thougt I was getting something out of it because the ideas the author was talking about sounds very interesting.I was greatly disappointed because throughout the entire book, I found no actual example of dialogues, NONE. It's like saying ""BE frindly at first every you meet a person"" and it does not tell you how to be friendly nor any example of conversation.Don't waste your money, I recommend this one instead:Conversationally Speaking : Tested New Ways to Increase Your Personal and Social Effectivenessby Alan GarnerThanks for reading"
4,"What to say after you say, ""Hi.""","This book is about how to carry on a conversation with someone--what to say after you say, ""Hello."" In fact, even how to say, ""Hello.""Although the author does not state that the purpose of the book is how to find a date, a lot of the illustrations are along these lines. But, the principles elaborated upon are useful for all types of relationships and circumstances.The book is a very fast and easy read. It is organized by topic with key points and sub-topics in large bold font. Accordingly, this makes it quick and easy to find the information that is of value to you. You can gloss over or skip those topics of less interest without concern of missing an important point.I would recommend this book to anyone who finds it difficult to start or maintain a conversation."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"I bought this book on the strength of several other reviews and its rating, but I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a book in my life. This should be titled, ""The Absolute Moron's Guide to Conversation"". There is nothing in here that anyone with the most rudimentary social skills doesn't already know.Wow, I didn't know that I shouldn't call people when they are in a movie theater, or that discussing death is poor social etiquette at a party. And what isn't obvious is patently ridiculous.I teach English conversation skills to non-native speakers and was hoping that I could find some tips that would help my students. Sadly, even my least skilled students would find this book far beneath them."
4,Great Primer,"This short volume is a great primer for those who are intimidated about talking to new people. It goes through body language, memory tips, and give lots of specific advice and phrases that can be used in many situations. As long as you stay away from the examples that sound like you're looking for a romantic relationship, the advice in this book can help you establish new relationships, and build your professional network."
1,"Dumb book, no new ideas in here","All common sense stuff like smile, be positive, give out sincere compliments show interest in what others are interested in, nothing new , I heard all these ideas before, waste of time and money."
3,Useful,"This is a useful book. If you are not good at making conversation, terrified of small talk, or have difficulty in keeping conversation flowing, this will help. If on the other hand you are good at conversation nonetheless a few nuggets of useful reminder appear--for example ""Reveal your goals--Reveal your goals and struggles. You'll be surprised to learn that most people empathize with you and will usually be encouraging. ....""The book has little that is unique about it, and is no substitute for another human being such as a boss, lover or parent showing you how to make decent conversation, but it does a workmanlike job of the task. Enough for me to throw out my paper copy and replace it with the Kindle version.""EPICTETUS"""
1,Inappropriate for teens.,"I bought this item in hopes it would be a similar topic like ""Grand Avenue"" and I had wanted to share this with my clients- adolescent teens in a treatment center. After I reviewed it, I want to return it! It was of poor quality, the acting is on a lower level and the topics are even lower. It is an inappropriate series that involves extensive drinking and doesn't even come close to reflecting an accurate view of an Indigenous population. If it were titled ""Coyote"", then it would have been more appropriate. It was just a dumb series."
1,Horrible,"I am not Native American. I saw Dance me Outside and loved it. I wanted to see this series when it was on in Canada but i live in the USA, I hate this series and now I am stuck with this DVD. Don't buy this."
2,only Ok,"I bought this book thinking if I peed my pants reading ""The Gallery of Regrettable Food"" I'd love this, but I didn't care for it and I love baby books of ALL kinds. Maybe you will enjoy more that me."
2,"Good Jokes, Short Read","This book is funny because of the writers comments mostly, although there are a few times where you will be wondering how our parents or grandparents survived. A lot of the time, I found myself ""standing up"" for the old-fashioned advice because honestly, a lot of it made sense when you think about the era. For example, they still teach us that newspaper can help with delivering a baby if there are not better materials available.It is worth a read if you have an hour to kill, but I probably would not purchase it again since reading it once is enough."
4,"Well honed snarkery, probably best for parents","Columnist and blogger James Lileks is making a third career out of dredging up ludicrous adverts and articles from times past and mercilessly ragging on them. Someday the copyright police will catch on to all the unattributed and unauthorized repurposing and slam Lileks in jail, but until then I'll keep buying them.In ""Mommy Knows Worst"" he takes on the dark past's hair-raising notions of scientific child care. There's a lot here, and I wish there was more. He could probably have done a whole second volume on educational fads and kiddie snack foods.In terms of editing and layout ""Mommy Knows Worst"" is the best of Lilek's snark volumes. In terms of laughs, it doesn't quite reach the brilliant heights of ""The Gallery of Regrettable Foods."" However, there is plenty here to like, and I imagine parents befuddled by today's parenting advice and marketing campaigns will find it especially funny.I've ordered a short stack of copies for Xmas gifts."
5,Thank goodness times have changed,"This book made me laugh so hard I cried. And then when I remembered that women were actually told these things, straight-faced, by people in their lives, I just wanted to cry. The diagrams of the delivery room setup and the equipment needed to prepare formula, as well as the constant reminders to boil everything, are funny on their own. But Lileks' comments are what makes this a must-have in my humor collection. Kudos."
2,Funnier without commentary,"Not exactly what I expected. I prefer to look at the vintage ads and excerpts and come to my own conclusions about why they're hilarious or outrageous. The author's commentary was barely ever funny to me. And there is a TON of author's commentary. I suppose all the historical documents are real, but something about the layout and colors used in the book made it feel fake to me, like it was designed to be a gag gift. All in all, a let-down of a book for me."
5,Fun Book,"I gave this book as a gift to a couple at a baby shower, with a note to not use any of the advise I was giving them. Got lots of laughs."
2,A big disappointment,"As a fan of Lileks' ""Regrettable Food"" volume, I bought this only to be greatly disappointed -- it's just not funny enough. Rather than let the vintage material speak for itself, the author feels compelled to make sarcastic comments which are not very clever or entertaining. Many of the reproductions of the vintage material are small and hard to read, and there simply aren't enough good ones to justify this as a full book. It would have been better for the author to have culled only the best and most outrageous of these items and used it as a chapter in some other book. Therefore, I simply cannot recommend this one."
4,Laugh out-loud funny,"I skimmed through this one in a bookstore, and found myself laughing uproariously at every other page.It wasn't as good as Gallery of Regrettable Food, but still worthwhile."
4,A fun read,"I love exploring James Lilek's website and this book is just more of his wackiness. A majority of the items were way before my time but I did note my not-so-beloved ""carseat"" in there. Nothing like being hooked to the front seat with some metal tubing and a thin plastic strap!"
1,waste of good money,"bought this to video snow skiing. cute and compact. too bad it is such a poor quality camera. video is terrible. won't load to my computer video software that comes with it. can watch on tv, thats it.with all the bad reviews i would hope samsung would offer a credit or something to replace it!!!!!!!!!"
2,Fun Cam - Hard to burn for CD-R's etc.,"The camera is a great FUN TOY ! I bought it to take on my vacation to Hawaii, but while playing with it at home, I realized that the only output is HighMat and it won't play on other non Computer technology thats not MighMat, which is a new operating system for DVDS Etc, that currently is not available almost anywhere. I called BOSE and their system, like Sonys is not compatable. So if its fun you want,,,this is great, but I will have to bring my Canon Z80 onvacation. It also is not compatable with Studio 8 or other movie programs. It comes with a very confusing editor system, and can be edited with Microsoft Movie Maker...but that also needs a codec from Samsun that can be downloaded from Samsungs website - otherwise good luck!"
2,Disappointed,It is a neat little gagit but it doesn't seem to work so well when I'm mountain biking with it. It tends to shut down by itself. The software that comes with it isn't all that useful either and the format is not universally supported by Mac or PC.
1,Samsung SCX105L MPEG4 Sports Camcorder,"This product now lies dead in my office. I don't have the heart to actually through it out, which I will eventually have to do. Yes, through it away...as in, put it in the garbage, all $700 of it.The sound system in the camera has an intolerable intermittent crackling sound, very loud. The external camera is utterly worthless in that once it is turned on it will not turn off...ever. When it is on it sends a completely erratic and distorted picture image to the camera. The only way this product could possible be used is if I was willing to record an entirely different sound track and then match the video and sound together...what a hassle.The camera is past it's warranty and I am stuck with it...total junk."
2,A honest review of the SC X105L.,"I wrote an honest review of the SC-X105L this fall - read it and hope for the perfect helmet camera system - the SCX105L is not it!There is a good usability review over at <a href=""http://helmetcameracentral.com"">http://helmetcameracentral.com </a>- look under the reviews section. The variety of videos on this site also represents a good slice of the conditions under which people use helmet camera systems."
2,This camera sucks,"poor video quality, lack of memory for a couple of hundred more you can get so much more..."
5,Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina: Missa Papae Marcelli; Missa Brevis,"This is a magnificent 16th century mass, one of the most beautiful ever written. I can't wait to listen to the whole thing."
2,Not what I expected,"As compared to other tarot/oracle decks I have seen, these cards were, in every way, inferior. The minor arcana were all line drawings from DaVinci's notebooks - monochrome... non-descript... often having nothing to do with the meaning of the card. The card stock, itself, was thin. I didn't read thru the book, so I can't comment on the value of it. Overall, I would say this set is cheap."
2,arbitrary art,"the cards are not laminated, the art ois good but irrelivent to the themes. i would not recomand this deck. I own about 20 terot decks now."
3,Hiking Wisconsin's Lake Superior Shores,"This is the companion book to the Minnesota North Shore handbook with the same ""Gentle Hikes"" title. On the North Shore the distinction between ""gentle hikes"" and more ambitious ones is quite relevant because there are hundreds of miles of backpacking trails through the mountainous and river-strewn terrain of the North Shore.In contrast, Wisconsin's South Shore is by nature more gentle terrain so ""Gentle Hikes-Wisconsin"" becomes a fairly comprehensive guide to the hiking opportunities along Wisconsin's Lake Superior shore area. The book also covers picnic areas and waysides of interest to the traveler."
5,Tissot Rocks!,"I bought my first Tissot in 1992. I loved it! Although I have replaced the battery many times, I have never had any problems with the watch itself. The crystal is amazing!! No scratches ever!! I am only buying a new one because I felt the old one deserved some time off. I love these watches!!!"
2,One of the worst WWE home videos ever!,"When I bought this DVD, I was expecting to get some behind the scenes footage with John Cena. But what i got was a bunch of footage that I've seen many times. Compared to other WWE videos, this was not very detailed. It seems like they put this DVD together in less than an hour. It was relatively short and I was very disappointed with the content. Unless you're a diehard John Cena fan, don't but this DVD. Take your $25 and but a PPV that lasts 3 times as long!!!"
1,WWE open your eyes!,"Cena sucks and is an insult to wrestling and the now jolk of a WWE title which was created for this no talent bum. Hopefully we wont have to ""See him"" much longer."
4,John Cena is Great,"This DVD was awesome at first but theres one thing tht i saw after i watched it like 5 times. I saw tht no of hes niggest matchs were there at the one time. But other then tht there was alot of cool things he did at tht time. I liked his rap battles. My favorite was with The Big Show. my faovrite line was when Cena said, ""Not your rap carrer is over theres no room 4 a 500 pound talking peaice of [...]. Then the part with the Micmans. And theres 1 more problum but it wasnt tht big 2 make it a 3 star and tht was about half of the movie was with Brock Lesnar and John Cena figthing. The Undertaker one was better cuz it wasnt as big as Brocks rilvery. Wrestlemania was a good part. But there was 2 problums tht could have been solved if the moive was made now"
1,"All together now ""Cena SUCKS, Cena SUCKS......""","We've Cen-enough,when will the WWE stop pushing John Cena, lets be fair he came into the company as a jobber, and a jobber he should be. I saw parts of this DVD on a John Cena special on cable and it did not convince me to give him a chance. He has no wrestling abilty, he can;t cut promo's without sounding like a cross between Stone Cold and The Rock, his character consists of doing a poor impressions of a black man (Booker T does a far better job because he is a black man, unlike Cena, who just plays one on TV).Instead of pushing Cena, they should have pushed Vanillia Ice, his just like Cena, except he might be able to wrestle."
2,Disappointing,"This dvd doesnt really do much justice for Cena. It was rushed in a hurry but for what purpose? The matches are good but the documentary on him is where it sucks. It forgets he beat Angle in his first match, and just kind of skips around to when he first started to rap. The raps are good for a few times around, espeically against Big Show. If your a Cena fan you might enjoy it , but there is alot left out."
2,disappointing,"I'm a huge John Cena fan, and this dvd was just not at all what I expected. It's just him and his posse of bald white dudes sitting around and talking about his freestyles. The full matches were good, but there wasn't really a lot of information about him outside of wrestling. i wish they had some of his matches form OVW or something like that. maybe even from his stint on Manhunt or whatever...but nothing. Just a bunch of freestyles, most of which are hard to hear cause they didn't edit the sounds of the fans out or anything. if you can rent it instead of buy it...do that instead...it's definitely not worth the 20 bucks i paid for it."
2,Not Worth the $$,"The only reason why WWE made this DVD was to capitalize on how over John Cena is on the fans. John Cena's had a limited career at the time this DVD was made, so not many note worthy matches. The ""special features"" weren't that great either.Get it if you must, but it's not really worth it. WWE should have waited until after Wrestlemania 20 to even think about making a John Cena DVD."
5,Word Life,"I loved this DVD! I am a HUGE John Cena fan and enjoyed this much more than 'Here Comes The Pain' or '619'. I believe John did a great job and put in funny segments and highlights of his career. i hope this isn't the only one and that John releases another DVD later in his career. It has good matches, good clips and great features. A definite buy for WWE fans. And for those of you don't like it, you obviously haven't been watching the same DVD as me. A great buy overall."
5,GREAT COMBINATION OF SPIRIT AND DISCIPLINE,"I read this book over the course of a week and thoroughly delved into it, not so much because its words were profound, but because the authors do a great job of helping the reader understand what it takes to walk in the Spirit daily. They discuss basic disciplines like prayer, bible study, fellowship, witnessing, solitude, and sacrifice and help the reader understand how each discipline draws us to the Holy Spirit. They also explain how to balance our role in drawing near to God and the Spirit's role in empowering us for God's glory so that we can lose more of ourselves and become like Christ. We are going to use this book in our Christian small group study. I would highly recommend it to all who are serious about yielding to the Spirit consistently and pursuing all of your resources in Christ! FIVE STARS!!"
5,Great switch on a budget price.,This switch is simple to setup and has features that you would pay considerable more for. I have nothing negative to say...small form for a large package.
5,Note SECOND edition,Note that this new SECOND edition published in 2003 is a completely different book than the first edition referred to by some earlier reviewers.Dr. Sponenberg is a leader in this field and does a great job of bringing the latest in color genetic theory to the lay horseman.
4,Equine Color Genetics,"I have the 1st edition. It was my main tool in figuring out the Grullo color genetics. There are some minor inaccuracies in color theory, but this is the best single color book that I know of on the market. For a more complete picture of color genetics I recommend, in addition, Equine Genetics & Selection Procedures, published by Equine Research, they are on the web if Amazon don't carry their books. As an example of the differences between the 2 books, Equine Genetics discusses the Isabella color which Sponenberg omits. I don't know about the genetics of Isabella, but it is real, and I can now spot them easily. Isabellas are dark yellow, with little or no white, there manes are often yellow too. Palominos have as much white as sorrels.Sponenberg does an excellent treatment of the champayne color, it is very rare in Quarter horses, but Sponenberg tells you how to spot them. I have since seen several.If you are only going to get one color book, get this one."
2,Undermining the Beauty of Mexican Culture,"Good Neighbors is plagued with comparisons between the United States and Mexican culture. Presenting the material in this way is by no means objective and burns more bridges than it builds. Exhibiting cultural material as a ratioed math problem: X culture=this while Y culture=this, is an unfair comparison. Each culture is rich and diverse in its own right and Condon fails to get this message to his reader. It is a good book if you want to understand American culture...NOT Mexican culture."
3,Great toy... suprise results,"My birds love this toy. It's by far their favorite in the cage. The only problem I've seen is that they tend to un-tie the beads rather quickly, and at one point one of my birds had gotten caught in the strings and nearly hung herself! Good thing I was in the room when it happened.I fixed the strings so that she wouldn't get caught again, and it still hangs in their cage. They get made whenever I try to remove it. Over all a great toy. Just be sure to watch your bird's behavior with it."

2,Only the Rumble itself was good,All the matches were too short as if they were short in time. Rey vs Noble 3mins ?! The main event between HHH and HBK was disapointing. They had a 2 times better match on Raw earlier. The Rumble itself is one of the best i've seen in my 20 years i've been watching wrestling.

4,Grandma time,"My grandson is 6 years old and introduced me to the Goosebumps series.I have ordered the ones he picked out and we look forward to quiet time and reading the stories together. The chapters end in such a way that he wants to keep reading. I do get animated for him and he loves it. It gives me a time out from the high impact activites of a 6 year old.This story was a lot of fun for us. I showed him my grool (under my sink) to his amazement. I like that there is a theme to learn. In this case, ""be kind"""
4,It came from beneath the sink!,"This book isn't one of r.l. stines best, but it wasn't one of his worst either. It was just alright. This book was also interesting to. This book is about a girl named kat and her brother, I can't remember his name. They just moved into a new house. Kat finds a weird sponge under the sink. Ever since Kat found the sponge bad things have been happening. I took off one star for this book because it seemed kind of strange that a sponge would give people bad luck. I think they could of used something else instead of sponge, like something more scary. This book was alright and it is still worth reading."
3,If there's a lesson to be learned,"ISBN 059048348X - If there's a lesson to be learned from this book, it's that cleaning can't lead to anything good - so get the kids to clean under the sink before they read it. They may never do it again.Kat and her family have moved into a huge new house and get right to work cleaning it up. Kat's first job? Clean the kitchen cabinets. Simple enough, but not in Stine's world. Kat finds a small, sponge-like item that seems to be alive and thrives on bad luck. With the help of her younger brother, Daniel, Kat has to figure out what she's dealing with and how to defeat it - before it kills her!It's a quick read, and not particularly scary. Kids, of course, will like it, if only for supplying them another excuse to not help Mom clean.- AnnaLovesBooks"
3,Not as good as you would think,"I really adore R.L. Stine but this book didn't intrigue me. The beginning was mediocre, the middle of the book was a little interesting. But the end was horrendously terrible. I felt this was a waste of my time and my money, sorry."
4,A girl that finds a living spung that is a bad luck charm.,"This book is about a ordinary girl that moves into a new house, finds a living sponge under the sink, and it turns out to be a bad luck charm."
3,an okay book,it was an okay book but when i saw it first i thought that this story is so cool but when i read it i didn't like it that much to tell u the truth it wasn't interesting it wasn't scary and the ending was the worst i'm sorry to say that but it is the truth it's all about a girl finds a sponge beneath the sink but then she relised that it is not a sponge coz it is breathing and it is alive and it's called the grool and it brings bad luck for her and her family even it ruins her birthday and she knows that if she throws it away she will die within one day !!! and it can't be killed by violence.........
5,Detailed and thorough,"The book lives up to the title. It assumes that you're comfortable with multivariate calculus and linear algebra, including things like using Lagrange's method to find extrema of functions. If you're looking for a less precise treatment, _Investments_ by Brodie et al. might be a better choice, but if you need the math, it's all here."
3,Please do something about notation.,The content of this book is good and the discussion quite good as well. However - and this is an extremely important point - PLEASE do something about the horrible notation in future editions!!
5,A Straight Forward Text Book,"It's a textbook. That being said, it is filled with extra material, like case examples, a CD-ROM, etc. I didn't look at any of that because my business law class went at such a slow pace we only looked at about 10 of the chapters. If you are buying this for a class, you should come away with a lot of good information from this book without feeling it is too much of a boring chore to read through."
4,Business Law,"The book is in good condition some highlighting, but I knew that in advance.Delivery was before my class started, which was great."
1,SUCKS!!!!,"Damn this video sucks. It's nothing like previous Anti Hero videos. There's way too much talking (and DUMB talking) and scenery shots, and very little skating. There's about 5 minutes worth of impressive skating, about 5 minutes worth of boring skating, and 20 minutes worth of crap. I'm severly dissapointed because I love the other Anti Hero videos and I was looking forward to a good non-handrail oriented video. Don't buy this just because you dig everything else Anti Hero-related. If you want a very crappy version of Hurley's ""Hallowed Ground"" then you've found it."
5,Nice enough to hang inside the house!,The face is a resin cast which looks exactly like it is a original wood carving. Overall the unit is very well built and is a bargain at $25.
1,a pale reflection,"Bypassing the Banshees' punk roots, this revisionist collection does little credit to London's avatars of the agony of ecstasy. Eleven of disc one's tracks were previously compiled on ONCE UPON A TIME and TWICE UPON A TIME. The so-called 'new' song ""Dizzy"" is an alternate version of a single sold on their 2002 tour. The selections skirt the Banshees' primal premiere, THE SCREAM, the underrated follow-up, JOIN HANDS, and 1982's delirious A KISS IN THE DREAMHOUSE. The 1978 pop hit ""Hong Kong Garden"" is the only (and highly uncharacteristic) evidence of the early, pre-Budgie lineup. Superb sound underscores the urgency of the need for a remastered Banshees back catalog. Why disc two is padded with remixes is a mystery, as there are dozens of original B-side songs that never been issued on CD."
2,"been there, done that","As most posted reviews have stated, the majority of these songs have been released on previous singles collections (but what singles they are !!!). I bought this one because of the 12"" remixes on the bonus cd. I must admit I was let down by most of them, the only one I still listen to is the 12"" mix of Kiss them For Me. The remainder is for collectors, serious fans and completists."
2,Bummer! Extended versions are edited!!!,"Another reviewer mentioned that Spellbound is an edit of the 12"" version. I was hoping to have the full Silver Dollar mix of Peek-a-Boo on CD...but unfortunately, this song is also edited, missing about a minute and a half of the full length 12"" version! I don't have any of Siouxsie's other 12"" singles, so I don't know if the others are edited, but be prepared for the possibility if you're looking to replace that old vinyl."
3,"Once again, the record companies have shafted us","After having read most of the other reviews for this CD here, I agree with the majority. Except for the remastering, there was simply no point to this release, as the Once and Twice Upon a Singles CD's are more extensive and work better as greatest hits packages. As a compilation, this CD is too random to be effective and only gives the slightest glimpse as to what a great catalogue this band has. I was happy to have extended versions that were previously released on 12"" singles on vinyl, but was crushed upon listening to the extended version of ""Spellbound"" and realizing it had been edited. What's the point, then? I hear that a B-sides box set is set for release in the summer of 2004; I can only hope that if and when it sees the light of day, it is given the proper treatment that this band and its fans deserve."
4,Neat!,"Although I don't read Czech, this book is a fascinating Czech dictionary of heraldry, illustrated sufficiently to nearly make the text superfluous."
4,A bit uneven but worth the purchase,"The version of ""Cold Duck Time"" played by Adam Klipple and Drive-By Leslie on this compilation CD is alone worth the price of admission. Having said that, as a fan of the Hammond organ blues and soul-jazz played by Jack McDuff and others, I'm left wondering why some of the other selections were included here. For the most part we're not talking about tunes that Jack McDuff played, nor are we treated to interpretations of tunes in a style that evokes his style. So although this CD is marketed as a homage to Jack McDuff, it really does not qualify as one. Nevertheless for any fan of the Hammond there is plenty to enjoy here."
5,Dead On T- Shirt.,"This was a favorite T-shirt for a while, but as you might guess white gets dirty fast on the job. Oh well it provided a few laughs. The shirt is a GILDAN Ultra Cotton. I am happy with this order, and would recommend it."
3,Now I have TWO,"I liked Nathan Haines to the point where I didn't check the songs on the cd. Once I received it, I realized that I already had the songs on previous cds. While I'm not upset, I hate spending unnecessary funds."
4,"As if I was there, sort of","I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to history from this time period, so from that perspective, I think this book was informative and engaging. I suggest you read it if you have even an inkling of interest in the time period, because once you get into it, McCullough will take care of getting you through it with his detail and suspense. My only two warnings: 1) it takes a few chapters to get into it, especially remembering all the characters, and 2) when you finish it you're thirsting for more information about the coming battles and years. Enjoy."
4,Great history lesson,"Great book, gives you a different perspective into the individuals that are part of that time in history."
4,illuminating,"This book is not perfect, but I enjoyed it and I recommend it to those who need encouragement in the face of failure. I think what Mr. McCullough was going for were the things we may not expect to read about the Revolutionary War and I appreciate that. My 17-year-old homeschooled kid did not enjoy it, but he has only experienced success in his very short life and has yet to grasp the importance of the dangers and uncertainty of those who rebelled for the sake of our freedoms."
4,Inside the mind of George Washington,"A fascinating tale, written from inside the minds of both the British and US military leadership. Its peppered with keen insights taken from the documents and letters the American""rebel"" leaders wrote to their families, and augmented with the McCulloch's analysis. Not only did I enjoy it, but I learned quite a bit in the process."
4,My first McCullough work,"This was my first David McCullough that I've had the pleasure of reading. I'd like to consider myself a history buff but that might be a bit strong. I have an interest in history and all things American. I would say this is a great start to the ""real"" Amearican history. It's an easy read and I didn't have a problem staying interested. It wasn't so dry in other words. The reason I gave it 4 x stars vs 5 is because it's my first McCullough. I look forward to getting into, ""John Adams""."
3,Not fun reading most of the time,"I did not read this when it came out since I thought I knew enough about the subject matter. But since the other six books by McCullough that I have read are such outstanding books I decided I should read this too. It tells well the story of Washington from the time he assumed command of the Army in 1775 thru the battles of Trenton and Princeton in 1776 and 1777. There is mkuch doleful matter, and I could not find it enjoyable to read of the travail that Washington had to go through during 1776. So I cannot say most of the book was enjoyable reading. But it ends on an up note, what with the victories at Trenton and at Princeton. And the last few pages do leave one with a good feeling for the book. ( As an aside note, I was surprised at the account of Nathan Hale--much less to it than I always assumed.)"
3,Good read but a little too ahgiographic.,I read this on holiday. I like reading about 18th century military history. I found this well written and engaging but too .. trite almost. The Hessians are described as mercenaries - this implies something immoral but they were hired by Britain from treaties with their home states as Britain had done for years. I see this book as a readable starting point for study of this part of the war. I think what is needed is a British account of the war that provides the kind of balance begun by Macksey.
5,Great book!,I was surprised to know what really happened in 1776. It was a great year with many challenges. I enjoyed reading this book.
4,"The good, the bad, the review","Gives a real feel for the year of 1776, you see that we as a country are lucky to be here.But too much effort was put into excerpts from personal letters, it got distracting.Certainly worth reading, but thought if he had wrote the book like his summary on television with Tim Russert, it would have been better."
2,"Over-priced eBook, missing images from DTB, poor quality map and figure images.","Over-priced eBook, missing images from DTB, poor quality map and figure images.(Same thing with the iBookStore version.)Simon & Schuster needs to commit more energy towards making quality eBooks (with great formatting, indexing, chapter navigation, and graphics) and less energy towards raising eBook pricing."
2,Dull and Boring -- No Maps,"Dull and boring sum up my opinion of this book. What a struggle to get through it. And how do you produce a book about battles, troop movements, and fortifications with NO MAPS? Beats me, but this author and his publisher seem to think readers don't need this type of graphical information. Maybe everyone knows where the Harlem River is and how Washington positioned his troops on Long Island. The included reproductions of ancient unreadable maps do not do the trick. If you want to read history with some life to it, try Jeff Shaara's, ""The Glorious Cause."" Although billed as historical fiction, you get a better feeling for the personalities and challenges of 1776. Yes, Shaara's book has good maps."
3,Not Very Good!,"I would rather recommend people to read Shaara's Glorious Cause again rather than read McCullough's 1776, and this is coming from a reader who loved McCullough's John Adams. Shaara communicates more and communicates better and fiction v non-fiction is not an issue; come on, what's the difference between fiction's ""he thought"" and non-fiction's ""he may have been thinking""?"
2,Confusing analysis of Washington,"This is a strange book. On the one hand it is very well written, engaging, and it illuminates the events of the revolutionary war in 1776 very well. On the other hand, the events of that year do NOT confirm the perspective that McCollough chooses to take toward his subject. The author clearly adopts the noble, father-of-his-country attitude toward Washington but then, simultaneously and confusingly, describes the military events of 1776 that show his hero as an ineffective, hesitant, and, arguably, incompetent leader. I therefore found the book unsatisfying and somewhat incoherent."
5,well written period summary of the year's events 1776,As well written as McCullough is generally who also has a flare for bringing the reader in to the period to understand the differences between our current time and the time in the book.
4,Very informative/inspiring.,"I love Mcullough's writing style as well as his reading style. It is both low-key and inspiring at the same time. We Americans need to listen to/read this wonderfully researched book or other such works related to our country's struggle to exist. Over and aver the reader is made aware of the sacrifices made by all of the brave men and women (and even children) of the time. I have only listened to the CD thus far, and am listening to the book a second time. I also own the book and will be enjoying that as well, I'm sure."
4,If you slept through history class then read this book,And if you want more then I recommend reading Ron Chernow's Alexander Hamilton as a follow up. The two books obviously share a common chronology yet give different perspectives on an incredibly rich period of American history.
5,"The ""Creme de la Creme"" of History Novels","David McCullough simply outdid himself in writing 1776. Although I am a history buff (especially Early American history), this book would appeal to everyone. The author is so thorough in his descriptions of the leaders, battles, settings, and outcomes of the Revolutionary War period. It is a fast read as well. Reading this book would give you greater insight into the mind-sets of those leaders in the Continental Congress supporting the war effort, the British and Hessian forces, and especially the Patriot ""rebels"" sacrificng everything for the freedom of our nation."
4,"An enjoyable and informative read, well worth my time.","This book was a great read. Exciting and informative. I did not realize how close the Continental Army came to losing the war. If not for General Howe's caution and General Washington's resolve, we may still be under British control. David McCullough did a great job writing this book. I did, however, catch myself skimming over some paragraphs. I felt that he was a little too descriptive about some of the characters. I was suprised at how abruptly the book ended. I was left wanting more. But to be fair, this book is about the year 1776 and not the entire Revolutionary War. Overall, I enjoyed it and it was well worth my time."
5,George W. of 1776 and Dubya of 2005,"The story was a revelation to me...it seemed that the Revolution was just an aspect of our manifest destiny, with Green Mountain boys in scrufty clothes waging an insurgency from behind trees at those bumbling red coats lined up in straight lines waiting to be knocked over by Osama bin Washington's rabble. Not so. George W. (Washington, as well as Bush) is a leader with feet of clay, both with a decision process that is deeply flawed. Loved the narration by author on the CD version...makes you pull over to load the next disk."
5,Timely Read,"In a time when American ""exceptionalism"" is seemingly on the wane, this book reminds one of the fortitude of the people of these our United States. McCullough leads the reader on an exciting trip back to some of the darkest days of our great land, proving that when things seem bleak, we as a people can take heart and forge ahead to brighter days."
4,The dark days of the Revolution,"I really enjoyed this book. It was fascinating to read about how close the Continental Army was to loosing the war for independence. The story of George Washington's leadership against seemingly insurmountable conditions was very inspiring on a human level. I only whish this would have been a longer book, I wanted to keep going with the story after I was finished with the book."
5,An exceptional snapshot...,"I really enjoyed this entire audio book. The author read it well and the pace was ideal. I appreciated the lack of sound effects and found the CDs and audio to be of good quality. There are those who say the story is narrow and limited, but not even a history book can cover all aspects of an event or mention every player. McCullough focused on a specific group of participants in only one year of the war. It was informative, surprising, warm and educational. The audio book is great... so enthralling you won't even know you're learning something. Recommended."
1,I Am So Tired But There Is Still...,This book is very pooring! It is good medicine for you who have insomnia.
4,Well-written historical non-fiction,McCullough does a decent job of writing detailed non-fiction while keeping it from sounding too dry. Easier to read than most non-fiction.
4,Great Place to Start,"This may not be the definitive book about the Revolutionary War, but it is a great place to start learning more about American History. It's meant to be a companion book to the biography ""John Adams"" and it serves its purpose well.I like history, and I love the way that David McCullough conveys history not as a set of dates, places, and events, but as stories. He brings each historical figure to life and has a unique way of teaching history that I think most readers will enjoy.Do yourself a favor and pick up ""John Adams"" too and read them both."
5,Fun read.,"In typical McCullough style, this book reads like a novel. I was genuinely disappointed when I realized that it actually stopped at the end of the year 1776. Perhaps I should've seen that coming.If you're not familiar with the Revolutionary War, you'll want to keep a pen/paper handy to keep track of the names.Really enjoyable read."
3,A Big Disappointment,"McCullough missed a golden opportunity to tell a great story, warts and all, in his highly readable prose. Instead, he chose to go over much the same territory as David Hackett Fischer's ""Washington's Crossing."" If 1776 was such a pivotal year McCullough could have spent more time discussing the events and intrigues in Philadelphia, London and the other capitals of Europe. He could have provided us with a marvelous story pulling together all the main characters in a narrative that would have read like a novel and yet be imformative. Instead he chose to concentrate on the battles, something Fischer does with more detail."
3,good read for the beginner,"Davic McCullough writes good books; I have several and have enjoyed them very much. 1776 is a good read for someone who hasn,t read much about the revolution. It lacks maps, other than contemporary ones, and the narrative flow is a bit jerky. He hasn't yet injected his notions of what the historic characters ""must have been thinking"", and this is a plus."
5,Excellent book but kindle e-book is ovepriced.,Excellent book but kindle e-book is overpriced. This book has been out for 5 years and the publisher want $13.99 for Kindle e-book. The paperback is $7.00 or $10.71 at Amazon. Get the paperback.
4,HURRIED ENDING,"For the most part i really enjoyed this book. i dont usually read history novels but i found it to be very enjoyable especially all of the personal accounts that gave you a real sense of the conditions at the time.My disappointment lies at the end of the book. i found it to be very hurried and incomplete.there should have been a big ending,a climax... afterall we did win our freedom and independace and it was hardly mentioned.that being said i would recommend this book. i found it to be very insightful."
4,Great book; poorly narrated,"If you liked David McCullough's other books, you will like this one as well. One word of caution; the audio cassettes are narrated by the author. This is unfortunate, as his performance is adequate at best. Excellent narration can make relatively dense material lively and accessible. McCullough's narration makes an outstanding piece of writing somewhat harder to follow than it needs to be."
2,Have I read this before?,"That's what I kept asking myself when reading the first few chapters of this book. I've read other books on the revolutionary period, but I expected a fresh and detailed approach from this author. Instead, what I got seemed like a rehash of what I had read numerous times before. McCullough's ""The Great Bridge"" and ""The Path Between The Seas"" were great and original ideas done in an interesting and informative style, but this book is basically a junior-high-school-level introduction to the subject. Forget the hype, this book is a potboiler."
3,Good read but biased,This is an entertaining read but very biased against the British; some of the stories of American actions are laughably exaggerated to the extent that the are just impossible to believe. Washington too is elevated to the extent that at some points you feel you are a reading a bible to him rather than a history book.So i wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for a British perspective of the war. But if you want a patriotically stirring story from an american perspective then this is highly recommended.
3,"Good story, Bad history","No serious review can deny that David McCullough is a master storyteller, and I am happy to say that 1776 is one of the few books about history that is readable and flows. In stark contrast to many American histories, which tend to be inaccessible discourses written by historians from the ivy tower, this books great success is that it brings American history to the masses. However, it is very likely that the reader of 1776 will take very little worthwhile information from this book. Where his narrative ability excels, we find little in the way of critical analysis. No time is spent on the roots of revolution, and a scant page is spent on the Declaration of Independence.In the end, the reader is left hungry for a good narrative of substance, and this most certainly will not satiate the intellectual appetite."
4,Wish there was more,Slow starting book that soon became very interesting. Thought the ending was too abrubt. Have read His Excellency by Ellis and John Adams by McCullogh. Would recommend His Excellency as a companion to this book as it provides more information on Washington to his death.
4,Entertaining and Informative,"David McCullough makes history entertaining and engaging. The individuals followed in this book are presented as real people as opposed to the legendary, larger than life characters that we usually think of. This book is easy to read and reminded me of the incredible sacrifices made by our founding generation. This was my second book by David McCullough and I will definitely read more."
5,Exceptional,"If my high school history class was taught in the fashion of this book, it would have been much more interesting. The story unfolds in dramatic prose. Winning this war was no easy task. If I didn't already know the ending (who won the war), I would have bet on the British. As a U.S. citizen, this is history, I feel I should know... and am glad to have learned.Jay Winner, M.D., author of Stress Management Made Simple: Effective Ways to Beat Stress for Better Health"
3,A Fair Overview,"The author's writing is fine and the narrative flows smoothly. The story is fascinating, and, if one needs a brief look at the (mainly) military side of events early in the war, this book can be useful. Beginning about mid-way through 1775, the story works through its title year and early 1777, providing a clear picture of the difficulties Washington and his Continental soldiers experienced. However, most of the research comes from published sources, with a couple of notable exceptions, and some battles, for example, White Plains, are glossed over so quickly one best not blink. There is nothing new here, but, for someone beginning a study of the Revolution, this might be a nice place to learn some basics. Having read the author's biography of Adams, I was disappointed overall."
3,"Nice, but too short","How dare one critique McCllough? Well,here goes. While I liked the book, it was very long on footnotes and references (almost a bibliography) and is woefully short on details. As a quick review of the year 1776, it is ok; as a 'history', it lacks the depth one has come to expect of the author."
4,Companion book to John Adams,A great read and could can be read at the same time as John Adams or by itself.Filled with information that most people would never learn in our schools today.
5,David McCullough 1776,Excellent book looked at various places and amazon was found to be the cheapest and very fast shipping
4,enjoyable and well paced,"This is a well paced book. It is never dull, and provides a lot of insight and detail including personal insight from Washinton, et al. It is easy going as well as informative and entertaining."
1,Poorly Written,"This book is poorly written and has no continuity. The author jumps from topic to topic with no transitions, making it quite difficult to follow. I would have stopped reading this hours ago if I did not have to suffer through it for a college course."
2,Bad,"The problem with this book and the rest of McCulloch's books is that he is a ""pop historian."" He gives his story and facts in the tradional America is god approach, and glorifies traditional American heroes like George Washington. Rather than invesitigating the culutural effects of the American Revolution, McCulloch spits out another military history book that doesn't discuss the consequences of war but how cool it it is. If you want a good history of the revolution try A People's History of the American Revolution or just read a few pages of Howard Zinn."
1,Very Informative,The letters and direct statements from the various participants in the early Revolution made this a fascinating reading. It helped me realiaze how close our country came to losing that war. It makes me think that the problems we have now are minor compared to what our founding fathers had to face.
5,Excellent History Book that Reads Like a Novel,"This book is every bit as good as the other evaluations have noted. This is the best researched history book that I've read in the last year, and it reads like a novel. Mr. McCullough has researched it all - the major characters, even some of the minor characters, the period, the areas, the battles, everything. I especially like the little anecdotes about Washington and his generals and also the British generals. It was interesting to read the disputes in Parliament about what to do about the Americas. There are some beautiful pictures and maps of the area also included. Excellent book."
4,Become a part of the story of liberty,"This book humanizes the greatest story of freedom ever written. The assumption of command of the Continental Army by a 40 something, self educated farmer. Washington is seen as a man's man, larger than life, and proves to be America's first super hero. Seeing his leadership, not in light of his success but in light of his failures, Washington is the classic hero. The unlikely and unwilling choice, an amazing first victory, then almost wallowing in despair in his darkest hour before the hero rises to victory.....and takes a nation with him."
5,On the Brink,"I'm a decent student of American Histrory, or at least thought I was. Reading this well crafted and well researched book showed me that my understanding of the military progress of the American Revolution was flawed. What an eye opener.Washington in his full greatness was overwhelmed by his job and the task at hand much of the time. The whole thing is filled with hairs-breadth escapes from total destruction of the Continental Army. I previously understood that the might of England reached across the Atlantic, but never really had the perspective to understand the degree of that power. I do now. We just barely made it.This is a history book that reads like a novel. And a good one, at that."
3,A good review of an important year,"This is a good, concise, journeyman work that reviews the important military events of 1776. It's not great literature and there's a lot of context of the year (political, economic, social) that is glossed over, but if you're looking for a ""starter"" reader of the military campaigns of the war, this is a very good one."
3,Boring and disappointing,"I was quite excited to get the latest book from David McCullough since the last two I read Truman and John Adams were superb reads. When I first starting the book it seemed as though I started in the middle and took a good 50 pages to figure out what was going on. It is obviously the material was heavily researched but it did not come alive in the pages of this book. I finally gave up reading it half way through the book. Rather than tell a story, the booked seem to jump from one fact to another. Quite frankly, each time I started reading it I had to put the book down and take a short nap. I think I'll go back and re-read some of his better works."
2,Boring Book,"I love studying history. I love doing genealogy.However, this book presented FACTS FACTS FACTS just as boringly done as my high school history classes. I was very disappointed in this book. The author should have done better!"
2,A surprisingly boring read,"I was looking forward to reading 1776--as I have read and enjoyed all of the other books by McCullough that I've read--perhaps I've read too much about this period, but the book is just boring. I couldn't truly finish it.Sad--just a rehash of old material."
2,reads like a history book...,"Overrated. If you know nothing of the time period perhaps it is interesting but if you have studied any American history or watched any movies such as the Patriot, this is a boring rehash."
3,"Great book, poor shipping package","I had to return the book. Amazon had poorly packaged it allowing it to slide around in the shipping box unwrappped and poorly protected. Consequently, the book was dented in transit, and as a ""coffee table"" book was unacceptable for display."
3,Not Typical McCullough,"Mr. McCullough has written so many better books. It's still better than average but I expect so much more from him. It was too short. There's about 100 pages of notes and bibliography. Only about 290 pages of text. Feels too rushed and I thought there would be more on Washington plus what was going on in 1776 with Adams, Franklin, and Jefferson. There wasn't any exploration of Hamilton or Arnold either. Just not what I expected from McCullough."
3,Less than It Is,"It was ok, but less than outstanding. Like most of Davids books it is quite long---nearly 300 pages---and takes a long time to read. I would have like to have seen real photos (instead of black and white paintings)of Washington and his crew and of George the King, but the writer included none.. After 300 pages and weeks of reading, we don't even get to learn who won the war.I saw David on PBS and find his talking easier to follow that his writing. I also believe that one could watch Mel Gibsons classic ""The Patriot"" and learn as much about the era and be finished learning in 2 hours.I am a teacher at famous language school in Japan and know a thing or too about teaching, and while this book is fine for the over-motivated historical enthusist, it is overdone for the general public. It is OK though, just don't expect alot of excitement."
4,This Books Needs A DECENT MAP,"If you think things look troublesome today, you should have been there in 1776. And if you want to understand how a relatively few insurgents who truly believe in their cause can upset the plans of a mighty military, it is all here.McCullough writes it from a journalist point of view, and it almost seems as though you are reading a news account with background and analysis.While I REALLY like this book, I found the pictures of the English maps of the time almost useless, and there was no map that covered upper Manhattan where many of the battles he covered took place.There ought to be a law that all books like this must come with a general map with the author getting a gold star if he/she includes maps showing how the battles unfold.Craig Rodby"
2,A real disappointment,"Sorry to say this book is not nearly up to the standard set with McCulloch classics like Truman and John Adams. If you want to read a whole lot of, albeit, interesting quotes from Continental Army soldiers bemoaning the conditions they fought in, this might be the book for you. If you want to see Washington portrayed first as indecisive and then lucky, this might also be the book for you. Also, I have to agree that limiting the book to 1776 made for an all together unsatisfying read.If this book marks a decline in McCulloch's output as a writer, it will be a shame, but it will not take away from his other magnificent efforts. If you have haven't tried McCulloch before, you can't go wrong reading Truman, Adams, or the Path Between the Seas."
2,I expected More,"I am very disapointed in 1776 by David McCullough. In my opinion it is simply not up to the standard he set by his terrific biography of Truman or his wonderful story of the Panama Canal, The Path Between the Seas.That part of 1776 about the battle of Trenton does not begin to compare to narrative on the same subject in the book, Washington's Crossing by David Hacket Fischer; a book I recommend to all having an interest in that part of our history.SRW"
2,Not his best work,"I'm going to go against the grain and say that I did not like this book. It was long-winded, rambling, and more than a little disjointed. I am normal a huge face of his work (Truman is one of my favorite biographies of all time). But this book seemed like he gathered up all the scraps from his Adams biography and dumped it into this book."
2,Could have been better,"I was looking forward to reading this book. Wanted to learn so much more about the founding fathers of this great country.However, this book was way too flat for my tastes. These were such great men, and I felt their stories needed to be told far more eloquently and detailed, than what was done here.Wish I could find a better written book on the same topic."
4,The Rest of the Story,"If you thought you knew the story of the American Revolution, read this book and be amazed at what you did not know. This book cuts through the myths and fantisis we all grew up with, and tells the gritty truth of what it was really like in 1776, the individual leaders, soldiers, and civilians. It also convays just how close it came for the revolution, which was not supported by much of the population, to have failed. It also tells of the genius and forsight of many unsung hero to which we owe so much. The book is well organized and an easy read. The book is necessarily dry is some places."
5,1776 - Mc Cullough,I purchased this book for a friend and he has really enjoyed it. I can't waiting until I can start reading it also. Thanks for having a prompt mailing service also.
3,1776 by David McCullough contains an inexcusable ommission,"1776 is a ""can't put down"" page turner. It keenly depicts the suffering paid by our colonist to gain freedom. However, it is beyond my comprehension how McCullough could write a book about the Revolutionary War in the year of 1776 using Washington's attack on the Hessions at Trento New Jersey on Christmaas morniing as the book's climax and not mention a word about Valley Forge. The name Valley Forge doesn't even show up in the Index!Moving the troups from Valley Forge to the Delaware River was a huge part of the strife in prepairing for the battle. For me, this killed the book at the very end.Richard D. Whiteford"
5,Vivid and Living History,"David McCullough shows his great powers as a writer and historian by taking one of the most well traveled roads in American history, the year 1776, and bringing it to life with great vividness, depth and vivacity. McCullough knows how to structure a story, to reveal and then to conceal, to create, for a reader familiar with the general outline of a story, a compelling reason to read and return to his book. And here is the great strength of 1776: there is still the sense that the outcome of the American Revolution is very much up for grabs; that what we consider the foregone conclusion, that America will gain its independence, was never really true. 1776, what we judge as a great year in American history, was actually a year of extreme anxiety, uncertainty, of stumbles and mistakes, of accidents and disasters large and small. Only in retrospect would it become the grand starting point of our national existence."
5,Excellent detail,"David McCullough always does great research for his books and ""1776"" is no exception. The detail of the battles was very informative. I knew the overall American Revolution story, but enjoyed reading about the battles and just how close we were to losing this war."
5,What a Close Thing!,Interesting book. I had no idea the Revolutionary War was so close to being lost. McCullough defintely knows how to keep your attention fastened on the narrative. Recommended.
4,For those who aren't historians...,"This book is great, but a little drawn-out for me -- someone who doesn't need to know EVERY excruciating detail about the entire year. I found myself often wanting to simply get to the point where we find out what happens and not have to keep trudging through dozens of letters that Washington wrote each chapter. Don't get me wrong--the detail is what brings the whole Revolutionary War to a whole new understanding and is what makes the book so spectacular. However, some things could have been left out with us getting the same amount of pertinent facts and the same understanding of what went on.If you're not a real history buff, you may the book to be a slow read. However, I mmay make my kids read the book as it is an excellent dramatic recreation of the events that took place in 1776 -- much better than any textbook could bring out."
5,We almost did not make it out of the womb!,"The author seems to have all the necessary facts, to say: this is what this one year of war was really like. If you want to guard against taking this country for granted, this book will do the job."
3,Interesting Historical Read,"The title is perfect because the author really stays focused on the events in the colonies and England in 1776. It is a good way to catch up if your early American history has slipped a little. I roughly new the story of the hardship of Washington and the other founders of America, but it was brought out so much more clearly by the author in this book. There were times when I was reading it wondering, ""hey, didn't the Americans win?"" Well that was how this book portrays Americas rocky start. It also highlights the important role that George Washington had in the founding of America."
4,good but a bit too much detail,"I thought this was a good book and it provides a very interesting history of the American Revolutionary war with a strong focus on the decisions and role of George Washington throughout the war. My only complaint is that it was a bit slow at times, becoming bogged down in details. however this is McCullogh's style."
5,WOW!,"David McCullough is simply the best historian writer out there. You never get a chance to be bored with the text due to his literary style which keeps the action moving even when events happened so long ago. He really makes you feel like you are there, watching out your window in the safety of your own home. By focusing on one year, the author gets to go in more detail of everything that happened with Washington and friends.... the only negative is that IT IS TOO SHORT! run, don't walk and get your copy."
3,Great for the general reader.,"I am an American Revolution fan. I've read about a dozen books on the subject so far. I read 'Washington's Crossing' by David Hackett Fisher before reading '1776'. Both books cover the same ground, but Fischer's book was so detailed and in-depth, I felt let down after reading '1776'.Like I wrote in my headline, '1776' is great for the general reader. It's a good introduction to the Battles of Brooklyn, Trenton and Princeton as well as Washington, Greene, Knox, the Howes, etc. After reading '1776', if you want to learn more about these battles and men, I highly recommend 'Washington's Crossing'."
3,Not Up To McCollough Standards,"I am a long-time admirer of David McCollough. However, I was dissapointed in 1776. Perhaps it is because the story is so familiar, but I thought the writing was rather ordinary - not at all like McCollough's other books. There was little presented that was particularly new or interesting to me, about either the politics of the time, the battles, or the personalities involved. The representations of the old battle maps (of Boston, New York, and Trenton/Prinston) are barely legible and of little use in trying to track the movements of the two Armys. The story follows the title, but it still left me feeling like I had not finished the book.Jack Bryan"
2,Very Simplistic,"I am big fan of the author but this book was a very simplistic look at the revolutionary war. I picked up the book hoping to gain a greater insight of the war and the occurences of 1776 but what I got was a very gloossed over version of the true events.If you want a basic explanation of the begining of the war, then this book is great. If you want something more detailed with ""a little more meat"" then I suggest you go somewhere else."
3,Needs maps!,"Slightly slower reading than I would have expected from this author...but that's the price to be paid for it's inclusion of so many original source items (quotes from soldiers writing home, etc.)The one big deficit was the lack of simple maps of Boston, NY and Princeton that would have clarified the three key battle areas discussed. It's truly amazing that the maps were not included."
4,"Great events, well told, small glaring flaw","A nicely told rendition of our nation's birth pangs, the human side of George Washington, and the desperate conditions the U.S. faced at its origins. What a shame this Pulitzer Prize winner from Simon & Schuster was marred by incompetent copy editing that confused principal with principle, lay with laid, and rein with reign."
5,1776,Can't review as I have not had time to read it yet.I gave it 5 stars because I know of past works by David McCullough. This should have a box asking if you have read it yet.
3,Manufacturing quality poor,The paper used in the book is different lengths. It is like the press forgot to trim it. I returned to Amazon but the replacement has the same problem.
2,Not as described...,"I bought this book which was supposed to be brand new. It was clearly not. The book comes in a cardboard case and the case was broken, which may not seem like a big deal but as this was the second one I ordered and both were broken it was rather irritating. I bought it as a gift for my brother. The only reason I did not return it was that he said he would keep it. Otherwise it would have gone straight back. Disappointing that the quality of the product did not meet the description."
5,Not only history but courage and dedication,"I have listening for this book on a CD for the last few weeks and learned not only about the history of the US, our nation, but about courage, dedication, and leadership. When at war, the winner is not always the one that is stronger or the entire population on side. It is not the one that win the first battle or the 2nd, has the proper ammunition and supply, but the one that believe in the cause and has the right leaders on their side. Few words about washington that was known to be the richest man in this side of the Atlantic, with 40000 Acres of land, 100 slaves and lots more. He had a lot to lose, yet, he volunteered more than seven years of his life."
4,Excellent Book,"Not going to go into a full review here... plenty of people here have said it just fine, so no need for that. What I would like to add is that this excellent book is even better when read by the author on audio book. I highly recommend that if you like audio books, you consider getting the audio book version of 1776. McCullough is an excellent reader.This book will show you just how close we came to losing our independence. It is filled with gripping tension, while at the same time having interspersed anecdotal humor. I enjoyed it very much one single very long road trip from southern California to Washington State, and it made an excellent companion for the road. It was hard to stop listening... not a single moment bored me. When I would stop for meals along the way, I could hardly wait to get back to it. Highly recommended."
5,Enjoyed the ride!,Mr. McCullough once again transports us back to the primordial soup of the United States. I felt as though I were part of Washington's officer class. I great read for all...
4,Where's 1777?,"This was my first McCullough book and honestly I thought it got off to a very slow start. But I soon found myself racing to the final sentence and enjoying every page. Unfortunately, the year 1776 had to come to an end (likewise the book) and I was wishing there was a ""1777"" follow-up. A great companion piece to ""1776"" is ""Citizen Washington"" by William Martin. ""Citizen Washington"" is historical fiction and in my opinion even better than ""1776"". Do yourself a favor and read them both."
3,Not his best work,"When compared with McCollough's other works, 1776 simply doesn't measure up. The detailed descriptions and insight delivered in ""The Johnstown Flood"", ""The Great Bridge"", and ""Path between the Seas"" is replaced with a rather cursory overview of the events of 1776. Some of the information in the book is insightful, but better insight into Washington can be found in ""His Excellency"".Overall, I'm a huge McCollough fan. I'm not a big fan of this particular book."
3,"Big name, weak book","I think McCullough's living on his reputation with this one. A good bit of information, but not a lot of sense of history or the events or the people. Whoever wrote this for him didn't do a great job. I read this after Ellis' American Creation and the contrast was shattering."
4,So well-written it's almost like a time machine,"This book reads like a page-turner novel even though it is meticulously researched. It is the best history of the first part of the American Revolution I've seen. It's the revolution ""up close and personal,"" and it brings into vivid reality how close we came to losing the war. The hardships that the American rebels endured to win are mind-numbing.The only reason for a four-star is that the title of the book is all-too-accurate: this is about the year 1776 only, and the book just stops abruptly in early 1777, after the end of the last campaign that began in 1776. It's as though McCullough decided, oh, that's enough for now."
4,McCullough Does Not Disappoint!,"This country needs more historians like David McCullough -- able to see multiple sides, good and bad, of the subjects of his histories, yet resisting the popular urge to let the ""downside"" erase everything good about the ""upside"". He is honest about the strengths and weaknesses in Washington, Greene, Knox, Reed and the other American patriots, as well as their British adversaries, and the story is so well told that it reads as easily as a novel. I had difficulty in envisioning the layout of the battles around New York, but not the least problem in understanding the feelings, experiences, thoughts, etc. of the soldiers involved, thanks to McCullough's excellent use of first-hand accounts, letters, etc. His incorporation of such things in the narrative is seamless! Another job well done!"
5,I didn't want it to end!,"When getting into the final pages of this book, I went backward and reread some of the earlier pages, I just didn't want to get to the end. I felt I'd gotten into the spirit & the feel of the times, & just a little bit into the minds of Washington & his closest associates in '76. My history classes had not gone into detail about the failures in the Continental army and the huge discouragements they encountered that would've made weaker minds give up. The interesting aspect, as well as the devil, of course, is in the details, & I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know why we have someone called a ""father of our country."" Thank you, David McCullough -- wish a 1777 were in work!"
5,Not only does it take you to 1776 ..,"I cannot overstate the magnificence of this book and the narration. The suspense leading up to the battle of New York was palpable. Not only do you feel you are there, but that it is happening now. The book gives the reader a deep appreciation of the price paid to secure our liberty and the character of the generals who led the struggle. Washington's perseverance through so many dark periods that would crush other leaders is inspiring. David McCullough's narration of this book should be required listening first in our high schools, then colleges and in our military and political institutions. It would emphasize the heritage we need to protect and not squander to self interest. Thank you David !"
4,a 1776 companion,"I recieved 1776: The Illustrated Edition as an unsolicited Christmas gift. A very welcome one at that (second only to Castle Grayskull as a child). This book provides an abridged text of McCullough's Pulitzer winning book 1776 with a vast collection of letters, paintings (including the staples by Peale & Trumbull), maps and other drawings to emphasize the story presented. It also includes reproductions (I believe to scale) of various letters, documents and maps which serve as an awesome hands-on bonus.To the avid history read I would recommend first reading the actual book and then turning your attention to this version as a supplement. Besides, the bulk of 1776: The Illustrated Edition does not make for the best reader.The downsides are few: bulk, abridged text and the packets containing the reproduction documents weren't designed very well making replacement a bit tricky without tearing the packets.This is a worthy purchase or gift for fans of American history."
5,Outstanding Research and Writing: A Great Book!,"David McCullough has done it again. A tough year for the rag tag colonial army, this is a story about the inspiration and determination of George Washington and the rising to the occasion of some of his officers and soldiers. Outgunned, outmanned in both army and naval prowess with very little military experience, they survived to fight another day. It is an incredible and almost unbelievable story. It set the foundational attitude of this great country that is now being picked apart by people who simply do not understand what took place: the founding and development of this country by a population of rugged individualists who learned to pull together. Today's politicians should read this book. I highly recommend it. It should be required reading for high school history classes."
5,Brings history to life,"From my experience, very rarely will a history book produce effects and feelings similarly found in movies or tv. Visual stimulation is usually high on the drama and theatrical effects, whereas books tend to be more detailed and historically accurate. But this account succeeds in both aspects.The characters jump off the pages and come to life. You get great insights into the way life was back then and how we managed to fight the war with a lack of experience, men, and arsenal. You get a great appreciation for what Americans (well not even Americans yet) went though. Men with very little military experience were asked to step up and lead a revolt against all odds.A well written, historically sound read with some parts, specifically some quotes, that were found in the Benjamin Franklin biography. All in all worth the time to read but if your not a die hard historian you may wait and see if comes out in paperback."
4,A great hook to reintroduce you to the War for Independence,"I'd read some Revolutionary War books before, but after hearing all the hype of 1776 I thought I'd give it a read. It was such a refreshing and new take on a war fought so long ago in a time so very different from our own. The author explains the roots of the war so the reader has a full knowledge of what spurned the movement for independence. I had never realized how reluctant yet dedicated a leader Washington was. I earned a new respect for this character that most now only associate with a $1 bill. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was that it ended too abruptly and left me wanting more! Thankfully, I found some other great books to see me through until the end.Rarely does a book live up to all the hype but this one clearly does."
1,Repetitive,"This book was about 200 pages too long, could have been written in about 100 pages. McCullough repeats himself multiple times concerning the disposition of General Washington's troops. Not very descriptive with the battles or the political atmosphere. McCullough get's caught up in mundane detail and returns several times to these descriptions. I was hoping McCullough's style to be similar to Stephen E. Ambrose ""Band of Brothers"" or James Bradley ""Flags Of Our Fathers"". Unfortunately I do not recommend."
1,Disappointed.,I was dying to get a copy of this book. When I finally got it I could not wait to dive in. I dove in and it was ok. I figured it just started slow and dry. I month or two later I tried it again from the beginning. I made it a few chapters farther. However I could not stay interested no matter how hard I tried. I have read history books and been captivated. I was never captivated. I feel really bad because I nagged my father in law for this book. I recently tried to pick up where I left off and was literally put to sleep. :-(
1,"Great story, told very poorly.","I know this guys is one of America's most important historians, but his writing style in this book is terrible. This is a very narrow shapshot of a very impotant moment in U.S. history, but it is told in a very disjointed and sketchy manner.He must have been rushed by the publisher."
1,1776,I read books a lot and for the life of me this book I could not wrap my brain around. I could not even read it without going back and checking correctly if I read the dates right. Its nearly impossible to read this book and actually comprehend. I don't mind history books but it should be called impossible to read.
1,"GREAT STORY, WRITTEN UNREADABLY","Shame ! A great story written so poorly as to be almost unreadable. The author writes full of himself as if he were adoringly listening to himself narrate some pretentious Ken Burns docudrama. Unfortunately a written work must stand on its own and justify itself. It can not be just a few scrambled words that would connect the ""thousand words of a photograph"". Read ""Washington's Crossing"""
5,Objective History in a format my teenagers both enjoy reading,"I read this book and then bought a copy to use as part of our U.S. history curriculum at home. Our two teenagers have been enjoying the book as it is well written and presents the historical facts in somewhat of a novel format. It is easy to read (he is telling a story) and FAR from the dry, sanitized information that tends to be the hallmark of many school textbooks. David McCullough is a very reputable historian and an excellent storyteller. If you are looking for a great read on Washington and some of the events surrounding our battle for independence and liberty then I highly recommend ""1776"" and pretty much anything else by McCullough.The only downside to the book is that it fell apart within the first week. The binding is terrible!"
4,Very readable,Excellent read about significant year in our history. Wish the pictures and maps could be integrated into the text of the book.
5,Incredible,"A must for American Revolutionary War fans. David McCullough does an excellent job in this work. He provides excerpts from letters, first-hand accounts by those present, as well as combining information from other sources. In the book he provides insights into the British thoughts and actions; and later the Hessians. The book did not focus entirely on Washington, but his surrounding officers and the soldiers as well. An awesome book which I'm sure to read again."
4,Great Book,I discovered how much suffering was envolved in our struggle for Independence and how many people in the colonies that did not want to break from England.
4,Entertaining and informative but not one of his best,"After reading this book I feel I learned a lot about George Washington's role in the American Revolution but as far as the edge of your seat storytelling skill McCullough is known for, I feel it was a bit slow. I enjoyed his perspective on the British loyalists and hardship those people went through and I think that subject is never discussed enough. The storylines of the American rag tag soldiers was interesting and at the conclusion of the book, McCullough credits Washington's motivation of the troops as the single biggest reason for the rebel success. McCullough does enough analysis of Washington's strengths and weaknessess to not feel like he is cheerleading. In summary, an entertaining book but not up to the standards of his other great biographies."
4,AP World History Review,"1776 by David McCullough is a fun and interesting read. McCullough brings the reader through the American Revolution from the beginings of 1776 and the procession of the King of England, showing how devote his countymen were to him. McCullough talks about the battles that all of us are familiar with, like the battles of Lexington and Concord, but he also talks about many battles that most Americans have never heard about. He talks about the Battle in New York City where the British drove out the American Revolutionary Amry.The book also follows the paths of King George III, General Howe, Henry Knox, and Nathanael Greene and their place in the American revolution.Overall it was a very good book and one that I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about the American Revolution."
4,High Quality Reprint,"A long awaited reprint well done. A good source for the region's families, but like any personal genealogical compilation, you must ""consider the sources."""
5,A great Kids CD that a parent can love too!,Kudos to Mr Ray and his new CD Start Dreaming. Of all the kids CDs I have this is my favorite. The music is sophisticated and Rays voice is very easy to listen to and the childrens voices add a nice touch. The music is very singable and the lyrics are very accessible to kids. Even after listening to it 25 times in a row I didn't mind hearing it again. In fact I don't know if I want to keep it with my kids music or my own! From animals to sports to rainbows to a lullaby this CD has something of interest to children everywhere. A must buy!
4,Quite enjoyable,"Once you have sampled every piece of fiction written by the Grandmaster, fan fiction is the ""fix"" of last resort ;-)Having said that, I recall being quite amused by this quirky collection of Asimovian stories. They stand on their own as being good science fiction.To make an analogy, I would compare this collection to the Star Wars: Tales series of comic books in the context of new fiction in relation to the canon."
4,Mixed Bag,"Most of the stories in this collection are not to the caliber of the good Doctor, however the Orson Scott Card is fantastic, well worth the price of the book"
4,"Not as good as Asimov, but a fun read","I enjoyed this book. I am a fan of the Foundation series of books, and I enjoy anything relating to them. These were pretty good."
3,"mostly good, but some really dull stories","I read this on a flight and ended up skipping several stories because they were so tedious and leaving the book on a recyle bin in O'Hare. The best one is ""The Originist"" which describes the start of the Second Foundation. ""Fall of Trantor"" and ""Strip Runner"" were also memorable because they consistently filled in a portion of the Foundation universe. Some stories were just plain silly, such as one where two robot meet with Asimov and argue to have the 3 laws ""repealed""."
3,The tittle is somewhat misleading,"[...] After reading the book, (BTW, I bought it nearly one year ago) I realized it doesn't provide detailed solutions that might help us do-it-yourself folks to prepare tax returns, if, for instance, you're a Security trader.The book, however, is a very good start where one may find a quite complete education on tax and estate planning, and where one may find further info. It provides many real life court cases, involving tax filings, with comments. [...] this is not a ""how-to"" book. For instance, it doesn't tell me how to complete Form 3115 line by line, rather it explains the purpose of the Form and the key points one must know about the Form.The number of issues covered in the book may be more than what one needs to know. All in all, it is a very good text for those who care to know more about their money and taxes, and the nasty surprises that IRS has in store for the unprepared."
3,Mulu - Filmstar,"Mulu's FILMSTAR gets a remix workout. Ism turn in two of them, with the ""Schizophrenic Banana Man"" mix going for a acid hip-hop line and the ""Mos Eisley Cantina"" mix going straight to the dancefloor, with some timestretched plaintive calls planted inside. Sonus abstracts the track into some IDM blips and breaks -- quite impressive, even if the vocals take a back seat to the electronics going on in the fore. Andy Gray takes the track into hardhouse territory. A solid effort."
4,Mulu - Filmstar,"On their FILMSTAR EP, Mulu offer two new tracks alongside the single. While ""Filmstar"" isn't the strongest track on the album, it does display a rock quality that makes it appealing. ""Devil's Torchlight,"" however, is a better track; it's a jazzy number, with torch song flourishes. ""Mrs. Fame"" is a lighter, acoustic guitar piece that brings to mind an Astrud Gilberto-type summery vibe. Nice."
4,Delightful Flavored Coffee,I love Coffee Masters Flavored Coffees. I usually buy organic coffee. Wish this was organic. Hard to find flavored organic.
5,3 words...BEST ANIME EVER,"Volume 2 is just as awesome as volume 1. Here we get more into the lives of the 5 girls, you just have to get this anime, its so beautiful!!!"
3,Interesting but Flawed,"This is a large coffee table sized book. You'll find more cooking tools and appliances than you ever dreamed existed. Yet it is flawed by the fact that not a hint of the relative cost of the items compared is provided. The publisher probably didn't want to date the book by providing actual prices but some mechanism should have been used to gauge the relative cost of items within a category. That's a major shortcoming! Still, it's an interesting book for hardcore cooks."
3,"Good, as far as it goes...","People who really love to cook and really love gadgets and cookware will enjoy this book. There is lots of interesting reading here. I had never heard of MANY of the items listed here, but then I'm not really a gourmet cook. I just like to own products that are the best quality I can get for the money I want to spend.There are no prices in the book, which I think is a drawback. Even if they become quickly outdated, it would be good to see which products are more expensive than others. Price categories would be helpful! Even ""Expensive"", ""Moderate"" and ""Inexpensive"" would be a good addition to this book!The other thing I'd like to see is a ranking of these products! They are all described and discussed, but there's no way of knowing which ones are the best. Consumers can make decisions for themselves as to which products are best for them for the money they want to spend.This is an interesting book, but it could've been better."
3,loud buzzing,"For some reason, this charger makes a loud buzzing sound when it's plugged in but no battery in the charger. I usually don't leave it plugged in when it's not in use so the sound isn't much of a problem. It charges and gets the job done!"
3,Big charger,This cheap charger seem to charge the battery fine. It is cheap looking and big in size. It works but there are better options out there.
1,very disappointed,"Could not believe I had just paid over 20 dollars for what amounted to a ""childrens book"" with only 25 pages of text. Your book descriptions should contain more info (age group, page count, intended audience, etc). I am very, very disappointed with you and have expressed my satisfaction with my co-workers."
2,Not for long time house or trance followers,"An album for the newbies. The tracks here have been played out to death a million times in a million mixes by a million other wannabe DJ's, both at a professional and amateur level. Children by Robert Miles, for instace is one such track. Another is Sandstorm by Darude. Yes they are good but, personally, I am bored to death of hearing them. If you have never been a follower of trance or prog. house music, you will definitely enjoy this collection of user-friendly tracks. However, if you find someone like Paul Oakenfold boring and are into something more diverse like Steve Lawler, Nick Warren, Digweed, deep dish, avoid this CD."
5,Farewell to a never ending piano legend!,"Simon Barere was one of the most formidable and amazing pianists ever lived. His astonishing technical equipment, his impressive phrasing and his winged fingering made of him a true living legend.Thanks to the actual technology, we have been able to rediscover and admire his supreme art. Once you listen him, you will be absolutely engaged.You' ve got my word."
3,"Different, but interesting","This book is definitely interesting. I haven't read a chick lit book written from a man's perspective. It is interesting to learn about how men think in regards to relationships. The book in general does't have too much substance. It jumps all over the place. At times when you get intrigued by a story in a chapter, it ends too quickly and is met with disappointment. I didn't quite love this book, but also didn't hate it. I would recommend it to those who want a quick read and be slightly amused."
3,.,"At first I was impressed with the book because of the range the author seemed to have...and then I kept reading...It's obvious the author based all the leads after himself. Although they had different stories and slightly different perspectives, their personalities were all about the same. What was worse, you can tell how clever and witty the author likes to think himself to be.....Which is a lot.Not a bad book, but nothing to praise."
4,Fantastic - even after two reads,"I first read this book in 2000. Just recently, read it again.It's a great read. Those with an imagination will enjoy this book. Anyone who wishes the church establishment could be knocked around a little . . . will love this book.Peter's simple faith and simple recollections of his time with his Master and priceless. I yearn for that simplicity.I've tried to located more info about Mark Bailey and haven't been successful. Aparently, this is his only published work. I wish I could find out more about Mark.Mark Bailey's writing reminds me of James Halperin's Truth Machine and Immortal Beloved. Great Reads! Thoses are the only two books he published as well.Thank you Mark for writing this book. Please write again!"
4,Very good book. Mystery. No religous thrust.,"The book was very good reading. An analogy may be Gerasic(sp?)Park with different main characters. Even though the book did not push religion, I couldn't help but feel that I learned a little about history. And although the book is fiction, some of the discussion lines made be think about whether there was some true religous philosophical reality to the story."
3,"Good characters, fascinating premise, flawed plot","This book had all the elements of an excellent novel, but fails to live up to its full potential. Two complaints...There are some big plot holes, like the scheming cardinal who spends many chapters trying to prevent the genetically ressurrrected Peter from meeting with the Pope. Then he suddenly arranges the meeting with no explaination!The author sets up a false tension where Peter keeps talking about how the Biblical accounts are ficticious, but every time he quotes events from his his experience he agrees with the Biblical accounts down to minute details.However, the premise and the characters are wonderful and the book is an okay read."
2,A good plot ruined by two flaws,"While this book has a good (though increasingly common today) plot and fairly interesting character development, it is nonetheless deeply flawed in two areas. First, the main premise, a bio-medical breakthrough, is neither well-explained nor at all reasonable. The idea of memory and personality transfer through DNA injection is just so far out it renders the rest of the book untenable. Second, bringing Saint Peter back as a New Age thinker and womanizer is not only ridiculous but an affront to anyone who puts even the slightest credence in the New Testament. While I enjoyed the drama and characters of Saint, these two major flaws made me wish I had not spent the time reading the book."
4,Good reading,"Well, this book is a good reading to anyone who enjoys science fiction. There is a part in which the book becomes slow, but afterwards you cannot stop reading it. I've never been to Italy and I thought the way The Vatican and Rome were vividly described was great (it seems that Mark B. spent some time there documenting the environment for this book). I also liked some questions that pop to one's mind in regards to the Catholic Church and the things they do. I guess that guiding souls and not wining them should be its goal (just as Mark says on his book). Overall: A good book."
2,Not for primary care,"I am a 3rd year family medicine resident. I thought that as a brand new edition, this would be an update to the 2003 version,Clinical Opthalmology: A Systematic Approach also by Kanski. I was sorely mistaken. Much different than a textbook that gives you clinical information such has diagnosis and management that you can use, this book is almost 100% nothing but pictures, a glorified atlas. It is utterly useless for primary care practitioners. I would not be so disappointed in this had it not been so similarly titled as the previous, excellent text I mentioned. For all those who are not practicing ophthalmologists, the older text is definitely recommended above this."
3,"And the Nominees are...... VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray, HD DVD. And the Oscar goes to... DVD?",Who doesn't love the Oscars altho this movie is watchable for all the stars it doesn't get any better then watching the 2008 Oscar presentations. Half hour after its over you forgot who was nominated and who won. Watchable just to see all the stars and how bad they can all be together in one movie.
1,VHS Movies-Poor Copies,Must be careful to get an original in good conduction to have some assurance it willbe watchable.VHS Tape quality was poor and not an original but a copy. Not a good buy at any price!SincerelyDissatisfied
5,Terrific thriller,"This terrific tale uses the maxim that absolute power corrupts absolutely even when caring people are involved to furbish the audience with a tense thriller. Readers will take immense delight in the story line in which the good guys (Delgado and the FBI) battles the bad guys (BISC) while the ugly (drug cartel) waits in the wings for round two. Though the romantic subplot between Elliot and Leah is distracting throw in, thriller fans will absolutely want to read Alexa Hunt's fine allegorical salute to the Patriot Act."
3,Crude but essential!,"A poor recording of a rare occasion that captures the expression of an era. GBO's talented musicians can be ""felt"" in the atmosphere of this essential album for any who appreciate GBO's music."
4,Sports Camera Review,"I completely disagree with the other reviewer. I think he was expecting WAY more from this camera and didnt understand its intended use.I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to get video to use on the internet. Granted, it is not going to give you good enought quality to make a wedding video and then make DVD's of that, but that's not really what it is made for.It works great for shooting outdoor sports such as mountain biking and skiing, etc. But the indoor use doesnt work very well.The external lens is also great, comes with a mount to put it on a bike helmet, and another one to put on your arm for snow boarding and such..."
1,Cheap Junk,"This camera sucks, I am a big fan of Samsung products, but this camera is a flat out waste of money. I bought this and returned it a day later. It is NOT Mac compatible as it states and the quality is pathetic. This could so easly break in your pocket. I bought Sanyo Xacti C40 and think that is ten times better, almost no comparison. The samsung takes decent pics and video, but is cheaply constructed. So if your lookin into buy this opt for the Sanyo or Fisher, won't regret it."
3,Fair,"I've had this camera for a year or so. I purchased an extra battery because the battery does not last very long. Like almost everyone else, the quality of the images is not as good as I thought and this camera really isn't worth the money. You can get just as good quality from a $120.00 camera. I wish I had known this sooner and I wouldn't have spent so much."
1,B&D CHT500,This product is a worthless piece of Junk. the battery lasts about long enough to run the blades until you try and start trimming. and the blades stall with contact of bush! I was able to use it one time. Very expensive useless trimmer.
5,Love the product,"But the picture showed two bottles and so I expected two bottles, not just one. The larger size is eaier to dispense than the half ounce size."
3,definitely won't last 400 shaves,"Mine lasted around 7-8 months, shaving every other day. This does not last 400 shaves as claimed. Great for frequent travellers. Saves some space. As for the quality of the shave, can't complain. Does as good a job as the standard gel shaving creams at a much higher cost."
4,Very good product,"The best I have tried for shaving oil. However, my order arrived and only one bottle was shipped, even though the image implies that the purchase is for two bottles. After looking at other products offered by Pacific Shaving Company, it seems that they frequently use misleading images (showing two items when the price is for only one). Not sure why they do that. Otherwise, a great product.I also agree with other reviewers that it probably won't last 400 shaves (from my experience, I would guess about 150), but it is great for travel and for being able to see what you are shaving."
2,Okay shave oil,"I have used plenty of shave oils in my career of shaving. From Art of Shaving to e-shave and plenty of others. Honestly this oil is not that special in my book. For the price, around 8 dollars it is the cheapest but I do not think it is up there on my list. The bottle says all you need is a few drops, bull. I put 4 to 5 drops and in no way was that enough, when I use this product I have to squirt a good amount on my face before I feel I have the right coverage. It even says you can use it by itself. No way! I have a sensitive face and my hair is thick so unless you are a teen with 10 whiskers on your chin there is no way you are going to shave comfortable with just this.On the positive, it is cheap and if you use enough it is effective. It also has a really good smell to it. I love this brand because they give back to the environment by planting trees for every purchase of their product but personally I need a pre shave oil that is more concentrated."
3,Get the michel thomas language builder not this,"I like the 8 hour course but it doesn't measure up to the usefulness of the 2 cd Michel Thomas Language Builder that is also availible. Language Builder is rapid fire, and it gives you more words. The 8 cd thing is slow and is good for more basic grammer. I can't imagine listening to the 8 hour course more than once. It's better than nothing, especially the last part of the last cd when Michel tells you to ""grab on to the handle!"".These 2 other people on the cd are not very fast learners, so you will find yourself trying to tell them the answer, as if they could hear you... so in summery, if you're anyone but a complete beginner you should get the language builder instead."
5,Amazing,I am 3 hours into this course and I felt compelled to write about the experience....As a victim of 1 years worth of high school French years ago all I will say is that I learned more in the first hour with Michel than I EVER did in school...Great fun and a real feeling of satisfaction!
5,excellent,"If you have an ear for language, this is the best way to learn a new language. I was able to engage in conversation almost immediately. The first couple of CDs are basic, very simple-- but the course builds quickly and you will be amazed at how much you learn in such a short time. I was completely satisfied."
5,on peut apprendre a parler franais très vite avec Michel Th,"I better learn a foreign language by writing or reading than by listening to a CD, or 8 CD's in this case. Normally it can be difficult to retain information just by hearing, and sometimes it could be frustrating. But since I bought this set of 8 CD's and listened to it anywhere, at home, in the car, I must say that it is a really funny, entertaining, dynamic way to learn, and can introduce you quickly to this language by building basic sentences, learning their logic, and comparing the big similarities between french and english. On these recordings Michel Thomas encourages you together with two students in a very funny but didactic way, to think, or to guess how a word or even a sentence in french can be, just by knowing its counterpart in english. I Speak a little english and german, and I must say that I never found a course so practical and fast, while easy to retain like this. Congratulation Monsieur Thomas, et 5 etoiles."
5,Amazing Prodigy,"I have to preface this review with the fact that C.H. is in fact my niece and, being family, I believed that her manuscript for The Book of Broken Hours would be good. I was prepared to tell her so in a supportive way that would encourage her to continue writing; however, her book was not good, it was surprisingly superb. She needed no encouragement from me since, at only 16 years of age, she had already produced an engaging piece of literature that could hold its own. C.H. demonstrates a command of English that would incite envy in a seasoned writer. The world she creates is complex, enticing, and fresh; a difficult achievement in the over-saturated realm of fantasy publications. C.H.'s eye is not set on the writing of her peers, but on the literary accomplishments of the great western writers such as J.R.R. Tolkien and, if this first work is any indication, there is reason to believe that she will one day join those ranks."
5,Old School Fun,"""Our Man in Washington"" is full of 1920s period flavor. The genesis of the novel - a meeting between writer James L. Cain and critic H.L. Mencken - is fictional, but Hoopes weaves together a believable and entertaining story. The sins of the Harding administration are resurrected and readers will identify comparisons to recent American history. Though the book is a bit talky with dialogue, it never bothered me as it full of smart quips from Mencken. There is no high octane suspense threatening Cain or Mencken, but their investigation is enough to support the narrative. Add in a search for the Hope Diamond and a two-man conflict over a beautiful woman. The difficulty with writing historical fiction is that the events are known -as in this plot - and Hoopes keeps readers engaged as the scandal is untangled. I enjoyed reading and re-reading this book as a break from the one sentence, character light thrillers that dominate the market."
1,This Router is Cheap and unreliable,Got it from Fry's here in the bay area for $29. Just keep loosing wireless connectivity. Not worth your time at all. Going back tomorrow. Pure junk.
1,Trash in a box!,"One of the biggest wastes of money and time. Bought one new, worked for one day then nothing...after many attempts to get it working I returned it."
1,"ABSOLUTE JUNK - NO STARS FOR YOU, D-LINK","Customer service, customer support, online support and setup are all lousy. This product is not worth the cardboard that it came in. All I wanted to do was change my SSID and after the 34th try it STILL wouldn't save my settings. My advice? Buy something else!"
1,Glutton for Punishment,"You would do the world a favor--if you EVER decided on purchasing this product--if you smashed the box to bits in the parking lot, turned around, walked BACK into the store, and bought a better 'effing router. Essentially then you spent the money on a broken box and still had to buy a new router, but that is the price for making a **stupid** purchase.I think i shall take my advice and do what i shoulda done a long time ago. It's what i get for making a stupid purchase."
1,Irritating Junk,"This router drops wireless connections at random intervals. Sometimes it's a few hours between dropped connections. Sometimes it happens every few minutes. Worse, the dropped connection lasts until you manually re-establish connection. So, you can't leave any kind of download by itself for any period of time, because the connection will simply be lost."
1,Avoid!!!,"If I had read reviews of this product before buying it, I would've saved myself a good couple of hours. It starts with unsecured wireless enabled, with easy default user and password, so be careful to secure it quickly. Also, if you disable the wireless, you have to do a factory reset to get it connected again. The default timeout for DHCP is too low, and there is apparently some sort of problem with a computer trying to refresh its IP (doesn't work, and seems to cause the router to reboot). The router will mysterious reboot for no reason with only one computer connected running virtually no load.The one redeeming factor of this router is that it can do whitelist MAC filtering which I wish the other vendors would do with their low end routers. Needless to say, this one was returned and RMA'd back to the manufacturer. I'm now trying out a Netgear."
1,Does Not work.,"I wish there was negative stars for this one. I would rate this -5 stars. As mentioned by poor souls in last few reviews this is completely useless router. It reboots, hangs, resets and any other unmentionable things a unstable hardware can dream of achieving. This router does so effortlessly.I relized few things though to help if you have the misfortune of having one.1) This router behaves a tad better with Comcast cable than SBC DSL with siemens.2) I could only use it reliable for few hours at streach after disabling wireless, plug and play and port forwarding feature.3) turn ot off every few hours and let it cool down.I ended up spending countless hours debugging it and trying to make it work. I ended by buying a Linksys and am much happier with that. My $.02"
2,I really wanted it to work,"I had hoped to join those who describe this thing as easy and fun, but I am on the other side.I spent hours trying to set up a network. The first thing you have to do is download a firmware update from what is humorously called a Support Page. The very best thing I can say about their support page is that it is a disorganized mess.At any rate, I finally hit a brick wall with an ""Internal Error"" message that came up during the setup process. Over and over. All it tells you is to shut down your computer and try again.After about 30 or 40 times, this gets old. I advise you to do as I did and return it, take the money and buy a LinkSys."
1,Pretty much worthless,"To be short and to the point:This router shuts off and resets itself at random times, without warning. This is especially annoying when you are trying to get something accomplished online.For the longest time, I wasn't able to change even the most basic settings, like making the router secured by a password or even changing the name of the connection.Please do not buy this router, go with a Linksys instead."
1,Buggy garbage,"What a terrible product. The setup ""wizard"" was completely broken, the clock kept resetting the date back to 2002 (despite correcting it multiple times), and it would only allow one wireless connection at a time -- when one computer connected, the other would get mysteriously disconnected. I wish I'd read the other reviews before buying ... this thing is going straight back to the store."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I bought this two weeks ago. I have constant problems with signal loss. The router needs to be rest about every 15 minutes. Their ""tech support"" is completely useless. Ihave spent a total og eight hours on the phone with these people in the last week. Nothing they advised worked and it actually seems to have made the problem worse. Plus, I waited on hold for an average of ten minutes and on one occasion the call was dropped after being on the phone with a ""priority specialist"" for 1/2 hour (and about 15 minutes on hold). The first question they ask your for is your phone number. If the call is dropped-they DO NOT call you back. Whatever you do-don't buy this ""product""."
1,Don't waste your money on this router!,"I purchased this product in early December 2007, the initial setup was easy enough but I was unable to create my own password leaving my network open for other's to use. My brother who is a computer whiz, solved that problem for me two weeks later(after a few hours and with the help of D-Link's website.) However it only worked for a few days afterwards, up to today no amounts of resets have worked.Steer clear of this product unless you want plenty of hassles."
1,Waste of time,"Bought this for a friend, spent two hours unsuccessfully trying to get it to connect to the Internet through their DSL modem. Tried a number of different things, went as far as downloading and upgrading the firmware -- no use. Brought it home, plugged it in place of my Linksys router (connected to the cable modem) -- same story. I can display the router's web configuration utility, but it just would not connect to the Internet. Should have spent $10 more on a Linksys product."
1,sucky little router with great potential,"THis router has great potential if it would only stay on. It reboots constantly when there is any kind of traffic (VOIP, Streaming music, etc.)My other Dlink did the same. No more Dlinks for me!"
2,Don't try to save $10-20 like I did,I had a Netgear router before this and I just replaced this one with Linksys. Both have been more reliable as far as speed and connectivity.
3,This router only worked for a few months.,"This router is very inexpensive and was easy to install on my Windows XP PC. The instructions were written in a clear manner and made it easy for me to set up my own password and networking controls. I loved the range of the router and how I had Internet access in my backyard by my pool. It was amazing, but the excitement was short lived. My router now only gives me access to the web in two rooms. I've tried reseting it and called D-Link for tech support. They did help me with many other previous issues, but once they told me to update the firmware, my router problems just got worse. My MacBook Pro never gets a signal and I've only had this router for two months. Spend your money on a better router! It will save you tons of headaches."
3,Not easy to change settings,"Installation went well. But when I change my wireless network settings, need to reset router and after that it works well. No issues so far.Friends are having negative feedback about this model, so far this is not applicable to me. let's see how long it will run"
1,piece of junk - poor customer service,"I bought this router and it worked well for 3 months. After that it stopped working and when I called tech support, I got someone who was completely incapable of helping me. After 2 months with no wireless internet and countless attempts at fixing the Dlink router, I went out and bought a link system router. Whats worse is ""D-Link does not offer refunds under any circumstances."" That is taken directly from their website. Don't buy this router or any other D-Link product for that matter."
1,Did not recieve item,I did not recieve the item I purchased so I don't have any nice things to say. I wish that Amazon or the seller would have communicated with each other so that this would not have happened. My money was taken and I did not recieve the product. Now I have to wait 2 weeks to get my money back after waiting 2 1/2 weeks to file the claim. The whole experience was unimaginable.
2,Buy this if you like being frustrated!,"I've had this router for just over a year and have never been overly impressed with its performance. It would work intermittantly but had to be reset all the time (sometimes every few minutes) just to keep it connected. The range is pretty good, but that doesn't matter if it's not sending a signal! Another note, their technical support is very poor and the web site is difficult to locate and/or use any information. Never could set up the security on the router, nor could I get understandable information on configuring the device properly. This week we bought a Lynksys router and it is performing much better (so far)!"
4,more than expected,"I seen a lot of negative comments on this router such as overheating etc..simply not true, give it space and it's fine, works great for me, works with my crappy BridgeMaxx internet service too.. this thing works fine good deal at $29.99 usd"
1,slows connection,"This router substantially slows my connection to the web. I've done numerous hard resets, installed the latest firmware etc... its just garbage."
1,I was bamboozled!!,"Just bought this trash and I can't believe I wasted my money. I had a Netgear wireless-g that was cheaper and had a wider range. It lasted about 2 years and I decided to try D-Link instead for the replacement, what a mistake. The auto setup does not work. I just configured manually.Not user-friendly at all. Could not access the setup with the default password. Then I called support and they insisted that I must have changed it. Then all of sudden the default password worked again.Their support people are not knowledgeable. Do not buy this product, not worth the money."
1,worse than garbage,"If you need to spend a lot of time to make a product work, then it does not work, period.This is worse than garbage, for garbage, I throw it away, but this thing wastes lot of time, before I throw it away."
1,Bad Product,"I brought this when I began my grad school last year. From the very first week, the device would simply stop broadcsting a signal, or not allow laptops to connect. When I called tech service, they asked me to remove the power and boot it back up. It worked, but that's not how I want mine to work. This happens once or twice every week and me or my roommates keep rebooting it. FInally, about four months ago, it gave up. Since it was in the warranty period, they exchanged it (shipping cost us $20). The new one is no better. It broadcasts the signal when it wants to and doesn't do as well when reboted as the earlier one, and because we are college students, we just need it for 5-6 hours when we are home.Based on the experience, and countless hours spent with tech service, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!. But a Motorola Wireless cable modem. I did and it works fine from day one, and it looks more robust mechanically than the D-link which feels like an empty plastic box (with a stick on it)."
1,Is this some kind of a joke?,"This router is horrible. It's a miracle I stayed connected long enough to be able to submit a review. I'm a computer novice so I can't get all technical. What I can say is that I am constantly losing internet connection. NOTHING works to resolve the problem. At best you can get it to work sporadically for a few hours with only a few dropped connections but then forget it. Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop drop. Drop. I'm literally throwing it out.PS - When I hit submit to preview this review it dropped again."
3,d-link router,product was ok but came with a defective ethernet cable so it took many more hours to install than expected. now it works fine.
3,Network gets disconnected needs a reboot at frequent intervals,This product is not recommended for online movie watchers or gamers. This router does need a reboot frequently as this stops transmitting signal wirelessly.
1,Flaky at best!,"I got this router for free with laptop purchase, and have had lots of issues with it since then. Firstly, my wife has a mac, and setting up this router using a mac is almost impossible! Secondly, ever since we set it up we are constantly having issues with no wireless router showing up and having to unplug it and replug it in inorder to reset (i didnt want to reset the whole system by pressing reset). DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS ROUTER!"
2,Crap product,"I absolutely do NOT recommend this to anybody who has just bought a ps3 or plans to do any sort of prolonged internet work. This router likes to cut you off the internet after apx 4 hours of usage. Almost as if it just decides to give up as if to say, ""You've had enough for today. I think I need a break.""I thought I was getting a deal when I bought this at $[...]. The cheap belkin router I bought for my mom at $[...] is more reliable. I'm personally going back to linksys because at least it worked for more than 4 hour increments.Piece of crap."
1,Frequent disconnections and faulty firmware,"As mentioned by many other reviewers, my wireless connection gets dropped all the time. At times, once very minute. I know that wireless connections can be shaky sometimes, but this was just ridiculous. Not only that, but it was really difficult setting up the router. Every time I tried to log onto the router, it would just bring me back to the original log on screen. At first I thought I was doing something wrong, but after reading several review sites, I realized it was a firmware problem where the settings would sometimes go to default or it was really difficult to log on. This was my first D-Link router. Previously only had Netgear routers and never had issues like this. Very disappointed."
5,Excellent LCD TV,"I recently upgraded to this 30 inch RCA LCD TV and I must say I'm very pleased with it. The picture quality is extremely good and the controls are very intuitive. The TV is also a beauty to look at. In looks and picture quality, it easily surprassed all the other brands that I looked at in the electronics store where I bought this from."
4,Pretty Decent,"I use this in place of my standard oven. It cooks very well, including the sensor cooking. I think the user interface could be made a little more sophisticated, but the simplicity may appeal to the average user more than a geek like me."
5,A great microwave,We have been using this microwave for 5 months. It's a great product.I would wholeheartedly recommend this without reservation to anyone looking for a highend microwave. This is also a convection which is handy.
1,very poor product,"I bought this product about 4 years ago and never used the convection, bake or broil controls. We mainly used this microwave for heating leftovers. First, my husband had a problem with the oven cutting off,but we were able to use for heating our food and beverages until I was heating my son's coffee and we heard a buzzing sound and smoke and burning smell. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I am very disappointed with Panasonic and will never buy any of their products again I rate this microwave oven a big fat 0. Buyer beware Too expensive and no quality."
2,broke after two years....,"This is a top-of-the-line microwave and It has served us well for over two years of normal family use, both for microwave as well as for convection oven cooking. Yesterday it greeted us in the morning with a distinct electronics-burnt smell when warming up milk... Our previous microwave /convection oven combination lasted for almost 10 years... Most disappointing from an expensive and supposedly reliable product like this... We are now looking into fixing it but keep this in mind when shedding big bucks for this item..."
1,Buyer Beware,"Bought this unit Feb.20,2008, worked great until April 19,2009. Amplifier died cost me $150.May 29,2009 Smoke and sparks everywhere. Called Panasonic. ""Send us the unit we want to look at it."" once they had it I couldn't get it back. ""We'll replace it!"" but not with the same unit I sent them but a lesser one. Now I'm out $750 and I have an unopened box I do not want and can't get hold of Silivia Ramirez in Coustomer Claims Dept. they don't return my calls.Bait and switch Con Game. Magnatron has Multiyear warranty they are not honoring."
4,panasonic microwave convection oven,"Panasonic NN-C994S Genius Prestige 1-1/2-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Convection Microwave Oven, Stainless: we liked this microwave convection oven, but we had to get a new one because the first one fritzed out after only 4 months; hopefully this new one will last a few years"
1,Now I have two bad units,"First one showed up. Door wouldn't open. Release mechanism was broken. An internet search shows I wasn't the only person with this problem. Amazon was great about arranging the return and delivering another. The old unit is packed and ready to go, but not yet dropped off at UPS, when the new unit arrives.New unit runs for three seconds then turns off. No matter what the setting or what is inside. New unit runs for three seconds then turns off.Now I have two bad units. There won't be a third, not with this brand, not with this manufacturer.I'm really bummed. I liked everything about it, other than the fact it won't work."
2,Under powered. Over priced,"I bought this last Christmas as a treat for myself when my old cheapo microwave had died. I bought this based on the glowing reviews on this site. My plan was to use it to replace my dead microwave as well as to retire my cheap toaster oven I had had for a few years.This oven is very big and *very* under powered. To give you an idea, tonight I cooked shake-n-bake pork chops. I doubled the cooking time on the box and the pork chops still came out pink / redish in the middle. They would not have been safe to eat after the recommended cooking time. Forget about cooking a small turkey or small roast.This box is only slightly better as a microwave oven, though at least it's usable. It's slightly less powerful than my old 4-year-old $99 microwave that it replaced.What a disappointment."
1,The worst software EVER!!!,"The Scanjet 4070 comes with the ""HP Image Zone"" software. For anyone that knows anything about scanning / image editing, this software is terrible. It does not allow you to do anything! Not only is it the worst imaging software I have EVER used, but when i researched it online, I found out that HP will not release the codes of the scanner to 3rd party developers, so I can't even use other software. HP makes decent hardware, but their software makes me want to throw the decent hardware out the window!!!"
2,not what I excepted,"I had no problem with the software. I bought it to scan a ton of photos into my computer, but at the rate it scans it will take me forever. Like other complaints, I previously had a HP scanner and could do batch scans. Not with this one. I can put 4 pictures on the screen, but each one has to be re-scanned. The scans do look good. but i guess I am in the market for a new scanner and this one will have to go to someone with lesser needs than myself."
2,Don't buy if you run Vista,"This scanner and software is fine if you only use XP, but I bought this 2 years ago, about the time Vista was coming out so I thought HP would make it compatible with Vista. No such luck, HP wrote the software for XP and then dumped support. They half attempted to write a driver for Vista but it is slow and you can't use HP software, so now I have to stay with XP. This will probably be my last HP purchase."
1,HP 4070 Scanner NOT Vista-Compatible,"I bought the HP 4070 Scanner and used it with Windows XP for a couple years. Last Christmas, I bought a new laptop with Vista Home installed, and HP had no Vista driver available for the 4070. I did a lot of searching on HP's web site, and subscribed to their tech newsletters, but never found any solution. After several months, HP provided a ""minimal driver"", but it would not work with HP's scan software, so the front panel buttons to scan to printer, etc. would not work. My solution has been to keep my old desktop with XP for the sole purpose of scanning. HP orphaned this scanner. Their ""solution"" is for you to buy another scanner. Guess what, I'm not going to buy HP again. I can't believe HP is still selling the 4070 and not supporting it with a full Vista driver."
2,Scanjet 4070,"I bought this item because the resolution was 2400 dpi and I could scan multiple pictures at once, and the software would separate them into separate pictures. After I bought this the scanner would not separate the pictures at a resolution above 600 dpi. After several days of back and forth with HP tech support. They finally tell me that this scanner can't separate the picturesabove 600 DPI. Then they tell me that you can't tell the difference between an image scanned at 300 DPI and one at 2400 DPI.P.S. That business of ""scanning a stack of Pictures"" means you lift the lid put a stack of pictures in the holder close the lid, scan it, open the lid, remove first picture, close it, scan it etc."
1,Elegant hardware. Awful software for slide scanning.,"Like a previous user, I purchased this scanner for scanning slides. I only tested it's slide scanning capabilities.If you do not intend to scan slides, then this review may not apply to you.The software makes the scans take forever to do, at 200 DPI ! Push the button and 60 to 90 seconds later, it starts the scan. If you immediately press the button again after that scan, it still takes 60 to 90 seconds to start the new scan. It acts as if it has to wait for the bulb to warm up. The bulb is already warm! The software really restricts you, and it does not work the way you think it should.This scanner may be fine for scanning other items than slides, but for scanning many slides, forget it.If HP rewrites the software, this would be a really nice scanner. With the present software, it is really bad for scanning slides.Windows XP home edition.You must download a patch from HP to install the software. Even on HP computers!"
3,"Good Scanner, Bad Software","I have been using the scanner a couple of weeks now. I have only used it to scan documents and photos, not slides or anything fancy. The quality of the scans is pretty good actually, never the less the software really, really, stinks.I'm using photoshop now to scan the images and i'm fine that way.I would give it 5 stars if it had good software. Everything else is very good, nice price and everything.If you plan on using third party software to scan, go for it. If not, well...."
2,Easy to Use?,"We purchased the HP 4070 as a Christmas gift based on the ""easy to use"" descriptions.After two plus hours of trying to get the software installed on a Windows 2000 PIII 800MHz w/ 256MB RAM, we were not able to get the software and scanner to fully work together.We then tried a second PC, a Windows 2000, dual PIII 800MHz w/ 512MB RAM. After 30 minutes, we were able to successfully install and use on the second machine.The scanned images were decent, but not worth the time it took to scan nor the complexity of using the software. So we returned the scanner. HP, is this your definition of Easy to Use?Using the HP 4070 felt like interacting with the airlines - ridiculously painful."
3,Might be good if I could get it working,"Received scanner in record time from Amazon. Only one day after shipping via Brown Ground. After 2 hours of trying to install the software I had to call HP support in India or Pakistan or where ever. After another hour on the phone (with a very nice lady) I was told the install software v4.01 was corrupt and they are sending me another CD free in 5 - 7 working days. If I wanted it sooner I would have to pay. After paying for the scanner I am really ticked off that HP would not expedite the replacement CD (which has no guarantee it will work) for free. So here the scanner sits on my desk like a lead weight. It's totally useless at this point. Perhaps in a week or to if the thing ever works I can send a better review. Oh yea, I downloaded the drivers and all from the HP site and it did not work either. I am using Windows XP Professional edition with more computer power than the scanner says it needs..........."
4,If You missed your chance..,"For everyone who missed their chance in buying the ""1332"" album..Here it is. It features every track from the previous album along with some live tracks and demos. This may not be my favorite band from Boston, but they are certainly worth listening to, and seeing as how hard their stuff is to find..buy it before it goes out of print again."
3,"Good Amp, Doesn't fit standard rack.","I bought this amp a while ago and It has been a good amp. I have driven 2x DJL103E's, which sounds great with this amp. I have also used it to drive 2x Peavey 1210TS speakers with enough power to make them move across the floor. The problems came when I went to mount it into my rack. It appeared to be a 2u amp but it actually measures about 2.25u and the holes are not properly placed or spaced. If you plan on rack mounting this ""rack mountable"" I would suggest you stay away. Now I have to buy a bigger rack, or a different amp."
2,"Not the right aerator for Carolina Clay, and Missing Pieces","Ordered this to tow behind my riding mower and was disappointed on two major counts:1) Missing parts and stripped bolts. Proper assembly could not be fully completed due to a missing hitch plate and a poorly threaded bolt that could not be used. I managed to improvise, but sending the correct parts and a couple of extra nuts and bolts should be a minimum requirement.2) I live in the Carolinas and the soil is too hard for this aerator. I added over 50 pounds of weight to the top of it but had minimal ground penetration. It might work on softer soil, but doesn't do much for Carolina clay."
3,So cute,"I love the look of this, BUT the bottom has rusted and left a stain. Bar Keepers Friend cleans the stain, but still it's a pain. I finally put an old rag under it."
5,chocolate milk?,"my son loves chocolate milk so I bought him the american version of malt chocolate ovaltine thinking 'at least he'll get some vitamins w/ this'. but he also gets a LOT of sugar with it. So, I just made the switch to the european brand b/c it has way less sugar. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a chocolate flavor, but I I started mixing it in w/ his American malt chocolate ovaltine and now he drinks the european one straight without even noticing the flavor difference. And believe me, there is a huge flavor difference. My husband is repulsed by this european brand which tastes like brewers yeast and barley, but my son thinks he's getting a special treat! I personally enjoy the flavor."
4,Does he beat ya girl?,"I saw this movie way back in 1989. I think it is quite funny, in a Vegas in Space/ Female Trouble sort of way. It has one of the best lines in a movie that i have ever heard... ""Does he beat ya? Does he beat ya girl? You got burned if he don't beat ya girl!"""
2,Defective,"The design of this propane stove is nice, but after a single use, the propane regulator on the stove didn't work. That left us with five camping days left to go and no way to cook. I'm pretty disappointed as Coleman has a good reputation."
4,Does the job,"Overall: This is a good stove for car camping or outdoor cooking.Positives:- Set up and operation is easy- Burners can put out a huge or tiny amount of heat as needed; controls are excellent.- Fuel is inexpensive and readily availableNegatives:- The stove should have rubber leveling feet for safe use on non-flat surfaces.- Pushing the igniter pushes the stove. Again, it needs rubber feet.Troubleshooting:A common problem with the spark lighter is that the sparker is slightly misaligned. To fix, bend the sparker a little bit so the spark was in the right spot relative to the burner."
5,A very nice stove at a good price,Lights easily and the burners are powerful and consistent. Not much more you can ask for from a camp stove.
3,Stove Review,"Stove unlike our tent, performed pretty good. It heats VERY quick and we are happy we went with this model-lots of hot water quickly which is what we wanted-even boiled a large pot fast for corn on the cob!The only problem we had is when the burners get wet from rain, the auto-lighter doesn't work. Lighting manually with a lighter results in burnt fingers due to layout but otherwise, a great product and one we would recommend."
3,self starting doesn't work,"Nice looking stove and cooks quickly, but the InstaStart hasn't worked for me once. Not a big deal, because I'm used to starting my camping stove with a match, but I'm disappointed because I thought that it would be a cool feature."
1,Third and last try being returned,"As of today, I will have ordered and returned three of these stoves, all of which were defective out of the box. The first had a warped grate or stove top (not sure which), which prevented the grate from sitting firmly in place (it wobbled like a table with a short leg). The second and third both had deformed bases (stamped metal that wasn't stamped properly) and so did not match up with either the stove top or the lid, leaving open holes and jagged edges along what should have been a snug seam. If I were Coleman, I'd be pressing my Chinese suppliers for compensation for the consistently shoddy manufacture/assembly of one of my core products. I will look for something else at this point."
