3,Okay.,The book is a great story but its is a little all over the place. But all in all it is a great book.
3,Good book but a little far fetched,"Good book but a little far fetched... Entertaining though and a fast read. It kept my attention, but it would just have someone die an unexplainable death or claim a strange magic randomly."
5,Like Water for Chocolate,This is a beautiful book; even more so than the movie. Magical realism along the lines of Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Isabelle Allende.
4,tastes from another world,"I liked this book! It was filled with emotions, you could taste, smell, feel and see the characters lives unfolding. I liked the magical touch too. If you liked this book you might also enjoy "" The Mistress of Spices"""
3,Irritated Listener(Audio Book),"Enjoyed the story, (should have given it a five rating.)However, I found it VERY irritating to have to listen to a reading of many, many recipes. Recipes should have been referenced to the back of the book for those readers who were interested."
4,Wow! This book made me laugh and cry and hungry!,"This was a great book, more sophisticated than a fairy tale and yet it still maintains that air of simplistic innocence. It's richly textured in imagery and irony, and all the bad guys get theirs in the end. What a work of art, a literal feast for the senses."
4,Like Water for Chocolate Review,I recently read this for my Modren Lit class. This book is a middle school to a high school level. Some people might think that this book is for girl. I think it is for both man and woman because man can learn how to cook.For woman they can get recipes.In the book there is a close relationship between Tian and Nacha the cook. There relationship is like mother and daughter. There relationship is so close because Tita was born in the kitchen. Tita spend all the time in the kitchen. That is why Tita and Nacha had a close relationship.Also in the book there is a tradition that mother makes her follow. That tradition goes that the youngest chidren has to take care of there mother intel she dies. She can get married.I would recommend this book to people who like to read romances book.
3,HEARTACHES AND STRONG EMOTIONAL FEELINGS,"LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE was about a woman, Tita, who faced many challenges and struggles from childhood through adult life. Overall, we all liked the novel because it is related to real life situations. For example daily life relationship between parents and teenager life stituations."
3,A Mexican love story that opens your instincts for good food,"The book is a story of love, suffering, tradition and food that involves an old fashioned family from Mexico in the early 1800s, all the characters play an important part in this story, but the principal role is about Tita, a sad young girl who was born in the kitchen table, and that was the place where she spent almost all her time, She learned to cook almost everything there, The kitchen was her confident in sadness, happiness, etc.About love she was an unlucky person, because the imposition from her mother of their family tradition, that was about of the smallest daughter to take care of the mother until the dead.The novel was written in monthly installments; twelve in total with home remedies and wonderful food recipes that I know you will want to try.I encourage you in to read this book, because you will feel a great necessity in to continue while you are reading, and finish it with the same emotion until the end."
5,Great Book-A Real Page Turner,I love the way this book used the recipes at the beginning of each chapter and the story was great. I read this book in one day and immediately went to rent the video. I highly recommend reading this book.
2,I can let this one go,"Remembering the hype/publicity surrounding this book when it was new, I found a used copy at a thrift store, stored it on a shelf until now. Read it in three sittings, but not because it was riveting. I will give it away to anyone who hasn't read it and would like to. Too much fantasy for this reviewer, recipes notwithstanding."
3,"Good book, took a while to get into","I like a book that grabs me immediately, or by the end of the first chapter, so I struggled to get started, but once I got there, I was hooked."
4,Great,"okk so the book itself is wonderful, but there is some higlighting done inside that is somewhat distracting but overall i loved the price and everything about this book"
2,"A View on Family and Love, Provocative but Empty","I had to put my two cents in. ""Like Water For Chocolate"" is an intersting take on a small town Mexican family. The mysterious happenings that occur to Tita (the main character) are the best parts, from her magic food and strange attachment to her sister-in-laws children. However, the book lacks feeling and surprise. The plot is predicatable, as are the characters. Another downfall is the deaths of the characters who need to be eliminated. This happens when it is needed most- an unrealistic convience. A book worth looking into if you're one for predictable Mexican soap-operas."
1,Would not waste time,I could barely get through this book. The descriptions were great but did not vCare for all the supernatural part of it. Would not recommend
1,Anti-Feminist,"Like Water for Chocolate was an assigned reading for my English class. When reading it at first, it seemed like a good book-- definitely an easy read. As the book picks up, however, it becomes totally obvious that these women feel worthless without a man. All of the women's problems in the novel have to do with men or lack thereof. Tita is spineless as a protagonist, and Pedro is just as spineless as her love interest. Also, the novel is supposedly set in the Mexican Revolution, yet there are, at most, three or four references to this in the entire book. They say how there is starvation going on, yet Tita's family has enough food that she is constantly cooking. If you are looking for an easy read and choose not to take this book for more than surface value, then go for it. But if you're looking for anything that will make you think, Like Water for Chocolate is definitely not for you."
1,like wasting my time for nothing,"This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed. Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic. The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Quirky but fun all the same,"A delightful little book, Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate is almost a modern-day fairy tale. Told in monthly installments, the novel is simultaneously story and cookbook, filled with both recipes and home remedies and as well as the story of Tita, our heroine, who was born, raised and taught in the kitchen, and who has the amazing ability to cook her emotions into her marvelous recipes. Tita's story is one of longing, love and the need to be her own person; to escape the tyrannical presence of her mother and create her own life with the man she loves. It's a relatively fast read, but enjoyable all the same."
3,"Creative piece of writing, but even all the cooking and...","...underlying ""erotic"" motives could not keep me interested throughout the whole book. I value author's creative writing style and I value this book as a good piece of magical realism, but....It lacks telling a truly interesting story. It is only interesting, if you want to know something about Mexican household life, told, again, from a MAGICAL perspective; otherwise, there is nothing ""magical"" about this book, otherwise, it is just that: a ""recipe book in monthly installments"". Plus, endless cooking and recipes just irritated my stomach, so I did not find it romantic at all (as it is supposed to be). Then, again, TASTES DIFFER (no pan intended), but MAKE SURE that you either HAVE A FULL FRIDGE or that you are (luckily) skinny. FOR THOSE READERS, WHO DO NEED TO lose some weight: first, finish reading this book and then, and ONLY THEN, go on a diet, to save yourselves double effort!"
5,true love will rise above,"When I first read this book I cried after the first chapter. This is a story about a young girl who finds true love and is force to give it up because of some out-date family tradition, but in the end her true love come back to her with the passion of ten thousand lost souls. This is a great story that anyone who lost their first love or anyone that you cared for deeply can and will related to. You will feel all Tita heartache,lonliness,and pain. You will never put it down. I know I read it three time back to back."
4,Like Water For Chocolate,"Laura Esquirel's ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is a beautifully written story of a young Mexican woman's struggles. Tita is severely oppressed by a domineering mother who bars her from true love. The combination of sensuality and the culinary arts allows for an abstract plot that leaves the reader guessing. This novel is not only uplifting but restores faith to any hopeless romantic.As a student of Mercy High School, I read ""Like Water for Chocolate"" for my English class. The novel's light plot provided for a fun and enjoyable assignment. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Fantasy-Reality it's all the same.,"The combination of Mexican soul food and magical realism creates a wonderful experience that would touch any person's heart. Tita De La Garza, the main character of the novel, takes the reader on an emotional roller-coaster as she suffers through life with her overly protective an strict mother, and the marriage of her soul mate, Pedro, to her sister. Each chapter begins with a new month, though the time span of the book is throughout her life, and a new recipe that will somehow tie into that chapter. I especially enjoy this book because of how Laura Esquivel gives it a sense of randomness by giving every day happenings a fantasy like twist to them. I highly recommend this book to someone who would want an easy read or just want to add a little spice to their life, with the steamy scenes Esquivel adds between characters. I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did."
3,Stranger than fiction should be,"I would have enjoyed Like Water for Chocolate, if it weren't for the magical realism. Unfortunately, strange things occured quite often in this book. What started out as what seemed to be a normal love story grew into a bizarre love-triangle, mixed with sex and food. I also was a little disappointed with the ending; I felt that the main character made a terrible mistake. I would recommend this book for anyone who would like an easy read and enjoys the idea of magical realism, which some might find entertaining, but that I personally do not."
2,mystical realism,"I will have to admit that I could not put the book down at first. The tragic love story stuff I can get into, but the mystical realism i can not. Born on a flood of tears.....her tears spoiling the food.......the room glowing from the passionate love-making......and the rest of that crazy jazz started to annoy me. Of course i finished the book, but when Tita didn't marry the doctor, I was turned off. Sorry Laura Esquivel, I guess I am a realist."
5,"Wonderfully written! Star crossed lovers, mysticism & life","All the members of ITCOMS were mesmerized by the lyrical writing style. We all loved the book. A member expressed ""you did not tell me the book was borderline erotica"". The symbolism (Tita having milk in her breast) and mysticism (Tita's emotions going into the foods, Nacha and John's grandmother) thread throughout the novel was spectacular. Mama Elena was abusive and controlling even after death. She apparently never got over her own ill fated love with the mulatto. The family tradition of the youngest daughter taking care of the mother until the day she dies reminded all of us of ""how far"" we have strayed from those traditions of the 40's and 50's in our own families. Wonderfully written. Like water for chocolate Tita's and Pedro's love was always on simmer until it boiled over."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"""Like Water for Chocolate"" was a great read! The characters like Tita, Pedro, and her wild sister Gertrudis will haunt your mind long after you've finished the book. What I liked most was the mixing of cooking, love and erotica. What I disliked about the book was how at times, the language seemed straight out of a soap opera. But there is not one instant where the plot lost my interest. If you read it you will not regret it!"
5,The forbidden love between two lovers.,"Have you ever wondered how would it feel like notgetting married to the one you're madly in love with? Well, it happened to Tita in this thrilling novel. Tita brought up to be carrying a family tradition. She was forbidden to get married for she had to take care of her mother until the day she passed away. The story went on with great conflicts and struggles to this dramatic charade. At the same time, comes along with great surprises of cooking recipes that have been passed on from generation to generation. This is also one of the reasons why this novel is so unique in which it's different from any others. It's a must read novel and I would recommend it to everyone out there!"
4,Like water for chocolate...,A very fun and funny read (in a good way). I've enjoyed talking about it with the girls.
4,Like water for chocolate,I thought that this book was great. I loved it because the book related to my life itself and the book and I have many dilemmas in common. I would recomend this book to anyone that is intested in romance and love affairs. This book is so well written that at times I thought that I to was a part of the book.
3,Like water for chocolate,"Like water for chocolate is a twisted love tail. From the view of Tita a girl destined to look after her mother until her mother dies. Tita falls in love with a man she is forbiben to love. Each chapter is a representation of a month, and a new recipe is cooked,each month. As Tita's emotions run wild so does the emotions of each person who eats her food. As her love for Pedro grows stronger with each day she can not stand the momories of him. A mishap brings tita back to the ranch and closer to her true love. Promises are made and broken and so are hearts. This is one of my all time favourite books, once i picked it up i could not put it down. This book also comes in a movie although it is subtitled the story is very intriguing. On a scale of one to ten i would give this book about an eight. I feel this story would appeal to 15 - 50 year old people."
4,There still is hope,"The receipts weren't my main interest in reading the book, and I found them nice to read, but difficult to put into practice. I've read better books of this kind (and I can't stop mentioning Isabel Allende's ""Afrodita"" which is a genuine art-piece) but it was a good read and full of optimism (after all!). Interesting the idea that the cook's feelings influence the meal :-)"
5,just a feel good book,The title of my review may be misleading. I think this book has an unexpected ending but leaves the reader satisfied-or it at least left me satisfied.
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"I purchased this for a college class. It was shipped on time and arrived in perfect condition. However, I did not enjoy reading this book. A little too strange for my tastes. If you are into magical realism and romance smashed together then this is the book for you. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."
3,Just like the movie!,"I adored the movie and went out the very next day to find the book, hoping for a deeper perspective on the characters. I was disappointed and surprised to find that it was quite exactly like the screenplay. That makes the screenplay extraordinarily excellent, I suppose, rather than compromising the quality of the book, but if you've already seen the movie, I wouldn't hope for much more in the book. If you haven't seen the movie, by all means read the book: it's sexy, spirited, sensual and moving. *THEN,* for SURE go rent the movie. The subtitles are more than worth the trouble."
3,Bittersweet!,"The passion and yearning builds with every recipe, yet just when you think you're going to have a bite of that delicious chocolate Esquivel talks about, it's taken away from you. Basically, the story grows and grows until Tita and Pedro are old and their lives are behind them. I couldn't have imagined a more unsatisfactory ending."
2,In love and confused,"This love story came out from a sight, grew up with contradictions and ended with sadness and sorrow.It's a real love story with bad side effects especially the end of it which was painful.The narrator was a character's daughter and the ideas belonged to the author.My opinion is that this story has a direct relation with the author's past and traditions according to the Place where it happened {Mexico in the late 1800}.Personally I liked this story with it's special way of narration and it's specific style made of imagination despite the sad end which I didn't care for.It would be better if Tita had married DR Brown.I will recommend this book to every one who likes a cocktail of love, sex, imagination and suspense."
2,Wonderful Book,Letitia Mikel-4bThis was a great book and I would recommend it to peole how really like love stories and also to people who like to cook. This book opened my eyes to a hole new world of books in which I mean that it let me knoew that love stories don't just have to be just about love it that they can also be about a combonation of other things and still be just as wonderful as a plain love story.
1,"nothing new, boring plot","It's a pity such a horrible book has received such good critics. I think what happens on it is somewhat ludicrous. The psychology of the characters is completely unbelievable; they do things one could never have expected from them and yet you can guess the plot before having finished the first chapter. It's boring, it tells you too much about cooking and nothing interesting happens on it. Isabel Allende's novel, The house of the spirits, is in a way similar to this book, but it has nothing to do with it because hers is really great, the characters are well-made and the plot is fascinating."
1,Actually i'd rather give this piece of crap zero stars.,"this book is too graphic. and the begining is so confusing. there's too many characters. and does the author reallly expect us to, after reading this stupid book, make a friggin quail in rose petal sauce. first of all i don't believe in eating animals that represent pets and second of all, i don't eat flowers. and do we really want to hear about her nipples hardening in the cold shower. no not really. and lastly i don't think this book is worth ten dollars and while borrowing this piece of trash, i lost it while taking the stupid STAR test and i now owe my teacher ten dollars, or a new book. and another thing: why would any sane woman let a dirty pigeon poop all over her, or eat candles and blow up with her boy friend stupid people."
1,Like Water For Reading,"I did not like this book at all. It was entirely too mushy. I cannot believe that this is a woman lib book. I felt like yelling at the main character. I HATED the way she kept throwing herself at her sister's husband. He was a creep, she should have stayed with the doctor. I guess it's not that bad of a book, if your into mushy stuff, but that ending stunk. Sorry, just my opinion."
1,What on earth!!!,"Im sorry to all you feminists that are in love with this book. I am 16 and I was forced to read this book for school, by my more than likely feminist teacher, and it was insane! All you women like it because it showed some chicks emotions in her food. Come on, Mama Elena comes back from the dead when Tita makes Ox soup? The ending was the worst, A: you couldent follow what the hell was going on, B: her quilt turns into a volcano burning up the entire farm, and C: WHO ON EARTH DIES WHILE HAVING PASSONATE SEX?!?! This book was a total waste of my time, thank God Laura Esquivel didnt decide to make this book 1000 pages long. The only quality of this book was length, nice and short."
1,brainless and simple,"it seems to me that the autor is trying to copy marquez's brilliant style, trying to write a visionary story about love and life.but it takes more talent, more phantasy, more ingenuity and much more vocabulary than maybe the 500 words used in this book to achieve this.sorry, but i cannot agree with all the other reviews, except maybe the recepies, this book is completely useless, simple and brainless."
2,Cold Turkey,"Magical Realism. It's a peculiar literary genre that our book club seemingly likes to include in our book bucket------we have read three others: Senior Vivo, The Cave, and One Hundred Years of Solitude-----but, ultimately, not one that we particularly enjoy. Like Water for Chocolate was no exception. While some of our sixteen reviewers did appreciate the author's attempt at cooking up hot passions, most felt that what we got was a contrived recipe for so much cold turkey."
3,Heart-Stirring,"Interesting style that's very unique.. what with the recipes and remedies!Unrealistic mystical tale is not really my taste. But this tale is one of a kind. The abstracts of the soul, passion, and love are cleverly described through the recipes, remedies, and the love story.. in ways that stir your heart.I guess I just love Esquivel's ""Swift as Desire"" a lot more."
4,Like Water for Chocolate,An execellent read. A truly disfuntional family protrayed through a labryth of love and hate and the notion of eternal love. A beautiful love story.I enjoyed the recipes and even made the oxtail soup. A old family favorite I had forgotten.
2,Written like a screenwriter would write a book,"Once I read the description on the author, about how she's a screenwriter, it all makes sense. I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical. It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else. There's no poetry to the writing.Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting. Maybe I'm too much of a realist and enjoy nonfiction too much, but this story just was not for me."
5,water for chocolate,"The book, Like Water for Chocolate, was a very interesting book. Sometimes it was a little boring but most of the time it was suspenseful. The part that was the most exiting for me was when Tina and her sister were having an argument in the kitchen. Another part that I liked was when Tina told John that she was cheating on him. I recommend this book because it keeps you guessing a lot and you will be on the edge of your seat till the end of the book. You should really go out and get this book."
3,Not sure what the hype is about,"My distaste for the magical realism genre certainly colors my view of Esquivel's novel. Still, there are glaring weaknesses that also contribute to my lukewarm 3-star rating. The allegory and symbolism are so forced and awkwardly integrated that I started out rolling my eyes and ended up having to force myself not to skip entire paragraphs. In addition, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped. For example, the love Tita feels for Pedro becomes revolting to the reader; how could she continue to love such a horrible, cowardly cad? Finally, the transitions are so untended that, toward the end, the chronology becomes incredibly confusing, leading up to an ending I can only describe as tacked-on and cute-sy. On the other hand, for those who like reading location-specific novels while traveling, the novel makes for a pleasant, quick and mindless read on the beach in Mexico. That's exactly what I purchased it for, so it served its purpose."
2,To each their own...,"I picked this book up for free at an orchard, they have a great book give away system. I had heard of this before but never read it. It was okay, but I'm sure I'll never read it again. The story is about 3 sisters and their mom on a ranch is Mexico. The older sister marries the younger one's love, and the story takes off. The problem is, I didn't connect with any of these characters. They story would have grim reality, then fantasy in the next paragraph. I can undrestand why some people would enjoy this, but it's not my thing. I think this is one of those books that you'll love or hate. If you love this book, you'll be shaking your head and wondering what's wrong with me that I didn't like it. If you didn't care for it, you'll understand what I'm saying. Whatever, to each their own."
4,A Fantasy / Love Story / Cookbook,"""Like Water for Chocolate"" is a fun book that mixes fantasy story-telling with a love story -- and throws in an authentic Mexican recipe with each chapter! It's a little bizarre, but it's just a lot of fun to read and the recipes look delicious.The story is about a Mexican girl who has been told that since she is her mother's youngest daughter, she can never marry. She must take care of her mother until her mother dies. As a result, she spends most of her time growing up in the kitchen and becomes a magnificent cook.As fate would have it, she meets a young man and falls in love. When the young man (Pedro) asks for her hand in marriage, he's told that Tita cannot marry but he can marry her sister. Pedro does just that in order to stay close to Tita. This love affair lasts throughout their lives.Highly recommended. This classic can be read in 1 day."
4,Delicious and Magical,"I devoured Laura Esquirel's novel Like Water for Chocolate--a love song to food. Mouth watering and spell binding, this novel worked it's magic on me and I just could not put it down.Tita is the youngest daughter and according to tradition, must stay with and care for her abusive mother. Fighting against her fate, Tita falls madly in love with Pedro. She will spend her life yearning for this futile relationship.The reader gets to know Tita in the kitchen. The smells, tastes, and textures of food are her world. With a touch of mysticism, unknown even to herself, Tita infuses the foods she creates with her strong emotions and infects those who eat of her food with overwhelming feelings.A lovely and quirky novel about the power of love, Esquirel introduces the reader to compelling characters who fight against the odds to determine their own destinies. This sensuous novel was simply entrancing."
4,A sweet little story,"Okay, the love story of Tita and Pedro is kinda corny, but the circumstances around them, the Mexican revolution, Mama Elena's cruelty, and, most important, Tita's recipes and the effects they have on those who enjoy them make up for that tiny detail. It is cleverly written, very sensual and charming, perfect for a lazy, rainy afternoon."
4,To Live In Misery And Die In Lovel,"Like Water For Choclate A mystical Mexican love story is a wonderful romantic fairy tale. A story about tradition, love, sex, and war. A story about the twelve months of the year. A recipe for each month,and home remedies. This story is exciting and keeps you wondering about what will happen next. If you like war, love, sex, and food you'll like this book. Once you start reading you'll want to keep going until your done. Like Water For Choclate, by Laura Esquirel. Give this book a try."
3,Entertaining but,"This book is fun, but its most interesting features are not totally original. The idea of mixing recipies with a story has been exposed before (i.e. in a spy story by Simmel about caviar and champagne). Also, the unexpected effects of some foods prepared on a certain way on some people reminds me of the effect that scent has on ""The Parfum"". In my view, the story and the storytelling is a bit too close to a soap-opera, but I must admit that the result is entertaining."
4,"This story gives you monthly recipes, love, anger, history.","Like Water for Chocolate is a story about monthly recipes, love, anger, history etc... Close to the beggining of the century, Esquivel brings the reader the story of Mama Elena and her three daughters. The younger one Tita, was destined to take care of her mother till she died. This meant that she coudn't get married until this happened. Pedro, Tita's soulmate, marries Tita's sister in order to be close to her. The story brings a magic realism that sparkles with Tita's recipes. Whatever she was feeling while cooking transferred to the people who ate the food. Trough the story we see the Mexican Revolution and how people went back and fort from Mexico and U.S. The plot is very well mixed with emotions, we see how Tita and Pedro fight for their love trough the novel."
4,Abby's LWFC Review,"Like Water For Chocolate, was an excellent book that i know everyone would enjoy. This book included an inticing plot that made the book a fun and fast read. For the most part the book was very easy. The thing i liked most about LWFC, was how you could learn about a different culture and also read about characters that had to deal with that culture. Being someone who mostly read non-fiction, the fantasy part in this fiction book sort of threw me off. Because of the plot, i wanted to have the book be real, but in the end it was merely fake. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,like water for chocolate,"Esquivel has produced a well-written novel that handles family traditions that so unwillingly bind us. It pursues romantic fantasy, desire, and rebellion. Tita, the main character, and Pedro kindle a passion for each other like no other, but are forced to unite in secrecy because Mama Elena forbids Tita to marry until after her death. Esquivel's style is poetic at times, intertwining life and passion. ""Like Water for Chocolate"" uniquely stands."
3,magical realism!!!,The novel Like Water For Chocolate was a book filled with magic and love. It had a lot of emotion and was for a reader with a creative imagination. Every chapter begins with a Mexican family recipe that will make your stomache groan. If you love food you'll love this book!
3,made me very hungry,"Like Water for Chocolate was not interesting enough to WANT to continue reading. I finished it, but towards the end, the time line was getting incredibly confusing. All of the characters were underdeveloped & I was a little disappointed with the way things turned out for all of the characters. I'd give this 3.5 stars b/c it is a magical, romantic story overall."
2,Forced Myself to Finish it,"Tita, the youngest of three daughters, is in love with Pedro and he with her. But she can't marry him because of family traditions which states that the youngest daughter is destinied to never marry and live to take care of her mother. Pedro then marries Tita's sister in the hopes of being, at least, near Tita.The novel spans several years, and there are 12 chapters, one for every month. The reader is introduced to a new recipe in each chapter and to the new events that happen in Tita's lives. Some border on fantasy while others take an almost satirical view, a parody even.Maybe I had high expectations, or maybe the translation didn't do the book justice, I don't know, but I found this book utterly boring. There were a few 'moments' that were interesting, but for the most part, this was a dull read."
4,A Love Story in the Magical Realism Style,"This novel is more visual than literary. It was very frustrating to read despite the mysticalbeauty of the images. The characters lacked choice and gumption, and other than Gertrude,were somewhat pat figures.The metaphors for food and life were good and the magical realism was stunning. The ro-mance between Tita and Pedro was unbelievably beautiful. Though the book annoyed meat times, I gave it a '4' for the beauty of its narrative."
4,Ten Times Better Than The Movie,"I saw the movie adaptation of Like Water For Chocolate some time ago, so my expectations were not high. The book is very good. It found a harmony between reality and mystical and it was a perfect blend. The characters are rich and the fabric of the story feels real, even when it's surreal. I was also impressed how well the translation held up in English. Excellent read."
5,Like water for chocolate,"I am a senior at Narbonne High School (NHS) I'm not really into reading books. Knowing that i had to read it to receive my grade i actually got hooked on this book. As the chapters went on continuosly talking about food and love affairs, the book seemed to be very interesting. the main subject about the book is about a couple that really loved each other but couldnt continue or get a relationship started becasue of a family tradiiton. During the time that the couple couldnt be together the girl expressed her feelings in the food that she cooked. the story goes on with realisim about a couple and their problems but through it all they had to go through many obstacles to.... I think that Laura Esquivel did a spectacular job on illustrating how love can surely be mixed with food. the book was a very, very good book and i would really look forward to read other books from Laura Esquivel."
3,This book was sad,When I read this book I felt very sad because I dont like injustice Mama Elena was a frustrated woman because when she was teenager her parents doesnt like she married with a mulato man .When Mama Elena had daugthers she made the samething but she hate only of poor Tita.I like when spirit Mama Elena apeeread Tita said leave me alone I hate you I know you secret finally this cruel mother desapear forever.
4,Wonderful Love Story,"I am Diana from Walla Walla High School and I read Like Water for Chocolate in my senior english class as part of our literature circles. Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in the family. Tita struggles to pursue true love and claim her independence. Tita's love, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to ask for Tita's hand in marriage. Since Tita is the youngest daughter she is forbidden by tradition and her mother, Mama Elena, to marry anyone. Pedro marries Tita's oldest sister, Rosaura to be close to Tita.This is a wonderful story that I enjoyed very much. I enjoyed the way Laura Esquivel put conflicts between Tita and her mother because it really shows the way the Hispanic culture is when it comes to marriage in a family that has a strong tradition.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read books of love and desire."
4,Love this book!,"How to describe this book? It's just one of the most beautiful stories I've read. This is not an action-adventure story, although there are moments of both, it's a story about family and food mostly. Almost from the minute this story began I was enthralled."
1,Not useful as a Buyer's Guide. Save your time and money.,I found this book worthless in helping me select a used Porsche.
2,Very little substance... and looks dated.,"I was looking to buy a Porsche and was searching for a book that would get down to the 'nitty gritties' of each model, but alas it really just gives a basic overview of each model. It does not feature potential problems of certain years which a reader would be looking for.I found more about models info surfing the net.The black and white pics in this modern age of colour also make it look dated. It also took too long for the book to arrive (8 weeks), by the time it arrived, I had already bought and driven one for a month. So if you're going to order a book over the web to assist you in a purchase and live outside the US order early and order wisely."
4,Best available?,"I found the book pretty helpful in detailing enough of the differences between different Porsche models/years (I was looking mainly at 911/993s and 928s). I did read the other reviews criticizing the lack of specifics, but I haven't seen anything better out there. (Please let me know if anybody does find a better guide!)Tsuan Li"
2,outdated,"This book covers porsche 911 models up to 1995. It does however cover the newer porsche boxters. The photographs provided are small, and lack detail. The technical specifications are scant. If you are a serious porsche fan, don't buy this book."
5,Great book that makes physics understandable.,"Art Hobson owns the gift of great teachers and authors. He understands, communicates, and visualizes. His writing is smoth, devoid of the wrinkles and creases that can jar assimilation. His book covers the precipitous changes in the world of physics as it climbed three great cliffs, from Aristotle, through Newton, then the Einstein revolution. Along the way he touches on the effects of these changes on our civilization. The difficult subject is brought to the level of understanding by anyone willing to devote some effort to reading, not necessarily studying the book. It's ""physics made easier"" by clever diagrams that portray concepts that words would not convey. The left margins of each page are adorned by quips and often wry statements of the great physicists and philosophers. The book is a treat, a great teacher, a perfect gift for anyone interested in the ""who, what, where, how"" of things and us. The ""why"" is left to the imagination of each reader."
5,Physics for NON-Pysics type person,"If you ever thought you were interested in physics or the way things work in the world around you, but thought you weren't smart enough, well - this is a text that shows that you are smart enough. It talks in human terms & doesn't talk down to you either. It shows that formulas are just shorthand for terms like 'ASAP'='As Soon As Possible' & so you use the shorthand to take less time and/or space. It contains plenty of 'WOW' factors also, which I really like. After each chapter, it has experiments to try & quizzes with answers to every other one for self-evaluation comprehension."
3,Good Enough,"The cover was a bit more tattered than I expected, but the interior of the book was good."
3,Pretty good all around,"This is a great looking book, however it did not get to me as fast as other companies got it to me."
3,Good for learning script,"I bought this book in hopes that it would teach urdu in a phonetic manner, however it teaches urdu based on learning the script first and foremost. This is a good book, however, if you are interested in learning the urdu script."
4,Helped My Daughter,I bought this book to help my daughter improve her Urdu reading speed and indeed this book was helpful in that regard. Simple explanations and clearly printed script make this book an ideal supplement for Urdu beginners... Go for it!
4,A GOOD WORK,"I think it's a very good book and it helps my in my Universitary studies.I really need a book which could explain me the Urdu grammar in a simply way, as this book does."
2,Incorrect packaging,"I ordered this item in a large quanity, but wanted the items packaged as shown. They were for favors in a holiday bag for the company employees. When they arrived a few were packaged as shown but the bulk were loose. If I had know they would come like this I would have gone to COSTO or some other discount store for the purchase. The cute little box that would have helped make them special and what I thought I paid for was missing."
4,dense but rewarding,I had no particular interest in Yugoslavia or the Balkans but her insight and detailed writing on its people and culture as a traveller was interesting and at times absorbing It is dense but good writing. One and a 1/2 inches thick seems daunting but there are paragraphs when insight and ideas turned into lyrical or beatiful or unusual poetry in prose as motivation enough Maybe the book is too thick for its subject matter but it tolerates browsing without disconjunction.
2,"Well written, but biased historical fiction.","I purchased BL&GF a week ago to read about the former Yugoslavia. I can understand that after the first Great War there was plenty anti German sentiment to go around. The racial and ethnic stereotypes do not stop with Germans but with Croats, Bosniaks, Montenegrins, and Macedonians. The latter which were referred to as either Bulgarians or Serbs. It was well written but historically inaccurate. All we need now is for Oliver Stone to Direct the movie."
1,1181 pages too many,"This book is a huge disappointment. Instead of discovering the history of a wonderful people, I found bigotry, racism, snobisness and intolerance. At page 200 or so, and after many tries to warm up to this author with her narrow-minded and slanted views, I decided to just put it down and search for unbiased history in other sources. To readers who haven't visited the Balkans, I'd suggest save your money to actually travel there. You won't be disappointed by the wonderful islands or it's people."
5,Like butter!,I was finally able to use this on my elk last fall and I have to say it did its job really well. You don't have to worry about it slipping out of your bloody hands or popping the gut sack if you go in to deep. I would definitely recommend this for real hunters.
4,Medical Advisor,"Love the book, replacing the last copy that got ate by the dog. Came quickly and in excellent condition. Thanks"
3,Really B-I-G,"This is a pretty nice plan book, but check the size dimensions before you purchase it! When fully opened it's almost 4ft. long, which makes it really impractical to carry around. But if you like the size and just want to use it on your desk, the layout is simple: each page has Monday through Friday listed on the left, with eight empty blocks across the pages for each day for filling in activities. The little teaching hints on each page are a nice addition, and the front cover pocket is handy--and of course it's spiral-bound so it lays flat. (But still wish I'd gotten a smaller one.)"
2,Too big,I prefer a plan book that is simple... this is oversized and takes up too much room on my desk. It also has a lot of pages I'm not interested in. I ended up giving it away and getting a simpler plan book.
4,Lots of Space!,As an Ed Tech teacher in an elementary building I see app. 500 students a week. With this planner I have all the space I need. At a glance I can see what I need and it makes following my schedule easy for substitute teachers. I like the spiral binding that makes the planner lie flat. I will be reordering this planner again.
3,Wrong size,I was disappointed in the size--too large. I guess I thought it would be a 9x12. Does not fit my desk well.
2,Too Big,It's okay - it does give you plenty of writing space but if you want convenience then Save your money - invest in a laptop.
5,Above and Beyond,"Jeffrey Powers has produced a detailed roadmap to life using an incredibly succinct style. His prophecy ""The Reach"" in 1994vis-a-vis the power of Corporations and of the Individual via the Internet is uncanny. His ""SmartUniverse"" reflects our wish for the ideal world while simultaneously exposing the issues reflected in a ""nation without borders""---mainly our current inability to attach terrorists to any particular land mass. If you read this book over and over, the subtleties of the Jeffrey Powers vision will become clearer and clearer. Getting to know Jeffrey Powers is a plus for individuals at all levels of sophistication."
3,"beautiful, but...","NEED TEETHING RAIL!!!Every day when I go and get my baby when she wakes up, she has white paint chips all over her face.I used velcro to attach the bumper pad, when I had to lower the mattress, the velcro was too high. I tried to take the old off and put new on, I stripped all of the paint off! AhhhhI probably would have still bought this crib because it is so pretty, but it is not very practical for the ongoing needs for baby."
3,Beautiful but smelly,We purchased this crib for our daughter and put it together a week ago. It is very attractive and sturdy but has a terrible smell to it. She has yet to sleep in it because we are concerned that the odor will make her sick. We have tried to air out her room with open windows and a fan but the smell is still very strong. We are tempted to return the crib for another style.
3,Poetry as History,"This little book of poems was originally written and published at the height of World War I. It is written from the perspective of Americans involved in that war. Americans overseas fighting, Americans waiting at home for news, Americans dealing with the death of a loved soldier, poems relating to all of these things and more are in this little book. For me, as an American living in 2008, it is fascinating for me to read these poems and try to imagine what life was like, and emotions were like, that allowed these poems to be popular at that time. I don't think the book would sell well today; the general population of American seems to be in a different place than the readers of these poems. Still worth a ponder."
2,Not Worth It,"Most of this product was just advertising for slim fast. Also it says in the product about must do excercises. Not all excercises must be done. I find there were few helpful tips about losing weight, mostly about losing it with slim fast. It is too general. A good weight cassette or book would really explain details about weight loss and health. Like show in clear details about excercies for beginners and how to progress to a healthy person for each individual. A good book/cassette would talk about tips and explain them fully and would not refer/advertise a perticular product. It did have good points like tips for motivating yourself. When I tried slim fast, it left me still hungry after I drank one slowly. Over all, if you are looking for a weight loss book/cassette and you like slim fast. This would be an ok(not great) cassette. If you do not like slim fast, keep on looking."
1,No external power supply!!,This card does not come with an external power supply. My Flash drive was detected but a file transfer did not work due to the lack of power supply. I'm ordering a card with the power supply (ex: Belkin) after my experience with this one.
3,They keep slipping off my plate and onto the floor,"I think the photo of this set on the website is a little misleading, because it doesn't really capture the exaggerated curve on the handles of the pieces. The combination of this curve along with the slick shiny finish and the weird weight distribution makes each utensil prone to slipping off your plate when you put it down to take a break from eating. Also, the smaller salad forks are way too small to eat anything with, I'm convinced that they are for shucking lobster claws and not much else. If you want to get a flatware set for looks and not for eating, then it's a pretty good buy, otherwise there are some other sets on this site that are similarly priced, have more pieces in the set, and don't slip off your plate as easily."
4,Great flatware!,"I really like the look and feel of this flatware set. They really are comfortable to use. The only complaint I have is that the curvature of the pieces vary from box to box, so that they don't lie perfectly when stored away. I think it might be due to different lot production. Other than that, they're perfect."
5,"Lovely, mysterious, superb for tripping...","The other dude's wack. This album is shiver-inducingly beautiful, spooky & sparkly. This ranks with Simon Finn's Pass the Distance as one of the greatest..."
1,Yuk. What a disapointment,"While there are a few highlights, most of this album is full of lowlights. Corny, hokey, lame, and just not really that good. I was disappointed."
2,Don't count on tech support!,"I downloaded an update driver that Interlink had mistakenly uploaded to Microsoft and it caused a failure of the RemotePoint and part of my system. Without appearing to try real hard or to be concerned about the mistake they had made, tech support was unable to correct the problem or even get my system to its previous status. They just gave up. Attempts to contact others in the company were futile.I don't believe they have their devices fully integrated and functional with Win 2000 or XP. I replaced the unit with the Logitech Cordless Desktop MX for Bluetooth. The Logitech mouse and keyboard installed flawlessly and both work great. Great range and much less cost. The Logitech units get Five Stars."
4,Fun Item to Own and Show,I rarely find Mark Martin items and would love this. I just can't justify the price.
5,Gives you a vision for homeschooling,"As someone considering homeschooling and not knowing many who did, it was hard for me to have a ""vision"" for how families did it - what did they do all day?? A homeschooling friend gave me this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It really gave me a feel not just for how different families approach homeschooling, but how I could - there's a lot of very practical ideas from very varied perspectives. I would imagine it would be beneficial also for someone currently homeschooling who is looking for some fresh ideas. I appreciated the many references to materials and comments on them. I recently got Mary Pride's books and am now going to go back to this book and see what worked for different families (looking in particular at the materials used by the familes I identified more with)."
4,"A warm, wonderful book","I enjoyed this book and its warm, realistic depictions of homeschooling families.I read this book aloud last summer on my father's porch swing, and my father passed by a couple of times and then he stopped, shook his head, and asked, ""Do ALL homeschooling families bake bread?"" And my friend and I laughed, because this particular book did seem to have a more back-to-basics flavor to it than more recently written books I've read.So perhaps the day-to-day life and activities as experienced by these families is not what I have personally experienced (in my whole 3 months of homeschooling) in my firmly suburban, densely populated area. However, the love and closeness that these homeschooling families share is quite inspirational and is DEFINITELY something that I am trying to nurture."
4,Pretty good book for those interested...,"I enjoyed thumbing through this book. I don't see it being a mainstay for every homeschooling family though. But this book is just that, a patchwork. It's good to own if you want to lend it out to those intested in homeschooling. I found it nice to read about how everyone's day goes."
3,Not as unbiased as I thought,"I am a non-christian interested in unschooling my kids and I was led to believe that this book showed all sides of the story -- some christian, some not, some ""school at home,"" some unschool, etc. For the most part it was variegated, but I felt it leaned heavily in the direction of christian ""school at home""-ers. Maybe someone should write a ""patchwork"" book all about 30 non-christian unschooling families! I'd buy it!I also felt that some of the parents MUST have fudged a little. I mean, the lengthy list of activities in one day seems highly suspect for some of the families. Isn't one of the reasons for homeschooling the unlimited amount of time you can spend on any one activity? I felt some of the parents doing the writing were self conscious and trying too hard to impress. For all the talk in the foreword/intro about ""imperfections"" many of them seemed too perfect. I would have preferred realism, warts and all."
5,Another Complete Museum in a book.,"The second entry in the Bank Street Museum book series is called Planetarium. The Museum that explores our solar system. Unlike a real Planetarium this kind of Planetarium in bookform is laid out in a museum tour format threw a space museum. All the Bank Street Museum books are laid out like museum tours. This one explores the nine planets. Each page is a hall about one of the planets. IE Hall of Venus, Hall of Mars, ect. There is even a Hall of Gravity, Hall of Spaceflight. You ride an imaginary rocket threw the museum and land on models of the Sun & moon. There is a pull out poster in the back of the book. Other titles in this Museum series include Dinosaurium, Oceanarium, & Floratorium."
2,Moses Did It,"This series explores if it could really happen this myths from the bible. They say in all of them yes it really happened despite some critics. The low rating is for the poor quality of the interviews, acting and special effects."
1,Please do not waste your time or money on this bit of trash,"Please do not waste your time or money on this bit of trash (I'm sorry that I did). Putting aside the absolutely pitiful production values, bad acting, and so on; the so-called proofs of historical accuracy of these stories are based, at least in part, on known hoaxes. Evidence presented to support the story of Noah's ark being present today on Mt. Ararat was disproven as a deliberate hoax many years ago. There is nothing of value presented on these discs. Better support for whichever point of view you may be coming from, whether supporting the historical accuracy of these stories or disputing it, can be found elsewhere."
5,Excellent and Intriguing,"This box set of 5 dvds actually contains 10 episodes, all about how modern science backs up the Bible. The series also visits counterviews to provide balanced arguments. You'll have your faith strengthened by this intriguing look at the ancient secrets of the Bible."
1,Dissapointing,"The good thing about this box set is the price! That's about it. I wanted a deep and detailed documentary about the events advertised on the box, and I came away feeling that I had learned nothing. The acting is amateur but that isn't important to me. The critics demonstrated baffling ignorance, and the researchers interviewed seemed to offer only trite sound-bites. Its a pity that so much wonderful research has been done on this subject by so many people, to which this series seems to not even scratch the surface. A more accurate description for this box set would be - ""Beginners guide to famous Bible events"""
3,Unmet Expectations,"I wish I could wholeheartedly recommend this book, seeing as it's about the fascinating historical figures Dr. John Dee and Rabbi Jacob Loew, but it just never gelled for me. The characterizations are interesting, but the plot is flaccid and I just couldn't make the necessary suspension of disbelief in order to really get into this fantasy tale. It does have some nice use of it's Eastern European settings, though."
2,iPod,"This armband is a bit of a disappointment. When you cinch it up, it twists. Then it's hard to staighten the band back up."
4,If you have a large to huge arm...Not for you.,It's a armband. Connects to the otterbox waterproof casing for the ipod touch. If you have a large to huge arm...Not for you.
5,SUPERB JAPANESE REISSUE!,"Highly recommendable for mini lp fans and collectors! highly limited release, only 2000 copy.SONG LIST :1. FOOL2. YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOMEONE3. HELLO L.A.

1,"Dr. ""Love"" Has No Clue About It","Only a woman who had a marriage end because of her own lack of interest of sex could have written a book like this. She writes that a lack of interest in sex does not mean a lack of love. I have discovered that only two groups of people feel this way: Men who have wives with a high level of sexual desire and who initiate sex on a regular basis, and women with a low level of sexual desire who probably lost a husband by saying ""I don't care if I ever do it again."""
5,Wonderful story of Good vs. Evil with a surprise ending,"I first read this book as a 17 year old and loved it! I just re-read it -and it's still just as good, 30 years later. Crosses all age levels. It's really a girl's story; I don't see my husband being interested in this. Bonnie Jones Reynolds now runs an animal rescue facility called Spring Farm Cares- her old family farm and the setting for this story. Someone call Bonnie and tell her this story should be brought to the masses and immortalized in the movies!"
4,"Great, unique novel.","While this book was in no way perfect, I could not help falling in love with it. For the first time in a LONG time, I found myself wondering what was going to happen next & thinking about the characters even when I wasn't reading it. The plot line and characters seemed to consume me for as long as I read the novel, and I stayed up late to finish it. It had a little bit of everything--romance, fantasy, danger, adventure--and had a very unique, GOTHIC feel that I love specifically because it is hard to find. I would recommend this book especially to fans of the Gemma Doyle trilogy, or other ""vintage"" books of the same mysterious genre."
4,Small town prejudices lead to unintended consequences,"This story is in someways a retelling of the Salem witch hysteria set in a small town in the late 1920's. Prejudices between family lines, ignorance, hysteria, and a taint of madness drive the behavior of the town. Characters are complicated with both good and bad characteristics. The story revolves around two sisters, Cassandra and Lilith. While there are hints of possible magic, most of the events can be attributed to coincidence or superstition or plain bad behavior/trickery. It was an unusual but interesting tale."
3,Not Attached,"The novel reminded me of a short story one reads in high school to discuss social, anthropological and religious intersections in a small village for the larger, global implications: gossiping, religious zeal (& manipulation), social hierarchy, education and generational divides in perspective/knowledge. It's not a bad read and setting descriptions are great, but it lacks depth in characters. Save perhaps for Upjohn (and a distant second in Harley, Lil, & Tobin), I was never committed enough to a character to emotionally attach myself (like or dislike) and at over 400 pages there was plenty of room for character development. Perhaps fewer more developed characters. Spoiler Alert: This is also one of those stories where you get to decide for yourself what happens to the characters after the abrupt ending. If you've made your way to the end expecting the semblance of a tidy ending (or even one with some direction), you won't find it."
4,"Not like the pic, but nice","I ordered the silvertone clock based upon the image shown - a duller silver with a green tint to the glass. However, the clock that arrived had no green tint and was a bright sliver - which is seen on the ""external site"" products. SO, if you see this clock, realize it may not be what you want - unless you want the silver with no green tint. Maybe someone should have taken some time to do some color correction in Photoshop. I love retro, so I give it a 4/5 - but the disappointment of not having what the image shows would be a 3/5."
1,Another Lying DVD Description,"I am so sick of progay movies being described as 'family dramas' that I think there should be a required notice on all progay movies on the DVD cover. This review isn't for those who think gaylife is acceptable. This is a warning to those who find it offensive to stay away from this movie. If they can't be honest with the description of movies they produce, what are they hiding about their lifestyle?"
5,woah,i just bought a bootleg tape of this a couple weeks ago and now i kind of regret it. ill just say that this movie is surprisingly great for a tv movie and its one of jim carrey's best performances. cant wait to see what special features come with it.
1,Title,Here I am searching for a positive book to send a friend who is still in shock having heard she has lung cancer. She is about to embrace the microbiotic diet and fight for her life. I'm sure the book is great - but the title doesn't reflect the positive sounding content. If they'd called it something like 'Win with Microbiotics' I'd feel happier buying it.
3,Healthy oils are essential,"Some of the ideas in this book are great; others are terrible. The important work that has been done since the 1980s concerning the essential, healing role that omega-3 fatty acids play in the human diet is not reflected in this book. Be very, very cautious if you use this book. Be sure to read widely to make up for the major deficits of scientific, nutritional knowledge that plague this author."
4,Cut Chemist - under rated producer,"I spin vinyl. I caught this from the movie ""whip it"". It was on the soundtrack, had to find it, get it, use it in my sets. Great production, good flow (bit repetitive) and Cut Chemist is one of my favorite West Coast hip hop heads, with his partner in crime, DJ Shadow. Jurassic 5, Brianfreeze, Sound of The Police, all classic beat manipulation wizardry."
3,Where's the Wonder Wheel tune????,"Just another INCOMPLETE soundtrack... Man, it's like a curse!1 - Where's the first 1:25 seconds from the soundtrack???? They are pure magic. Why they cut off this? Why? Why? Why? Why?2 - Where's the song for the Punks fight in the men's room?3 - Where's the song for Stillwell Avenue arriving?Sad..."
4,Excellent collection,"The year was 1979,music was the leader of expressionalism where culture and ideas clashed with one another. This soundtrack MIMICKS everything in the actual movie. When you hear the ""Furies Chase"" you immediately remember the scene. Barry De Vorzon sounds are all wonderful, the only reason why I purchase this soundtrack. Then you have great music like ""Love is a Fire"" by Genyan Ravan. Her voice is definitely up their with Stevie Nicks in the rock world.I say overall 6 out of 10 track definitely was worth buying. There maybe a few other if you're into smooth Latino or a Joe Walsh fan."
3,"high tech instrumentals and joe walsh with ""in the city""","The instrumentals are high tech and very upbeat. Joe Walsh does a good rendition""In The City"" along with a new version of ""Nowhere to Run"""
3,Wish more of the score was on this,Great cd to have but it is very short. I wish more music was included on this but maybe one day.
4,Great Soundtrack but...,"...you know what would really have rocked???One little sound clip -""clinkclinkclinkclink Warriors Come Out And Plaaaaayclinkclinkclinkclink Warriors Come out and PLAAAAEEEEEEAAAAYYYY""That would have rocked....."
4,Had to have the opening song,"Long ago I had to sell the vinyl version, along with the rest of my collection. And I always regretted the loss. The opening theme music stuck in my mind when I saw the movie in its first-run release. All these years, that music wasn't forgotten. This cd version surpasses the vinyl. And the music holds up pretty well, all things considered."
3,The Warriors,"Good CD but there are tunes on the disc that are not on the movie. That part is disappointing. Overall, cool!"
2,Incomplete album,"This album gets 2 stars based on the simple fact that Amii Stewart's ""Knock on Wood"" isn't on the soundtrack. Rediculous"
4,Bail Was Set At $ 6.000.000,"Strange title, I always wondered about it and write it with mistakes. If you ask me about the music, I should say that this is not the best Batmobile album for me.The sound's a bit dark and more oustanding from the previous two albums. But I think every Batmbile fan should buy this record. Note an interesting version of Motorhead's ""Ace Of Spades"".This is the only Batmobile release on English ""Nervous Records"" label. After that they returned to their own ""Count Orlock"", which is based in their homecountry of Holland."
5,Great Book!,"Lucas Bonner was a dead man-at least to the lynch mob that had left him swinging from a tree. But a faulty noose had literally saved his neck, and he fled to the desert, his soul embittered by betrayal...Until he found Elena, the beautiful white captive whose life he would save...and whose love he could never have. Elena O'Toole's nightmare was nearly over. Soon she would be reunited with her family and her betrothed after years of being an Apache slave. And she owed it all to Lucas Bonner, the moody, silent drifter whose face begun to fill her dreams."
1,My most wasted several hundred dollars,"When the printer worked, the output was fine. However, it has never worked properly. We bought a factory-refurbished unit but it came with 3 problems. The factory tech service gave us the run-around until the warranty expired (partially our fault for not pursuing it better, but even though we had emailed with complaints prior to the warranty ending, they wouldn't consider doing warranty work). Many of the things they expected us to do with it are ridiculous... we're just home computer users and don't expect to devote hours every day to tech support on our printer!With this big, heavy unit it is expensive to ship and techs have quoted us about $300 just to look at it and repair it... so our entire money that we spent on this printer a few months ago is wasted and the printer now doesn't work at all."
1,JUNK,"I have used this printer for 1 year and it almost daily crashes and prints ASCII garbage forcing reboot of printer. At least once a day!! Minolta sent tech out and replaced board but it still prints garbage once a day. The time lost makes this printer not worth buying.I waited for a year under my belt before I wrote. It crashed just now prompting me to share to save others from making mistake of buying. I would recommend spending a little more and getting HPs Color Laser which is falling in price fast.I also work in the IT world so not just frustration from a newbie, it's a lemon of product. I can guarantee you the post with 5 stars are new users and don't have the experience yet to comment but instead are awe struck with a new toy.With all the equipment I deal with each day, this is the biggest headache and kills productivity with needless lost time."
2,Disappointed User,"The Konica Minolta 2350EN does prints great color photos. Four things that would not allow me to recommend this printer:1) Menu on printer is difficult to use.2) The ethernet port is a problem requiring the computer and printer to be re-booted when the printer locks up.3) The paper going through the printer is ""rolled"" and difficult to flatten out because of the heat when prininting.4) The four toner cartridges is expensive to replace."
5,HP Killer,This Magicolor 2350EN is a dandy! It installed easily without any problems and prints beautifully. It's also fast and has a much smaller footprint than any HP color laser I've seen. I love it.
2,"Would not buy again: noisy, slow & finicky","We've had this printer for 2 years. The end product it good but it has been very unreliable for several months now. At times, for no apparent reason, it will print out an error message and non-sensical jibberish. It also seems to work very hard and slow for even 1 page: makes a very noisy clicking sound 3 or 4 times before it prints anything and then again for each page. I've called Konica Minolta several times, changed the driver, uninstalled & reinstalled it from Windows multiple times but nothing changes.We bought a monochrome, multifunction Brother machine a few months ago and we like it so much, I think we'll buy a color to replace the Konica."
2,4 Colour Frustration,I bought this laser model about 2004 and had problems with it from the outset. I got pages and pages of ASCII stuff sometimes at the start of a job and sometimes mid-way into a job.Minolta Support insisted I needed to get forensic diagnostic software to determine the problem with my computer. My computer was brand new at the same time as the printer.The saving grace of this machine is the quality of the output particularly on photos. Skin tones are not too good but probably as good as an inkjet on plain paper.Since OS X Lion the machine is better behaved but it will still paper jam on startup and throw an ASCII tantrum if it feels like. Tons of complaints on US reviews too.
5,HELMUT LOTTIE'S MUSIC IS WONDERFUL!!!,"I first heard Helmut Lottie on PBS a few years ago and from that moment on....I was hooked!! I was searching for his CD's all over the place and Amazon.com has the best selection without traveling to Europe!! Sei Mein, La Donna E Mobile,Santa Lucia and of course, ""Granada"",(which almost reminds me of Valencia) which is the best he sings on ""Helmut Lottie Goes Classics II"")This CD is a must for holders to HL Goes Classics I and II!! You won't be disappointed"
4,Nice variety,"10 concertos, each with nice solos for the featured instruments. If you are a little tired of violins, this is for you, with oboes, clarinets, horns, and the famous ""Concerto for Flute and Harp in C"". Only problem if you are a purist, is that there are just parts of each concerto, not complete. For example, part II of 3 parts. But a very enjoyable CD overall, at a good price."
5,Best Weight Gainer,"Fast and easy to mix, tastes good, provides a good amount of extra calories, you don't have to be a calf and drink 3 gallons of milk a day like other products in the market.Out of all the junk I had before, this is by far my favorite so far.Highly recommended."
4,Good Price for Good Product,My son is the one that uses these the vanilla is his favorite we ordered both vanilla and choc this time and he said the choc was rich. They work wonderfully for helping him bulk up he can drink one before lifting and one shake after lifting and it greatly reduces the soreness and gives him energy. With these he gained apox. 10 lbs in the first week and now gains 2-6 a week depending on the week. My son has trouble gaining weight he will eat 3500 calories a day and not gain an ounce. With these shakes I buy him Vit D milk to mix with them. This is a wonderful way to add more calories to his daily intake while making sure his muscles are getting all the extra they need. Timing is important due to the shake being filling.
4,"Quite Simply, It Works",This product (vanilla flavor) does what it's supposed to: provide a very calorie-dense food that's natural (insofar as powdered mass gainers are ever natural--you don't exactly seem them growing in the garden) and tastes good (albeit very sweet). My only caveat is just that it tends to clump a lot when mixed by hand in a Blender Bottle. You can partially circumvent that problem by shaking vigorously and then letting it sit for 15 minutes or so to dissolve further.
3,Son didn't like the taste,"I had previously purchased the WeightGainer 900 in vanilla for my son. He liked that but wouldn't drink the 1200 in double vanilla. Just be aware that the taste is very different. Otherwise, the WeightGainer products are great!"
3,Watch out,"I give this three stars solely because I was unaware that there is a lot of lactose protein in this gainer. Im lactose intolerant so I was losing more weight using it than I was gaining. Not there fault,it was mine for not looking. But just a warning to whoever buys this. If you`re lactose intolerant dont buy it. As far as taste and mixability, the taste isnt that bad but you have to use a blender to get this stuff to mix. You cant use a hand shaker"
1,No weight gain,I didn't notice any weight gain after having this for a month. I would not recommend this to anyone. Try some alternate brands.
1,Health ingredient Hazard!! Contains Aspartame,"This product contains neurotoxin, cancer causing, bone marrow diminishing, human addictive Aspartame. Very dangerous. Will not buy this product again. Many weight gainers have it. Please be aware."
2,over priced,"It wasn't a bad video but for 40$ it could have had better production value, Video examples of strategies ect. I was kinda dissapointed it seemed like he gave a last second, free seminar and they video taped it and sold it. There are better videos out there and I'm a huge Syracuse and Jimmy B fan so it's hard for him to dissapoint me."
2,A Comic Book in Words,"The bottom line is that if you enjoyed the first book, you will most likely find the conclusion fun as well.However, that out of the way, those who are looking for more than just comic-bookish situations, a comment which I will explain below, might want to pass.The heroes are VERY heroic, the villains VERY evil, and the ambiguous characters are very conflicted. There is no room for the reader to figure things out; if the author wants you to notice something, you'll get bludgeoned with it.The plot is melodramatic, given to extremes and deus ex machina. Why talk to someone you can fight, dominate, or control. When things seem hopeless, there's always a deific hand to show the way.While the book certainly succeeds in its efforts to be ""bigger than life,"" it does so at a level that fails to impress more discerning readers."
3,"Good Book, but with Flaws","THis book was very action packed, which I liked. It tried to keep slow moments to a minimum.Only problem that I have is that the author creates a lot of conflicting interests with the actual 40k universe. First the black rage is a gene curse that the blood angels keep secret. Why would a inquisitor be allowed to share in some of their chapter rituals? Also other than the Ultramarines most founding chapters are weary of Inquistors.I think if the Author decides to write more the 40k fans, he should research his plot line a little more.All in all, it was an entertaining action book, but if you are looking for more character building you should pass."
1,A weak Story,"As with the first book, this story is weak in every respect. The plot is shallow and predictable, and the author's understanding of the Warhammer 40K storyline is minimal (at best)."
4,Good book to begin learning cursive,I used this book for teaching 3rd graders cursive and I found it to be helpful.
2,BO-RING,"I loved the dark materials series. Loved em. After I finished all the books, I wanted to learn more about Philip Pullman and the process he went through to write the books.This DVD has plenty of boring voice over narration and interviews with people who don't provide any additional useful information on anything whatsoever."
5,RUPAUL ROCKS,"I love Rupaul and all his works. Talented and a man of a thousand faces . He sings, act and produces. Amazing!"
1,Low quality. Just Highlights. about 30 minutes total,"Warning! This is a low quality video that only briefly gives highlights of the history of Germany. There are few specific details. It only mentions highlights in passing. For example: Teutoberger wald (15 seconds) Charlemagne (30 seconds monstly about Aachen), Hameln (45 seconds about the Pied Piper story). The first part covers from prehistory until 1648 in about 10 minutes mostly discussing different citie's roles in major historical events."
1,Little support for an intricate simulation game.,"The Brandmaps simulation is an outstanding learning tool. The complex nature of this game requires a tremendous amount of time and effort to be an effective competitor. This book provides only a base of general information for the game user. It is sometimes difficult to follow and does not adequately cover advanced senarios. Knowledge of strategic planning, corporate strategy, and brand management are definitely a plus before entering into a game.A moderately good textbook at best."
2,Not what I expected,"The collar is loose in the back of the jersey. So when you wear it, it sorta props itself up like a coat jacket... It is hard to explain but I thought when I bought this jersey, it would look like a shirt.The fabric is uncomfortable and a static clinger.Logo is nice and big. I wished I could have tried it on before buying."
2,Just not worth the time.,"The 2 stars are for the first story after that this book is BORING. The second story is good if you want to learn to play the card game hearts,But other then that just a total waste of time."
3,"Comes in with a bang, out with a wimper","I would rate this book five stars - if King had just kept going with the first story (Low Men in Yellow Coats). This story is great, with a strong Lord of the Flies allusion, that actually continues on across the other stories in this collection. The characterizations of the mother, son and recent arrival in the neighborhood are strong. The story also has a subtle ""creepiness"" that kept me on edge. The other stories in the volume are much less satisfying, as the protagonists are less well developed, and generally less likeable. Hearts in Atlantic (story 2) is the best of the rest, because King succeeds in creating some suspense and an interesting view of the UMaine in the 60's. The other stories are sort of forced."
3,The plot seemed interesting enough to continue.,"Bobby's mother seems to be sleeping with her late husband's and now her boss, but poor Bobby is only eleven and still isn't open to seeing what is happening. The new tenant, Ted, is awkwardly suspicious. I personally wouldn't trust him either, but this was the sixties and times were different back in the day."
5,A Heart in Maine,"Young, carefree children start King's latest and in my opinion best novel in their home town of Harwich struggling with the pressures every eleven year old faces. They eventually grow apart and like in so many King novels all face greater problems and the hardships that follow us all into adulthood. The content for me isn't overly important in this novel but never has a King novel touched me on so many different levels and never have I read a book where almost everything from childhood to college seemed so familiar to me and my own life. Not since I first read Christine have I ever read an entire novel in one sitting and that was over a decade ago. The monsters in this book aren't as big as usual, you won't find them hiding under the bed either. They are small demons in your face and by God do they have sharp teeth. They are real lifeKing has produced a masterpiece. Like the vulgar DeSoto found in the first story this book is alive."
4,This work was not written for me...,"I am, what King would consider a ""constant reader."" I have read almost everything the man has ever written and I love all of his work. He is gifted and talented. Atlantis is a book that was not written for my generation, it was written for my parents. I'm a child born out of the very early 80's... this book was written for my mother's generation, for King's generation. I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it, King is never a waste of time, but I wouldn't read it again."
5,One of his best,"This book is fantastic. Just enough fantasy. Best thing is, the story of these kids' lives would be just as great without the fantasy, but adding it in just made it better. Absolutely one of the best S.K. books i've ever read, and i've read them all. The movie just doesn't do the book justice at all."
3,Should of stop after first part of the book!!,"I must admitt, I thought this book would of been great with a perfect ending after 300 or so pages of this book, basically, just part one of this book. Part one of this book deserves five stars!!! It ended pretty well with some questions in mind but I felt that ending was left up to the readers imagination!! Why did Mr. King continued with the rest fo the book??? I understand there were parts in the important later on but I could of cared less!! It just dragged and dragged and dragged. Honestly, I didn't cared for this book at all as a whole. This is my first Stephen King novel but I been recommended to read some of his previous greats, which, I will some day. But for now, if you never read any Stephen King novels I wouldn't recommended this book. Please try something else!!!"
5,"Stephen King, at his best","This review will be short and sweet: I loved this book. I loved this book so much that I refused to see the film adaptation with Anthony Hopkins out of love for the words and not to be betrayed by the screen. It is absolutely brilliant. I have been reading Stephen King since the 8th Grade with Salem's Lot and this is by far, the absolute best that he has written. I finished this and Bag of Bones back-to-back and I honestly believe King is writing the best he ever has. Beautiful. Poignant. When the boy received the flower petals in the mail, it nearly brought me to my knees. I was truly, truly sorry when I finished it. I just wanted it to go on and on."
2,Not Very good,"Like other reviewers,I really wanted to like this book,but was unable to do so.It is becoming apparent that Stephen King peaked somewhere around 1983,with only a few bright spots""Misery,""""The Green Mile"", since.I say this as someone who once waited eagerly for each new king book to come out.""Hearts in Atlantis"" is king's attempt to come to terms with the 60's,and specifically,Vietnam,but I feel that he has failed.The stories were uninteresting,the characters unlikable,and if it hadn't been a Stephen King book,I doubt that I would have continued reading.I know that in the past King has mocked authors who take 5 years or more between books,but maybe it's time for him to take some time off,recharge his batteries,and come up with some stories worth telling.Go back and read ""Night Shift"" or ""The Dead Zone"",and then tell me ""hearts in Atlantis"" is the best that King can do."
3,"i love stephen king, but...","I had just read 11/23/62 and I was eager to read something like that. It started out a little spooky, then went serious."
2,What has happened to Stephen King?!?,"Like many of the reviewers,I am a huge SK fan. I belong to the SK library and eagerly await his newest book,but I have to admit that the last couple of stories he has put out don't have the throat grabbing suspense that all previous works had. Bag of Bones was ok,it had it's moments. The Girl who loved Tom Gordon was just very uninvolving and his latest,Hearts In Atlantis was just plain boring!! The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for title story. I at least got through that one quickly and it actually had some merit. Please Mr King,return to the kind of novels that made you who you are today. Give us something that will scare the hell out of us and keep us on the edge of our seats!!!!!!!!!!!! I look forward to your next Dark Tower book with great anticipation but as for your next novel,I'm just not too sure anymore."
3,Hearts in Atlantis,"Hearts in Atlantis is about the story of three best friends and how they started their lives and how their lives really turned out.Hearts in Atlantis is a book that teaches you some of lifes greatest lessons. In it you will learn that you should find out who you really are and not be afraid of it. Find out why life shouldn't be wasted and that you should stand up for what you believe in.Hearts in Atlantis is a pretty good story, not one of Stephen Kings best, but still pretty good. If you have the time you should look into reading, but it isn't a must read book. Also, if you are afended easily by either swearing or sexual things then this is not the book for you."
3,Not his best,"The first story about Bobby and Ted is the most fulfilling. The characters and situations are compelling, but its supernatural elements are vague and never explained, and then the story simply ends. The rest of the book is forgettable, and only tenuously tied into the first story. I kept wanting the book to come back around to Bobby and Ted, to understand the mystery hinted at in the first section, and some satisfactory closure. At the very end, Bobby does resurface but it's far too little (still no resolution to the mystery) and far too late."
5,my road to the Dark Tower...,"I read the first half of this book in a collection of Stephen King stories i found at the grocery store.As soon as i began reading ""Heart's in Atlantis"", i couldn't put it down... i read it in about 2 days time.Some parts were so intriguing to me that i just HAD to have more... so i bought the GUNSLINGER (the original edition)...since then i was hooked on the Dark Tower series. Completey nerded out on it.I have since finished the 7 Dark Tower books, and currently read the marvel comics series. All thanks to Hearts in Atlantis... a really good book.bewm."
5,Can't put it down!,"I'm normally not a King fan, except for The Stand, but Hearts in Atlantis is great. I started it on a Saturday and contemplated calling in sick to work on Monday to finish it!"
2,A collection of incomplete stories,"I'm baffled by the reviewers who rated this book highly, it makes me wonder if we read the same book.This book is a collection of stories, that loosely tie together, but not in any overall plot system. In fact, none of the stories particularly has a ""plot"" as youd typically define it.When I approached the end of the book, I developed a sickening feeling as I realized there were too few pages left for the book to develop anything of interest for the end. The book fizzed out with no climax, but then there had never been any build up of anything TO climax, so that wasn't very surprising.Very disappointing."
2,Not the best of King,"Hearts in Atlantis is definitly not King at his best. If you have the time, and only if you have the time, you should at least try to read it. Maybe you'll like it.Hearts in Atlantis is about three best friends and their story growing up. Learn how you should stand up for what you believe in and that life shound't be wasted doing things you may regret later in your life.If you don't read this I don't blame you. The first couple of sections were pretty well done, but through the rest of the book I had to force myself to finish."
5,An Amazing Piece of Literature!,"Hearts in Atlantis is one of the best Stephen King books I have read, and I have read almost all of them!!! I could barely put the book down, and constantly stayed up until all hours of the morning until I had completely devoured the book. I can't wait to read it again...something I rarely ever do!!! It really brought the 60s alive for me, considering I am a child of the 80s and 90s. I reccommend it to EVERYONE!!"
4,Never far from Atlantis,"Let me start by declaring that I am not an unconditional Stephen King fan. The 'horror' genre leaves me cold, and it's only when King ventures into more mainstream themes that I enjoy his work. I enjoyed Atlantis immensely.These boomers coming of age in the twilight zone of Vietnam, and living out their inevitable tragic final chapters of that generation are satisfying and fully formed. Their frailties as engaging as their strengths. None of these stories stays in the world of the surreal or what passes for the real world for long. The transition is so seamless that the reader isn't certain where it lies. That is when I love King -- when he blurs that jagged edge of reality!"
5,"I remembered, it hurt, and I cried.","You see I grew up in the late 60's and early 70's. Much of what is in this story I lived through. Granted, the first part of the book is a little off the wall and somehow relates to the Gunslinger series though I am not sure how. I can say this much, the rest of the book about first loves, school, the game of ""Hearts"", the Peace movement, and God forgive us all, That War, seems like they happened only yesterday sometimes. How did they all fit together? As in the book, I didn't know then and I can't say that I ever will. ___ + ___ = Information. JCD"
3,"Does it need the sci-fi, creepy stuff?","This is the first Stephen King novel I've read. It starts from a young boy's point of view and is quite well written. The little hints of something weird going on were genuinely creepy. I have to admit it was the first time in many years that I felt uneasy putting down a book and turning off the light! However, at the end of the section the weird creepy stuff is fully revealed in all its silliness - what a letdown! Rather than being scary it is just cartoonish.The next section was about students on a college campus, and it may have even been better than the first section. Notably, nothing creepy or otherwordly happens!There are another few shorter sections that are much weaker.The book would have been better without the sci-fi elements, which felt tacked on and unnecessary. If Stephen King wants to write a non-horror novel about the 60's he should just go ahead and do it. He could use a pseudonym if he likes, so as to not disappoint his horror fans."
2,An Okay Airplane Read...,"This book was pretty bland and disjointed, but moderately entertaining. The Green Mile was the first Stephen King book I had read in fifteen years and I loved it, so I was excited to pick up Hearts in Atlantis as another ""non-traditional"" Stephen King novel. It seems like Stephen King had multiple disconnected stories that he then went through unnatural acts to join together in Hearts in Atlantis... It's a stretch to bill this novel as a brilliant meditation on Vietnam when the first half of the novel is a poor excuse for a science fiction/mystery story -- I thought the wrong cover had been put on the book. I was left very disappointed after the hype. Go in with ""low"" expectations (no pun intended) and expect a mindless, beach book or airplane type read."
2,More of the same formula,"I have just read thru some of the other reviews for this bookand people seem to love or hate it. I must be the odd one out as itleft me feeling neither one way or the other. I agree with a lot of people who said the first section of the story is the best, very straightforward King. I felt the book lost the thread way half way through and never regained it. I was waiting for a revalation at the end, some point to the story and it never came. I might be missing the point myself, but I don't thnik so. I have been a huge fan of Stephen King since Carrie & Salems Lot, but I'm finding his books increasingly formulaic and predictable, almost repetative in style if not content. He seems to be leaning more towards 'normal' stories these days, I think Insomnia was the last King book I really enjoyed reading. By normal standards Atlantis is a good book, but for Stephen king just good is well below average."
5,Just Read the Review,"I haven't read the other stories in this book. I have only read ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"". I could have just been satisfied with this story as the whole book. It ranks among King's best work. Including ""IT"" ( hard to believe, don't you think), Green Mile, Different Season's, or the Dark Tower Series. It pains me to think of what Bobby went through in the story. I won't say, you'll have to read for yourself. In the end, this is one great story, the other's are probably great too. I just think that they won't be as sensational as ""Low Men in Yellow Coats""."
3,Hearts in Atlantis,Certainly not the complelling story of the GREEN MILE but a good tale. The biggest flaw in the audio version is Kings readings. William Hurt brings the characters to life and seems to understand the timing and delivery of their feelings better than the author. Kings voice is like finger nails on a chalk board. Nasal and annoying.Hurt is a great reader and the characters he reads about are the ones I will remember.
2,Hearts in Atlantis,"This book was some what of a let down after reading Bag Of Bones and The Green Mile. Stephen King said ""He was a child of the sixties and wanted to write about it"",I grew up in the fifties and sixties and I could not relate to anything in the book. I got half way through the book and just put it down, it just wasn't going anywhere."
3,"Not bad, but not his greatest","Hearts in Atlantis can be described as average when compared to other works by Stephen King. I have been an avid reader of King for several years, but this is the first book I had to force myself to finish. The first story, Low Men in Yellow Coats, was quite compelling and enjoyable. The stories that followed, however, lacked the interesting storyline that is needed to keep me going. As far as the writing goes, it is King at his best, as usual."
3,"""Hearts"" promises much but delivers much less","This book began with a bang and ended with a whimper. The novellas got progressively shorter & progressively weaker & more confused. I enjoyed the tie in of the first novella with the Dark Tower series & fully expected the rest of the book to continue in that vein & bring all the disparate threads together. Instead, King just drops the Dark Tower references & comes to a much less than satisfying conclusion. If you are expecting the typical King neatness & continuity, this book is particularly disappointing. Taken individually, the novellas, especially the first two, are not bad, but together, they lack cohesiveness & direction."
2,Rather borrow than buy.....,"Errrr..... I might be out of line here, but how can the first part in this novel('Low men in yellow coats') be compared to earlier works of Mr. King exploring the theme of kids growing up, like 'IT' and 'The Body' from 'Different Seasons'? It seems to me that Mr. King might be losing his touch and I SERIOUSLY doubt if this novel would have sold this well under another author's name.... Still, it has its moments, I suppose (the final part is the only part which gave me goosebumps). And, of course, if you're an avid follower of the brilliant 'Dark Tower' series, you just can't skip it...."
4,KING LINKS AGAIN,"ONCE AGAIN KING USES HIS WONDERFUL STORY WRITING ABILITY. HE USES IT TO LINK THE STORIES IN EACH OF THE HEARTS STORIES WITH EACH OTHER. AND ALSO LINKS THEM SOMEHOW WITH THE DARK TOWER SERIES. THE LOW MEN IN YELLOW COATS, RIP RIP IN STORY TWO AND SO ON.. AMAZING --- YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION OR YOU WILL MISS HIS INGENIUS GENIUS."
2,Quite disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Stephen King's horror books, but this wasn't a horror book. It seemed more like adult contemporary fiction, the kind of thing you hear on Oprah. The first story was great, but it all went downhill from there. The first story was the only one that had a ""boogeyman"" or any element of the supernatural. The rest were just about sad misfit people lamenting events that happened in their childhoods. If this book had been by a new author, I wouldn't have read any more books by the author."
3,Average King,"I had to read this book immediately, as I do all of Kings work and have since 6th grade. I like it, I cared about the characters and was drawn ""in to"" the story as I am only when reading King. I didn't thik it was on the par with ""The Stand"", which I consider a modern masterpiece, but lets face it folks....Kings avererage is better than the rests best.Mr. King, I'm your number one fan! Hahahaha-Annie(aka Angela Pickle)"
5,"1# fan, Fredrikstad, Norway","This is a great book! Its somhow different from outher King book, but still its great. I got this for xmas 2001. I had wanted it for long, but not in Norwegian. Finaly my aunt had order it from someplace. Its fritening in the way, coz I had never thought of the vietnam war in a way King write about it. I have learend about it in school and so, but I never seemed to listen about it. I learned something from this book, how awful the vietman var was. This book made me cry! Its not many times King has made me cry, but he did. Its sad in a way, still its fritening, and that all mixed together makes a relly relly great book, its recomented for you people out there who understand the ""Reading for fun"" term!! This book will make you laught, cry, and be scared for daylight! I can ashure you that! I cant wait to see the movie, or start riding it again!!"
3,"""Interesting bit of nostalgia--twisted but fitting""","This is the second book I've read by Stephen King, and I must admit, I liked it a lot better than Black House. The first section about the children living in Connecticut and the old man and the ""low men in yellow"" coats started leading in the same direction as Black House. I found this disconcerting and almost quit reading, however, the next section had a different twist. Each section contained at least one character from the previous one, and so, in a sort of twisted way, they all fit together--like a puzzle. Kings liberal use of the 'f' word was offensive to me, but I have to admit, I enjoyed this book. I actually wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins, and thought I'd like to have a frame of reference from the book. Happy reading."
2,"Skip the book, see the movie.","I saw the movie first, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Kings books always seem to translate very well to movies, but I have always loved the books more because of King's meticulous attention to creating a character through subtext. His characters cannot always be conveyed on screen with the same sense of three-dimensionality that he creates in the written word. So what a disappointment to find the shallow and lifeless characters who populate this book. I slogged through it, always hoping that the next page I would understand who these people were, and why the did the things they did. The plot was jointed, the tone of the story has awkward shifts and transitions. I got the sense that this book was a hurry-it-to-the editor effort. Too bad--I wouldn't recommend this one, but it won't make me skip the next King novel."
2,Not so great story; Terrible audiobook narration,"I'm not crazy about King's work in this book, but my real complaint is with Hurt's narration in the audiobook. (King and Hunt split narration duties. King narration work was wonderful as always.) Hunt's reading for large parts of this book sound almost as if he had been half-asleep or drunk. I thought the book was misrecorded at the wrong speed, but then I heard King's sections, and it seemed just fine. Hurt's ""style"" is more than distracting, and I regret this purchase. I do not recommend the audiobook version of Hearts In Atlantis."
3,Book is 5* - Audio is 3*,"The story is great - one of King's best in fact but the production is terrible.Many of the 60+ minute CDs only have 2 or 3 tracks which means that if you stop or eject the CD you're going to have to FF the CD to the point that you stopped. A major headache if you've stopped the CD 49 minutes into a 50 minute track. Yes, there are tracks that long. Very sloppy.Every other CD-Book I've listened to has had at least a dozen tracks so you can start and stop easily. For whatever reason, S&S decided that they didn't need to do this for HIA."
4,William Hurt's reading is wonderful...,"I'm not a regular reader of Stephen King's work, but I wanted to read the book after seeing the movie. It was so much ""my"" era, it touched many chords in my memory. This version (the audio) of Hearts in Atlantis was recommended to me as the best way to experience the book.I wasn't going to listen to the entire thing -- just the first story, which was mostly what the movie was based on, and is by far the longest (8 tapes). William Hurt ""becomes"" 11-year-old Bobby Garfield as he reads the story. He's terrific. And I went on to listen to the rest of the stories -- I had difficulty stopping. It drew me in.Some parts are not easy to listen to, going back to Vietnam as they do, but I recommend it. The parts of the book that are not read by William Hurt are read by King, and he does an excellent job as well."
5,Hearts in Atlantis,"This book held me so close I couldn't quit listening, ""reading"", (audiobook). Stephen King has put out so many novels, and this one truly shows you that he is thee master of the typewriter. The story does not come at you immediately, but once it bites, your are in its grips. Then I went to the Movie version of this book. How truly sad. I had to immediately go re-read, (listen), to the book again just to make sure that I had not mad a mistake and I loved it more the second time....Stephen King is great and he is training Peter Straub (who may really need no training because he is awsome), to be great. Book was A+++++"
2,"Not bad, but way too slow - three short stories made long...","Don't take me wrong - this is not a bad book, and you may enjoy it. But the book is getting only 2 starts from me. The book is three (or was it four?) short stories that are somewhat connected (common characters at different periods of their life). The writing is good as usual, it's Stephen King after all. The story is almost non-existing. At least there is no original story that I love many other Stephen King's books for. If I could turn the clock back, I probably would not have spent my time on reading this again."
2,Really not that good...,"I, like many of the other reviewers, was disappointed in this book. The first story was interesting and I enjoyed it, but it went down hill from there. I kept waiting for him to tie it all together at the end, and it seemed like he was going to, but it just didn't happen; At least not for me. There were just too many unanswered questions... like who were the breakers? Who were the ""low men""? How did the glove go from ""Blind Willy"" to Sully? What did Willy ever do about the cop?"
3,Audio is worth a listen,"My review is specifically about the CD audio book version of Hearts in Atlantis. I was impressed by the story line and the complexity King wove into the characters and situations. There are several powerful emotional moments that made me sit and listen longer than I should have - people were waiting for me! As noted elsewhere, the book itself is actually 5 novellas. The 1st, 4th and 5th are read my William Hurt, the accomplished actor. Novellas 2 and 3 are read by King himself. Hurt is a much better reader, and his slow, lazy delivery initially hides the complexity and depth of his voice characterizations. King is not an actor, but he does well enough. I think the 1st novella is a stand-alone volume, worhty of a 4 or 5 star rating on its own. The 2nd story is laced with profanity which I found difficult to listen to. Things pick up again when Hurt resumes reading in the 4th story. From the 4th story onward, I couldn't wait to get to the end! I was hooked!"
2,Listen to the audio version if you are an insomniac,I tried to listen to this audiobook while driving... I WANTED to listen to this book... but William Hurt reads SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOW and like some smarmy college professor trying to impress people with his reading inflections. It was so bad that I couldn't make it through the first chapter. Maybe I'll try it again when I have a speed control or if someone else reads it.
3,SHOULD'VE KEPT 'LOW MEN' AND THROWN AWAY THE REST,"I don't know why Mr. King felt the need to chime in on his Sixties views now, after more than 25 years of popular writing. I'm sick of hippies and their sob-stories--""oh how will we get over, man? How? No more college, man. No more protests, man. No more tie-dyed, rose-colored acid trips, man."" Who cares? Do hippies really care at this point? I'm guessing no. What Mr. King should've done was keep ""low men in yellow coats"", the books first and longest story (and one of the author's best, I might add; in the same league with his early masterpieces, like The Body) and thrown away the rest. They're all monotonous, mirky and miserable--and in one case, just flat-out stupid. Mr. King needs to be a more efficient editor of his work."
3,Trying to please everyone?,"I love Stephen King, I'm a huge fan, however I prefer it when he scares me. Low Men in Yellow Coats, the first story in this book is in that vein. It reminded me a lot of Insomnia and even Needful Things. I really liked the other stories but I didn't think they hung together very well. It was almost like King was trying to please his fans (who like to be scared - story 1) while being a *serious* writer as well (the other stories). Does he care that much about critical opinion? I noticed in Low Men that he makes some poorly veiled digs at literary critics (eg. about *real writers*) - does he have a complex that his writing is not taken seriously? My advice Steve if you're reading this (as if) is to forget the critics and think of your adoring fans - write for us, and scare us stupid, please!"
3,A little disappointed,I read this book as I read all previous King's books. I really enjoyed the fist story (Low Men in Yellow Coats) but I was completely surprised by the second one as I was not expected different stories but a novel. Those stories are too close to be read separately but not enough to be a novel as they're all linked together. I read most of the stories wondering how the circle will close at the end (as you can expect with King). For the fans only.
2,Hearts in Atlantis,"I loved the movie so much that I wanted to read the book. The book had dark and creepy undertones, where the movie didn't show that at all. The movies made growing up in the sixties look fun, the book was strange, for example cars weren't really cars, they were alive. Movie was great, book not so much."
3,"Pleasing, but only halfway","I enjoyed the first story, that in itself should have, in my opinion, been released as a novella and he should have left it alone. From there, it goes all downhill. The second story was good, but nowhere near the quality of the first. Continue this until you reach the end, which leaves you not only wondering where in the hell the plot went, it only brings more questions. The stories seem to make these people not only actors in a play that they so horribly mess up and we are forced to endure their mistakes, it brings us conclusions that make no sense. I'm glad that some closure is brought about by the last story (and relief that it is finally over), it also just makes you angry that the first story wasn't a novel in and of itself. As said before, it could have been better, but it could have been worse. It is no Green Mile, but it was better than Gerald's Rant, er, I mean Game."
4,As good as it gets,"The master of horror, wit, humor and hair raising prickly skin, has done it again. This book captures your imagination while recalling bits and pieces from his past writings and those of whom are familiar, delve deeper into the story with the sense of ""I've been here before."" This is a great read and I'm glad I beat the rush and bought it a month ago."
5,Thouroughly Amazing,"I don't know how anyone could not LOVE this book. King successfully brought me into the jungle with the soldiers, back to college and, most importantly, let me revisit my own childhood. It was simply the best novel I have read in the past 5 years."
3,THE KING IS on his way BACK,"I can't say he is totally back but I will say he is on his way and getting in the old groove.There are 5 stories total. BUT stories 2-5 hang off story 1. Story 1 being the best and the rest unfortunately, like I said, just sorta hanging there. Especially Blind Willie. Don't expect roller coaster chills and thrills or even a strong ending. I was disappointed at it's lack of hills and valleys..and a strong end but then.... it was still a pleasure just to be reading Stephen King's words. The man has a way with em. His imagination and ability to relate are genius.Anyway, this IS a definite step in the right direction, especially after his two previous debacles, Storm of the Century(peeU) and that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (uck!). I didn't like Dark Tower IV either."
4,Creepy!,"I love how these five stories are related by both major and minor characters; the reader is forced to remember the minute details that make Stephen King such a great suspense writer. He constantly collides the real and the fantastic and makes one realize the possibility of all things good and evil. The reader is afraid of both the monsters and the men who they unhabit---the monsters being the Vietnam War, paranoia, and even one's own parents. What a great book!"
5,great interplay between stories,"I really liked the way the stories worked together ,especially liked Low men in Yellow Coats, and the next story brought me back to working in a record store with all the college kids & their protests."
4,Second only to The Stand,"Stephen King has done it again. I really enjoyed Hearts of Atlantis. The only drawback I could find was that I felt the story of ""Blind Willie"" was cut short. Perhaps Mr. King will expand upon him in a revised and longer edition of ""Hearts"" as he did with ""Trashcan Man"" in The Stand. One can only hope. Thank you Stephen for many enjoyable hours of reading."
1,"oh great another ""horror"" story from King","I fell asleep reading this. As i did with bag of Bones. I suppose when you've made a qaudzillion bucks you can get away with not dealing in horror anymore.oh wait - it is horror. Just a differnet kind of horror. Umm ok...I suppose I'll give it one star then for ""horror""Hope he gets back to writing what made him rich in the frist place."
3,Promising but loses it,I am not an avid reader of Mr. King but this book interested me based on the description. It is broken up into 4 short stories and a prolouge. The first two stories were enjoyable and heartfelt. The other two were just riduculous. King was trying to put so much symbolism into it that it became pretentious. I suggest readign the first two stories and then jump to the prologue.
2,disappointing,"Hearts in Atlantis was an effort for me to complete. I wqnted to put it away many times, but forced myself to stay with it. It did redeem itself somewhat, but I can't say i enjoyed it. King seemed to be reaching for something but was unable to find the right words. I have lived through this era, also, and I found his characters to be unbelievable and boring. I had a hard time trying to remember Pete's name (hearts in atlantis) I'm not really sure what King's message was in the book. It was plodding and overdone. king's writing has usually been entertaining and well paced. This was not the case in this try. His voice so strong that it is a distraction. In his effort to try for a depth in his writing he seems to have lost his way and wallows around in verbosity. I'm sorry I wasted my precious summer reading time on this one."
1,I THINK KING PHONED THIS DUD IN.,"Nothing much happens in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS during the 60 pages I read. I have a life, and 60 pages is all I plan to invest in this door-stop.I suspect King forgot how to write horror/thrillers when he was hanging out with Peter Straub. Stevie? Get with Thomas Harris for a refresher course.But I love King's first books."
1,This was a Stephen King Book?,This story started out with promise with Low Men In Yellow Coats. After that it quickly loses steam. When I buy a Stephen King book I expect to be frightened if not that at least to be entertained. This book did not fufill either desire. I am dissapointed that King did this to his fans who expect a lot more out of him. I wonder if he thinks because he is so succesful that he can just crank out anything he wants and people will just lap it up. Mr King please stick to horror what your good at if I want to read about the sixties I'll read a history book.
5,Stephen K. at his Best!,"This was a very easy read.Even though I read it more than 4 months ago, I can remember every page. You really get to know the characters and bond with them. This is great for a vacation or a few nights of bad weather. Get it, Read it, Enjoy!"
4,Engrossing,"I hate parroting what sounds like a jacket blurb (in fact, it may have been a blurb), but after reading this book, I had to say ""Wow... I never knew King could write this well."" I stopped reading King several books back after a growing feeling that the narrators may be changing but the voice stayed the same; in other words, a feeling of commercialism and formulaic writing. With this book, King steps over into the arena of literature, not merely popular fiction."
4,Pretty darn good I'd say,"I would have to say ""Good Job"" if I saw Stephen King right now. I really enjoyed the novel. It was full of great writing and characters and it was one of the best by him I have ever read. Being only 16 years old, I can really relate to the Vietnam War through this book. I was really fascinated by how much effect the war really had, even after it was long over. Out of the 5 stories, I would say that ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" was the best. God, I love King's characters. I don't think anyone can do characters as good as he can. Also, the ""Blind Willie"" one was actually quite funny. Even though he was not a blind man, he was still a Vietnam vet and the book kind of portrayed it like he had a RIGHT to beg. I thought that was very interesting."
5,A must read,"A Must ReadThe book Hearts in Atlantis is a must read. It's a book about a boy named Bobby Garfield and his Meeting of and old man named Ted, a Yankees fan from out of town who had just moved in to his apartment building. Ted is on the run from the ""low men in yellow coats."" But Mrs. Garfield (Bobby's mom) is becoming an alcoholic/heavy smoker and starting to be a real witch. She is putting a lot of resistance on Ted's ""journey.""Meanwhile bobby has problems of his own. His main problem is three bullies from St. Gibe's catholic school. In the middle of the story the three boys do something to Carol that makes Bobby's mom expect Ted has done something to Carol. Then there is a big scene in the Garfield apartment.I haven't finished the whole book yet but so far Stephen Kings novel Hearts in Atlantis is one of the best books I have ever read and I hope the rest of the stories are as good as the first half."
3,not my favorite but worth a read,"Of Stephen King's novels, this is not one of my favorites.. He does well to make you feel you are with him through the stories, but I felt little sympathy for any of the characters but Bobbie & Ted in the ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" and would have prefered the story to stick with Bobbie & Ted.. I also felt as if King may have gotten tired of his characters toward the end as the sections kept getting shorter & shorter.. Was there really nothing else left to say at the end or was there a deadline looming on SK's calendar?? What happens next to Bobby and Carol??My favorites btw, were: The Stand, Needful Things, Four Past Midnight (Library Police)and Dolores Claiborne. The last made a great book & a pretty great film.. I *do* plan to see the movie adaptation of Hearts in Atlantis & look forward to seeing what the amazing Anthony Hopkins does with his portrayl of Ted.. =)"
4,Dark Tower reference,"I read this book straight after finishing the Dark Tower series, and fortunately for me, it did quell the withdrawal symptoms I found myself with after finally emerging from King's amazing adventure.In short - I thoroughly enjoyed it.It took me once again out of the square and allowed my mind to journey on a similar kind of path as did the Dark Tower books.In all honesty - Can anyone go wrong with ANY King title.Read it - you'll love it."
5,Worth the Drive,"This book is actually the first King novel I have ""read"" and I love it! I have even sat in my driveway for several minutes to finish listening to a chapter. This book will shorten any commute!"
3,You'll shed a few tears of nostalgia if you're 50+ !,"I want more! I want to know what happened to Bobby and into what world did Ted escape. I want a reunion.... While the remainder of the tale(s) were definitely ""thought provoking,"" (and the obession for playing Hearts a bit tedious), they paled compared to the adventures of Bobby and his friends and the great character development in that story. I think I went to school with some of those people. Thanks, again, Mr. King for making the daily commute something I look forward to instead of dreading."
4,Ted is back..,"Ted's adventures as briefly described in the Dark Tower series.Yay! Great read, lots of 60's references."
3,Interesting read,"I decided that it had been too long since I had read a King book so I picked this one out of my large pile of books and had at it.I was drawn in by the characters, which from my perspective is a natural King writing style.The first third is what I have come to expect of the author but the remaining 2/3's was not. The tie in was great...the story line was as good as ever but I just did not expect what I got out of the book.Well written, as you'd expect. Twists and turns...mostly predictable King. But the final twist in my opinion was the lack of a ""King twist"".I give it a 3 out of 5 only because I love Kings style and the ease of the reading"
4,"Story Great, William Hurt was awful!",I loved this story but I couldn't stand William Hurt reading the Book on Tape. I don't understand why another reviewer said he was so good. He was so monotone and he constantly emphasized the wrong parts of the sentences. He rambled on and on without taking a breath; I couldn't tell where one sentence ended and the next began. He didn't change the voices for the characters like a good reader does. He was the worst reader I have ever heard and I have listened to quite a few books on tape!
4,Hearts in Atlantis - Great stories with a common thread,"""Hearts in Atlantis"" starts with the childhood memories of an eleven year old. As King writes of the friendship that develops with an adult, it is done in a way that touches the heart.As a fan of the Dark Tower series, the references to the the 'Beam' and other things from that series certainly left me thinking (and hoping) that we will see more of Ted Braughtigan, the adult the youngster befriends.The second story, set a few years later in the Freshmen college years during the era of the Viet Nam war also brought powerful memories back.This book may not be a favorite for all King fans. It is not steeped in the grim tension that is felt in some of the stories that has made the author popular. But certainly, anyone growing up in the 60's and 70' would have a difficult time not getting something from this book."
1,What happened to the old Stephen King,"Is there any way to give less than 1 star? King used to be fun (and spooky) to read. Not so anymore! It seems as if he's used it all up and is now selling us political diatribe under his name. I will buy no more King ""stuff"" nor will I read anymore until he returns to what got him where he is."
1,My heart just wasn't in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS!,"Hey! What happened to King? This story made no sense. It failed to connect the Regulators and the Dark Tower, which apparently was the only reason I could see for Mr. King having wanted to have written this book.Trivial story, problems and characters made this a waste of time. I'm glad I borrowed this book, like all his others since GERALD'S GAME (another annoyingly stupid story), from the library. Boring."
3,A BOOK THAT COULD BE GOOD,"The story line of the novel was ok, but some of the language was totally unnecessary. . .I belive authors can make the same point still using decency and tack, thus touching even a larger audience.If you really want to read a book that will keep your interest all the way through, based on a very erotic but totally clean and beuatiful love relationship. ..read Stolen Mometns by Barbara Jeanne Fisher.. .It is the most beautiful love story ever, you fall in love with each character, and this is a book you will always want to keep and read again and again... I makes eavh reader know for sure that life and love are ever so precious and never to be taken for granted . ..try it you will love it..."
2,"DEPRESSING, ALL OVER THE MAP","I like Stephen King but I couldn't recommend this book to anyone. The first part is alright but it really leaves you hanging. I don't know if S.K. was trying to write ""The Great American Novel"" but he sure did jump around a lot. You will not come out of this book with a good feeling. King's short stories are great. When I finish them I wish that there was one more in the book. Hearts in Atlantis is one weird compilation."
2,dissapointed,"As a big king fan I was shocked how bad this book was. I really wanted to like it but I started, put it down, started, put it down.... All that vietnam stuff bores me to hell and the story is not even entertaining. I wish he would write books like ""salems lot or my alltime favorite it... again.. those books were entertaining, easy to read and scary as hell. maybe it is time for king to retire. if you can not produce anymore step away with grace..."
2,A real dissapointment,"I'm beginning to wonder if King is imitating Bag of Bones' Mike Noonan's technique for writer's block, publishing older books stored for rainy days. In this case, before King knew how to write INTERESTING books. With this book, take King's own advice, ""read the first ten per cent...if it isn't giving more than it's taking by then, put it aside."" After 52 pages you will be reading a different book."
3,Starts out good but then it's a fight....,"This book starts out really good but severly drops off at then end. I do kind of like how he showed how different people's lives intertwined based on 60's events but overall I think the book lacked. I think if he just would have stayed with the characters in the begining and not gotten into the side stories it would have been a much better book. However I am sure any who grew up in the 60's would probably really like this book, myself on the other hand did not."
2,Definetely not the best by King.,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. None of the stories really caught my attention, and none of them was interesting enough to make me rush through the pages, like many other Stephen King books did. The first story, ""Low men in yellow coats"" is the best one, but only because of its link with the Dark Tower series. Someone who doesn't know those books won't find it as appealing. As for ""Hearts in Atlantis"", is also a little bit interesting, but it doesn't justify its excessive length. The same thing happens with ""Blind Willie"". As for the two final stories, ""Why we're on Vietnam"" and ""Heavenly Shades of Night are falling"", well... they just bore me to death. I guess even the King can fail sometimes. Better luck on the next book, Stevie."
4,Helping me to understand my Step Dad,"Hearts in Atlantis is a book that every slacker college student should read. For me, you could substitute playing hearts for playing Quake II. Mr. King does a wonderful job painting a picture that relates to today's young adults seemlessly. So you mean to tell me that the baby boomers once felt as rebelious as the youth of today? I guess the seed really doesn't fall that far from the tree. These stories are engaging and provocative, provided you can open your head to the concept of the Dark Tower for one of them."
2,Come again?,"This book appears to be a collection of three different, although intermixing stories and each was written from a different view (first person, third person, ect.). It's mostly confusing with the switching of perspectives and sometimes annoyingly slow. It refers to ""The Dark Tower,"" which is another of Stephen King's work, remarkably often with no real direct information. So, unless you read ""The Dark Tower,"" you'll be pretty lost when it comes to the mentioning of the ""blood red rose petals,"" and the ""beams."" Finally, the ending is terrible. It's so abrupt and empty that for a second I thought pages were missing, surely there would be more - but there isn't. It would be wonderful for a sequel but that's something this book just doesn't deserve."
2,maybe my expectations were too high.....,"The book began as classic king, with that fascinating descriptive writing I just plain adore.... then proceeded quickly into a kind of rambling and disjointed tale. maybe I was expecting too much? By the end of the book I was wondering if I was dumb because I did not get it, or if the story was just too loosely thrown together. I long for the days of king's novels such as The Stand but, alas, those days are gone for good, it seems. Let's hope he tries again soon.... he is still the best writer alive!"
3,interesting stories...........,ok first of all i dint understnad the story properly with all tht regulaotrs thing...........i hate the fact that i have to read KING's another book to really understan this book.......which almost felt like a WASTE of time....but none the less the story still holds its grounds..........the segments and stories of many people are interesting and specially the one with the BLIND GUY.........none the less it isnt KIngs Bad book......its actually pretty Good if u can just see past its Regulators thing........but none the less KING is able to creat strangeness in his stories and still keep it believable........3/5
2,Hearts in Atlantis,"Stephen King is a fine, talented author, but Hearts in Atlantis was not my favorite. A few of the segments were good reading, but I found myself skipping over pages...the book held little interest for me. Bag of Bones was excellent; one of his best."
1,I almost gave up half-way through,"I have never before almost given up on a SK book, however, Hearts in Atlantis almost did it for me. Honestly, I am wondering what has happened to the old Stephen King style. In Hearts in Atlantis we are introduced to drivel such as ""cars that aren't really cars"" but evil entities, more mind-reading and other non-scary, non-compelling ideas. My next Stephen King book will be borrowed from the library and purchased only if I have had an enjoyable reading experience. My favorite book is still Misery, a book that is horrifying because it is something that could truly happen."
2,"Well, the first story was good......","don't get me wrong, i love SK. but this book sucks. the first story ""low men in yellow coats"" was great, but that was a result of the connection to the Dark Tower series which i LOVE. wizard and glass was one of SK's best books ever! but this book went downhill after low men. i do appreciate SK's attempt at literary acceptance, or whatever it is he wants. but i miss the old, big, huge, monster books he wrote. ones with plots, many characters that you know better than you own parents, etc. hell, the green mile was one of the greater books of the 90's, and different seasons was an excellent collection of stories. if those cannot grant literary acceptance, then SK will be hard pressed to write something that will. and if he outdose those books, i'll be in heaven enjoying every word. SK, finish the Dark Tower! and get well soon!"
5,The Best Stephen King Book Ever!,"This is truly the best Stephen King book ever ( The Stand, It, and Bag of Bones are next ). The first and last stories are by far the best but the rest of the stories are excellent also. Don't be fooled by those who say this isn't Stephen King. This book proves who Stephen King actually is: a gifted stroyteller."
5,Incredible,"In my opinion, this is Mr. King's best novel in years. It started a bit slowly, and I was a little worried that it might not be a very good read. However, that turned around quickly, and I found myself completely engrossed and couldn't put the book down. Should be a classic because it's fantastic."
4,This is the SK I love.,"I bought this book without reading reviews or summaries, and I was pleasantly surprised. I was so excited to read the first story since it ties into the Dark Tower series. The characters are well-developed and I love the way he ties them together. SK has an amazing ability to tell stories when he's not caught up in gruesome detail. I really enjoyed this one."
4,A journey worth taking,"My husband is a huge Stephan King fan and finally talked me into reading one of his books. He chose Hearts in Atlantis for me because it is his favorite. It's not what I consider a typical ""Stephan King book"" because it is not horror or scary, but does have a touch of sci-fi. The book is broken into pieces, each focusing on a different character, the last of which is focused back on the first character to tie things together. It is a very interesting story, some sections more exciting than others. I still do not fully understand it, but I'm not sure the reader is meant to. It is certainly worth a read."
4,Still wondering....,"I was looking forward to seeing the movie and I thought I should read the book first. Now, I am not so sure. I had no idea what the book was about going in and I am still wondering. My advice, realize ahead of time that these are ""stand alone"" stories. It is true that some of the characters make more than one appearance. However, the tales could have been told without that. I feel that I would have enjoyed the stories more had I realized this wasn't one novel, but a collection of short stories. I kept wondering what the low men were and when they were going to show up again which distracted me througout the rest of the book. I did enjoy the writing and that is why I gave 4 stars. I found the Vietnam stories especially engaging."
3,Compelling and suspenseful.,"Hearts in Atlantis isn't the best thing King's ever written. It's also not that bad either, and still delivers a fair bit of suspense and social commentary to the reader. It's a compendium of short stories, and the best of the stories is 'Low Men in Yellow Coats'. It focuses on the travails of Bobby, an impressionable young boy, and his exposure to the morally corrupted real world. The rest of the book isn't that great, but fans of King should definitely have a look."
1,HEARTS shows little heart here for me.,"I love Stephen King and I can appreciate when he writes a ""non-horror"" novel -- Hell, I enjoyed EYES OF THE DRAGON -- but HEARTS IN ATLANTIS just didn't do it for me. As per the book jacket, there is no mention that it is made up of several short stories that don't really connect so I kept waiting for the pay-off. Also, I didn't read THE DARK TOWER series (which the Men in Yellow Coats section pertains to) so I didn't ""get"" the significance of their existence in the book. I don't want to trash this prolific author because of his importance in American literature and because of his humility when talking about his own level of writing. King knows he's not the best and I admire that. And someone who has written as many novels as he has is surely allowed a ""stinker"" every now and then ... I just think this is one of them. I don't believe (as some do) he's lost his touch, because BAG OF BONES was truly a great read. Here's hoping his next one is better."
1,Hearts of Atlantis,"Another ""wordy"" King book. The first part was ok but nothing else happens that would warrant all these pages/words. The stories are related, but big deal, they go nowhwere. I wonder at how King can come up with excellent stories (Shawshank, Misery, Needful Things, The Stand to name a few) and then come out with wordy go nowwhere stories. I've started to check him out of the library before I invest...not something I use to do with King."
1,Starts out good but....,I have read several of Stephen King's books and was anxious to read this one. I found the beginning to be pretty interesting. The story about the boy and the men in yellow coats and the interesting new neighbor were pretty good. I just kept waiting for something exciting to happen and it never did. The last half of the book seemed to really drag. I was waiting for Bobby to walk in somewhere. It was almost 4 totally different books combined. It just seemed to drag on forever. I never really got into this book.
4,A wonderful group of interrelated stories.,"I have been a King fan for many years, and have enjoyed all his books. This one is no exception. I enjoyed the way he tied the Dark Tower into the first story. The other stories, while not having elements of horror like ""Low Men"" were well written and following the characters through the years was interesting. I hope to see Ted again in the Dark Tower series."
5,I loved this book.,"The book was delivered on Wednesday, and the entire household had to wait for me to finish it. I simply loved it. Thank you, Mr. King."
5,Great Use of Words and Images,"What really sets this book apart from many others is the wonderful use of language and image. The evocative idea of ""Low Men in Yellow Coats""...by itself is almost silly and certainly not scary, but as it is repeated with added bits of observation, it becomes ominous.King has always excelled at taking the everyday and spinning it just slightly to where it takes on more meaning than it should have. He achieves that agian with this collection."
2,Very Disappointing for a Stephen King Book....,"I enjoy reading Stephen King and was very pleased to receive this book as a gift for my birthday. Right away I bonded with the main character Bobby and then Ted, the old man who befriends him. What a delightful story full of imagination with a little bit of real life thrown in this was. I was very disappointed to get 322 pages into Bobby's ""adventurous"" life only to be taken away to a college where all the guy (who was not related to Bobby but knew Carol) did was play cards for 300 pages! I never read the back of the book first so I had no idea this was three stories in one. The third short story took us back to a grown up Bobby but it just wasn't enough to draw me back into the book and I can't get over how poorly it ended. Buy it for the first story if you enjoy Kings books and skip the second chapter unless you're still in college and can possibly relate to whatever is happening for those 300 pages."
4,Much better than the recent failings...,"...in which King weaves a unique tale that is four tales in itself. He takes the general themes that made up the sixties and spins a tale around each of them, questioning Viet-Nam while making fun of the senseless patriotism of the era. Besides, the first story of the book; ""Low Men in Yellow Coats"" is the latest add-on The Dark Tower chronicle, writen in a much different style that deliciously resembles ""It"", albeit in a milder way. Maybe Blind Willie should have been left out, but that makes up for a gap in the overall story. Read...you'll not be disappointed."
4,Another Link to the Dark Tower Series,"People that typecast Stephen King as a horror author obviously have not read 'Hearts in Atlantis'. As the writings of Stephen King progress over time we learn that there is much more to the genius than just haunted hotels, and demonic automobiles. 'Hearts in Atlantis' is a fantastic read for those looking for just a story, but furthermore it is another ""link"" in Stephen King's 'Dark Tower' series.Those who came of age in the sixties, lived in the turbulent seventies, and faced reality in the eighties will definately enjoy this book. Everyone else who reads this will transcend time and become apart of atmosphere represented in this magnificent story.A definate must read for all fans of fiction."
4,Not typical King,"While this was far from my favorite King reading, I enjoyed the 5 stories that King combines in Hearts in Atlantis. It was quite different from the majority of his horror novels, comparable to such works as Shawshank Redemption, but perhaps that is what makes it so interesting. The story itself is slippery, quite cunning in fact, and I found myself unable to grasp it. Everytime I thought I had a handle on the events and could predict what would arise with the turn of a page, the story would take a turn and slide out of my hands. A wonderful book to take on vacation of for a weekend read."
5,Grownup King,"With this book, Stephen King takes a step away from the unmitigated gore that, while entertaining, can become repetitive. ""Hearts in Atlantis"" is simply a good story, told with sympathy, an almost nostalgic attention to detail, and his typical, down-to-earth language and humour. While reading the Dark Tower series would make the first chapter more accessible, I haven't read them and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope we can expect more novels like this. Stephen King is obviously a gifted storyteller, even without resorting to his trademark horror genre."
2,"Great writing, boring story","Starts out great and then gets progressively bad, just like many other King books. (Remember the awful endings to Needful Things and Tom Gordon)? Also, it seems as though King is starting to recycle material--the relationship between Bobby and Ted is remarkably similar to that of the young boy and former Nazi in ""Apt Pupil,"" one of King's best stories. Anyway, King should leave the Vietnam stuff to Tim O'Brien, a writer who was actually there. (Incidentally, he's also a MUCH better writer than King.) I have read almost every King book, but this one is mediocre at best."
4,Born in the 70's but loved King's 60's,"Being born in the 70's, I do not have a personal reference of what the 60's were like. But King painted a detailed and emotional portrait of what it may have been like. ""Hearts"" differs from the usual King story in that it is not a horror novel but a story of life and the termoil that individuals of a common beginning go through."
3,Stick with the written version,"I am on the last tape of the audio version of this book (16 grueling tapes in all). Half of the book is read by Stephen King (who is great) and the other half by William Hurt. Hurt has cut into my enjoyment of the book - his voice is arrogant (similar to his movie persona - think Altered States), he uses pauses where they don't belong (example: ""the sense of the world as a (pause) thin (pause) veneer, (pause) stretched over something else""), lets words trail off, and in short - does not sound like the main character in the book at all!In addition, there is a gross overuse of swear words in the last third of this book. They are tedious to listen to and subtract considerably from the story. I have found that later works of Stephen King tend to disintegrate into garbage about halfway through - but I continue to hope for redemption, since his earlier works were so stellar.If you're going to get this, get the printed book and not the audio version!"
3,A Surprisingly Awful Book,"Obviously from the German style of fairy tales, this book is beautifully illustrated, but somewhat horrifying for adult sensibilities. Children, however, did not seem nearly as horrified as the adults who read this book, suggesting the pictures of Madeline burning alive in her apartment was just part of the moral for them. An interesting read although not one I could wholeheartedly recommend to be read to children."
3,Train without Tutt,"I have been a fan of Train's Ephraim Tutt since I was a boy fifty years ago. I read this tale about five years ago. This is the story of an extremely shady lawyer in the bad old days. As you can see, not much of the story stuck to me, but it was an enjoyable read. Read the Tutt stories first."
3,Good Frequency-Bad Mouse,"The Versapoint Rf Wireless Keyboard full Function Keyboard with builtin is good ,but HIGH price,and BAD mouse, it's very complicated."
4,Good Buy,I had a little trouble finding the right driver to work with my computer. I found some downloadalbe drivers on the manufactor's website.This was a great tool for me. I bought this to use at home. What a relief to be free of wires. It makes imputing information and searching the web much more comfortable.
3,So-so,"I don't speak German, but I did see the Disney movie, and, while I didn't like what they did with the story, I did think Menken's score is very good. I read a synopsis of this staged version, so as to know how it's different from the cartoon, and was still not impressed. As for the quality of this CD: some important songs like ""Out There"" (or ""Draussen"" on this CD) have no magic whatsoever in them, and are performed with little to no feeling. I would call it -mediocre- next to some other truly great Disney hits."
5,Incredibly helpful,"I have used this book for some time with a range of undergraduates at UC Berkeley. Several of my colleagues use it as well. It is a very helpful, practical introduction to real-world research, the most useful book we have found on the subject. It helps students and researchers understand the processes of interviewing, making field notes, and collecting and recording data. The style is very accessible. Students who have found it useful for other classes include those studying sociology, anthropology, fiction, advanced nonfiction, and ethnic studies.Read in combination with some complex books of ethnography, including Clifford Geertz, for example, it can provide the structure to help students understand the concept of fieldwork.I highly recommend taking a look at this one."
2,it okay..,"the content of this book is ridiculously dry. I mean, I could not fully get through a single chapter in this book because I could not stay awake and my quiz grades in class definitely reflected that. Some of the stories in the book used as examples were fun to read sometimes, but then the author would dissect that piece by piece to point that I just wanted to throw the book away from me..."
3,Price,I'm very upset with this book. I just bought it for my class last week for 35.52 and then I go back to view the book again and the book is eleven dollars cheaper. This makes me upset because I could have gotten the book cheaper.
3,Probably Not the Best Book Out There,"Overall, I would say this book is not the best. I have not thoroughly reviewed fieldworking textbooks, but I found this one to be a little dry, and I am not a fan of the author either. There is something about her voice that is irking. The only plus that I would give this book is that there are a lot of examples of different ways to write a fieldworking paper. As a person who has never written one, I found these helpful because I was able to compare my voice and style to those of the authors' students. If you can find this in another book, however, go with the other one. This book is just okay."
4,a must -see,"Collection of quite many animation shorts, all made in a different style, like a 'box of chocolate', you never know what you get next and that's what makes it brilliant. Some of them are too long but that's ok when there's always the next one to look forward to. A few of them are real gems full concepts never seen before."
2,Boiler Room Manics,"The primary view of this book is based on the premise that you do not know anything about Steam and Distribution systems. If this is the case, and you would like to learn more, purchase this title. If not, there is very little that this book has to offer that can not be learned in a strict boiler room atmosphere. Some of the Optimization ideas are valid and can be considered helpful, to some."
1,A reader,"Contrary to other readers I found the author erred by concentrating on one of the participants at Lang Vei, namely, Lt. Longgrear, who had come so lately to the camp and knew nothing of the background or of the Green Berets involved in the history of the camp.Parts of the author's descriptions of certain events contrast sharply with those of the Team Sargeant, William T. Craig, who was not trapped in the Command Bunker but was on the run outside the Bunker, along with several other Green Berets.The author digresses repeatedly without making the effort to complete the subject matter thoroughly.The book gives the reader only part of the story, however, as so many years have passed, it is no doubt impossible to ascertain what and why this particular event is still such a mystery."
3,Brave men in Combat,"I didn't care for this book. Although I have read many account of the Vietnam War, this one just didn't hold my interest. I was barley able to finish it. My opinion is certainly no reflection on the bravery and sacrifice of the men involved. I am talking literally style only. To the pure war enthusiast this book has genuine merit. It tells the story of brave men in combat and honors their memory with respect. We owe them a lot."
3,Lang Vei-,"A good account of the destruction of a base that should have been evacuated months before, it offered absolutly no tactical advantage. With the Marines holding the key hills with undermanned companies, it would have been impossible to reinforce the outpost without weakening another outpost, perhaps that was the hope of the North Viets. Gen. Westmorland, ""the king of blunders"", should have pulled the SF team out months before as well as the Marines holding the Khe Sanh and the surrounding hills. Or perhaps reinforced with units of the Air Cav that arrived at LZ Stud soon after the outpost was destroyed. The book is well writtten."
5,music CD,It was a gift to relative in another state. As I understand their response it played just fine and the music wasn't bad either.
3,Average at Best,The first book we received had two Table of Contents and the first 17 pages of the text were missing.Overall content wasn't much better.
5,Needed for class,I needed this book for class. I was very pleased to find the price because it was cheaper than our university bookstore. Book came exactly as it was described online.
4,Reader Friendly,This is a good text for those studying to be a counselor. It is more reader friendly than other books about assessment and generally describes terms in an easy-to-understand format.
5,A well written account of an interesting battle.,"I've read this book more times than I can count. To me, that's the highest praise I can give. Eisenhower (the author) writes as an historian ought to, with no axes to grind in describing Montgomery's actions, etc. His firsthand knowledge of Army ways and wherefores holds him in good stead: the reader is being shepherded through the material by one in the know who always provides a down-to-earth rational perspective. The story he tells stands on its own as, alternately, a mystery, an excellent character study of the participants (particularly the commanders), and an exciting tale of an event that represented, in my mind, the climatic event of World War II in the European Theater."
5,One of the best books on the Ardennes Offensive,"After reading a recent novel The Commodore, by John LoweThe CommodoreI have once again picked this book up along with others. The ""novel"" The Commodore, which criticises Montgomery along with the Mediterranean campaign as it champions ROUNDUP from an intelligence officer's point of view, culminated with the lead-up to The Battle of The Bulge. It did this in such a way as I have not yet seen written that it brought me back to this detailed book which I consider one of the top two books on the subject and the second one is not by Ambrose. It is an experience when a novel can get you back to research for a second view or to great books such as this one."
2,"Usually love Karen Katz, but this was disappointing!","We love Karen Katz books! Our 18m old has enjoyed all of the lift-flap-books from a very early age. Plus, who can resist ""Counting Kisses""?That being said... this book is disappointing! My child has many lift-the-flap books and she's gentle with every one of them.On the very first page, the arm ""swings"" to point to a nose and my child always expects it to fold open like all other flap books (it's barely hanging on now). The next page has 10 toes that ""wiggle"", but the flaps are so tiny they are impossible for little fingers to pry up (do we expect our toddlers to use their fingernails?). The ""pull the ears"" page is the most ridiculous. The mechanism makes it look like there's a flap under the baby's chin, so of course, my child lifted that flap and proceeded to tear the page by accident.I'm definitely a proponent of children learning new motor skills, but this wasn't what I had in mind during storytime!"
3,"Cute book, but poor construction","I love all of Karen Katz's books, but this one gave us problems. The first time we read it, the pivoting arm broke. Now we have to come up with a rivet to fit the joint. Not the most pratical book to have around babies or small children."
3,Not her best,"My daughter is two years old and has an abundance of Karen Katz books, all of which she loves and asks to read frequently. We recently bought ""Wiggle Your Toes"" and I was slightly disappointed by it, mainly because it seemed geared towards a child older than two. As is typical in Katz's books, each page has some sort of hands-on flap or tactile item; however, several of them are not as easy to manipulate as the simple flaps in many of her other books. Within the first hour of owning the book, my daughter had ripped off the movable arm on the first page, and within a week or so had also ripped the 3-D arm on the last page of the book. She hadn't been rough with the flaps in the book but it seems they are better suited for an older child who can move them more smoothly and easily. On the other hand, she still enjoys this book and asks me to read it, so I think in the eyes of a child, this book is still a good read."
3,Mis-lead,"My only complaint is that the item was listed as ""new"" however there was definate wear and one of the moveable parts had a little damage to it."
5,I ADORE NUTELLA,"Simply put...people love it or hate it. I loveeee Nutella! I put it on bread, Ritz Crackers, Animal Crackers, Rice Cakes and just eat it straight from a spoon on its own! It can be taken anywhere and doesn't require refrigeration. I suggest ""icing"" yellow cupcakes with it! Delish treat! I think everyone should try Nutella once in their life. Its amazing amazing AMAZING!!!!!!"
4,as expected,"Shipped quickly and product was as expected. I recommend this product. With vanilla wafers it is great with kids, both big and small."
5,"Delicious, but","Love the product, but it came in a container that read ""...part of a multipack; not to be sold separetely,"" and the inside seal didn't seem sealed when I opened the lid (came off very easily, when I opened for the first time). But product is apparently perfectly fine. Dangerously delicious :)"
1,Bad Handling,"Just received this in my package today and it was already opened for me and spilled out on the box. When I opened the box up, the air protector bags were just sitting on top of all the items instead of filling in the space between so the nutella was just rocking around the whole time. I'm sure it would have been delicious, but now I'd rather just get in my car and buy this elsewhere then to have it come again in bad packaging and handling."
5,How do you do Nutella?,"I toast a cinnamon raisin bagel, slather with peanut butter, add Nutella all around but just along the outside edge... ahhh- heavenly! A little bit of Nutella goes a long way. I'm going to donate my unopened jar of grape Jelly to a food pantry... it's never going to be opened as long as I have Nutella in the house."
5,Nutella,"I bought this to send to my boyfriend, who loves Nutella, and will eat it with pretty much anything, including garlic bread, no joke. He claims that it is good.Apparently, this is a monstrous size. I'm sure he's almost done with it by now."
4,Simple and Easy,This book appears simple and also shows a multitude of sall activities that students who are beginners in the world of video production (and range from 15-20 yrs) can cover easily. It makes Video production look fun and easy and also has nice large lettering to read and simple projects to do.
3,Influential but tedious,"One of the most influential books in art history, The Life of Forms in Art is nonetheless horribly tedious. It was originally written in French, which is reportedly much more lucid. However, if your background in art historical study is strong, it is imperative that you understand Focillon's thesis. But I must tell you, I am a first year undergraduate at Yale, and I had to read it three times before some degree of understanding crept in; my graduate student TA read it twice! Enjoy!"
4,The most real-looking Allosaurus,"After seeing this remarkably-modeled beast, I was shocked at the crude-looking, sensationalist competition. True, this one doesn't bare nasty fangs (there are protruding, painted teeth that get the message across) or wave exaggerated claws: it simply looks like the real thing contemplating his next meal.The others not only have features I've never seen on a scientific reconstuction of Allosaurus, but bear dumb-looking expressions and awkward poses. This guy really looks like the serenely confident top predator, the ""king of the beasts"" of the day.Some will complain of the small size compared to some dinosaur models, but make no mistake: this is the real deal!"
2,GOTTA SEE THIS,"I heartily recommend this turkey to anyone who is looking for a really good laugh -- or ten thousand of them. The script, acting, musical numbers, concept, etc. etc. etc. are so bottom-rate you find yourself trying to breathe through your guffaws. Sylvester Stallone must have thought he had a no-brainer hit here; just goes to show you it take more than a good original source to create something of quality -- though this movie does feature an excellent performance by Cynthia Rhodes, who manages to be nearly moving in a movie that has no heart, and is perhaps the only legitimate dancer and singer in a movie about singers/dancers. The finale, a Broadway musical called SATAN'S ALLEY, is one of those perfectly terrible depictions of Broadway=esque stuff in the movies, and is incoherent -- what EXACTLY is it about? Enjoy the madness."
4,"Not as timeless as ""Saturday Night Fever"" but definitely worth a look!","It's not Saturday Night Fever; it's not a timepiece and it doesn't have a storyline that is quite as intense. And the music, although catchy and even well written at points, cannot match the brilliance of SNF's.That said, this movie is an excellent follow-up that takes Tony Manero in a new direction, where he gets ""his"" and grows as a result. I always thought this movie was a great companion to SNF and, if taken on its own, holds up decently well. In addition, there is some incredible dancing that is just plain fun to watch.Give it an open-minded look and you will not be disappointed."
2,"Cheese, But Not Tasty Cheese",There's a fine line between brilliance and cheese.Saturday Night Fever (30th Anniversary Special Collector's Edition)was on one side; Staying Alive is on the other. Fast forward through the first half of this movie and then watch the dancing.
1,Very funny in the wrong way.,"I saw this movie in the theatre back in 1983. At the time I thought it was the kitschiest film ever made. The costumes, and dance sequences were laughable and looked absurd even by 80's standards. Travolta had just been involved with a couple of flops (the romance movie with the wonderful Lily Tomlin, which I cannot remember the title) and I thought this would be the last we would see of him. I was wrong and to his credit he has had staying power. If you want a good laugh at a very goofy movie in which the dance scenes look more like one of today's WWF matches or the strange love child of the later Rocky movies and Zanadu."
1,Pathetic,"Pathetic. That is the only word I can use to describe this film. The writing left a lot to be desired, particularly any real link to the original film, ""Saturday Night Fever"". In addition, the dancing was completely unprofessional and a disgrace to anyone who has ever been a dancer. Unless you are really interested in seeing John Travolta in a leotard, I wouldn't recommend you waste your time with this one."
1,poor follow up,this movie was a precurssor to perfect an equal wack piece of film.and both almost cost travolta his film career.this was a broadway play that should have been canned before it started.
2,Not Good Enough to be A Guilty Pleasure,"Oiy! What was Travolta to do? People were clammering for a sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever."" Honest, they were. Someone got the great idea of letting Sylvester Stallone write and direct this project. What came out of this mess was a hit single ""Far From Over,"" which strangely enough came from a struggling singer named Frank Stallone. Any relation? You betcha! Travolta went through a great workout and had a sculpted body. I guess it was Rambo: the Musical. The sloppy story is predictable, and the finale production number makes ""Showgirls"" finale an outstandiong piece of theater. This could have been more. Fever was the ultimate film of the 1970s. What this is simply a complete waste of talent. The score, some songs by the Bee Gees, is even disappointing. Maybe it should be retitled, ""Saturday Night Sickness."" Sooo lame."
3,Travolta Memories,"I first saw this film when it was first released in England. I know the story line is non-existent and tacky, but the dancing was so amazing - JT at his best - and Cynthia Rhodes (who I had not seen before) was so lovely (good voice, great dancer) that it more than made up for it. My daughter recently saw a re-run of Grease but doesn't think that JT can dance!!! This video will certainly change her mind. Excellent for all John Travolta fans who want a bit of fun without having to think too hard."
3,C'mon it's quite watchable!,"Staying Alive is simply a ""good bad movie"". It's silly, its campy, and it's a lot of fun. Travolta gives another superb performance as Tony Manero, only this Tony is less of a hood as he was in Saturday Night Fever. The film is corny and predidable sequel to the FAR SUPERIOR Saturday Night Fever but the actors make it an enjoyable time spender."
1,A Camp Classic for the Ages,"John Travolta's Tony Manero struts from the Brooklyn disco to the Great White Way and becomes an opening-night sensation in this misbegotten sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever."" Written and directed by that paragon of dance cinema, Sylvester Stallone, ""Staying Alive"" (1983) exists in its own warped universe. You know things are wrong when the Bee Gees play second fiddle to Frank Stallone in the soundtrack department. Leaving no cliché unturned, Sly handles the backstage drama in predictable ""Rocky"" fashion. The climactic bump-and-grind production numbers look like MTV run amok. A well-lubricated Travolta gives it his best shot, but cannot overcome Stallone's ham-handed approach. Top acting honors belong to Steve Inwood as the dictatorial choreographer-director - in other words, a poor man's Bob Fosse. Come to think of it, you're better off watching ""All That Jazz."""
1,Charter member of the Unintentionally Funny Hall of Fame,"This movie is so bad it's HYSTERICAL... quite simply, Staying Alive is the best unintentionally funny film of all time (edging out also-rans like ""Cocktail"" and ""Duets""). The dance sequences alone are enough to have you doubled over with laughter. The musical finale (Satan's Alley - a ""musical trip through hell"") is so mind-numbingly bad it has to be seen to be believed. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who needs a good laugh."
3,Hey I thought it was a good Saturday Night Fever Sequel,In this 1983 Saturday Night Fever sequel film where the original phenomenon left off. It's where Tony Manero the disco dancer kingpin from Brooklyn played by John Travolta. Is set to face his next challenge destiny to become a broadway stage dancing star after six years of his new york boogie nightclub days there. It was directed by Sylvester Stallone star of the three Rocky movies and Lords of The Flatbush.Makes a brief cameo apperence here as the guy in sunglasses waling down the streets. At lease it's one of my favorite movies of all time!
1,Stayin' Alive...barely,"Saturday Night Fever is a classic, like it or not, but Stayin' Alive is a classic mistake. Of all the movies to make a sequel to, they had to pick the perfect snapshot of the 70's disco scene, 6 years later, and run it into the ground. The original had all the flare and excitement of the still-fresh era, and should have been left that way: fresh and exciting. Stayin' Alive bares no resemblance to the original other than the final scene and Tony's character. This movie takes the original and puts that special ""80's touch"" on it, turning the 2001 Odyssey into ""Cats"" and Tony Manero into ""Rambo."" You don't believe it? Look at the box! Did you look twice? I told you so. Stay away from Stayin' Alive, it will ruin your memories of Saturday Night Fever forever."
3,It was too much for me,"I saw this movie a couple of days ago and it was good, butit wouldn't be my favorite movie.After become king of the dancefloor in disco, Tony decides that he wants to be a dancer onBroadway.His girlfriend named Jackie is a dancer on Broadway anda beautiful singer at a bar.One day Jackie invites Tony to cometo one of the shows and when Tony watches the show he sets hiseyes on the beautiful prima Donna star named Laura.Tony findsLaura in her dressing room and ask her if she wanted to go andspend the day with him.After spending the whole day with LauraTony go's to see Jackie and she has no idea that Tony had beensleeping in Laura's bed.That's one reason why I don't really like this movie because Tony had been cheating on Jackie behind herback and dating and hanging out with other girls also behind herback.Well that's my verison of the movie and believe it or notI think you should see the movie!"
3,chaos princess,"I really wanted to like this movie more. Travolta is still the man Tony Monero, but I think the film lack the depth in the charcters that Saturday Night Fever. Travolta though can still shake what his mama gave him."
2,80's dribble with Sly behind the camera,"Uh...uh...like....watching you dance.....it's like watching...you know...like smoke rising.This is the dialogue you have to look forward to in `Staying Alive'. Sylvestor Stallone directs and Frank Stallone contributes to the soundtrack. Sly's cameo is nothing more than `sucker bumping' Travolta on a crowded New York street.Our hero learns that there is more to dancing on Broadway than jiggling around in a disco. If you can imagine taking the movie `Rocky' and flipping it on it's ear from a boxer to a dancer, than I need explain no more. The finale is laughable as he premiers on Broadway.***Of special note*** John Travolta is at his most muscular in this film. Slyvestor Stallone himself was his training coach at the gym."
3,STARS FOR CYNTHIA!!!!,"Although I tend to agree with most everyone about the storyline, I feel that Cynthia Rhodes, as Jackie, displayed a depth of talent that Stallone and Travolta could only dream of. Her dancing was as hot as the lead's (Finola Hughes) when she helps Travolta prep for the lead. Her singing has emotion and depth, and she displayed great acting ability. (Check out the scene where she walks away from John after he makes a date to meet with her, and then flirts with Finola Hughes as Cynthia walks around the corner. She stops and looks back pensively and without a word shows more emotional range in that look than Travolta does throughout the whole movie.) I agree with the reviewer who wonders why this gorgeous, talented actress has not had more success in the business than she has. Cynthia is the only reason why I watch this movie whenever it comes on."
5,Have always loved it. I guess that shows my age,Watched it back in the day...always loved it and can't find it anywhere in town. Any hints on where to buy it?
5,Love it!,This is one of my favorite movies and I have been looking for it for a long time! I am tickled to finally have it!
3,Good product - unclear description,(It was some time ago when I bought this instant video from Amazon but I'll try to remember)I wanted to watch Saturday Night Fever and looked for it on Amazon. They didn't have it but had the pack Saturday Night Fever AND Staying Alive. On the same page they had the button to buy the instant video of one of those or both - I wasn't entirely sure. I bought the instant video somehow assuming I would get Saturday Night Fever AND Staying Alive.BUT I only got Staying Alive. Not what I wanted but I enjoyed it.
3,An entertaining cable TV watch. Nothing else.,"I wouldn't recommend paying to see this in general. Its not great ,but its a million times better than Grease 2. If you have nothing else better to do, its a decent flick to see. I've seen it twice out of sheer Saturday mid-day boredom. Its entertaining, completely copies ""Saturday Night Fever"" minus everything that made it legendary. This time its a broadway show! Oh wow, way to step it up! Nothing special. It tries. Ultimately TNT should buy the rights because its only good for cable."
1,A PRODUCER WHO DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE!,Why couldn't the movie have been like Saturday Night Fever? They could have bought all the people that play in the first movie. Why did Sylester direct it? They should have had the first producer for Fever to direct STAYIN ALIVE.
4,Love it,"I love this movie, I have seen it about 50 times. I think it's better than Saturday Night Fever. You can't go wrong with John Travolta!"
3,staying alive,"i saw staying alive when it first came out, as a dancer myself i thought that john was awful, cythia rhodes was great and gorgeous may i add. the weird thing about this movie was when john left fiona's party to meet c.rhodes at the bar. what she said to john seemed to be talking to me. it was exactly what my girlfriend had said. it was like i was in the movie that's why i liked this movie. it reflcted my own life."
2,Not Buddy's Best,"I am a huge Buddy Guy fan and recently bought the CD. I was pretty much disappointed in it overall. The guitar tone and sound are not good. I would recommend buying ANY of his other works before this one, even if you're a big fan. My personal favorites include: Damn Right I've Got the Blues, Stone Crazy, BG and JW Play the Blues, Alone and Acoustic, Live: The Real Deal."
2,A disapointment,"I am an avid lover of books of photography and happened to find this one to be a bit of a disapointment. I would not recommend it for the average photography enthusiast, however if you are interested in warfare you might enjoy this book. It is the type, however, that I would suggest borrowing from the library before purchasing."
5,Bomfunk Mc's Rules,"Freestyler, B-boys And Flygirls, Uprocking Beats, Rock Rocking Tha Spot and Rocking Just To Make You Move are the best. I love those songs! Bomfunk Mc's is the best rap/electro house band the world has ever seen. You should buy this album and you would learn to love their songs. Visit Sony Music Entertainment (Finland) and you can listen a Real Audio format sample of Freestyler. You will love it so make you a favour and visit: http://www.sonymusic.fi/dance/bomfunk/levyt.html"
4,Pretty good...,"I have to admit when I first saw this CD though, I was thinking ""not good"" but after borrowing it off a friend I found out that it was pretty good.My faves would have to be ""Uprocking Beats,"" ""1, 2, 3, 4,"" ""Sky's The Limit,"" and ""In Stereo."" I don't like ""Freestyler"" 'cos I've heard it so many times..."
2,Disappointment Compared to Harry Potter 2 Game,"This game was a complete let down. All challenges throughout the game are exactly the same and did not vary in difficulty - i.e. moving boxes around and pushing buttons. Game play was only about 12 hours - compared to over 30 hours from the second Harry Potter. The story did not follow the book at all and it was irritating to have to switch between characters to use the various spells. Also, by only allowing two place holders for spells or objects, you have to continually switch back and forth to the menu page selecting the spell you want for that particular activity. Overall, this game was an utter letdown - especially after all the fun and challenge of the Chamber of Secrets game."
4,NEWS,I think this game is going to be the best of the first two games. I think everyone is going to by it. I just can't wait till it comes out. I hope it is not like 30 or 40 dollars. I already know I will love this game.
3,Italian drive-time CDs,"Starts off well with the first CD - and they have made Italian seem really easy to learn while you are driving. But then they jump into heavier grammar and it gets more difficult, the conversational stuff is better for learning while driving - you learn with the repetition."
4,Drive Time (CD): Learn Italian While You Drive,"I like the chance this program gives to repeat Italian words and phrases 3 times before going on to another word/phrase. The 1st disc, however, uses words related only to driving -- car, bus, motorcycle, large, small, colors, etc. -- that arene't too usefule day to day. I also find it is dangerous for me to try to learn while driving because my attention is taken from the road. This may be my own personal learning style, but I don't recommend drive-learning. Also, I do need to see the written word before I can assimilate it. But I think the discs are well-planned, the voices are clear-spoken."
2,Far too difficult to learn much through only listening in a car driving around,"The introductory disc of Drive Time Italian employs the repetition and pace that is reasonable for this type of learning which is while one is driving and listening without textbooks, as it is advertised. Following that disc however, the speakers do not repeat, and the pace is very quick. In additon, the instructor uses technical terms such as 'the infinitive' out of a context to provide support for adult learners who have been away from formal schooling for awhile. The lessons need to be done more slowly, and with much more repetition. The Italian and the English version should be used together so that the learner knows what is being said, and the progress the learner is making. I am very disappointed in this set of CDs and believe they were not worth the money I paid."
3,Slow down !,"This series covers all of the basics needed to converse as a tourist in Italy. It's organized very well. Unfortunately, the native speakers forgot who there target audience is: people not native to Italy ! I find myself tapping the rewind button on the CD player to pick up the speed-talking Italians' dialogue. If they would've spoken a bit slower, especially the female speaker, I could've learned so much more by now. I will be seeking another series to enrich what I already know."
2,Don't waste your money.,"There are better programs out there. There are four CDs in this program. The first CD is really slow. A child could follow along. Then, the following CDs are really difficult to follow. They speak really fast and don't repeat anything. The phrases are too long. They don't break them up. Another thing that bothers me is that the Italian accents on the CD sound a little off. They roll their Rs as if they are speaking Spanish. Actually, they roll their Rs more than Spanish speakers. The lady speaking doesn't have a pleasant voice, either."
2,its okay,not really good to learn to speak italian - taking classes is better for actual communication. I would only recommend this if you were already in a class and needed extra help and refreshing
2,Too fast,"I am taking a beginning Italian class and bought this to help my practicing. The first cd is great, but the second cd goes way too fast and the sections are too short without enough time to fully grasp what is happening."
1,Not for beginners. Only first CD is good.,"First CD is wonderful. I felt like I was really learning. Everything was paced well, they sounded out words. Then I was completely lost on the second one. They do not sound out new words, everything is too fast. There's no time to repeat after they say things. There's no way you can learn this without a book to see what words they are actually saying. Everything rolls together so fast you can't tell what the words sound like. It's quite ridiculous actually. Going back to my Pimsleur discs. They are much better. I really don't understand how this got rated so high. You really need an Italian foundation to understand this after the first disc."
2,Needs improvement,"A great idea to study and practice while driving. One big problem though, the actual physical CD is more thin than average. It skips in my CD player in the car. I don't have this problem with any other CD's that I play. It is very frustrating."
1,They speak too fast.,"The first CD is good. It slowly introduces words and sentences. CD numbers 2, 3, and 4 have native speakers speaking way too fast. For beginners, we need to hear each word said distinctly first. Then they could speak quickly. Also, every sentence that was spoken in Italian was not translated. It would have helped if they spelled the words, too."
3,Fun,"It's kind of fun, but I don't think a person could get far in Italy unless the Italians know English. Worth it for the price."
4,Drive Time Italian: escultate e repetete,"A good program. Four disks -- great value for the money. Do give yourself time to learn the lessons, though. If you're an ""auditory"" learner, this is a great program, but if you need to read AND hear, it's obviously not as effective. The company does provide a modest-sized text, but it's pretty limited in its scope; but then again, it does have to fit into a DC case. Again, this is a great value for the money. Definitely worth a try."
3,before you buy...,"i decided to purchase an audio lesson in italian...so I bought Drive Time. The first c.d. is fantastico. It's easy to follow along and you can get a good grasp of it even though its focused on small phrases. CD2, goes into warp speed and continually gets faster with every c.d. I don't know what happened between cd1 and the rest but i wouldn't reccommend it for beginners. If you know spanish,...great. I'm sure the pace is okay. But if you don't know spanish or any italian, fohget-a-bout-it. There isn't enough time to even repeat some of the words yourself. I find myself hitting pause every phrase/word so i can repeat it at a decent pace. If you decide to purchase it, good luck.ciao ciao."
4,Drive Time: Italian,"I have been using Drive Time: Italian for about a month now. Before now, I never spoke italian in my life. I feel that I could not have a VERY limited conversation in Italian. I think that the lessons go very fast and that it is difficult at times to hear the exact pronounciation of the words they say. Also, the grammer is just thrown into the lessons and not introduced very strategically in my opinion."
1,Shoptaw - On the Outside,"I am alas an ordinary reader and I was curious to see what this Ashbery fuss was all about. I found Ashbery's poetry to be quite obscure and thought Shoptaw's book might help me make some sense of it. I was greatly disappointed. The book was clearly a tour de force of rank archanery. Shoptaw seems quite impressed with his ability to dazzle us with obscure jargon but it left me baffled. In the end I was no closer to understanding or appreciating Ashbery. To write that the ""cryptographic process is indecipherable"" is itself on the very face of it patently indecipherable. This book may impress fellow members of his academic cult but it did not speak to me and,I venture to guess, other ordinary readers."
3,Very Cool,"This thing has so many uses. I use it as a backpack, a messenger, a saddle bag. It's great if you ride a bike or motorcycle (me), because it doesn't get in the way or shift like a normal backpack"
5,the beats keep goin',"Lots of value here. Great, upbeat and addictive song offered in various incarnations to satisfy your individual tastes. Erasure maintains their finger on the pulse of what sounds really good and keeps the feet tapping. They've quite simply mastered the art of the perfect electro-pop song, as evidenced by this savory morsel of a single."
1,Item was unstable and had to be returned,Item would not work consistently even with new drivers downloaded from the manufacturer. Programmable keys lose their programming. Had to return the item.
2,Not Effective Product,I bought this product thinking that the view through glass would become largely opaque. Wrong. I can still clearly see items stored behind the glass doors of a TV entertainment center. The film is too thin to be effective. I only give it 2 stars because it was easy enough to install. I doubt two layers will be effective - or even possible.
2,Etched Glass Window Film,I purchased this for a sliding glass door. It says you can see outside but no one can see in. That is not true. I cannot see outside through this film. It is OK but not what I thought it should be. Easy to install.
4,worked as promised,This film was just as easy to ap ply as the directions said. The trick is to read the directions. Great Product. I would buy it again.
4,easier to work with than I thought,"I bought this for a small project, and I have a lot of it left over! It was much easier to work with than I thought it would be. It has adhered very well, and I am pleased with the results, it's just what I wanted. I looked around for different products and ideas to frost this glass on a light fixture and this was the one I purchased because of the price and ease of use. The directions say not to use it where it will be in contact with heat, but this fixture I have is large and the glass is not at all close to the lightbulb, so I thought I'd try it. It is fine. The adhesion is tight and it looks very nice. It is holding up very well, too. I can understand the directions warning about putting it in contact with any heat source, that just makes sense and I would recommend reconsidering the application if it is too close to heat."
2,Disappointed,"This is my first review of any product. The reason I am writing is to caution others that when you purchase something that cannot be returned, because you have cut and installed it, make very sure that it will perform as promised. This film is NOT privacy film, you can see completely through it. My money was wasted."
1,Useless Product,"I wish I could give this items no stars. The roll was delivered with kinks in it that could not be taken out. After getting over the annoyance of that, I attempted to work around the ""kinked"" areas to discover that it barely adheres to the window. Garbage. Don't waste your money on this."
2,Glass Film,"Pro: Very easy to apply and secure.Con: too expensive. almost $30 per film and is only good for 1 window. With this price, you can almost get a brand new window."
3,"Works fine, but expensive.","I thought this product did the job, but I can't get over that it was $23. It seems overpriced. It is like thick plastic wrap. I mean it is thick enough not to be completely flimsy, but still. Also there is no grid on the back to make cutting easier. I spent about 10 minutes measuring and 10 minutes cutting to make sure it was a good fit, for a small window. It looks much better now. When applying the product spray plenty of water because that makes the application so much easier."
5,Great Buy,Bought this for a back door with an large uncovered window. This came as advertised - comes with a squeegee to smooth out the air bubbles. Great adhesion. Comes on a slick static peel sheet. Just cut to approximate dimensions of your window and get yourself an xacto knife and use the window edge as a guide to trim. Really easy. Really simple. Lets decent light through - but still opaque enough to not be able to see through either side. Recommended.
3,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I THOUHT,IT WAS HARDER TO INSTALL LIKE INSTALING TINT ON A CAR BUT OK RESULTS HAD TO GET ALL THE BUBLES OUT I WISH IT WAS THINNER
4,Good product,"This product works very well and is simple to use as long as you follow the directions. I like the privacy it gives while still letting light through. It's great too because you can take it off, move it, cut it and reuse it."
4,Worked really well,"When we moved into our new house, their were windows on either side of the front door that had no covering. They were too thin for blinds but I really don't like the idea of someone being able to come to my front door (or walk in front of my house) and see inside.So we purchased this window film and I put it up. It was actually easy to install (easier than I thought it would be) and looks good. You just put some water on the window, position the film accordingly, and then scrape the water out. It isn't a sticky product, so you don't have to worry about that at all.It looks really good on the window and allows light in but completely blocks people from seeing inside. My only complaint is that it seems to be coming up around the edges now that it has been up for a few months. I don't know if that was an installation error or just a problem, but otherwise it is pretty solid."
4,Wow!,"Easy to apply, looks great. Very forgiving. I'm ordering another. Wish they offered more designs in the length and width I need. 24x60"
5,Great solution for privacy,"I moved into a home with an oval window in the front door and two sidelights. I really prefer that people not be able to peer into my home, so I was looking for a way to obtain some privacy without obstructing all of the light. I tried magnetic curtain rods and sheer curtains, but they did not provide enough privacy and I had a hard time finding ones that would fit the measurements well. When this product arrived, I found it very easy to adhere to the glass. I did as someone else had suggested and cut the film after attaching it to the window. This worked very well for me, and I think is a lot easier than trying to precut an exact oval. All in all, it looks nice from both sides and I have the privacy that I desired. Great product!"
4,Works like it should,"We are a nonprofit organization and purchased this product to add privacy to some of our offices that had windows that looked into other parts of the building we're housed in. The other reviews and tips were very helpful and accurate--it's pretty easy to install and relatively fast. The so-called ""squeegee"" that was included was fairly useless, but we used a wide metal putty knife that worked really slick. We ended up with a few air bubbles after the fact but nothing overly distracting. This product lets in filtered light and you can see movement through it but nothing clearly unless there is something right up against the pane."
1,bubbles galore,I squeegeed these to death and they still had bubbles. It is also very hard to trim. I'm disappointed in this product.
4,Good for temporary use,"Good product for short term use. I ordered this to cover some windows during a Christmas party. I didn't want guests to be able to see the caterers. It was great of the occasion, but if you got too close, you would see bubbles. This may have been caused by the fact that this was the first time I'd put something like this up tough. It served it's purpos well, but I took it down as soon as the party was over."
4,Etched Glass Window Film,"The quality of this product is good, but I was under the impression that this was an adhesive film, not a static cling. It seemed to work fine for our application though."
3,Clan Sea Fox espionage,It was interesting to learn something about little known Clan Sea Fox. I felt the book was lacking a certain something. Basically it was all about petty infighting among subdivisions of the Clan. I was hoping that it would contain more about their interactions with the spheroids.
5,I hope the library doesn't lose this book,"This is my daughter's FAVORITE book. We have taken it out of the library on 4 different occasions over the second and third years of her life. I would love to have it in print again, and there is no need to update the pictures, they are very attractive to young child. Even weeks after we have read it and then come to a stop light, she still says ""red light they they cannot go, green light they can"". Find this book and give it to a young person you love."
2,"Pretty good, but also really boring.","This books was pretty good, but I thought it was pretty boring. I usually don't think any books are boring, but this one was b-o-r-i-n-g! I'd get it if I were you, though, just to try it out, because judgeing by the other reviews here, I guess it depends on what kind of books you like."
3,Beautiful Russian opera but poor video and audio,"This is a beautiful Russian opera shot on location in St. Petersburg and I believe the Hermitage. The actors are all gorgeous and the lip syncing with professonal opera singers is effective. However, it is marred with poor cinematography, poor editing and poor sound track."
2,"Not as nice looking as the duvet, doesn't reach floor","I liked the duvet cover but can't say the same about the bedskirt. The denim is perhaps a little too distressed. More importantly, the bedskirt doesn't reach the carpet, so it just hangs in the air looking forlorn. It's disappointing since the bed I have it on is about average height."
4,Denim bed skirt,The bed skirt was just as described and goes perfectly with the Tommy Hilfiger denim comforter. My son loves it.
1,Don't waste your money,"Not a good Kindle book format. This is an old, old book, maybe from the 30's. There may be some good recipes, but the book is difficult to navigate, paragraphs run together. Just not a very readable book."
1,Failed Early,"I purchased this faucet at a local supplier. One year after installation it started to drip and then spray water all over the place from the seam between the spout ring (part of the main vertical post post) and the rest of the post structure. Under warranty I was shipped two O-rings. I asked about instructions and was advised that a plumber could do the repair or I could try to figure it out from a (very poor) online drawing.Not the type of performance, quality or support I expected from a firm that represents itself as a high end classy operation.Very expensive, very short life, poor customer support."
1,Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch,"Three of the four plays were ok, but the first of the titles-all about al--demonstrated nothing but bombastic stupidity. It was so pathetically adolescent that you did not want to read any further. In fact, all you wanted to do was get your money back. Save yourself the time and don't purchase this nonsense."
1,Worked for a week,I purchased this alarm system for my 5th wheel. It worked great for a week and then stopped working. hmmmmmm
4,fantastic,"this item took a little while to set up with the other skylink system purchased but is simple to understand and works very well. after dealing with skylink to correct the dialer problem, very satisfied"
1,Poor range,"I purchased this system to monitor an apartment, placing one of the sensors on the front door. I tried to position the base station about 20 feet away, nearly clear line of sight (not going through any walls). Unfortunately, the receiver didn't detect the sensor at all. I moved the unit closer and found that it was erratic around 15 feet, and reliable at about only 10 feet.Unfortunately, this is setup is not feasible for my apartment, which I didn't expect to be a problem based on the quoted range. Kudos to Amazon for a hassle-free return process. I'm planning to try one of the similar GE systems instead."
5,Great price and product,This product is in addition to my SC-1000 and keep my family safe. I don't have to spent a thousand of dollar and monitoring fee.
4,"Love it, but stick to the screws.","This security system was easy to set up. I have thick plaster walls, but the remote works well from a distance. I did get false alarms, because I tried to use the sticky foam to mount it so I wouldn't have to put holes in the walls of my apartment. When temperature fluctuates, these seemingly VERY sticky strips do not hold, the sensors fall off, the alarm goes off, and the neighbors are unhappy. Ever since I secured it with screws, it has worked well. My only gripe is that there is no way to know if the alarm has been tripped while I was away from home, unless the neighbors say something."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I purchased this alarm for my pool house/storage shed. I didn't need much. I didn't get much. The alarms are not that loud. The remotes are lucky to work from 25 feet, no where near 100 feet. The system is cheap, made in China. All you have to do is unplug it and turn the switch to off and the alarm shuts off. Takes about 10 seconds and the entire system is rendered useless. My only hope is that if somebody does try to break in they just head for the hills, thinking the system may be reporting somehwere. The loudness of the alarm certainly won't scare them. If they take the time to look at the system, I may find them on the floor, dead from laughter. All in all, a poor system but probably sufficient for my needs. For the price, I shouldn't complain. I wouldn't use it in my house though."
5,security system,"I have not install it yet, but reading the intstroctions and what it is capable of doing it seems real good product."
4,Apartment Security,"Hey guys, We bought this system couple days ago and received it very fast. It took about 30 min to read through the manual and another 30 to get stuff ready. We like it.The siren is very very loud,yeah to be honest. The remotes and the sensors all are already programmed so no need to do so yourself.(You might if not,but easy too).I used screws to attach all even though they provide some double sided kind of tape.Just don't want to have surprises to have stuff fall off and start buzzing out of control! When it comes to the range, it's very good. From my bed or from the front yard I can set it up and also de-activate the system(with the remote).My wife and I each have a remote. I think the price is kind of right. Not too cheap or expensive. That's the basic system we need for now. Only con is we have to change some batteries in the long run especially the remote controls.But don't you worry cause the main system has AC adapter to power it!Good luck and be safe!"
3,"simple unit, doesn't provide alarm zones",I bought this unit thinking it would allow a delayed entry or exit option. It doesn't. I kept the unit and used it as a remote sounding unit for the SC 101 panel from Skylink. This combination works great. On another note: This unit lost about 1/2 of its volume after a couple of alarm tests. This was the first time I had an issue with anything I have purchased from Amazon....WOW what great service. A simple email and the replacement was in the mail with a PREPAID return for the defective unit. I was totally impressed! Also see my review on the keypad and SC 101 panel.
4,This and the Panasonic Pet Cam Great Combo,"This system has been working fine. We use the Panasonic Pet Cam also to see our driveway, and living room. The alarm can call the phone, and the phone can look at the cameras."
5,Ah good old memories.,"I remember the first time I heard a warlock pinchers tape. it was love at first listen. I'm glad to see that it is no longer out of print, as my tape is really worn out. Time to upgrade to CD."
4,Source Code listings for Math Programming work as advertised,"The title says it all; this book lists the source code for various Mathematical Programming algorithms: linear, quadratic, integer, branch & bound, and parametric linear, plus discusses enough of the mathematics involved to make it all rational. The codes were developed at the London School of Economics to support coursework, so they have been debugged by generations of students. This author has used the code for Quadratic Programming to do mean-variance optimization for selection of efficient investment portfolios and found it to be solid."
1,A waste of money,"For $59.00 the movie is a rip off, it is only about 30 min. long .It doesn't go into any detail at all and is a waste of time."
4,A Period of Transition,"Stewart's first recording for Warner Brothers, this set is satisfying but no match to his finest Mercury output (most notably ""Every Picture Tells A Story"").That said, for those who bought the original CD (which was extremely hissy and flat), this remastering is a *revelation*! 24-bit audio (not listed on the outside of the packaging) and a very obvious attention to detail make the upgrade a no-brainer (the other Stewart remasters are similarly striking).Hear Rod's Muscle Shoals effort like you've never heard it before. Musically, it's above par. Sonically, it's never been better."
5,Great music,This is a must in everyone's collection who likes Rod Stewart. Rounding out my collection.
4,Great CD,"Some eclectic songs here that make great music to slather (bbq sauce) by. The boppin' opener by Mitch Woods is awesome, really puts you in the mood, followed by wry humor wrapped in authentic lamentations on a subject most soulful, good southern-style cooking. Has the historic relevance you'd expect from House of Blues, with some numbers dug up from God knows where as well as big headliners. The actual BBQ content is somewhat diluted with ditties on other dishes, but enough to go on. A fun CD to have if you're serious about your 'cue and want to spend a soulful afternoon. Crack a cold one and enjoy!"
4,Great old Blues!,"If your a blues nut,this is a great one! Old forgotten blues songs about soul foods! Very cool! Love the potatochip song!"
1,BEWARE this is a generic knock-off!!!!!!!!,"This is NOT made by Honeywell as described. It is a generic replacement filter and it has a terrible odor. The item also arrives via US Mail, yet you will be charged UPS/FED-EX prices."
1,Filter was ripped,I received a ripped filter along with a note explaining that this is actually not the Honeywell brand name filter but an 'equivalent' product. It's possible the filter was during shipping because it was sent in a soft packing envelope. I am very disappointed.
2,"""Generic"" is Correct","I would agree with other reviewers-- it's ""generic,"" and although appears (very) solidly built, the air-flow is HEAVILY restricted. (I thought my machine was toast. I didn't want to burn out the motor!) In contrast, I've used 2 ""Honywell"" branded filters and they worked markedly better. Kaz.com owns the Honywell Brand for air-purifiers, and supplies the ""Honeywell"" brand replacement heppa filters--check them out. They aren't $9.95, but they do WORK."
1,flimsy poor design and paper falls apart if you touch it,"First off is not hepa, not a honeywell, and as I was inspecting it my finger every so slightly touched the paper, it crumbled like some old dried something. Just skip past this one and find another. Not worth the 2 dollar savings."
5,Much needed item for patient!,This was a impossible item to find locally and we needed it for a patient's home. The turnaround time was excellent and the product did not disappoint.
5,The music is chill and I love that,"I use this music on my drive to my yoga class. This well constructed series of songs is well suited for my needs. It is also great music just to have playing around the house. The first cut ""Aureola"" just sets you up for a great listening experience. Those doves in the background great touch. Get into a celestial mood by enjoying ""Cape Porcupine"", haunting and just lovely. Here is a suggestion, listen to ""The Orbiting Suns"", under a starlit night, with a good glass of wine. Oh that is heaven. Great complilation. Well done, Sequoia, you have a fan."
5,Yoga Moods,I teach several yoga classes and this is one of my favorites. I have actually bought this CD more than one time...
3,"Nice, but needs more juice","Good form factor, nice price... However, I would really recommend getting something with a little more power... At full volume, it does ok in a quite room, but leaves you wanting more..."
1,"no sound, not work.","I bought it on June 16, 2008, and it stopped working on July 21, 2008. Less than 40 days, such a low quality product!"
4,sleek,"Really like this speaker system, it is sleek, comes in a bag so you can take it wherever and the sound is great. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because it is a little cumbersome to get the connecting cable in and out of the speaker, other than that, it's great."
4,Nice Little Set of Speakers,"Performance wise, it's a nice sounding set of speakers for $35. The designs are a plus/minus thing for me. It has a visually pleasing shape when opened vs. the typical squarish designs of other speakers. On the other hand, it also makes it very difficult to pack into a typical laptop case because of the curvature of the unit when closed. The battery operation of the unit is very convenient but replacing the batteries will be a chore."
4,Good product...Great price,"For $35, I think this was a real bargain. Sound is decent, volume is more than enough for a small room, but then again, I'm no head-banger. Used it on our recent cruise and it worked great. Haven't tried battery option so no comment on battery life.I just hope that this doesn't blow out like my JBL Creature II. Got my fingers crossed."
4,Great sounding portable speaker for your Ipod or laptop,"Weighs less than a pound.Measures 7"" x 3.5"" x 1.4""Comes with an AC adapterRequires 4 ""AAA""s if not using Ac adapterPros:-Loud enough for it size. Decent sound and base. Certainly louder than my Creative TravelSound 400 Portable Speaker System.-Love the slide cover design-Sleek looking.-Unlike the Creative Travelsound, the speakers have grills to protect it.-Rubber footing prevents it from sliding off the table.Cons:-Battery compartment is somewhat difficult to place and remove batteries. Opening the compartment is also not a piece of cake.-Awkward placement of the power input and audio jack. You have to unplug both to close the lid.-one of the toughest bubble product case I have struggled opening. Be careful cutting your fingers.-batteries not includedOff button? Press the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons at the same time.This appeared at least 3 times on Amazon Goldbox (Around 39$)"
3,Mixed Feelings,"The sound was decent considering how small the speakers are, but I ended up returning these as the connecting wire made crackling sounds when adjusted."
4,Nice,Super Sound in a small compact package. You will be very pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.Definitely makes listening to music and watching movies much more enjoyable (from a laptop) with these speakers. I would recommend these speakers to anyone considering upgrading the sound quality of a laptop or any other portable device. Pretty good deal too.
4,Nice Sound,"I purchased this mainly to listen to my Kindle, but it also does an excellent job with my iPod."
5,Great Portable Speaker,I'm a traveling/touring audio-visual technician. A co-worker turned my on to this speaker. I have no regrets about purchasing this unit. Reasonably compact. Very good sound for the size/money.
4,Portable speaker system,"Great little speaker - the volume has been sufficient even for outdoor entertaining, coupled with MP3 player's volume. Sound is surprisingly clear and full-bodied. Great quality for the price"
4,Great speakers for travel,"I was having a hard time finding a set of good portable speakers. I purchased these at a Staples store (and overpaid) with the expectation that I would probably be returning them the next day. It turns out that these are a great set of travel speakers. Don't expect lots of bass, or great stereo separation. What you can expect is good sound, good volume, and good portability. I wouldn't purchase these to just use as stationary speakers, the emphasis is here is travel.When used with a good set of NiMH AA rechargeable batteries, battery life is actually very good. When closed, the case packs nicely in luggage or a backpack."
3,Decent system for close quarters only,"I purchased the On Tour primarily for listening to music in my backyard. The hook-up to an MP3 player is simple and the sound quality is decent. However, the volume level achievable is disappointingly modest. I was hoping I could set it up and move around my backyard and listen as the area is only about 600 square feet. The fact that I'm in the city probably doesn't help at all, but if I get further than 6 feet or so away, the volume level is just unsatisfactory. If you are indoors and just want to set up this system next to you or in a small room, it's probably fine. For my purposes it's a bust."
3,Okay speakers that I am glad I got on sale,"I got my speakers for about $40, and that is about what they are worth. They are very portable, but certainly not the great sounding speakers I expected since they retail for $100. And I could hardly get them out of the plastic packaging!! There is no reason for anything boxed to be packed in such thick plastic."
1,Broke fast,"Not sure if the moving parts are the issue, but it broke in about 6 months. I have a friend with one at work, his broke as well."
3,Sound is comparable to other compact units.,"I bought this for an up coming trip I was taking. After I received them I came across a different make that had an ipod dock and charger. For me this worked out better for travel, and the sound was comparable. The problem I had was that I didn't have time to return them before my trip. I purchased them from Jowow. They only allow 14 days for returns, so I was unable to return them. From past experience, Amazon allows 30 days. I suggest checking the merchants return policies before purchasing anything that doesn't come directly from amazon. I will avoid jowow from now on."
3,"Sound Quality good, product not what expected","I bought this as an impulse Gold box/kind of what i needed. I thought it was the larger one, buyer beware. It does not sound as good as the large which I heard in a store but it is decent and I will be keeping it. I think it was worth the $40 but If you're paying regular price spend a little more and get something larger, unless you need something small then this will do."
2,Volume intolerant,"This is a nice looking speaker however, if I turn up the volume the music would sound choppy and sometimes inaudible. I could only raise the volume half way. I don't think that I would be able to use this in the park for a private picnic and still hear my music."
3,Good value when it was on sale,OK Sound. Bought it mainly to study the design. Good value when it was on sale - would have been disappointed if paid full price.
5,Happily Surprised,"I was happily surprised when I hooked these speakers up to my ipod - the sound quality is great for such a small set of speakers! They performed well connected to my laptop as well. I was going to gripe about them not automatically turning off (especially when I use them with batteries instead of the AC Adapter) until I found that if you close the cover, they turn off.The only bad thing about this is that you have to totally disconnect all the cords in the back in order to do this. Meaning if you want these to be desktop speakers and always open and connected to your laptop or ipod, you definitely have to use the AC Adapter and settle for them always being on. Not a huge negative especially since these were probably made with portability in mind.All in all, this is a great set of speakers, with great sound. It was just what I needed for my home office/travel needs."
3,So-So,I bought this item based on other reviews and was a little disappionted. I guess it's pretty good for its size and price. It's definately not worth rave reviews though.
4,Rocks!!,"Good sound, portable, Just what I was looking for. My Brother inlaw has one also. He loves it. If mine broke I would buy another."
4,JBL,"Great Sound for the Price. I purchased 3. One for myself, one for my wife, and another for a friend."
5,Good Value!,"Not the ""be all and end all"" of laptop speakers, though they work quite well.Could use more low end, but oter than that, they're truly acceptable."
3,Reasonably good portable speakers,"I got these when Amazon sold them for $40. The pros and cons are as follows:Pros:- Nice design, portable, 110/220 v hence good for overseas use too.Cons:- No bass to speak of.- If you don't put in batteries the AC powered speakers require you to hit the volume button multiple times. There is no way to remember your last volume level settings.- No on/off switch hence only option is to unplug the a/c cord to the unit.Overall good for $40 or so, if you plan to spend more there are better alternatives around."
1,love JBL on tour speakers,"For their size they are great. Very crisp highs for everything you would like to listen to. If its an audio book or music, you won't be disapointed with the on tour speakers."
2,Open with blow torch only!!!!,"While this may be a marvelous product, I am still trying to get throug the bubble wrap. I have so far ruined a pair scissors, a disposble scaple, and my temper. I will make a note NEVER to buy from this company again. I am tired of trying to open Fort Knox."
4,What???,"Is this the same model as I purchased three years ago? It sure looks the exact same and the way in which reviewers are describing it, it does seem to be the same model. It is a fantastic system...still going strong, great sound. I paid only $39.99 for the system which was on sale from $52.99 (I believe, I know it was not more than a $55.00 regular price). I went back to my order history (June 2008) and copied this:1 of: JBL On Tour Portable Speaker System ( Black ) [CD] [Electronics]Sold by: Amazon.com LLC $39.99If this is the same, why the heck is it so expensive now?"
3,adequate but not great sound,"I found these speakers useful, and they provide much better sound than my laptop speakers, plus they are useful when traveling with an iPod. But, the sound quality doesn't come close to my average desktop PC speakers, so I would go with something else if you are looking for high quality sound."
4,Good sound for the size,"This is an extremely compact 2 speaker system> Although not loud enough for a crowded room full of people, this would be perfect for the beach or camping. Crystal clear sound and never any distortion...also will automatically shut off before the speakers blow if it gets too much power."
1,not that great of sound and the adapter cord was defective,"I was really looking forward to getting some portable speakers for my laptop since its speakers are not very loud or good. However, the adapter that goes from the unit to the speaker port was defective and in order to hear anything, I have to wiggle the cord. Once I could hear it, I wasn't that impressed with the sounds. Hopefully I can find another adapter cord."
3,Not bad...volume a little lower than expected,The sound quality is good for the price. I thought these speakers would blow my regular cheap desktop speakers out of the water. It is louder and a greater quality but not as much as I would have expected.
2,Lousy Design,"I really rate this item 2 1/2 stars. It sounds fairly good, but there is no way to turn in off without closing the cover. You can't close the cover with the AC adapter or the MP3 player cable connected.At low volume the sound is mediocre at best. With a little more volume it sound okay. I would not recommend this item."
4,Perfect for the price...,"I bought this speaker brand new after reviewing a number of other portable ones. It is a quality product as I would expect from JBL. I love the volume touch feature along with folding protective cover. At this price, it makes a perfect gift or treat yourself with clear and crisp sound on the go."
4,Great for Travelers,"Tiny speakers, big sound, nice design (except for the awkward wires in the back).Don't expect to throw raves or parties with this, or having blaring bass coming out of the room. The sound quality is fantastic, especially for the price, and the sound can fill a room nicely. I travel 4 days a week and it's perfect for a hotel room, pre partying, or just chilling.It's also great to take to the beach or tailgate since it can operate on batteries as well.Highly recommend for travelers that want to take their music with them."
4,A great travel companion,"I bought the JBL On Tour just before leaving on a cruise. The product worked great. Its ""clam shell"" design makes it easy to pack and keeps the speakers protected from damage. One feature I like a lot is that it can be powered using the supplied power cord, or by four double-A batteries. My wife and I plugged our iPods into the On Tour and had a great time listening in our cabin aboard ship. The sound quality is quite good, but definitely not great. If you are looking for something with really great bass response, this isn't going to do it, but if you aren't an audiophile and just want to listen to music and other audio casually, you'll be happy with the JBL On Tour."
4,JBL offers quality and convenience,"I was very pleased with this system. It has a very appealing design and is convenient. I really like the fact that multiple systems can be used on it, i.e. ipod, zune, etc. For being a small system it delivers a lot of sound. My only complaints are that you can't fit the power cord into the case that come with the system and I guess this is foolish on my part but I was really hoping the system would offer stereo quality sound (it doesn't) but I'm yet to find a small system that does."
4,"Good value, clear and power sound.","Got it with $39.99 from Amazon.Agree with most of reviews that the speaker is small but it gives out clear and powerful sound that has no problem to fill in a 20x20 room. The bass is kind of weak but that is expected given its small size. And you can improve the bass with the EQ on your MP3. The small size make it's pretty portable. Yes, the pouch can hold the speaker only, but I use 4 AAA rechargeable batteries. So there is no need for me to carry around the AC plug.I take out 1 point because the protective plastic cover does not seem to be strong. So, special attention is needed when sliding the protective cover. I would recommend it to my friends."
5,Great Portable Speaker,"Can't think of anything better. It is compact, light, easy to carry and has good sound quality."
3,Nice package!,"Sleek and compact design. Very portable, but wish that the power cord and ipod connector were placed somewhere else so I can close the unit, and still have the unit connected to the power."
5,Very Good sound in a small package,I wanted something to use with my notebook. The built-in speakers are always a bit weak in those units and headphones get a bit old after a while. I was both surprised and pleased at the sound that came out of this small unit. The power adapter is also vary handy.
4,"Sleek, Compact - Packs a punch","The JBL on tour has been a very good buy for me. Since I travel a lot I always wanted a very compact speaker system for my laptop, and this is it.Its good looking and sleek and has good sound output. I am totally satisfied with the quality of sound that I get from this speaker.The only con would be that there is no indicator to show at what level your speaker volume is, so you don't know if it is at maximum, minimun or in between. But that just a small negative for an overall good product."
4,Excellent Speaker System for MP3 Player,I bought this Speaker System approximately 2 years ago and it still works fine. I use it with a ZUNE mp3 player and it has held up well and continues to have good sound. I've taken it to the beach a couple of times and used batteries. My only complaint about this system is the sliding cover will not close if the cord is connected. Not a big deal though. I paid $99.00 at Target.
3,good sound for compact shape,"i bought this product as a back up to the expensive portable speaker system for my girlfriend. something to take to the beach, toss in the car, out in the yard...but, then i bought my own ipod and now i use this for work. nice fit on my desk, sound is good (though i keep it low), and i still plane to take it places."
3,No Bass. Only the mid-range is fine.,"I was hoping to keep it for the good price and portability. However, other than piano and accoustic music, everything else if just off. And I am only a casual classical music listener. If you really want to ENJOY music, look into more expensive, better speaker."
4,Awesome sound in a little package.,"I have purchased and tired several potable speaker systems to use with my ipod and for other portable media devices, and I have to say that I have been let down by most of them. Once I got this black beauty I plugged it in and WOW!!!!!! From the very first song I played on it I was hooked. It really can fill a room. There is great deal of head room before the speakers even start to give off a slight hint of distortion, and for small portable speakers there is a nice bass response as well. I highly recomend this portable speaker system!"
5,I like these,"For some reason the speakers in my laptop got tinny sounding and I figured these would take care of that. I wasn't wrong! Even my hard of hearing (selective hearing) husbands first comment was ""Those have a really nice sound!!""They sound so much better than what I had. I just have to remember to turn them on after I've had them unplugged.I would definitely recommend them to anyone that wants something small."
2,Not worth it,"I was hoping for some good quality speakers for my Ipod, something that would give me good sound. What I got was a massive battery hog (after I got some AAA batteries) and sound that had absolutely no bass and was tin-ish quality. Unless you turn it over, then there is no trebble and tin-ish quality."
5,Good sound in portable speaker,"Good sound in a portable speaker.Wish it had a place for the connecting cord, but oh well.Compact and speakers are protected when case is closed.It is not a ""room filler"", but is probably best of breed for portables."
5,Great with any MP3 Player,"JBL On Tour Portable Speaker System ( Black )I got this for my Sansa e250 MP3 Player, wanting to be sure it was not proprietary, ie, just for the iPod. It works great and the sound is smooth, rich, and vibrant. I am totally amazed that a system so small delivers such wonderful, distortion free, pure sound. The Product Description is accurate, truthful, and provides full details. Truly a great product!"
4,Excellent book and a must read for all interested in JTR,"I have read most of the well-known books on Jack the Ripper and I think this is probably my favorite. I found this in my school's library (I teach high school English) and thought the author did a very good job pointing out the problems with the suspects generally believed to have been the Ripper and painting a good case for Dr. T. An excellent read. Also, if you're intested in books about serial killers, check out ""Zodiac"" by Robert Graysmith. An incredibly interesting case (and still unsolved)."
4,Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer,"This book was an excellent read. The authors bring to light some interesting facts heretofore not related to the public. The American lodger was never thoroughly probed in the press but apparently drew more attention from the Yard than they let on at the time. Discovery of the Littlechild letter helps fill in some long missing and important pieces of the puzzle. Including the information of several identical 'Ripper' killings in Jamaica and South America at a time Dr. T. was unaccounted for, but being eagerly sought by operatives from Scotland Yard. The authors build a very plausible case for Dr. Tumblety as 'Jack the Ripper' given their lead from Inspector Littlechild. I'm convinced."
4,Respectable Ripper Theory,"This is a very respectable Ripper book centered on a certain Mr. Tumblety, a recently discovered contender for the identity of Jack the Ripper. The two British authors can really write and reading their work shows us, among other things, how superior the Brit school systems still are. They have done meticulous research and have restrained themselves from frivolous yarn spinning. Whether you think Tumblety did it or not this is a very worthwhile book if you like this subject."
4,Fascinating but unconvincing,"The Littlechild letter was an exciting find, but I remained unconvinced Tumblety was a viable JTR suspect. Unlike other JTR books though, I feel the authors present their story in an honest and well researched manner and I didn't get the feeling facts were fudged or glossed over altogether.While Tumblety probably didn't commit the crimes (he didn't fit the description very well and I cannot believe JTR was that organized and competent to amass a small fortune), I wouldn't rule out he murdered others and I would still recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Whitechapel murders."
1,"Amazon online said pkg arrived, but it did not","Amazon's online package tracking said the book arrived, but it did not. I have no idea where the book might have been dropped off other than my home, where it was supposed to be sent."
3,The Nimrod Flipout: Stories Review,"""The Nimrod Flipout"" is a collection of extremely short stories. There are thirty that span only 160 pages. For this reason, it's easy to forgive the hit-and-miss nature of TNF, and of microfiction in general. There's very little time or energy to be invested, so if the story doesn't pan out, it's no big loss, and there are plenty of other options in the book.As I read through Flipout, I made notes on the stories I was particularly fond of, at the end, I ended up with a list of 10. ""Fatso,"" ""Your Man,"" ""Surprise Egg,"" ""Glittery Eyes,"" ""A Thought in the Shape of a Story,"" ""Gur's Theory of Boredom,"" ""Bwoken,"" ""Ironclad Rules,"" ""A Good Looking Couple,"" and ""Angle."" They range from insightful, to funny, to emotionally moving. The other twenty stories included here were just icing on the cake.Keret's pacing is very impressive, and everything moves forward at a brisk pace. Nothing important omitted, nothing needless retained. A worthwhile read, definitely."
2,Downtowners,"While the topic was interesting the quality of the video was very poor, sometimes all you saw was ground. It needs editing, it is too long, and the poor quality of the film takes away from the topic."
4,An engaging account of a terrible tragedy,"I found this book to be terribly engaging, despite the fact that I already knew how it was going to end. I had seen documentaries and read news accounts of the Clutter murders before, but had never read this, the definitive account of the slayings. Capote is able to bring the victims, their friends, and those who brought their killers to justice alive through his in-depth analysis and eloquent style. At times the psychiatric analysis of Hickock and Smith is a little dry, but these are necessary passages if we are to understand the motive behind this terrible event. Depsite the fact that the outcome of the story is, if not common knowledge, then at least easily predictable, Capote is able to find twists and turns in the story that constantly keep the reader guessing as to what will happen next."
5,Breathtaking!,"If you read the first paragraph of Truman Capote's ""In Cold Blood"" it may seem at first to just be a descriptive opening for the book until you read it again. Those opening lines can almost be scanned as poetry because Capote has breathed his life, his unique talent into them and as you read on, you'll see all the words of this true crime story transcend ordinary writing. It is the difference between a great writer and a mediocre one, that special life-breath, that rare life- force that is the hallmark of only a few. Writing sublimely is a gift that cannot be acquired, it is incorporated in the genes. It's there, from the moment of birth. And Truman Capote had it."
4,"Superb writing, excellent research!","Capote founded the genre of the full length book accounting of real life crimes with his detailed researching and excellent writing recounting this tragic, horrific crime in the heartland."
5,Brilliant,"A great read. I checked negative reviews just because I was unsure how negative reviews could be written about this book. The complaint seems to be that the killers were 'humanized'. I don't understand that argument - the killers were human. It makes me uncomfortable too, but it's not Truman's fault. At no point does he excuse them of their crime, and did not in my judgement paint them sympathetically. If anything, the book highlighted just how inexcusable such a crime was. It is also strange to reflect how such a good thing can be produced out of such a horrible crime - if not for the crime, the book wouldn't exist. That also makes me uncomfortable - but judging the work on its own terms, it's a masterpiece. Superbly written."
4,Still shocking,"What surprised me the most about this book was how shocking it remains after 40 years and countless similar acts of violence. Capote's writing was excellent. I was drawn in much stronger and faster than I expected to be. Had a hard time putting it down. He does a wonderful job of setting the time, place and people. You feel the deep loss and dispair along with the community. His exploration of the murderers as people is very interesting.I honestly don't remeber what inspired me to read this, but I'm awfully glad I did. Good, good stuff."
3,Too Much Fact,This was carefully reseached and filled with facts. Maybe too many facts. Sometimes the plot was bogged down with factual information and we lost interest in the Clutter's or the Killers. Truman Capote does a wonderful job in keeping this story true but it seems that it would have been more interesting to read if the plot had been paid more attention. It's still quite a good book one that I recommend to the true crime fans.
3,Age Matters,"The book arrived very quickly! Good thing as it couldn't afford to age another day... pages are dark yellow/tan and the smell is atrocious. However, other than that, the book is as promised, in pretty good condition."
3,Heart-warming in a cold blooded killer kind of way...,"I actually read this book for my AP Language and Composition class and have recently anaylzed it more than once over. Capote used this opportunity to show you the other side of these famed killers and give you some insight into their minds. Also, I happen to know that Perry Smith and Capote became very close during the interview process which adds some interesting points to the book. You can see a human- interest story in Capote's writing as well. Overall, I reccommend the book but would have preferred to read it for pleasure and not as a requirement."
1,Wrong Reader,"I don't like to be critical but Scott Brick's reading ruins the novel. His bizarre inflections and mid-throat waverings sound like a frail main on the verge of tears. Not the voice for this type of hard-boiled nonfiction. Very distracting. He also did major damage in his chapter readings of Bolano's ""2066."""
2,In cold blood,"When I finally recived the book I was really pleased, but I was a little upset that it took longer then they had told me so they had to send another copy which came right away."
2,Too much fluff,"After seeing Capote the movie, I was anxious to read the story behind the case. I found though that the book spent too much time on what I felt was unneccessary to the keep me interested in the story. Too much fluff. I had a hard time staying in the story, and eventually gave up half way through. I am not even curious to read on."
4,Another case of the book being far better than the movie,"One of the first true crime novels to be written in a narrative style, this book is touching at times and foreboding at others. The subhead of the book is ""A True Account of a Multiple Murder and Its Consequences,"" but the book delves deeper than that. On November 15, 1959, a family of four, the Clutters, is brutally murdered ""In Cold Blood"" by two would-be thieves looking for something that doesn't exist. Capote's words make me feel sympathetic toward one of the murderers, Perry Smith, while--perhaps unintentionally--detesting the other, Dick Hickock. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book in the same way that I did Helter Skelter and To Die For, the latter being a fictional crime novel. However, I would recommend reading it before seeing Capote, because the film influenced my opinions of the book more than I thought it would."
4,One of the Better Ones,"I rather enjoyed this book. The author does a good job telling a story that is rather depressing and scary. Given the large amount of book in this class, his one stands out becuase of the writing. He have a very good flow through out the book and he is a master at describing the location and people involved. If you are to read a true crime book this is one of he better ones out there."
2,American Justice,"The problem with this book is that it tells the story Capote wants told, which differs significantly with some important facts. The cable TV series ""American Justice"" did an excellent documentary focusing on the Clutter murders. Hickock and Smith were far worse characters than depicted in the book, especially the latter. At his execution, Smith still was complaining about his sentence and had to be dragged up the scaffold steps. None of those interviewed who personally were involved in the criminal investigation and trial liked Capote's book."
3,TOO DETAILED,"Capote writes this book like a huge newspaper article. The novel lacks something that I can't quite put my finger on. Either his writing style is bland and personality free or the story is so cliched and typical that it's just tedious too stay focused on it. I agree with many reviewers who complained about the book's details being uninteresting and unnecessary too the plot. I did like the humanizing of the criminals however which I think many novels lack. I gave the book three stars because in hidesight (I read it 5 months ago) I think I learned something from this trite and overly detailed true crime story. (This is a very MIXED review, I know. Well, read the book just because it's a classic, although I'm not quite sure why this stands out in history above others.)"
3,A Novel off the beaten path,"I read this book along with a slew of other classic modern authors -- hemingway, fitzgerald, steinbeck -- as well as with classic japanese authors such as tanazaki.I guess I was expecting a fiction book from a fiction author, and instead got a rather long-winded book written with what seemed to be little imagination.As I read it, I realized that non-fiction does not lend itself well to imaginitive writing.So, while the book is well written and an 'interesting' change from fictional novels, I found it less interesting and suspenseful. I mean, the book starts with the slaying of the most interesting characters in the entire book. It is tough to recover into an 'interesting' story from that plot line.I will read other Capote books, but stick to his Fiction in the future.2 stars deducted for high ""boring factor""."
3,"A Good book, but a slow read!",This book was great in that it dealed really well with what went on in the murderers heads when they were killing the Clutter family. The only turn off to this book that I have is that it is a VERY slow read. It goes into so much unneeded detail that some of the pages are not even relevant to the story. I think that this book would of been better if there would of not been as many unneeded details dealing with characters that do not even need to be in the story. Truman Capote obviously knew a lot about this story and its murders and family. This bood is very moving and sad in knowing that these two men took the lives of a whole innocent family and did not feel any remorse at all. I am glad that in the end they got the punishment they deserved.
2,Depressing,"Though this book is well written, I just didn't have the stomach for it. If you love to look at the morbid side of life, however, this is your book. It forces you to look at ugly brutality, and even to empathize with nearly every character in the story including the killers. Truman Capote can write so well that you nearly feel you are them. But who wants to do that? Anyway, the book gave me nightmares, and I'm glad to be done with it, and now I will retreat into my nice happy place. Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, etc, I admit it I'm a wuss."
3,Book not for the young,My son has to read this book for school. It has murder and other adult stuff. Just know what u r getting
3,"""In Cold Blood""","In Cold Blood ia a book that is good for anyone who enjoys reading a murder mystery. The book, written by Truman Capote, was very hard to put down since he kept the reader wondering what would come next in the investigation of a family who was unexpectedly murdered by a shotgun This was a true story that happened in a small town in Kansas.The murder,investigation, capture, trial, and excecution are all events that keep the book interesting. Questions such as who and why made me wonder who could it have been. There were so many characters and possible suspects that it was also fun to try to guess who did it before the book revealed it. It was definately a facinating book and I think anyone who reads it would like it and want to finish ut."
2,"repetitive, confusing and dull.","I am relieved to find other reviewers had the same problems I did with this book. I am constantly confused where I am in the book. I alternate between feeling I already read a part, to feeling I missed something. Skipping sections and searching back occupy most of my time. Also, I would have liked some suspense."
4,"Intriguing and disturbing, well-written","This is a non-fiction account of a murder that reads like a novel. Capote writes this and develops the characters and plots as if he is creating the whole story. He writes a comprehensive journalistic account of all aspects of this murder. It is a very revealing book about the criminal mind and about community. It is a worthy book to read and was innovative for its time. Instead of reaching for the latest best-selling thriller, read this one first."
4,"Great, though old","I don't like classics but I liked this due to it being a true crime story. This was the book that suposily started the genre. It is very well written although I think Capote fictionalizes some aspects of the criminal characters to flesh them out more in the book. Some of the language used is old fashioned, but this was written in the 1950s so what can you expect."
5,A Triumph!,"This is the best thriller I've ever read, bar none. Capote's acclaimed ""non-fiction novel"" is just that: a true-crime masterpiece that turns ""immaculate facts"" into remarkable prose. It reads like a movie-in-prose with its numberless chapters and ominous intercutting between the lives of two pathetic drifters with those of their poignant victims. It's perhaps the best account of American violence ever written."
4,Interesting Epic,"This was a good book, although long but very insightful into the details of a real crime and its ramifications into the psyche of people. It comes really close to showing the complexities of human life and misery."
4,Great non-fiction writing.,"Excellent writing style. True crime can often be boring and a mere chronology of the facts, but Capote has excellent style. I gave it a four and not a five because I thought that Part II-Person Unknown was just a tad slow."
5,in cold blood,was received in excellent condition and delivered faster than I expected. I would definitely order other books from this source. My grandkids have a rigorous reading regimen in school and will need more books after the first of the year.
5,An American Masterpiece,"This is one of the best books I have read in my entire life. My only regret is that I did not read it sooner. This is a true crime masterpiece. Truman Capote painted a masterstroke with every page. He was able to capture this terrible and violent story in such a way that I do not believe that any other author could have done in a million lifetimes. The way he captured the image of that sleepy town, the family who was killed, and everyone involed in the crime from the killers to the investigators was nothing short of extrordinary. Mr. Capote remains un biased from beginning to end. This is a book I plan or reading many more times to remind me what great writing is all about. It was too bad Mr. capote never wrote another true crime piece again because I believe it was his true calling."
3,It's okay,Seemed a bit long in the tooth; plenty of extraneous info. Not bad over all - a rather anti-climactic ending.
5,I see why this is a classic!,A true story of horrific proportion (the brutal murders of a Kansas family) written in a style that puts one in the minds of the victims & criminals alike. A book that can not be put down from beginning to end.
3,"Good Read, Intense and Definitley Suspenseful","There were parts that were quite chilling and gruesome. Capote uses good detail and description. However, there were some areas of the book that ran rather slow, and could have used a 'little pick me up'. All in all though, a very good read."
2,"Good lord, I appear to be in the minority","As much as this book has been trumpeted, I found it rather tedious. Capote's stab at ambience journalism, while not irresponsible, rather leaves me cold. I suppose that Capote's tangential characters were well fleshed-out, but so unnecessary to the continuance of the story, I wondered if they weren't a bit overdeveloped. I should point out that, unlike the other reviewers, I did not use this novel as a springboard to develop opinions on the death penalty, so perhaps the major charm of the novel was wasted on me. I enjoyed ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" a tremendous deal more."
5,Masterly semi-fiction,Still chills. Is this the greatest account of a murder ever written? Probably yes. Capote is a master of atmosphere and character.
5,Great Book,Probably the greatest (and good book) that Truman Capote wrote. The movie is incredible as well. Enjoy:)
3,In Cold Blood,"This book is pretty good, Its considered a Nonfiction book since its based on the killings of the Clutters, but Truman did make up some of this stuff too. I watched a video about In Cold Blood, lemme tell ya, this Truman guy has the weirdest voice ever, and he has the 2 male killers in the book constantly calling each other 'Honey' and stuff... Its a pretty good attention getter for about the first half, but the last half gets kind of boring when Dick and Perry are being questioned and all that jazz."
5,It didn't have to happen,In cold Blood it was a terrible mishap to the Clutter family. The family was brutually murdered in their Kansas home by two outsiders for no apparent reason. Truman Capote brings the facts of this tradedy that happenend in 1959 to today's society. It was a thrilling novel with non-stop action In the end Perry and Dick finally get what they deserve and victory is unto the Clutter family.I highly recommend this novel. If you like thrilling action this definity is book for you.
3,A failed attempt at greatness,"The writing is excellent, the content is thrilling--but this account of a violent murder is forever tainted by the immoral approach of the author, who manipulated confessions for the sake of his book--and then gave a black and white party from the blood money. The author was a little man of enormous compromised talent. He never reached the potential he indicated early in his life. Sad, tragic."
2,How did this become a classic?,"Written well, but just not very interesting. I went out of my way to write this up (never did this before). Scott Brick did an fine job on the audio version of this, but it just isn't very good text..... I expected to be entertained, instead I fought my way to the end."
1,What a disappointment for me,"I was late to the party on this book. Some how in all my readings, I skipped it until now. It was so drawn out and boring I felt like I'd never get done. Maybe back in the day it was written it was shocking to have a cold blooded murder book to read, but there are many out there now extremely more exciting and interesting then this one. I'm not one for long descriptions and this book goes on for pages until he gets to the point.Tiny Dancer"
2,It has its' moments...but it ignores the reality of sin.,This book is well-written but it assumes too much about the minds of killers.
2,.......zzzzzzzzzzzzz.......BORING!!,This book is a bore! This book caught my attention not because of the Capote movie that came out but because of the rave reviews that were given here. I would have to say this is not a bad book but it's about 12 hrs of my life I will never get back. If I had to do it again I would have rather read something else all together.
2,This Book is OKAY,"In Cold Blood was okay book . I didn't really enjoy it very much for two reasons, one reason is because it was based on a true story and that those characters in the book were real and they didn't get to live. The people who did it seemed smart for almost puliing it off but were stupid for the action that took place. the second reason is that I usually read books that our gross and bloody with a lot of Blood spilling and slaughter and have a lot of murder mystery but this book was nothing like that , it took placce in a small town in kansas and it talked about the family that was savagely slaughter, they were shot in the face. It was a trgic story."
3,Not a fan,I bought this book for an AP English Language & Composition course summer reading. This was honestly the last novel I read front cover to back cover. It was a slow read as I'm not a fan of this genre.
3,In Cold Blood,"We read this for Book Club and concensus was we all enjoyed it, teaches you alot about the different characters we live with."
5,Great product great price!,"This seller said the product was in good condition, but it was great! The hard cover and the spine are in wonderful condition, unlike books that you would find in a public library. I have a high school student that needs this book for a summer reading project due on the first day of school. Thanks so much!"
5,As good as it was the last time I read it... 25 years ago,"This book chills me as an adult as it did and early teen. WOW, powerful writing!"
4,Good Book--Good Service,I have read the book before. This was a gift. The receipient was delighted with it. It came in a timely manner. The service I have received frokm Amazon has been consistently reliable.
4,Brutal Event in Journalistic Focus,This book is essentially a detailed and well-crafted piece of journalism with the level and quality of detail to bring it into horrific focus. One gets access to all sides of the murders of a family from the effect on the close relatives and friends to the emotional states of the murderers themselves and their final demise at the end of a rope. No one can escape this book without a large emotional wallop that will leave one's mind reverberating for some time. The book additionally invites questions concerning the limits and boundaries of journalistic integrity. When does the journalist step beyond his role as observer and become part of the story? And...Should the journalist do so and thus change outcomes? Disturbingly provocative in many ways.
5,A Sensational Masterpiece On a true account murder,"Truman Capote once again gives us another great American Classic to be proud of! In Cold Blood relates the story of 4 victims killed ""instantly"" by a shotgun. This book describes the family and their normal life and the process to which the criminals committed the crime and later were charged with murder. Truman Capote gives us a great sense of one of the most known murders in American History."
5,so far so good,"I just started reading this for my summer reading book for 11th grade English. I must say the juxtaposition in the beginning was new and led my first impression of Capote's style to be captivating. From other reviews I have read on this book, it sounds like ""The Stranger"" by Albert Camus- with the whole learn about the killer before you know their crime. Motives are also unleashed in both books. In addition, feelings on capital punishment can be altered (even if staunch)due to the psychoanalazations of the criminal minds."
4,Decent Book,We were not able to get this book locally neither in book stores or library so had to order and it was fantastic.
4,Read the book before the movie!,"This was a wonderful book, but I made the mistake of seeing the movie and then I had a biased. I enjoyed this."
4,Shocking,This is a shocking true account of 4 vicious murders by 2 total strangers. Capote really sets the scene with his descriptive words - you feel like you know exactly where they were and what they had done.
5,A Must Read,"I decided to read this book after discovering that the author was a childhood friend of Harper Lee, author of To Kill A Mockingbird. I had read that Ms. Lee was instrumental in researching this work of nonfiction. Though the book is about a gruesome multiple murder, its focus is on the relationship between the author and the two men who had been arrested for the murders and his search for the truth and motive through establishing a relationship with the alleged killers."
4,"slow start, but worth it",The first part of the book really dragged for both me and my husband (and we have pretty different tastes when it comes to books). I almost gave up. I gave it a go anyway and about 1/3 of the way through I couldn't put it down. It reads like fiction which is pretty scary since it's not. Capote was an excellent writer.
4,Anatomy of a murder,"'In Cold Blood' chronicles the murder of a small Kansas town family. Holcomb is a quiet small town in rural Kansas, which is rocked by the murder of a family. The murder is a shock to the small town and sends the locals into a state of fear. Who did this? The murder could still be in the area! The murder could be a local resident. A small town, used to keeping doors unlocked, is now paniced and paranoid.Capote disects the murder, the murders and the victims. He takes you into the lives of the families involved. From the victims, to the murders, to the investigators. It is a fascinating story and Capote's telling graps and holds the reader. 'In Cold Blood' was also a ground breaking book. Now it is common to find a 'true crime' novel, but this book set the stage for the books that followed."
4,Not a beach read,"This book was very well done and not for the lighthearted. If you do take this to the beach, put on lots of sunscreen because, you will not want to put this book down!"
4,good reading,"I purchased this book for my son ,. as one of his Summer reading assignments. He is going to give me the book to read, as soon as he writes his Report for it. The book arrived in good condition, in 4 days, just like they said it would..."
4,A True Classic,"Hadn't' red this book in decades. Was watching the movie ""Capote"" and wanted to read his book again. Forgot how gripping the storytelling is in this book."
4,indeed a classic,"I am a true crime fanatic and I though - you know- I never read where it all started - In Cold Blood - there are four parts - and part 2 I thought was a bit slow but the book as a whole is a must read for any true crime fan.What happened to the Clutter family was, excuse the phrase, but, a commedy of errors- in short, it should NEVER have happened -it was like they got killed by mistake - Truman Capote takes you through the minds of Dick and Perry and toward the end goes into a bit of other true crimes and it is terrifying to think that just being in the wrong place at the wrong time can cause a tragedy such as this.Everyone already said pretty much all there is to say about this book but suffice it to say - if you like true crime - you almost HAVE to read this book - its the bible of true crimes"
5,Well Worth It,"Truman Capote delivers a truely amazing (and shocking) look into the minds of killers. Although the content was sometimes hard to swallow, it was well worth it. Capote doesn't fail to leave out any details of any kind, and this is what makes the book so great. Capote creates great suspense and it's easy to read the book in one sitting. The only warning to give is that this book hits you really hard. Some parts are truly horrifying and seem so real that it feels like you're in the book. You befriend the victims...and the killers. But it's a book you'll never forget."
4,In Cold Blood,"Capote's depiction of the Cutter tragidy from the third person piont of view truly shows the horror of crime in our violent society. Many of the ideas including child abuse creating a violent crimmal where devloped before many criminal phsycologists had begun to research them. He has the ability to make the reader feel sympothetic of the stuggles of Perry's life and like him for his love of the arts and dreams of life, yet still creates a hatered for the man who killed four people for no reason. The image of the Nancy and the boy slaughtered is truely chilling after learning of there kindness and aspirations for life. Finally, his ability to show how the crime haunts some many people yet sadly and truthfully becomes forgotten in a society where violence is an all to comman occurance."
4,It makes you want to keep on reading!,In Cold Blood is a great book with intereting twists to the plot. The reason for the quadruple murders remains a mystery until later in the book. Interesting characters and very detailed descriptions of events.
1,Missing the last 20 pages,"Just finished my english composition class and we had to write a literary analysis on this book..I didnt realize until I tried to read the last part of the book that it was missing the last 20 or so pages.. Doesnt look like they were ripped out, looks like they were never in the book to begin with."
2,Painful,"I borrowed this book from my 14 year old neice for whom it was assigned reading. I was quite excited about it, too. Apparently its just me, but I found this to be a boring, painful read. As a booklover I could never understand why she didn't have the same joy in reading as I do. After suffering through this one, now I understand. I couldn't wait to finish it - not to see what was going to happen, just so it would be over. While I can appreciate it for the shocking, ground breaking novel it was back when it was originally published, I am of the opinion that many more interesting and better written true crime stories have been written since then."
2,I don't get it,"I'm disappointed- period. I truly feel as though the middle 200 pages could've been removed from this book and I would not have missed out on any importance, nor would I have noticed. I personally did not get much value out of this book. I wish I could have had a different experience.I feel I have been forced to seek out reviews that explain some deep-seeded theme that was completely fabricated by some ""scholarly"" reviewer, which the author never initially intended. Maybe that would satisfy me."
1,Good Idea but not worth the price,"I love the MP3 player but Disney really went awry with the speaker system. It is definitely of low quality, hard to use and really bad sound quality. It sounds better when played very low but what kid wants to play music on low sound. It gets screechy and grainy sounding once turned up. Parents certainly won't appreciate that! I would definitely search for a better speaker system that this could work with! Also, you have to push the player pretty hard to get it into the speaker system. I see the potential for kids to break the USB port off when trying to get it in there. The only neet thing about this player is the colorful light show that displays as the music plays."
1,Has never worked,"I bought this for my 5yo, hoping to win back my own mp3. The mix stick worked great for awhile, but it, too has cut out (purchased in July, quit by Sept). The jam stand has never worked- same problem as noted by other reviews. My husband got it to play for a few minutes one night, that's it. This is such a great idea, hope Disney will try again and get it right."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"This is a review of the sound quality only, and I am reviewing the 2004 remaster (mine's from Polystar Jazz Library in Japan).The sound quality here on some tracks is very bad. Tracks 3,6,&14 are definite 'Loudness War' victim (google loudness war for more info). Most tracks have limited dynamics, but on 3,6,&14 there is also clipping and a large amount of distortion. The sound really poor. Basically whoever remastered these three songs has ruined them. I mean this is a Jazz release of all things, why would anyone want to sacrifice sound quality for volume? Do you know anyone who listens to Jazz that doesn't value sound quality, even if only in a small way? or doesn't know how to operate their volume knob?I'd recommend getting the old pre-2004 version on cd, that's what I'm going to do (through the Amazon resellers of course). I'll post a review of that disk once I get it."
1,Not worth the plastic its printed on,"Wow was I duped on this one. Fans of really bad, white boys trying to be funky in some way may find a way to enjoy this, but gawd help you. Kinda like Beck at his worst. High school prom DJ's from very white suburbs might find some redeeming qualities. I couldn't even bring myself to sell it on Amazon (price so low) -- actually threw it away! Saved the jewel case for another CD though..."
1,Hip-crap,"Good god almighty, this albums [stinks] I listened to the samples before purchasing, thinking hmm, this might go great with my hip-hop collection. I could not have been further from the truth. This is the absolute worst ""rap"" album I've heard in ages. These guys don't have a clue about words, rhythms, rhyming, singing, or anything really. I guess at best this album is good background music, but certainly not good enough for even pre-show music at The Apollo."
1,This cd,"After reading the reviews here and hearing ""I'm doing fine"", I thought that I had found another unknown gem. Instead, I found one of the worst cds that I have purchased in years. I love Massive Attack and listen to them frequently. The only thing that Day One shares with Massive Attack is a record label and hometown. It is a disgrace to even mention them in the same sentence. ""I'm doing fine"" and maybe two other tracks are listenable, but songs like ""I'm in your life"" were so bad that I was embarassed to be listening to them. Do yourself a favor and pick up the single for ""I'm doing fine"" or else just completely skip over this band. You'll thank me later......"
1,Worse Than Ordinary,This is what happens when effete white sissy boys try to make hip-hop. Utterly without redemption.
3,im sorry,"im a fan of massive attack and irish folk music, but i couldnt even listen to this cd.i hate g love and special sauce, and this cd sounds VERY g love and special sauce. if i heard this on the radio i would think it was the new g love and special sauce.i heard the beastie boys produced this cd. maybe this is thier revenge on g love and special sauce."
5,Best fertilizer I've used.,"I've only been gardening for about 4 years and I have always used a USDA Certified organic fertilizer. I believe it was the fish/seaweed based fertilizer or what not. Finally, I switched to this and my plants are booming. But! No flowers on my tomatoes yet, they have been in the ground since early May. My tomatillos are blooming great, and my peppers are coming along strong. I have also picked a few cilantro plants. Not trying to boast or anything, just showing you what this fertilizer is capable of in a short growing season in Wisconsin. This is also my first time growing from seed and the plants are the strongest plants I have seen. Very happy with my plants this year.Unfortunately this fertilizer does not seem to be USDA certified organic. In my opinion if the product does not have the USDA stamp it is not legitimately organic... all personal preference."
5,FoxFarm Grow Big,"If you want your vegetables to grow, this is the fertilizer that actually works. You will see results the next day."
1,Got this from...,"I received this from warehouse deals and it was shot. The hour hand dangled and was broken upon arrival. It's a cute clock, but may not be suitable in the warehouse area."
3,too much glare,"It's pretty, and I love the bright color - perfect for my decor. However, the glass is rounded which makes the glare from any source of light quite unbearable. I can't read the time."
4,Dissapointed with color,"I bought this clock expecting a bright orange color. Instead, it is more like orange-cream. Just be aware of that, in case the right color is a must for you."
2,"NEON orange, not as pictured","I have no complaints about the design of this clock- but I will say that the orange is much much brighter in person. It is practically neon, and it was not what I expected at all. I am returning to exchange for a different color."
2,NOT HAPPY in Lockhart Texas,"FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS NOT A METAL CLOCK. It LOOKS kinda like metal, but it IS PLASTIC. I bought it specifically because it advertised itself as a METAL CLOCK so therefore I am disappointed. I will keep it only because it wasn't expensive, and because I had to rip up the packaging to free this plastic thing from its security backing -- which in itself was terrible. I have put the battery into the clock and am waiting to see if it even RUNS....."
5,Well made,"I bought this to go in my retro laundry room. It is not a cheap, throw away clock. It is all metal and solidly built. I was really surprised with the quality. I have seen plastic clocks selling for more than this one. I am very pleased with the clock and proud to put it in my newly remodeled room. If you want an instrument rather than a knock off, this is it."
3,Law & Mental Health Professionals - A Review,"The text is somewhat dated both in terms of law and clinical practices. Lawyes will find the text narrow in scope, but it can be useful as a guide as to where to begin looking and understanding the legal doctirnes. Clinicians will find the text lacking in detail. The text is only an overview, with not enough specific depth of coverage to act as a refernece for the clinician nor the lawyer. Useful for beginners just starting out in their clinical practices."
3,"A nice cd, but soo similar to suavemente",I bought this cd very soon after it came out. DIdn't anyone notice how the lyrics and beats were almost exactly the same as Suavemente?? i still like it. dance away!!
2,"""Merengue a medias""","It is a shame that after the international hit ""Suavemente"" the following Elvis Crespo's albums have not the same quality. Nowadays, E.C. is considered one the greatest merenge singers; however, the quality of his albums is decresing (""Pintame"" is an example)."
5,Elvis does it again with his catchy tunes! GO GET IT!,"It's definitely hard to follow up an album as huge as Suavemente was, but Elvis does it. It's even harder to accept anything less then what Suavemente was to you, but if you really liked Suavemente, you will definitely like Pintame. Pintame is my favorite track in this cd, but all the other songs stick with you after the first time around. You'll like this one too!"
2,Wake up people!,How could people start calling this guy the king of merengue. Get real there only two kings of meregue and they are Juan Luis Guerra and Fernando Villalona. Although Villalona is not so famous as Guerra his voice is something from another world. His voice is so soft and there is no singer of merengue that can be compare to him when we are talking about a live concert. When villalona is singing live he sounds the same as the cd. So my conclusion is if you really want to listen merengue you should listen to the real king Fernando Villalona. And there no doubt about that.
1,My God How I Hate This Guy,Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate Hate
5,The best Merengue songs I ever heard.,As a new fan I would like to say that this one of the best records of Elvis Crespo so far. The fast upbeat makes me want to move and the words gives me the inspiration to find that special girl to love. I really can't wait for next cd to come to the market.
3,The Most Overrated Merengue Album in My Lifetime (25 Years),"What helped this album's popularity is that it rode on ""Suavemente's"" wings. It sounded too much like it. It was released too soon after Suavemente. It also seems that when Suavemente was made the 10 best songs are picked and 50 weeks later, the leftovers where thrown in it's own album; Pintame. The the blame for this album was put on Wow Flash, a much better album. Sony Discos goes too far to please I don't know who to earn a buck; stop forcefeeding barely bilangual kids in the States this Spanglish [....] Please, no more remixes. It kills me when one of Crespo's songs are nominated and they put that mediocre club version. [....]"
3,Oh well..........,"It seems that the best song he ever made was ""suavemente"" I mean the rest of his music are o.k. But it seems like all of his songs sound the same. I'ts just like Oro Solido said, that most of the puerto rican merengueros ""SUENAN LO MISMO"" Yes I'm a huge merengue fan (hasta la tambora) and the only thing that would impress me is if they would use more of their own styles ""stop copying"" from each other................"
1,UN FRACASO,Elvis no tuve lo que tenia en SUAVEMENTE. Este Cd en verdad solo tiene una buena cancion la cual es Pintame. Despues de esa todo va de bajada. Malo el cd
3,PUDO HABER SIDO MEJOR,"EN LO PERSONAL PIENSO QUE EL CD PUDO ESTADO MEJOR. MUSICALMENTE HABLANDO LOS ARREGLOS ESTAN UN POCO COMPLICADOS, EN ALGUNOS MOMENTOS SE APRECIAN CORTES DE POP, Y A VECES LA CANCION ESPECIFICAMENTE EL MAMBO O LA PARTE MAS BAILABLE NO LOGRA EXTENDERSE A LO MAXIMO COMO EN EL DISCO ANTERIOR. PIENSO QUE VOCALMENTE ELVIS NO HIZO UN BUEN TRABAJO, EN VEZ DE SONAR MEJOR SUENA COMO UN PRINCIPIANTE COMO SI ESTE FUERA SU PRIMER CD."
3,even if you don't speak Spanish you'll like this one,"I bought this album on a whim. I was not dissapointed. My Spanish is sketchy at best, but the Latin beat of this music compounded with a presence that even comes across in a recording makes this a record one can truly listen to. From the first time I put this in the cd player I couldn't stop dancing. If you can stand still to this record--especially to Pintame--you must truly be braindead!"
2,un refrito de SUAVAMENTE,"this cd sounds exactly like the first one...and must he say ""oye nena hechate pa'ca"" in every song! hello...annoying? segunda partes nunca fueron buenas."
5,"AmorRican@hotmail.com , A DomiRican girl","Hey i'm also wondering, what cd is ""Adios, esto es muy triste"" is on? Well n-e-wayz, ELVIS u r it! i met him on a plane, and he is a sweet heart!"
5,"One of the best blues albums, period",The first time I listend to this album I was blown away. Larry is a true blues great. The album shows his unbelievable range for the genre. I highly reccomend seeing Larry live. His entire band are truly great blues musicians and his brither is an AMAZING percussionist. The enegrgy level at his live shows is amazing.
3,70's comics on TV,I remember seeing shows like this on TV. Superheroes like the hulk and thor fighting and unanimated like cut outs. I liked them but this was done pretty well. Nostalgic video.
1,Please don't subject yourself to this,"This is terrible but that seems to be the trend with the video games nowadays, just don't watch it, just bad."
2,low quality,"The plastic caps that look like metal fall off and inside you will see rust and gook that you had no idea about, building up over the weeks/months. Give it a little bit more time and the whole handle will start falling off them. AWFUL"
2,You pay for what you get,"I purchased the flatware when I moved in my new home. ( at least 5 months now) Sadly I have to agree, that they are not sturdy. I had a knive break on me while making my son a sandwich. They are my favorite utensils,however, they don't last long. And since they are not at all expensive........... you pay for what you get."
1,VERY CHEAPLY MADE,"I am very unhappy with this set. First the end caps fall off, which can be reglued. Then the plastic handles crack, chip, or just falt out shatter. I had a knife handle shatter when I was was cutting into a moist cake!! I hand washed and dishwasher washed them, like their instructions say is allowed. Just normal use breaks them!! I wouldn't suggest these to anyone!!"
2,"Pretty, but not sturdy.","While they are very pretty and comfortable, they are not the sturdiest. Mine started falling apart after about 6 mos. Yes, yes, it is plastic, so it's inevitable. As long as it's not your only set of silverware, it's a nice addition. Caddy is a neat bonus, plus it's metal."
1,Don't buy these,"Yeah, my husband and I thought these were cool when we purchased them a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, this flatware set does not stand the test of time. We bought two sets and after two years, we have about half of the pieces left. They break apart where the clear plastic meets the metal. Of the pieces we do have left, I don't think there's one that doesn't have a lose head. Unless you're only going to use them for a special occasion (which is probably not likely) I would not recommend this set."
3,"Disappointing audio quality, but oh, the memories!","""Now Is the Caroling Season"" was one of the first LP's my parents bought for me. It was Christmas 1958 that I first played this album and all the pleasant feelings of that time came back - the blood pressure is a little lower when this music plays.The only problem is the LP-to-digital conversion quality. The audio level is too low and the 60-hertz hum is high enough to be noticeable. If the audio level was higher, the volume in Media Player could be turned down to mask the hum. Frankly, I've done better in my living room dubbing old LP's to my laptop using a $20 A-to-D device from ebay. I can clean the sound up with Audacity, but I shouldn't need to do that. Somebody didn't get it right the first time.It was only a few dollars so you get what you pay for, but a little attention to the basics of the dubbing process would be in order (proper level, no ground loops) when bringing back such memories."
2,Disappointed Hewson Fan,"I have read all of Hewson's ""Nic Costa"" books and sadly have to say that I was disappointed in this one. I am no fan of the CIA, but the plot line to me was unbelievable. I don't want to give the plot away and spoil the book for others, but this book reads like a failed John Le Carre ""wanna be"". It also read like an obvious attempt to leverage off the (to me) hideous Da Vinci Code book, with references to ""symbology"" that go nowhere. The significance of the ""cut"" is never adequately explained or, if it was, I missed it. I also see shades of Hannibal Lechter here. The Roman background and the description of the history of the Pantheon constitute the ""saving grace."" Take it out of the library, if possible. Otherwise, forget it. It adds nothing to the development of Nic Costa as a character or as a detective."
4,Hooked,"Discovered by chance ""a season for the dead"" and enjoyed the characters: they are ""real"", complex, they hurt (and they're hurt), they laugh, they love, they die... and Rome is a character on its own. So went on to buy ""The Villa of Mysteries""... and that's it: I am hooked! Sacred Cut is the 3rd in a serie that gets better and better.Real characters again, a real love of Italy - a perfect combination for me.I just went on to buy them all on Kindle so I can just keep on reading the wonderful adventures of Nic Costa."
5,"Hewson is a ""cut"" above the rest! :-)","Hewson's writing is engrossing. Early in the series, the characters will win you over and by this book, A Sacred Cut, their trials and tribulations really matter to you. That makes this dangerous, intriguing, multi-layer mystery all the more enjoyable.In short, great book by a great author!"
2,"""TMI""","I can honestly say that this is one of the first crime mystery novels that I didn't care for. It was extremely hard for me to get into the fast reading, page turning, want to know more mode. The story line was well thought out, but I just couldn't seem to follow with enthusiasm. The main reason why is because Hewson used too many adjectives. Every character, it seemed like, had over ten adjectives that described them. It left nothing to your imagination. I couldn't seem to get interested and finally put the book down halfway through."
1,Very poor,"Nic Costa, the purported hero, must be the least interesting Italian male on the planet. The heroine is an impressively boring and dim American. The appealing setting, Rome during a snowstorm, is ground to death. The interesting plot idea quickly dissipates, the perp being revealed early on. His motivations are repeated, confusingly, ad nauseam; they remain incomprehensible at the end. The fate of some characters, including one of the bad guys, is left unresolved.Another distracting note is that Hewson doesn't know enough about the American language to be writing from our viewpoint. Usage and spelling are wrong throughout. Spelling might be excused, but not usage--when the voice is American."
2,"Hard to follow, hard to connect","Ar some point, a story has to ""set its hook."" You have to get interested. Alas, The Sacred Cut, by David Hewson, never gets to that point. From characters that are hard to follow in the context of the story, to a Kurdish refugee who is inserted into the story for I don't know what reason, to a ho-hum ""confusing lines between bad guys and good guys"" type plot, The Sacred Cut never really takes off.Can't win them all."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first David Hewson book I have read. I was very disappointed. The dialogue is very stilted and unatural. People just don't ""yell"" that often. The shifting point of view is confusing. If the flyleaf hadn't identified this as a ""Nic Costa"" thriller, I wouldn't have known he was the main character. The plot is a stretch and the story line is hard to follow.I live in Wisconsin. It doesn't snow continuously here for three days in a row, so I find it hard to believe it might happen in Rome."
3,Not an easy read or listen,"I listened to this book on CD format. The readers voice was too low to hear at times, forcing me to back-track and turn it up. Not recommended for listening if you are driving.The ""blurbs"" from reviewers caused me to think this was a ""puzzle"" type story. It was compared to ""Di Vinci Code"". I have no idea why. This is just a murder mystery set in Rome. There are no religious overtones at all. The author tried to link in some ancient Roman history but, all that did was take up space in the story-line. It was more closely tied to modern times, with a de-ranged killer. Desert Storm plays a role.All in all, a good book, but, not one I'd pay full price for."
4,Nice starter label maker,"I have always wanted an electronic label maker, so I finally ended up buying the QX50. It has a lot of features that make it nice. It has four different print sizes - the first three are 1/8"" height, in varying widths, and the large mode is 3/16"" height. It has a two line mode, which shrinks the type so that both lines occupy 3/16"" height, combined. It is capable of printing in various type styles, including reversed, which is very handy when using the clear tape which is available. The metallic tape is useful for outdoor applications, and the plastic tape is very versatile. The paper tape is more economical, and handy for labeling folders, etc. I have used this label maker for everything from labeling my mailbox, to video tapes, electrical plugs underneath our aquarium, cable lines coming into our splitter/amplifier, etc."
2,Iron On Labels,I bought the this manufacturer label maker specifically because they make iron on labels. After just one wash the labels for my child's clothes are already fading! I am curious if anyone else has this experience. For me it has not worked as anticipated and has been a let down.
2,:(,"There are newer and better books. I bought this super cheap hoping it would at least have some value...Nope. Old, very outdated, stay away..."
2,DID not work as described! on mold/mildew,"Ok this will work on fresh spots, not older ones! I got this for a shower door in a house we bought that obviously the previous owners did not clean well. DID nothing to the mold around the door frame. Not even lighten it! I ended up using plain bleach, alot of scrubbing and then found a product from Menards by Rubbermaid that is a mildew/mold spray and that does work. Yes it has bleach in it too and smells, but so did this! I used it to clean just regular soap scum and it kind of worked. Still not worth it. I gave it to my neighbor to use on outdoor furniture and she got nothing too so....will not be ordering again."
1,Product good vendor worthless,"It really has to get me riled to write a review, but this vendor succeded. I have used the product for years with excellent results. Unfortunately the vendor sent me some very, very old product. So old that they were actually past their shelf life of 2 years. Instead of being dry powder crystal the contents of the packets were a slimy worthless gel. Next time I will buy direct from the manufacturer. The entire order wasn't bad; however, the plastic bottle seems to be OK."
5,Miracle in a bottle,"I bought this solely for RV roofs, primarily the type with white fuzzy carpet like material. I tried bleach, Oxi-clean, carpet cleaner, etc. with no result. After searching on the internet, Instagone was mentioned. Was worth a shot. It really works ! Can barely see the stains. Careful where you spray it and not to breath it in though."
1,Ok for some items,"Seen the commercial and thought, wow. That stuff looks amazing. Up until I had bought myself some. Tried it on my boat. Fiberglass and vinyl seats. There were some rust spots. Did absolutely nothing. Did not work. Started walking around my house to see what it will work on. Tried my vinyl front door. Results were so so. Tried it on my exterior window sills. Again so so. Maybe I was expecting a miracle. Some soap and water with a little elbow grease would have accomplished the same. Don't let the commercial fool you."
1,Did not do as advertised,"After reading all the wonderful reviews, I decided to buy it for my bathroom tub. Other than the fact that the smell was unbearable, which I was ready to accept, the product did nothing to the few stains I had in my tub under the mat. Hope it works for others (and it looks like it does); but unfortunately, it did not work for me"
1,"Bab Stuff from ""As seen on TV products""","Product was supposed to be two packages of powder and a bottle. When received the two packages of powder was wet mush and one had broken and was all inside of the box. Contacted a very nice person at Instagone and he informed me that I was not the first to complain to them. It seems that ""As seen on TV products"" was selling their Instagone that was 8 years old. He was nice enough to replace the two packages and it worked as advertised. Never again will I buy anything from ""As seen on TV products""."
1,fell apart,"The Da Vinci Aluminum Poker Chip Case is of the poorest construction quality. After only two weeks, the felt is coming undone. Furthermore, the bottom board where the poker chips sit is made of several small pieces which are not even glued to the case. They move around making the case look raggedy. I'm embarrassed to be seen with it. Come on they could have used one board piece to cover the bottom. Don't buy the Da Vinci Aluminum Poker chip Case. Amazon.com they are makig you look bad. I'm disgusted with the Producdt!!! I'm even begining to loose faith with Amazon.com for allowing such bad products to be sold through them. It looks bad Amazon.com."
2,Be aware of what you are getting.,"Be aware of what it is that you are buying. The seller (not Amazon) that I bought a 300 Chip case from claimed that it was a Da Vinci case. According to the Da Vinci Imports website ([...]); all of their cases have a solid wood, one-piece chip tray. The case I received had a cheap, flimsy plastic tray.I'm not saying that ALL the cases available in this listing are not what they claim; just the one I got from one seller. I'll probably try again in the future. Hopefully I'll get the right case next time."
2,The Da Vinci chip case is low quality.,"The 750 chip case I purchasd is very flimsy and cheaply made. I would not have ordered it if I had known the quality. I purchased a 500 chip set a few years ago with chips and all included that was a much better quality case and the whole set cost only about $50, so I was really disappointed.Lucily, I do not plan to carry it much or I do not believe it would last. I maimly got it to store more poker chips in here at home."
1,Low quality compared to others around the same price,"Got this product and put my chips in it. First thing I noticed was that the separators are a flimsy plastic that is spray coated (or something like that) with a felt type of coating. This is pretty flimsy and could easily crack or bend. The second thing that happened was that one of the feet broke off when I set it down after putting all my chips in it. I noticed that all the feet and the protectors are made of plastic and not rubber. After these two things, I started looking at the details closely. Here are a few other things that stick out:- The edges don't seal completely when closed. This seems like a hinge problem- The rivets and rounded corner pieces look thin and could end up breaking- The egg crate foam isn't attached and can be easily pulled out (not a huge issue but goes to the overall construction quality)"
2,Sent a Damaged product,"It's made of basic and cheap aluminum, fine. Not completely worth the $30 but will do the job i need it to do. The problem:Was sent to me damaged. There are bends and scratches all over this thing as soon as I opened up the box. The box wasn't damaged. So it was placed in damaged. Case didn't close all the way and latches don't match up. Whomever packaged this could have easily seen this, but was ignored. I know it's aluminum, couldn't i at least be the first person to jack this thing up?"
1,aweful,"The case itself is good, the locks are cheap. I will be ordering a good case next time. If your going to use this a lot id recommend being careful with the locks."
4,"Good, but needs updates","We found the guide useful while in Ecuador, but routes have changed on some of the peaks (Iliniza Norte, Chimbo). Definitely buy the book, but once in country talk to guides or South American Explorers Club about changes."
5,"Fast, Easy to use, Never lose your cap!",I have a few different UPB Flash Drives - but this one by far is the best! It is so reliable and with the USB 2.0 it's fast. But what I love best about this item is the fact that you just can not lose the cover! It's all in one! I am amazed that others don't offer this feature. I highly recommend this item. In fact I've just bought another one - but with 4gig space.
5,Essential Godard,"As a Godard fan I would rank this film ahead of some of his other higher profile films. It is a much more impressive cinematic experience than Le Petit Soldat, Bande a Part, Le Chinoise or Masculin Feminin. The story (basically a sociological study, not a psychological one) is concise and focused. Coutard's cinematography is surpassed perhaps only by Contempt and Prenom Carmen. What is truly amazing is this film went through pre-production, filming, editing to completion in under 30 days! The DVD has no extras but the transfer looks amazing."
3,Dishonourable Proposal,"From the back of the book: ""No teenage crush, Katy'slove for Jake Granton was as real as the searing hearbreak of his betrayal. After four years of modeling-and all the male attention a woman could possibly want-she'd actually convinced herself she was over him. But when she left the limelight and joined the family business, Jake was waiting for her, his possessive kiss reducing her to a mass of aching desire. His reputation as a businessman was ruthless, but his proposition was all out blackmail: become his mistress or her company would suffer the consequences. My fav Baird is Master of Passion. Other authors like Baird are Graham and Bianchin."
3,"In the end triumphant, but sad","In reading Cao's memoir I admired him and his family, yet at the same time did not come to feel close to them until near the end. When he told of his sister's assignment to the countryside and the desperate measures taken to bring her back to Shanghai, then I began to experience a sense of anguish, along with him. In the early parts of the book I felt a distance from the family: I did not get a sense of the fear that must have gripped the family as they sought refuge in Shanghai,and their subsequent relief, despite their--to an American--very harsh circumstances. For five people to bathe, cook, sleep, work in an attic is beyond our grasp. As the author described his dispairing and brave sister, his parents experiencing the effects of age, a quarrel over good fortune, the memoir at last came alive to me. I appreciated the author's sharing his memories; still, for most of the book, I remained an observer. I can't say exactly why."
1,sick and hideous,"without warning, the author lauches ito a detailed a d horrible accou t of how to torture, kill a d eat all sorts of a imals, both dead a d alive. A sick example of gratuitous viole ce."
1,sick and hideous,"without warning, the author launches into a detailed, hideous account of how to torture, kill and eat all manner of animal, both alive and dead. A horrible example of gratuitous violence."
5,The best!,"Very relaxing. takes your mind of the work and stress. I can listen this CD anywhere, in car, at home while cleaning/cooking, or at my office."
2,It's wrong to detract from the original legacy.,"The Seven per-cent Solution, by Nicholas Meyer could have been a great addition to the extended legacy of Sherlock Holmes. Sadly, Meyer makes several errors and plot turns that take his book from a potentially interesting concept to an almost blasphemous book of lies.Meyer deals masterfully with Holmes's cocaine addiction by taking him through detox in the home of Sigmund Freud. During his reovery, he and Watson stumble into a mystery which ends with a stunning ly written train chase and fight.Unfortunaely Meyer deflates the legendary Professor Moriarty and in the process rewrites the History of Sherlock's death and disappearance."
3,Violencia masculina en el hogar,"Es un buen intento de tratar el tema de los hombres que ejercen violencia, se pierde mucho en el anecdotario, y hay menos teoría, y sistematización de la experiencia de lo que hubiera deseado. Sí hay mucha información sobre casos de hombres maltratadores. Está muy bien enfocdo desde el enfoque de género y violencia familiar."
4,Super Pet Goofs Again,"I doubt that I'd have purchased this had I been able to inspect it first, but I bought it online, so...This clever and well-designed item's desirability is limited by its having been manufactured from extremely hard, brittle plastic. This will undoubtedly result in its early demise (forgive me for personifying here), which, even for an inexpensive item, is frustrating (especially if replacements aren't readily available offline). The scoop I use for my cats' litterbox is much more durable; why Super Pets didn't go the extra mile is beyond me. How much more could it have added to the per-unit cost?My experience with this company's products, although limited, has been disenchanting. I intend to avoid them in the future."
5,Beats the hell out of most of today's tired musical recipes,"Tired of mindless pop, twangy drown in your beer country and rage rock? Would you like music that is technical, polished and has complex rhythms? (well they are to me)Try this stuff. The lyrics are off the wall and bizzarre too. I like ""Earth to Doris"" only because I crack up every time I hear it. Ever notice that David Was (Weiss) sounds like the Billy Mumy of Lost in Space and ""Fish Heads"" fame?I turned my husband on to this. He loved it and asked for more. I only had one more: ""Are you okay."" Find that one too. I hope they're still playing music somewhere."
5,Forgot how great this CD is!,"I was cleaning out some old CD's and picked this one up. I hadn't listened to it in a long time and figured I'd give it to my ex-husband, since I knew he liked it way back when. Well, on the way to his house, I listened to it in the car. By the time I got there, I had decided to keep it! I forgot just how great this CD is. Really great stuff. My youngest loves ""Walk the Dinosaur"", ""Robot Girl"", and ""Dad I'm in Jail"". You can't get ""Spy in the House of Love"" out of your head. Very groovable. You really want to move to this music. Great writing too... ""11 mph"" is great, as is ""Somewhere in America there's a Street named after my Dad""."
3,A little too big and stiff,"The collar looks really nice - however it's a little too big and my cat is able to take it out herself in a couple of minutes. I also found the glowing part a little stiff - maybe not too comfortable for my cat. Anyway, if your cat is a little over-weight, it may work perfectly! (my cat weights 9 pounds... not that small)"
4,Great cat collar,"Glows in the dark, reflective and good quality. Gave it 4 stars because my cat's long hair covers most of the collar. Wished the collar could be more thicker."
4,Love the glow collar,"This is a great idea. I don't have to worry about stepping on my cat when I walk around the house with the lights off. Only problem is my cat has a med size neck (from other custom collars I've ordered)and this collar is very large. I had to move the black plastic buckle to the middle of the ""plastic glow band"" in order to fit my cat. The glow part is plastic and stiff, so the buckle doesn't easily adjust to fit smaller cats."
5,No more tripping over the cat!,"I originally bought this collar for my indoor cat in case she ever got loose. She's an all black cat and we live above a highway, so I was particularly afraid that one night she would run out there and that would be the story of her.But after having the collar on her for a few days I quickly realized another positive aspect of it. We can see her at night in the house too! No more stepping on kitty in the middle of the night. The glowing stripe is also a tell tale sign of where she's at and whether or not she's going to try and make a go for the door when I come home late.This collar has prevented a lot of hassle for both me and kitty."
1,AVOID Product -- Total GARBAGE,"I bought 3 of these collars, in different colours; first one came off in first two days and was lost along with rabies and I.D. tags. I checked the other two, both opened with almost NO effort, less than 2-3 lb of effort. Snap closure definitely DEFECTIVE."
2,Meh,"It was okay the first day, but the material doesn't give at all, so when my cat grew and the collar needed to be resized it never really fit well again (the material is too dense to re conform itself). The reflective material worked well though. I wouldn't recommend the collar for a growing cat."
2,It was disappointing,"The collar looked great online but when it arrived, I was disappointed to see that it was very stiff and that reflective strip on the collar does glow but the collar itself is hard and uncomfortable. The bell too is very loud and the break free buckle is cheap. We had to buy another one. Fortunately found one at Walmart - half the price but much more comfortable with a delicate bell."
2,The Great Escape,"My cat seems to be able to work his way out of any collar that doesn't have a buckle and this one was no exception. Within half an hour, I had put it back on him four times. I would imagine that the glow in the dark feature would be good for cats who go outside, but, since mine doesn't, that wasn't a plus for me. Even if he were an outdoor cat, the glow in the dark part wouldn't help if he constantly shed the collar.Would I buy this collar again? No."
3,Works I suppose,"The bell falls of easily all the cats that I got a collar for managed to lose the bell somehow within 24 hrs of putting the collar on. The glo-in the dark feature was great for our short haired feline crew, but on our long haired the collar disappeared under his mane, although little patches of the neon shone through the hair in the dark it was not enough for a safety feature, fortuately the cat in question rarely wanders out after dark."
1,Quality was terrible,"I purchased this collar for my cat less than 2 months ago. It started getting pretty fuzzy after only a week, which isn't that big of a deal since she does scratch at it, but then her jaw got stuck on it. Don't ask me how, all I know is she was licking her chest and then her tongue or jaw got stuck on the fuzzy material. I had to throw it away. Wasted money in my opinion. My cat has had many nylon collars and has never had this problem."
2,Kept coming off-A collarless cat is NOT the point of this purchase!,"The reflectiveness on this collar is great but it loosens up constantly and the snap does not stay snapped. I started finding the collar various places in the house, not attached to my cat...which doesn't do much good now does it? I had to get a different one that actually would stay on..."
4,Worth buying,"Noticeably cuts down on wind and noise. The item sent to me was black, as advertised. It did not have flaps coming down the neck as shown in the picture."
5,Don't let this one get away.,Couldn't put it down. What a great visit to Loon Lake and all the memorable characters that Houston has created. Left me axiously waiting for the next book in the series.
5,Northwoods Mystery,"Once again Ms Houston has captured her audience with the delightful trio: Lew, Doc and Ray. This adventure was intrigueing through out. Being a Northwoods Mystery lover I look forward to the next Loon Lake Mystery. Please keep this wonderful series going."
4,A must have album for every 'Seattle Sound' fans,"This album is a great record! This is the ONLY Malfunkshun album ever recorded. Every recording on this album are pretty much like ""early"" Mother Love Bone demos. This record is also pre-Devilhead and pre-Satchel. This is way before Pearl Jam existed. Track 6 is the live version of Ted Nugent's ""Wang Dang Sweet Poontang"". The bonus track on this album which is Track 33 is the live version of ""With Yo' Heart, Not Yo' Hands"". Tracks 13 through 32 are just that ""annoying"" blank CD like the Nine Inch Nails 'Broken' EP. I highly recommend this album to every Pearl Jam fans, old or new. Every Pearl Jam fans MUST have this album even if it may be difficult to find. It's worth the hunt though."
2,Recorded too late,"When it comes to Malfunkshun, the earlier the material the better. Their tracks on the Deep Six compilation album (circa 1985) were very cool; sounded like T Rex meets Discharge. But this later stuff... this sounds like ""random glam band"" meets ""suck."" Still much better than anything Mother Love Bone ever did, though. I saw a track listing somewhere that seemed to indicate that there were over 20 tracks on this disk, but apparently this version only has these 13. These 13 aren't worth it, but there maybe an expanded version with the older stuff tacked on."
3,Fairly Helpful,"This is a competent guide for new students of Heidegger, though it is necessarily crude to have to simplify and reorganize his thinking. The chapter death, time, and history is probably the most helpful, for it is some of Heidegger's most challenging material. Also included are essays on Heidegger's thoughts on psychotherapy, ecology, Buddhism, and technology. Although the essay on Heidegger's politics is fairly amateurish. An average text on the whole."
3,Good old movie.,This is an older movie...I loved it when it came out in the theater...love it just the same.And now...I can watch it anytime I want.
5,Movie,I purchased the movie for a friend & he liked it very much & I appreciate the prompt service. I have purchased 2 other items recently & was very satisfied with the service for each purchase
2,leaky pads,These pads are not the best made and sometimes the cotton pad is not even covering the bottom plastic liner. I have also experienced the pads leaking under and onto the wood floor-yuck! This happens within minutes of the puppy going to the bathroom! I have used another brand of pads and NEVER had this problem.
2,"They're okay, but I won't use again","While the dogs used them, they didn't do well in absorbing, cut down on tracking, and the urine odor was always there. I bought new pads and they work much better."
2,Just ok,The word economy is a good indication of what you get...you know the old saying...you get what you pay for. I thought these were REALLY flimsy compared to the regular training pads. I now opt to pay more for the regular ones because I actually use less so I feel like I break even monetarily...and I avoid having to clean up what leaks through.
2,Thoughts on this book,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I guess for a non-musical person, it does okay. I may have expected more on how to compose music and/or come up with tunes. It failed me on those counts. Illustrations were good though."
4,An Inspiring Product,"My two-year-old was there when I opened the package containing this book. After five minutes of looking through the new book with me, she was inspired to pick up a large leaf and place it under her chin. She took a stick and began rubbing it back and forth across the leaf. ""I'm playing my viola,"" she said. The really funny scene was when she tried to pretend a guitar case was a double bass. The pictures are really great for kids. I think they could have chosen nicer music for their cd. The Witches Chorus is rather overpowering. The instrument examples sound electronic to me. The charts of music history is confusing. Incidents in each period seem to have been picked at random rather than for their overall importance to the period. It isn't really a general overview. However, I still like the book. The strong point is that it gives children a good introduction to the instruments. It is entertaining."
3,eh,"bought this cd because diplo worked so closely with MIA, that i thought it had to be good. it's okay. a little boring and non-descript -- there are probably only 2 songs that i really like a lot."
4,Varied sizes,"This is a canister of bungee cords in many different sizes, including a few very small ones and a few that have balls on the end. So if you're looking for variety, get these. This assortment probably included 6-8 bigger ones. They held up well through the project we bought them for; no complaints here!"
5,Just what I needed,I bought these to hold down the tarps on our pop up camper and patio set for the winter. They work wonderfully and are very versatile.
5,great bungees,these are great bungees and are stronger than the typical dollar store bungees. i actually got a set of these for my son who loves to tow things around the yard with his toy tractor
4,Good Assortment,"The quality of the cords seems to be what you would expect. I used them last night to secure a barrier and they are holding up well. I just wanted a few cords for use around the house, to secure my bicycle to the rack on the car, and to secure items in the basket on my bicycle. These will work fine for that.Like the other reviewers mentioned, I wasn't really sure what cords would be in the package.3 mini3 18""2 24""1 32""1 40""2 canopy ties"
4,It is what it is,"A plastic jar full of bungee cords, what else can I say? Cords are of mediocre strength (as expected for the price), I wouldn't hold anything incredibly expensive with these. They're handy for light camping, though."
4,Good set of cords of assorted sizes,"I bought these to have on hand for camping and they've definitely come in handy. The various sizes are very convenient. Appear to be good quality, no problems yet."
1,Annoyed,"I had my first experience with a raccoon a few months ago. I was sitting in my living room after the kids had gone to bed and realized there was one knocking down my garbage cans and attacking out garbage. I tried everything, pounding on the window, throwing a water bottle onto the porch it would not leave. SO I jumped on Amazon and ordered bungee cords, to keep my cans closed. I did not realize at the time that my cans do not have handles on both sides, which wouldn't really matter because there were holes that could hold the books and reach over to the handles. NOT with these granted there are different size cords, none would fit my cans, they are all too small or too big and even the extension pieces were not enough. If you need these for anything else I recommend, they are strong and not cheap at all, but for me they were a no go."
1,Very misleading image used for this product,"I thought this was a good deal based upon the photo. Reality is you only get one of the items shown (the tube with a red ""12"" on it). Just a warning to anyone else that thinks they are getting everything pictured."
5,Handy Item,"This item eally comes in handy for tying down tarps, etc. The various sizes are a plus for having around the house."
3,Not as good as cheap ones I got at a store,"Oddly, these are not very stretchable. I have some totally regular ones I picked up at some hardware store long ago, the archetypal variety that everyone thinks of when you say ""bungee cord"", and those stretch and continue to stretch, and the fact that they always stretch further than you think they will is what makes bungee cords so cool and so useful. I did a stretch comparison the other day. These ones in this here plastic jar stretch less than half as far, and then sort of reach a wall: they won't stretch any farther. They stretch only about 6 inches (more for longer ones, less for shorter ones).3 stars, because they're fine if you don't need them to stretch very far. But I'm not interested in having such a bungee around."
3,Ahhhh Becket !,"Great historical events that happened too too long ago are difficult to not only research but also to put into print with any new information. The evidence is all gone, any observers or participants are long gone and there are certainly no pictures of events before, say, the mid to late 1800s. This book suffers from that but I must tell you that if anyone is even marginally interested in the Becket/Henry story this is one of the ""must reads"". It is not only one of the few classics about the subject but it is one of the better ones. If one is looking for great literature of course this is not it but if you enjoy the era, like the history and need to know more about it this is a clear ""must read"".It's an older book with older syntax but that does't affect the truth. It's a style that won't turn you off and my wager is that at the end of it you will be glad you opened it up in the first place.Good reading !"
2,Dangerous,I bought this after purchasing a new pillow-top mattress that is very high off the floor. It's a really pretty piece but the finish was so slippery that it felt dangerous to be stepping on that high. I am a 68 year old female so it might be okay just for looks or for someone younger.
4,Bed steps for a high bed,These steps were easy to assemble and just right for climbing up into our recently purchased high mattress and box springs bed. We have hardwood floors in our bedroom and I had to glue small pieces of rubberized anti-skid material normally used under rugs onto the bottoms of the feet on the steps so as to keep the steps from sliding when my wife climbed into bed.
4,B.E.,"Very nice looking,yet do not know how sturdy. It sqeeks while stepping up on it. I would recommend it because of the price and it looks very nice."
3,powell bed sidesteps,Steps are as presented but not was well constructed as I had expected. Don't seem to be true solid wood. One piece partically split during the assembly process and some of the screw type pieces seem too short.
5,The Squares were the best,"The music is as good today as it was in the 80's. In Seattle, I first heard them on KBCS and immediately purchased their first album and soon after, this album. ""Neal Cassady"" is especially poignant. Bruce Paskow moved to Seattle in the early 90's and I was lucky to not only meet him, but also played music with him. What a treat. When he died, it was too sudden and too early for such a gentle and brilliant man. Buy this album and buy it now. You will not be sorry."
1,radiology,Very hard book to understand it had a lot going on in each chapter most of which is irrelevant to what you need to know. I won't purchase this unless you have some radiology already behind you
3,Dunk in a fjord.,"SLAY RIDE follows the normal Francis formula, but the life threatening assault on the hero, David Cleveland opens the story. This doesn't leave much time to develop the suspense that characterizes most Dick Francis novels. It was too easy to figure out ""who-done-it"", which spoils the fun, for the reader, of a mystery.The betrayal by a friend is sad, but plodding like a hard run race that didn't make it. But by all means read SLAY RIDE for the interest of knowing an author who stands head above the rest at a low point, it gives you insight into his power of storytelling.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,Good story and good characters,"I listened to this book on tape, and initially I had to accustom myself to the Norwegian setting and accents. Once I had myself acclimated, I enjoyed it a great deal, although I will say that I ""figured it out"" faster than I do some mysteries.What I liked, I think, was the slightly unique setting and the things about Northern European horse racing that I had not know before. I also thought the chracters were interesting and had some depth that is sometimes missing in Francis' books. There are some characters in this one that I have wondered about as you would with real people--what made them turn out this way? and what is going to happen to them afterwords?"
3,Left Me Cold,"Fortunately this wasn't my first Dick Francis novel so I knew better than to become discouraged by the substandard plot. Francis' characters are usually more likable than in this story. Even if the formula is a little predictable, following along is always enjoyable because the people involved are fun to watch. Friends betraying each other is a fortunately unpleasant rarity for Francis. The mystery also lacked the suspense and complexity of his other novels. Lastly, the setting, Norway, bored me as a back drop for this offering. Slay Ride is the only Dick Francis novel that, for me, has failed to please."
5,Northern Lights on the Track,"Dick Francis's main character is not a jockey in Slay Ride. The story takes place in Norway which is not really known for it's horse racing. I wondered if it would be a good read or just dropped in the basket for things that go to a second hand store. The story is so good it would make a fabulous movie. David Cleveland, the main character is a skillful investigator who is humble. The story is fun & has some history in it."
3,Enjoyable But Not Great,"I am not a great fan of Dick Francis. I've enjoyed every one of his books that I have read, but I do not go out of my way to look for his other books. After reading ""Slay-Ride"", I still feel the same way.David Cleveland, an investigator for British racing interests, goes to Norway to track down a missing British jockey suspected to stealing racetrack money. At the risk of revealing too much, let's just say things are not as they appear. The plot is satisfactory with probably more emphasis on action rather than detection.With just a couple of exceptions, I could not keep the Norwegian characters straight - I don't know whether this is my problem with their Norse names or it's Mr Francis's problem with not givng them more distinct personalities."
5,Utterly Awesome and EyeAwakening,This book is totally awesome and unbelieveable! My views have changed and I am growing spiritually and metaphysically thanks to the author.
5,This Book is Sensansional!,"There are alot of theories about the crucifixtion, but F. Dean Christensen takes a different approach that moreorless goes along with another book that has another theory about the crucifixition. I like Christensen's better and is more grounded to reality.It is unique and a lot of historical research shows that we should pay attention to the material that is condensed in a small book that is easy to read, sometimes hard to grasp and understand, but worth your time in realizing that there is indeed a myth around who Mary the mother of Jesus actually married.Rating this high, I leave you in suspension to make your own decision and rate this wonderful book!"
1,Crazy,"Within the first three pages many unsubstantiated erroneous claims are made. A piece of fiction true, but written is such an amateurishness way that one is immediately struck by the impression that the author is pushing thoughts brought on from too many pot sessions in the 60's.As for all the five star reviews...this surely must be a prime example of the weakness of the system. The author must have spent much time creating all of these accounts, or has a bunch of pot smoking hippy friends who also feel the vibrations from the mineral oars around them."
5,The entire Mideast Should Read This,Whatever one believes about historical research of the Star of Bethleham the 'Star Prophecy' outlined reached by Christensen dictates this should be distributed throughout the entire Midest!
3,good stuff from Ibiza,"Bruno Leprete continues the Cafe del Mar series with this 20th ann. compilation .although good, it doesn't reach the nirvana levels of Padilla's volumen 6 or Lepretes Cafe del Mar ChillHouse."
3,not impressed,"I have bought products of this brand before and I have never been disappointed.... However, this perfume is not good.... shortly lasting, incoherent accent..."
4,"guitars, girls, guns, gold.......","Author John Campo makes no bones about the fact that his protagonist Mr Bobby Turner is pretty much a version of his own tall hollow body jazz guitar playin' track bike racing self in his book ""Missing Tiger"". He takes you into the world of the professional musician. A guy on his first overseas gig, goes to Hong Kong, gets treated like an American Artist rather than a guy without a job, falls in love with a model, plays a few truly transcendental gigs, gets tied up with some seriously bad asian gangsters and lives to tell the tale. I read the book on a plane to a gig myself and I'll tell youits a real good ride.... kinda like a very fancy custom geometry track bike.....E. Ambel"
3,It was a good read.,"Bit too much angst and not as much fun as Joanna Trollope. Good read, worth it but not at the top of my list."
3,A reexamination of life's course,"Major life events, here the death of a dominating parent, often force us to reexamine the way we have led our lives. Lively creates two siblings who have never been true to themselves or even recognized what was true. When the mother who had through intimidation and criticism directed the lives of her children well into their maturity dies, the son and daughter are suddenly thrust in the role of directing their own lives. Before they can break out of living life by rote and habit, they must first truthfully face who they are after decades of directed patterns. This novel explores a universal theme and the major and minor characters she creates to make that life journey are at times engaging and at others frustrating. Worth a read and a thought."
5,A Heartbreaking & Deeply Moving Novel,"Reading this book broke my heart. And yet, when I finished it I turned back to page one and began again. The characters in this book are so complex and compelling, it was as if they were people who inhabit my day to day life. I recommend this book to anyone wishing to be haunted by perfect fiction."
3,Not the most lively Lively,"As a rule I like Penelope Lively's style and would happily read anything she writes. On this occasion I have to admit I took a break from the muddling pace of Helen and Edward's story about half-way through (while I quickly devoured Martin Amis's Lionel Asbo - talk about a change of tempo!) but I did finish it, and I am glad that I did. Ms Lively's novels are hardly plot-driven pot-boilers, but this one just seemed too ponderous at times, especially early on as we get to know the painfully insular, emotionally cauterised, middle-aged brother and sister and the ways in which their vile, overbearing mother impacted on their lives. The novel gathers pace toward the very end, as it draws some conclusions that left this reader somewhat unsatisfied. Not my favourite Lively, but still a solid three and a half star read from a classy, eloquent novelist."
5,Beach Boys Album,"Excellent album, with some of their older music, and a couple of later songs. I was a teenager during the time frame the Beach Boys were popular. My first experience with an mp3 product. So far, so good."
4,Good album for Beach Boys fans,"This is a pretty good mix of some of the better tunes done by the Beach Boys over the years, with several real clunkers thrown in the mix as well. Even with a many of the tunes being pretty lame lyrically, I still thoroughly enjoy just hearing those beautiful harmonies again. In fact, it is those wonderful harmonies that still let me overlook not only the lyrics, but even much of the rather awful guitar solos of that time. Having said that, I am still in awe of and never tire of pieces like Good Vibrations, Surfer Girl, Don't Worry Baby, In My Room, Don't Worry Baby, Good Timin', and Kokomo. These tunes let me overlook (and skip over) some of the truly awful tunes that are included on this disk (which I will leave to each listener to decide on). This is definitely a good album to own if you're a Beach Boys fan like myself."
5,Great To Exercise To!,"When looking for a Beach Boy CD, I wanted one that had the most songs and all the favorites. This fits the bill! I just love this CD. I exercise to it along with other CD's every day. I also grew up listening to the Beach Boys and they are one of my favorite groups. The songs remind me/and take me back to high school days. I would suggest that anyone who is a Beach Boy fan get this CD, you will be happy you did."
5,The Beach Boys Sounds Of Summer,All the best oldies!! Brings back some really good memories. Sounds great! I LOVE IT!!
5,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"This CD certainly brought me back to earlier days and truly fond memories of boyfriends past, dances long gone out of style and bikinis that now seem like full dress wear. I had a chance to get together with my college dorm mates and as we traveled by car through the Smoky Moutains we sang to this CD. Funny how we remembered the words, the hesitations and where we were when we heard ""Good Vibrations"" for the first time when we're now at a stage of life where memory isn't our best trait. This is what you want to listen to on a long drive or with a group of friends to sing along with you."
5,It IS the very best!,"If CDs could wear out, I'd be buying a new one by now. If you're a Beach Boys fan, you'll love this CD. If you're not, buy it and you will be."
4,"A Good Collection, Why Mono?","First came ""Beatles - 1"", then ""Elvis - 30 #1 Hits"", and now (my personal favorite) ""The Very Best of the Beach Boys - Sounds of Summer"". A single CD with 30 great tracks from one of the greatest bands of all time.I agree with the reviewer below who mentioned that there are many mono tracks on here that don't need to be in mono. There is a fine stereo remix of ""California Girls"" from 2002 and this song has never sounded better! But, if you don't care about stereo vs. mono, you'll love this CD!Besides the aforementioned details, this is a really nice CD. There are some great liner notes and pics inside, and the CD looks like the old yellow/orange swirl that used to be on Capitol 45s.Personally, I would have liked everything to be in stereo, but this CD is well worth it. From the bouncy ""Surfin' U.S.A."" to the lovely ""Surfer Girl"" to the group's last big one ""Kokomo"", this is a CD that should be in everyone's collection!"
4,left out !,"great cd, but how could they leave out.....little honda and catch a wave ? charles manson would be even madder at dennis wilson if he finds this out."
4,The Boys of Summer,"A good set with lots of great songs, but The Beach Boys have enough classics to easily fill two discs, a la FORTY LICKS. Among the missing: ""409"", ""Wendy"",""Catch A Wave"", ""Little Honda"",""The Little Girl I Once Knew"", ""Caroline No"", ""Cabinessence"", ""Surf's Up"", ""Sail On Sailor"", and something by Dennis and Carl - perhaps ""River Song"" and ""Feel Flows"", respectively.Still, if you don't have any Beach Boy albums, this is a good start. Then try the SUNFLOWER/SURF'S UP disc before it goes out of print."
4,Almost Complete,"Much like The Beatles' 1, you cannot quibble about the contents- all the songs presented here were top forty hits. However...this could have been truly definitive by including the two top forty entries that are not here- ""The Little Girl I Once Knew"" and ""It's OK"" (Yes, I'm aware ""Caroline, No"" also fits the bill, but technically speaking, that single was credited to Brian Wilson and not The Beach Boys). All thirty-two tracks could have been fitted onto one disc, as long as you include the mono single versions and not the stereo mixes of certain songs, which have been used here. Yes, this is the best single disc compilation out there, but my advice is to wait for the proposed double disc set ""40 Top 40s"" (including international chart hits), which will hopefully paint the complete picture."
5,The Summer of 63,"If you were a teenager in the Summer of '63 (or '64, '65, and '66) you were listening to the Beach Boys. Their songs were playing on car radios, on transistor radios at the beach, and on radios in your room. The ""hit"" radio versions were ""singles"" mixed in mono for maximum impact over the ""one speaker"" radios that most teens were listening to.Some, but not all, teens could afford to buy albums, and bought the ""stereo"" album mixes of those hits. But, the stereo mixes were NOT the hit versions we had heard (and burned into our memories) during weeks of radio re-playing.The strong point of this ""ultimate"" Beach Boys CD is that when two mixes are available, the ""hit"" version, often in mono, is the mix that is used. These are the REAL thing, just the way they sounded back in 1963.Thirty of the Beach Boys best songs...an audio ""time machine"" that can transport ""baby boomers"" back four decades in time...on a single CD at an attractive price. What more could a Beach Boy fan ask for?"
2,This is NOT the Best of The Beach Boys,"There are a lot of Good Songs Here, You already know that, everyone knows most of these Tunes, but any REAL Beach Boys Fan can see why this Set is Lacking...Mike Love is overrepresented here, from ""Rock and Roll Music"" to ""Kokomo"" (a Truly DREADFUL Song), sure those were Big Hits, but NOT Best; This Collection is a cynical Cash-Grabbing attempt to squeeze Money out of the most casual Beach Boys Fan, and the mastering is LOUD and Compressed...if You want a Great Beach Boys CD, try to Find ""Beach Boys Greatest"", a 25 Song Import from Japan (1998), that CD has more Brian Wilson Cuts, such as the Sublime ""Surf's Up"","" Sail on Sailor"", and ""Caroline No"" that are missing here."
4,hmmm,"ahhhh, what happened after track 16??? Kokomo instead of surf's up, till I die, please let me wonder? what about don't talk (put your head on my shoulder), kiss me, baby ? where are some of my favorites?... This hits collection is better for value than most other beach boys single-disc collections, but like most of them it picks the worst of the late-period beach boys stuff, when it could have chosen some really interesting later-period brian wilson tracks. your best bet is this: ask your friend who is a huge beach boys fan to make you 3 cds. 1. a pre-pet sounds best-of. 2. pet sounds 3. post-pet sounds (including smile tracks, tracks from surf's up, love you, smiley smile etc ...ok, if you really like kokomo stick that on there too..."
5,The very best of Beach boys,"Many of the best song from Beach boys, even if I missedthe song ""All summer long "" Lay back and listen to the songsOle"
4,wish had more 100% beach boys music,"Music is good, but I wish they put more strictly Beach Boys music on here instead of rehash's of 1950's songs that the Beach Boys had sung. Quality of the 1950's rehashes is pretty typical of what you'd expect the Beach Boys to do (probably not the best out there, but it's still decent). Seems to be missing some of their big hits as well (The Honda song and Catch a Wave). Perhaps those songs should have been put on there instead of the rehashes."
1,Incomplete Songs,"It's surprising to me that no one mentioned the key reason this is an unsatisfactory collection ... the songs are not complete. The songs only last 1:30 - 2:30 minutes ... very odd and very frustrating. I have no problem with the selections, but to have entire verses cut out makes me crazy."
3,Better off with a 2 CD set or DVD...,"This is okay, but is just an upgrade of ""Made in USA"". ""Good Vibrations"" is the motherlode, but ""Endless Summer"" is still the best collection. ""Very Best"" is misleading though. A few personal favorites left off of here...A 2 CD set would at least cover a lot more territory. Esp. if you like the stuff like ""Til I Die"", ""Forever"", and the other great songs from the late 60s-early 70s. And to me, when I heard Pet Sounds on DVD-Audio, hearing the ""singles"" isn't the same anymore.I do think that they should put out a video collection on DVD, there are more than enough documentaries explaining their story, it's always frustrating to see the footage spoiled by voiceovers (use the commentary track!). There's plenty of BB footage from TV and film, with and without beards. Maybe Brian, Mike, Al, and Bruce (and part time Beach Boy John Stamos) can work it out just long enough to put this one together."
5,Good vibrations.,"The phenomenal Beach Boys will forever be associated with the sounds of a California summer at the beach. You could play this in the middle of the night, in the pitchest of black, in a frozen northern arctic and still feel warmed by its strains. You might even think you're getting a little sun! This great retrospective includes 30 of their best. While I didn't mind (or notice) the mono versus stereo that another reviewer highlighted, this can be an important feature to some. But I didn't even notice it on headphones so...for what it's worth."
4,Want a cd with all the Beach Boy songs you know,"Beach Boys with songs you know, in a good order, enough said."
2,Dissapointing collection,The sound on this compilation is TERRIBLE. I would recommend buying PET SOUNDS and skip this..that's the only album you need.
3,Enough Already,"The Beach Boys are one of my favorite bands, but how many ""Best of"" and ""Greatest Hits"" compilations do the Beach Boys really need?"
5,The Beach Boys,"Great cd, every great song they ever did! 30 songs is a lot of songs for one cd.Sounded very clear."
5,The Beach Boys Are Cool.,"I don't think there is a single American child over the age of three that hasn't heard a Beach Boys song. They are still a significant part of our culture and a glimpse into the teen culture of our past (which isn't that different from today's). People loved them and still love them, that's why they are, perhaps, the greatest American band of all time. I don't think I can say that about many other artists, only R.E.M. and Talking Heads come to mind.The compilation contains thirty of their Top 40 hits and spans their entire career. If you're already a fan, you know all the songs and hold them dear to your heart. If you're a new fan, this is a great CD for you to begin your Beach Boys experience. There are a few splendid stereo mixes of songs that were only found in mono or poor stereo versions. ""Heroes and Villians"" is a major highlight, as well as ""Good Vibrations."""
4,Sounds of Summer,"As a greatest hits album this brings back a lot of memories from my youth. Many of the songs are fun to run to, also. The only song the Beach Boys should not have recorded was Chuck Berry's Rock and Roll Music. It does not fit the ""surf"" sound."
3,The Least You Could Do Is SMiLE,"This collection is nice but for a complete overview of the Beach Boys save up and get the GOOD VIBRATIONS: THIRTY YEARS OF THE BEACH BOYS box set.With the upcoming release of a rerecorded SMiLE album by Brian Wilson I'm hoping that Capitol Records will finally release a SMiLE box set with all the missing pieces left off the GOOD VIBRATIONS box set.Pieces missing are ""Barnyard,"" ""The Old Master Painter/You Are My Sunshine,"" ""Look (Song For Children),"" ""Child Is Father Of The Man,"" ""I'm In Great Shape,"" ""I Wanna Be Around/Friday Night (Woodshop)"", ""Holidays (On A Holiday),"" and ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (Fire)."" Also an unedited ""Surf's Up (Demo)"" and ""Heroes And Villains (Intro)"" please.So Capitol Records, cash in on this project please!"
3,Just OK,They could have picked songs from their later stuff that was better than what they put on this CD.
4,Six songs away from a 5-star...,"in my world, anyhoo...this is a really good collection, especially for the uninitiated, but... maaannn! These 6 addt'l. songs would of made this a true 'best of' classic:-""I DO LOVE YOU""-""TIL I DIE""-""SAIL ON SAILOR"" (why is this great song overlooked so often?)the last 3 SHOULD OF BEEN ON THIS COLLECTION:-""WENDY"" ?-""409"" ??-""CATCH A WAVE"" ?See what I mean? So close..."
5,Great Box Set,I love what they did with it!! Too bad they couldn't fit Screaming Masterpiece in there! It would have made a nice addition.
3,Not remastered on the CD Side!,"Yes, the DVD-remastered 5.1 mix sounds terrific, especially when paired with all the right equipment. However, Bjork did not give the stereo originals a sonic upgrade, and her 90s output certainly could've benefited from a digital remastering. If you already own all of Bjork's albums and do not need the 5.1 DVD-Audio, then give this pricey box-set a miss! Otherwise, head for the Greatest Hits, which feature all tracks digitally remastered!"
3,"Good, but it could be better","I've bought this pack because the description says that the albums are remastered in the cd side but is not true.I mean... yes, the disc has a side who can be played on a dvd and you can listen the songs in dolby digital 5.1 and it's great but the cd side could be remastered.If Bjork decides to release all her early albums (debut, post) remastered (in cd) i'll buy them but this pack is almost the same that the original cd's."
1,Great music ruined by the DualDisc format!!!!!,"5 stars for the music, but I bought this and it will not play on any of the 5 cd players I own! Dualdisc is a bad format. Do yourself a favor and make sure you can play these first. Wish I did!"
2,Why?,"I LOVE Björk. I own about 90% of the singles, all of her albums (on Vinyl, 5.1 DVD and SACD when available), a ton of her early stuff from the KUKL and sugracubes era and EVERY DVD she has released ever.So when I heard about this box, I just stopped and asked myself...'why?'Why put out $120+ for something I basically already have?One Little Indian should have just released the few albums that weren't already out in 5.1 (Debut, Post, Homogenic, etc.) instead of making this elaborate box.It's pretty, but it's overkill."
2,I agree with Mr Leonard - a Social Studies book,My son is a Junior in High School and brought this 5th Edition book home last week. I spent an hour going through this book and I have to tell you that I am disappointed in the content. It lacks historical information and focuses on Social issues. I want my son to know the historical information behind these social issues.It is sad that so much of our history is no longer being taught in our schools in favor of diversity.
2,History Book,I am know trying to sell the book because the professor I had was to fast so know I added another proffessor and he does not use any book but lecture notes only.I wish I could find a way to sell this book.
4,Looking for a CD to hear pronounciation of French words?,"I was looking for a CD with simple pronounciation of French vocabulary and I found it. I do not speak French, but my 5 year-old is learning French. I want to make sure that we are practicing the proper pronounciation. This CD has a woman who pronounces basic words in French, like numbers, body parts, etc. The words are said by themselves so that you can focus on their pronounciation."
2,"Hoping for a good book, got a lot less than expected.",I was expecting a novel that had something to tell. I was hoping Adrian and Paul would find a happy medium somewhere but they just seem to settle for what is in front of them.
3,Disappointing,"I thought the idea of reading a novel is for entertainment and to be taken away from the present. This was like reading a reality show whereby the reader is watching day to day occurrances.. then - the ending is 'to be continued'. Perhaps I missed some deeper meaning in this story. Perhaps the author is writing this story on an existencial level that I don't get! Perhaps it is meant to be studied in an English class to find deeper meanings! However, I very much liked the tender and poignant relationship between the 2 characters. That part of the story was touching. I hoped it would last for both of them. They both seemed so fragile and vulnerable. But what was 'the story'?? We are following 2 lovers as they seek change, and new beginnings. The story is easy to read and flows nicely but if it wasn't for the occasional sex romp I wouldn't believe I was reading the book I ordered. I am glad it wasn't any longer.Then it ends with a weather report."
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I am tired beyond belief of the pederast story: older guy, young boy/man. It's been done, it's been done, it's been done. But I stumbled on this novel totally by accident, was desperate for something to read, and was surprised. Remarkably surprised. It starts with a stray dog being killed and no one wanting to deal with the carcass and ends with the two main characters adopting another stray puppy. In between, House really sets up an interesting story of unwanted people (strays?) more desperate for love than they realize. He touches on AIDS, but doesn't dwell on it which was perfect for this story. The title hints at the subtle (Harris) and horrendous (Adrian) ways men abuse each other when all they really want is affection. Neither character is stock and House offers no easy answers or happy endings. Instead the end of the story has Harris and Adrian still en route with their new puppy, taking a breather on a shining, white salt flat.Good stuff!"
2,Bored,"This book was very boring to me. It took me a while to finish it, and every time I opened it I felt like I was doing a job I didn't like."
2,Like listening to your senile grandma babble,"Reading Munroe is like a visit to your senile old grandma in a depressing nursing home, listening to her babble about what it was like when she was young, yadda yadda yadda. Don't know what all the fuss is about - Munroe is overrated, although middle-aged women seem to enjoy her books."
1,This type of Scratchex no longer exists.,"After ordering the Scratchex shown in the add I was sent an alternative product. After finally getting in touch with the manufacturer, I learned they no longer made the type shown in the add. It would be appropriate to update their add"
4,Excellent and (mostly) accurate,"I've been an Eagles fan since 1970, and I still think the 1992 team had the most potential, possibly surpassing the 1979-80 Vermeil teams. This book gave me the inside scoop on that (disappointing) season, and also detailed the seeds that led to this team's collapse in the second half of the season, where they started 7-2 and finished 7-9.I rate it as ""mostly"" accurate because of little things like the Eagles playing the Phoenix Patriots. (I read the first edition, maybe that error was fixed in a later edition.)"
1,dell ink cartridge,"Sorry i really can't recommend this item. It's not the cartridge it's self, but it want work..The dell printer won't allow it to, and actually it messed my printer up, and i ended up buying a different one."
1,Don't waste yourn money,"This is my sweetheart's favorite candy. I ordered it for him for one of his many Valentine's Day presents. When he opened them up to indulge, they were all a melted gloppy mess."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,My 3 Year old laughed out loud at Lottie's antics. The brief text is accompanying by charming pictures that tell the rest of the story. This book is a great gift for any child who loves the beach.
3,Westcott Stainless Steel 12 in. Office Ruler with Non-Slip Cork Base,"This Westcott stainless steel ruler seemed to be made well, but the cork base on the back is cheap and has started to come off with minimal use. I especially noticed this when I tried to remove the made in China sticker from the back of the ruler. For now, the ruler will be good enough to use for work tasks."
4,As Expected,Product arrived in the condition and of a quality that I expected. I love the cork backing and stability of the stainless steel.
1,Rusty Rusty Rusty,After two days of use including two days in the dishwasher both of the two bowls I ordered RUSTED! Ug! Not worth the money at all. Going back to using my coffee mug saucers.
2,Rust,"I purchased 18 of these bowls to use for feeding my cats their daily soft food treat. They are a great size, and I like that they clean easily. However, after only one use, 4 of the 18 bowls developed rust along the top edge. I am not sure if they just aren't dishwasher safe or if those 4 were defective."
1,Not same as pictured,I had previously ordered the pictured product a year ago. I decided to order 4 extras. What I received is smaller than the original ones. Amazon is replacing 12 oz with 10 oz bowls!!! ripped off
3,They smell at first.,"I've ordered these bowls from Amazon three times. The first one I received had no outgassing odor, but both my subsequent orders of multiple bowls had rubber bottoms that smelled bad. Really bad. I ended up putting the bowls rubber side up on top of my kitchen cabinets for 4-6 weeks before I used them, so the smell faded before I used them for my cat. The smell *does* eventually fade, before it goes away completely with use and washings, but it can take a while.These bowls were much less expensive here on Amazon than I could find in pet stores nearby, and I had other bowls to use in the meantime, so it was fine for me to wait. But if you don't want to take the risk of getting smelly, outgassing bowls (e.g., you need to use them right away), I'd suggest buying them from a place that you can sniff them first."
1,Wrong Size,"I bought the 8 oz version awhile back. I know the size because I measured it and it holds 8 oz of water. It's a great bowl, but I needed a bigger one, so I ordered the 12 oz version. But the one I got is the same size as the 8 oz. Someone needs to get their act together."
3,"Not Stainless, so overpriced but practical","The PETCO stainless no-skid bowls do not appear to have any rust, unlike the Durapet ""stainless"" bowls which arrived with rust spots. We have several Durapet bowls and appreciate the sturdiness of the bowls, but the fact that they rust leaves us to wonder what contaminants may lurk in the ""stainless steel"". We offerWater XXX (Dark) - 16 oz. - Liquidto some of the pets so stainless steel water bowls are a must. We also feed a raw diet and have tile floors so quiet, sanitary food bowls are must. One thing that is quite annoying is that the Durapet bowls are often listed without dimensions so you don't really know what you are ordering until it arrives. We were disappointed that the large dishes were very shallow and wide making it impossible to fit them where we had our other bowls of the same volume. If you need them to fit in a particular area, request the dimensions prior to ordering."
2,smells bad,"I thought I had found a great product. What I didn't think of when purchasing it was even though it will not skid, the rubber on the bottom has an oder and one of my cats is completely turned off from eating her food because of it. I watched her eat and suddenly stop and start sniffing all around the bottom of it and then back away in disgust. I picked the bowl up and smelled it myself and it does stink. I've soaked it in soapy water but I don't know if will go away. I may just have to return them."
5,Do reviewers even read the books?,"The Evolution of Man Scientifically Disproved by William A. Williams was copyrighted in 1925, but it has much worthy material that is still valid. One sentence that stood out for me was the following: ""We are not surprised that Nietzsche, whose insane philosophy that might is right helped to bring on the world war, died in an insane asylum"" (p. 26). It has been well documented that WW2 Nazism was fueled by another godless system (Darwinianism), but this author, prior to WW2, was saying that another godless system contributed to the earlier war, WW1.One reviewer wrote, ""I would bet my last dollar that Williams had not read one word of Darwin's work...,"" but I wonder if the reviewer read Williams' book, as on page 5, Williams quoted substantially from Darwin's book."""
3,The Evolution of Man Scientificaly Disproved in 50 Arguments,"The writer makes a valid point. However, he never discusses the posibility that the Church has been historically corupt in the fact that anything that goes against their teachings is either destroyed or hidden from public view. Also, he does not consider the idea that life may have evolved on another planet and was transported to this planet by a higher evolved life form. ."
4,"Awesome, but hard to follow","This is a very good movie, but it is very hard to follow. If you like movies that mess with your mind then I suggest this movie. Ellen Page is phenomenal as always and she shows her talent. I strongly suggest atleast renting this movie."
1,Pretentious garbage!,"This was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life! I actually purchased this junk in a dollar store, and let me tell you, a dollar was too much! Visually headache-inducing, with some of the most irritating, unsympathetic characters ever committed to film. Please trust me and avoid this stinkbomb!"
3,Great Service From Amazon But This Film Bores Me,"I am a huge fan of Ellen page, she is, in my opinion, one of the best actresses of our day. I saw her in Juno then in Hard Candy and fell in love with how she conveys the emotions of all her interesting characters that she portrays. I was looking forward to this for I really enjoy artistic cinema but I must say this film left me bored and underwhelmed. I really didn't like the format of this film and barely anything happened. It was only an hour and ten minutes but it felt like a three hour film. It wasn't interesting and I really was just waiting for something to happen that never came. Ellen was good as usual but the rest of the film wasn't there."
2,Takes Grand Attention to Watch,"As a whole it delivers the message in the end but the way the film was put together makes it very hard to follow, confusing, frustrating. I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie, I was disappointed by it."
1,Bad movie layout!,"This might have been a good movie. I don't know why the directer decided to split the movie into devided boxes throughout the whole movie, that ruined the whole movie. I was very disappointed and would not reccomend this movie!!"
2,(?),Take away the extraneous/repeated shots the picture in a picture in a picture in a picture shots the long rambling along shots the stuff that makes no sense and you would end up with a movie of about twenty(20) minutes that almost makes sense.
2,It could have been a good movie,"If the director has not used the dreadfull split screens this could be a very good movie. Ellen Page is extremely good, pity that you must force yourself to go to the end as the split screens make it almost mandatory to stop and throw it away. I disliked the lack of continuity but that is a minor problem compared to the multiple little screens."
2,Exploration of guilt,"Ellen Page gives another wonderful performance in a film about 15 year old girl Tracey, growing up in a family with less than caring parents and an austistic younger brother. Her story is fragmented, disjointed and incoherent and movie's direction seems to follow that state of mind. Is Tracey mentally sick, or is something else going on with her young life that is causing her to run away from home and risk her young life to poverty, sexual abuse and street life?It is almost at the end of this film that we learn the full reason for her angst. Guilt is overwhelming her young life and she has no one to open to and relieve that pain. The circumstances of her brother's disappearance (and most likely death) are difficult to accept even for adult let alone fro a young sensitive woman who is taunted at her high school as she is neglected at home."
5,Ellen Page at her finest,"This is one of Ellen Page's best performances. If you loved her in any movie, then you should definitely see this one! The truth she brings to the struggle of her character, along with the innovative techniques used to tell the story, make for a performance that leaves you speechless. This movie is like nothing you have seen before."
2,Two Stars Just For Ellen Page,"I would give this movie 5 stars because of Ellen Page. I agree with a lot of the reviews that she is a very talented actor, however, this movie was simply annoying. If I were watching this in a movie theater I would have honestly walked out . . . very unhappy."
4,Good serie,"Overall good book and serie, although it got very manichean especially toward the end of the third book. Good purchase"
4,The best songs are....................,- 2 way- Differences- How deep is your love- Thats how i get down- Show after the show- Just because
3,Ginuwine falls off,"The Life can't top his first 2 discs. Differences is a great cut, but with Timbaland strangely missing from the mix, this one just didn't cut it. If you want Ginuwine, this isn't the one to buy."
3,It's aiiight....,"Actually I would give this album 3 1/2 stars if that matters. G really (...) me off when I found out Timbaland was only on one track. Yeah yeah, he wants to work with other producers but geez...ONE track. Is it kinda silly to leave a producer with a gag of platinum albums? Hey, I guess. Maybe I just like Tim that much though. I know I'm not alone. But once I listened to it a couple of times, I thought it was kinda decent. My favorite tracks are ""There it is"", ""So Fine"", ""That's how I get Down"", ""2 Way"", and ""Role Play"". I have his other two albums and I think both of them are better than this album. But to tell you the truth, if I didn't have this album, I would think about getting it all over again. All I gotta say is if he pulls this stunt again without having Tim on da beats, that might be one of G's albums I wont have."
5,The Best Yet!!,Number three of G's albums. And this one is the best yet. All the tracks on this CD are wonderful. And him being so FINE makes him sound even better than he already does. I'm G's Number 1 fan. SO you all can count on my review.
2,I SPENT MONEY ON THIS????,"So I liked Ginuwine first and second album.So when the life came out I figured why not? No. This is garbage.I'm not one to hate on a artist, Ginuwine has put out very good material in the past I just don't know what happend. I don't have time to follow who's who on a album I simply like good music, I dont care who does your beats.But sorry ginuwine your good looks only got you so far on this one.I will say that Tribute to a woman is a nice song, but everyone has one of those I-know-time-get-tough-but-keep-your-head-up kinda songs.Diffrences has a nice flow to it,but besides those two songs I don't know what he was thinking.Hit me on a two way???????????? and there's a whole song about this??? Okay I'm turning into a hater so that all I can say.But thats just my thoughts."
5,Still hot in 2012,I just pulled my old CD collection. What a classic. Hands down perfect album. This is such a classic man's CD... great for the car. Great to just vibe with.
3,THE CD IS OKAY NOT BAD,I liked 4 songs from this album. I think his best album was 100% Ginuwine. All of the songs on 100% Ginuwine is good.
2,Not a very good CD,"I like Ginuwine and his music but after hearing this CD I was disappointed. I only liked 4 songs; Why Not Me, Two Way. Differences and Superhuman are really nice. I was just not feelin most of the songs on this album, they were kind of boring. I expected a lot better from this CD. Overall I don't recommend this CD because most of the songs did not capture my attention."
4,this life is his,"All I have to say is job well done G, yes he's still that same ole G, but he definitely came with something different on the album. A lot of folks were hating b/c Timbaland's stop/stutter/jacked up beats are not all up over this CD. If that's what your looking for, look else where, G comes with something more realistic. He's a changed man for whatever reason and has more ballads on this one, many of course dedicated to his wife Sole. He slows things down, but he still has a couple of hot dance tracks on this CD as well. Ok, yes, he's not the best singer, but he does his best and continues to hold it down. This CD is a lot different from his first two, so be prepared for The Life."
5,"You must buy ""The Life""!","I think that this is the best Ginuwine album yet, I have all three, but you must recognize the fact that you grow artisically on each CD. So what if Timbaland is not on the whole CD; that's just the point, as an artist you are supposed to break from the norm, hence creativity.Anyway, from the first song ""Why Not Me""? on to the last song ""Just Because"", I have enjoyed every cut. I especially love ""Tribute To A Woman"". Ginuwine is definitely an entertainer who enjoys his craft."
1,What Was This??,It seems like Ginuwine just threw this album together. This is not what I was used to hearing from him. I was used to seeing Ginuwine as a slow ballad kind of person. I only found three songs that I liked on The Life.
2,the end,"lets face it, this cd could have been alot better, and what is the solution-Timbaland. this cd has decent songs but definitely misses Timbalands flavor he brought to the table, which made Ginuwines music stick out from any other r&b singer. not worth the money, cause Ginuwine never had the greatest voice, but he had Timbo's beats and influence, sorry to say it but ginuwine fell off."
1,THIS LIFE IS TRAGIC!!!,"Ginuwine has always been a favorite performer of mine. Even though he gives the false pretense of being an old schooler Ginuwine showed his true colors with this disc. The cd is for mass market consumption and its at its worst. The cd doesn't offer the vocal range I have come accustomed to with G and for some strange reason he chose to only work with Timbaland on one track. IF something isnt broke don't try to fix it should be applied here. The cd just sounds cluttered and it even has a Diane Warren track on it! There isn't the littlest smidgen of the raw energy and sexual nuances we have grown accustomed to. For shame Ginuwine i suggest you get on your ""Pony"" and ride to Timbaland's house for solid material."
3,I Don't Know,"I haven't listened to this cd entirely. But I think most everyone is missing the boat by not commenting on ""Just Because."" I can't imagine the whole cd is like this song, but if in fact it is, BUY IT FAST. ""Just Because"" is HOTT. It smokes at least as good as anything out there right now. Sexy, Driving, and Soulful, it's one song that definitely won't disappoint.Unfortunately, I'm unable to comment on whether the rest of the cd is worth buying (""Differences"" is kinda nice).Good Luck."
1,Poor,"Very poor. Timberland only did one track. I can tell, Ginuwine did the whole album by himself. Fans of ginuwine(mostly girls) save your money on the bull..."
2,ooops! He messed up!,"Anyone who thinks ""The Life"" is a good album has got to be trippin'. Beware, if you are a fan of Ginuwine's previous albums, please save your money because you will be in for a horrible shock with this one. It's clear now that his talent truly does not exist. He owes all his fame to Timbaland, the true genius. Trust me! The album only has 2 good songs."
2,He Messed UP,"I am a big fan of Ginuwine, and I own both of his previous CDs. I have to say that he messed up his entire flow with his new CD The Life. If you are looking to buy this CD, because you are a fan of his previous work I'm telling you to save your money, because this CD doesn't compare to his previous work. As fine as he is, and he is that fine, he couldn't make the horrible songs on this CD work."
5,GINUWINE IS BACK!!,"I am feelin' this album like none other! He puts it down for real. I love the song ""Differences"" because it's just one of those songs. I have the CD, and there is not a day that goes by that I don't listen to numbers 2,3,4,8,and 9! And plus, G is SO FINE! Much love goes out to him and I hope that he has much success with this CD."
3,"Not my favorite movie, but has some redeeming qualities.",This film features a young Tom Hanks. The most interesting bit for me is that he randomly wore one red shoe during part of it. There are some funny bits and the ending is good.
5,Great comedy,"This is one of the earlier Tom Hanks movies. While the plot is thin and silly, I laughed frequently during the movie. I love comedy, but only know of a few that really make me laugh."
5,Hysterical!!,"I first saw this movie right after it was released. I laughed so hard I was actually crying. Tom Hanks shines in his role, Jim Belushi, Carrie Fisher, Dabney Coleman, Lori Singer, et. al. make this movie a keeper. I lost my original copy in a move and have missed it since. I would recommend, and have recommended, ""The Man With One Red Shoe"" on many occasions."
3,Lighthearted spoof,"I have fond memories of this movie from my late adolescence. True, it is hard to keep track of which thugs work for which side, but in the end, who cares? The trouble Tom Hanks gets them into by innocently going about his own business is great! Jim Belushi has some great moments too, later on in the film. I laughed out loud for several gags, and can watch the movie more than once."
3,It has its moments,"Overall a nice movie ... but, not great. The story line is a bit confusing. You'll need to see the beginning 15 minutes several a couple times and read the jacket before knowing who's who and what it's all about. Belushi and Hanks both have some wonderful moments that make the film worth seeing and owning."
3,Entertaining,"A cleverly written spy thriller spoof and comedy with lots of good talent. It is worth watching and entertaining, but far from a great film. Hanks plays all his characters in a believable fashion and I have yet watched a film that he is in with regret. A mild recommendation."
3,Not For the Anally Retentive,"Tom Hanks made this in his late teen or early 20s.The running gag is the CIA mistakenly think Tom is a spy, and misinterpret everything he does as of momentous import.This is a baffling comedy with corpses appearing and disappearing without any explanation. The motives of the large cast of characters are a mystery. This is not a movie for the anally retentive who want all the lose ends tied up. Most of the time you are just as confused as Tom as to what the heck is going on.That said, it is a fun romp."
3,Very Funny early Tom Hanks movie (before he sold out to Hollywood)!,"Dir.: Stan Dragoti (or as some might callhim, Mr. Cheryl Tiegs)...Starring: TomHanks, Lori Singer, Dabney Coleman, JimMetzman...[he played 'Oi-ving', the doorman in Crocodile Dundee I]. A fine remakeof the 1970 French comedy, 'The Tall BlondeMan with one shoe.' Hnaks plays slighty flakyclassical musician who gets mistaken for agentwhich invovles all sorts of chases lead byhyper ambitious Dabney Coleman in one of hisbest roles of the '80's! Singer and Hanks arevery good in here. If Tom Hanks had stayed withcomedy, he would have been maybe the best. Sigh..."
5,It'll Work,"Rolled up 150-foot cord with no problem. I kind of wish it was a little heavier at the base because when you unwind it, it tends to tip over. But I can live with it. It does what it needs to do."
2,Need three hands,"I bought a 100 foot outside extension cord to power yard equipment, and stored it on this Bayco Reel. It's a heavy cord, rated for 15 amps.The reel is lightweight, and hard to handle when winding up the cable. I need to guide the cable with one hand, and I haven't figured out how to stablize the reel at the same time as I crank.This product is priced right, but needs a tweak on design so that long, heavy cables can be retrieved easily while using both hands for something else."
4,good,"it feels really light weight but it gets the job done. i put a 100 foot 12/3 cord on it and it fits, not a lot of room left for you hand to go under the handle but i have big hands so it might be different for other. all and all a good buy."
2,Think twice before buying...,This is a borderline toy. It may hold 150' of zip cord but that's about all. A more realistic max would be 75' of 12/3.
3,cord reel,"I like the idea of keeping my 150 ft. cord wrapped neatly, which this product does. I don't like that I have to completely unroll the cord to use it."
1,not a well thought out product,"there is no way to use only the length of the electrical cord needed - the whole cord must be unwound. This is also too small for 150 ft, unless you get a very thin cord - but for normal/heavy duty outdoor cords 75 ft is probably the practical max. Would not recomend this product."
2,Bayco 150 Foot Cord Reel,"Not the greatest reel. Rather flimsy. You have to un-reel the entire cord to reach the end plug. There is not a way to have it exposed and only partially un-reel the cord. The handle doesn't really do much except get in the way when pulling the cord. However it works well to store the cord, and that is where the handle comes in handy."
2,Flimsy,This thing is so flimsy. It flexes when winding and it feels like the handle will break on every revolution. I know this thing is cheap and true to form you get what you pay for. It will do the job with light duty or short cords but if you have any decent weight cord buy something else. Buy a hose reel.
1,Plastic Garbage,Not enough weight in stand to help coil a cord. Pieces fall off if you use it more than once. Waste of money.
5,Bayco K-100 150-Foot Cord Reel,"I probably have one of the first ones made. I didn't buy it from Amazon, I don't think Amazon was around when I bought it. I've had it so long it has turned yellow. I bought 2 and gave one to a Brother Inlaw. He still uses his, mine finally gave up the ghost this week. I just now ordered 2 more from Amazon, I hope they will be as good as these. I used it mostly with a Leaf Blower. I also use the double-wind method and since I need it portable I mounted it on a 1X8X24"" board and when rewinding the cord I stand on one end of the board this keeps the reel sturdy and easier to rewind. When using it I place the reel at the halfway point of the worksite this gives me room to maneuver without having to drag the reel."
3,Bayco K-100 150-Foot Cord Reel,This cannot handle 100 feet of 3/12 extension cord. I thought that since it could handle 150 feet it may be able to handle my thick 100 foot cord. It just barely fits and feels a little too flimsy for my liking. The price is right though.
4,Nice cord reel,"This reel does just what it is supposed to. It is more light duty than I had hoped, but it still works just fine and is holding up well."
1,150 cord reel,"Thisi a great product, just was meant for a flat cord not a round grounded cord. Electricians might find it useful."
1,Hate it,"If your buying this for organizational purposes to neatly store the cord in your garage, and never use it that's about all its good for.Don't buy this if you plan to use the cord. This was more of a nightmare to untangle than if I had just wound up the cord around my arm. Not worth the aggravation. I was ready to take a sledge hammer to it after 30 minutes of wasted time fighting to free the cord from it."
2,Flimsy,I would recommend something sturdier to hold as much power cord as one would roll into this unit.It is too light weight and doesn't reelin very well. You have to set it on a flat surface to use it such as a sturdy table making it inconvienent to use. I would recommend using a more expensive garden hose reel instead.
2,Too small!,Bought this for a new 100 foot cord and it barly holds it. Can't imagine if I had a 150 ft cord that it would fit.
2,Poor Design and Quality,"This item lives up to the saying, ""You get what you pay for"". The price was right so I bought it but the quality is definitely lacking. I suggest you spend a little more for quality because everytime I use it, it feels as if it is about to break."
5,Makes things soooo much easier,"The Bayco reel truly helps keep electrical cords neat and tidy, plus it's so easy to reel the cord up when it's time to put things away. The best part is that it is so efficient at keeping the cords free from kinks and you always know where your cord is at and that it will be in perfect working order. I highly recommend this item for all of your electrical cord needs."
3,Smaller than expected,Recommended with a 15 amp electric snow blower. Cord reel rated at 100 ft. Not if 12/3 wire. Expected reel to be larger.
2,Do not buy if you want to unroll your cable partially,The reel has no hole in the middle to pass extension cord through so you might unroll it partially.So you will need either unroll the cord completely and use the reel just as a storage or make the hole manually.That's what you have for the price.
1,Not Worth the work,I purchased this to us with a heavy duty 100 ft 12/3 cord. It is just too much cord for the spool. My bad on that I suppose. The product is not user friendly to wind and store cord. Chalk this one up to money wasted.
4,Works well enough,"I followed others' advice and wound my 100-ft cord from the middle (I'm not sure a longer cord would fit). I set the reel about half way from an outlet to where I need to work and pull out both ends at the same time. Makes it easy to plug in and get the work done. Not the most stable reel - it usually falls over as I pull out more cord but other than that, it works fine."
4,improvement,I FIND THIS ITEM A VERY HELPFUL ITEM FOR LONG ELECTRICAL CORDS.BUT-- I DRILLED A HOLE IN THE LARGE AREA OF THE HOLLOW 'HUB'AND RAN THE CORD INTO THE HOLLOW AREA AND RE-INSTALLED THE (male) plug through it and just a lttle 'sticking out' a short line attached to it can now reach the supply 'outlet' and when re-winding unplug this short piece and the winding goes very well .
3,Cheap,"The cheap price is reflected in the cheap quality. The plastic is pretty flimsy. I bought one of these cheaper at the l0cal store that is thicker plastic,cost less, is easier to operate, and is bigger. It didn't have the stand though. So I'm a little disappointed in this item. They really need to use better plastic and raise the price a buck or two. My original review of one star was not accepted. So I give it two extra stars so it'll pass the auto-screening system that appears to now be forcing over-inflated reviews on this site. I got this to hold a 100' 12/3 cable. Due to the size, if I can manage to fit it on there, it's going to be bulging out at the bottom of the stand, which will be useless at that point. If you're using this for a 100' smaller gauge cable, it's probably passable."
3,Decent,"Ordered this in a rush but then found it cheaper at Home Depot. Despite that, it works fine and keeps cords nice and neat. See other reviews for tips on how to wind the cord for best use."
2,"For the price, it's ok. But there are better else where.","Fortunately, I read the reviews before purchasing this item. And yet, I foolishly was a man and ignored the suggestions and tried to do it 'my way'. I highly recommend against this.The cord reel works if you use a twisty tie and tie the middle of your extension cord to the base as others have stated. It's not the most ideal solution but it works. I knock it down to two stars because even if you follow this method, sometimes the cord still gets tangled."
3,Cord gauge matters,The quality is fine but it didn't specify that the 150 feet of cord it's referring to is 16 gauge. I have 100 feet of 12 gauge that doesn't fit.
1,Cord Reel,No instructions came with it showing one how to wrap the cord around it w/out a messy tangle on each end of the cord
3,Good idea,It's still a little awkward to use. You virtually have to stand on each end of the base to hold it down while reeling the cord up. One reviewer suggested starting at the middle of a long extension cord and reeling up both halves at once. I must admit it worked pretty well and cut the time in half.
3,good reel for the price,"you get what you pay for. this is the best you can get for its price. the reel is pretty light and will not stay upright if you tug on the cord as you are using it. i have just been using this reel to *store* my electric lawnmower cord, and it works well for that purpose."
4,Inexpensive but effective solution to tangled cords,"The Bayco reel is lightweight, almost to point of being flimsy, but it works well. I followed one reviewer's advice and folded the cord in half and looping the midpoint under the hook, so that both ends of the cord are accessible. This makes it possible to spool out only as much cord as I need."
5,You get what you pay for,"This reel is good considering how much it costs. It can't hold more than 100 feet, in most cases. I only use it for storage, not for having a cord plugged in and half wound up at the same time."
3,Featherweight but acceptable,"No big guns here, but a perfect, inexpensive way to store Christmas lights (the reel snaps out), extension cords, etc. Handle gingerly, and it'll do a fair job."
2,Poorly assembled,"I wanted a cheap cord reel for my leaf blower. That is what I bought.It appears mine was assembled with two sides that lacked notched spines. Therefore, the one I received lacked any notches in the spines to retain the end of the cord that would otherwise be buried at the center of the reel. Without the notches to retain the cord end, it is VERY difficult to reel up the cord. To make mine useable, I bored a hole in the axle hub and ran one end of the cord out through the center of the hub. That way, I can connect either end without first emptying the spool.Should you decide to purchase this item, look at the image on the product label. It is a VERY badly Photoshoped image of the reel in use with its handle inverted over the reel held in the left hand of the user while the right hand is off to the side in a grasping position but not grasping the handle as it should have been."
3,Bayco K-100 cord real,"I use this for coiling a 100' 12ga extension cord and it just fits. However, the bad thing is that it is not easy because you have to hold it on the ground by stepping on one side to hold it down. Other bad thing is the it is held together rather flimsy because of one of them that I use, the thin plastic holding the two halfs together snapped off at one of the bottom connections and I will now have to get a bolt that is about 7 inches long to hold the this holder together.Still easier to use than having to coil the extension cord because it doesn't get twisted as when doing it by hand."
5,Works fine,This product works just fine for a person that does not use a cord for he often if you use it a lot like in a construction site it's too light weight but for a homeowner it works just fine thank you
2,Crappy,The edges all around are not very smooth...which cuts my hands & I worry about my cords. So I wrapped a lot of black tape 2 try 2 smooth some of the rough edges on it
4,Electrical Cord Reel,"I did not like this type of reel.For my use, I needed a extension cord reel which would allow meto have the male end facing out through the reel.So I could plug in into the outdoor outlet."
3,Not as sturdy as I thought,"I had hoped these were more sturdy, but I finally got one long cord wrapped around the ""wheel"". I have 3 more to do, but I'm not that happy with the effort it takes to get this done. I guess for the money, it's not bad, but I definitely would have gone a bit more money for something more substantial."
4,"Well, it works...","I wasn't expecting much, but the lack of thought for minding the cord when rolled up in order to plug it in is nonexistent... as is a way to keep the outside end secure once wound up. It does do the job, and is certainly cheap enough if tangled cords are a huge frustration to you as was to me."
1,Horrible,"Had bought this for wrapping my 100' extension cord. Total waste of money, time and effort. It keeps getting entangled in ti."
1,Junk,"Bought one at Home Depot. Notice you need to have the female end of the cord (the end you start wrapping with) sticking out so you can hook appliances into it. Well, notice there is no hole or place for the female end to stick out.. so in order to use the cord, you have to unwrap the entire cord each time. PITA. This is really a storage device for when you need to use the entire 150' cord."
2,You get what you pay for,"Very flimsy and cheap. There's no way to access both ends of the cord once you wind it up, so you must unroll the entire cord for each use. Sent it back."
1,USLESS EXCEPT FOR KITE STRING,"BOUGHT 3 OF THESEM USLESS, TO WEAK FOR DECENT SIZE EX-CORD, 100' 14 GUAGE, NO PLACE TO GET TO PLUG EMD WITHOUT TAKING ALL OFF OF THE REEL, WHEN YOU TRY TO PULL OFF CORED IT TIPS OVER, SAVE MONEY AND AGREVATION, BUY THE MORE EXPENSIVE AND WORTH IT ALEX STAMPING CORD REEL WOULD LIKE TO SEND THEM BACK OR DISCARD THEM."
1,worthless piece of plastic don't wast your money,i threw this in the garbage after two seconds of inspecting itdon't waste your money don't waste your money
1,The Single Worst Reccomendation of Amazon to Me,"When I searched for a leaf blower I wanted, it recommended this reel as the best way to keep track of the cord. It is totally worthless. Were it not for the trouble of returning it, I would get a refund. For me it goes directly into the Trash!"
1,Returned It,"For $10 I figured I would give this reel a try, well I got what I paid for and returned it. It isn't practical for my needs, I would have to unreel the whole cord to actually use it. The hook that you put the cord around to secure is very cheap and weak plastic and with my 12/3 cord it almost broke off the firs time I tried to hook the cord under it to start reeling it on.I find it much easier using a cable cuff than this reel and will stick with that for now."
2,Cord Reel,It will not hold 150 feet of heavier gage cord and you have to unwind the entire cord to use any part of it. I would not recommend it.
1,For storage only!,I thought this product would allow me to manage my cord while I worked with my snow thrower but it is for storage only. You have to unroll the entire cord to get to the plug for the electrical outlet.
2,Not very convenient,"This item is fine for storage of electrical cords, but is inconvenient to use. The stored cord must be reeled out to the length required prior to usage and prior to plugging in (unlike a hose reel, which reels out as needed). The price was very reasonable, though."
2,Cheap Plastic Wheel,This is very cheaply built plastic reel which is very weak and not worth the price and the product quality is poor at best.
2,Should have read the description more closely.,"If you just want to store a seldom used cable, this may work just fine, and the price is pretty low. However, if this is a cable you use frequently, it is a real pain-in-the-butt to always be forced to unwind this reel so you can plug one end into a receptacle, and the other into your device. Spend a bit more, get much better utility."
1,Not for outdoor extensions,The description is misleading because it doesn't say it will wind up 150 ONLY if you have 16 gauge or less. Who uses an outdoor extension cord which isn't at least 14 guage.....???? Don't buy unless you have less than 100 feet of extension cord...
3,Hose/cable Reel,I have looked at many reels for home use. I use a 100 feet of 12 gauge cable and have found nothing satisfactory (inexpensive for home use). I settled on a garden hose reel and it works fine and rolls around easily.. I use the double up method of winding. The garden hose reel may be someone`s answer for heavy cable as my 12 gauge.I rated a 3 merely on the description. I haven`t bought or used this model.Later. I finally settled on coiling by hand and putting it in a wheelbarrow. Solves all.
2,not what I expected,I have used this for a light weight cord( 16ga wire) and am a little disappointed in how it works. Maybe I expected too much.
4,Amazon best value item,"Use the center wind method mentioned in other reviews of this product to make it easier to wind and unwind. It is an inexpensive storage tool that works; what more can one ask? I would have rated it 5 stars if they had sealed the hub,handle and bottom rests at both ends."
4,Study and Functional,Sturdy plastic. Be sure the pigtail is no longer that 3 feet - it will bind up as you unwind it or wind it up. Heavy cords should be totally unwound to keep it from overheating. Good for hobbies and around the house.
3,A Bit Flimsy,"The quality of the materials is a bit flimsy. I got it for my 100' yellow jacket low gauge extension. It just barely fits (as I expected). If you have a smaller/higher gauge, this is probably good, but it's definitely just barely adequate for me. I'd pay for a tougher one next time."
1,No Way!,"The reel on this thing is less than 12"" in diameter. There is NO Way it will hold 150' of extension cord! I purchased it to hold the cord for my new snow blower, but I can't use it! It might hold 150' of speaker wire, but that's about it! I guess it's my own fault for not realizing that 16/3 cord is closer to the size of a regular indoor extension cord. Most outdoor cords are 12 or 14 gauge! I guess only electricians (who know what the sizes of cords really are) would have known that I was a fool for buying this for any real use! Hmmm...come to think of it, if anyone needs 150' of indoor extension cord, they might have bigger electrical issues than me!"
4,Best cord reel!,I bought this Bayco K-100 150-Foot Cord Reel for my Coleman 100 feet outdoor orange extension cord. The cord fits great on this reel and easy to handle. Great price too!
2,Save your money!!! ..Cheap plastic..,"I bought this after reading the amazon reviews but was hugely disappointed as soon as I took it out of the box . It looked cheap plastic.Like a cheap Chinese toy .only a matter of time before it breaks . As for the working , you can not use it as a rewinding reel as you move forward with your device on the one end.You have to unwind the cord first before power on and using your device . If you can wind up both side from middle , you will save some time ."
1,There are much better alternatives,"Either unwind the whole cord or nothing at all. The trick of folding the cord in half before winding leaves the reel midway from plug to you, and as you pull more cord, the reel is dragged along or the cord comes out of the plug. Spend a little more and get something you'll enjoy using, like the wall-mounted Grean Leaf (great product) or the well-built Quick Winder."
1,Sent it back,I sent it back because you need to unroll the entire length of cord in order to use it the way I planned. It is set up in such a way that you cannot plug it into electric while it is on the device.
1,Not a great product,"The reel is just too flimsy to be able to use on a consistent basis, or at all for me. I have to hold the reel down with one hand and reel the cord in with the other, and that still doesn't always hold it still. And obviously if you want to use an extension cord with this, you have to unreel the entire cord so that you can use each end. Useless reel in my opinion. I just wind up my extension cord with my arms and will end up throwing this out unfortunately...waste of money."
2,Not the best reel design,"While there are several 'tricks' for effectively using this reel, it just isn't as good a design as the steel frame 'S' designs that cost about $5 more. The 'S"" designs do not have the double sided frame of the Bayco that inhibits the 'male' end of the cord unless you modify the Bayco."
2,"Good for storage, not good for management","I had no issue winding up my brand new 100' 14 gauge cable onto this reel. However, this reel provides no way to actually use the cable while it's being reeled or unreeled. You either have to fold your cord in half, which unreels the other half as you pull on one end, or reel it up with one end in the center.Folding it in half might work if you're doing yard work, but when my driveway is covered in snow, there's no way I can put the cord half way down and just deal with it. So now I'm going to have to unreel the cord before I use it anyway. It's great that people have suggested modifications, but they still don't allow you to unwind the cord while it's plugged in - the cord would twist. Also, it only allows for about 5-10"" of lead wire, where all my garage outlets are about 3' off the floor. This works great for storing the cord when not in use, but provides absolutely no benefit for the cord while being used."
4,Makes Storing Long Extensions Easy,I like this unit. It is not quite as heavy duty as the Alert Stamping 7000WR unit but I used it to store two 50' extension cords plugged together in the middle. I used the suggested method of putting the middle of the extension cord at the center and rolled up the cords into 1 100' reel. Works well.
3,Useful,A little cumbersome to use but holds the extention cord well.It does get the extention cord off of my workbench.
1,You Have To Be Kidding- Terrible Design!,"I purchased this reel because it received good reviews. Unfortunately, it has been a big disappointment. The reel is designed so that it is necessary to unreel the entire cord in order to plug it in. The plug goes under a clip in the inside of the reel, and the cord then wraps around it. Hence, in order to access the plug, it is necessary to unwind the cord completely, free the plug from the clip, and then plug it in. The fact that the manufacturer would actually design it this way, boggles my mind. I look at this reel, shake my head, and think to myself, ""did the idiot who designed this thing actually try to use it?"" Don't buy this reel unless you are prepared to unwind the entire cord every time you want to use it."
2,Waste of time and money,Clumsy to handle and not efficient no matter how the cord is wound. Could have 'divider' to keep cord from tangling when wound up.
3,time will tell,Cheap but works; at that price what else would I expect. Time will tell if it holds up or not.
2,Lenghty and with open loops,"I was strongly tempted not to finish the book as the first half or more is extremely lengthy. The plot does creep forward with some very ""artificial"" twists to complicate the situation. Many long internal dialogues with repetitive and very infantile thoughts impact the flow of the whole story.At the end the male main character's background was left open and the whys of certain occcurrences were not clearly solved. It gave the book the impression of a hasty closure and the unsatisfactory feeling of open questions."
3,The Rose of Blacksword,"This book though predictable was compelling enough to keep me turning over the pages, some twists and turns were a nice touch and helped keep interestThe Rose of Blacksword (Loveswept).well worth the read"
2,Very poor writing in the most repetitive book I've read.....,"I gave this book my attention all the way to the end and finally, when it was finally over, all I wanted was my time back. The writing is sub par, poorly researched from a historical prospective. Worse than that though is the overwhelmingly repetitive story telling. The characters go through the same turmoil page after page, the love scenes are written almost in duplicate. They kissed, he touched her rear.... The book was not a page turner at all, except that I kept hoping it would end. There is no tension, poorly developed plot. Save yourself the money and even if you find this book free, save yourself the time."
5,twitches 9 a kids reveiw,"this book was really,really good. cam and alex are both making shady new friends.alex is hanging with michealina,a girl who's tried to hurt her in the past and cam is once again trying to convince herself that ex boyfriend shane isn't evil. both michealina and shane are working for thantos, the twins evil uncle. there's also some action with the other characters. Thantos asks miranda, the twins mother to marry him but she says no. the twins are getting really powerful in this one!"
5,The twins destiny...and the family curse,"Alex and Cam split up for the summer...for the first time since they have discovered each other. While Alex stays in Marble Bay, Cam goes to Coventry Island to help an old boyfriend of hers. Cam ends up in danger and Alex doesn't know it...yet. The twins in this book finds out a family secret and they are becoming really, really powerful."
3,Love is ageless,"The film demonstrates that love can happen at any age. It's the story of woman in her sixties and a man in his seventies who fall in love, though she is in a 30-year long marriage and has a daughter and grandchildrlen. As statistics have shown, older people are still capable of love in all of its aspects, including physical. The story line is thin but makes its point. The love scenes are graphic but tastefully shot; there's frontal nudity but nothing explicit. The film has a surprise ending."
2,More like 1 1/2 stars,I watched this because it was rated 4 stars. A woman in her sixties (I assume she's in her sixties) cheats on her husband of 30 years. Several scenes showing her having sex with her elderly lover and then with her elderly husband. She's having an affair because her marriage has gone south. End of story. I watched it nearly to the end trying to find out why it was rated so high. Never found the reason. Disappointed I wasted my time on this.
5,Fantastic Brazilian Photography!,"André Cypriano has been traveling to Ilha Grande since he was a teenager, adventuring with friends into forbidden areas looking for the best waves to surf. As the years progressed, he became attracted to the island's history and, as a documentary photographer, ended up being the only person authorized by the governor of Rio de Janeiro to spend days taking photographs inside the most infamous penitentiary in the history of Brazil, ""The Devil's Caldron."" Located inside a State Reserve, the prison was closed and the buildings demolished in 1994, eight months after Cypriano documented it.Amazing photography! Check out his other book on the favala's of Rio."
1,A waste of paper and print ...,"This appears to be a vague summation of numerous (good) books the author has read, about growing practices she's had little experience with. Little useful information, much misinformation. Appendix lists many good resources -- read them instead.Conceivably, someone who just moved to the mountainous southwest, and knows absolutely nothing about gardening in this challenging area, could find this little primer useful. But a far better use of their time would be spending a few hours with an actual gardener in their neighborhood."
5,Great info from the dieter's view,"The diet books themselves cover their own plans well, but this book really discusses the low carb way of eating from the dieter's point of view. I also liked being versed on what other low carb diets entail so I can make sure the plan I am choosing is for me. Great book!"
2,Nothing you cannot find yourself,"I bought this book after I read the raving reviews. Now, after I read it I don't see what is so special about this one. Just a summary of the low carb stuff she found on internet blogs. You are way better off with something more constructive and original. In my opinion any of the Fran McCullough books beat this one 10 to one. Hope this information will help my fellow low carb dieters."
3,Wish container was a little larger,"My husband has a 55 gallon for mollies and I have a 5 gallon for a Betta. He did not want to use the automatic feeder that I recently purchased and told me to buy the tetra vacation gel for the 55 gallon. I decided to set up the auto feeder for Betta and my husband dropped the Tetra Gel in the Molly tank. We left for 4 days and when we returned the water in the auto feeder was not cloudy, Betta alive and happy while the 55 gallon tank, the water was cloudy, the mollies did not look well and I found alot of the Tetra gel residue. I purchased my feeder else where cheaper, and can say it was worth the purchase. However, there are some cons I would like to point out.Cons:1) Cannot set a designated time;2) Container bit small for supposedly 1 months feeding; guess if you feed once a day it will last a month; and3) No clamp to support to fish tank only a couple of velcro strips"
1,No good.,"Got this feeder to use while I was on holidays for a couple of weeks, and returned to find two very dead fish. I'm guessing the food got wet, as the feeder was clogged. Must have happened really early on, and made a really disgusting mess."
1,Should be 0 Star,"Bought thsi feeder, followed instructions and it did not accept a proagram for 1,2 or 3 feedings a day. Tried 4 days in a row. Returned item and received a new one with THE SAME PROBLEM!! Now I'm not a genius but I am and engineer so I should know how to follow minor directions (granted most engineers don't follow them - initially). Piece of junk! Bought a cheap feeder at the local pet store that works."
1,"If You Care About Your Fish, Don't Buy This","I had the same problem as a previous reviewer. After setting it, the light blinked, as promised, every 5 seconds, but after several hours, it simply shut down. I tried new batteries and resetting to no avail. I returned it and got an Eheim 3581 for the same price that works like a charm. Don't waste your time or money on this clunker."
4,Chapter One,"I bought this CD after buying Chapter 2, and I am not disappointed. This I don't like it as much as Chapter 2, this CD does a great job showcasing Syleena's wonderful vocal talent. She is truly a talented lady and a gifted singer. She has a unique voice and style; no one can accuse her a being a cookie cutter r&b act. Syleena is one of the best in the genre, but yet is constantly overlooked. I advise everyone who likes real r&b and true soul, to get this album as well as Chapter 2. In order to keep great artists around, we have to support them."
3,FILLS IN THE BLANK SPACES IN MUSIC!!....3and 1/2,"This woman has an amazing voice.Her reaspy alto..she can sing to ma all day and i still wouldn't get tired of listening.This is an album which is average.Her voice is on point but some of the songs are mediocre.The songs..I Am Your Woman (first video i remember when i first saw her on Midnight Love..i though she could sang...influenced me to buy the album)Hit On Me (Second video i've seen.This is when i went to buy the album.The message and words are powerful and she sings it with such force.One of the best songs on this CD)Everybody Wants Something, He's Gonna Do You In, and You Said other good songs...average album but her voice makes up for it...OVERALL GRADE 79/100 = C+"
4,Not Bad At All. . .,"As a fan of pure new school r&b I wasn't expetcing too much here, the only reason that I got was because I was loving the first single and I couldn't find it anywhere. If you love smooth singing and interesting beats, then you'll probably do good by buying Syleena Johnson's record, she's got some pipes on her that could put you at ease in any situation. Besides I am Your Woman, my favorite tracks are You Said with Liberty City, He's Gonna Do You In, which is almost funny and You Ain't Right, one or two more ""happy"" songs would've done this record better, you'll feel like crying in the middle of it."
3,"Great Voice, Average Songs","While Sylenna Johnson offers us some much needed R&B today - in a world where it has the same textured beats and hardly any differences between artists - the album is fairly weak, but also quite good in some areas. She is more R&B in the soul sense, than say, most of the female R&B singers out today that are popular. The first single ""I Am Your Woman"" is a powerful ballad which shows the range she can acheive with her voice. Other highlights include ""You Said"", ""Hit On Me"", ""You Ain't Right"", and ""All Of Me"". However, many of the other songs are on the weaker side. I think with the right songs she could create a stellar album. Overall this is a nice start, and I can't wait to hear CHAPTER TWO of this book."
5,Very well-rounded artist!,Sylenna has a very powerful voice for her age. She is way ahead of her time. I truly appreciate Syleena's diversity and I pray that she gets more airplay because she is definatley underrated.
3,"SHE HAS STYLE ,GOTTA LISTEN TO THE WORDS","SHE HAS STYLE, AND SHE'S ONE TO KEEP A EYE ON.ITS A NICE ALBUM IF YOUR A MUSIC FAN AND ALL YOU KEEP HEARING IS THE SAME O SAME O. TRY THIS I LIKE IT AND I PLAY IT ALOT WHEN IM CHILLEN AND I NEED TIME TO THINK.IT WILL HIT THE SPOT."
2,Prof DRS Chicago Cutlery Metropolitan,Best buy by Consumer Reports but quality disappointing. After only a couple of months there's space between the blade and handle of a couple of the knives. Would not order again.
4,Chicago Cutlery Block Set Metropolatin,"Excellent razor sharp knife set. This set is not drop forged, but is very well made and holds a razor edge with just a little sharpening once in a while. I bought this set because it was highly recommended by Consumer Reports Magazine, and I was not dissapointed in its performance. I gave it four stars because it is not drop forged and the balance is not great, but I still highly recommended it."
4,Picture doesn't Match Product,"I've had a Chicago Cutlery set for 21 years, and it's been great. I've lost about three of the knives in that time, but the others still work fine. When I wanted to replace the set, though, this was the closest I could come to the Walnut set I had. I'm okay with the black, and the knives I received are quite sharp. But I was sent a 9-slot block for 8 knives, and the biggest disappointment is that there is no bread knife. So I am keeping my old set on the counter, something I'd wished to avoid. Also, the black knives are just not of the same quality as what I received for my wedding over two decades ago. Still, they are better than other knives I've tried, and if you don't mind unused slots in your block, this set is a good as any other."
2,Boring.,"One big early modern sex joke. Let's be honest, Shakespeare does it better. Save your money. Or buy ""The Revenger's Tragedy"" instead."
2,"They Should Re-Title This ""Blandera""","I just bought this cd and am so disappointed. Everything I love about Charlie Robison seems to have been toned down. Edgy and raw has become over-produced and commercialized. Most of the reviews I have read are using the phrase ""radio friendly"". Well, I think he has little chance of commercial success with this as he sounds bland and lifeless. I think there are only three songs on here worth listening to...Desperate Times (though this song certainly sounded better on his cd Bandera), the Preacher (on which he ALMOST sounds like his old self), and the Wedding Song (on which Natalie sounds better than Charlie but seems to have had her mic turned WAY down on the last chorus of the song). I guess this would be fine for someone who DIDN'T know how brilliant Charlie COULD be but it's too late for that with me."
1,Add Charlie Robison to the long list of Nashville sell-outs.,"Here we go again...a daring singer/songwriter gains local popularity...on his way to gaining widespread popularity...than splat, he goes and trades in his individuality for more radio time. If you want any kind of glimpse of his true talent, check out ""Life of the Party"".What's wrong Charlie, Texas radio not good enough for you???"
4,Robison Rocks!,"This guy is outstanding in his use of long and meaningful (i.e. well written) instrumentals in 'Desperate Times'. This song not only tells a pretty good story but it gets so pumped with power music jamns that it's hard to let go. 'I Want You Bad' is excellent but has no where near the length of jamns in 'Desperate Times'. Like I said, Robison Rocks!"
2,give it a try,"ok so it's not life of the party. and ok I saw charlie robison on cmt introducing joe diffie, and mark chestnut vidios (shudder) this is not that bad of an album it takes more so called chances than most nashville produced albums.and charle seems to have bigger fish to fry than being a honky tonk hero, so good luck charlie"
1,I would've given less than 1 star if I could.,"This is an awful album. Proving that talent doesn't necessarily run in the family, Charlie demonstrates on this disc that he isn't in the same league as a singer or songwriter as his brother, Bruce Robison.If Charlie hadn't married into the Dixie Chicks, he would still be mired in well-deserved obscurity, playing frat parties in Texas."
3,Don't believe thehype,"I pretty much wore out Charlie's last CD, ""Life of the Party,"" so I couldn't wait to get my hands on the new one. I have to say, I was disappointed. For all the talk about his renegade spirit, mostly what I heard on the new record was a former outlaw trying to make a record that radio stations would play. I was skeptical from the minute I saw the loads of self-indulgent, pretty boy pictures of Charlie on the liner notes. Don't get me wrong, the cd has some good songs - the duet with Natalie Maines and ""Anything Could Happen,"" being standouts - but the rest of the stuff is too jingly, too poppy - and at times, just flat corny. Charlie still writes well, but the soaring melodies and winsome nostalgia of ""My Hometown"" and gritty poetry of ""Loving Country"" are missing. Here's hoping he gets back to his roots on future releases."
4,"Great, but no ""Life of the Party""","I do like this cd, but, like many, I'm sure the expectations were high. If you are Charlie Robison fan, buy this cd. If you are a fan or ""My Hometown,"" ""Sunset Boulevard,"" and ""Lovin' County,"" then I would suggest getting the high points from a friend's copy. Through and through this is a great compilation of Texas country."
3,A little boring,"Heaven is about mArley, a fourteen year old girl living in a small town, who finds out a life changing secret. She discovers that she is adopted, that her mom is dead and her dad gave hear way when she was just a baby so he could tarvel. Marley has a lot of anger towards her adoptive parents and her real dad once she finds out, and also feels alone and unwanted. This book is about how Marley deals with this change and how she struggles to forgive her dad and adoptive family.I liked his book because it is a sweet story with a good moral, but it just wasn't very intresting. Anyone that is looking for a book that is intresting and where things happen in it, don't pick this book to read. It was well written with a nice ending but in a lot of parts I got really bored with it. I think people my age (teenagers) would think it drags on a lot and that it is really boring most of the time."
3,Heaven,"""Heaven"" is about Marley, a fourteen year old girl living in small town, who finds out a terrible secret. She discovers that she is adopted, that her real mom is dead and her dad couldn't keep her. This book is mostly about how Marley deals with this surprising news.I thought this book was well written and a sweet story with a good moral, but it wasn't very intresting. If you are looking for an intresting book where things happen in it then you would probaly hate this book. I thought it was ok but it got very boring in a lot of parts. It did have a sweet ending though and I thought the moral was good. I just dont think people my age (teenagers) would like it becuase nothing exciting really happens in it."
2,Heaven,It was a very compelling story of a young girl who finds out that there are many secrets in her life. I especially liked how it unraveled itself at the end.
4,Heaven !!!,I am member of SOUTHWOOD BOOK CLUB.This book was discuss in Nov. 2004This book was good and I will tell all of my friends to read this book.DENNIS A 'WILDCAT '!
3,Any 3 star book,This book goes into great details about the life of a girls whos world gets turned upside down. anyone whos ever had something importat kept from them and then came out and changed there life should read this book. Its thoughtful and makes you think. After you start reading it you wont want to put it down. ---Sasha
2,READ THIS! IT'S AN OK STORY.,"I gave that book only 2 stars because I wouldn't say I like it. I didn't. Do you ask why because there is actually no topic. I mean, there is but when you are expecting to read what's happenning you just can't. For example, in the book it says her uncle(real father) came to see her but it just stops here. It doesn't say what happenned next or what they said. So if you like books that have no points at all than you would like that book. by Sezen"
4,Heaven,Heaven is about a girl named Marley. Marley is a fourteen-year-old that lives in a small town called Heaven in Ohio. Marley had just found out that her parents are adoptive parents and not her biological parents. Her biological parent was Uncle Jack. I thought the book Heaven was very interesting. I thought it was interesting because they explained the details of everything. Angela Johnson made the events very believable.
4,Reality Writes!,"Marley is a fourteen year old girl who lives with her parents in Heaven, Ohio. The book discusses on an average day what she does. She sometimes go to the ma suprette to wire money to her uncle, she spends time with her friends Shoggy and Bobby (this character later comes in Johnson book called first part last). Marley narration through out the book let you realize her family is not a bad one. Her world comes tumbling down when she finds out that the people she has called mom and pops all her life are really her aunt and uncle and the uncle that she has been wiring money too is her real father. The book has many little chapters with different headings that focus on the specific title in each. It shows Marley emotions going up and down on the reality of her world and how she eventually deals with seeing her real dad coming to visit. A great read!"
4,"Difficult to get into, but really enjoyed the ending.","I had a really hard time getting into this book. At first I was confused as to how the characters were related. I also had a difficult time adjusting to the author's style. For some reason, I struggled with how she used the first person point of view. However, once I began getting into the plot, I could not put the book down. I am not adopted, but the author did an excellent job getting across to the reader how Marley felt when she discovered her parent's secret. As the reader, I went through the feelings that Marley went through. I felt myself getting angry for Marley and at Marley. I wanted her to get upset and confront her parents with their secret. I also was very upset with Jack that he only wrote letters, but never visited until he felt like he had to. I really enjoyed how the book ended. I loved the connection the author made with the first letter from Jack. In the end, this was a very enjoyable book and I highly recommend it to anyone."
3,Heaven by Angela Johnson,"Have you ever read a fiction book that made you wonder if it was really fiction? Have they ever seemed so real that it could be non-fiction? Well if you read Heaven by Angela Johnson than you will probably find out what I am talking about. This is a wonderful story of a young girl who discovers the truth after knowing so many lies. She had to learn that she can love her ""family"" even though she was not born into it and she can love her true father even though he left her with his brother when her real mother died. This book takes you on a journey of the pain some people go through and their triumphs."
3,Worth reading,"I read ""Heaven"" this summer, and though I read it all at once, I thought I would have enjoyed it more than I did. Marley, the main character, is well developed, but I felt the book was very predictable. About half-way through the novel, I knew just what would happen in the second half. I would say this book is worth reading, but only if another book isn't avalible."
5,Remarkable,"""What's remarkable to me, besides the awesome task of envisioning, designing, organizing, interviewing, drawing, questioning, thinking, typing, and finally publishing, was that even thought the spine of the book and the research topic is about homeschooling (and does not really effect my life one way or another), I couldn't put the book down. It's so HUMAN. So BROAD. So interesting because it's about PEOPLE. Their dreams. Their 'ideas.' Their Day. But, mostly, I was in awe of the strength, resourcefulness and sheer revolutionary energy needed to go one's own way."""
2,light of the western stars,I did not think much of it for being a good western book.not much to keep a person wanting to get back to book.
2,western,"Good: the novel is fun and you can enjoy if you really like the genere.Bad: outdated, not a great book, full of prejudice and racist.It is written like a kid's tale, only longer, will show superiority (?) of white race over and over, a white princess (Majesty) falls in love with a cowboy."
5,My wife enjoyed this book,"She loves her kindle reader and spends many hours reading books on it. So I rate all her kindle books highly, because I get a lot of peace and quiet while she reads them. Glad to let her use my amazon account to get her books :)"
1,Not what I thought I had ordered,"The petticoat arrived a day late for the party for which my granddaughter had ordered it. It was terribly scratchy and too long, so, even if it had arrived on time, she wouldn't have been able to wear it. I wish she hadn't opened it because now I can't find the paper work to return it."
4,Blast from the Past,"I purchase this item to wear under a 40's/50's style dress. It worked perfectly for my tea-length dress. The waist is a string-tie, so that was a bit of a surprise, but it allowed you to easily adjust it. It has a liner on the inside, so the crinoline doesn't scratch your legs. I like the black color, but I would purchase another one in a different color just for variety."
5,Poodle slip,The slip arrived as it was shown in the photos. The cost was on par with others I had seen online.
2,no sign of it yet!,We have yet to recieve this book... so I can not review it. Unfortunately I have no way of tracking it.
4,John Deere Tractor Data Book Extremely Helpful,"I used this book to complete my restoration of an old John Deere ""A"". By using this book I was able to accurately reproduce the stenciling to the original specs."
1,"really slow and boring, felt like watching grass grow","saw this series all the way up thru episode 28then i had to stop as i was totally boredproblem is with the script, lots of digressions unrelated to the main plotthe only redeeming quality is the costumethis 60 plus episode series could be presented much better in 20 episode max....major disappointment...."
4,Touching and magical,"This is a true American classic....to me it ranks right up there with 3 men and a baby, and Freaky FRiday ( the shelley Long version). mary-kate and ashley are both extremely talented and make you feel their emotions...they do not hold back at all in their performances....martin mull is amazing as Bart "" the fink ""...at times I almost felt bad for him.....the scene in the raft was exciting fun that kept me on the edge of mu seat.... This movie is great enough to get me to put down an Ann M. Martin book. I recommend it for any true cinema fan."
4,Not thier best,Mary Kate and Ashley have a lot better movies but it is great. The whole family enjoys it.Although after watching it about 10 times you should wait two weeks or so before watching it again.
5,"""A treat for your whole family,even if your 100 years old!""","The girls in this movie play Jessica and Susie and their dad who goes to the ranch that their mom had grown up on! On their way on the ranch they relieze that the ower Mra.Nana's son Brat is going to sell the ranch and and is going to make it a Theme Park,Meanwhile Nana fights over the deal of signing the contratct in which she sign's a fake one. This movie is packed with laughs and more! Doesn't matter if your 100 years old! It's for the whole family!"
4,fun !!!!!!!!!,this is a really great film why do people alaways slam them they work their butts off to make a great film !!!!!!!!!!lovebabyface
3,How the West Was Fun!,Very cute...similar to other olsen movies with a different setting! But still a great movie to watch!

2,Kokushi-ryu Jujitsu,"I found this book to be rehashed Aikido/Judo moves done in the older form appearing to look like the original jujitsu waza. But the arts are not necessarily the original jujitsu combat forms, particularly the ukemi.It appears that many high ranks in Judo and Aikido are trying to get back into the older arts of jujitsu to round out what may have been missing in their specialty training in current years, but are injecting too many of the modern sport moves in to their own homegrown systems to actually be combat authentic. Simply taking a jujitsu test in judo to become qualified in jujitsu does not seem to work out very well.The Gracies may just as well written the book, their background is similar to the Authors from the looks of it."
4,Looks good. Lowest speed is pretty fast.,"I like the looks of it. The lowest speed is faster than I'd like. It needed to be assembled, which I expected since I purchased it online. It wasn't hard to put together. The base is nice and sturdy."
5,Powerful music,"This album is awesome. If you like celtic folk rock, it gets no better than this. I especially like the cover of ""Sweet Thing"". And ""Bang on the ear"" is a jam. Not a weak track in the whole album. Buy it."
4,"Yes, great, but...","Is anyone else getting tired of reissues that monkey around with the format of the original release? Don't get me wrong, I love a second disc or even some bonus tracks thrown on at the end. But lengthening songs or adding new ones right in the middle of things (like the other Waterboys reissues have) just mucks with the whole remembered experience. I want ""World Party"" to sound just like it did when I first heard it twenty years ago, not with some improvised ""natural"" ending. You wouldn't add new paint to the Mona Lisa, and you shouldn't add new music to Fisherman's Blues! Throw the ""full length"" versions on the second disc, but leave the original LP alone. It is art, after all."
3,A mixed bag,"When the Waterboys stick to a more traditional sound, on songs like ""And a Bang On The Ear"" and ""Has Anybody Here Seen Hank?"" they create music that is a pleasure to listen to. But on songs like ""We Will not Be Lovers"" with its repetitive screeching violin and an ill-fated cover of Van Morrison's ""Sweet Thing"", the band's strengths are lost in amplified volume and annoying vocals. The qualities of the good songs outweigh the bad so this is not a mistake if you like the band, but beware; this is an example of why the ""next"" button on your CD player was invented."
4,Timeless music,Bought it for the girlfriend who is a fan but the reviews are true: timeless music; it does not sound outdated. If you like XM Cafe then you'll enjoy this album. I must say I've come to enjoy the Waterboys now too.
5,Very good grinder,"Bought this since it ships free, although it may cost less in other site, but shipping generally adds $15 to the final cost. It is a cast iron version with zinc coating. Washing is required since there is a lot of metal powder on the surface, used a pound of beef to make sure it is clean. It does a good job, 10 lbs of meat took less than 15 minutes. Cleaning is reasonable simple. we used to have an electric one, but the manual grinder is a lot better since it is easier to control the speed. If you only have a pound or so meat to grind, it is not worth the trouble. The home made ground pork and beef is so much leaner, you will never buy those from store again. Highly recommended"
1,"Rusty garbage, open boxed","I just received it, it is totally disappointed. It said it was new, but it is Open boxed, rust all over. Other than throw it into garabage can, I can't think of anything else. It is not worth to return it because of the two way postage."
5,I Paid More at Whole Foods-Great Product and Worth the Price!,"I am trying to detox my body and my skin and this is recommended along with the whole psyllium husks. I dring it in the morning before I eat and I can say that it is working! I have a lot of poop that comes out easily and although I have been utilizing the colonic therapy as well, there is still a lot that adheres to the intestinal walls that this regimen addresses. You may feel bloated as it absorbs and the pysillium absorbs 60x's its weight in fluid. Great product and tastes fine to me. No nasty. I actually look forward to my regimen. Try it, well worth even the increased amount I paid for it. At the Amazon price you cannot go wrong!"
5,Does its job well,"I took this product along with psyllium powder while juice fasting. This combination worked very well at removing waste from my digestive track. It works by absorbing gunk off the intestinal linging apparently, and then, by adhering to the psyllium or fiber from one's diet, being passed in one's bowel movement. The results are empirically certain for one can see and smell the stuff, and it certainly removed some grime that I'd rather not have stored up in my guts!"
4,Fans of Kit Watkin's Azure release will enjoy this title,"If you're familiar with Watkin's other works, this CD won't disapoint you. His masterful use of electronic percussion to punctuate dark and mysterious undercurrents of melody is as forceful as ever.Yet, as anyone also familiar with Watkin's brief stint with Camel (""Remote Romance"") knows, he can call up a funky, slightly jazzy bent on occasion, as witnessed by ""Funky Duty,"" an up-tempo detuned piano chordal blues number, complete with skat track.The only track I feel could have been tightened up is the 12-plus minute opus ""Cell Division."" An interesting concept without enough fresh content to last the entire length.""Cell Division"" notwithstanding, this is a great effort."
2,ok women in prison movie,"Typical wip movie but this time they are forced to work at a strip-club by the judge that put then in prison. so-so acting, strip-search, no shower scenes."
2,Early Detection,This book was very repetitive throughout but especially in the first 100 pages. While it is understandable that the early detection mantra is repeated throughout the 20th century the authors narrative seems to basically just reword sentences from earlier in the book in numerous places. There was also a few places where the author makes unsupported claims. Read the introduction and conclusions of the chapters and you will be able to get the main points of breast cancer awareness in the 20th century without reading the same things over and over again.
2,No Mountain Lion,"This was a great monitor with Lion but it simply refuses to work with Mountain Lion. I've tried installing the software 10 different ways including the newest versions and help from displaylink but it's a no go. Even 10.8.1 and the latest 10.8.2 beta does not work. Could work later down the road but if your a mac user and running Mountain Lion, stay away for now."
4,Great tool when you get the hang of it,"Got this from Think Geek months ago and thought it was causing problems for a while: it just doesn't seem to handle alt-tabbing at all. I am a gamer and I use it to keep track of my voip programs, email and itunes while I game, and it does a great job of that. I just had to learn to run my games in windowed mode on my big monitor, so that I can run my mouse cursor over to it if I need to, without alt-tabbing."
1,A Joke product by a Joke company,"I received one of these for Christmas after being asked ""what do you want"" for the 1oo'th time. When I first got it, I noticed that it is NOT what they showed in the picture, mine was extremely low quality,, no finish, no logo, the buttons on it are poor, the screen image is that of a SD TV, and the leg in the back doesn't seem to hold it up on it own and the device has to be propped against my monitor to stop it from slidding. The USB wire that connects it seems to have large issues, even the slightest tap will cause the screen to cut out and my main monitor will begin to flicker, sometimes just for about 10 seconds, other times, until I pick the device up , unplug it and plug it back in(can you say Recursion?), This usually ends with whatever game I was playing finally ether black screening, crashing or just hanging up."

3,Basic information,This book is a compliment to avalanche training and should not be the only form of training before going into the backcountry unless you are interested in putting yourself and your friends in a bad position in the mountains.
4,images that linger while you sleep,"I'm thrilled Ms. Kane sickened and disgusted the general populace, because someone certainly needs to. There's only so much more peace and love we can stand. Yet note how her latest work was revered instead of reviled. What a strange coincidence. As for Colorado, your holier-than-thou attitude toward Kane's ""perversions"" will, I hope, someday find you nailed to your own cross. How callous are you to hope her death will eradicate her work? Somewhere she's laughing at you. Can you hear her?"
2,Ugh.,"They tell me that Sarah Kane made quite a stir in British theatre before her untimely suicide in 1999. Given the undeniable intensity of ""Blasted,"" not to mention the in-your-face subject matter, it's not difficult to see why. I think Kane had at least some talent, but the modest technical skill she brings to this play is definitely overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the material. Really, ""Blasted"" is just that old Theatre of the Absurd shtick--you know: ""The world is a crazy, horrible place but it's all we have""--updated for somewhat more permissive 1990's audiences; no one familiar with the best plays of Beckett, Pinter, or Stoppard should be terribly impressed by it. The companion piece, ""Phaedra's Love,"" is more of the same, only lacking the questionable merits of the first play. In fact, ""Phaedra's Love"" is flat-out awful, strongly suggesting that Kane had really very little to say. But that's often how it goes with would-be rebels in the arts."
4,ESSENTIALS - Bread,"In my opinion, it is so far the best collection of Bread hits published till to date.Of course the price is more than reasonable considering that this compilation includes the very best four hits that made this group one of the prolific groups of the seventies with tracks like : If, Baby I'm A Want You, Lost Without Your Love and Make It With You."
4,Winding tale full of ethereal music,"This book's hard to classify--fantasy or science fiction, mainstream or young adult. It's the tale of two women and the music that binds them. In the 1700's, a young poor girl busks the street playing music from glasses. She's mentored by Benjamin Franklin, who wants her to play his own glass instrument. In 2018, musical virtuoso, Erin, returns to play that same instrument.The story is well-written, if a bit long. To me, the 1700's was a richer venue well depicted and compelling, while the future seems a bit barren and uncertain."
1,Disappointing,"Compared to her well-done trilogy, this book is like it's written by an different writer. The characters are poorly developed and one-dimensional. This makes it hard to really care about them. More interesting was the portion of the story set in the 1700's; Eilish was somewhat interesting. Erin seemed too weak and whiny of a character to be the other half of the book. Likewise, it's hard to feel any sympathy or care about Charlie and whether he walks again or not. He's just there.The plot is also thin--I kept thinking ""When is something going to happen?"" There's not enough foreshadowing of some of the events that occur towards the end in Erin's part, and a miraculous event near the end seems too convienently resolved.Finally, in the trilogy, Ms. Marley made us a part of the music and in undestanding how it works and affects other people. This one never quite reaches that height."
2,Disappointed,"I started this book with high expectation from the previous reviews, but I found the plot to weak and the characters to be very, very...thin...underdeveloped...two dimensional. The two parts of the book are disjointed and painfully parallel at the same time. The section that happens in the past is far more interesting than the part that occurs in the future. Reading the chapters that happen in 2018, I found myself all too ready to rid myself of the whiney characters and get back to the past."
5,Precise and to the point,"It's started on a slope of the hill... Three hackers, one from mainframe, another from Linux, and the third one from Java, decide to learn the new language from Microsoft... Their dialogs inserted across the book take a very small part of the text, but they add the humor and very nice personal touch, such as I did not see since Algol-68 specifications. And they also help to understand many things much better.What is probably the best thing, I like about this book, is that it does not just say what the language does, but why it does that and why it was designed this way. Frankly, I was puzzled by #region directive in C# before, and now it makes perfect sense.I also like, that this book is concentrated on the actual language, not on Microsoft tools and which key to press, when computer wants ""any"" key. This book respects the reader, assumes simple things, and explains complex ones. At least it worked this way for me."
2,Very Disappointing,"Far from getting a good book full of tips and tricks, the authors present little more knowledge than could be gleaned from a few sample source files. From general misstatements about other languages on, this book falls very flat. Look elsewhere."
5,a unique romanic drama,"I first came aware of this movie, 5x2, after seeing it on TV. I am puchasing a hard copy because I felt it was fairly intellegent, but entertaing take on marriage. While I generally do not like chick-flicks, this one is an exaption. Just one nitpick, I still don't know why in this day and age there is not a Spanish subtrack. As a learner of the laugue, that would come in handy for the Spanish speakers/learneres in this contry."
5,deeply moving,"(sorry about spelling mastakes.dylexic) you must buy this book, it is the best adult fiction book i have ever read,, it takes you thought all the amotions, fear, joy, ect i loved the ending to, bet you cant gess it, please please buy this book, you wont regret it, if you buy it and do not like it, i will send you a postcard size origanal painting by my self, (sorry i am not famous artist) as componsation, but i am sure i wont need to, as you will love the book, ella, this is the first book review i have ever writen, i do not do this book justace, as i cant find the words to describe it, just buy it and write your own review, cheers jane"
5,Movie,Love these two movies from the 80's. brought back memories of what we looked like and how great music was then.
4,How to Build Glued lapstrake Wooden Boats,InformativeGreat tips and jigsDefinitely a must read for this type of boat construction.Pictures are B&W; and could be bigger / clearer. The text is sufficiently descriptive so this is a minor point.
2,"Great illustrations, terrible verse","This book has wonderfully bold, creatively designed illustrations which makes it enjoyable to flip through. But the plodding text makes it impossible to read! Cumulative verse can be very fun and effective, but in this book the author made no attempt to create a lyrical ""chorus"" that kids would be able to chime in on when being read to, or even that adults would be able to read aloud pleasantly. The point of the interconnectedness of life in an ecosystem doesn't come across well in the story alone... only by reading the letter from the author at the beginning and the pages of notes at the end do you get the full picture of what the book is trying to say. I think the concept of the book was great, but it failed miserably in execution, thanks to the poorly written verse."
2,It's been done (and done and done),"It's particularly disappointing when editors touting themselves as experts can't be reliable sources for much more than safe picks. SF should be cutting edge. A little vision and originality would have saved it, and maybe 30 years ago it would've been less dull."
2,The Prehistory of the Northwest Coast,"This book was not helpful to me at all. Matson and Coupland left out many of the major archaeology sites from the Pacific Northwest. They wrote in a technical style which if you had little to no background information this book would not help you to understand. They also wrote insignifigant background information about the site(s) being discussed. Over all this book should be used for information on the archaeology of southern Vancouver B.C. For better information on Pacific Northwest Archaeology you should check out the book ""Peoples of the Northwest Coast: Their archaeology and Prehistory"" by Ames and Maschner"
2,"Alright, but there are better books","This is the only one of Ms. Morrison's books that I can actually recommend, but at the same time, there are much better books on herbalism such as Scott Cunningham's ""Magical Herbalism"" and ""Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs."""
2,Not Enough Information,"While this book may work as a primer for those who are new to herbs, there just is not enough information for someone to effectively use herbal formulas. And there is a serious lack of information on how to correctly use herbs. Blood cleaners such as Burdock, Sarsaparilla, Red Clover, and Sassafras need to be used wisely, which means making sure elimination channels are open properly before flooding the body with toxins and waste matter these herbs break lose in the body. There are glaring errors in this book which leads me to believe this author does not know herbs well at all. Cayenne does NOT cause severe kidney damage as the author states. The statement that the readers are not ""smart enough to use this remedy for too long without medical advice"" is ludicrous. Another drawback is the lack of an index to quickly locate herbs references."
1,"""Remember Me"" should have been left as a stand-alone.","""Remember Me"" was a good murder mystery written for teenagers before the genre really became popular. The sequal, on the other hand, seems to follow the pattern set by authors like R.L. Stine-bad writing and storyline, and improbable characters and dialogue, written as fast as possible. This is what happens when bad books become successful, formerly interesting writers take note of the pattern and start cranking out sludge that refuses to take into account their readers' intelligence. ""Remember Me 2"" wasn't the worst example of this pattern, but it's definately inferior to its predeccesor."
3,I am never completly satisfied,"The story is mostly about how Shari is in the ""other relm"" and about her trainer telling her what is going to happen. She is in Jean's body but not completly. It was very confusing. I think the switch wasn't permenant until the end."
1,Unconvincing and illogical,"Butler is very thorough in cataloging the instances of both Greek words in the NT, but his logic in comparing them is lacking. Much of his argument rests on the fact that since both words are used in regards to the same relationships (i.e. God to man, Jesus to disciples, disciples to God, etc), they must mean the same thing. Butler is presupposing that phileo and agapao both should be defined as ""love."" This is the fallacy of begging the question. We use multiple words to describe our relationships to other people; this does not make them synonyms. To apply Butler's method to English: If I say, ""I think about Jane"" and ""I talk about Jane,"" think and talk must mean the same thing!"
3,Take A Razor To Your Head,"I bought this on vinyl when I was 11. I played it incessantly at the time. Less skilled technically than Restless, and tamer than the Meteors, but still a fine, fun album.Anyway, how can you *not* own an album with a track called ""Take A Razor To Your Head""?"
4,Great!,"I just got this in the mail today, and i love it! But when I got it, it was huge! I had to pin part of it to fit my hand... And it makes my hand look quite fat.But the quality is very good! It looks kinda of weird because of the 2 types of fabrics, but overall, it is worth your money if you are a bleach fan or want to cosplay Rukia! :)"
1,Doesn't work very well - adapter is junk,"I saw a deal in SkyMall magazine, through TigerDirect to get this retractable cable for free after rebate. I also got a whole kit, with a bunch of different retractable cables. The USB cables all worked OK (don't expect high-speed support!). But the ""A-Male to B-Male"" adapter that is supposed to allow you to use it as a device cable is worthless. I tested it by plugging it into my scanner. The scanner made some noise, which verified that it was plugged in. But that was it - it would not scan. I plugged in a regular USB 1.1 cable, and the scanner worked perfectly - at USB 2.0 high-speed, even. I would not recommend this cable."
1,Does not work with iPod Shuffle,I purchased this item to make it easier to connect my iPod shuffle to my PC and to recharge. I was disappointed that it did not allow me to connect to my PC and did not work with my charger. Wasted money. Oh well....
4,"Physics, No. Engineering, Yes","After reading through all the reviews and quickly attempting to discern the background of each reviewer through contextual clues, it has reinforced the idea that physics majors hate this book and engineers enjoy it.Speaking as a prior physics major and now currently an EE major, I have seen both types of texts. A dynamics book would cover the subject with much less explanation (while allowing more critical thought, although requiring a much closer reading) and leave it up to the reader to fill in the pieces. A great exercise in the critical thinking physics majors need.Engineers need to know the facts and how to approach the problems to get a meaningful result and this is exactly what the book provides. I was bothered by the presentation in this regard having used physics texts but I have seen much much worse.Like the title of the book says, its applied fundamentals of emag and that is exactly what is laid out in the text."
4,Simple and Clear - Good Backup for Physics Majors,"Good coverage of the basic concepts of E+M. I found this text very useful as a backup for Griffiths E+M (standard undergrad text for physics majors). The math is simple (not a legendre polynomial in sight) and the concepts are clear. The coverage of static fields in materials is especially easy to understand. You're not going to find the dielectric tensor covered here, just the basics layed out in an intuitive format."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics (5th Edition)The author of this book currently teaches at in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at my University (Univeristy of Michigan -- Ann Arbor), which is surely one reason why the book is used in the electromagnetics courses (200-400 level undergraduate) here. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the book does contain a lot of useful formulas, however it only derives a few of them. Furthermore, from reading this book, I did not gain any intuitive understanding of most of the fundamental concepts of electromagnetics (which is probably my single largest criticism of the book). Instead, I got through my courses by searching for the right formulas for a given problem, which I hate doing. I've heard other students at my school rave about this book, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
3,A note about the INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"If you're thinking about getting the International edition of this text to save money, you should be aware that it is slightly different! The problems at the end of each chapter are different--they'll have a 3 where US edition has a 5, there will be an extra part to a question, etc. Just something you should know if you'll have homework problems assigned from the text! Wish I had known... :("
3,Good book but.......,"I think the approach to this book is appropriate and covers many aspects that are required knowledge. The use of color is good and the typing can be easily read. I would have preferred a taller rather than wider book, but that is just my preference.In terms of problem solutions I can't really make a judgment as I havn't done enough of them. I was working through problem 9.24 of the international edition and the solution on the CD appears to be wrong. Should it really be +j0.6 degrees as part of Er in part (b).? However, I can't confirm this and where does one go to find out if there are any known errors published? (newbee). If you know how this +j0.6 value was obtained would love to hear from you.The book is now in its sixth edition so it must be doing something right as it is continually being used by universities all around the world.cheers...."
1,This book is a joke,"This book is a joke. Throughout the book, figures are missing. The book is also extremely wordy and hard to read. ""Fundamentals of Engineering Electromagnetics"" is much better."
1,Worst EMF book ive seen,"This has got to be the worst book on EMF's I've ever seen. I had to borrow a number of other books on the topic to complete my work. The presentation of topics is awkward at best, and leaves much to be desired. A book that proposes to be teaching the fundamentals should do that, but this book just lists a smattering of facts about EMF's and wave propogation without any semblance of order or reason. Apart from the shoddy treatment of the material itself, the index appears to be for a completely separate book. Not one item listed in the index could be found within ten pages of the supposed location. There was an average of about plus or minus fifteen pages for most entries, and some weren't even in the book at all."
4,"Good, but No waveguides","The book is easy to understand and comes with good examples of applications, yet it lacks a chapter in waveguides and it's too simple for two-semesters courses. The newer edition has more problems,and the CD-Rom which are useful."
3,Good reference but explanations too sparse,"This book is a good reference, but it has much to be desired as a textbook for a serious, college-level course in electromagnetics. The derivations leave out too many important details and the explanations of key concepts are sometimes sparse. Furthermore, the approach is primarily mathematical. The book could really be improved if more emphasis was placed on understanding the physics behind EM theory. Overall, I would recommend the book if you are looking for a concise reference book, but I would recommend that you look elsewhere for a thorough introduction to the material."
3,good deals!,"It was a really good deal, even when you have any problems with the product they help you in anything you need!!!"
5,Outstanding Prose,"Charlotte Boyette-Compo's book grips you at page one, pulls you in, and doesn't let you go. If you want a book that will keep you turning the pages, right up to the conclusion--then look no further. WindFall is an outstanding read.Highly Recommended by this reader!"
2,Greatest jazz personality & pianist during last 50 years,"Dave is the greatest and this performance at Carnegie Hall is a crowning gem in his crown of the best. Just check Downbeat and Playboy polls through the 50's, 60's & 70's. Even now at 75 plus, he is simply the best. Red, hot and Cool!"
5,great sound quality,"The import version of this album was out first but this version has much better mastering. The sound quality is amazing. I used to own the reel to reel tape versions years ago and this CD gets back to that quality (unlike the import version)Oh, and like everyone else has said, this is one of the best two or three live jazz albums ever made."
5,the mother of all live Jazz recordings,"And nothing shorter than that! I first heared these recordings when I discovered my dad's old vinyl collection, too bad the static and noise went out of it now it's on CD, but it doesn't change the fact that this is an amazing album. What starts out as almost a ""regular"" and ""routine-like"" concert suddenly explodes into a breathtaking performance. You constantly hear the musicians challenging each other by changing the tempo and pace, or starting to solo on the opening of a new track (to mislead the others), you constantly hear the audience being overwhelmed and more and more in a trance. And to think the concert was close to being cancelled because of a busstrike!! A must-have for anyone who enjoys good music. This by long is the best recoding Brubeck and Desmond put together. Jazz-drum lovers; there's even a 12-minute, breathtaking solo on it!!!"
4,Facts About the Moon,"Dorianne Laux's book of poetry, Facts About the Moon is a serious and euphonic compilation of work. Throughout most of the book she uses short to middle length free verse. Most of her poems are at least two pages long and use a generous amount of enjambment. Some of my favorite poems include `The Lost,"" ""Facts About the Moon,"" and ""My Brother's Grave."" Her poems some rarely take a sudden turn, but instead they often end up somewhere far from what I expected. For example, ""Facts About the Moon"" begins as the title states, but Laux gracefully begins incorporating the mother to child relationship in parallel to the moon and earth. ""My Brother's Grave"" begins by narrating a trip to her brother's grave and within the first ten lines, readers are able to see her loneliness, but it isn't explicitly stated by Laux until the few lines of the poem. The poem ""The Lost"" describes a rare type of love that is very interesting and intriguing, but also unrelatable."
5,Finding Elizabeth,"I thoroughly enjoyed my journey through the Celtic countryside, so vividly described by Elizabeth. She was compelling in her search for who she was, or who she would/should become. Her defiance of the Bishop was unexpected, but further defined her character. The ending was totally satisfactory. I hope we hear more from Emily Tipton Williams."
3,mystery,I enjoy reading these as a somwhat guilty pleasure. Love the setting and the relationships.I read all her books.
4,stumped,"i am always trying to guess ahead on ""who done it"" and this one had me guessing wrong the entire time. right to the end i had no clue because so many hints lead me astray. enjoyed the details and look forward to the next book in the series to arrive."
5,Highly recommended!,"I love this CD! Ten Shekel Shirt have a really great sound and their song lyrics are beautiful. I think the best music comes from artists who love God, and you can tell this band love Him. I look forward to the release of their new album."
3,God reading,"Good reading, although it is a little heavy reading for this old country boy. Pretty good educational stuff though. Good literature for college level."
4,Classic poems of the far North,"Everything I expected, this complete collection of Robert Service's poems captures the spirit of the rugged lives of those who struggle against the harshness of the cold and frozen Yukon and other points north. After a recent trip to Alaska where every Bed and Breakfast had a copy, I couldn't wait to get back and order my own. My childhood memory of the ""Cremation of Sam McGee"" only added to my delight of the book. The only drawback you know before you order, it is all one author. Therefore, the style is much the same from poem to poem. However, to me, that just made the rhythm of his words more of a song in my head and I found that delightful. I think you will too."
1,"Little dipper is a true ""crock""","I have a ""Little Dipper"". Please be aware that you CANNOT cook with this--though that is only indicated in the instruction book. The cord for this cooker is too short for safety, making it virtually mandatory to use an extension cord. So much for safety. This is apparently designed for the narrow use of keeping dips warm. This might be acceptable, but the temperature is below the 140 degree level considered a minimum for safety by food service professionals. Also, you really have to heat the food separately and then put it in the pot--a real nuisance. The clincher is that it's a real pain to clean. Do not consider this Little Dipper a ""bonus""! Instead, consider that it probably needs to be discarded."
2,"Disappointing, Classic is not Classic","If you saw an album titled ""Classic"" with a name like George Carlin, Bill Cosby, Robin Williams, Monty Python, you would naturally think Classic = some of the very best bits.In this case classic means real old, not necessarily good. Recorded live somewhere at some time (there is no information on the sleeve), it seems to be very early Connolly, as he is making the transition from folk singer to stand-up comedy. A good amount of the material not only depends on being able to understand a Glaswegian patter, but also requires some geographical knowledge of Glasgow itself. A lot of scatalogical humour, and too many folk singing comedy songs.It is as if this recording company found an old tape of Connolly's that they had rights to, so they decided to cash in.There is a reason the price on this is so low."
4,billy connolly,I think Billy Connolly funny and sharp - his humor is terrific and have watched hisdocumentary to the north a couple times. He's in a movie coming up and I'll see him.I think you just might enjoy his book as |I did.
3,O.K....but not fantastic,"Instead of being slippery beyond belief or great feeling to use, this product is rather mediocre. Yes, they did a decent job making a water based lubricant, but it does dry out somewhat quickly which means applying more and more until it becomes too much and not worth the effort.If you're looking for a great moisturizer for ole willy, then you've found a good one. But, in my opinion, it's so-so for solo action (which is its main function I guess), but NOT recommended for his & her action."
5,An excellent adult fairy tale.,"The Seven Lady Godivas, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written by Dr, Seuss. Yes, that's right! Of course, Theodore Gissel has a great appeal to the young at heart, but this book is a HOOT!"
2,Ok but not quite right,"Worked well for the first month or so but came to hate the remote buttons which stick out from the remote. The result of the buttons being raised allowed the buttons to be pushed when in a purse or pocket, draining the batteries very quickly. The internal gears of the lock seem weak compared to a black and decker one I had several years ago at another location. Occasionaly they would slip if the door was not perfectly centered resulting in the use of the key to open the door."
4,Love it except in the winters,"I love this remote. My boyfriend and I fight to see who can lock the door the fastest. It is fabulous when I get out of the car and don't want to balance keys and items from the car. It has a great range and I often crank my car and lock the door from the car.My only challenge it not necessarily a problem with the lock, but in the winter, my front door shrinks some which cause the deadbolt to not lock or not open. Right now, the lock is not completely opening and I had to use a knife to get the lock to move completely out of the way.Update - 1 year later. The lock broke in the locked position. I had to break into my house through a window. The bolt would NOT MOVE. I had to unscrew the lock from the inside once I got in, and had to replace the lock with a regular one. I ruined the doorframe trying to pry the lock back and open. I don't regret the lock, but it was a nightmare when it broke."
1,not what it seems,The picture does not show that there is a hugh box on the back of the door which in my case makes this product worthless.
3,"Handy.....""IF""","Purchased for my father who is in a wheelchair and needs the remote option.Well, i do not recall reading anything when we purchased this unit aboutit not perforning if you have s steel (metal) core door.We end up findig this out within the first week of frustration.The CSR told my father that this a a common problem.Well.....if that's the case, why not add that to your item description ????We were told that if we made a ""gasket"" out of thin rubber or cork that would solve the problem. We'll see....."
2,Loved it... for about 3 months,"Oh you'll love this door lock... for about three months. At first it's really cool: Remote control operation, no more keys... but then you hate it. Because the key fobs break (I've had to replace two). They're cheaply made. The buttons protrude, which leads to accidental unlocking and battery drain. The deadbolt often gets stuck. This thing is the technology of the future, if you're living in 1982. Also, the customer service is terrible. Trust me on this, it's fun for a bit but then you hate it. I'm only on Amazon because I'm shopping for new locks..."
5,Awesome gift,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it! I was able to use with existing outside hardware(not allowed to change b/c of HOA rules) I highly recommend for people that always have their arms full!
3,Great Product Remotes Suck,"This product is great for me. I live in a condo and my first floor is the garage so when ppl come over and leave and I do not have to go up and down a flight of steps to lock and unlock the door. But if you have to keep the remote in a pocket, like everyone else said the buttons are raised up. So in pocket, purse, or whatever the batteries drain in a day or two."
1,hidden pitfall,"This device looked like the solution for my porch access gate. The situation does not need high security just controllable privacy. The product picture shows a conventional deadbolt and says it is just a drop-in replacement. What they DON'T show is the backside (inside of door). Instead of a conventional key lock (double bolt) or a thumb knob there is a very large box (about 2"" x 5"") that houses the batteries and electronics. First, it is too large to fit most deadbolt/doorknob installations, and second it is not weatherproof so it must be on an interior side.I really don't know who could use this. It is suitable for a door with ONLY a deadbolt (no knob) and with one side protected from weather."
4,"Difficult to assemble, totally worth it","I JUST finished putting this together and after seeing some of the bad reviews, I'm happy to say I received no warped pieces. That being said, it was a pain in the neck to assemble for me, there were a lot of bad words and a couple blisters involved...HOWEVER...looking at it now I am sure it was totally worth the effort. it is solid and sturdy and I know my little girl is going to love it!!"
5,Worth every penny,"This is a versatile doll house. Our girls (8 and 5) enjoy playing with it. Sometimes they each take a section and play separately, other times they play together. I have been told that there are three toy types which will hold kids' interest through years of play: doll houses, toy kitchens, and building tables (duplos, Legos) -- this has been true in our home. This doll house is an investment in long-term quality play for your child(ren). I anticipate that we will still have this doll house when grandchildren come to our house for visits. We bought this doll house in '11."
5,Lovely dollhouse,My daughter and her friends love this dollhouse. It's absolutely beautiful and the orange matches the colors in our sitting room. I loved it so much that I bought a tiny coffee table with a drawer in it to hold all the dolls (sold separately) and furniture. it is played with every single day.Assembly was a pain but I am not very handy and I was tremendously proud of myself when I was done.
5,dollhouse,We were very pleased with this dollhouse and so were the children. Before it was even finished being constructed they were playing with it.
2,Furniture Falls Apart,"We've had this for a year, and my kids rarely play with it. Everytime they set up the house, the furniture breaks. Whether it is the steps falling off, or the bunk beds separating, it's very dissapointing for the kids. My kids are not unusually hard on toys, in fact very few things have ever broken. I bought this to be more gender neutral since we have 4 kids, but I wish I had stuck with the reliable Fisher Price plastic house."
1,Plan Toy Chalet Doll House with Furniture,This was for one of our grand daughters. My son and I put it together for her. We were disappointed that two pieces were missing and that our son will have to contact Plan Toy's to obtain the two missing pieces. This is a well-designed toy but Plan Toys should increase their back-check of the toy pieces before shipping.
2,Can't fit furniture because of sloped roof,"We purchased the Chalet without furniture because we own the Plan Toy Neo furniture sets (living room, bathroom, kitchen, dining room, bedroom, and children bedroom). Unfortunately many of the upright furniture pieces do not fit because they're too tall and hit the sloped roof (such as the shower, dresser, bookcase, vanity table, floor lamp, etc). I would not recommend the Chalet unless you're buying the set with furniture (where the pieces are probably scaled to fit the low ceilings). It's too late for us to return because we opened and assembled it. I wish someone had mentioned in their review and saved me the money."
4,2nd floor issue,"The Plan Toys Chalet Doll House has been great with the exception of an issue with the 2nd floor of the main section. It came to us warped making the door between floor 1 and 2 very tight, and the door between floor 2 and 3 fall over. However, I called Plan Toys and they immediately sent a new 2nd floor piece to me, and now it is fine. Overall, it was simple to put together, although I would like written instruction to go along with the pictures. The pictures were very clear, I just do a bit better with words. Overall, I would recommend this dollhouse. My 3 year old is loving it!"
5,Six Thumbs Up!!,"I bought this for my granddaughter, at the suggestion of my daughter; we all love it. It's very well made, easy to put together and the furniture could not be nicer. I've recommended to many, already."
4,Alot of Bang for the Buck,"This heater does a great job of heating my 24x26 two car garage in northern Indiana. It arrived from the seller within 48hours of placing my order with standard delivery. The only thing that keeps it from being a five star is lack of a mounting assembly. A little bit of chain wrapped around a ceiling joist took care of that though. It does require a special 240 volt outlet, but the materials to run it can be purchased at any home improvement store. It took me about 20 minutes to run the wire and install the outlet and breaker."
3,Heater Review,"Heater shipped later than projected date, probably due to the Holidays.Heater arrived in good condition, with no dents or tears in the box.This heater is noisier than I expected, but really does a great job of heating up my shop."
3,Dayton 3VU36 (in lieu of Marley),"Why am I reviewing a Dayton in lieu of Marley? Because I ordered the Marley but I received the Dayton. The unit has the same specs as the Marley and it performs well so I am keeping it, rather than going through the a return and reordering from a different supplier (plus it is cold out and we need it now for a band rehearsal studio). I am down grading to three stars (from the five that the unit deserves) since we were not notified that the it would be a substitute product. The delivery time was excellent (especially during the week before Christmas). Also, I called the supplier and they were willing to take the unit back if I was not satisfied (I give them credit for that)."
4,Greeks / Romans,"This extensive work is a great compilation of the ancient Greek and Roman military history. Very detailed specially on armor and weapons with additional details on battles and wars fought by those great ancient armies. I wish the detail of arms an armor could be downsized concentrating more on circumstances of the battles, reasons of such developments and conclusions.Congratulations to author Peter Connolly!"
4,Must have?,"Well, what can I say?This is a great book for anyone even remotely interested in this period. It gives you the broad perspective, as well as details. Best of all the author gives ample archeological evidence and often comments on how he was able (or not) to use the weaponry.You really get to feel the period with the Greek politics and Roman tenacity and understand how thing happened.This might not be your book if your interest primarily is about wargaming. But if you want more than only a game then this is the book to buy and get a better understanding why battles were won and Nations lost."
4,good simple introduction,"Connolly has written an almost comparative book which lays out clearly some of the agreed upon and not so agreed upon ""facts"" about ancient warfare in Greece and Rome. This is a great starting point for research into ancient war and weapons though not detailed enough for the specialist."
4,"Product as promised, a bit slow to ship","The product was delivered as promised. It took about a week to ship, but then I got a tracking number and it arrived promptly. I was happy with the transaction."
3,Worthwhile if only for the cover.,"Such a good voice, good song selection, a nice mix of rhythms and tempos. And so nice to watch during a performance. Even just on CD - she's worth listening to!"
3,hollywood version,"If this is to supplement the book ""In His steps"" be wary. The book differs a bit with plot and characters. If it is just to be a movie to give you something to think about then enjoy the show. The movie is based on the premise that we need to be Christlike in all that we do and sometimes our carnal common sense screams ""surely that is not what the Lord wants me to do."" In the movie the characters make a promise to follow in the Lord's steps in everything they do for a period of time through wealth and poverty with decisions that are tough to make. Thought provoking if nothing else."
1,Not worth the price,"I purchased this Toy Chest since it was in sale and got it today and we started assembling. When we put the screws and tighten the wood cracks in several places. I don't know how many days its going to last. I dont know why people use pressed wood for this kind of piece and sell it for $[...]. This piece is not definetly worth the money. Please starting using solid wood or anything that does not crack. I love the look, but that deceives. My son loves to sit on it, but I am worried that it will break someday. By the way the Instructions for Assembly given with the product is should be much more clear and step by step."
2,"Cheaply made, so don't expect much","I figured for over $100 I would have received something of better quality. There were minor scratches on most pieces and the graphics were slightly smudged. Nothing major enough to go through the hassle of taking it apart, packing it back up, and dealing with the return process. Assembly didn't go well, the included screws broke (I broke three of them, only by using a handheld screwdriver, the heads twisted right off). I ended up having to drill extra holes since the included screws broke off. Also, the instructions (the usual Chinese wordless instruction sheet) didn't put things together in the right order, so you ended up having to improvise. Parts of it are little more than cheap press board. I have my questions on whether or not it is going to last in my son's room more than a year or two.All in all, just know you're paying $100 for a cheaply made Chinese made novelty item, not a real piece of furniture."
3,Pittsburgh Pirates Toy Chest,"Negatives -Paint not crisp, smears / smudges in placesDifficult assembly with terrible instructionsNot very spaciousPositives -It's the Pirates!Spring loaded hinges which will prevent bumps on headsBaseball shaped legs is a nice touchServes it's purposeIt's the Pirates!"
3,Disappointed,"Nice box but, I was disappointed that the bottom was a thin board. I was also disappointed that the box arrived with an apparent repaired boken corner that was then put back in inventory to be sold as new."
2,Horrible Gift Experience,"This was a horrible experience in gift giving. I ordered this toybox as a baby gift. First, the website did not let me send a message stating it was a gift, from whom, etc. Amazon was absolutely no help in this arena and placed the blame on the website of the seller. Then I found out the package was delivered to my friends in Albuquerque (I live in Atlanta) with absolutely no assembly instructions. The box was void of any phone numbers or other references to figure out how to request instructions. Without my knowledge, my friends finally found a website site and tracked down the manufacturer to request assembly instructions. This was my first time buying anything from amazon.com and it will be my last."
5,"Yes, there is a way to fix almost anything if you have the right tool!","This is a great reference book. Before I had it a week, I had solved some mysteries about pieces and parts of stuff...and where to buy them, and what they looked like! Of course, sometimes it's fun to just graze through the book and find all sorts of items you didn't know existed. If you're into home repair, or home improvement, this gem is a great addition to your how-to collection."

1,Poor phone and/or service,The phone and/or the service is very poor. The calls sound like I am talking to an alien. I have called Cingular to let them know and all I get is the run around. I was with verizon befor and had NO PROBLEMS with there service at all.I wanted to try cingulr because they have more phones to select from.I now regret going to Cingular and recommend you STAY as far away from them as you can.
1,Terrible for rabbits,"The biggest problem with this litter is that it comes in the form of little balls that are the same size and shape as rabbit poop. There is no way of taking a litter scooper and simply sifting the rabbit droppings from the remaining clean litter. My rabbit prefers the litter to stay clean and it's hard to do that if I have to hand-pick pellets out. If you simply pour all the litter out and do a fresh one on an almost daily basis, you'll be paying $6.00 more than twice a week easy on this stuff. That's the other problem...for the price, you don't get very much litter to work with.My only positive is that it does seem to control the odor."
5,Wonderful stuff,"With this stuff I had my rattie litter trained in no time, and it keeps her cage smelling so much cleaner. She doesn't object to the way it feels under her feet, and she doesnt try to eat it. She hasn't scuffed it out of her litter box since the first day I used it, and she seems to like it better than the other litters I tried during litter box training."
1,aaaaahhh!!!!!!,i filled my rabbits liter box with this.it seemed fine before i went to bed.when i woke up all the litter had melted into sludge.it took me three hours to clean out the litter box and i ended up throwing away the rest of the litter.
1,Not Good For Rabbits,"I bought this for my rabbit, and it was horrible.Somehow it got splattered everywhere and thenit turned to a cement like texture in his corner litter box .I had to buy a new litterbox because I couldn't get it out-I am sticking to Yesterday's News."
3,Litter bigger than expected,"The little balls of litter are bigger than I expected (I was expecting something along the lines of the Super Pet litter/cat litter). My hamster likes to kick it around, so at least he's having fun. I'm not sure if it's the best at absorbing urine, either because I don't always change it everyday, or because the balls are so big that the urine just runs through to the plastic litter box.Works, but not great."
3,"Good Product, but not what I was looking for","Bought the 4-lb resealable bag of litter for my hedgehog thinking it would be similar to Super Pet's Potty Litter that comes in the smaller box. These pearls are much bigger, probably for a larger animal like a Ferret or Rabbit like they have on the package. They are too big for my hedgehog, looks like I will have to buy multiples of the small box instead. Wish they sold the small grade pearls in larger bulk."
5,Frantic Flintstones first Album,"This is a first Frantic Flintstones album on legendary Nervous label. I wonder if they titled it after this???Very successful. Vocalist Chuck Harvey (aka Chuck Flintstone) is on the way to the top here. Gary Day is a very talented double-bassist, and guitar licks are cool on some tracks. Nearly all songs are classics today. 17 tracks of fun and frantic rockabilly."
1,"Completely unreadable, do not buy this edition!","At the onset of this edition of ""Equality,"" the publisher attempts to explain why the rest of the book is an unreadable, haphazard mess of random letters, spacing, and punctuation. Apparently this book was scanned using (very poor) optical character recognition. The publisher, General Books LLC, did not find that they needed to edit this in the slightest. As a result, your reading experience will be flooded with phrases like this, an actual quote from this book: ""owner's v legal righL af.-e?eciijig-the occupant."" The chapters are also not organized properly, paragraphs are spaced terribly, and unnecessary line breaks run amok.Save yourself the hassle of trying to interpret this machine-scanned garbage, and buy a legitimate copy of Equality from a legitimate publisher."
1,what a waste of my time,I can't believe we actually pay anthropologists to find out such worthless facts about people from who knows and who cares where.
5,"Interesting, orginal fantasy","I'm pretty new to the fantasy genre so I'm probably being a bit lenient in this review. To me this story was unique. The history about the demons living on earth and being run off by humans was intriguing. You'll find the usual commonly used fantasy creatures alomg with some interesting new ones such as the leshies. The characterization was great. Most of the main characters developed throughout the whole story. The writing was typical for a bean book , nothing too fancy but enough detail for your imagination to bring the story to life."
3,Short Cord,"Gets the job done with an extremely short cord (2ft.) If you want good products the general rule-of-thumb for anything is, always go first party. Always buy an accessory from the people who make the primary device. Better luck next time."
1,Champion Sports High Density Coated Foam Softball,"This Product does not come close to the Jugs version of foam practice balls. The quality is horrible and was delivered deformed. Finally, The seller of the product sold it for $13.95 per ball. The Jugs were a dozen for $30."
2,Lame...,"Some Playboy DVDs are pretty good, some, like this one, are not. The models are OK, just OK. If you can pick it up for less than $5 with shipping, then it might be worth it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."
5,Grande Laura,"A portrait of Laura's great 2005 World Tour.Well sung, well recorded, well packed..in a few words, absolutely PERFECT!"
5,Laura Pausini - AWESOME singer.,Laura Pausini is an AWESOME Italian singer. She can also sing in other languages too. Very talended.
4,Good representation of her works,"A couple of the songs are not the full length album versions. Also, the songs on the CD are not in the order in which they were released. Still, this is a very good compilation of Sade's songs. Anyone that has heard and liked her will like all or at least most of the songs on this CD. Of course, anyone that has listened to her albums may find songs missing but that's because her sound can be very soothing and likable. It's a good CD to just let play without having to select songs off it."
5,The Real Soul: Accept no imitations,"Before that neo-soul genre, there was Sade, and though this compliation came out during the pre-Lovers Rock times, it's still pretty accurate. But where's ""Sally""?"
5,Viva Sade Adu!!,"Sade is the best artist in the music industry, and the least appreciated. Her music is original, breathtaking and absolutely flawless! And I love the way she never rushed out a CD just to leave her fans with a half done mess while she walks away with dollars like some of the more praised artists has done in the past. To me, ALL of Sade's songs were her best, and I would recommend everything she has done to anyone."
5,Jazzy!!!,"If you like Jazz, you'll like this album. EVERY song is a MASTERPIECE. Be sure to get this album because it will suit your moods whether you're happy or sad or neutral"
5,"So Simple, so relaxing","Sade has simple lyrics. BUT they are so profound at the same time. Her voice can soothe like few others. The title says it all, the BEST of Sade."
5,The emotions and grace Sade express are very exquisite.,"Since I was a little girl growing up in the mid eighties, I've always thought of Sade as a classy,yet powerful singer. Her voice holds so much passion and assurance throughout all her songs. And speaking of her songs, this is definitely the type of artist, who you should listen to while you're with that significant other. Sade, thank you for making these songs, and for the sweet serenity moments I spend enjoying your talent."
4,Everyone Needs at least One SADE CD,"If you don't have Sade's ""Diamond Life"" or even if you do, this ""Best of""CD is a welcome addition to any music collection. This unique singer continues to haunt me like the girl from Ipanema."
