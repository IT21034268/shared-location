4,All is Good,"Everything that I have ever ordered has worked well, I have never had to return anything. I have ordered at least 20 or 30 items and All is Good."
1,Software ???,The software for this is useless and I still havent gotten it to work I have had it fro over a month. I finally went with the Verizon cable and software worked like a charm. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Doesn't work with my SCH-U740,I attempted to use this product to connect my SCH-U740 to my Mac and it did not register. Fairly disappointed!
2,A lesser Poirot,"This is another of the more recent and generally dreadful Poirots shown originally on A & E and filled with scores of commercials. (The action stops every five minutes after the opening half hour.) The acting, aside from Suchet of course, is especially weak and the story is predictable. Is this really better than watching golf? Either way, you're in danger of falling asleep hours ahead of time."
5,A great Christmas tradition,"We first watched this video at our church, and I was instantly captivated. I immediately came home to look up other videos Joe Castillo has done. Our church let us borrow this to watch at home, along with The Passion and The Prodigal. Both The Passion and The Prodigal take the camera away from just his hands and cut to him in front of a big spotlight, or him in front of a screen doing it live for an audience. Although it was nice to see him doing it, I really liked the fact that The Miracle of Christmas kept the camera focused solely on his hands. The total length is 18 minutes long, and both my 2 yr old and 5 yr old loved it as much as my husband and I. Compared with other sand artists (or even ketchup and pudding artists, as my friend showed me), I really prefer his style because he does it in real time set to the music. The other artists I found speed up their videos and then put music over it, or they don't add near the detail he does."
5,Lloyd's Laws Made Us Lots of Money,"CNBC and NPR are right: Money may not be but funny but Simple Money Solutions is humorously written, unique and filled with money-making gems. One thing that really makes this book stand out from the others is what Nancy calls ""Lloyd's Laws."" These are simple to follow bits of useful financial and life wisdom that make the book easy to read and showed us how to manage our finances without pain or too much effort. They are time tested and to the point insights into money that we never read or heard elsewhere. This book is truly the one and only money book that worked for us."
5,Why this book is better than the others,"I have bought dozens of money books but the problem with many of the other ones is that they are written by financial planners. And when financial planners write books they push things (like large, long mortgages, variable life insurance policies and annuities) not because they are good for you, but because they will generate big commissions and bonuses for the financial planners (or their peers). Simple Money Solutions is different.For one thing, Nancy Lloyd is a consumer reporter. So in this book she really does put our interests first. She not only gives unbiased financial advice, she also exposes the hidden costs and hidden risks of dozens of financial products that other authors (who happen to have a financial interest in them) are touting. If you want true financial freedom, this is the best book of the year. Don't take my word for it, Money Magazine, Morningstar, CBS MarketWatch and USA Today all gave this book rave reviews. And deservedly!"
5,Great book for MEN and WOMEN,"At last, a financial advice book that my husband and I both find interesting and informataive. We're actually enjoying reading it!Simple Money Solutions does not talk down to women like so many books marketed at ""women"" do. This book just explains financial information in a clear and concise way. Whether you are sophisticated about finances or not, you will find a treasure trove of very useful information between these covers.Our favorite sections so far are the advice about 401(k)s, IRA's, and buying and selling a home.We also liked the ""Jumpstart Your Finances"" section at the beginning of the book. We could apply Nancy's advice and see immediate results.We highly recommend Simple Money Solutions."
1,Please save your money,"This is one of the worst books written on finance. Nancy lloyd has a lot of fluff in this book and its only marketing. Iam glad my friend lent me this book and I didnt have to pay money for this POS. Compared to the peter Lynch and Graham book, this one is surely aimed for preschool toddlers."
3,skewed reviews make me go to library first!,"I was initially ready to buy this book based on the reviews. Soon it became apparent that the same individuals were padding the reviews for some unknown purpose. I can't trust the reviews so I'll check this book out of the library and make my own decision. By the way some ""reviewers"" make mention of estrogen therapy during menopause, and related books, in their ""hit list""--two-for-one book review fakery. Do yourself a favor and investigate Dr. Lee's studies on natural progesterone instead. It was a miracle for me."
5,Road to Riches==Humorous and Helpful,"Books like this don't come along often. That's not to say that there are not hundreds of money books out there. It's just that most of those other books do not work. Nancy's book is (as Amazon said in their review) ""an entertaining exception.""It's fast to read. The advice is easily understandable and quick to implement.If you take the time to read it (and you can read it cover to cover in a few days) you will find that your bottom line has gone up. Mine did. And so did my brother's and sister's who borrowed my copy. Since I have found this book so incredibly helpful I bought each of them their own copies and they're now sharing them with friends and family.And we all are literally the richer for reading this astounding book."
4,This is a good book!,"I really liked this book. It was an excellent book until the heroine came in, then it fell just a little. I still liked it though. I found it to be very interesting. Alice Hoffman is one of my favorite authors because she writes wonderful novels, this one was no different."
4,Property Of,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It gives an insight into the relationships among gang members. I continue to love Alice Hoffman's use of imagery, plot and character deveopment. I'm continuing to read my way through the remainder of her titles."
2,This book was very disappointing.,"Sorry Alice, you are my favorite author but this is the worst book you have ever written! This book is basically about a post Vietnam war gangster scene and a girl who will do anything to belong. However, not only was the portrayal of violence swayed toward dark comedy. Many questions were left unanswered. Consequently, the scene is drab and never changes and always refers to the street or the gangster's club house. I wanted more! I wanted to know who the main character's family was, and who MckKay really was. This book was very disappointing and although I love Alice Hoffman's books I would have to say you are better off to skip this one."
4,Early Alice - raw and intense,"I have read every Alice Hoffman book.This was her first, and in it was a raw intensity which kept me anxious.The topic is tough, and I kept hoping for the young woman to find herself.Good to see her first work which set a tone for later projects and characters."
4,devotion/love of a gang member,"If I had known that this was going to be a story about the love of a gang member, I know I wouldn't have chosen it, and consequently I would have missed a very good book."
4,Being Wanted,"Property of is a book about drugs, love, scandals, and fitting in. It is an excellent book written by Alice Hoffman. She is my favorite author. I am never let down when I pick a book to read by her. Property of is about a girl who wants McKay, the leader of the pack on the avenue. She will do anything to get him to love her. She will lie for him, do drugs for him, or anything just to be around him. She loves McKay so much. She doesn't belong to him though. She belongs to no one. When McKay starts doing heroine and can't stop, will she know what's best for her? Will she still want to love McKay? The book will make you see how someone can really be in love to dedicate themselves to a person. It is a great book that is worth reading. Once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down."
5,One of my Favorites!,"The only books I've read by Alice Hoffman are 'Property Of' and 'Practical Magic'. I hope they never make a movie of 'Property Of', thereby ruining it. Potential Readers: Try and ignore the naysayers. Why pick apart things you don't like when all the things put together make the novel what Ms. Hoffman intended it to be? True, heroin and gangs suck in real life. Just because you might never have wanted to belong so badly doesn't make the book a bad one. I still have my original copy from 78? 79? and it's coming apart. I'm buying another copy because I want to pass this one on...This is a great book. Dark, yes, depressing at times, yes. But very realistic to falling in love with a guy who doesn't know what love is."
3,Better Editions Are Available,"My review does not concern the content. Rather, I just wish to point out that the Modern Library edition is complete and unabridged in one volume (over a thousand pages) for less money than the Penguin edition. Also the Modern Library edition has helpful glosses that summarize each paragraph. Plus, for those with a preference, the Modern Library edition has footnotes instead of endnotes.Just a heads up."
2,Book to kinda to hard,"Im 15 and wanted to read this book. Its okay in some parts, but almost all of it i have to reread a few times to get what its saying...then i would forget.. Ill try reading it when im older. 16 or 17"
2,The apology for exploitation,"Two hundred years ago capitalism was really beginning to take over as the dominant economic system. Capitalism was at the time a system allowing an economic and scientific growth, much faster than under the feudal systems, and played a progressive role. However capitalism led to a new kind of oppression of the working class. Adam Smith gave the bourgoise a theory stating that their oppression of the working class was for the common good of all mankind, thus serving as an apology for oppression.This book is a lousy apology. Capitalism is an old-fashioned economic system, ready to become buried on the scrapyard of history. Workers of all countries, Unite!"
1,Blinded by bitterness,"Anyone who has spent time in Brazil will clearly see that the author of this book is constantly either blowing all brazilian bad qualities way out of proportion, or twisting information to create some that simply don't exist. He seems to be a very bitter man blinded by his bitterness and everything he sees is inherently bad. Only people who has never been to Brazil will find this book interesting and that is because they don't realize that it is just a sequence of either inaccurate or absolutely false information. Only people with a tendency to bitterness will be able to see humor in it. If you truly want to learn about Brazil and Brazilians you shouldn't read this book."
5,Call out Rush Limbaugh!,The poignant thing about this book is that the author lived outside the USA for too long a time. When he wrote the book he didn't realize that America and Americans are well on their way to becoming just like the Brazil and Brazilians he describes. Gore and Lieberman sound like they are already somewhere beyond that point. Call out Rush Limbaugh!
4,Solid PPV,"Has a lot of solid matches. The seemingly never ending feud between Del Rio and Sheamus was one of the biggest detriments as it was slow, boring, clumsy, and really something one can skip over. Match of the night by far is Punk vs Cena. These two definitely know how to create a great match and they show it here. So overall definitely worth a look if only for the punk/cena match."
1,Aging,"This book uses an interesting comparision of the mythical figure Ulyssus and the aging process. Although interesting, there is little practical substance to apply to the average person who suffers the negative effects of aging."
2,How can this not have Noticeable One?,"I found out about Missing Persons by hearing the song Noticeable One on the radio. To date, it remains my favorite song by them. It is unfathomable that this song isn't on a greatest hits album. My opinion? Go buy Spring Session M instead. It's a way better CD from beginning to end."
3,"Ohh..., that band.","Missing Persons is a band that often gets forgotten because they were never really a big name, but they were more than a one song band too. They're one of the few 3-hit-wonders out there. I think ""Words"" was the first single people heard. Their two other essential songs ""Walking In LA"" and ""Destination Unknown"" are here also. Soo much fun, and the rest is nearly as great. Dale is such a strong singer and frontwoman. Sometimes I feel like I'm listening to Cyndi Lauper front the Divinyls...or something like that. An underrated band anyway no matter what genre they're put in. New Wave, 80's pop, synth. It's a sound that's really ""missing"" from music today."
4,memories,"I first heard Missing Persons on 91.1 WRVU in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the radio station for Vanderbilt University and the only place in town that you could here New Wave music in the early 80's. I went out and bought the EP cassette immediately. I also remember watching the movie ""Lunch Wagon"" which featured the group (someone else's review couldn't remember the title). Naked women and Missing Persons. Does it get any better? Singer Dale Bozzio was a former nude model anyway. Mental Hopscotch remains my favorite song."
4,Missing Persons - Best of CD,"I would give it 5-stars but it does not have ""Surrender Your Heart"". Sorry!"
2,No undiscovered treasure here!,"Disappointing! Bought it to further investigate the interesting vocals of Dale Bozzio past the three mediocre songs that receive radio airplay. And found nothing else, zippo, nada. A near complete wasting of a real talent. Sad!"
4,"""You Must Not Touch My Brain!""","Set 4 of the Space:1999 rounds out the final 6 episodes from the first season. There are some memorable stories, such as Space Brain and fan favorite Dragon's Domain. The stories still have a pedestrian pace, the dialogue is atrocious and some of the acting questionable. But the production and special effects are top notch.Though, I have to question about the actual prints. Overall, they look great, but episodes like the Testament of Arkadia has a very dark look to it, almost if the transfer from film to DVD wasn't done properly. Or was it always this dark? Also, very few extras. It's a shame really, as Space:1999 DVDs released in the UK and Japan have far more extras, and the selection screens far more creative. France has just released the entire series on one huge boxset with loads of extras, including an episode of UFO. Still, without A&E's release of this program, I probably wouldn't have been drawn back into it. It's stills loads of mindless fun..."
4,Love Space 1999!,Space 1999 is just such a guilty pleasure. It is like a hospital floating in outer space with that giant white set. Can't wait until the Maya episodes!
3,Coulda been better,"The transfer of these shows is a disappointment. Guess that after the launch, A&E figured they could put in their second string to transfer this batch.The audio, while free from clicks and pops, is rather limited in bandwidth and muffled. Music wows on the intros when episode returns from commercial break.The video on ""Death's Other Dominion"" suffers badly from streaking which I assume came from the PAL to NTSC conversion, though the other episodes don't have it. ""Full Circle"" is dark and fuzzy (looks like it was noise reduced to hell and the contrast was jacked up to make it look sharp.) The other episodes look ok and aren't a distraction. Still. there's a layer of fuzz over everything.These are some of the best episodes, too bad they didn't receive the care they deserved."
3,*NO DOCUMENTARY!!!,"As far as the episodes go they're great(except the ever cheesy ""SPACE BRAIN"") but I was really looking forward to this documentary. Oh, well."
2,The weakest DVD set of the first season,"I would not recommend this DVD set of Space: 1999, because it has some of the silliest episodes of the first season. Most notably is the episode, The Full Circle, which I thought was similar to watching an episode of Gilligan's Island. The crew of Moonbase Alpha go down to yet another planet, walk though the mist, and become cave people. The last bad episode worth mentioning is The Last Enemy. On the one side of the battle that Moonbase Alpha gets caught up in are military women who look like they've just come from the hairdresser, or are backup singers for the Swedish group ABBA, and the other faction consists of an old man with his eyes closed. This was a bad episode, I mean REALLY bad, like Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad.One halfway decent episode, which is why I give this DVD set a rating of two stars, instead of one, is War Games, which has the greatest number of explosions and destruction since the first episode, Breakaway."
4,this is what is on each disk!,Disk 1: vol 3: COLLISION COURSE: DEATH'S OTHER DOMINIION: THE FULL CIRCLEDisk 2: vol 3: END OF ETERNITY: WAR GAMES: THE LAST ENEMY
4,Gloria's First Album,"I still remember buying this album in Reynosa in 1989, Gloria Trevi was coming out with ""Dr. Psychiatra"". The album was indicative of the success the scandalous Trevi would become in the years to follow."
2,Sorry Nick!,"Okay, there are understated movies and, in this case, movies with no statement to make at all. As much as I am a fan of Nick Stahl, which is why I sat through this, the story was so transparent and the direction so lacking as to make this movie quite lame."
4,Great Flavor when is cooked correctly,"Personally I like them just right out of the Microwave, they feel fresh and warm.The only issue I had is that you need to know how much time you put on the Microwave( since they are not like popcorn that you can hear poping out) you will know when they are ready just by paying attention and carefully listen the little crunchy sound; and is some small Microwave you will need to fold the cornes of the bag, otherwise you will have a scent of burn on you room!!Once you master the cook time, you'll enjoy them most!!"
1,They changed their product,"Lowrey's has changed it's microwave pork rinds. I used to love them. The last order I received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. There is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. The taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. As I said, I used to love the product. I will buy no more Lowrey's microwave pork rinds."
3,Resident Evil 2: The evil returns,"The evil returns with brand new music that is awesome, new enemys, and new guns! This game rocks, frist you choose youre charcter Claire Redifield or Leon S Kennedy. You can fight new enemys like the licker. You learn about the new viriust the G viruis witness an scientist turn into a horrible monster. So I hope you enjoyed my review. Plus when you beat the game you can save it and unlock a secret to play a differnt version of the other chacter. So I hope you enjoyed my review."
3,Needed just a little something special,"The playstation greatest hit gets a near face lift with all of the challenges added and the add on packs. A nice controller and the great interface stay the same. Despite, lacking some more graphics up date it shines on as being one of the greatest survival horror games ever. What makes this game shine is being able to unlock certain options that the others lack. As for the three star ranking what tears that down is the factors that despite being a great game this is the DreamCast not the PlayStation some graphic face lifts would have been nicer. Seeing the lips move, watching the zombies crumble as they walk, and being able to tread blood on the floor as you walk. Don't call it sick but those little things are what set this apart from say Silent Hill 2. Had the technology just did not use it right."
5,"Game worked, casing was awful.","I ordered this version of Resident Evil 2 for the Nightmare mode difficulty setting as I had never played it. Both discs work fine and have no visible wear or tear. The case, however, was badly damaged. The middle piece that holds the CD's was broken off and the manual and rear sheet of artwork were worn and wrinkled."
4,Very good story and setting...,"even better than Code Veronica's setting and story. On the DC the graphics are upgraded and such but are kind of wierd at times, kind of Surreal almost.Be warned, play this before Code Veronica or the less developed graphics will turn RE2 into a joke."
4,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Season 1",Very much enjoying watching this classic sitcom. The character development and interaction is warm and funny. The DVD came in excellent condition and very quick time.The only caveat I have is not the sellers fault: each episode must be individually prompted; there is no 'play all' option.Other than that I recommend this for anyone wondering why this sitcom has become a part of our national vernacular. I think you'll be pleased.
5,Mary!,Gotta love season 1 where it all started. I could watch this over and over and never get tired of it!
4,Mary Tyler Show number 1,First of all the show was a bit slow. But after a while it picked up and was a delight.patricia Wrigley
5,Ted Baxter Rules!,"Mary is great, but my favorite is Ted. His character is absolutely hilarious. I can't wait until Fox finally gets a clue and releases the remaining seasons."
3,A Little Dated,"I was so excited to order this DVD set, but I am a little disappointed. The first season's episodes are really dated. Everyone looks great, and young, but the storylines are kind of silly. Later seasons are probably a better bet."
5,Amazing Picture Quality,"Love is all around, because ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show's"" debut on DVD is fantastic! Gone are the dull, faded, nearly colorless images we've seen on re-runs. The picture quality far surpasses what I had thought possible for the show. Everything looks wonderful! Bright, true-to-life colors (even reds and greens!) and a crisp, clear picture really bring out the details -- especially in the sets and in those great 1970's clothes.In addition to the pristine video, each episode boasts ten chapter stops (bookmarks), and the sound is fine too.This is an excellent season of a great TV series. We can now enjoy a picture to match the high quality writing and acting of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" Treat yourself!"
5,Read Our Lips: Release Season TWO!,"Just when you thought that Fox couldn't get any more clueless comes word that in March they will release a Season One ""Starter Set"" -- a single DVD with four episodes from season one.Now, and here's the really inane part, this single DVD set, which will carry a ten dollar list price, will also come with a ten dollar off coupon for the Complete First Season set. In other words, pay ten bucks for four episodes, then use a ten dollar off coupon (that you have to pay ten bucks for) to buy the Complete First Season set which will then render the ""Starter Set"" obsolete.Attention Fox ninnies: WE WANT SEASON TWO! Why is that so hard for you to grasp?"
3,Love Mary & Rhoda - Season 1 is uneven,"I watched ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" from its first original broadcast to its last. I loved Mary & Rhoda as well as the rest of the cast, even Ted. The actors were all top notch. Watching the first season now, the writer's and the production team were still finding their way. That's typical of most shows in their first year and sometimes into the second year. Most well-written shows usually hit their stride in their third year. I think that the uneveness comes with the too cutesy dialogus in some instances. The standout episode for me was ""Support your local mother,"" which introduced the world to Nancy Walker as Ida Morgenstern, Rhoda's (s)mother. If someone has never seen the show, this DVD set might be worth it. If you have, then I think that catching the reruns should suffice."
5,Finally!!,"Finally they brought the MTM Show out on DVD! This is without a doubt some of the finest television ever produced. Excellent writing, excellent acting, and characters you come to truly know and love. The MTM Show has been a favorite of mine for many years and was so thrilled when I saw they were bringing it out on DVD without commercials and without ""trimming"" minutes to fit more ads into the time slot. The quality is excellent and this is a MUST HAVE collection for any MTM fan. If you're not a fan, you just haven't spent much time watching this delightful series. I understand Season 2 is due out in March '03. I hope so and hope they bring all 7 seasons to us."
4,"Great series, not good DVD","This DVD consists of a great series, but there is the annoying absence of the ability to ""play all"" of the episodes. Instead, you are forced to individually select each episode you want to watch. It is very cumbersome if you desire to watch several episodes in a row, and this feature is present on most TV show DVDs. It needs to be fixed for future releases."
5,You MUST buy this!!!,"What a pleasure it was to watch this series again after these many years.Do you remember this show? If you do, then you don't need anyone to tell you how great it was. If you're new to this planet and have not seen this series, buy this DVD set and find out where today's best sitcoms still get their inspiration. You'll recognize many of today's characters in this ground breaking show. Mary Tyler Moore was the model for many of the great female characters on sitcoms for the past 30 years."
4,Nostalgic!,"I'm an unsual 26 year old. I LOVE the Mary Tyler Moore show. I watched a lot of Nick-at-Nite growing up and the Dick Van Dyke show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and I Love Lucy were staples in my house. When I saw MTM on sale for $20 one day, I had to have it. Because it's actually been many years since I've watched it, I thought I might not like it as much. But, I really did. The characters can still make me laugh. Though the plot lines aren't as stirring as some on TV today, there is something so comforting about the simplicity of the show.There are also great features on the DVD - interviews with many members of the cast, talking about the creation of the show and why it was so popular.If you're a MTM fan, it's well worth it."
5,"Lisa... ""You're The Greatest""","Lisa's style, warmth, depth and fun leads to worlds of pleasure when listening to her music, and seeing her live in performance. ""Lisa... You're the Very Best... Bless You!"""
1,"Monster Rock 12' Guitar Cable, Straight To Straight Plugs","Had mine for 11 months. Started making intermittent noise, which would go away if I jiggled the ends. Became less intermittent and more continuous. I am sending it back for a replacement by Monster under its Lifetime Warranty. Hopefully the replacement lasts longer. Meanwhile, I will play through my 20-year old Whirlwind cable, until the new Monster Rock cable arrives. Disappointed in NJ!"
3,a few complaints,"I have used MANY guitar cables, and I usually try to find good-quality but not too expensive. This was a decent price for what appears to be very good quality. The downside is that it is very stiff and holds it's winding (memory), making it a pain to work with. It catches on things, easy to trip over, etc. Sound-wise it seems fine; I don't notice any difference from my cheaper cables, but I haven't used it for recording where it would be most noticeable. My biggest gripe was the packaging. It comes in a huge, cardboard-and-plastic package that you could fit a garden hose into! What a waste. I wrote to the company with comments, but they did not reply."
4,Straps where they belong!!,"Do your bra straps end off your shoulder and halfway down your arm? Mine did until I tried this bra and now they stay UP. It took a little while to get used to the t-back but once you do, it's very comfortable. I just ordered two more!! Congratulations, Wacoal!!!"
2,A big disapoinment,"Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing). It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it. The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support. Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one."
4,Comfortable bras,I have ordered the padded t-back and the non-padded one (both 38DD the largest size they come in). With the padded one I have experienced the breast to slip out because of the cut (while doing stuff like gardening or so where I bent over and worked for a longer period of time). The non-padded one however is great! I had ENOUGH of straps falling off which is extremely annoying and I found out that I was unconsciensely holding my shoulders up and consequently having cramp in my neck at the end of the day just to prevent the straps to fall off! Today I am ordering another non-padded one. I can run around in this bra and not worry about jiggling and straps. Very comfortable as far as bras go. Sizewise both padded and non-padded fit great however you have to use their sizing table. You might need to order a bit bigger size (specialy cup-wise).
4,Loved it,"I really truly liked this bra I took it out of the package tried it on could have worn it all day. I think they could add more support, and why not add better coverage in the cup. Great Bra!"
2,what is so expensive?,"The first thing you notice about this bra in Toast color is that it looks as a posture correcting device in terms of color, fabric texture, overall design and ugly straps in the back, in particular. So, in short, the look is bad, you cannot undress without scaring your man. Perhaps, in black this bra would look better, but far from being attractive anyway. The cups are very thin, as other reviewers already noticed, but for me it was not a problem. Hence, I give it 2 stars for holding the straps at the center as a T-back supposed. The bust support is OK for one day until fabric stretches. Wonder why it is so expensive if it is neither good sport or comfort bra, nor a sexy dress style."
3,"Ehh,,,,","I've been buying this bra for many years, however it was about 4 years ago when I bought the last one. This new one just doesn't seem like the same quality that it used to be. I ordered two Wacoal bras, they are both made in two different places. This one is made in Dominican Republic, the other one in China. The one from China seems like the old Wacoal quality and worth the money. This one does not, and it certainly in my opinion isn't worth what it cost. The cup fabric looks as if it would wear out quickly to me."
3,"caution, runs small!","Love the way the straps fit in the back, but after 1 washing in cold water(and line dry), bra is already too tight. I'm barely 33.5"" and the 34B feels too small. I might try a 36A instead."
2,"Great Fit, Didn't Last",I loved this bra until the sharp metal underwire cut through the fabric in the front. I don't think this is repairable.
5,Perfect bra for me,"front close, cross back so the straps don't fall off my shoulders. just exactly what I want in a bra. please don't stop selling it."
3,front close t-back bra,The bra has a good price and fits well. Just never had a t-back before and it takes some getting used to having straps more around the neck instead of over the shoulders.
4,I'm satisfied,"This is a good quality bra, especially for the price. True to size cup. I wear mostly minimizer bras (36DD)that don't give me the ""back fat"" bra lines. This bra does give me some of those lines. Otherwise, very nice."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"Although I love the look of the bra, and the size seems fine, I was hoping for something more comfortable. Unfortunately, it seems that when I purchase good looking, somewhat supportive bras, I find them uncomfortable, and after just a short period of time, can't wait to take them off. The comfortable ones may lack style and support but they do offer comfort. If only someone could design the perfect match. Also, this one does show back fat and I was hoping for a sleeker look. I'm a 38D so, unfortunately, in professional settings, I do need to wear a bra with a bit of support. Just haven't found the perfect one yet."
4,Comfy bra but VERY thin,"This bra is very comfortable, but is too thin/doesn't provide enough support for those times my breasts are sore and tender and must be held securely. Other times, it's my go-to bra for everyday wear."
4,wacoal body t-back bra,I love the front closure bras and this one feels comfortable all day. I was happy to find it on Amazon.
3,meh!,It does the job but not with the comfort of some other Wacoal styles. Seems to fun a lttle small but the straps do stay up. YEAH!
3,decent but digs,This bra seemed a little smaller than others I have purchased in the same size. The underwire dug in a little. Not a bra I want to wear all day and evening.
5,best bra ever,This bra was a joy to wear if such is possible in a bra. I to am on the bustier side ( 36DD) and it fit me perfectly. It was completely supportive and comfortable for all day wear.
2,Favorite bra has major flaw,"I love this bra because I have narrow shoulders and the t-back keeps the straps always where they belong (although this is not a good bra for wide neck tops for that reason). It is also very well made, fits well, is comfortable, and looks good under a t-shirt. I have 5 of these in nude in size 38C. Unfortunately, over time, the underwire, which is actually plastic, has broken in every one. Some lasted over a year before this happened; in others, it was less than six months. I wash them in a washing machine, and then hang them to dry. They have never been in a dryer. Maybe if I always hand washed them, this wouldn't happen. It's very disappointing, because they are expensive. I have been meaning to write Wacoal to see if they could supply me with replacement underwires, but haven't gotten around to it. I give them 2 stars because I really do love them, and I did get at least several months of wear out of them. Sigh. Back to the search for the perfect bra."
5,Great bra!,I have a hard time finding a good fitting bra and really wanted a racer-back bra. I'm so glad I ordered this one. The fit is great and it's very comfortable.
5,Quality item,Quality garment - had to return only for fit. Wacoal is a superior like of undergarments. May run a tad small.
1,Not the size it says,"Wacoal Women's Front Close T-Back, White, 36C Size is bad it is not a 36 C. All other bras I have are 36 C this brand is more like a B cup. I will be going back to Glamorize brand or try a different brand."
5,Love this bra!!,This was the best purchase I have made......great bra...if you do not like a lot of padding this is the bra for you. I highly recommend this.
2,not for the big chested,"The quality of the bra seems good and well made. BUT, I am a 38DD and the bra fits tight and cuts into my skin. Some of the bigger sized bras have alittle padding in the shoulders to help hold of the ""weight"", this bra doesn't have that. I gave it two stars because even though it is most defintely not good for me, smaller cup sizes may enjoy the quality of the bra."
3,The Fit,Am going to have to stick to buying my Walcoal at the store. At least this has front closure so I don't need my husband to saddle up the girls. Went by measurement Walcoal rep gave me when I bought my first one at Dillards. It is heaven to wear..this one not so much.
3,"Fits great, comfortable but thin","This bra is comfortable and fits true to size, however it needs to be worn under something that is not thin for modesty reasons! There is no padding and it shows a lot. Not incredibly supportive for larger chested women but nice bra overall. Does seem a bit flimsy for the price point however."
5,"Good Band, Great Collection","The Spencer Davis Group was a great band, and this collection features 15 of their best songs.Other reviewers complained, and made two statements that often enrage about reviews.Firstly, that the collection ""doesn't fill the 80 minutes it could"".So What? Why cram a CD with lesser material when you can have just 45 minutes of brilliant material?Also people always complain about ""sound quality"".I have frankly never heard a CD compliation that I would describe as having poor sound quality.If the complilation is the original recordings and not later rerecordings, it's frankly impossible.Do not forget that these tracks were recorded during the 60s - their sound quality is representative of the recording techniques and technologies of the time, and I believe, add to the feel, style and charm of 60's (or older) music.Pay no attention to other reviewers.This CD has all good tracks, perfect 60's sound quality, and is a steal at a cheap price."
2,Another overrated '60's band,"This greatest hits package demonstrates that The Spencer Davis Group really were just a one hit wonder (and ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" isn't an all-time great pop song, although a previous reviewer is correct in saying that probably every dj that ever played oldies has played it at every gig they've ever done. Quantity of plays doesn't always prove quality, as the works of Michael Jackson amply reminds us). Moving beyond the ""hits"", these songs aren't all that great as individual pieces either. Some band members might have gone on to some other things, but all in all, this group of r&b rockers is pretty mediocre."
3,Bad sound-forget it!,This best of compulation does not sound good at all--stereo sound is infrequent at best and the mono cuts sound muffled-Suggest trying another Best of since there are so many out. Just skip this one-also the choice of cuts for this compulation could have been better selected. Avoid this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,not so great audio,it was in the 60's or early seventy when this group made this tape and then transferred to cd. even at that it could have been remastered.. the music i think is great but the quality isn't... pearsonally i did remaster it in to a wav file and did some enhancing.
5,Why isn't this band blasting from every radio in all the English-speaking countries?,"Here's a band that's from an era when music was music. Here's a band that was not only compiled of great musicians but you can actually tell that together they created something special. This is truly the best of Spenceeeeer....DAAAAVIiiiiis. (I listened to some of their other albums and honestly not all their albums are worth it but this one, it's my new fav album."
2,Hire an editor!,"This review has two parts.1. The information about each episode is invaluable.2. The writing, proofreading, and editing are so poor this book is physically painful to read. It also has no index.If all you want is a list of episodes with information about broadcast dates and casts, do a Google search for the various radio logs available for free on the web. If you want other information about the show wait for the second edition of this book. While waiting, hope and pray that it is edited by somebody who can write proper English. Otherwise, u wil hav truble reeding the furst edition becuz it is writtun bad."
3,"Good info, horrible writing","First, this is an essential book for Suspense fans, with as much info as you could ever hope to find on the subject. It is, however, very clearly fan writing. The prose and binding are terrible. The grammar sets the teeth on edge (the misuse of its/it's being particularly annoying), and the structure is stream-of-consciousness free-association, drifting from one subject to the next and back again with nary a hint of transition. Even a labor of love often needs a midwife, and this author needed an editor badly. Hard reading, but full of info you will not find elsewhere. If you know and love Suspense enough to have read this far, then you really should buy it. It already helped me reorder my collection."
5,EXCELLENT !!!,"ANOTHER EXCELLENT COMPILATION OF MILLIE JACKSON'S WORK . THIS ONE FOCUSES ON HER MID 1980's TO HER MID 1990's MATERIAL . IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE GET IT . ALSO BUY THESE R&B CD's: MILLIE JACKSON-""NOT FOR CHURCH FOLK"",""YOUNG MAN ,OLDER WOMAN""& ""BACK TO THE S**T"",PEBBLES-""SRAIGHT FROM THE HEART"",JODY WATLEY-""INTIMACY"",CHRISTOPHER WILLLIAMS-""REAL MEN DO"",SILK-""LOVE SESSION"",ANN NESBY-""PUT IT ON PAPER"", REGINA BELLE-""THIS IS REGINA"",ANGELA BOFILL-""LOVE IN SLOW MOTION"",ROBIN S.-""FROM NOW ON"",TEVIN CAMPBELL-""TEVIN CAMPBELL"",TEENA MARIE-""IVORY"" & CHAKA KAHN-""COME 2 MY HOUSE"".SIGNED MUSIC FAN."
5,Great book,This is really an awesome book with such valuable information!!! You learn why the irregular people in your life are the way they are and how to deal with them. I highly recommend this book!
1,"This is NOT the audio book version of ""Irregular People""","The CD is actually a seminar session the author did where she talked for about 45-50 minutes about Irregular People. The description led me to believe that this was the audio version of the actual book. If you're looking for the audio book of this title, don't buy this CD. It wasn't a bad talk to listen to, but the audio is very poor quality & sounds like it was duplicated from tape to CD. Sounds very muffled and hard to understand in many places. Hopefully Amazon will make a correction in the description link from the actual book title, which states that this book is available as an audio book, when it's actually not."
1,Victim Mentality,"A horrible book, but it starts out wonderfully. However, Joyce doesn't understand the concept of victim mentality and the fact that she suffers from this form of delusion. A victim of abuse should NEVER return to their abuser, even though this often feels like the natural thing to do. Her advice to apologize to your abuser is so disgusting I can't even put it into words. When I think of all the battered women who might be reading her book, and apologizing to their husbands for the beatings, I almost vomit.God has better plans for us than to keep us in a state of victimhood, which destroys out spirits and keeps us from doing God's work. God may have started the book, but Satan wrote the ending. Joyce should get down on her needs and beg for forgiveness from God."
5,LIFE CHANGING,This book has had a personal life changing effect on me. It has helped me to identify the irregular people in my own life as well as helped me to see how I have been an irregular person to others. It has helped me to repair much damage and heal relationships.
2,Looking for more,"My husband and I were advised to read this book to help with some failing family relationships. I read the book from cover to cover.. hoping for some real direction. Hate to critique...but, I didn't find what I was looking for. I found it outdated, too wrapped with religion and written in too many directions. I believe a book dealing with boundaries might be more suited for our situation - or for someone searching for 'ways' to really deal with irregular people."
5,Classic!!!,"This was Melisa Morgan's classic album that showcased her soulful voice. Every songs on it I wolud listen to over and over. I still have the 12"" vinyl."
3,Pricey for Content,"I have read a lot of things from Shery Ma Belle Arrieta, including her newsletter and trying out her WriteSparks software and have enjoyed all of her prompts and writing suggestions.This book is no exception, as far as the prompts and writing suggestions go. There is, however, a lot of wasted pages in this book and a minor side note, the table of contents is numbered incorrectly. There are lots of blank pages and half of the book is made up of samples of other peoples' writings (which some may find inspirational, but I'd rather write my own material).The writing prompts are good and I would suggest anyone who feels stuck or in need of some ideas read this book, but I would also suggest they find the book at a discount as the retail price is a bit pricey for the 54-56 pages worth of useful content."
5,Review,Definitely worth the money. Great seller! Book in excellent condition and worth the wait. Quick shipment too. Thank you!
4,Review:,"I have a sister who died of Lupus and reading this book really does explain what goes on in your life when someone close to you is ill. Even though you feel hopeless, even though you're scared for that person, you know you have to be strong and cherish every single moment. I enjoyed this book because it reminds you how important your life is. Eileen had brothers,sisters and parents who loved her and even though she was sick she tried to make the most of it which is inspirational to all of us."
5,Helpful for me,"This book really helped to crystallize writing case reports for me. Before reading this I was never happy with my case reports, they felt shallow and insubstantial; never getting across the what I really wanted to express. This book gave me a new way of thinking and expressing the therapeutic encounter in a way that really digs deep and gets across what needs to be understood. Loved the experience of finding a true treasure."
5,Easy and Fast!,"I really enjoyed growing the wheat grass using this package. It was simple, clean, and the grass grew really well! I was pleasantly surprised at how lush and green the grass was. Though my dog doesn't eat it off the stems, I just cut them into smaller pieces over his food. Definitely recommended for the experience, whether your pet will eat it is a different stories, as we all know, the little ones can be picky. =)"
4,Grew like a charm.,"Grew like a charm in the window; per reviews from others I only put about half the grass seed in there and it was still really thick / lush. Of the four cats, only one of them chowed down on it pretty regularly.While the packaging was pretty conveinent, the cats didn't like it very much: even cutting the edges back, the sharp edges of the package seemed to bother them.While this was a neat product and did everything it said it would, in the future I'm just going to get a pot and a package of grass seeds."
3,"Good product, but not tasty enough","This is a great product it grows very pretty, very quickly, but my kitty was not very fond of it. Im not sure what it is, but she would rather eat the grass outside."
3,Cat did not like,"My cat, Miss Princess, did not like this ""grass"" as much as the ""grass"" that I purchased from Wal Mart. The seeds grew nicely, but she was not very interested in the green stuff. I do not think I will purchase this again."
3,"Good package design, not long lasting","The greens were popular when they first grew, but they didn't last long before they started turning yellow.For the same money, I'd just buy grass seed in the future. Good design of the package, though!"
3,My cat cannot digest this grass,"I ordered this product out of curiousity and because of all the positive reviews. My cat would sometimes eat our plants or our neighbors' plants so I thought this product would stop her from doing that. However, whenever she'd eaten a plant, my cat would always end up throwing it up because she couldn't digest it. I thought that she would be able eat and digest this product since it's ""pet greens garden wheat grass."" I had no problem with the growing of the grass. Actually, it grew beautifully (took about 5 days to really start growing out of the bag). However, my cat cannot digest this grass either. Multiple times now she has eaten some grass only to throw it up about 5 mins later. I am somewhat disappointed in the product."
4,Grows as advertised but my kitten's not interested,"Easy to follow directions. Grows a lot of grass. But, how do I get my cat to chew on the grass?"
5,My cat loves the greens!,"My 3 year old Turkish Van (a rescue) loves the Weat Grass, he chews on it everyday. It's so easy to grow, cut the bag down, poke holes in the bottom of the bag with a toothpick or small knife, spread the seeds and push them into the soil and water. It take less than 10 minutes to complete the process and the grass sprouts almost overnight.One bag will last and stay fresh for several weeks."
3,Had trouble growing grass,"I did as other recommended and split up the seeds and dirt, as I read this made a lot of grass. First I split them into fourths and the first batch grew all of three seeds. THREE blades of grass. Well needless to say, that didn't make me nor the kitty happy. So, I grew the rest of the seeds, 3/4 of the package. And thinking I did something incorrectly the first time, I re-read and followed the instructions to a tee, and still received about 10 blades of grass out of all of the rest of those seeds. I will try another brand now. Oh and just FYI, the soil is very organic, and SMELLS very organic! The only place I could store my bag was in the kitchen, but the manure smell is not pleasant in the kitchen!"
4,"Cat loved it, not perfect tho","I've gotten this a few times and my cat has loved it each time. (He is obsessed with grass.) But now that it's no longer free shipping with Amazon I probably won't be ordering it again, which is a shame. Though, now that it's colder, I had a hard time getting it to grow, and when it did grow it didn't last as long... I think I will search for a way to grow grass for my cat that is a bit more permanent than this. But I will miss the ease of use this has, and when it gets nasty (bugs or wilted) you can just throw it away.I gave it only 4 stars because it has to be put in a container, which is not the best solution since if I had a pot for growing things I wouldn't be getting this product."
5,"Great Kit!! I love it, and so does my cat!","This self-grow kit is great! I'm on my 3rd kit now. My cat likes it, and I love it! It is very rewarding to watch as it grows, easy to care and sit beautifully on my desk next to window. Green is always nice:)I got these because my cat seemed depressed at the time and I thought this can be something new for her and fun for me at the same time. The bag becomes a little saggy and dirty after awhile, so I just put the whole thing in a small glass bowl I had and everything is well. I got used to having this little kit on my desk and enjoyed watching the greens grow.Everyone who sits in front of a computer monitor extended period should definitely give it a try, and all cat owners who have a depressed cat should probably get it too. My cat was later diagnosed with IBD but this definitely works in cheering her up"
4,Must cut the grass and hand feed it to your animal,The kit works well and produces a lot of grass. Pretty easy to use if you have the right tool for poking holes in the bottom of the bag. I wanted my cat to be able to munch on this at his leisure but have to cut for him because the grass is so close together he cant put it out on his own. The amount of grass if great. Would prefer a grass that my cat can graze on his own.
4,So simple to grow!,"The bag said to add water and keep in a cool, shaded place. That's all that I did and I had a giant bag of grass within days. I was amazed!When I'm home I put the bag on the kitchen table and the kitties jump up and nibble on the blades of grass. They seem to like it OK, but it seems to be more curiosity than anything else.I looked up whether humans can eat the grass, too, because wheat grass is full of beneficial nutrients. So far I've gotten both yes and no, so I plan to research it more. If I can eat this stuff I'll be psyched! Easiest gardening ever.Gave it four stars because the cats don't love it and it's more of a novelty item. But it's cheap and easy enough and fun to watch them play with it, so why not?"
2,for a small camera,"I have a Canon Rebel T1I, DO NOT buy this bag! IT fits the camera and 1 (ONE) lens. IF that is all you have, then by all means get it! It said it would fit lenses (meaning more than ONE). The table top tripod fits a pocket camera. That tells you right there it's not for a camera with lenses, battery pack, etc.NOW. If you have a small camera this is the bag for you!"
3,what is the measure inside this bag?,"The outside measure says 8.8 x 5 x 7... what is the inside measure? I am wondering if it can hold a Xsi with 18-55mm, 430EX II, + 55-250mm."
3,"Good Price, Good Product","Overall I would say a pretty decent product, the construction is high quality and the utilization of space is alright. If you are looking to put a lense and a large SLR camera, say a D90 in the bag, you should look for something a bit larger. I had to creativly place my camera sideways in order to fit everything in this bag. The zipper is incredibly annoying as the lip of the cover is covering it, if you are looking for a 1-handed operation, forget it."
4,Just as many said,The bag is only big enough to fit my Nikon with one lens attached when the dividers are taken out. You can also fit a couple of other small items in the side pockets. There is a small flap that has to be lifted in order to unzip and is a bit annoying but is managable. Overall it is a good bag for someone who doesn't want to bring many items to go out and shoot.
5,VERY PLEASED!,I was very pleased with this camera bag. I bought it as new. It was every thing I wanted in a bag. A lot of product for the money. I was pleased with the seller. They packaged it very well and shipped it right away.
3,Opteka Microfiber Camera Bag,"I bought this bag for my canon 450D. The bag is high quality and well constructed..but very small! I have 3 filters, the camera with 18-55mm kit lens attached, a few memory cards and batteries and the camera manual, and it's a squeeze to get everything into it. It is also not very 'professional looking' if you want a professional image. I'd recommend getting the canon 2400 bag."
3,Don't use the yellow cloth whatever you do...,The price is worth it for the camera bag but DO NOT use the yellow cloth...it left fuzz all over my lens. The tripod is a joke...check the size...it doesn't even hold my camera up with the lens on.
5,great value,"I was unhappy with the shipping ....But the product overall is great ... i am using this bage for a ""bridge camera"" and it fits just right. II would not buy this case for a full SLR camera as it would not be big enough ... but for a nice upgraded point and shoot with a large body and a few attachments it is perfect. protects everything well."
3,Not much professional,"The bag overall serves good, but not much professional in its look and design. I will suggest to go for a Sony or Canon bags. I am ok coz I got this in a god deal and serves the purpose."
4,Great item for the price!,"The bag is fairly high quality, and for the price, you really cannot beat it. I am more than happy with my purchase - and the cleaning kit and tripod are just a little added bonus. I have actually recommended this item to family members as well."
3,"Nice, but small","I bought this for my new Samsung GX-10. Works fine for the body and kit lens and other small accessories, but is too small to comfortably fit my zoom lens as well. Good construction and textures, but should have gone bigger."
5,An excellent choice,"Very practical, roomy, but not oversized camera bag. It has lots of usable pockets. Well-made, weather resistant, holds a lot of stuff. I kept a camera, a cell phones, a spare batteries and a charger in this bag (along with other small items) during my recent vacation, and was very satisfied. Well worth the price. Would recommend.Thanks."
4,Nice bag for one SLR camera and 1 lens,"It's a nice bag of good quality. You can fit your one SLR camera and one lens and few small accessories.If you have many other accessories like external flash, additional lens then you should get a bigger one."
4,Small but solid and funcitonal,"Good solid bag for the money. Nearly waterproof. Strong nylon. Good internal pocket flexibility. Rather small for DLS and two lenses, but that is what I wanted, i.e., a small bag. Tripod is very, very small and probably will not be very useful...though it does work....and might fit for some unusual circumstance. Cleaning kit is good too. Would recommend it....especially considering the price/value equation."
3,Not roomy.,"The construction of this bag is out of sight. Great value. Lots and lots of pockets.HOWEVER, my Canon 40D with its zoom attached and the second lens I have, barely fit in this bag.They do fit, which makes it a great small on the go bag. When I add another lens or a flash, I will have to get another bag."
3,Not Big Enough For SLR,"The seller was prompt and the item itself is a great bag with good quality. The only problem is, it's barely big enough for my Nikon D70, and can't seem to fit my zoom lens or any other accessories. I bought the bag under the impression that this bag is ""professional."" If you have a SLR and have a zoom lens, don't get this bag."
4,Camera Bag,"This bag has been the perfect solution for carrying camera, spare lenses etc. It is easy to carry and is accessible."
2,This bag is useless.,After a few months the zipper failed. It was kind of an awkward camera bag to begin with. It didn't fit my camera and two lenses well and that's a shame.
4,Its a bag - it kinda does what is suppose to do just by that,Samsonite is a quality name and this bag is no exception to the name. The bag has plenty of pockets and is padded well inside along with a very secure detachable strap and padded handle. It is a moderate size good enough for a camcorder and a digital camera. The supplied tripod is a little goofy and can be unstable but it gets the job done and the cleaning kit I never bothered to use because if you rely on a freebie to clean you expensive equipment then you would never of bought the bag to protect that equipment in the first place.
2,"Wrong apps, and some are already free..","Mine doesn't contain the apps listed in the description. Furthermore, a little research turned up that some of these games, including Tyranny (Mobile Generation Software) are freeware and readily available on the web."
5,Love these gloves.,"I was a bit reluctant to give these gloves a five star rating, but to my surprise they have out preformed even my expectations. I got these right before Sandy hit the East coast, needless to say there was an over whelming amount of clean-up to be done.These gloves kept my hands safe from harm the entire time. Using chain-saw, picking up tree branches,raking and burning of debris in my outdoor fire pit. Love these gloves."
3,"Good gloves, but sized for women.","I ordered the XX large gloves, knowing I have fairly large hands. When they arrived they look great and have decent padding for the knuckles and fingers. Once I tried them on, I could barly make a fist in them. i.e. close for a tight grip on wrenches or the like. Oder one size larger than you need if you want them to be comfortable."
3,Good quality at an affordable price. Size is unusual.,I have an injured 2nd knuckle and I use gloves for most activities. Every other glove I own is size 9-1/2 but these I had to buy XL or the fingers would be too short. The palm is too wide but it still comfortable. For people with wider hands the fit would probably be better. All in all I'm happy with this purchase.
1,Didn't last long...,These lasted 2 weeks. Very expensive for 14 days of use.I would not recommend these. Go with the Mechanix brand.
4,Mechanix M-Pact II - Grip & Protection,"Pros: -If your hands are at risk being cut, slammed, pinched, and so on, these gloves will give you a little relief knowing that they will take a beating.Notes:- Not good for spending hours in low temperatures- Not tight fitting, but not too loose either- Large profile with knuckle protection and material on the back of fingers, makes difficult to fit into tight spaces such as pockets or small trigger guards.-They also can give an improved grip on objects, although there are probably better gloves out there for grip."
3,No size chart,Good glove but lack of size chart Got wrong size but at least old lady can wear them . Go a size bigger
3,Expected them to last!!!,"I purchased these gloves hoping they would last more than a month. I drive hi-lo for work and have went through several gloves, but 2 weeks in the stitching has already came apart on the left glove and there is a big hole in them already. so much for good gloves. other than that they were great gloves. still looking for a great pair of driving gloves:("
5,Good news,We are dog sport people and these gloves suggested by Lickty Splits turned out to be the best gloves we have used and we highly recommend them.
3,"OOH-rah! Long on Esprit de corps, short on substance","Low-cal brain candy for those few of us addicted to all things Marine (Semper Fi!)and science fiction. Some humorous moments, Corps stereotypes abound, but the combat is what you'd expect from a nation raised on Platoon and Born on the fourth of July conciousness. A distracting, enjoyable exercise in not thinking too hard. Both of the sequels seem to run along the same vein."
5,One of the best sci-fi books I have ever read.,"When I got this book I wasn't sure I would like it. However, once I started to read it I couldn't put it down. Some of the technology in it confused me, but I usually got to understand it. A few times it did get a little confusing, but when I read further everthing became clear. I can't wait for the rest of the trilogy to come out."
2,For Marines only.,"I've read the first 6 books starting with ""Semper Mars"", when I got 1/2 way through book 6 I became fed up with Mr. Douglas trashing the U.S.Army. To read this guys books you would think all of Americas armed forces where a bunch of lazy, stupid slackers, this guy was not even a Marine... Freaking squid. I'm sending the books of his I bought to the U.S.O and maybe when they get to the sandbox a soldier will take the time to read the books to a Marine."
4,Great book,"I'm mad at my friend for getting me hooked to this book.Great sci-fi, very patriotic. It may turn you against the UN"
4,Jar Heads to the Rescue,"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I thought the battle scenes in space and on Mars explored many of the problems related to fighting in space. And the book brought home the age old adage that ""No one attacks a strog America."" There is a warning in this book as well regarding US/UN relations.Semper Fi everyone and thank God for the USMC."
1,"A crude, tasteless start","Full disclosure: I only read up to page 33. This might disqualify me as a reviewer. On the other hand, I can't think of the last time I stopped reading a book this quickly, even a terrible one. What's more, the jingoistic U-S-A tone of the book is actually a nice attraction for me. So what's the problem? First, lame and stereotypical dialogue. Second, a crude and tasteless sex scene. It's tough to turn me off with a sex scene, but this one managed it in spades. I recommend skipping this series and going straight to Jack Campbell's Dauntless series. Besides its other merits, Campbell's series has a great opening that gets you into the action right away."
4,Very cool story concept,"I absolutely loved the idea behind this story. Advanced alien civilization leaves artifacts on Mars? And might have had a hand in our evolution? Really cool stuff.I would have given this book 5 stars, but I found the book too slow in several sections, with details that either could have been left out, or greatly summarized.That said, I still enjoyed the book, I just resulted to skimming in some places.The second book is even better!I've read Ian Douglas's Star Carrier series and thoroughly enjoyed them. Overall, he's a really great writer, but I'm an impatient Gen X'er. No fault of Douglas's."
4,exciting if not deep,"Read the book upon recommendation of bookseller. Would not otherwise have touched the novel. Although it is very politically charged, it is a very exciting read. The combat is mediocre, but well paced to keep the story moving. The characters are interesitng, if a tad shallow. The backdrop however, seems well developed. If you like taking today's problems and putting them in a near future setting, this book is for you."
5,The best in an underrepresented genre,"This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. For anyone interested in a possible future of war and humankind read this book. It may not be the most technically accurate book available, but its definitely one of the most entertaining!"
3,Good but not great,I don't regret reading this book but when some asks me to recommend a book to read this would not be the book I would recommend.
4,The author MUST be a combat-tested Marine,"I find it difficult to give five stars to any book, but if 4.9 had been available , this one would have received it. The mixture of combat action and the dangers of vacuum make this a real winner. The character were well developed and believable. The attention to detail brought the story to life."
3,A good read,"Despite the three stars, I loved this book and the series. I purchased the book purely due to nostolgia, having first read it when I was in my late teens. It is fast paced and well written but believe it to be too scattered with multiple characters, where it can be confusing who the main character is. Still, it was a good read."
4,Bad Title - Good Book,"Great reading. Don't get the title, I think it translates as ""Always Mars"". The title kept me from reading it for over a year, thinking the author was an idiot. But it turned out to be a good read. I'm halfway through the 2nd in the trilogyLuna Marine (The Heritage Trilogy, Book 2)and am enjoying it as well. I'm sure I'll read the third and may continue on with the authors other series of the same genre. Anyway, of you like the military sci-fi you'll likely enjoy this."
2,"Interesting. Not high art, mind you, but interesting.","As a former U.S. Marine, I found Mr Douglas' book inteesting. This story made a nice afternoon read. It is painfully apparent, though that Mr Douglas didn't reasearch his characters very well. Officers and enlisted Marines simply don't talk the way they were depicted in this book"
4,Semper Mars HOORAH!,"Good action shoot-em up! Lots of background, very realistic. Good fiction writing about the CORPS in the future! Not quite a must-read but darn near to it!"
1,This book is terrible,"The premise sounds cool but this book is simply boring, unrealistic and hung up on insignificant detail. When it's not doing that the writer is going on about his love affair for the marine corps. It's possible that the sequels focus on the interesting part of the story (another civilisation on mars) but I'll never know."
3,Semper Mars: Book One of the Heritage Trilogy,"Is this writer for the American market or the Mormon community? Either way, he has lost me via my own sense of right and wrong. I ended up giving this book away to a Mormon acquaintance who says he's into ""war stuff"". I'm sure it would fit his temperment and culture better than mine. The adventure lacked the excitement I crave in adventure stories, especially war; but worse, I could not identify with the lead character. Nor could I feel for him or anyone else in the story. I don't believe the failure was in character development as it was in developing a likable character. Great ideas though, so it may get better in his later books."
3,Whatever,Too much detail slows down the story. I wonder if Sir Isaac Newton knows about a rifle bullet that goes so fast that it hits the target before the rifle recoils? (Third law of motion)
3,Written by a firebug,"This book was written by a convicted firebug, who was a fire inspector for the Glendale, California, Fire Department. The manuscript was found in his belongings after he was apprehended, during a search of his home, on a search warrant.The story was on the A&E; Channel, describing many of the fires he set. Some were in buildings, and in one, children died. Not a paragon of virtue. Although the book is supposed to be fiction, it is patterned after actual facts as only he knew the details. He often astounded members of his department with his deductions on how the fires started; but he was not brilliant. He had first hand knowledge.The proceeds of the sale go to remuneration of the damages his victims suffered, as is common on books by criminals. A book by Joseph Wambaugh is a good companion to this one, if you want to look into a sick mind.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"
2,Arsonist Arsonist Arsonist !,"John Leonard Orr is/was a classic example of an arsonist. This guy is/was a power hungry individual, who had a little mans complex for many years. He'd do ANYTHING for attention. Due to his short comings in life he went through numerous marriages, friendships and relationships. I've read the actual manuscript seized during the search warrant of his Eagle Rock home. It matches almost line for line what occurred at fires that were started in Glendale and some that were many miles away from where he lived. Coincidence?????? I think not.....I KNOW he committed more arson fires he was never charged with nor convicted of.......I know of one other individual that he convicted for arson fires that he (Orr) committed. I would not give Orr the satisfaction of buying nor reading this ""ficticious"" piece. The Wambaugh book, which I have read, is a better read even though it is based solely on court testimony and other documents."
1,Buy the Wambaugh book instead.,"As can be understood from the Joseph Wambaugh book ""Fire Lover,"" this book is essentially a journal of the pyromaniac and murderer, John Orr. It includes a arsonist act of a large hardware store that killed a toddler and his grandmother. As the former book discusses, this was the actual event of Los Angeles fire that left a boy, grandmother, and others dead. The author, John Orr, is the culprit. I read the Wambaugh book, but I have not read the convicted killer's book. I have no intention of giving him the satisfaction of buying the book. I hope that he reads this review. I would like for him to know that while I am not a proponent of the death penalty, I do believe that he is one who would deserve it."
5,Good videos and bonus concert footage!,Videos include...Arte De La Calle - Feat. DomingoSi No Hay Pa'Mi No Hay Pa'TiPana Pana - Feat. DomingoArte De La Calle REMIX - Feat. DomingoDesahogo Del Alma - Feat. DomingoYo No SePlus 20 minutes of Don Dinero performing LIVE in concert.
5,I like the fairlight!!,"It's a great album. I hate Shopping and Hit Music. But the rest of the album is magic. Contrary to the other review, ""Always On My Mind"" is not on this one. It was released on a special CD or LP at Christmas on the year this LP was released. Those special releases have long since been deleted. You can maybe find one if you are lucky (as I was)."
5,One of the best!,"Until I came across this album by accident in a friend's music collection in '88 or '89,I was a casual Pet Shop Boys fan.Since then,everybody that I know knows how much of a fan I am!I think this album will always be my favorite,partly because it was my first,but mostly because it's a damn fine collection of songs!I'd have to say that one of the songs that is not a single is my favorite.""It Couldn't Happen Here"" is one of the most beautiful songs ever!This isn't to say that every other song isn't great too though.You pretty much can't go wrong!I absolutely recomend this album to the new fan,old fan or anyone in between!"
5,Brilliant!,"Actually is a wonderful record. A true example of art from the cover to the music. Today, it is still one of my most favorite records from PSB."
3,Actually by the Pet Shop Boys,"I bought this CD for the single ""It's a SIN"" and to my surprise the other selections are not bad either. This CD is 10 times better than Guilty."
4,"""Pickly""...and british...","In a lot of ways, Pet Shop Boys oldest music is their best, and most powerful and meaningful. Most of the songs on this CD typify these things, but there are also songs, that I don't care for and aren't as memorable. I rate this about an average PSB album; not one of their best, but rather, one of their better ones."
5,FUN FUN FUN,"This Pet Shop Boys LP is sheer fun fun fun! The stand-out is their inspired pairing with Dusty Springfield (one of the most gifted vocalists of this era) on ""What Have I Done To Deserve This?""Other stand-outs...""Rent"" and ""I Want To Wake Up""The Pet Shop Boys can do dance music like no one else."
4,Desde Uruguay,Desde la tierra natal de Los Iracundos puedo afirmar que este CD contiene sus mejores canciones. Con esa sencillez que es su característica llena de emoción el escucharlos.
4,Funny book good,Very witty a laugh a line for sure like other swartzwelder titles very reminiscent of classic simpsons episodes will read it again and again!!!!
3,Not bad but not the best,"The premise of this story seemed like it would be great for Burly but it just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the read, but I feel that some of Swartzwelder's other works, such as Dead Men Scare Me Stupid and Double Wonderful, were better. For one thing, I didn't laugh much until around chapter 10, which isn't great considering there's only 17. Secondly, Burly was less consistent in this story than in the others I've read so far. If Burly is NOT smart to avoid the trouble he gets himself in how can he have the intelligence to escape from prison and aid the 'Earthmen' in retaking the planet the way he did? Overall, it was another fun Burly adventure, but not the best, and as I've said in other reviews paying double for a third of a book is not for everybody; rent/borrow this one if you can."
3,"Good, but not great.","The book is funny, but it is not as hilarious as an episode of the Simpsons.Still, not bad."
4,Frank Burly goes above and beyond,"You don't need to have read The Time Machine Did It before you read this one, but I think it would help. This book seems to start out assuming that you already have some idea what kind of man Frank Burly is (although he's not very complicated. So it's not hard to figure out).It feels like Swartzwelder took a look at his first book, one of the most over-the-top insane comedies I've ever read and thought, ""How can I make it crazier?"" And I don't know how, but he manages to do it.If you really enjoyed his first book, then you will love this one. If you found yourself getting rather tired of Frank Burly by the end of the first book, which seems to be a reaction that many people have, I wouldn't pick this one up. Because it only gets Burly-er."
4,Politics as Usual,"After reading ""America Afire"" by Bernard A Weisberger, I understand just how smoothly the last two Presidential elections here in America went. I can't even begin to imagine Rush Limbaugh's take on the campaign of 1800. Of course he couldn't have done job back than, because he would have been arrested under the sedition acts.The election of 1800 which gave us Thomas Jefferson as our third President was truly the first of its kind. A truly contested office with more than one National party and plenty of back room deals. It was also the blueprint for what our forms of governmental elections have become. In this book you will learn to appreciate a few hanging chads in Florida and some uncounted absentee ballots in Ohio. Perhaps the most importation lesson that can be learned from to great men [Jefferson and Adams], is that you can have truly differing belies in how best to govern our country, be political enemies and yet still stay life long friends."
5,"Live Long, Eat and Read Grub",This is one of the best books written on the topic. I was not a big fan of healthy eating until now. The recipes and insight in this book make organic cooking enjoyable and feasible even with a busy lifestyle.The equation is easy: Buy Grub + Read Grub x Eat Good Grub= Feel Better and Live longer.
4,Transforming to an Organic Kitchen,"Wonderful ideas for changing to an organic kitchen. The suggestions, resources, and ideas for fresh food is amazing. Now I have a clear plan on making changes to my family meals. Like two books in one...uncovering the food conspiracy and seasonal recipes. There are a few things that are far out for this meat and pototoes girl but I totally understand the concepts."
4,Interesting!,"I'm only a few chapters into the book and though most of the information I've heard before, I like the style of the writer. I also like the suggestions provided. Too often we are told that particular habits are bad, but no practical solution is provided. I'm looking forward to the recipes!"
5,Healthy Urban Cooking,This book was a gift for a couple who live in a huge city and want to cook healthy meals. Feedback is that they love the book and are cooking their way through it. I am going to buy one for myself.
2,Not Worth It,"To save yourself from taking the time to read the book, I'll sum it up. Pesticides= Bad. Buy local, eat organic=Good. The part about setting up a kitchen for those who don't cook was almost humorous. It was written by someone who doesn't cook much. It then prepared you to expect the rest of the book to have simple meals that new cooks could do. That wasn't the case. The recipes look good. I haven't tried any yet, but I was hoping to learn something more not buy a cookbook. I decided the only thing ""urban"" about the kitchen was access to the unusual ingredients that many of the recipes had."
5,Inspired!,"There are a lot of things that I love about this book. First, the authors use humor to present some really serious news, simplifying a set of complex factors that have led to our very broken food ""industry"". Second, they artfully show the intersection of the health, environmental and social justice issues that play out in food production and food choices. Third, they remind us that eating healthfully doesn't mean we're limited to tofu veggie stir fries and rice cakes every day of the week. Finally, Grub is really accessible, and is a perfect tool for educating friends and family members about these issues without worrying about offending anyone by saying the wrong thing at the wrong moment.I already consider myself a healthy eater - but after reading Grub, I feel so much more inspired to make thoughtful choices, buy from my local farmers market and have more fun creating beautiful, delicious and healthy meals. Just in time for summer!"
4,Only one complaint,"First of all, I would like to say that I simply adore the recipes in this book. I do consider most of them to be ""special occasion"" food, since I can't always afford some of the ingredients, but it's good to have fancy food every now and then.My only complaint with this book is that the authors seem to show contempt for anyone who follows a specific lifestyle or diet. As a dedicated vegan myself, I choose not to eat animal products as part of my effort to not support the meat industry or the suffering of other living things. So, when the authors gave examples of ""vegans"" sneaking cheese, or ""vegetarians"" sneaking seafood, that seems unfair. Obviously these ""vegans"" and ""vegetarians"" are not in fact what they say they are. That doesn't mean that every veg-head out there is a hypocrite who's to weak to ""do without"".If the book didn't have that snide little comment, I'd give it 5 stars. But buy it for the recipes anyways!! Yum!"
2,Delivered in incredibly bad shape,"The tube holding the rods was completely broken - I should not be paying for damaged goods. Additionally, flux had broken off and was dusting everywhere."
4,Good all around strings,"Keeping in mind the difference types of guitars and pickups, these D'Addario strings are good strings for all around use. They are suitable for rock, punk, country, and funk. Sure, you could spend more on ""boutique"" specialty strings to give you that exact ""vintage"" sound, but these strings are just fine whether you play in the bedroom, garage or club.I like the light guage .010's because they are easy on the fingers, but are still beefy sounding compared to thin sounding .009's and .008's."
5,A great gauge for larger frets,"My Strat has bigger frets than any guitar I have ever owned, and I have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges, particularly on the 3rd string. This 11 to 49 set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure, while still feeling ""faster"" than an acoustic guitar. They sound great, last a long time, stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets."
2,Visibly corroded,"Having used D'Addario happily (as well as other brands) over the years, I felt a bit pissed off when, several weeks after purchasing these, I opened them and saw that they had a lot of corrosion.I like the enviromentally friendly packaging, but it may have not worked this time. Or else they may need some QC."
5,My preference,"I've been playing guitar, (Classic Rock, Country, and Bluegrass), both professionally and at home for pleasure, for forty years. I've used many brands and types of guitar strings but I've landed on D'Addarios for the last five years.D'Addarios are bright, unflawed, and they last a long time. Nowadays I go for quite long periods between playing my guitars and, even after many weeks, I pick up the guitar and the D'Addarios are still in perfect tune and they yield a robust response.The guitars that I play are hand-made copies of Fender Stratacasters, made by a craftsman who is a friend. He too uses D'Addarios although his situation is different from my own -- he's a pro who plays multiple times per week and has done so for over forty years. He plays Strats, Telecasters, and Gibson Les Pauls. So these strings are versatile enough to use on any electric guitar and still perform nicely.There's no guitar string which I could recommend more highly."
5,Bang for your buck!,"Strings are color coded, which can be a blessing for new guitarist. If you take good care of them, you can limit how often you need to change your strings. I would certainly recommend."
5,What I use...,"Semi-pro player, these are consistently a good string that lasts reasonably well.Enuff said. Six more words are required (that's enough)."
4,"Nice quality, great price.",These worked out fine. They're your average guitar strings. Good quality sound. They are easy to tune and play well. For the price you really can't beat the quality. I recommend.
5,The only string I ever use!,I've tried them all. This is what use every time. Why would I use anything else? A string is a string. Use what you like.
5,EXL140 strings,"Tone for days. You get more tone from a fatter string. But thicker strings are harder to bend. This set is the best of both worlds in that the higher strings you are more likely to bend are thinner, and the lower three are thicker. Very close to Stevie Ray Vaughn's gauges (whom we all know has great tone)."
5,D'Addario guitar strings,Great price on a very good product. It's like getting 6 free sets compared to prices in Alberta.
4,A good all around string set,"These play, hold tune and last well. If they could play on their own they would be perfect! Good choice for the Strats I have put them on."
5,Top Quality. Best deal in town!,D'Addario guitar strings are always of top quality and I can count on that with each purchase. The price is always the best when compared to other music retailers when bought in quantities. I have recommended these guitar strings to friends and will continue to do so.
5,Great strings at a great price!,"I have used these strings exclusively for a while now, and I'm very satisfied with their performance and durability. Highly recommended!"
5,Love these strings,"This bundle will save you soooo much money. And if you're an artist, you need to save as much money as possible."
4,"Great Strings, great price...","I have been playing guitar for a little over 10 years and I really love these strings. I have tried brands such as GHS, Ernie Ball, Dr, and more, but these seem to have one of the best feel. They have a real clarity in tone and are a great match especially for someone starting out playing, it will help their fingers not bleed as much because of the feel. The only brand that I think is a bit better is Dean Markley Blue Steels. They last longer, are brighter, and I am liking the feel a bit better as well. None the less, for the price and over all value, these strings are awesome, and even in my house, you will find a dozen sets ready to string up!"
5,The best strings I have used,"After trying many different brands and types of strings over a few years, I always come back to (and now exclusively use) D'Addarios. They last longer, stay in tune better, and overall are high quality strings. I've used Ernie Ball Slinkys, DR, and other brands, but found myself breaking strings regularly. These strings rarely break, and I change them half as often.Features that make these stand out:-The packaging is good. Minimal waste compared to some brands, and the corrosion resistant bags mean I can store extra sets in my guitar case and know they'll be fresh when I need them.-The color-coded ball ends are a nice touch, making string changes faster.-Usually available in discounted multi-packs. I've found the best deal can usually be found ordering 10 packs."
5,Great strings,I love the clarity and punch I get with these. They're great with a variety of pickups. Highly recommended!
4,"Not the Ultimate, but Good and Consistent.","The D'Addario EXL110's are my go-to strings. Here's why:The're easy to find, wherever you are.The quality is consistent, pack after pack.The color coding on the ball ends makes for easy & quick string ID, once you memorize it.Really, there's not a lot of writing to do about guitar strings, so I will leave it at this; D'Addario strings may not be the absolute top of the line, ""bells & whistles"" strings out there, but they don't cost as much, and they perform consistently, and with a high enough quality that I know I can always depend on them."
4,Great!,Did exactly what it said on the tin. Did exactly what it said on the tin. four more words um...
4,Good buy on strings,"I haven't actually used these strings. I actually bought them to use 'down the road.' Currently, I have a small supply of strings, but I wanted to add to my backstock. I have used this brand of strings before and I find these are very good bargain. I think I should have bought more."
2,Not the best,"I have played on D'addario Before, actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok, but can wear out real fast, So, It's importent not to put to much stess on them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's, etc they will break. Any skilled guitarist know's to use extream caution when tuning....any strings,I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them) I would not recamend these for beginer's, cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.Personally, I don't like D'addario's at all, I find the tone to bright."
2,Bad apple?,"I've probably gone through 6 sets of d'addario strings on my tele. Keep in mind the negative reviewers are probably a little more vocal than the positive ones. :PI had an old set of 11-52's on my guitar for almost two years, I decided it was time to change them just because they were so dull sounding. I keep my tele tuned to Eb instead of E, so the strings aren't tensioned as tight as they might be. I put these new 12-54's on and the high e (e flat actually) string broke within 5 minutes of playing. I was doing a full step bend, not incredibly stressful for the string. Not cool. Like I say I've never had a problem before though, so it could just be an anomaly.One little thing that has changed is the end spool things. I think they used to be anodised, now they are painted. It really doesn't matter since nobody sees them but they aren't as pretty."
1,I got ripped off,"I only use 115's for my electrics, no problem with the strings. I paid for 11 packs got 10. I told Amazon, great instant reply with promise of missing pack to be shipped. Instead of 1 pack of 115's I received 10 packs of 110's. Not wanting something I did not pay for, and an incorrect product, I sent the 10 packs back and received no credit to my account. O.K. it is only 3 bucks but still, You stole 3$ from me."
4,best strings for floating tremolo,"I think that d'addario are the best strings for floating tremolo, I've not had any problem with stay in tune, even my guitar (for many people) has a cheap copy of license floyd rose tremolo. I've tried many brands but these seems to be the most stable strings for floating tremolo, and for the price you always wins."
5,Good quality/price ratio,"The strings worked just fine. There are a little lighter than I thougth, but work great. Good quality for the price!."
3,the strings where alright,the strings broke pretty fast but it was still ok they sounded alright and before they broke they sounded good
4,Industry Standard,"I have these strings to my husband, a professional musician, to test out. It is a great, solid string, an industry standard. These are a great deal through Amazon."
3,Thin sounding E,"I'm not trying to bash these strings. Every note on my Fender Strat American sounds great except the open E. I tried the second pack of my 3 pack and it sounded the same after being broken in. It just sounds thin is the best way I can describe it. My old strings didn't sound like that. I don't know how to describe it, but it rubs me the wrong way. If anyone can direct me to strings that don't do that, I would be appreciative. Otherwise, I like the strings and they have kept their life for a while."
5,D'Awesome,"Great strings. Very durable and long lasting. Since I've switched I haven't had broken a G, B, or e string while playing. 5/5."
5,Can't go wrong with D'Addario,Great string for a great price. The string tension provided by these sets on a 24.5 inch scale to standard tuning is ideal in my opinion!
5,"D'Adarrio EXL140-3D Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light Top/Heavy Bottom","I love D'Adarrio strings. Great tone and it last long, feels great on your fingers. D'Adarrio strings rule. See ya!"
2,Only 2 for the price of 3,"The strings are great but I gave this rating because when I bought the 3 pack of strings in one of the packs one of the strings was to short, so I really only got 2 sets that I can use....."
5,Nice strings,"Great strings at a great price. I've used this brand for years and feel they give me good tone, nice feel, and long life. Very good choice for rock or country pickers."
5,Speedy and great,"I received this in a very short amount of time and the sound quality is awesome thanks alot, i also like the option to be able to ship them on a regular basis A+.Thanks Again"
4,The sweet sound of music...,"I replaced the factory strings on myDean Playmate Avalanche Junior Solid Body Electric Guitar, Metallic Silver, 3/4 Sizeand what a difference in sound. These strings seriously rock. I also use D'Addario strings on my ukulele and I've had great luck with those. They withstand a lot of play and I don't have to replace them often. The best part is, the sound is so much brighter and louder. Definitely recommended."
4,Very nice sound,"These strings give a very nice sound on my son's electric guitar. It took regular tuning adjustments for about a week for them to settle in but after that they just sounded nice. He plays acoustic guitar more often, but if he goes through strings on the electric one as often as his acoustic strings break, this brand has a nice sound at a decent price."
4,"Hi-Ho, D'Addario!","I have been using D'Addario electric guitar strings since the late 1970s after years of using Ernie Ball, Gibson, and Fender strings. I still buy the other brands for my electrics on occasion, but the D'Addario XL 10-46 ga. are the standards for my Fender Strats and Tele. I like that the unwound G is a .017 rather than the more common (and lighter) .016 on similar regular light sets. The strings also seem to be louder, at least initially, and last a while longer than some of the other brands. They are my old standby for guitar strings across the board, and interestingly, they often cost much less than some of the other brands. Good product at a great price!"
5,D'addario exl 10 pack 10 - 46 guage guitar strings,"This is a great value pack of the most popular gauge of electric guitar string.Performance, quality at a great price delivered seamlessly by Amazon."
5,Guitar strings,These strings sound great they are easy to bend to the next full note. Great value when you buy ten at a time.
5,Great set of strings - with history,"I have been playing guitar for three decades and It seems to me that D'Addario has been around.I use light strings when I want more control and easier bends for blues songs on my electric guitar. Light strings in my hands do seem to wear out sooner, probably because I used them in this manner. It is great that Amazon stocks these, making ordering convenient. These come in a stay fresh vacuum pack, so ordering more than one and keeping an extra set around is prudent."
5,we love them,"We use D'Addario strings on multiple instruments, have always been pleased, they sell at many price points; we have yet to be disappointed. These exl110 strings sound good and last a long time, feel good on the fingers."
5,"Full, thick sound",I bought these to put on my Epiphone Sheraton II. I really like the thickness of the strings and the full tone they offer. Rhythm and lead styles both sound great. Definitely recommend these strings and will buy more in the future.
4,Excellent Basic Electric Guitar Strings,"For a good, basic set of regular light gauge electric guitar strings, it's difficult to go wrong with D'Addario's EXL110s. The range of thicknesses generally works well, and D'Addarios tend to be pretty consistent. Some other brands may offer special features that go beyond what you get with the EXL110s (e.g. coating, super brightness, and so on), and some players prefer a slightly heavier or slightly lighter gauge string (e.g. sets that start with 9s or 11s), but for most purposes these work great, hold their tuning well, and seem to last pretty well, too."
5,Nice strings,"First time using this brand of guitar strings. Very happy with them. They have a nice tone, are of good quality. Packaging is environmentally friendly, which is a plus. Will buy again."
3,"Best Strings Available "" Until I Played DR Strings""","D'Addario Are The Best Strings That I Have Tried, I Used To Use Ernie Ball Super Slinky's But Found That These Last Longer, The Ernie's Bend and Play Well But They Tend To Go Dull Faster Not To Mention The Ernie's Start Corroding Within A Week, These D'Addario Strings Stay Brighter Longer, I Usually Change Them About Every 4 Weeks, The Ernie's Only Last Me A Week, 2 Weeks At The Most, That Can Get Expensive Fast, All Around The D'Addario Strings Are The Strings 4 Me, Retraction, when I originally wrote this review I thought they were the best, Turns out they are in fact way better than Ernie Ball Strings, but they are no longer my preference, A friend of mine told me about DR strings and they are much better than these D'Addarios. DR's last three times as long as D'Addario. the DR's cost a lil more but they are way better, for the money Addarios are good but I would recommend spending a few dollars more for DR strings"
4,They're D'Addario - What Else Can You Say?,"I find D'Addario to be the best short term brand of strings. You put them on and they're great for a day or two, but any longer than that and they begin to rust and degrade a bit, and after a couple weeks they're nearly unplayable. But for those first couple days, they're awesome. That's why many of the biggest touring acts put a new set on before every show - they're the best sounding strings around. And as a final note: you really can't beat the price tag."
5,"Great Purchase, recommend to everybody!","I just got through with fitting the strings and they sound a lot better than my last set of strings, no troubles whatsoever, they didn't break when I was fitting them either. If you are new or even experienced with guitar and trying to figure out what kind of strings you should get, then these would probably be your best bet. Great tones, smoothe strings that don't grind your fingertips, and really strong material for the weekend sessions."
5,Best way to buy the best strings,"I've played electric guitar since 1968. For about 20 years now I've used the EXL 140s exclusively, but can't always find them in a store, and always get dunned for high prices. Now I just go to Amazon and buy this excellent 10 pack which always shows up in my mailbox in a few days and works out to about $3.50 a set. KILLER!"
3,NOT FOR ACOUSTIC,I love D'Addario and these came up under 'acoustic strings' I should have read more closely. At least they were pretty cheap
3,Happy to have it for the good tracks,"Sweet Little Sixteen is awful, but the other Spector tracks are pretty good, even with that weird attenuated sound. Otherwise Ya Ya swings pretty good and Do You Wanna Dance? is an effective arrangement. There are some very ineffective arrangements as well, though, particularly the Little Richard numbers and Ain't That a Shame. And it's no surprise that To Know Her is to Love Her got left out once you hear it. It doesn't come close to the version Lennon was singing on the BBC circa 1963. I wish Lennon would have gone with more obscure tunes and less horns and studio gee whiz."
5,"Sometimes, it's just rock n roll","A great rock musician playing some of the great early rock n roll tunes -- Lennon's version of Slippin' and Slidin' absolutely kicks. For the pure joy of rock n roll, the bounce, the shout and the growl, this album is unbeatable. Shut up and dance."
3,Want to love it but can't,Part of my love for the Beatles was their ability to do incredible covers of some of their favorite songs. I was hoping for the same on this CD but most of the songs covered on this CD are covered poorly. Other then a few god tracks most of these songs all sound the same. I think they tried too hard to make these sound different then the originals and ruined them. It also seems like they left the guitar out of many of these songs and added horns instead
2,A turgid mess,"John Lennon revisiting the rock-and-roll gems of his youth? Sounds great, until you actually hear the results. Aside from the first cut, a snappy version of Gene Vincent's ""Be-Bop-A-Lula"" (which Paul McCartney also covered on ""Unplugged""), the whole thing is a soggy, bludgeoning mess. Phil Spector, who Lennon brought in to produce, left after completing only four tracks. Alas, Lennon chose to adopt Spector's elephantine production style, dangerous enough in the hands of its inventor and pure poison in anybody else's. It's a pity. Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Chuck Berry--they all got the red-carpet treatment from the Beatles, who not infrequently matched or surpassed their original inspirations. Here you find Lennon paddling clumsily in the wake of his heroes. Even his off-the-cuff version of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" on ""Live Peace in Toronto,"" hastily rehearsed during a transatlantic plane flight (!), puts this recording to shame."
5,"A raw, original and emotional summary of original rock&roll",It has been many years since I first heard this album. An nearly as many years since I saw the cassette I had it recorded on destroying itself spontaneously. Never have I been able to find the album again in the regular musicstores. So I'm very happy to be able to buy this underestimated album again. It makes me recall happy days in the seventies when we were young and discovering the world. Thank you John!
4,"oh, what could have been","By the time this album finally came out, I was used to being disappointed with Lennon releases. The spectacular sound and craft of the Beatles was a thing of the past, and I had to get used to Lennon's muddy and amatuer sounding production style. This album could have been great, one listen to the outtakes and alternate takes on Anthology confirms that. But instead we get this garbage can sound. How could anyone ever tell how good the band or the singer really is through this muck? Still gets four stars because even with a smelly production, it's still John singing the songs of his youth, and it's all we'll ever get. I know Capital will never do it because it would sound so radically different, but going back to the original 16 track multitracks and doing a fresh mix would make this album a classic, trust me."
3,"Amazing songs, awful sound","Recorded in his lost weekend in NY and LA during 1975, Rock n roll is a great record, but very, very bad recorded. I dont know if it is a monaural one as Imagine was, but this one sounds really awful even for a CD. Incredible 50s and 60 versions, anyway."
2,lennonless,bought this wwhen it came out- the only song I remember is Stand by me and even that is medicore. Just like Dylans crappy late 80s early 90s output there will be tons of Lennon fans saying this is an overlooked masterpiece- like those if it wasnt for his star power nobody would have listened to it and he probably would never be offered another album. skip it unless your a hardcore Lennonite.
2,Beneath him,"Only ""Stand By Me"" is worth having. The rest are forgettable and perhaps even regrettable. John's performance is perfunctory; Spector's production is awful [is that a sax or a kazoo?]; the arrangements add nothing; though there are some good musicians credited, the playing is unimaginative.I don't even think the concept was worthwhile. He would have been better advised to work a couple of these moldy-oldies into albums of original material.I *am* a die-hard Lennon fan, but would rather this project had been left in the can.Note: there are other songs from this session available - ""Angel Baby"" is one - they are no better."
5,it's the rock and roll of Lennon history,"All the songs in ""Rock and Roll"" was compositions of classic voices of rock history, but John voices in this songs was wonderful.My favorite song was ""Standy by Me"" but i love all the songs.It's a masterpiece, a best Lennon work, a great rock album, the best of Lennon"
3,didnt fit...,cant fault the product but it didnt fit in my shelving unit. I had to go and buy a new product.
1,Did not receive!,"Would love to be able to rate these, but did not get them in my shipment even though Amazon thought I did. They refunded me the cost of this item, but could not replace. Not happy!! I really needed them to finish putting up the shelves in my cabinets!! Would like to rate Amazon on this but can't find where I'm supposed to be able to do that!!"
5,Needed this book,Needed this book to replace a lost library book. Book was in perfect condition and the librarian accepted it as a replacement instead of having to buy the book from them at retail price.
3,Mesh itches flesh,"This product although it serves the purpose, has one draw back, the mesh gets imbeded in the flesh causing skin to itch."
5,Erudite and entertaining,"I have a few of books on the crime/mystery genre. Some of them are overly academic (dry and professorial) while others are labors of love written by fans (passionate but not always insightful or even factually correct). Then there are those books that are still wonderful to read but are a bit out of date (the Haycroft, Keating and Symon books, for instance).Lehman's book avoids all these pitfalls. He's a scholar but his prose moves along and is never fussy. He covers a lot of ground but never sails into vague generalities. And his recommended reading list (always a highlight in this sort of book) is nicely put together, with a good mix of old works and new.If I had to buy a single volume for someone looking to expand his or her perspective on the history of the crime-mystery story, this would be the one."
4,A Jewel,"I just finished ""Tahn."" It has been silently waiting on my Kindle for months, and I finally opened it and began to read. I'm glad I did!The opening was splendid, and I was very curious about why Dorn was interested in saving the Lady, and the answer was slowly unfolded over time. It was comparatively slow paced, but it made more sense that way.The characters struggled with forgiveness, acceptance of forgiveness, and in very deep ways. The characters could have been more well developed, but it didn't interefere with my enjoyment of the story. It made me think of the many children today that are trapped in modern slavery around the world and gave a glimpse of what their lives--and strugles--might be like. Well done! I certainly had a hard time putting it down."
3,good book,i enjoyed this faith based book. it had some weak and shallow development overall but was inspiring in it's message of redemption and love.
2,Preachy and Predictable.,"While the story itself was nice, it was fairly standard fare as far as man has hard childhood, does bad things, woman redeems him with her faith. I found it to be too much preaching and too little plot and character development. Good thing it was free."
3,Ehh...,"It was a really good start and beginning, it instantly captured me. but as it went on, it just got a little lame. and i don't care if the say a few things about religion, but when it literally says something about it in every page, i was getting tired of the preaching. Every page was ""believe this, he'll save you, he has mercy on those..."" ect. like i said i don't care about a little but it just went over the top.. The only reason i kept reading it was becasue i wanted to know what happened..."
3,Started well ...,"I had no idea who was L. A. Kelly before I started reading this book. Half-way through the book, when references to God became more and more numerous, I did a Wikipedia search and found out she is a minister in her church. Not being a religious person myself, I still like her writing style (at least in the first half of the book) and would not mind reading another book from her, as long is not so much bent on promoting Christianity."
2,"Not exactly ""truth in advertising"" moment","I read this as a free title for my new Kindle gift. I am glad that it was offered free. I truly enjoy medeival, ""historical"" type fiction. I thought the book well written, and the characters mostly well-fleshed. However, the over the top proselytizing, Christian thumping became quite heavy handed by the last third of the book. I have no issues with Christian based fiction but think that the engaging plot got washed over by the desire to overpreach the message. To be fair, it should be mentioned in the write up that this title is heavy in Christian themes and discussion. I find that I do not wish to read the second book in this line as I really don't wish to wade through the religious smackdown created in the first to re-engage with the characters in this story."
2,"Christian novel : A Novel, lol","By 25% through on my kindle everybody is looking up and saying ""Why God"". Several of them do this. And then Jesus loves you, God heals, and on and on. I get it God loves us. The premise grabbed me in the sample I downloaded. Even free like this was I still sample books to weed out clutter in my archive.I have no problem with a good christian book, (not really my thing) I classify books as good or not and that's it, but the horse is dead quit beating him.Very easily this could have been a good book. I suspect this writer can really write. Too bad. Even samples are not proof against a bad book. Glad it was free. I did notice the sample didn't seem to have much of the religous dialog."
2,Tahn: A Christian Novel,"I couldn't make it through half of this book. Heavy-handed in Christian speak, I felt it detracted from the story itself. It was a chore to get to the point where I stopped reading because I was hoping it would get better. I don't mind books with religious undertones but this was screaming with it...sigh."
2,"""Christian' is an understatement","I could have liked this story.. the title character is almost compelling. But the ""salvation through Jesus"" is just too, too heavy handed. Maybe ""uber Christian"" is a better label. It is like Jesus/loving God is a character in this story. If I had realized just how preachy this book was, I would have never bought it, even for free. It is the first book I actually ""deleted"" from my Kindle. There is a good story... but it really just a vessel for the author's mission to spread the Word. And that's I'm sure what she had in mind. She does describe writing as her calling - this book is her outreach ministry."
4,It started great but then.....,"This book started out great with lots of action and good character building. However, about half to a 3-quarters way through it really started to slow down. It almost seemed like the story was done and the author was just trying to prolong it a bit. Overall, it's interesting and has a good plot, it just tends to be a bit preachy."
5,Moving Christian Fiction,"He is a young man with a scarred past and a gray future. She is a noblewoman, a widow of three years, branded with grief but strong in Faith. And they are a group of innocent children, orphans who have been kidnapped and are being trained by a ruthless villain.In her new novel ""Tahn"", L.A. Kelly weaves a story of forgiveness and redemption in a world very familiar, but yet very different from our own. It captures the struggle between good and evil, hatred and love, bitterness and forgiveness. Ms. Kelly's characters were believeable, her plot was strong, and I don't think she overdid herself on the romance. This book was truly touching. I read it all in one afternoon...it is a fast-paced page turner!"
4,Very good book. surprising in the story.,Good book. good story. recomended to a person looking for Gods grace. nicely written and puttogether. should be read. ww
2,Couldn't Finish...,"The beginning of this story was absolutely fantastic; I was captivated and submerged into the story. The beginning encompassed both mystery and a great style of writing.About 30-40% of the way through the book, however, the dialogue becomes rushed, and I felt like I read the same message about God's mercy at least 50 times per chapter. I am an extremely passionate Christian, but the forced dialogue ruined my motivation to continue reading. The characters had great potential to be well-developed, but the author neglected many details which would have made everything more realistic.It's a shame because it started off so great. You'll become immersed in the story from the beginning, but don't expect it to get any better; you'll more than likely end up disappointed as I did."
3,Mix Bag,"I have to say that I did enjoyed the basic storyline of this book. If the Christian characters hadn't tried so hard to change every none believer into a believer, I would have given it a much higher rating but all the proselytizing was way over the top. That took away from the storyline for me and because of that I didn't enjoy the book as much as I feel I could have! I consider myself a Christian but I do not like it when writers write that if you ONLY turn your life over to God your life will be perfect. I guess the thing that I have the most problem with in this book is that when Tahn and Vari gave themselves to God their Opium addiction is cured but not only that they kept telling all the other assassins that all they have to do is give themselves to God and they to will not have the addiction anymore. Faith writing like that drives me crazy."
2,Good story but....,I picked this book up at the library based on its interesting cover and write up on the back- I love medieval era fantasy. I had no idea though that it would be so full of proselytizing! There is no indication of this on the book anywhere. I can barely read Netta's self righteous rantings. The book has a great plot though and I am going to continue reading hoping her character matures.
2,"There's forgiveness, and then there is being a doormat","Just because I am a Christian woman doesn't mean I will open my heart to the man that murdered my husband in cold blood. I might forgive him his tresspasses, and help him turn a new leaf, but the whole idea that it is a good Christian idea for a widow to find love in her heart for the man that killed her husband is appalling. This ranks right up there with those sickos that think if a rapist impregnates his victim, she should marry him. The book starts out strong, but as it progresses the author just really force feeds her own twisted notion of forgiveness on the reader to the point of absurdity. This doesn't qualify as good Christian fiction unless you are one of those people that believe a Christian woman's place in walking behind her husband."
1,Poorly disguised propaganda,"I forced myself through this to the end because I can't stand to not finish a book. But I should have stopped and not wasted my time. I'm assuming this was the author's first attempt at writing. Poor character development, trite plot, lame action. It feels like someone wanted to write a sunday school story but tried make it interesting to draw in preteen kids so threw in some ""medieval-like"" action and setting. Every other page is some repetitive speech on God's love. Or someone says ""help me Jesus"" and is immediately cured of some sort of opium addiction with no withdrawals or work on their part. A woman in a crowd throwing things at a suspected criminal overhears him mumble something about God or Jesus and immediately stops the abuse because she now wonders ""Is he a murderer....or a Christian man?"" Because of course the two things are mutually exclusive. I even got the book free on kindle and was mad that I wasted time on it."
3,Could have been much better without the constant religious talk..,An easy to read novel with a decent story. It is a true pity that almost every page is laden with Christian content. Had the author toned down the religious element this novel could have been so much more without loosing its core message of salvation!!
2,For a free book....,"For a free book the characters were likable and I usually love Historical Novels, but this one was a little too Preachy for me."
1,Tahn: A Novel (Kindle Edition),"I read half this book. That was all I could take of being beaten over the head with the Christianity sledge hammer. The premise for the story was quite good, but there was way too much preaching for my tastes."
1,Conversion by Stealth,"I found this novel to be a thinly veiled and rather poor attempt to convert the reader to Christianity. With every second paragraph being a repeat of the infinite nature of Gods mercy it was, at times, difficult to determine that the story was both implausible and badly written. The characters were two dimensional at best and quite unbeleivable. Even if free the book is not worth the time and effort it takes to be sickened while reading it."
2,Are You Kidding Me?,"Romantic balderdash. Even for the insipid reader, this is better used to prop up the wobbly leg on the sofa."
2,Big let-down,I do not like this game at all. I don't think the questions are fun or entertaining. I don't care for the graphics (each frame is very slow) and I don't care for the overall design of the game. I was very disappointed!
2,Too short,Not like the hook and eye latches on my grandparents screen door. Much shorter than I expected. I made it work but was disappointed.
4,A very good novel,"I found this book very enjoyable. Ms. Hurley has created an intriguing plot centering around a secret past shared by the main character, Rachel, and her aunt, Madeline. Both women, strong and independent, are vividly portrayed, as are the other characters in the book. The setting, winter in Lucerne, was well described. I'm looking forward to Ms. Hurley's next novel!"
1,Dont be fooled,"I made the mistake of buying this album off of the two great reviews. If you're looking for a great band like The Tossers, Flogging Molly, The Korrs, whatever, this isn't the one. Most of it sounds like that horrible early nineties alternarock, the Gin Blossoms come to mind. It's painfully generic in it's sound and lyrics. Infact, the lyrics sound like they were written by a goofy high school kid a couple of days before the battle of the bands. The ""Irish"" sound that I usually love often comes out sounding more cajun than celtic. I almost threw this cd out of my car window on first listen. If this album is going to be sold under ""Irish rock"" it should be sold next to the Proclaimers and 500 miles from any good band like Blood or Whiskey and Flogging Molly."
4,Getting better,"HCL is Mahones' best album so far. If you're looking for a follow-up to The Pogues, don't hesitate and give this one a try."
2,Horrible Movies,"The Charterhouse of Parma: Easy vocabulary but spoken very fast. It is black and white. A crazy male runs about falling in love with everything in old fashioned skirts and we're all supposed to find him a real Don Juan. The under tone throughout the movie is the blood curdling ""kill the aristocrats"" of the violent underclass.La Bandera: Foul language. Black and white. A starving French male enters the Spanish Foreign Legion and marries a prostitute. It is boring and stupid.A Ravishing Idiot. Easy vocabulary. It is black and white. The movie is awful. It consists of a spy with purple lines drawn from his eyes across the screen to female boobs. A blonde is the ""ravishing idiot.""These movies are losers."
4,average game,i don't have this game but my friend does.i like fishing so i would buy it.but if you want a really good game think of a different one
4,Great reference,A great addition to my library. My only problem was that it dosn't cover South Florida. In these troubled times everyone should know what plants you can use to suppliment your diet in an emergency. This book makes it easy to identify the plants and gives helpful comments on preperation and cautions.
5,Very informative book!,"Very well written, very informative. I can't wait to put it to use in the field. Great self-sufficiency and survival advice."
4,Well written.,"This book is very well written. it contains over 400 drawings and 78 color photos, to help in the identification of the mentioned plants. Each entry contains information on habitat, when they flower, a description and the uses. Also conatins any applicable warnings. The line drawings are very accurate and are more than enough, when coupled with the descriptions, to be able to identify just about any plant. But if you have any doubts, check the color photos. Also, at the back of the book, it contains the various types of plants divided up into habitat, and then each habitat divided into what plants can be harvested there during various seasons. This book is a great resource for any survivalist's bookshelf."
5,The best of the East,I teach wild edible plants and this is the best identification book for the Eastern and Centeral states that I have found.It has very good line drawings and some good color pictures in a section by themselves. It has graphig symbols showing how each plant can be used.
1,Almost Useless,This book has very few color illustrations. Most plants are shown in black and white. The uses and descriptions often times leave you scratching your head. I would NOT feel confident using this book to identify and consume wild plants.
3,Not quite as good as the medicinal,The pictures aren't good enough to make identification easy. Good information if you have another book to identify the plants with.
4,Awesome book,"It lacks detail describing the plants and edibility of all parts.You'll find this out if you watch ""eat the weeds"" on youtube, Green Dean is the best!Also plants are repeated because of how they categorize them.but overall it's a good start. Add Edible and medicinal plants by Tilford and you'll be set."
3,Good book,"Gives a good listing about the plants you might find.The second best book on the subject I have found,It is a good book to refer to."
5,Good,Better than I expected very detailed great illustration and explinations I would recommend to my friends and family. I had my reservations but I was pleasently surprised
4,Good descriptions..,I would have liked to see more photos in this book. Overall I think it's fairly inclusive and the descriptions of plants are good.
4,Not the best choice for a novice forager.,"Overall rating: 4 starsPlant identification: 2 starsPlant uses: 2 starsPicture type(s): black & white drawings, color photographsWho will find it useful: forager who are already good at identifying plantsNotes: This is the book everyone buys to teach themselves wild edible plants and it contains the most plants by far. If you can identify the plant by some other means this is probably the book to tell you if it's edible, especially up north or on the east coast. Most people find it to be a poor reference for identification purposes and it only gives the barest of information on how to use/eat the plant. If you are a beginner forager I strongly recommendThe Forager's Harvest: A Guide to Identifying, Harvesting, and Preparing Edible Wild Plantsas your first book."
2,Regretful buy,"I'm really disappointed with this book. The black and white pictures aren't hardly as detailed as they should be for such poor, colorless representation of the plants. How in the WORLD am I supposed to accurately spot edible wild plants when the drawings are so lame?! I'm not stupid, I know how to utilize a book to my best advantage, and at most I would say you could use this book as a cross-reference but this would not be the only book I would take with me while foraging. I initially had doubts about this book when I looked at the negative reviews, but was optimistic. Now I wish I had chosen another book. Lame Lame Lame."
2,"Lots of Information, But Difficult to Determine What Plant is Being Described","There is a wealth of information packed into this book, but it is very difficult to really get into it and understand: as the old saying goes, a picture says a thousand words and while there are certainly a lot of black and white pictures, there are only 15 pages (or less than 5% of the total page count) of color pictures. It would be very easy for misidentification to occur due to hand-sketched nature of a black and white drawing of various plants - while I understand color pages cost more, I'd have certainly paid it so I could make a better determination of what I was observing in the wild. The text in this manual is excellent, but I have a hard time being able to point a particular section of this book to a visual of whatever the plant is in the guide. Knowing my luck, if I relied solely on this guide I would be preparing something poisonous."
4,A Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants: Eastern and central North America,"Very fast shipping and very well priced, I would like to have seen more color pics of plants and vegetation other than that I would recommend this book for anyone who has a desire to better understand how to find food if lost in the woods."
1,Buyer Beware,"Though still an excellent field guide buyers should be aware that this book is merely a rejacketed version of the 1977 edition. It has not been updated and the recommended reading list in the back does not contain material published past 1976. The September 1999 publishing date doesn't mean you are getting the most up to date field guide on wild edibles, just a new cover on an old reference book."
1,Disapointed,"I bought this field guide because it was recommended highly in other books with related subjects. Being that I am fairly new to wild edibles I do not find it useful at all. The plant descriptions and pictures are to vague. A lot of the plants that I am familiar with are poorly represented by the drawings. Some plants that I know have dangerous look a likes are not cautioned. Lastly, I can accept black and white drawings of the plants(if they are accurate), but shouldn't at least the the poisonous ones be in color. I definitely would not gamble my survival on this field guide."
3,Book,Good info however all the images are black and white sketches. This book would be great if the pictures were color.
3,Eh... I guess it's okay,Unfortunately this book is more like a cookbook for plants that one would find in a forest. Although it has a good deal of breadth I feel like it is more for the little house on the prairie experience than the Bear Grylls style existence.
3,Should Have,Everyone should have a copy as a part of a library. This should not be used as your only source of information.
2,Not my thing..,"Why does this cd not appeal to me? Well, it doesn't have what it takes (in my opinion) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat. His previous songs did that. Sure, Will is growing and I hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me. I expected more. Should you buy this cd? Sure! If you're a fan of Will then go for it. If you want a totally different style of Will then give it a bash. If you're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then I suggest you pick another cd."
1,Don't you realize who writes these reviews?,"In response to FatVase's posting, be wary of the reviews that you read here. There are 14 glowing reviews of ""Friday's Child"". Which is coincidentally, exactly the number of staff in BMG's marketing department in London. Who did you really think takes the time and effort to post comments here anyway??? Next time, skip the reviews and call up the record company moguls and ask them if they think you should buy the damn CD."
1,What a piece of garbage!!!,I bought this based on the two previous reviews which are dead wrong. There is nothing orginal about this album. It is still just manufacturered idol crap. I will give 'just will' the benifit that he has a strong voice but this album is not worth buying unless you want idol drival.
3,not real will yet,"I followed Will's progress on Pop Idol with interest and dismay - I knew that once he won his quirkiness and jazzy, alternative style would be polished out of him. Well, this album is way better than the first, but it does not show off his true character yet. He is not a pop singer, he's much more than that, I just hope he gets a chance to develop within the obviously constricting ties his label has on him before he loses interest."
3,Not so bad...,"Actually, the dried shrimp needs to be softened first. You wouldn't need to worry about its shell. It needs to be soaked in water for 15-30 minutes. Its ready when its soft enough to be easily chopped up. Then it can be used in stir fry. The price here is ridiculously expensive. It should only be around $2-$3 at an asian market."
2,dried shrimp,"I purchased with the idea to use in my stir fries and fried rice for vibrant flavoring, but I didn't realize it had the shell on them yet so I had to hand clean those tiny little shrimp to use as intended. They tasted OK, but more trouble than I anticipated for my needs."
5,Amazing,"The Clash is one of the greatest bands ever, no matter what anyone may say, and as for the reviewer ""Fred Dursts Numba One Fann"" everyone knows you aren't serious, which can be funny once or twice, but I have seen your reviews, all twenty pages, it's old, get a life."
4,The Essential Clash: Truly the Essentials!,"The Clash are a good British punk band, and this set demonstrates that. The reason for 4 stars? The Clash aren't my least favorite punk band (that honor goes to NoFx) but i've heard better.The first CD is my favorite, it's all of their early stuff in chronicalogical order, and this disc is better than the mediocre 2nd disc. The Clash were trying to change their style into many different forms and the result is a mixed bag.The only song I really like on the 2nd disc is ""Should I Stay Or Should I Go."" My favorites on the 1st are White Riot, London's Burning and Capital Radio One.If you like the Clash, you'll like:Ramonesand the Sex Pistols.Bottom Line: A good CD, but I coulda survived without the second disc."
5,Essential for sure...,"...as the title suggests. If you only listen to one punk band, the Clash should be it. I used to really dislike punk--then the Clash's box set, The Clash on Broadway, was released, and I got a chance to hear a bit more of what I'd been missing: ""Clash City Rockers,"" ""I Fought the Law,"" and of course, the radio tracks like ""Train in Vain"" and ""Rock the Casbah."" These guys were smarter, snider, and more talented than most of the punks who were out there at the same time or who came after them, and they gave rock 'n' roll the shot in the arm it so desperately needed in 1977.... I quite agree with the customer who said that today's crop of punk bands cannot possibly hold a candle to the Clash. This is the real deal."
4,Lucky Clash!,"This compilation does a good job of gathering the highlights of The Clash. As with all anthologies, you can argue about what songs should or shouldn't have been included,but nevertheless a well chosen and thorough collection. The most promising thing is the improved sound quality of these recordings. I really hope Rhino learns something from Sony and puts together a Deep Purple anthology like this one. Two jam packed CD's from the ""classic"" Purple lineup. One greatest hits disc is NOT enough and the 4 disc set is way too expensive.This is a very reasonably priced and well put together collection!"
2,"The clash is a pop band, not a punk band !!!","It's clear than many of thoses song have been written for radio... The Clash are to Punk what Poison are to Metal !!! You woN,t find real punk music here, only early 80 pop songs... If you are looking for punk, try The Sex Pistols, The Ramones or The Stooges, but not the Clash..."
2,"Great band, bad compilation","Spanish Bombs or no, this collection is yet another attempt to suck more cash from Clash fans. If you really want a great collection of the Clash, buy the boxed set (and London Calling of course). It does a much better job of sorting through the GEER, Sandinista!, Combat Rock and the Black Market material than this collection."
5,Excellent recording,This cd serves as a spectacular document of Astor Piazzolla musicaL genius. All the muscians are top instrumentalists and the color of Jenifer Hines dark mezo is a dream for Maria. Her voice is a wonder of nature. I owed 5 versions of Maria and like all of them. This work can take different interpretations.However my favorites are this version and in spite of not an ideal sound the operatised version on Milan records recorded in 1989. The Milan version brings the operita to a grand opera status and it sounds great. If you love good music definetly buy this cd and also the Milan
5,Black Belt,"An engaging adventure enfolds when Bushi escapes a gang of school yard bullies by fleeing into a karate studio. He falls, losing consciousness and dreams (another interpretation from the book jacket is that he travels back in time) he meets the master who founded the school and has an adventure, in which he learns to escape a larger adversary by jumping aside during an attack. When he reawakens, he uses this technique to land the bully in a fountain and escapes again to attend karate class. Includes small glossary of Japanese words used in the story and vivid illustrations."
3,ProTrain,"This was one of the first commercial addons for MSTS and I bought it news way back then. I loved this route from the start and still use it today. The scenery has held up okay over the years and there are pleanty of other routes out there there are better in that regard, however, this is still a great route. You get the feel of a real life in this sim that many other MSTS routes just don't have. And the length of run is fantastic. In addition to that with a little research you can build out real schedules, real trains and get a feel for the great DB system. The ProTrain series has gone on to create many more great routes and I have many of them, but I still come back to this one because it was the first and it really showed what could be done with MSTS."
3,Germany on the Moon,"This particular add-on for MSTS can be worthwhile, now that it's being sold used for almost nothing. Pro's: very long trip... be prepared for at least three hours just getting from one end of the track to the other. The included engines are well done, if not quite the same quality as default MSTS trains. Con's: Very little scenery... mile after mile of slate grey (very moon-ish)flatland filled to the brim with trees in between the actually very well done cities. If you play MSTS at all, go ahead and get this add-on... used here on Amazon. Do not pay full price.BIG EDIT: I guess I needed to just drive down the track a bit farther. I used the ICE high speed train, put it to 100% throttle, and just let it run. Once I got away from the cities, and closer to the lake/river, the scenery improved dramatically. Very nice lake side drive, with tall cliffs on your sides. I take back what I said about the moon surface... you just gotta take the whole trip to see the fine details."
3,"Fun, but a bit off-the-mark","The author selects some interesting case studies, and presents them in a comprehensive manner. Sometimes too comprehensive though, as the book can get bogged down in some arguably irrelevant history. There are quite a few typos, some of which are material. Additionally, the author fails to make many unique insights about the lessons to be learned, and sometimes has difficulty concluding a case with a moral (the ""How to Avoid Them"" part). While this book is an interesting read at times, and provides a good background of the nature of business failures, you will enjoy the book more if you do not expect too much."
1,"Interesting cases, not well written","While the cases referenced in this book are interesting cases to study, reading each case was difficult because much of the information is repeated and extraneous information is added. The book could be condensed to 25% of its size easily with a big red pencil."
3,Classic business but not conclusively told,"I like business case studies like this book and while I enjoyed it, it did not ""wow"" me. The studies are clinically written and as a reviewer already stated, it really doesn't address the second part of the title, ""how to avoid them"". I didn't learn from the book but it was mildly interesting. I particularly like the Montgomery Ward story where you have to almost laugh at the companies stupidity. Read if you like the subject and have the time but don't expect a ""bestseller""."
2,Interesting but not that in-depth.,All you have to do is read the first paragraph and the last paragraph to understand the problems. A bit too simple.
5,Rug Hooker Bible,"I am pleased with the book --as a beginning rug hooker, I find it very helpful--as a Christian I find the name disrespectful, but I do understand the reason for it--I just think they could have chosen something more appropriate--but anyone looking for a helpful guide at home would find it very useful--"
4,Rug Hooker's Bible,"This is a fine book, informative, thorough, well illustrated. I have only one complaint about it, and that is that the old-fashioned way of hooking rugs is not included, ie, the so-called ""primitive"" method, done using a shuttle hook and thin strips of wool (usually from thrift shop clothing). There is no discussion of this fine old method, and I would have liked to have that included. Otherwise, an excellent book, great for ideas."
5,Excellent book,"I bought this book as a companion to Janet Reid's basic book and this one is just a step up from Janet's. This one shows various techniques and answers questions such as ""how do I do corners"" and ""how can I shade a flower"" -- worth the money"
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars,"A good movie, but the acting is c-o-r-n-y, as is the plotline. Please, would a guy be *THAT* desperate to scare everyone? Also who's scared of some croaking old man...unrealisitc in realism, but a good flick, low on scares. Quality seems to lack."
2,Get that thing away from me,"Once again, another stupid kid puts on the evil mask and can't get it off. The kids are scarier here than in CHILDREN OF THE CORN. Don't watch for shock value. If the front cover of the video box doesn't clue you on what you're in for, nothing will. The show will just have to live on being a LITTLE BETTER than Nickelodeon's ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK? The biggest surprises are the role of the original character and the desparation that you don't really see in numero uno."
4,A modern novel worth reading...,"I occasionally found the novel a bit creepy... this was written and put out slightly before 9-11, and it became a book, that, under the light of recent events, becomes an exploration of international relations and the roots of terrorism ( at least, the cultural war between certain eastern factions and certain western factions, some of which dated back to at least world war two, when two of the main male protagonists meet). Epic is scope, covering most of the twentieth century in one form or another, the only downside of this book is similiar to other epics: As it broadens its scope it loses some of its sharp focus. Smith would have done well to focus less on some of the generational skirmishes and more of the cultural issues surrounding London in the late twentieth century. And the last chapter is a bit confusing."
4,cool,still in the middle of it but i like it a LOT so far. writing is very witty and its a fun read. i'm not really sure where its going but the second generation is hilarious.
3,A bit overrated,"I was disappointed in this novel after reading the high praise it received. Smith has written a very ambitious book--touching on religion, race, nationality, the British--Indian dilemma, sex, adolescence, idealism, fanaticism in the name of religion, animal rights, etc.--I'm afraid she tries to do too much. I never got a handle on her older male characters--Samad and Archie--who dominate the first half of the book. She does better with the next generation, and her portrayal of Irie comes alive--but then again, she's a 24 yr. old black woman (or Indian?) who lives in London, and in Irie the author portrays someone she seems to know VERY WELL. Certain set pieces come alive--the hair scene with Irie,the description of her school, and oddly enough given my prior comments, the war scenes--but all in all I found this one hard to plow through."
2,"Earnest attempt, but falls short of the mark","Sections of this novel were full of rich detail, but the story never came alive. The characters could have been more interesting and animated. What could have been an engaging story somehow fell short. I will be curious to see what Zadie Smith does next."
4,an epic of a first book,"White Teeth is a story that has something for everyone! It all begins with Archie trying to gas himself in a car and being 'rescued'. From there it touches on marriages, wives, husbands, children, brothers, sisters, grandparents, friends and the relationships they all have with each other.It's funny, touching, ambitious and really worth a read. Congratluations Zadie on such a spectacular first novel."
2,Two for language art,"This story was incredibly drawn out. I guess I've been reading too much E.Lynn Harris and Eric Jerome Dickey because I did not get this sistah at all. Too many characters, too many plots, too many words to describe one simple thing. I'll leave it to the elitist. Glad I only paid half price."
3,Great intro.....,"The reviews I read were wonderful, and I got this book for Christmas. The beginning was engaging. The descriptions of Clara and her experiences were dynamite. I was loving this book. Then, somewhere about 1/3 of the way through, I had no idea why this person was here or that person was there, and it bogged down. I completely lost interest."
3,Filled with awkward downtrodden people,Beautiful use of language does not conmpensate sufficiently for content. Well written but too depressing. I got past half way but didn't bother to finish it. Maybe you would enjoy it if you find great character studies fascinating - the intention might have been to be sadly funny.
5,360 degrees of integration,"This novel has it all -- great characters, characters of all types from many races and social strata, humor, pathos, social commentary (between the lines), great writing. Makes me think we're in the 21st century and the world is very different than it was during the previous three thousand years."
1,"Aims high, falls low","It's tough to write a plausible novel in you mid-twenties. You've had limited life experience. Even worse, you don't yet realize that. If you're wise, you stick to your personal sphere and come out with something like disguised autobiography, and many authors have found success following that formula. Stray from it at your peril because if you're brilliant, you'll end up with Pickwick Papers. But if you're ordinary you'll produce something like White Teeth. This is another in that depressing line of books written by someone who's looked at life mainly through a TV set. Characters ape their on-screen representations instead of the other way around and are consequently believable only to those for whom life mimics pulp fiction. The story hops around in a vain attempt at drama and creativity. There are excellent books up for literary awards in the UK this year and some fine first novels (try Azzopardi's The Hiding Place). How White Teeth finds its way into their company escapes me."
3,Charming,A witty tale with an important message. I really like this author as a person after reading this book even though I do not know her.
2,My wife is currently reading this book...,"...She had to read a few passages to me - not because they were amazing - rather, because they had to do with Vespa motorscooter details, and I'm a fanatic. Anyway, her facts about the Vespa, model year/speed/color, etc. are all wrong. I know this is a minute detail but, it kind of throws the read - in this case my wife - off. Just for the record the Vespa GS was not produced for sale until 1955. Maybe she can add this to the list of edits for the next edition. By the way, my Vespa GS can go 70 MPH downhill, not a mere 22 MPH!"
1,Don't Bother!,"I am an avid reader and seldom do something as blashemous as to throw a book into the trash, but this is where this one has ended up. It's a sad state of affairs when garbage like this gets rave reviews. Guess you can accomplish anything with good press. How could anyone compare this author to Dickens is beyond me. Save your money and avoid the waste of time and money contained within the cover of this book."
1,Cruel Britannia,"I share a lot in common with Zadie Smith and was honestly expecting to love this book; I completely bought the hype and the comparison to Dickens thrilled me. I have to say though that Smith is no Dickens. Charles Dickens had compassion for his characters even when they were presented as caricatures. Zadie has the caricature part down but needs to work on the feeling. Such a cold cruel book, goodness. An author should have other things in mind when setting down to write a book, things besides proving how clever or better they are than the rest of us especially the poor losers who people their novels."
1,Tedious At Best!,"Tedious at best! Just as a character begins to develop,the author is off on another track. If you like lots offlashbacks, bits and pieces of each character and have alot of time, then you may find the book interesting. Thepotential was there, but the author apparently felt thatshe would rather be ""clever"". A no vote for this one!"
2,White Teeth,Very hard to get into. Was not an easy read. If you had patience you might enjoy it but it was not by any means a quick read.
2,Just not that good,"I am really having a hard time getting through this book. It is not holding my interest in the way a(ny)book usually does. I'm reading it for my book club and finding it a struggle. But I read four other books this weekend that had me gripped tight! i can't relate or get into the characters. I don't understand why they do what they are doing. and sometimes i think the author's language, sentence construction and word choices are getting in the way of telling the story. with this book, i have the same frustrated feeling i sometimes get when i don't quite understand what makes some modern art so ""good."""
1,Couldn't plow through this one.,"I couldn't finish this book. I just got tired of the people and it didn't seem like there was really a plot. Lots of potential, great dialog, interesting ethnic melting pot, but it lost me."
2,Grinding (my) teeth (would be more enjoyable),"This book focuses on too many characters with too little development of any of them. I completed it without caring what happened to the multitude of people I'd been introduced to. It had religious, cultural and racial tones that were too diffuse to prove anything. It included two May/December convenience marriages; Muslim extremist vs. agnostic/buddist vs. born-again Christian extremists; stereotypical rejection of all that is East or West--destiny vs. scientific intervention; and racial undertones that were off base at best. An implausible and meddling ""perfect"" family attempts to come in half way through the book and fix the poor mixed up lower classes who are too ignorant to take care of themselves. To some, this apparently makes for a 4 1/2 star story. If you still feel a need to read it, check it out at the library and make sure you don't have overdue fines--it isn't worth it."
1,dazed and confused!!!!!!!!,"This could be, by far, one of the worst books I have ever read! I actually had to log on to Amazon and read the editorial review in an attempt to explain (or understand for that matter) what the book was about. An extremly slow, wordy, overly elaborate first novel, with no particular reason for being. I will say that the author has a wonderful ear for dialogue and all of her voices are quite believable, but that's all I can say. Spare yourselves and take those many hours it will take you to plod through this mess and take a nice long drive in the country!"
1,Over- rated,"I usually finnish a book by the end of the week but I find it hard to finnish this one because of its very flat charaters, the fact that you can't care or want to care about the characters, the plotline was like something out of Eastenders and also the fact that its very unrepresentative glimpse of black and Asian communities."
2,Yawn.,"Not a single person in our book group could get through this book. I kept trudging through hoping something would happen, then just gave up."
1,Embarrassingly bad,"WHITE TEETH's problem is less its story than Ms Smith's style, which reminded me immediately of Douglas Adams. But while the late Adams's constant authorial presence, leaning over the reader's shoulder to shoot acute observations at his characters, their plight or just plain LIFE, was perfect for his offbeat genre fiction, it is immediately grating in WHITE TEETH. The author lacks the wit (and, perhaps, life experience?) to make that style work, and it sits poorly with the suburban banality she seeks to ground the characters in. Frantically page-turning to see when Marvin the Paranoid Android showed up, I bailed at ~p.100, with no interest in the characters whatsoever."
2,Non-credible writing.,"Somewhat interesting, but slow reading. My personal annoyance is her complete misrepresentation of Jehovah's Witnesses. At first I thought it was amusing and a great basis for a character. However, I am personally acquainted with many Witnesses, and her many mistakes in describing their beliefs is disturbing. I realize that this is a novel and it involves fictional characters, but she misstates so much that it erodes my belief in anything she has written about other characters and their customs and backgrounds, be it Islamic, Bengali, East Indian, West Indian, British, or whatever. She is completely non-credible as an author. Try again."
5,"Eponymous, stygian, Parallax in intent, Neo-phreudiacism","I don't know where to start! This novel is a pager turner of an incredible story with an abyss of emotional depth that will leave the reader spent, shaken out of his or her wooden workaday existence. The descriptions of the dust-bowl and the Depression (the period following the stock market crash of 1929) made me weep more than once. The cast of characters calls to mind Dickens, and the presence of artificial limbs is outright Melvillian. Features also the excellent use of a fey man as the embodiment of a wooden, post-columbian textual figure. A must for teachers, students and parents who care about the rainforest.I just bought three of these to give out as birthday presents this year. And plan to buy more for Christmas. This is definitely a heartbreaking work of incredible genius."
1,I Don't Have The Time,"I don't have the time to list all of the factual inaccuracies in this book.It is terribly distracting to read the best written prose or watch the best told film that have been poorly researched.The next time this author decides to write, homework needs to be done, and better editors need to be selected.Sorry, but we are not all that ill informed, naive or, stupid. I spent a year in Jamaica and traveled extensively throughout India on numerous trips.Please have some respect for your readers intelligence."
3,"Impressive first novel, but not a GREAT book","I have to say that I really enjoyed this book for the most part. I found it a really comfortable read and quite comical at points. However, it seemed to have a lot of careless editorial mistakes that kept distracting me. At one point, I am pretty sure she gets the twins confused and some of the dialogue didn't fit so well with the time period the story was supposed to be taking place in. Again though, I think these errors have to do with inexperience, (although I imagine the editor had slightly more, what went wrong?)I also thought the ending was really weak, I loved the way she built up the characters and the action, but it all seemed to kind of flop around at the end.Worth reading and I look forward to more in the future..."
4,"An impressive, beguiling debut","Zadie Smith's ""White Teeth"" is a pure delight and stands head and shoulders over most literary debuts. What carries this along is the vibrancy of the words; it boggles the mind to think how anyone, regardless of age, can make such ordinary lives come to life in such unexpectedly varied ways. The scope is what I like most about 'White Teeth.' Unlike most so-called literary novels, Smith takes on the big external issues -- race, class, history, even genetic engineering -- without losing her affection for her characters. Much like David Foster Wallace, or even (yes) Salman Rushdie, there is a big palette of ideas, places, and backgrounds on display here. Each character gets his or her full due and chance to make a deep impression, without the plot strands coming undone. It's a big ride, only sometimes pretentious, filled with great humor, satire, and best of all heart."
2,"Same old, same old","While ""White Teeth"" is at times a funny and interesting novel, it is symptomatic of many such books and films about British ethnic minorities, for example ""Bend it like Beckham"". While the hardships of serving up curry or running a corner shop might raise a few laughs first time round, to turn the observation of cliches regarding South Asians and Jamaicans in Britain into a fictional genre is a step too far. And this is what ""White Teeth"" is - not more than a catalogue of cliches regarding Bangladeshis and Jamaicans. The characters are likeable but rather one-dimensional - why buy ""White Teeth"" when you could chat to a Jamaican or a Bangladeshi about their historical experiences ?"
1,Don't bother,I have just finished this book well actually I've got about another 100 pages to go and I don't know if I can be bothered to read anymore. I had heard such good things about this book but I really just couldn't get into it and even now all this way through I am not sure what the point of the book is. As for laughing out loud well I felt more like crying. Over-hyped and over-priced.
1,Sucks!,"Don't believe the hype! This tripe may have appeased the politically correct crowd, but My God, give me a break. Unfunny, preposterous drivel. Obviously, Ms. Smith must have a very good friend or family member in publishing. Just abysmal. Save your money."
3,Please explain the ending!,"After struggling through this book for nearly a month, enjoying some of it, I get to the end and don't understand anything that happens! Some doctor turns up I've never heard of (or can't remember from earlier in the story), Sam is cursing Archie (for what?), chaos reigns and the rodent runs for it. WHAT???!!!"
1,could someone correct the record please?,"Why were Smith's glaring mistakes passed over? Because everyone likes to laugh at colonial subjects and so getting it right is the least of it? Well just to say that ""irie"" is not Jamaican for ""no problem."" ""No problem"" is Jamaican for ""no problem."" Irie is a rastafarian word that means many things but usually a deriviation of cool, nice, okay... As for the other erroneous stuff about Jamaicans in the novel (it's difficult to imagine a Jamaican 19 year old woman calling a white 47 year old Briton ""pickney""), I guess it goes to prove that having the blood doesn't necessarily mean you understand the culture better than the typical outsider."
3,"I ENJOYED IT BUT,",FELT THE AUTHOR HAD TOO MANY THINGS GOING AT ONCE MAYBE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF BOOKS I AM NOT SURE
3,Many generations,"I started this book not thinking I would like it. Not sure why, but maybe because friends didn't seem thrilled. Maybe because reviews were mixed. But in the end I enjoyed it quite a bit. At points it had a rather Salman Rushdie feel, but there was less fantasy and more realism involved. I found the dilemmas characters faced to be quite pertinent in today's world of melting pots and mixed identities. This story follows numerous generations of three families through their formative experiences, focusing on the youngest generation. Through it all Zadie Smith examines how our personas are affected by the past we conceive, the future we envisage, and the present we inhabit. I enjoyed the use of vernacular speech, which I often heard out loud in my head (probably terribly cliched).A quote I liked: ""Mad Mary was looking at him with recognition. Mad Mary had spotted a fellow traveler. She had spotted the madman in him (which is to say, the prophet)..."""
2,We don't get it,"My book group tackled this book after hearing rave reviews from National Public Radio talk shows. White Teeth was touted as THE best book of the summer. Most of the women in the group of 15 went out and purchased the book in hardcover, hoping for a wonderful experience.Instead, only two women in the group even finished the book. With the exception of one member, all found this book's characters impossibly hard to care about. The skilled writing style was not enough to keep us interested in continuing. Our discussion centered around WHY critics picked this book and WHY we didn't get it."
2,Lack of research on her part,"For about 1/3 of the book, the stories seemed to flow really well. After a while, I had a pretty hard time getting through the book. My biggest issue is her misinformation on Jehovah's Witnesses. As someone who's mother is one, I know for a fact that most of what she wrote about them is totally incorrect, and downright demeaning. You don't have to like or even tolerate someone of another religion, but at least get your facts straight before writing about them."
3,Very Solid Debut,This is a solid debut novel. The characters are funny and Smith brings to life an evolving Britain. This is a pleasure to read.
4,A rich and ambitious work,"This is a multi-layered, multi-cultural novel about the lives of a couple of seemingly opposite friends and their families, spanning from the end of World War II to the nineties.Archie is a native Brit with a Jamaican wife and a stubbornly independent daughter. Samad (or Sam, as Archie calls him) is a Bangladeshi immigrant trying to make a good (and properly Muslim) life for his wife and twin sons in England. The story winds its way through their friendship from its odd beginning during the war, through the complicated events that befall their children and finishes with a bang-up ending that ties all loose ends neatly together, in the manner of Tom Wolfe.Smith succeeds in breathing life into all of her extremely disparate characters, and manages to write convincingly about WWII, genetics and the beliefs of Jehovah's witnesses, among many other wide-ranging subjects. All this in a first novel, written in her early twenties!"
3,"Great Stylist, Boring Plot","I must commend Zadie Smith for being a gifted prose stylist, but alas she says too much in crisp prose that lacks the emotional and intellectual resonance of a William Gibson or Salman Rushdie. ""White Teeth"", her literary debut, is her courageous effort at trying to be funny while dealing with an interesting issue, race relations in Great Britain. Alas her efforts are muddled with a meandering storyline involving members of the Iqbal and Jones families, headed memorably by expatriate Bengali Muslim Samad Iqbal and British Protestant Christian Archie Jones who form an improbable friendship during the waning days of World War Two in Central Europe that lasts through the present. Most of the plot deals with the sons and daughter of these families as they navigate through the vicissitudes of life, often with much unexpected hilarity. This is a well written novel that could have easily been one hundred pages shorter and yet still have made its points most effectively."
1,Grossly overrated,"I was traveling to London for two weeks and saw this book recommended highly as a current composite on British life. In short I regret the time I spent reading it. It is a mass of stereotypes, disjointed stories and poor writing."
4,"Good Read, Good Characters","Very funny sketches of (near) contemporary British life. Deep characters, appealing plot.But WHY has it been 'translated' (or whatever the term is) for American readers? The British don't talk in terms of 'traffic circles' (roundabouts) or '182 pounds' (13 stone), and yet some classic Brit-speak ('fruit machine', which means 'slot machine' and not 'juice press') has been left untouched.Highly recommended, but in the interests of cultural integrity buy the original Brit-version."
3,"Burried Plot, yet beautiful characters","I was on page 186 when I finally realized what this book was about and once I did, though it intrigued me a bit, I was ultimately disappointed. I give this book a three because the author's voice was mature and the characters were deep and complex. The story's road map was confusing at times and often wondered who and what the story was really about. The ending actually seemed rushed, especially with Irie having sex with the twin brothers and nothing ever developing further, except a pregnancy. Another positive was the rich dialogue of all the cultures involved: Jamaican, British, Indian."
3,"interesting read, NOT riveting","I think this is a great book to explore the themes from a cultural studies post-colonial perspective. I liked it at times, but my English college students HATED it for a plethora of reasons folks already mentioned here.One thing that BUGGED me was the over use of""it was a kind of past-tense, present-perfect moment...""At first I loved that use of description as a teacher of writing, but the 3rd time I wanted to scream.Otherwise, check it out!"
3,A tedious disappointment,"I became interested in reading this book after reading many wonderful reviews. After having read it, I must say I was disappointed. The beginning of the book had me hooked, but I had to force myself to finish it. The writing is superb, the characters are very colorful and interesting, but the story just didn't interest me. The book is about three main families: the Joneses( English father, Jamaican mother, one daughter), the Iqbals ( Bengalis, mother and father, twin sons) and the Chalfens (English, mother and father and four sons). It deals with immigrants trying to assimilate, cultural differences, family conflicts, racial issues, religious issues. Too much going on! I also was let down by the ending."
3,Overrated but a great idea,This book was a disappointment perhaps because it received such great reviews; had I discovered it by accident I would probably have enjoyed it more. The mix of characters are interesting but it took a great many pages to get the plot together and I was still waiting when I turned the last page. If the author had focused less on the writing of a good book and more on the telling of a good story it might have made all the difference.
2,Slow Moving,"Although the book did prove to be well written the story itself seemed to get lost in too many words. What started off as a promising and entertaining story soon took a turn for the worst. Unfortunatly I feel compelled to finish a book once I have commited to starting it. I found myself flying through the second half just to get it over with. Thankfully the last couple of pages were able to spark my interest, but not enough to redeem itself."
2,"Inspired, Erratic, Promising, Clunky First Effort","White Teeth is an exploration of race, genetics, belief and family set mostly in the eighties and early nineties with flashback to WWII and the seventies.Zadie Smith has a pungent, comic style that is readable but not moving. I was intrigued by Millat, Samad and Joyce but didn't really care about them.The book displays deep knowledge of race and of being nonwhite in England but I found its forays into ""science"" murky and unconvincing.As a whole, the book fails to provide a convincing narrative or to develop its characters. Archie, whose attempted suicide opens the book, is sadly neglected.However, there are some wonderful moments such as Archie's discovery of his future wife, Samad's struggle with lust and Joyce Chalfen's obession with Millat.I can't recommend the book but I wouldn't be surprised if the author improves with age and ends up writing a book I heartily recommend."
3,Disappointed,"My book club, a group of six Black women, read this book, for our last book club meeting. While we all agreed that Zadie Smith does indeed have a flair for writing, and writes extremely well we were disappointed and a little confused as to why this book was given rave reviews. Not one of us could make the connection between the title ""White Teeth"" and the story. So, obviously we missed something in the story. Usually, the meaning of the title is revealed somewhere in the plot. We thought the plot was very weak Can someone explain what ""White Teeth"" means. Also, not one of us found this book to be enjoyable. There were high points, but there were far too many pages that just went on and on and on. Most found it painful to finish, but as a commitment to the group all but one of us finished the book. Most of the members said that they kept reading because they had invested so much time and kept waiting, waiting for something to pull them into the story. The final verdict - disappointed!"
2,Pop-fiction,"Dreadful fin-de-siecle 'pop-novel'. I had the dubious honour of coming across jean-clad Ms. Smith at a literary awards ceremony the other day and her Oasis-like grunge dress sense reminded me of her writing.White Teeth is a 'cool Britannia' novel for the Blairite age: superficial and pretentious. They can try as hard as they like, but the Oxbridge-brigade can't write authentically about the trials and tribulations of life on the povery line. Caviar anyone?"
3,Great but...,"I think Zadie Smith is an incredibly talented writer, a knack for fleshing out quirky and believeable characters and writing funny turns of phrases but...the ending is a bit of sad neglected fluff, it seems as if she needed to end the book and that was that...the plot meandered and went basically nowwhere...I can't wait for her sophmore effort, one could only hope she will improve..."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I know everyone else raved about it, but I couldn't get into these characters. The plot meandered along so randomly (all those asides and flashbacks) that I had trouble keeping interested. I finally gave up about half way through the book, which I typically don't do (I'm usually a voracious reader & finish everything, even if it's a bit boring) so I can't recommend it."
2,I wanted to like it,"As wtih many of the other reviewers, I wanted very much to like this book. A few good friends had told me how much they enjoyed it, but about half way into the book, I had to wonder if I was reading the same book they had. The characters were interesting and well developed, but I found parts of the plot to be unrealistic. The ending was particularly poorly conceived - abrupt and nonsensical. Overall, I was glad to be finished it. I am hopeful that the author's next effort is better crafted."
5,This is a riveting read,"White Teeth fully qualifies as a refreshing as novel. The characters are lively, identifiable and rich. I also found the dialogue to rich, one of the reasons that kept the book interesting throughout the read. I was entranced as to what is coming next and kept on reading and reading until the last page.With echoes of Fortune Calls, this entertaining book is a page turner that is difficult to put down until the end of the story."
4,A Favorite Novel with One Major Caveat,"Extremely insightful, witty, relevant, and pleasurable to read with the one major caveat that all the white women in the novel are one dimensional walking stereotypes who basically show up to seduce Muslim men and then crawl away with no real exploration of their motives or thought processes by the author, unlike the ones afforded to all the novel's other characters. Keeping this criticism in mind, read the book and enjoy it. Just try and find a white female character in the novel whose behavior doesn't follow this trajectory."
3,Fine Debut Novel,"I started out enjoying this novel very much. The writing is vivid, the dialogue apt, and the North London community fascinating. But at about the half way mark I began thinking of the Stephen Leacock character who jumped on his horse and rode off in all directions: I began to lost track of the many characters and the book seemed to lose focus for me. There were too many characters for me to keep in mind, and worse, many were introduced, developed, and then dropped. Likewise sub-plots were initiated and abandoned. Others have commented on the weak ending, and noted that many plot threads peter out, and are left unresolved. It seems to me there are at least two novels in this material, and probably more, alternatively a couple dozen short stories; as presently constituted the book is less than the sum of its parts. Ms. Smith has enormous gifts, but she should seek out a vigorous editor to help her manage those gifts."
3,white teeth; it aint jaws,"white teeth was an excellent book, on par with the rest the author has written. however, i was disappointed with the lack of shark references made. i felt as though a book with such an obvious title ought to have at least one paragraph (if not many more) dedicated to a character being eaten alive by a shark. other than this, it was one of the best books i ever read."
5,Most likely to recommend,"This novel is not easy to describe. Yes, there is a plot. But like ""Bonfire of the Vanities,"" the plot is secondary to the humor, the creative style, the zany minor characters, and the cultural observations.Unlike Tom Wolfe, Zadie Smith gives her characters a fairly sympathetic treatment, even as she exposes their flaws and absurdities. That actually makes her slightly more enjoyable, at least to me.If four-letter words bother you, then stay away from this book. Smith's lower-echelon Londoners cannot speak two consecutive sentences without using the f word.Otherwise, when people ask me for book recommendations this year, ""White Teeth"" probably will top my list among novels."
2,"Dull, poorly written","I was anticipating a clever, intellectual style of writing from Smith, but found the book to be a jumbled mess of uninteresting characters and a poorly developed plot. I put it down several times refusing to read any further, but it just bugged me not to finish it. By the end, I was really angry that I wasted my time. The author has very brief moments of clarity or interesting thought, but the book continuously slips back into banality. There's nothing even remotely humorous about it. It's just dull, disjointed (in the last paragraph, out of nowhere, the author addresses the reader directly??) and at times a bit crass for seemingly no good reason. A failed attempt at creating a deep and meaningful novel."
1,Worst book I've tried to read in a long time,This book is terrible. I couldn't get past 50 pages. Pitiful character development...no plot. Utterly boring. It could be the cure for insomnia.
4,Is Zadie Smith as good as everyone says she is?,Excellent beginning with Archie attempting suicide. Funny and poignant. Tries too hard at the end and loses you.
3,Sadie,I had a difficult time getting through the novel. I think more due to the fact that it is much dated for me at this time. I feel for it's time the book was a much better read. The author's background seems more interesting than her novel. It is worth the read.
2,Potboiler,"What a disappointment. Smith has cobbled together lots of stories and lots of characters, but with almost no precision whatsoever. This is a page-turner for sure, but the almost total lack of characterization or observation of human nature, and smug posturing make for a tiresome read indeed. Comparisons to Rushdie are not only totally outrageous (he knows how to write with depth, feeling, and intellect) but also mildly racist, positing as they do that any writer of color chronicling immigrant life in London must be like Rushdie. Stop thinking about buying this book and go to the master. For a book on being a colored immigrant in London, pick up Satanic Verses instead."
2,Disappointing,"I don't understand why this novel is getting such rave reviews. The first two-thirds of the book was enjoyable but not stunning - it was gritty and full of real-life dilemmas. I didn't find it particularly humorous - or at least not ""laugh out loud"" funny. As I began the final 100-200 pages, Smith was still introducing new characters to the detriment of the others that were not fully developed. The last 100 pages were intriguing as Smith wove the decisions and fates of the characters together, all pointing towards one room on New Years Eve. However, the end just plain falls apart and doesn't do the rest of the book justice. It's as if Smith herself decided the ending on the flip of a 50p coin and took about as much time to dash out the amateurish text."
3,a little boring.,"I bought this book solely on a review in Time magazine and expected to be blown away by the talent emanating from Ms. Smith. However, after forcing myself to read at least half of it, I find myself dragging my feet to finish the other half. It is simply not compelling. Perhaps it is a bigger hit in London but I don't understand why everyone is falling all over themselves about this book!"
3,Her story line left me flat,"This story is told in four parts about immigration, religion, race, sex, war, politics, and history. It's huge in scope, but I'm not sure the author pulls it off entirely. Parts of this book I found to be very interesting; the way Smith describes her characters, for instance, was impressive. Her characters are distinctive, but her story line - while massive - left me flat most of the time."
1,Over-hyped,"I agree with other reviewers who mention Smith's lack of focus in writing the story and lack of compassion for the characters. It reads like the work of a twenty-something with limited life experience who is overly proud of herself and just can't be bothered to get anything right. Flip judgments of characters don't make for an entertaining or compelling read. This is one to avoid, despite the opinions of reviewers obsessed with the writer's youth and good looks. It's a look, not a book."
1,a severe case of the emporer's new clothes,"After all the praising press,I'm curious to see how the book fares in the long view. This book was one of the rare few I put down without finishing. The author is smart (and young and good-looking) but her characters are blank and her story is flat and I was bored. It seems to have come from her head. I'll wait for the one that comes from her soul."
1,White Teeth,"Come on people, this book was highly overrated and plain old boring. I found it quite hard to get through it. Aside from Clara, characters are vacant and dull. The author just doesn't take the opportunity to develop personalities enough to conjure up any compassion in the reader. What could the editorial reviewers have been thinking of when they awarded this book such high praise."
1,Pulling Teeth,"I'm always hungry for something new - especially from new writers. And I too am more likely to finish every book I pick up. While Smith seems to have a wonderful prose style and sense of humor, reading the long speeches given by Samad Iqbal (aka ""Ick ball"") was more like pulling teeth. And Archie Jones, though believable, was absolutely unbearable!I usually read a book of this length in 2-4 evenings, but I've had this one for about a month - I just can't do it!"
2,Genuinely overrated,"This is a fine first novel and shows signs of real promise-- it's witty, thoughtful and there's lots of energy on display. But it ain't the cherries jubilee the reviewers have made it out to be. Too long, too pleased with its own verbal-strutting, the novel is more like a show and tell of dialects and set pieces than a cohesive hole. And it does tend to go on and on and on when Smith finds a character or a subject she's hooked on. One day she'll write a terrific book. This isn't it."
4,Worth Reading,"Smith does a great job with her characters, its hard to believe this is her first novel. She is very wise for her age. We read this book for my book club and it offered us a lot of interesting discussion, which is an accomplishment since we have been meeting close to 10 years now. My only criticism is that she goes into detail on some characters that never amount to anything in the book, making the book a bit longer than needed. Also, like most modern novels, it was short on plot. However, I did still enjoy it and will definately read her next book."
2,I wanted to like it I really did!,"When I picked up this book, I had high hopes for it. I love starting a new book and becoming absorbed in the world of it's characters. Finally at page 266, the only excitement I feel is that soon I'll be through with this incredibly boring novel. I feel nothing for any of the main characters. I think this book would have been far more interesting if Samad was the one sent away. Less ranting and raving from Samad and more room for all the other potentially great characters in this book."
4,White Teeth Review,"This novel is fun, humerous and somewhat educational. Zadie Smith's characters come to life to represent different cultures, religions, and beliefs. You immediately sympathize with the characters and are eager to find out if they find what it is they are looking for in life. The best aspect of the novel was the humor. Smith uses funny nicknames and odd characters to make the novel more enjoyable. Although Smith tends to go off into tangents where you seem to get lost, she quickly picks up where she left off to keep you interested."
4,Brush daily for white teeth,"This book is must read for any desi, african american, muslim, arab etc. minority. it's funny,insightful and tackles the awkwardness minorities encounter while trying to assimilate themselves into the English or American culture. I love the humorous situations that the characters find themselves in. and the worst part is knowing that i'm all too familiar with them!I didn't understand the ending, but after a bit of thinking, i may have grasped it."
3,Too Cute for Too Long,"Sharp and funny at the beginning, White Teeth loses steam about halfway through and I found myself grinding through the last 200 pages. I blame Zadie Smith's editors; after all, it's difficult (and unnecessary) to maintain carefully calibrated satire for so long unless you're Salman Rushdie (echoes of whom appear in White Teeth). What became particularly annoying was the souped up, hyper-hip and ""smart"" rhetoric that came out of the mouths of ALL the main characters. This lack of differentiation among characters that are supposedly more complex was tiresome. I'm hoping her next book will be a tight 300 pages of fun or a sprawling drama with better fleshed-out characters."
1,We Don't Get It,"My book group tackled this book after hearing rave reviews from National Public Radio talk shows. White Teeth was touted as THE best book of the summer. Most of the women in the group of 15 went out and purchased the book in hardcover, hoping for a wonderful experience. Instead, only two women in the group even finished the book. With the exception of one member, all found this book's characters impossibly hard to care about. The skilled writing style was not enough to keep us interested in continuing. Our discussion centered around WHY critics picked this book and WHY we didn't get it."
2,Listen to the Reviewers,The mid-line to one star reviewers have it right. This book is a chore to read. You do find yourself beginning to relate to a character and understand them and the author switches to another character. You will find that the author loves to hear her own voice. Or so it seems. I made it 7/8's of the way through the book and decided it was just not worth the effort. Leans toward pomposity and bombast.
3,Fell short of my expectations,"The start of this book intrigued me. I liked the writing and general atmosphere. I liked the multi-cultural background, and did enjoy seeing the world from Samal's eyes, a Bangladesh-born man living in England.The novel was funny and insightful, and my hopes were high for this book. Unfortunately, the more I read, the less interest I had. While the characters were interesting at first, they were not believable, nor particularly likeable. On top of that, there was not a plot that I could follow with interest. Yet in spite of those weaknesses, there continued to be small scenes that I did enjoy. This felt like a quality book that just just did not grab me."
2,I don't get it.,"I've just finished this novel and I must say, I just don't get it. It won two prestigious literary awards, plus has had any number of luminaries gushing over it. Huh???? I honestly don't even get what the novel was supposed to be about. It meandered all over the place, with characters dropping in and out of the narrative willy nilly. For example, Clara, who figured largely in the early part of the novel, drops out completely one third of the way through, and only makes a minor reappearance later: the author spends a long time describing the animal liberation group FATE, only to have them suddenly disappear into the ether. The characters were, without exception, objectionable, nasty pieces of work and not one of them engaged me emotionally. The novel is too long and I really found it a hard slog to wade through for very little return. I do not recommend this novel - please,spend your money on something else, don't waste your time with this."
2,This novel lacks bite.,"This book comes with a lot of hype. The blurbs are filled with the words ""funny"" and ""witty"". And it needs some humour to carry it along, since there isn't much in the way of dramatic structure. Unfortunately, for me at least, the laughs (or giggles or even smirks) were not thick on the ground. To be fair, I haven't finished the book. I kept asking myself ""Why am I reading this?"", without coming up with a good answer. The biggest problem is Archie, one of the protagonists. Given that the novel starts off in 1975, ""drip"" seems the appropriate word to describe him. A greater understanding of this character is not something the average reader would crave. Zadie Smith does do some things well in this novel. Her ear for dialogue is good, and she does the various ethnic dialects convincingly (although an American audience can't really know how authentic they are). And she writes about interracial relations in an insightful way. But it still didn't make me want to slog through this."
3,for Big City dwellers only,"This book had a huge amount critical acclaim attached to it. Smith, herself, became a literary darling overnight it seemed. I actually didnt read this book until much later after that hype died down. I really only have one resounding feeling about the book - it is extremely hard to follow Smith's direction if you haven't live in a multi-cultural melting pot. I read reviews of people in middle America saying they didn't see what all the bother is about - and they wouldn't. Having said that, even if you don't see the bigger picture she is trying to convey, the general storyline falls short."
4,Astonishing Debut,"As I read this novel I continued to be astonished that the author is only 24 years old. That was almost bothersome at first; that someone so young could enter the personas of middle-aged men of two different nationalities, and that she could do it with such confidence.If this isn't quite a 5-star novel, it is still an amazingly accomplished debut. It's literary, has depth of character and purpose of plot, and wraps up with a smooth and satisfying ending.Mary Higgins Clark and Danielle Steel readers probably won't like it; this novel takes a little work and persistance. If this is her debut goodness knows what her next endevour will be. She's definately a writer to watch."
2,A slog which would benefit from drastic editing,"Some members of our book club found the novel amusing and interesting, but the majority felt the work was a slog which would benefit from drastic editing."
2,"Strong start, woeful end","I wanted to give this book more than 2 stars--the writing is truly inspired--but the story itself fissled a good 100+ pages from the end. I worked hard to get through over 400 pages, and in no way felt rewarded by the end. Instead, disappointed. Too many characters of little or no sigficance bog down and are flat, and lead the reader astray. A little more editing would have made it tons more agreeable. Still, a remarkable undertaking for a first-time novelist"
2,Regifted Miss,"The problem with the puffy citrine heart is that it resembled its online likeness not one bit. The heart itself was a close match to what I was looking for, but the embedded 'gemstone' that looked like a red cross online, was actually a green square in person. We regifted the item to a co-worker and they loved it, but my spouse was still stiffed out of a birthday gift and my record of great presents was snapped like a twig in a typhoon."
2,gg at his worst,"well i got this cd because i love gg anything i see thats gg i get it, but i was dissapointed with this cd because the quality is horrible i couldnt hear this at all in my cd player it sounded like a bunch of mumbo jumbo. if you want good live gg get res-erected or just get a dvd"
4,"a fun, interactive space stategy game","This is one of the few cd-rom games i've found that really sticks in your mind afterwards. When you finish, it is like having been part of a graphic novel. The characters are awesome, and as the plot unfolds you are drawn into the story. Combat sequences are fun and challenging. The only weak point is the colony-building interface. For the bucks though, you can't buy a better game."
4,An oldie but a goodie,"Most reviews I have read about this game say it doesn't fulfill the Star Control series as well as the other two. I have only played this one and the second one, but I feel they are equal in quality, more or less. The main thing I like anout Star Control 3 is the gripping story that seems to change with everything you do. That is a rarity. The graphics are not great by today's standards, but they're still sufficient, especially the moving video of the aliens when you are talking with another species. Overall, this is a good bargain game which continues to be a good buy even with all the new games on the market today."
2,Doesn't live up to the name Star Control,"As a stand-alone game, this game is only average. The concept is good, but in actuality Star Control 3 lacks more than it can boast. The new hyper melee is alright, but the main game leaves a lot to be desired. The colony control could be better, the interface with the aliens could be improved, and the graphics and gameplay were terrible. If you've ever played Star Control 2 you'll be very disappointed. You can only hope that if they make a sequal to this, they get the writers to part 2."
5,Absolutely Great,"This product was exactly what I was looking for. It is porcelean and has no switch, it is only controlled by the plug. I have these hanging in my garden."
4,"Great movie, but Blu-ray doesn't have all the features the DVD has","TLADILA might be one of the best crime dramas of modern day. But be aware that the Blu-ray edition does not contain the Director's Commentary that is included with the DVD edition.Buy the Blu-ray if you are a fan or don't really care about commentary tracks. If you want the commentary track, either buy the DVD or get it from Netflix.Either way, this movie is a keeper."
5,Top 10 film,"I was surfing the web when thoughts of TLADILA came to mind. I wasn't thinking of that movie in particular. I wasn't thinking of Los Angeles. The thoughts just came to me, unprompted.This happens to me more often with this film than any other except, ""The Godfather.""I've seen the film only three times in the past 20 years and it is UNFORGETTABLE.There is nothing about it I didn't like.I can't really add anything more, in the way of a review of the movie, that hasn't already been said.Except this: I lived in L.A. for about 8 years and I can't recall any other movie that captures the unique colors, texture and feel of the city like TLADILA. This isn't the 'glam' L.A. it's the other, more organic, City of Angels. Dark and beautiful in it's own way.Simply TERRIFIC!"
1,"If you saw this when you were 16 and thought it was great, see it again.","This is what happened to me - I was embarrassed for myself. This is probably one of the worst crime films ever made - profoundly poor acting, terrible script, a soundtrack that is too awful for words. And William L. Peterson is such a detestably unsexy little man - he spends the entire movie swaggering around in a pair of tight jeans with mannerisms so studied it plays like comedy.There is nothing redeeming about this film whatsoever - unless of course you want to laugh at how ridiculously dated it all is."
1,Keystone Cops in LA,The car chase and the cops are about as good as a good ole Keystone Cops comedy.This sure as hell isn't no LA Confidential.
3,"VERY VIOLENT, VERY 80's","This particularly nasty, nihilistic movie features a bullying, misanthropic and hot headed (along with other 80's cop SOB's, Micheal Douglas in 'Black Rain' and Mickey Rourke in 'Year of the Dragon')William L. Petersen as one of the more unlikable 'heroes' you'll ever see. And he's also certainly the dumbest. He does however, go at it with considerable gusto and energy. It's hard to give a toss about him or any of the other revolting characters in this otherwise exciting cops and robbers thriller. The cast is terrific though, Willem Dafoe is a hideously reptillian bad guy and John Pankow shows just a glimmer of morality as Petersen's conflicted partner. The propulsive Wang Chung soundtrack is good and Billy Friedkin delivers his best work since 'The Exorcist'. Ironically Petersen played another intense, troubled cop in his next movie, 'Manhunter'. He is sensational in the first adaptation of 'Red Dragon'-much better than Edward Norton in the 2002 version."
5,YAY,"I actually bought my dvd back in January, and it was a case of me walking by telling my friends about this movie (which they had never heard of) and lo and behold, there it was!!! I saw this movie probably a year after it came out and was VERY EXCITED to see it finally released on DVD (i could never find the VHS version anywhere anymore).This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time ( i have been a William Petersen fan since this movie and Manhunter) and the soundtrack score just adds to it! I do plan on ordering the soundtrack very soon! This is one of those movies that if you have seen it, you have a great appreciation for it. Too bad it didn't get the respect it deserved for it's time, but for those who do remember it and love it, continue to enjoy it!! I know I will!"
5,To Live & Die In L.A.,"This is a very good movie. When this movie was first released back in the early eighties I was too young to actually see it. I just recently watched this movie about a month ago and I loved it. It was action packed from the start. The best car chase scene I've ever seen before. Better then the ones in the newer movies. William Petersen and Willem Dafoe played out their characters to the fullest, you don't want the movie to end. It's keeps your attention at the screen through out the whole movie and the ended is very unexpected. I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes action."
3,OOOOOOOVER RAAAAAATED BY FAR,"YOU TALK ABOUT HYPE. THIS ROUGE DEA COP WHO'S OUT FOR JUSTICE BECAUSE HIS PATNER IS KILLED.WHAT DID HE DO THAT WAS SO OVER THE TOP?????? ACTION, YEA MAYBE IF YOU TURN THE TV OFF AND LISTEN TO WANG CHUNG. OK MOVIE YEA AT BEST TOO LONG, NO ACTION AND THE BEST CAR CHASE MAYBE OF ALL TIME, PLEASE THIS WAS MADE IN 1985. I KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING IN THE CHASE TO BE ABOVE AND BEYOND. NOT. NOW KIDDIES THIS IS ONLY MY OPION. I LIKE DEAD BANG ALOT, I LIKE XXX AREAL LOT, I THINK CRIMSON TIDE KICKS RED OCTOBERS ASS. SO I'M NO EXPERT,LIKE SOME OF THESE CLOWNS. WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD OR BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. PLEASE. IF IT'S THE BEST THAN THERE CAN'T BE ANOTHER BEST OR WORST. IF IT ENTERTAINS YOU WHO CARES ABOUT TEC STUFF. THIS MOVIE WAS SLOW AND I WAS WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. IT NEVER DID. DONE GONE PEACE!"
5,Still one of my favorites twenty five years later!,"I was twelve years old when this film came out in 1985.Since then it has remained one of my favorite movies.I originally had the Wang Chung soundtrack on LP and scratched it up so much I had to buy another one.Eventually got it on cd and now mp3.I am very happy to see so many others out there that have not forgotten this gem from the 80's.As most have said,this movie is the most underrated movie of the 80's.It's passed the test of time with flying colors."
5,to live and die in l.a.,if only all your movies were the clear. great great great. thank you very much
3,not a 5 star - but good,"I give it a solid 3-3.5 star movie. Good rental - I bought the Blu-Ray, but one watch is good enough for me. The people giving this 5 stars need to get out and watch more movies."
4,Along with French Connection's and Bullit's Car Chases!!,"A pure cult classic......I have not seen this movie since the late 80's on a bad copy, from when I taped it on HBO....Point?? well, I was not keen on seeing it in the movie, how I wish I did. Great art feel, great soundtrack, and of course, the most vivid and exciting car chase to memory....No awards here, but then? what do awrds mean anyhow...should be re-released"
4,Non-stop action with great soundtrack.,"This film, although not well known, is a powerful story of a Secret Service agent out for revenge. It has plenty of action, a great car chase scene, and unexpected turns. The soundtrack by Wang Chun is awesome and worthy of purchase on its own. I highly recommend this film to action/adventure fans who crave something different."
4,To Live and Die in L.A.,"Decent actors/acting with a believable story of counterfeiters makingand passing their product. Great auto chase scene without a childishaspect. Cold, brutal, heartless criminals within their own world anddealing with each other in that same manner. Just short of 'classic'."
4,"A classic, missunderstod?","Few remeber this classic gangsterepos and here it is one hell of a blackbuster film, a top dog starring Willem Dafoe and William Petersen and directed by William Friedkin it's rare little masterpiece, enjoy!Lars Quick, Malmo Sweden."
5,Hallelujah! TLADILA is finally on DVD!,"To Live and Die in L.A. is one of the most memorable of all movies from the 80's and one of the best cop films ever made! Friedkin directed this and THE cop film of the 1970's: The French Connection.As is required in any great cop film there is the ubiquitous car chase scene. This one does not disappoint. Imagine going the wrong way on Santa Monica Blvd. AT RUSH HOUR!William Peterson (of now CSI fame) makes possibly his most marked role of the 1980's in this film. As his partner, John Pankow (of Mad About You) creates a antithesis to Peterson's character. Both play Secret Service agents on the case of a counterfeiter - Willam Dafoe.I don't want to give away more than should be, so RENT, BUY, or BORROW this film - but see it!"
5,Excellent service,"When I placed this order for my small bible study class, i was rewarded with 1 free copy for each three ordered. What a wonderful surprise!"
5,God's Word is finally easing my fear,"I never expected fear to overwhelm me, but it had become a constant nagging doubt that I could not overcome in my own strength. This book, through the power of God's Word in Psalm 91, has given me the key to banish the fear. This booked helped me to grab on to God's promises, to repeat them to myself and to finally begin to believe in the core of my being. It isn't just reading the book - it is saying God's Word out loud, believing it and watching it in action. Read the book and do the workbook, keep the Psalm present in your mind; God's Word will heal you, protect you and enable you. I recommend it to everywhere in a risky situation - life!"
5,Peggy Joyce Ruth is an awesome author!,"I wanted to know what I could trust as far as God's umbrella of protection; exactly what the title says. You will find out if you read this book, as it satisfied my curiosity!"
1,Very typical Serrie. HIs Christmas music album,"If you don't do Christmas and would like to be bored and put to sleep, this CD is for you"
4,"Good Job at an ""Alternative"" Christmas Sound","If you dislike space/planetarium music, this CD is NOT for you. If your idea of Christmas music is ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock"", don't buy it. However, if you think Christmas is a quiet, contemplative time of reflection, thanks, and wonder, give this CD a try and enjoy."
2,Hit&Miss Film,this film dealt with alot of Social Issues&while it has some solid Acting it leaves some spots in between.still it's a interesting film when all things are clicking.
2,....boring,This movie was very boring and I dint follow the plot at all. I love seeing white men and black women together thats the main reason I watched it.
4,Great Movie----- A Must See!!!!,"I would have given it five stars, but in some spots the movie went off base. It is generally an excellent film. The entire cast fit their roles perfectly. Elise Neal and Adrien Brody were the perfect couple. Malcolm Jamal Warner was pretty impressive himself. This film was humorous, charming and sensuous. The director did an excellent job. At times I felt like I was actually in the restaurant with the cast. Rarely do you see a film that incoporates real life situations with a flawless script. One of the most believable films I've ever seen. A great cast, excellent script, and pleasing acting. You can't get better than Restaurant these days."
4,I am a sucker for a good independent movie!,"Don't they just seem to have more flava :~). Well in my opinion, this no different. This well rounded cast makes for a nice ensemble in a resteraunt setting. It is really neat to see how each of the primary characters deal with their aspirations, hidden demons and lost loves.Adrian Brody is really good in this movie. He plays his characters complexities very well. I would really like to see him in more upcoming movies. Malcolm Jamal-Warner is great as well as Elise Freeman. It is definitely worth a look-see. Again, I am a sucker for a good independent film, so you may say I am biased ;~). See it for yourself and you be the judge."
4,"So far, so good...","I bought these rotors because of Brembo's reputation and paired them with Hawk HPS pads. I was disappointed to see that they are made in China, wtf? So far they are good but I haven't put on 1000 miles even them yet. I also have changed my driving style to try to save them from warping which is always my problem. I will try to report back if I have any problems, but so far so good."
2,OK (ish),"This printer has worked well for me for the past year. However it started developing a print issue wehre it would screw up some of the image information. I initially thought that it was due to me running a faster computer and the USB information was being sent too fast to the printer. Ie under-run issues on the printer itself due to lack of memory or processing horsepower. I bought an additional memory and it still does the same thing. Basically the printer has died for some reason and I'm not too happy about this. I expect to be able to print for a long time and just have to buy consumables (ie toner etc).I'm going to ditch this printer and get some more reliable brand. HP or something similar. I don't want to have to deal with unreliable stuff as I need to print professional quality documents. Won't be buying a Samsung, that's for sure!"
1,"bad output, no photo printing.....OF NO USE!!!","i urgently needed a laser colour printer and found this one rather cheap. although i wasnt satisfied with its performance, like fuzzy text etc. i still kept on using it. but then the problems seemed to attract my attention.the major drawback which i found out in a few days time was that it doesnt print photos on photo or glossy paper!!! i tried every sort of paper and the result was rubish!!..it doesnt even have the option of glossy paper, which really shocked me!!!i didnt even use the printer much and the screen started flashing 'insert cyan toner'!!...but i found a trick for controlling that...which meant that the toner doesnt actually finish!!i also experienced the bad transparencies' printing, and was really disappointed. seriously, this printer seemed larger than life... it really made me regret its buying!! Im giving it a star only coz the review required this field to be filled!!!otherwise, two words,..DONT BUY!!"
1,Stay away from this printer!,"We received this as a gift from Samsung for our school. I can see why they were wanting to get rid of them! We have had multiple problems with the toner indicator saying that the bottle is full when it isn't even close. The problem is that the sensors are defective from the factory, even though Samsung won't admit to any wrong doing. A serviceman for Samsung said he has replaced dozens of these sensors and the problem magically goes away...Do a Google search on ""samsung clp-500 problems"" and you can read away all you want on why you should steer away from this printer, including why cost per page is excessive, as it counts the number of pages to tell you when it is out of toner, not by the amount of toner actually left. When you get the out of toner msg, you have no choice but to replace the expensive toner assy."
4,I bought One After Looking many Times,I have been going to my local electroncs store many times and looked at all the laser printers on the display. I had see this model on sale/off sale and with a rebate ect... I almost bought it a few times after demo-ing it at the store.. Finally I just Put It In My Cart and took it home. I Dont think it was a mistake at all... I would recomend it...
3,For history types,"This is an interesting book, but it has little to do with real building techniques. It mainly focuses on the social structure of the building community, which is well documented thru guild membership rosters. Not a page turner!"
3,True Story,Disturbing thing about this movie that its based on a true story and the real doctors name is Dr John Schneeberger from South Africa i believe. In real life he continuinly(sp.) raped his 15yr old stepdaughter with that same sedative he used on Estella Warren's character. Ofcourse they don't show that in the movie. Its a decent movie some scenes were a little overacted but still enjoyable.
3,Feels like a made for tv special,"I Accuse is about a accusation of rape against a doctor by a patient. The movie suffers from an after school, lifetime movie of the week, which doesnt mean it was bad. It's just not that great, but it still manages to hold your attention. As far as Canadian films are concerned, I Accuse is not great."
5,Stop shopping-buy this book!,"Tired of taking advice from friends and family on how to get pregnant and wondering why everyones ""day 14 ovulation"" theory wasnt working for me- I bought this wonderful fact-filled, fascinating, easy to read book. The next month I got pregnant, and am expecting my 1st child in 6 mos. TRUST ME, THIS BOOK IS THE BEST TO BUY IF YOU ARE TIRED OF ""TRYING!"" Or if you just want to understand the female body and how it really works. I'm living proof!"
5,ALL MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED AT LAST!,"What a wonderful book! All of my questions were answered, the basal body temperature was explained, and we are rapidly charting for conception! Better than any other fertility book I've read!"
5,What an excellent book!! A must have for all women,"This book is amazing! I highly recommend this book to all women even if you think you understand everything about your cycle. You will learn so much from this well written and easy to understand book. Whether you use it to try to get pregnant OR to prevent a pregnancy, it is a very helpfull source of information. For those who want to prevent a pregnancy this book tells you how to monitor your cycle so that you will know when it is safe to have intercourse or NOT. For those who would like to achieve a pregnancy this is a must have!! I tried for two months and BINGO!! I believe that this book helped me to understand the chances of getting pregnant and helped optimize my chances too."
3,Very informative,I thaught this book was very well written and informative. The book is very easy to read and understand. A lot of good information. I will try some of her ideas and we will see how effective it truly is.
3,not quite right,"am a little sceptical about the stories highlighted in the book - they don't seem real to me. Otherwise, it's an excellent read, but I am not pregnant yet."
3,Fast Service,"This product was almost perfect, I purchase this item used but no where did it state that the pages had yellow highlighter on them from the previous owner, other than that item arrived pretty quick!"
2,Disappointing,"I hoped this book would help me get pregnant, after more than a year of trying, but there was almost nothing in it that I didn't already know. Sometimes there's just no fertility to take charge of, I guess. I find it kind of scary that so many women apparently don't know how to figure out when they're fertile and infertile without reading books like this. My grade nine health class learned this stuff."
1,Wish she would get to the point,"I was looking for another form of birth control and bought this book. Knowing that the withdrawal method was risky, I hoped that this book could give me clear instruction on charting and the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM). Instead, the majority of this book is anecdotes, rather than clear and concise information.I am left wondering if FAM has too many variables or if Toni Wechsler is incapable of explaining it. THIS BOOK WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANY USEFULL INFORMATION IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT FAM AS BIRTH CONTROL. I have no doubt that if I followed the ""instructions"" in the book I would get pregnant eventually (assuming there were no fertility issues.)"
1,"If you're having fun, you're not doing it right","If you're looking for a way to turn the exciting and romantic prospect of conceiving into a clinical examination of temperatures and cervical fluids, this is the book for you. Check your cervical fluid three times a day! Focus on its *quality*! Dry, sticky, creamy, slippery? Focus on your vaginal sensations during the day! Don't have fun, this is a baby you're trying to make here!And don't forget the ancedote about Vanessa and Max. You're ovulating, but your husband just had surgery, is filled with painkillers and sex is the last thing on his mind? Tell him you can take care of things yourself, and force yourself on him!"
5,I wish I had learned this in school!,"Learning about my body has always been interesting. When I began to TTC, I also became more and more frustrated about the outlook of having a baby. After reading this book I became knowledgeable and hopeful again. As an educator it would be fantastic if every female and male could read and discuss this book. If I could rate this book with 10 stars, I would."
5,A MUST FOR ANYONE EXPERIENCING FERTILITY DIFFICULTIES!,My husband and I were trying (unsuccessfully) to get pregnant when we bought this book. We used the techniques and were pregnant within a month after reading the book. Ms. Weschler provides detailed information that is easy to understand. She also provides information dealing with all types of fertility issues. A must for anyone trying to get pregnant!
5,Its more than just getting pregnant.,Using the information in this book I found that I have a very regular 51 day cycle. This helped me when I was trying to get pregnant. But I also new right away when I was and was able to calculate my due date correctly which of course my doctors didn't. My husband and I also knew why it took us 8 months to get pregnant. Because I ovulate less often and have very little cervical fluid. Armed with that information we knew to just keep on trying and we would succeed. Which of course we did. I love this book and recommend it for any one who is trying to avoid or become pregnant. As well as people trying to demystify the female cycle. I really love this bood.
5,THE BEST AND EASIET,"This book is so wonderful. I bought this book for information on preventing getting pregnant. I already have 2 kids. This book is wonderful. It is so imformative. I have been following this method and nothing else for over a year now. And, I am not pregnant. This book teaches so much about your body, that even if your not interested in the program, you will have learned so much. This is a must have."
5,It worked for me,"I read this book right before I went off the pill. Two months later I was pregnant. The book is very informative about a woman's cycle and how to chart your own cycle. It really worked for me. I was able to tell that I didn't ovulate my first month of being off the pill, and I knew when I ovulated the next month (and got pregnant!). By charting my cycle I felt like I had a least some control in trying to get pregnant. I only used the section of the book for getting pregnant so I don't really know about it's use as birth control. I think it would make me nervous to rely on a charting method if I really didn't want to be pregnant."
5,Amazing Knowledge,I have learned so much about my body. I recomend this book to anyone who wants to understand your body more. I have used it as a birth control guide. I love not having the side effects of birth control and the anxiety of questioning if we should be using protection. My husband has also learned so much about me as well.I know it will also be an advanteage to know now what I know when we do plan to have kids.
5,The best book for women who want to understand their bodies.,"An absolutely wonderful book, not just for women, but for men as well, to be able to realize and understand the changes a woman's body undertakes, not only monthly, but over her lifetime. A great book for those who are trying to get pregnant. A definate MUST read."
1,"Those with known infertility problems, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","Thank goodness I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't waste my money on it! Nothing in the book was new to me, it was all info I had already learned from my (male) doctor. (They're actually not all clueless like this book implies.) This book is geared for people who have absolutely no problems with infertility and just want to know how to time things correctly. It is NOT for people with actual fertility problems."
5,"A must for women! So much we need to know, taught simply.","Ignorance is not bliss. The questions written on a piece of paper that I always brought to the many different physicians that the many different insurance companies sent me to, were finally answered in this book, simply and concisely with understanding and compassion. I actually couldn't put it down! Do not take all these positive reviews lightly. It's a wonderful feeling to finally understand the body's functions. I have a renewed spirit about the human body - it is truly miraculous - and i'm not religious!"
5,Turns the light on!,"I thoroughly recommend anyone trying to conceive to read this book. Many women would attest to this. This book gave detailed explanatations of what happens each cycle, and how to accurately chart fertility signs (basal body temperatures, cm and cp) to accurately predict ovulation. My husband and are not pregnant yet (just started trying this month!) but after charting my temperatures for 3 months, I know exactly when I ovulate, and when I should try for a baby. In addition, it will always keep you from taking expensive pregnancy tests because you will know if you are pregnant by your temperature.This is a must read!"
5,Knowledge is the key to LIFE!!!,"As a highly educated woman, I could not believe how much I did not know about my own reproductive system. After losing my period for a year due to a very stressful (ex-) job right when I wanted to start a family, this book helped me put this confusing and emotionally painful ordeal into perspective. When my period suddenly returned in Feb this year, we decided to try Toni's method for pregnancy this month- unbelievably, I just found out a baby is on the way for Christmas!! Thanks Toni for helping the sun shine again!!"
5,REQUIRED READING,We got pregnant immediately after following the guidelines in this book. You really will take control of your own fertility. This book should be in all gyn/ob-gyn waiting rooms.
5,What A Blessing,"My husband and I have been trying to conceive for a year with no success. It seems we have obstacles on both sides, but this book has given me so much hope and inspiration! As irregular as my cycles may be, I know exactly when to expect ovulation to occur. The charting methods in this book have put me soooo in touch with my body, that I feel like my own physician. I can tell if I have an infection, I always know when I am ovulating, and soon I hope I will be able to confirm a pregnancy based solely on my temperature. This book is truly a blessing for us and hopefully for many other couples struggling with infertility."
5,"FAM is the best ""not-talked-about"" birth control available!",Taking Charge of Your Fertility gave me the information I needed to feel confident in going off The Pill without getting pregnant. The book was easy to read and explained in detail how the FAM method works. Definitely a must-read book for every woman who only knows what the doctors have told her about her reproductive system.
3,Still Trying,"This is a good read and easy to understand, but by no means the answer to conception for everyone."
5,Fertility 101 at your fingertips,"Forget using the book just to achieve pregnancy. This book should be a must read for ALL women of childbearing years. In fact, I have a spare copy I bought just in case it goes out of print, so I have one for my daughter who was conceived using it! Whether trying to conceive, avoiding pregnancy, or just learning about how the female body works, this is an invaluable source of information. Great pictures, easy to read information, and useful resources listed. A wonderful companion for Lifecyclesoft charting software."
5,Worth it's weight in gold!,"I was having trouble conceiving our first child and was, like anyone, worried that maybe I would be unable to have children. I found this book at a bookstore and read it cover to cover in one night. I did everything it told me to do (putting aside anxiety and dignity!) and I conceived on the first chart. I had 30 high temperatures and thought--no way! I took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I would pay $1000 for this book if I had to because now i have 2 beautiful children."
5,Toni should write a book for teen girls,"This is the best book on the female reproductive system that I have ever read, and it is the only one that anyone needs to read. Every woman should read this book, whether they want to get pregnant or prevent it. If only we were taught precisely this information when we were teenagers! The author really must write a book for adolescent girls."
5,"Better than OUR BODY, OURSELVES","This is an excellent book that every woman of menstruating age should read. It explains, clearly and simply (and without political jargon!), how a woman's cycle works. Understanding your fertility can help women avoid pregnancy, and can help them get pregnant quickly when they decide the time is right for a baby. An excellent resource."
5,What They Should Have Told Us When We Were 10,"Toni Weschler's book, Taking Charge of Your Fertility, was extremely informative in learning about the changes that take place cyclically within my body. I wish someone had told me when I was 10. A must have book for every woman."
4,I didn't realise there was so much I didn't know!,"Overall this is the most informative book I have ever read on the subject of fertility. Easy to read, understand and put into practise... everything everyone should know in one book. BRILL !!"
5,"A book every women should own, conceiving or not conceiving!","I had heard about charting my cycles from friends online. I had a miscarriage in January and was wanting to try again. After 4 months I borrowed this book from the library and after reading, knew I had to own my own copy. Whether you are trying to conceive or not, you need this book. I have learned so much about my body and when I need to try to conceive. The first cycle we tried, after reading this book, we tested positive. But by charting my cycles and with the help of this book, I knew three days before, that I was again going to miscarry. The book told me the signs. I am now trying again this cycle, with hopes that I can carry this one. But if it were not for this book, I would still be in the dark as to why I can't get pregnant. It is all in the timing. I recommend this book to everyone I know that is trying to conceive or having fertility problems. They may not be problems at all! Thank you Toni!"
5,Hooray! Reliable natural birth control at last!,This book's amazingly clear text demistifys the female reproductive cycle. I loved it! Anyone looking for an alternative birth control strategy or curious about really understanding female fertility will be excited to read this book cover to cover! Schools should teach this information!!! Parents should pass it on!!!
4,Winter Prep for Seniors,"My goal in selecting Tire Pressure Valve Caps, was to keep consistent check on the pressure in my tires, without having to kneel down with a tire pressure guage. Each day I simply have to stand next to each tire and view for any color change! It is quick, easy and efficient and good for my tires as well as gas consumption. I would say that most senior citizens and women need this tool. Applause to the inventor of this necessary measuring device."
1,Same leakage problem,"I had the same leakage problem as Micah on two different sets. In both situations only one of the four caps had significant leakage, but in both cases it was bad enough to drop 10 psi in a week."
1,Don't Buy,"These valve caps (and others like them) will result in leakage that simultaneously create pressure problems while displaying visual false positives.Tire Pressure caps are a great idea but are not as sensitive as factory Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems and will eventually cause avoidable problems (as described by other reviewers here).In short Tire Pressure Caps, as currently designed and conceived, are NOT ready for prime time. Save your money and your piece of mind."
1,Cheap-made and useless product,"I bought set of them in Walmart and thought I got a useful little things. Not at all, I threw them away the same day. Reason? They really bad calibrated. They supposed to work on cars with 32 psi tire pressure, and to show red when pressure going under 27 psi. So, I inflated all my tires exactly to 32 psi with electric inflator with built-in gauge, and only 1 of 4 caps showed me green color. One more was between red and green, and 2 were red, and I got them to be green only by inflating tires to 34 psi. So, you see, it's useless. I don't want to see red mark when my tires properly inflated or just a little bit underinflated. On the top of it in manual it was warning that you should replace them to usual aps before going to high-pressure car washing, and that cold emperature in the winter can affect their work. Seriously? They didn't work even in normal circumstances, not talking about winter or car wash. Don't even waste you money."
1,Break easily,I bought these for my 2007 matrix and had them on the car for about 2 months when I noticed one of the clear plastic caps was missing. It appears to have broken off the rest of the part and exposed the colored gauge. For the price it wouldn't buy these again.
2,Review for Absentia,"I think it's common practice for people associated with a film--either firsthand or by way of family or friend--give glowing reviews to a movie for the purpose of suckering people into buying/renting it. I can't imagine anyone giving this piece of crap any more than two stars. It was terrible. Bad acting, weak story, a ""monster"" we never really see. Very low budget. Don't let the cover image fool you. It is the only thing associated with this movie that's worth looking at. View at your own risk."
2,For Lovecraft Fans?...Hardly!,"I just watched this movie and I was curious to see some of the reviews because, after all, maybe I missed something.I know now that I didn't. What gets me is that people are comparing this to something Lovecraft might've done. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan and not once did I think of Lovecraft while watching this. I don't want to give anything away but yes there is a creature(we really never see it except in the blurry distance). What it is and what the hell it's doing is never really explained. Are there more than one of them? Dunno? The best way I can describe this movie is that the director may have had the germ of a cool idea somewhere in there but lacked the funds to carry it through. And therein lies a warning to any budding filmmaker with a minimal budget. Work within your budget otherwise you have a movie like this with a lot of filler dialogue, 0 special effects(which it needed), and poor screenplay(written by the director)."
4,Well Done,"I thought this movie was very good. I found myself quickly caring about the characters and pulled into their lives. I am very picky about what I spend my time watching, and always read the reviews, so I thought it only fair to leave one myself. This was well worth watching. The story was well written and the acting was very good. I like a good mystery. I don't like gratuitous violence and gore, and this movie was quite scary without all that junk. I know some of you like that kind of thing, but I am much more impressed when a ""horror"" movie can stand on it's on, with a low budget, no special effects, no gore, but just an intelligent story line and great direction. If you like supernatural films with a good story line and decent acting, I think you will like this."
3,Absentia,"I found to movie to be imaginative,written well despite sometimes lack of development and dialogue,and except for the scene regarding a fetus (Offensive)and regarding the cute pregnant girl,I thought the movie was good.It could have been a lot more scarier than You would imagine by the cover,seems a little simple at times;and you ask why are they so stupid?just move out,ultimately you'll have all the answers by the end of the movie even if they don't make sense."
3,the title is appropriate as the creature is absent from this film,Possible Spoiler but not really. This was a decent flick. It kept my interest. The spoiler I mentioned is the fact that I will say that the creature is absent from this film. You never actually get to see it. I guess the budget didn't allow for that I don't know. Made it feel it was missing something after it was over. It was 3 stars with the budget considered.
3,Interesting but falls flat,"Interesting little film but sadly it falls very flat. Its shot in such a way that it reminds me too much of videos we made in high school for instance.I loved the overall idea behind the film but it leaves out too many great possibilities. I would have loved to see more of the ""creature"" and less time on still frames of characters, cops lookin' smug or people whining and being sad."
4,VITARE CUNICULUM,"What a little gem of a horror movie! This was nothing like I expected, was better than ninety percent of horror movies I've seen at the cinema in the last couple of years (and,yes, I'm including you, Cabin In The Woods)and was made on a miniscule budget.Without giving in to too many spoilers, let's say there is nothing predictable about these women's predicaments. A woman comes to help her sister declare her brother-in-law's death due to absentia as he's been missing for seven years. But what's going on with the subway pedestrian tunnel in the park nearby?The last scene is one you won't forget in a hurry. Frightening, clever and very dark."
4,Major Studio Heads Should See This,"I saw this based on a recommendation from my brother, who is into movies although not as much as I am; after seeing this, I am glad I listened to him. My gripe against most big ""horror"" movies is that they are wall-to-wall gorefests which are excuses for the special effects crew to show off while any plot and characterization go right out the window; this movie did not fall prey to that mistake.In this movie it kept the focus on where it should be, on the characters and the story while keeping the special effects to a minimum. There were a few scary moments, but mostly the film worked on creating an atmosphere of menace, which was doubly effective given the urban setting. The major movie studios need to take note; this is how you make a scary movie."
1,Save yourself,"After I watched this movie, Satan rose from hell and told me I had to either watch it again or he would have AIDS rape my mouth. I now have AIDS and I don't regret my decision."
4,Good film,Low budget but don't let that keep you away. It's well done and pretty creepy. Good acting and well written.
4,A Genuinely Scary Movie....,"Very Creepy and OriginalI really liked Absentia. This modern horror movie uses tension and creepy imagery to create an original vision. Some may dislike the slow pacing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.What did I like? Absentia uses the slow pace to tell a fairly original story and create a tense setting. I didn't expect most of the scares and got some goosebumps during others. It didn't need gore or loud music to scare. This movie is genuinely scary! The ending was also good. And I also liked the music.What did I dislike? Some forced/poor dialogue. Some mediocre acting. Also, Absentia loses some steam towards the second half; there aren't as many scares and it generally wasn't as great as the first half.If you love horror films, especially slow paced creepers, you'll most likely enjoy Absentia. If you have Netflix Streaming, it available as of 7/10/12. I highly recommend it.Absentia has some violence and gore. No sex or nudity.*Originally posted on DVD version"
4,Creepy Horror Indie,"This is a well made micro-budget horror movie. Mike Flanagan creates a very creepy atmosphere and pulls off a couple of decent scares and his story is more interesting than the average slasher movie. Yes is extremely low budget but looks great, and some of the actors are not pretty Hollywood types but this is what makes the movie so effective."
4,Don't be Fooled by the Cover Art!,"Absentia is NOT the run-of-the-mill weekly horror release. The cover art on the box may make you think to bypass or rent this, but I urge anyone with a taste for creepy horror and H.P. Lovecraft to purchase this ASAP. I, along with so many lucky others, experienced this creepy, get-under-your-skin horror tale at a film festival and we were blown away. It's a great high concept story expertly translated with a minimal budget. The effects are terrifying at times while cast and crew deliver a nightmarish vision that may make you keep the lights on for weeks. I suggest blasting this through your audio system to get the full effect that will have you jumping out of your skin."
4,Exceeded My Expectations,"I watched this movie on Netflix. The cover art reminded me of the ending of Quarantine, so I skipped past it time and time again. I finally decided to watch it tonight, and I was literally blown away. First and foremost, it is a slow burner, not action-packed. It builds tension gently and creepily, especially when the protagonist begins to see visions of her missing ex-husband. What really takes this movie over the top is the acting. I was amazed at how talented the entire cast was in making a strange tale so believable. Part of what I think really appealed to me -- and made my skin crawl -- was the setting. I used to live in San Diego, and the tunnel featured in this film was familiar, reminding me of my own experiences walking past homeless men and women, holding my breath until I arrived at the other end. The tone of the movie also reminded me of a 90s movie called ""Urbania."" If you are into ""creepy"" rather than ""scary"" movies, this one might appeal to you."
2,Waste of time. Have more fun watching water boil,"What a dud. I only gave it 2 stars because everyone tried so hard to make a movie that did not stink but really it comes closer to a one star. They failed for the most part. The plot was awful. Spoiler alert. A bug takes people into walls and keeps them there 7 years and they come back once in a while not too much worse off. Same clothes, no real weight loss, all in all not bad for living with a bug in the wall. Really? Then get this, sometimes it takes them back again. It does not get much worse than this plotwise. You gotta buy an awful lot and even if you buy this nonsense all in all I just did not care one way or another."
5,Outstanding horror film.,Great movie. Great plot. Great acting. The editing is a bit choppy and the pacing is a bit slow in places. It is a real thinking persons movie. Creepy in places and totally engrossing. The movie pulls you in from the start. I am glad I watched this one. If you like scarey movies with a bit of a twist this one is for you.
1,stupid,it was very stupid i want my money back.dissapointed no doubtdont waste your time. i meen it nono no
1,Why do I keep doing this?,"I continue to evaluate Amazon viewers reviews and if I have a gut feeling I will rent a movie based on those reviews. I have NEVER gotten a ""winner"" yet from that practice and this movie, Absentia, is the last.NOTHING HAPPENS.......I lost interest long before I was 30 minutes into the movie. Avoid this please or......do what I would now do and rent it based on my review.Its a nightmare of an existance we live in."
1,Disappointing and Slow,This movie was not scary or even close to frightening. It was extremely slow and took way too long to reveal anything close to being considered horror. Find another move!
1,Weak,"Watched the first 20 minutes, I am now looking for a new movie, the five star review was written by one of the actors, probably the girl who runs everyday and never loses weight."
5,This CD is a hidden gem. Band deserves wider recognition.,"Download the MP3 if you can. I was blown away on the first listen. Imagine an amulgation of Michael Schenker-era UFO, Argus-era Wishbone Ash, early Rush, and some NWOBHM influences and you have Winterhawk. Now take into account that this album was recorded a few years before the NWOBHM explosion and on this side of the Atlantic, and you can see that this band was possibly ahead of their time and geographically displaced for what should've been huge success. This album abounds with great guitar work and performances. Even production for this era of a live album doesn't disappoint. Glad I found this. It's albums like this that deserve wider recognition in classic rock circles."
5,Chilton Repair Manual,Has been a great help in diagosiing and making repairs on our multiple Rodeos...We ordered and received the manual in about 4 days. Saved us a lot of time and money.
5,"Great Guide for the ""Home Mechanic""","Haynes Manuals are amazing.they are written based on a complete tear-down and rebuild of most cars.The manuals include routine maintenance procedures, liquid capacities and torque specs; all the good stuff."
3,not detailed enough.,"It's fine for the mechanical stuff, but i have many niggling irritants inside the cab, such as back seat latches and the shoulder strap slider track...."
2,pre-101 level,"if information like ""studies suggest exercising helps you live longer and better"" is new and helpful to you, then this book is as good as any. I only made through the first half of this before giving up as a waste of time, so I stand open to correction from somone that struggled through the entire thing, but there was simply no there there. No new insights or interesting research studies in this. I could have written this book, and I have no expertise whatsoever in this field."
5,Bad Girls Of Peach,"All the women on this dvd are just insanely hot but, my favorite is Tylene Buck she is just drop dead gorgeous and she could give a dead man a major pants tent love her look and the way she moves her sizzling curves she just knows how to play to the camera aka make love to it and if she was a police officer she could arrest me anytime woooooo good god!"
3,Pretty and Functional,"I like this teapot, but if you're in a hurry to heat your water, you might want to consider a different pot. I think the gauge of the metal is such that it simply takes longer to heat the water ( a good 15-20 minutes for a full pot). Also, if you fill the pot close to the top, the water will spill down the spout when you pour. Otherwise, it is a very durable and pretty pot and overall I am pleased with this teapot!"
3,The whistle is a disappointment,"The pot it's self looks very nice in the kitchen, but the whistle is a big disappointment. I ordered the pot because of the whistle. I like to put the water on and then do other thigs while it is heating and I rely on the whistle to let me know when the water is ready. The hum from the pot is so low you have to be standing next to it to hear it. The last pot I had, the whistle was so loud you could hear it if you anywhere in the house. So if you are looking for a pot that you need to count on hearing the whistle I would not recommend buying this pot. It looks from the reviews I have read that others feel the same way. I hope the company will fix the feature."
3,Not quite,"I bought the kettle a year ago and it is not quite as I expected. It looks great and that was my initial motive for buying it, but -1. The gentle whistling sound I expected was like an emergency alarm. I am a tea drinker so are my friends, and over the holidays I had them over. Well, the alarm went off, the teakettle that is, and they all stopped conversing trying to figure out what went wrong, while I and my husband who heard it from another room, rushed to the kitchen. It is so pretty and I just wanted to use it on occasion, but that wasn't a good idea, was it? Anyway, the kettle was a great conversional piece for the party.2. The lid is very tight and you have to be very careful not to drop the whole thing trying to open it.Having said that, and to be fair, the kettle looks great and has a sturdy construction."
4,"The best for slow thyroid function, and Hashi.",Good product. Mailed pretty fast. I make sure to take 2 tablets a day. I like it. Good brand and good price.
3,Selenium 100 mcg,A normal mineral/vitamin supplement. Price was reasonable so decided to try it. I haven't seen any difference from my usual brand.
2,A disappointment,"I have read all six of the Nina Reilly stories. This is by far the weakest. A lot of it is predictable. There are coincidences which are just hard to fathom.... for example, a gemologist showing up to testify in court at the very instant the defense is about to give up on him. (It was almost a Perry Mason moment!)There were some surprises... why the air crash happened, what happened to the deadbeat dad..... but mostly things played out as expected. I think that the authors' first two books.... Move to Suppress and Invasion of Privacy were great. I'm sorry that the series has taken a downturn."
5,Move to Strike was Excellent!,"This is my first review. I will not go into detail on the storyline.For those familiar with Nina Reilly, I believe this was her best!! I could not put the book down. I enjoyed the other books in the series, but the character development was richer than before.For those unfamiliar with Nina Reilly, this is the sixth mystery of the series in the surroundings of Lake Tahoe. Unfortunately I am one of those readers that has to start with book one. So start reading and enjoy."
3,Move to Strike,"The book was okay, it was not one of her best, but certainly not the worst.I like the authors books that have the lawyers from East Coast as the characters."
3,Good reference but too combersome,"I felt like the Samsad English-Bengali Dictionary is a good reference, for a very serious student of the language, but at the same time, for those who are on a basic or intermediate level with the language, it is a bit of overkill. It gives so much information, that it is difficult to get to the heart of the matter. So, it may be useful, but trying to figure out the meaning of words in this book I found difficult, having only a basic understanding of the language. They give too many definitions, and you end up missing the point of the basic definition."
4,Automotive Electrical Systems,I use Halderman's book as the primary source in automotive electrical training in a classrom setting. ASE study guides are good for revue but presume knowledge of the subject. OEM training materials that I have used are either too basic (Mister Electron) or too specific (GM CS alternators).
2,Below par.,"This book has many small editing errors throughout. Some pages are not numbered.A large percent of the photos are sub-standard in quality(Bad lighting and much too cluttered to see exactly what is being ref. in the text. See pages 472-474 and many others.)I think the Index is very poor. (As an example the word KNOCK is not included!)Many other important subjects are not included as well. Remote door locks are not adequately covered.Many of the glossary items only tell what an entry means, not what it does or how it fits into the system, or where it is covered in the book.The workbook suffers from some of the same problems as above but in addition has some plain lacking/wrong/improper instructions.The CD-ROM does not expand on the book to any great extent. Its videos do not show any engine applications at all. Only vary basic use of a V/A meter. The CD-ROM waveforms are not accompanied with any audio or text so it is hard to know what you are looking at and why."
1,workbook,This appears to be a workbook for a class?? Not made entirely clear through the explanation. I subsequently returned it.
5,A girl escape the war torn south only to find more disaster.,"When Emma, her older brother, and her younger sister left their home behind to seek refuge with their relatives in St. Louis, they thought they had left the worst of the destruction wrought by the Civil War behind. And they have. However, on board the Sultana, a paddle wheel boat headed up the Mississippi River, they find a new terror when the boat explodes and catches fire. Separated from their brother, Emma and her little sister must stay alive and find a way off the burning boat. An action-packed survival story filled with historical details."
3,pretty good,"These were what I expected - nice, shiney brass. What I didn't expect was that there would only be two in the package. The (3) after the item name : ""Bright Brass(3) Cup Hook"" led me to believe that there would be three of them in the package. For this reason I was not totally satisfied. Perhaps this was just a minor error and can be remedied easily."
4,Nice watch,Nice looking watch and I liked the glow in the dark buttons. Note the watch must be exposed to light previously in order to glow. The band was nice but I bought a twist-o-flex band(also from Amazon) since I like that style.My only wish is that it had the WaveCeptor(automatic atomic setting) like my previous Casio. Casio doesn't make calculator watches with WC anymore.
3,Keys & beep problems,"My previous model, the one without the glow-plastic keys was MUCH easier to use. The keys on this one are incredibly hard to press without using a stylus of some sort. I've been using my pocket screwdriver lately.Also, the beep is not loud enough to wake me up, as the previous one was. Casio apparently cannot do anything about that, either.A feature that I wish it had would be a way to back up the data, so that, if necessary, it could be transferred from an old one to a new one. Mini or micro-USB? Probably make it cost too much..."
5,I love this watch.,"When I was recalled to active duty during Desert Shield/Storm my husband gave me a watch like this. It was 20 years old and I thought it was loosing some of its pixels. I searched for a new one and this is the one I got. It is just like my old one with one exception, the alarm sound is not as loud. I had read the reviews and realized that that was a complaint that was made so I was not disappointed when I realized that it not as loud. Otherwise I am very happy with my purchase. I hope for another 20 years."
3,Casio data 1477,"It's not the watch I wanted, lack of specs. I replaced an older watch I had and it was not glowing (strongly) it had a secret password to access private data and it was water resistant I don''t know about this one. Otherwise OK."
5,CASIO DATABANK HAS SAVED ME A LOT OF TROUBLE,"Quite simply I have worn Casio Databank watches for at least 15 years. In my past and current jobs(31 years Military, including time in the sand box and now Homeland Security) I have found them to be very reliable and tough (just don't put them in water). And they have all the features and info to get me through tough situations."
3,alarm not alarming,"Purchased this watch as the third replacemnet. It has great functionality and one of the keys is that is an appointment alarm reminder. Unfortunateluy, the alarm can barely be heard. On my previous two, alarm could be heard. Saw another review last week about the same problem. Called Casio and they said they could not help me."
4,Casio DBC1500B-1,"I bought this watch for its scheduling ability. It helps keep track of birthdays, anniversaries and other important dates. The manual is a little hard to read because of its small size. Once you figure out how to enter the data, it is not too hard to use. I did not adress the durability of the watch because I have not had it long enough. I did buy the one with the metal case because it should be more durable than the plastic case. Other Casios that I have owned have lasted well. I do like the glowing keyboard. For the price it really offers a lot of features."
2,Slow and Buggy,"I found the Mac version of Master of Orion 2 to be slow and buggy. It crashes quite often, and I found the game play to be slow in real terms and in game terms. Friends who have the Windows version note only minor bugs but complain about the slow speed as well. Games like Civilization II show that you can have well-paced, gripping, yet satisfyingly complex turn-based ""exploratory"" strategy games that are virtually bug-free. Unfortunately MOO2 is not one of these."
1,super WEAK,"a WEAK excuse for a stragedy game. Yes, there's a lot to keep track of, colonies, designing ships, combat ... on the surface it looks involved and complicated, but it rots. After spending hours building your colonies and fleets, go ahead and do battle with a foe - you'll find they're 100x more powerful than you. Not an equal match. The computer 'cheats' by having no time restrictions on building fleets and refitting ships. But it takes you hundreds of turns to just refit a single ship. Single-player stragedy games must have equality among the sides. The player shouldn't have limitations that the computer controlled sides do not. Truly a big waste of time."
1,What OS are you using?,"What a great game it was until OS 9+. Then, no support and no operability! Beware!"
4,A box of drow and Drizz't thrown in!,"We're going to run through the WoTC adventure City of the Spider Queen, and so I'm preparing by painting Drow and other Underdarklings. I like the assortment in this boxed set, although I'd have thrown in a couple extra Drow soldiars and perhaps left out one of the Kuo-Tao.Also, the Drow ranger could pass as the popular Forgotten Realms character Drizz't.I had no trouble assembling the models. The Drow wizard came with a back banner that I thought looked a little silly, so I didn't attach it, and simply puttied over the small hole in the wizard's back."
2,rather dissapointing regardless where they were made...,I got these to put on a fretless 4 that i preamped & thought it would give me a really smooth soundfor a fretless. I cant say its all these strings fault but compared to the set of rounds or flats ive put on sincethere's no comparison ...personally i think they have a bad core or the coating is just too thick..you lose a tonof volume with these strings...there still sittin in the junk heap ....Personally I wouldnt waste my $ on'em :/
5,Done in the tradition of David lynch !,"Mann, I was really shocked when I watched this film. It was so dreamy and had such a lynch feel too it. If you like David Lynch movies this is definitely one everyone should check out ! Very dark and disturbing and you don't quite understand the movie until the end. There is one scene in the film where he rubs blood all over this girls breast, pretty interesting ! The movie gets better from there and much much more strange and intriguing ! Not going to give too much away but it's a winner ! A very sexy thriller as well as disturbing and interesting! It is hard to understand or comprehend though I am warning you. It is a bit of a dream sequence like Lost Highway or Mulholland DR. So if you are a fan of very surreal and unusual type of films ? I would suggest purchasing this you won't be disappointed the cinematography is excellent.A+"
3,"Good Performances, Seen it all Before","The acting was really good and the first half of the film builds up nicely but ultimately gives in to predictibility and the current plot twists we've seen in every other film the past several years.Still, if you're in the mood for a nicely executed thriller with some violent erotica thrown in, this is worth catching."
2,"""IF I WANTED A BOOTLEG I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE! """,I love Zeke but 90% of this disc sounds like s**t!
2,#1casey,"this pen did nothing but ruin my photos. i have one dog that has real green eyes and they always come out red and a grandaughter and hers always come out red. i have tried different applications, but nothing works. i didn't send them back because of the cost of postage. i would appreciate a response to this email review because maybe there is something magical i'm not doing. twyla vienneau"
2,Fails Even As A Monday Morning Quarterback,"No doubt the author, if sent back to the 1930s would have joined those carrying signs ""Scholarships Not Battleships"". That message carried the US into WW2 with a totally unprepared military. To the tens of thousands of soldiers who died in junk tanks in Europe, primitive warships in the Atlantic and antique fighters and bombers in the Pacific an apology that can never be delivered is owed.The author's failed logic leads to failed conclusions. You can do 10 years or 100 years of ""research"" but if you ignore half the data and mis-analyze the rest you still have trash."
5,Great Jigsaw Puzzles,This is great for anyone who loves jigsaw puzzles. Easy to learn and has a good selection of puzzles with various degrees of difficulty. I only wish they would make a Volume II with even more puzzles to choose from!
1,DON'T BUY IT - IT'S NOT A COMPLETE EDITION,This DVD does NOT contain the whole series. They chopped it down so that it makes no sense and the sound quality is very poor.
3,Thalia reigns! Fernando Carillo is hotter than ever!,"This dvd arrived to me as amazon promised... no doubt, ROSALINDA was my favorite mexican series... the whole story was there... my only complaint was, it was squeeze into 2 dvds (double-faced)... making you feel that you're watching a REALLY as in really fast-paced series... you won't be able to absorb the story coz the changing of the scenes were very fast.I should have love it if they make atleast 10 dvds...O well, better than none! still it's a keepstake!Fernando Carillo was the only reason why i bought the series... hahaha... but otherwise STILL i love the story and everything in it!"
3,WHY DID THEY CUT OUT SEVERAL PARTS OF THE SHOW?,"Loved the story, but why is so much cut out of the original presentation?Thalia is never shown performing (upclose), and many of these scenes are cut out all together. I was also very upset that there are no English subtitles....or any other language options. Does anyone know where I can get an English subtitled version that is actually an un-edited copy??HELP! cellphonesusie@hotmail.com"
3,A good novela and thalias last in Mexico,"If you are expecting a knock out performance by Thalia like she did in Marimar or in Maria Mercedes than this is not the novela for you. Rosalinda was good novela and had the major ingredients that encompass all of Televisa telenovelas, poor girl meets rich boy they fall in love, they get married, he leaves her over a misunderstanding, she suffers, they get divorced, he apologizes, she forgives his betrayals, in the end they get married and live happily ever after.Problem with the DVD as with many of the other novela DVDs that they are not showing the orignal theme song of the novela. I don't know if its for copyrights since some of the songs were written or sung by latino artists but that sucks. If we are paying 16.00 to 18.00 we should as the buyer get are moneys worth. I hope televisa corrects this in the future."
2,Sorry bub,"Well this soap opera is in SPANISH..not Latin. So you're out of luck there.And yes it will be subtitled in English. So enjoy the worst possible telenovela Mexico has ever made. So boring and bland..even for a Thalia soap. Mind you..this is a remake of the 1988 Venezuelan soap opera ""Primavera"" with Gigi Sanchetti....but with a much more boring plot, none of the sex and all around boring story telling and BAD acting by Thalia. Even worse than on her previous 3."
5,THE BEST TVSERIE IN THE WORLD,"ROSALINDA, IS THE BEST SOAP IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, I LOVE YOU THALIA, YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT NOW."
4,very fast shipping,I know this is a long show but many parts were removed from it. I did not like that. Was looking forward to watch it all.
1,Not complete,This dvd was so hard to follow because it had cut off.so many scenes that made.it confusing. Do not.waste your money
4,sounds great once you've actually read it,"preferably aloud, as a kind of modern scherezade, but ten times longer and a lot less one-sidedor maybe it should be set to music"
3,Young Adult level reader,"Interesting book about the ""life"" of an inkstick. It imagines the inkstick as a character and traces its life from shiny new to tattered remnant in the mud. Appears to have the flavor of a 1950's junior high school reader."
3,Not that good...,"Okay the story itself *RULES* and has INCREDIBLE potential. But the actors and actresses ruin it fully. The father's acting is especially horrible. The story is a little slow in execution - it takes the girl about five minutes to walk up the stairs and into the room! In fact, the whole first twenty-five minutes of the film are uneventful slum."
1,cool movie and scary of the liviing dead,well this movie tells us about when josh and amanda move to dark falls and the meet dead people and at they find themselfs at the end with dead people serounding the house the dead people get in there house and try to get blood from them to live for a very long time and at the end they live dark falls for a good reason . end of my review on the cool and scary movie END
5,best one yet!!!!!!!!!,this movie is good and scary way creepy! The music makes it more scary. They are all good charecters! i'm sure you will enjoy this movie so buy it! - cody tidwell
4,A easy to read book,this is a little nice book. it can be read in a week or two. even a high school student can read it and understand it. very good for a person who know little about interpersonal communication but wish to quickly obtain some high quality knowledge on this topic.
5,Devil's Claw--JA Jance,Great book by a great author. I love her writing and anyone buying her books needs to look at her website and read the books in order.
3,Likeable Characters,"I wasn't particularly interested in reading another story about a missing computer disc, but I stayed with this story because I liked the characters. There were plenty of side stories to keep interest alive while the main plot evolved. When the facts surrounding the missing disc finally are revealed, the pace picks up quite a bit. This is a fairly lightweight mystery, but the character of Sheriff Joanna Brady carries the day."
2,"SORRY JUDITH, YOU DON'T GET MY VOTE!","The bottom line: I really didn't like this book. I found the plot and action to be very slow moving and uninteresting. One thing I did like was Sheriff Brady. I thought she was a good solidly created character, but the plot just didn't have that exciting pace that a Hoag, Hooper, Johansen, or Cornwell novel does. Another thing that I didn't particulary care for was the whole eagle thing with the young girl. It kind of a gave off a somewhat ridiculous indian spirit kind of feeling. I also found it kind of unnecessary to have the part about Joanna's neighbor's death and his daughter. Of course if you are a fan of J.A. Jance, then I'm sure you'll like ""The Devil's Claw"" and these kind of ""small town"" mysteries. If you enjoy more hard-core suspense and don't like the ""country down south"" novels, then you won't like ""The Devil's Claw."
4,A very pleasant book,"This book contains three stories involving Joanna Brady, the sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona. First, we have the crime story involving an old murder, a current murder, and a runaway teenager. Second, our hero is getting married, and she must fight crime inbetween wedding preparations. Third, the daughter of her longtime neighbor comes to harass her, providing unwanted distractions from the first two stories. The entire book is a pleasant and easy read. I appreciate the fact that J. A. Jance keeps the language at the PG level - too many modern authors think they must write R rated script in order to sell books."
5,Devils claw,Loved this book. This is the second time i have read it. I do like the Joanna Brady mysteries. Enjoy
4,Devils Claw a hit,"I enjoyed the entire Joanna Brady series since I have been to almost all the places in her books. Living in S Ariz makes it fun and easy, her descriptions of places like Brewery Gulch and the Copper Queen are dead on!Stories are good too!"
2,Like watching paint dry,I have read many stories in this series but this is the worst so far. It moves along at a ponderous pace and the dialogue seems to aimed at the junior high level. The characters say things that are so obvious it often seems like little more than filler material. Most of the side-stories and about the main character's personal life which I do not find particularly interesting. This book lacks the descriptive power of a Tony Hillerman novel and there is very little information on local Indian customs which was present in other books in the series. You can skip this book and have missed very little in the series. Your time is better spent with a Lee Child book.
3,My first J.A. Jance experience,"This is the first book I read from J.A. Jance, so I'm not very familiar with her work , so I'll try to read more of her later.This book tell us the story of a Joanna Brady, a sheriff from a samll town in Arizona.It tell us the story of a murder , a missing teenager and the fight for a will , everything happens just a week before her wedding takes place.This is an ok book , it has an interesting begining with a good plot , and it is really interesting to read .It would deserve 4 stars , but I didn't like the ending , it was a very good plot and I didn't like the way it finished , but that's just my opinion.Read it , it's a good book , it's just not that great , after reading this , I'm more interested in reading more books of J.A. Jance and more about the Story of Joanna Brady."
3,4 wire flat dust cover,"Wish the LED's were brighter, I bought it to be able to test the wiring converter in my truck. As it turned out my original converter was bad and I had to replace it but it took a while to diagnose with the tiny LED's. It does function as a dust cover."
5,Work Great,works Great for anyone wanting to quickly check their trailer tail lights. I use this occasionally when Im too lazy to walk back and check trailer lights or when Im trouble shooting a trailer light issue.
4,Great testing unit,"This is a great little unit. I was trying to test to see if my harness had crapped out without attaching the trailer. It's a small unit, does the job and keeps the plug clear of debris. I keep it on 24/7."
5,This Classic Needs To Be On DVD!!,"I have loved this film from childhood and havetaped it down through the years.But in this day and age of DVD, I think it's ridiculousthat they have released all the old ""pimps & ho's""blaxploitation flicks of the late 60's and early 70's,yet are reluctant to release treaures like this oneas readily!The late Gordon Parks did an excellent job of bringinghis book (a recount of his coming of age in 1920's Kansas)to life with vivid performances by some young actorsand a few of the old school legends of that timewho were still around.It's a wonder they haven't tried to remake it withsome of the good actors of today!I've always wondered what happened to some of theactors who played in this film over the years.I think that they probably also have some greatbehind-the-scenes documentary-style footageas well, which both could make great extrason the DVD version.Bottomline, this movie is a piece of living historyand should be restored and enhanced withthe technology of today!"
5,Love this!,"This is a classic dvd and I was very happy to find it. I received the dvd in one day, and it played perfectly!Thank You!!!! Great service!!!!!"
4,The Learning Tree is a very good movie,"This is a very good emotional drama. It is about the life of a teenage boy & all of the things in his life....He has to deal with ""birds & bees"", bullying, racism, fear, death & even the feeling called ""LOVE"". It is an excellent movie."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"This could have been a great movie. I found the story interesting. The film depicts growing up as an African-American in rural Kansas of the 1920's. Unfortunately, the film is marred by a mediocre script and poor acting. This movie is a missed opportunity to take a memorable story and make of it a moving film. Instead the film falls flat."
3,Captures Sagan at his zenith,"This book is a combination of Sagans views and the history and possible future of space exploration. It's a great technical and visual compendium of exploration.The major flaw with the book are some of Sagans views. He spends a great deal of time trashing the Catholic Church for the Inquisition and it's condemnation of Galileo. His conclusion is that it's better to adopt a purpose of seeding the universe with ourselves rather than believing any fable regarding a Designer of the universe who cannot exist.Sagan becomes the die-hard worshipper of science and promotes some fables of his own. Such as careening hundreds of asteroids into Venus to terraform it. He falls into the fantasy of cheap energy as depicted in all science fiction. The facts presented in the book are solid and deep. It's Sagans opinions and flights of fancy which, had they been toned down, would have made this a great book."
3,"Politics, not Science","Make no mistake, just as Sagan reveals his opinion that Apollo 11 was about politics, not science, I tell you that Pale Blue Dot is about politics, not science. And just as it is my opinion that his book is political, it is only his opinion that Apollo 11 was political. His remarks in this area have inspired professors and scientists around the country to parrot that Apollo 11 was not about science, but about politics.His books are all politico-philosophical, as he is a devoted humanitarian."
2,"Good on the importance of space exploration part, but...","The first couple chapters are filled with the usual Sagan illogical naturalism. I never understood how he could hold to such a irrational philosphy and yet push critical thinking on everyone (See Demon-haunted world). His best contradiction was proclaiming design and complexity in the universe, yet denying the need for a designer. He seemed to forget logic states ""chance"" has no power and that the Big Bang logically points to the need for a transcendent creator."
5,inspiring story and history by a classical romantic scientist,"Wow, great read and follows the TV program of the same title. Fine photos, and the usual Carl Sagan spirit of adventure and wonderment."
1,Pale Blue Dot - softcover edition only,"This wonderful Carl Sagan book does not include the wonderful color illustrations as the earlier version contains. Consequently, it is like a National Graphic Magazine without the pictures.I love the words of Dr. Sagan, but words plus the spectacular pictures truly make ""music.""Following is the edition you should get. I threw away the ""Pale Blue Dot"" paperback I received yesterday and today ordered a used hardback:Product DetailsHardcover: 429 pagesPublisher: Random House; 1 edition (November 8, 1994)Language: EnglishISBN-10: 0679438416ISBN-13: 978-0679438410Product Dimensions: 9.3 x 7.3 x 1.3 inchesShipping Weight: 2.8 poundsI hope this is helpful to you.Bob CargillMinneapolis, MN 55347Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space"
3,Pale,"Mishmash of material lacks the scope and grandeur of Cosmos. In effect it gives him an opportunity to catch up on about 15 years since Cosmos, but adds little beyond what was conveyed before. And goes almost nowhere in making a good case for space exploration and a weaker one in support of his SETI project. It hardly stands well on its own and even Sagan's usual comfortable style seems pale itself rather than stirring. Not a failure as a book, but certainly not his best, and only for those who either like Sagan or want a survey of those years focussing on Sagan's ideas and contributions, which may not be fully objective or complete. Get it at the library. Both Cosmos and Demon-Haunted World are more worth reading."
5,Everyone should be reading this book!,"This is a book that is for men, women, and teenagers; in fact, it is a book meant to be read by all of humanity. Pale Blue Dot's subject, the future of humanity, is imaginatively explored and it gives good insight into the future of the human race. If you do not like science fiction this book will open you up to the future and perhaps make you understand science fiction fanatics. If you like Science fiction this is a great book to read because all of science fiction is based on the science facts of today and yesterday which this book explores."
5,Put your mind in perspective,"I went into this book knowing a fairly good amount. But it is written in a way for anyone to understand.The first part of the book talks about who we were, our ideals, our mindset, our religions, our views on the world and universe. How it shaped us today.The second part goes over modern day, what we have learned, achieved, and what we aspire to.The third part is about the future of the human race. What will/could happen, what we as species will have to do to ensure we are around in the future.But the last chapter... It just sets the whole book. When I finished the last paragraph with my mind wide open. I had to sit back in my chair to think about everything I just took in. I cannot describe it, I highly recommend anyone read this book, dated or not. 50 years of tomorrow, or as a student. or a child."
5,Want to give it 6 stars,"This was the first Sagan-book I read and I was 14 at that time. I can't say I really understood it then, but it simply CHANGED my life. Now I am 18 and this book is one of the most important things in my life till now. I can't say if it's as good as Cosmos or it's better or worse than it, as it depends on your taste, but I myself think at least it can be fairly linked with Cosmos. A must-read to everyone who are interested in the Space age and its short history. And what I want to note is that if you can afford Hardcover, buy that. Not paperback. Although the text itself is not different, to understand the 'vision' and 'pale blue dot', Hardcover will be far better. For me, I bought Paperback first, but at the end I had to brought both of them!"
3,"NO PICTURES, ILLUSTRATIONS, ETC?!!!!",Be aware that the digital Kindle version does not include the pictures and illustrations that are found in the hardcover edition of this book. It's a shame because this would have been a bonus for people who bought and downloaded this version (such as myself) onto their iPads. Why would they not include the pics?!
4,Why Haven't You Bought This?,"My first question to you is... why haven't you bought this game already? It is absolutely so addictive, it may become illegal! While it gets tedious having to make your Sim use the toilet every morning, this game is so incredibly fun. You control every single aspect of your Sim. It is so amazing! I think you only become satisfied when you have created the family of your dreams. Of course, you absolutely have to get one expansion pack or else it becomes boring. I'd recommend Hot Date or Unleashed. Have fun!"
4,"fun, fun, fun!","The Sims is not only addictive, but fun, smart, interesting, and actually teaches kids while they think their IQ is dropping! i personnally LOVE the Sims and my only complaint is that it takes up a HUGE mount of computer memory. it's very hard to think that some people prefer tamagotchis over the Sims (although killing tamagotchis is fun:) anyway, if you're looking for a fun game get the Sims!!!"
2,so stupid,this game has new fetures like the new magic trade clown he will pay you a visit if youy dont take good care of your sims it is over all STUPID
4,This is a great game!,"This game is great! I bought it a couple of days ago, my friend said that it was a pretty cool expansion pack, so I tried it out at her house. Turns out, it is soooo cool."
4,perhaps should have been longer or made into a series,"This is an interesting and informative DVD to gain a broader view of how the media operates, especially during the runup to the Iraq war. However, it is so jam-packed with information that it occasionally seems to gloss over important points or scenarios. There are some segments that I would have liked Schechter to have elaborated on and a few which could have been presented more clearly. As a member of a younger generation this DVD is great because it provides an informed picture of just how much the media is in bed with government. For me, it tied a lot of loose ends together in my head and gave me a broader view of how mass media functions. I disagree with another reviewer that Schechter was in the movie too much. He was narrating his own point of view and he stayed out of the way when it was appropriate."
3,One reporter's rant against American media,"I was a little let down by this film. I had expected an expose on American news media and how it supported the Iraq war, and who in the media stood to gain from it.Instead, there was little I didn't already know, and it was presented in the first-person as Danny's own rant against American news media, and what he thought was wrong with it. There were frequent personal references to Danny and his history in the news media -- a bit egocentric.And something about it didn't quite click. It was slow, for one thing, and it kept going on and on about the same things. (A metaphor, perhaps, for how the news media cover ""important"" stuff like Michael Jackson over and over.)WMD is worth collecting if you want every film against state corporate media, but save your time and money, and watch ""Orwell Rolls in His Grave"", ""OutFoxed"", and ""A Patriot Act"", in that order, before you watch WMD."
2,Know what to expect with this book,"Just so you know, this book does not have an illustration of the cover page any actual Chick leaflet. When this says ""self-published"" it's not kidding. The book is a wide paperbook style but the pages are laid out two columns each and look as if a regular format book was coverted to be a trendy cartoon portfolio size. The font and style make it look like it was written on an old Commodore VIC-20.With that being said, the book is filled with information. It is, in effect, a catalog of Chick tracts and it is the most thorough one I am aware of as of this writing. It is just rather annoying that you are having the content DESCRIBED to you rather than SHOWN to you. In the back there is a collection of back covers of the tracts, to which I have to say ""HUH?!"" You can print the backs but not the fronts of leaflets?As widely-distributed as these things are you would think there would be a better book on them."
4,Encyclopedic!,"I am a fan of JTC's comics and was amazed at the encyclopedic extent to which this book goes into his work. The referencing system is complex and takes getting used to, but it permits a great deal of rich data to be catalogued and accounted for concisely. Indispensible for the JTC fan."
2,Very Dated Sound,"It looks like I'm going to be in the distinct minority here. I had high expectations about this album based on the other reviews, but when I put it on, I was disappointed. The sound is very dated-late 1980s ""smooth jazz"". There is very little music with any real depth too it--very glossy and over produced. Some of the cuts, those with Herbie Hancock, have a bit more bite to them, but overall the sound is very dated and simply washes by."
5,Amazingly wonderful!,"I have been unable to stop listening to this CD since the day it arrived. Dianne's songs are smooth, positive and inspiring. You will NOT be disappointed! Love her voice and style!"
1,not happy,"I bought this and when I got it I tried to install it and I could not get it to install it.Do not buy this game unless you have the right system for it.I was not happyIt will not work in my computer,so if you have Windows 98 then don't get this game"
4,Movie mayhem,"Cam Jansen is on the case whenever a mystery needs to be solved. This case happened while she was at the movies and one of the film reels mysteriously disappeared. All eyes were on the crabby manager of a competing theater who had come to watch a movie. Thanks to Cam's photographic memory and super sluth skills she quickly and easily is able to crack the case. Was it Mr. Bender the manager of Bender's Bargain Theater? You'll have to read it to find out.Cam Jansen makes a wonderful story for your young reader. It is an easy to ready chapter book with good illustratins by Susanna Natti. If you and your child are in need of a good mystery to solve, I would easily recommend the Cam Jensen series including The Mystery of the Monster Movie.By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
3,For fans of Siouxsie's later sound,"Reading about this band from the hipster faux-boho Silver Lake area of L.A., and how they began jamming with a sitar-driven sound in the wake of/for the wake of George Harrison, I was curious. Unfortunately, the sitar only is audibly effective on four songs here; the majority favor instead a post-punkish familiar dance-floor take-off on Siouxsie-style vocals and pretty typical ""alternative"" grooves. It's not bad, but not as original as I had hoped. If they had stuck with the more psychedelic explorations more hinted at than fully developed in some of the sitar-driven songs, they would have distinguished themselves more from many other groups who have followed by now a well-treaded path over the drum-bass-keys-shriek-wail terrain."
2,"Not a good ""sequal""","Don't get me wrong... this game is just as fun to play as Moon Project is. But then there is the problem... aside from coming in a different box and having different missions, it is Moon Project. No new units/vehicles/structures/anything. Patches that they released for the game add in scout vehicles for UCS and ED, change the build/research times of some things as well as costs and strengths of various things, but none of it is enough to justify it as being a sequal.Unless you just want it for the missions or can find it fairly cheap, it's a waste of money."
1,Just an orchestral CD,I was looking for live Tito. This is a live orchestrawith Tito but not much Tito and not enough Tito for this jazz trumpet fan.
5,Great,"A must for anyone looking for a good sample of some classic mambos, jazz suites, and one bolero from Tito."
4,product return,"The product was fine. It was not the kit that I thought it was(my error).The return process was great, no issues.Gil Carrillo"
1,Mixed up,The 40-134 came in a timely manner. My problem is 80% of the pins are completly mixed up. I have been rekeying for 18 years now and know how to open and work with rekeying kits. This is a joke!
5,Saved money and didn't have to worry about finding an honest locksmith,"I used this kit to rekey two houses to a single key (nearly 30 plugs in total). It took a bit of planning to assure I didn't run out of pins. With that out of the way, the first lock was the challenging. Then I was removing, rekeying, and reinstalling cylinder plugs from any of 3 different types of locks in about 15 minutes each. It was fun. Don't forget to check out the online Schlage instructions; either the condensed or the longer, more detailed version are excellent. If you rekey ""profile"" Schlage cylinders (as in Emco / Anderson storm doors) the kit does not include the hex wrench you need to remove the screw so you can ""top load"" the pins and springs. They're easy to find (it's 1.5 mm NOT 1/64"" as some web sites report) at just about any hardware store. I don't trust locksmiths, who may keep a copy of you house key without your consent; this alternative eliminates that worry completely."
3,"Parts worked great, mine showed up with everything mixed","Overall, this kit had everything I needed to rekey a couple houses' worth of Schlage locks, both entry knobs and deadbolts. As everyone else has said, it's pretty easy and kind of fun. Not having the special deadbolt wrench wasn't a problem; I used a pair of needle nose pliers.The problem I ran into was most of the small pins in the kit had gotten mixed up in shipping, so I had to use a pair of calipers to measure the pins I needed. Not a huge deal as you can sort them by eye after a couple of minutes, but it would be nice if Schlage had a better way of packing them so this didn't happen."
2,tastes like sweet red water,"This is a bland boring flavor close to a child's ""red"" colored drink mix, even when diluted to 3/4 gallon per powder cup. I drink a Gallon of water with sugar free drink mix per day. Crystal Light loses 1 star for using a cheap old sweetener, loses another star for being expensive, and loses a third star for being such a lame non existent flavor."
1,missing parts! Ugh,"We received this bed with no manual, no screws to put the bed together with and of course the lid to the mini toy box! Amazon makes it impossible to get any information from since I have no paperwork on this bed. I'm hoping to call the manufacturer to see if they'll help me. This is so irritating especially when you have your little guy staring at a bed that he cant play with. This was suppose to be an exciting thing and have him sleep in a big boy bed but since the bed has been sitting for a few days i'm sure by the time our replacements get here, it wont be so exciting anymore.The box was badly damaged with holes and such that I almost think this was a return..."
4,thomas the tank engine toddler bed,"Nice product. Not extremely strong under the mattress retaining rails. I fixed this by placing a frame under the mattress. This area is also usable as a storage compartment for bedding and such. Overall it is an easy to assemble, fun item."
5,Surprisingly durable,"Of course, any kid who loves Thomas will be thrilled with this bed. We have had it for almost a year now, and my four-year-old still likes to run trains and cars in the ""track"" down the sides of the bed. Important note: I did not read carefully, but you MUST buy and cut a piece of plywood or the mattress will fall through the bed to the floor. (It says that in the description, but I missed it.) Thank goodness my husband was home from Iraq at the time to take care of this pretty important detail! A very durable bed. I can get into the bed myself to snuggle my son at night. After a year, it is still holding up very well!"
5,INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE 4 MY KID!,"If your kid loves Thomas and Friends, you'd better buy this bed! I was so impressed with his reaction. He gave me a big kiss and , with a smile he said ""Thank you mommy""........That moment was PRICELESS!!!!!!!"
5,Grandson loves it!,"We purchased this bed for our grandson's 2nd birthday/Christmas gift. We were hoping he would be more willing to sleep in his own bed rather than with Mommy and Daddy. He loves it!! Even likes to climb up on the top - definitely not something we encourage! But, he's all boy! It is very durable - my daughter and son-in-law have laid down with him to get him to sleep with no problems. Also, a nice little crevice at the end of the bed that holds a small dvd player - making it much easier at nap time. The toy box on the front is also nice a spacious, with a removable lid. We got it quickly, too!!"
3,Lacking mattress support.,"This bed looks really neat and my 3 yo loves it, BUT it has no mattress support. The mattress rests on the edges only. The mattress we just spent $160 on falls through the center and we have to keep putting it back. When it hasn't fallen through, it sags. We plan to go to Lowe's this weekend and buy plywood to fit the bottom as a support for the mattress. Others suggested using the crib support, but we didn't use a crib, so we don't have that."
2,Screwy screws and HUGE in size,"Pay very close attention to the details! This bed is massive. My son has a very tiny room I got the bed, put it in his room, and the tip of the toy box is touching the wall. Not recommended for a small room!The screws, they gave me 2 mis lengthened ones along with the right amount of the others. One was too small (and had a funky screw head) and the other was in the middle of this big and small ones.Friendly tip = They tell you on the package that the provide no support for the child's mattress to go on. BUT read the package more! Use the cribs old spring support; it will for right into it. No need for plywood.I will say the package arrived quick though, and it is a fun bed great for a big fan!!!!!! My only complaints were the sheer size of it and (maybe its just me) but the 2 screws. Other than that great product!"
2,"No umph in the bass; Very tight fit; heavy, awkward cord","I've been comparing these headphones with a pair of $20 Sony MDR-V150 headphones I've had for years.Compared to the Sonys, the Sennheisers have very little umph in the bass. When the music swells in a loud place, the bass gets completely buried under the mid range, so you lose the roots of your chords. The Sonys have a much richer, warmer bass that never gets buried.Additionally, the Sennheisers are quite tight on my head, and I have a small head! They squeeze the sides of my face quite a lot, so they aren't particularly comfortable for wearing all day.Finally, they have a very heavy, stiff, bulky cord. I have to wrap it around my chair arm to keep it from flopping awkwardly. When it flops, or when it stiffly rubs against my shoulder or shirt collar, I can hear it loudly in my ear, so if I'm listening, I have to keep the cord still.Overall, not a good purchase. I like my $20 Sonys better."
4,Solid headphones,I didn't get these headphones to listen to music and I haven't yet. I watch netflix videos and use these headphones because the internal speaker on my laptop is not good. I think these headphones are awesome. They block out background noise and deliver a crisp clear sound. I had my air conditioner blasting all summer long and I sit by it while on the computer and I don't even notice the noise from the A/C until I take them off. The one complaint I have about this is that since I have a big head I need to stretch these out to their maximum size. It presses on the top of my head. I had this same brand before and they seemed more rounded and fit over my head without pressing down. If you have a fat head like me it's something to consider. Over all I still love them though.
4,"Large, work well","I've had these for almost a year now with no problems. I bought them mainly for use when traveling, or anytime I want people to know I don't want to be bothered. They work. They are quite large, which should be expected with this type of headphone. The size does make my ears tired after a long flight. Great cord length. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is great as well. Try on before a long term commitment. Star deducted on behalf of my ears."
5,Perfect,"I only need one word but I have to use at lease 20. Here it is these are absolutely ""PERFECT"".Follow-up. I keep reading not enoght bass, these go down to 8hz and an impedance of 64 Ohms. For monitoring these are hard to beat for the price. All around produces a really accurate reptoduction of the recording sound."
3,My Take on the HD-280,"I've had the HD-280's for about a year now.I will get straight to the point.Pros:`one of the best sub 100 closed headphones out there`decent treble and punchy bass`dynamic frequency spectrum`clear highs`great for sound monitoring`noise isolation about 10dbs`user replaceable partsCons:`plastic headband might start cracking after heavy usage`big and heavy, not too portable`these phones are not musical`music sounds tinned out at some high frequency levels`sound stage could be better`some might like it, but coil wires get really annoying`coil wires create uneven weight that pulls down the left side`personally, I find the design of the headphones hideous, worse when it is actually on your head.For reference I own a HD-555, DT-880, ER6i, and Grados SR-80"
2,Didn't get what I paid for.,"These are pricey headphones. I expected quality and I hoped for comfort. I got neither.Specifically, these headphones are very bright (louder highs softer mids and lows). This can be somewhat corrected with an equalizer but that's kind of a pain to have to do for everything. Most disappointingly, I found a heavy sibilance that I just couldn't ignore.As fare as comfort, these things are like a vice for your skull. If I didn't wear glasses I might have been able to get used to the pressure. But I do wear glasses and I didn't pay this much for headahces."
3,Returned,Bought and returned because my husband didn't like it as much. Not that it's not a great product.. He just wasn't feeling it as we'll as he wanted to for recording.. Says it was too bulky. But other than that it wasn't bad. But returning it was a breeze with no problems.
4,owned for years,"Ive had the HD 280 pros for what seems to be 4 years, they still sound great, no loose rattling typical in old used speaker components. however the plastic and leather material is starting to peel and deteriorate similar to an old car center console, other then that they work well. I wrote this because I'm scared they will melt into goop and ruin my hair cut tho. I would buy again just keep in mind you wont be able to write them in your will or anything like that."
4,"Great sound, blocks outside noise, comfortable","I am no expert but I have to say that the Sennheiser HD-280 are pretty awesome headsets. The sound is great, they are confortable and it blocks outside noise pretty good for not being noise cancelling.Just # observations. I wish the plug was detachable from the headset like in so many other Sennheiser models and I wish they would come with a holder. Lastly, although they are very comfortable, they are a bit tight, I am just hoping it is because they are pretty new.Overall, great buy"
4,Great sound and high quality but only decent comfort,"I have had these headphones for a year and a half and i think they are very good. The sound quality is just as good as the Bose QuiteComfort around ear headphones, but are not as comfortable. The HD 280 Pros are a little tight on the head and the foam padding around the ears isn't too soft, at least in comparison to the Bose, but heck the Sennheisers are a third the price. I really like cord the HD 280's because it is very thick so there is no worry for the wires to ware and break.Pros: Excellent sound qualityThick and long cableEasy to repair, lots of spare parts available.Great priceCons: Not too comfortable, hurts you're head after a few hoursConclusion: The Sennheiser 280 Pro is the best headphones for under 300 dollars."
2,"Good sound, uncomfortable, cable coiling fell appart","The headsets are fairly well built and the sound is good. I have a big head so they clamp down and after a while they gete uncomfortable, but I would not call this a flaw.Where my problem came is on the coiled cable, the cable lost the ""memory"" of the coiling and it became an unruly mess; this happened 2-3 months after I got them as a gift.Mine were given to me by my wife Christmas of 2009, in November of 2010 I tried contacting the company to see if anything could be done, they told me I could buy a new cable and when I asked if this is not something that should be covered under warranty, I never received a reply.No way am I going to buy a replacement cable that will most likely do the same thing within a short period of time. I will look elsewhere next time I am looking for headsets."
5,WOW WHAT IS THIS!!!! 69 dollars!!! This is the best buy for the year!!!!,"Great Quality for 69 dollars!!! Wow I can not believe the price!!!I BOUGHT WITH THE E5 AMP, WORKS GREAT WITH MY IPHONE 4. BIG DIFFERENCE!!!I LOVE ITTHANKS!!!"
2,Nice If You Like Lots Of High Freq.,"These are really tilted toward the high frequencies. If you have upper-end hearing loss, these might be just the thing. As others said, not much bass, either. Went back to my AKG K-240's-they sound so much more natural. Expected more from Sennheiser. I'm a musician and studio owner."
2,OK Sound Poor Quality and Service,"I purchased this product as a Christmas present and the right headphone started sporadically going silent after three weeks. Merchant refused an exchange and I had to mail it back to Sennheiser. Except for a confirmation of receipt, which was e-mailed four days after USPS confirmed delivery, I have not heard anything or received the product back in over two weeks. My experience is that this product is of poor quality and durability and backed by even worse service. I'd suggest buying another brand.Sennheiser HD 280 - Headphones ( ear-cup ) - black"
3,a,This headset has low bass.I do not recommend anyone to get this headset if you are wearing glasses.it just hurts my ear as I was wearing this to listen my music
2,bulky--heavy,"I am a big fan of headphones. This pair of headphones in comparing with the Bose is too heavy and comfortable for my ears. Giving the price of the product, I guess it is ok."
1,not as advertised,"I selected ""noise cancellation"" headphones when browsing on amazon. When they arrived, I noted that they have no noise cancellation circuitry. This is the fault of Amazon for not advertising them correctly. As for performance, sound quality, etc. I cannot comment since I never used them. They appear to be very well built and have quality construction. Also note that these headphones are huge, and seem only appropriate for home use."
3,big & bulky,"I commute with my iPod and these headphones are so much bigger & bulkier than they look in the picture. It was an unpleasant surprise. The sound quality is ok but it does ""fuzz out"" on the lower bass notes."
5,Perfect!,"These are excellent headphones! They are confortable(I really can't understand the ones who says it hurts or it doesn't fit properly), light-weighted, and the sound is wonderful(please don't compare them with U$300,00 headphones)."
2,Not up to expectations,"Sound is good, but the comfort level is horrendous. These earphones are so tight around the head that it is painful. I left them stretching on a basketball for days to help loosen them up, but I gave up and returned them. I am now using the HD 448 and it is much better. They are lightweight and comfortable. The sound is good, perhaps not quite as good as the HD-280's, but at least I can wear them."
4,"Great isolation, very comfortable","I just ordered my second set of these. My first set finally cracked in the headband after ten years of use. I glued the piece that broke and wrapped electrical tape around it, so I can still use them, but I want a new set for my home studio. Highly recommended for anyone tracking near numerous open mics (like drummers)."
5,Absolutely magnificent!,"Wow. I think that is all I have to say! These headphones are absolutely what I was in search for when it came to a good quality pair of headphones to use when playing my guitar. The sound is phenomenal and they are extremely comfortable which is great for long periods of wearing them. I love how flexible and durable they are to fix exactly to your head. I had read a couple reviews that said they lacked good bass but another said you have to find where they are positioned just right and success! The bass is perfectly proportioned to all the other sounds. Also read they get even better after breaking them in after a week or two, not sure how much better they can already get but we shall see! Highly recommended!"
5,"Great product at this price, pleased.","At the price Amazon was selling this, its by a long distance the best headphones one can buy. Comfortable, great sound, incredible noise reduction.Would recommend."
5,"Great Sound, Comfortable Fit","I bought these headphones when I moved into an apartment complex. I could no longer listen to my music at loud and obnoxious volumes. One of the things I knew I'd miss most was my subwoofer. Headphones never seem to deliver quite enough bass - until I found these. The sound is incredible! They do a really nice job of canceling outside noises, as well as preventing other people in the room from hearing what you're listening to. Excellent quality for the price. The price on Amazon beats everything I've found."
3,Disappointing sound quality,"I'm not sure why so many people are praising these headphones. My guess is that the HD280 might be good for listening to a one instrument at a time during recording. But when music comes together they produce completely lifeless sound - all the vibrancy of the music composition is lost.I tried them with different sources iphone, pc, and stereo amplifier. I tried different music styles: from David Brubeck to Radiohead. But the results were the same - flat and lifeless. Then I compared them with other headphones I have - AudioTechnica ATN-ANC7 and Koss PortaPro. Both had by far better tonal balance and IMHO are more convenient to wear.Anyway my verdict is very simple: NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Headphones,Disapponted. The headphones are heavier than I expected from previous online reviews and fit very tight on the head making them uncomfortable for prolonged use. Online reviews indicated light and comfortable. I had tried Bose and they were light and comfortable but Amazon reviews indicated they were not of high quality material and deteriorated quickly.
4,Bass deficient but incredibly clear picture of stereo field...,"My initial impression when using these headphones was that they have little to no bass response. Not a big deal, mainly it means that I won't be using them to reference mixes. They do however, provide an incredibly clear picture of the stereo field. Also, I found that the lack of bass actually makes these headphones very useful for tracking (particularly when adding to a song that has little or no mix yet), as they suck out any excess bass buildup that would otherwise muddy up the mix for the musicians.Overall I would recommend these headphones if you are looking for a great tracking headphone with little to no bleed. I'll still use my ATH-M50's come mix time though!"
2,not comfortable,it is not comfortable. can't ware it for a very long time.and the sound is just so so.not as good as I thought.
2,Not good headphones for the $$$,"These headphones are NOT professional. They have a muffled sound that does not give me the full dynamic of the music HD headphones are supposed to have. The bass is weak, the treble is muffled and the mids are practically non existent. If you are a professional music PRODUCER, STAY AWAY FROM THESE HEADPHONES. The average Joe Music Consumer would swear these are good headphones. But to those of us that Know better, stay away from these. Sennheiser is a very good company and the HD203's are some very good headphones. Buy those before you waste $$$ on these."
3,Very Tight on th ehead,"This headphone has very good audio quality but after 5-10 minutes it is very uncomfortable to wear. I am starting to have headaches on the side of my head above the ears after that time.I have had it for the past 12 months and now I dread wearing it. I am 5'9"" with average sized head. Try this before you get this. It does not stretch with time."
2,Unimpressive sound quality. Good noise isolation.,"I don't understand why these cans are rated so well for sound quality. Detail is good but only with certain recordings. Separation is non existant. Sound stage is relatively small. Overall they come off as dull and uninspiring. Sure they're meant as monitor headphones but I don't think I'm confusing flat with ""just not that good.""I really wanted to like them for listening to music but after giving them more than a fair shake I'm retiring them to my pc for gaming."
2,Fragile,"This set of headphones has great sound quality, however, it's only marginally better on paper than its Sony counterpart. Because it has problems with a very brittle headband, and will very quickly crack and break away entirely into sharp pieces of hard plastic, I cannot recommend these headphones except for review for product safety. Every time I have to send away my pair to get repaired I have to pay for shipping to Sennheiser, and I am without the headphones for weeks as a result. Save yourself a headache and possibly further physical injury and consider getting the Sony headphones..."
2,Not passive noise cancelling headphones,"I am not going to comment on the sound/audio because I really only purchased it for the passive noise reduction capability. I am very disappointed in that aspect, as these headphones hardly block any voices that can be heard. I even plugged it in my evo to see if the noise reduction is any better with music playing on, and it was only a minor difference because I can still hear the people around me. I was hoping it would reduce the noise to a low hum, but it did not even do that. Someone reviewed that they could not hear their girlfriend's voice when putting these on, and I am not sure how that can be possible as I can hear my family's voices even from a good distance. I need these to study because I am easily distracted, and these headphones just did not do it for me. I am not sure how some reviewers said they work amazing is blocking office noises."
2,"Average Sound Quality, AWFUL Comfort","I bought these headphones to replace my earbud iPod headphones, which are obviously not isolated at all. I was hoping I could get a good, high quality sound with a comfortable fit. I got the sound part, but with these headphones, the fit is ridiculously painful.People comment mostly on the ear pieces being too hard, but it's the strap at the top that gave me a headache. It pressed down on my head firmly, at first giving a neutral, fitted feeling. But after about 5 minutes the band became uncomfortable, and after a half hour, it was downright painful. Even after taking the headphones off, my scalp was still sensitive and hurting.I do NOT recommend these headphones. I give them 2 stars because they do what they say they do. They just don't do it well. And certainly not $80 worth."
2,I wanted to like these....,But they were just not very good.The cushions were stiff and creaky and made listening a nightmare.Cord was long enough to reach the moon it seemed.In the end I returned these.
2,"Poor sound quality, uncomfortable","My old Bose QuietComfort 2 (noise-cancelling) headphones were falling apart after years of use. I was using them at work, so I checked if my company provided headphones that I could use. They gave me the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro. I figured these should be fine -- I am happy with the Bose AE2 (non-noise-cancelling) headphones that I usually use at home, and while the HD-280s are cheaper, they are not _that_ much cheaper.So I put them on and started some music, and within about 15 seconds I took them off, packed them up, and brought them back. The sound quality was very noticeably worse than what I was used to. Furthermore, the headphones are much heavier than what Bose makes (you can tell from the picture), and they pinched my head too much. I ended up buying a second pair of AE2s instead (on my own dime). Much better."
3,"Great sound, poor fit","I love listening to and recording music, and I decided it was time to invest in a good pair of headphones. There are many to choose from, but I decided on these because of the name, the good reviews, and the price.They definitely sound great, and as picky as I am, I have no real complaints about the audio quality.But as many people mentioned, they definitely hurt your head. Even though I read these reviews, I decided to risk it, especially because my head is not large. But they hurt.I'm too lazy to return them, but if I had to do it over again, I'd look for something with a little more comfort."
4,"Nice sound, but like wearing a piece of furntiture on your head.","Bought them. They sound nice, but they're pretty substantial in size and design. I feel like I'm wearing a piece of furniture on my head. I compare this to the PX-100s which have tremendous sound for their size (however they lack the sound isolation qualities found in the 280). So, in summary, the price is fair/honest, the sound is good, the units are pretty clunky. If the latter is an issue, and sound isolation isn't critical, i.e., you won't offend people in the office, gym, bed, bus, etc. with your sound bleed, check out the PX-100s."
2,"Great sound, shoddy construction","These headphones sound great, but after less than nine months of use, the cheap plastic headband is cracking apart, and I'd give them another week before it breaks down completely.Sennheiser put some great drivers into some comfortable headphones here, but if they have a terrible quality headband, what's the point? Given the knowledge that these would utterly wear out so quickly, I would not have bought them."
2,Disappointing,Sennheiser 555 (modded to 595) and Sennheiser 598 are far better than these.Sony DLP777 is better in my opinion.Ear cups are not soft and made of a material that squeaks against my glasses. I would prefer the soft pads of the Bose QC2/QC15 on these.
5,A headphone masterpiece,"For the price, under 100 dollars, these headphones are worth every penny. I know the beats by dr dre are great, but they pre-boost the bass. If you want headphones that give you true audio then get these. If you're using them for mixing you can't go wrong."
5,as good as new!,"Of course I'm a fan of Sennheiser Headphones, and I'm also a fan of frugality. So, when my search turned up a refurbished pair for $20 less than I anticipated spending, I couldn't resist trying them out. When they arrived, I couldn't tell they were pre-owned at all. They still have about 60 hours of playing before really wearing in, but they already sound truer than any other headphones (in the less-than-arm-and-a-leg price range) I've experienced. 100% satisfied!"
5,Great Sound for Great Product!,"I bought these headphones in my intention to use with my Android tablet for streaming movie from Netflix and listening to music from my song collections. These headphones have a lot of bass, and the sound is really crisp. This is my third Sennheiser products purchased on Amazon. They all work great! I do not need to give my comments since so many good reviews on this product were described and posted in this forum already.All in all, this product again has met my expectations in terms of sound quality and solid build."
3,Meh,"I know virtually nothing about headphones, so this is a lay-man's view on this set.I've had these headphones for about a month now, and they're just 'OK' in my opinion. The sound quality is OK, it's comparable to the crappy earphones I picked up for $10, and surprisingly I think they're about equal in loudness.The noise cancellation is pretty good, but it's probably due to the really tight coverage of the ears by the ear pads.On that note, the headphones are incredibly tight for me, after a few minutes I can hear the thudding of the veins in my head, after 30 mins I get a headache, and I would really not recommend these for long periods of usage as they are rather uncomfortable."
3,Great sound but not the best for the price,"PROS:- great highs and lows- decent qualityCONS:- heavy on the top so it slips off during head nodding movement- could be cheaper, there are better headphones like Sony xb500 which is only $50 or xb700 which is $100"
3,not for amateurs,good sound but way to heavy. I can't handle the weight so I returned the headphones and got a pair of bose.
2,So disappointed,"I really wanted to like these because it seemed like I was getting a good deal on quality headphones. I'm a small person and these headphones were HUGE on me and I read the reviews before purchasing, no mention of size. I was intending to wear these while I work as a studio artist but they are just too bulky to be active with. The cord is coiled and I really wish they would state that in the specs because it makes the headphones even heavier. The sound quality was disappointing as well, I might as well be listening to music through a tin can. No bass. At all. The only thing I really liked about these were the excellent sound isolation."
3,Leatherette earpads squeak when they rub against glasses,"Yes, they sound great. No, they're not terribly comfortable. Yes, the price is great for what you get. But here's a problem I've never seen mentioned, and it's driving me crazy. I use these headphones when I'm recording for an audiobook. I need a VERY quiet room, and these leatherette earpads squeak when they rub up against the arms of my glasses. It's VERY annoying, and I can't believe I'm the only person to experience this. I wish Sennheiser made velvet style replacement earpad covers. Then I'd be totally happy."
3,"Big, heavy, uncomfortable","While apparently a high quality product with good sound and noise control,it is very heavy,bulky and uncomfortable. Also it has a single permanent very long and heavycord."
4,Great Quality!,"I am by no means a professional, but enjoy a good sounding headphone that lets me hear the softer sounds with as much clarity as the louder ones. These have fit the bill. They cancel most outside noise, have a high quality sound, and are decent on an MP3 player (maybe a little high, but with the right equalizer settings, it's good) as well as the stereo. I would definitely recommend them for audiophiles. The cash you shell out is well worth the sound you get with these."
3,good value,Good for airplane or loud locations. Blocked out a lot of noise. Did not have to increase volume. Cheap alternative to noise canceling types. Sound is a little muddy.
2,These headphones had a nice sounds but were heavy and not as comfortable as I had wanted. I returned the headphones for a refund,These headphones had a nice sounds but were heavy and not as comfortable as I had wanted. I returned the headphones for a refund
5,Hearing is believing,My third Sennheiser headphones. These are awesome. The best sound of any set of headphones I have ever tried. Really comfortable to wear.
4,great headphones for cheap,"these have all the loudness and clarity you expect from sennheiser. my previous headphones were the HD-570, which were slightly larger and had velour earpads. The velour is gone, but the wire is now coiled making handling easier. These are also great for computer gaming."
1,Great sound - Poor constriction,"I have two sets of these that I have used for a few years. It seems the HD280 is made of poor construction materials. The Ear pads, and top head pad are shedding. Further the plastic of the headband is splitting and creaking. A piece just broke completely off of the headband. I am not hard on equipment and have used much audio gear for over 40 years. Headsets in this price range should last 10 years not 3. Worse I just got my adult Son a set for his birthday before I realized how bad these were. Sennheiser should at least make replacement parts besides ear pad and cord. These beak even when trying to take care of them."
2,"All highs, No lows","If you are looking for headsets for your mp3 player or your computer, look elsewhere because the sound is EXTREMLY disapointing if if thats what your after. They sound quality is no better than apple's standard white earbuds.The good:very nice sound isolationmade for professional useI use these when I play my electirc guitar at night. They come with a jack that allows you to plug into a sub.the bad:The sound sucks. No better than earbudsNO bass. If you play around with the EQ (equalizer folks) their is no difference. It just creates distortion.DONT buy if your looking to use them on a computuer or with an mp3 player. You will be very disapointed. Really. Don't let the hundered dollar price tag fool ya."
1,BEWARE,"BEWARE, I bought these headphones in November 2009 and they were great until September 2010. One of the earphones started making a scratchy noise. I checked the warranty and there is a 2 year warranty from Sennheiser on this product, so I contacted them. Sennheiser then informed me that because I purchased them from Z-Electria from Amazon's site, the warranty was void. I guess I didn't realize that I wasn't purchasing from AMAZON, but in reality I was getting the product from another source. Apparently Sennheiser has a whole list of NON-AUTHORIZED retailers (see Senn's website) and if you buy from one of these retailers, your warranty is VOID.Senn told me to contact AMAZON.Amazon told me that I needed to contact Z-Electria to get resolution.Big hassle and runaround, so I won't buy any more of these headphones from any source."
4,"Nice sound, low bass","Comfortable headphones, I can wear them for a few hours with no worries. Sometimes get hot and sweaty ears because of it, but there is no preventing that. Built well and seem like they will last a long time. Plus the replaceable parts is a big plus. When music or any sound is playing, the noise reduction is great. Otherwise with no sound, outside noise is only muffled. The bass is lacking, but for the price these are nice."
3,"Great sound, plastic problems","I have a set of Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones. As others have said, the sound is great. Warm and rich and NOT short of bass. The problem I want to warn people about is the plastic slider parts. As others have said, they crack. The outer shell in particular. My head is perhaps larger than some but I'm not sure that's why these parts crack. Once they crack, the inside panel pops out, exposing the inner wires. I've lost the inside panel for the left side... The right side is hanging in by a thread. Bottom line: these cans fit well and sound great but the plastic breaks easily. If you buy them, treat them gently."
4,Four and a Half Stars,"Excellent sound, great insulation, and a comfortable fit. I listened with Sonys for several years and finally upgraded to Sennheiser (590, then 280). If you're still listening to Sony headphones, you don't know what you're missing.I use my phones for home listening, portable listening, and DJing. They are excellent in all situations.Half a star off for the big head issue. My phones have cracked and pieces have broken off, but not in serious places. Still..."
4,good headphones,i spent quite a bit of time researching headphones before i bought this pair. It was simply the best i could find for the price i was looking for. They are comfortable and I'm very glad i bought them.
3,"Great sound, but UNCOMFORTABLE!","I have to agree with many of the reviewers who have given these earphones low marks for comfort -- the sound is great, but it just doesn't make up for the fact that the ear pads are very hard and they really aren't large enough to cover the ear. Very uncomfortable to use for more than about 30 minutes or so. I am very disappointed, especially after reading the many GOOD reviews. These people must have really small, really hard heads."
3,"Great sound, but too big for head","I purchased these for my (now ex) GF, based on reviews and getting her something different than my Sony MDR-v6 headphones. They had great sound quality, better than my V6's, but sadly, they were WAY too big for her head, so we returned them. If you have a larger head (or a normal sized head) they should work great for you. If your head is on the smaller side, look for a different style."
3,Great sound quality...but ugly,"The sound is great, however, the headphone looks like some kinds of telephone in 80's. I'll use it at home but definitely not in public"
3,"good quality, overpriced","These headphones ARE good, there's no doubt about quality. The issue I had was that, based on all the research and web surfing I could do, they're virtually idnetical to the MUCH cheaper HD280 headphones that are plain jane and come whithout the fancy silver accesories. They both come with the exact same instruction manual! So, save your pennies and go for the regualr joe version."
3,sennheiser hd-280 headphones,"Claimed to be refurbished and include a one year sennheiser warranty, but with no receipt or warranty card I have no evidence of either?? Headphones work fine though"
2,medicore and extremely uncomfortable,"I bought it since the price temporarily dropped. After using it for one day, I decide to return it.1. The build quality is ok, but it is 100% plastic feeling.2. sound quality is ok, clean but not deep nor expressive, but why do I buy a ~100USD heavy headphone just because it is ok?3. It is way tooooo tight. It is not about the pain on the ears, it is about the pain right on the contact point on my head.I don't have abnormal size head, the pain is instant on and it kills all the (possible) fun of listening to music.conclusion: if you love to pay ~100USD to get a device to press hard on your head, go for it.If you plan to buy a music listening device, then forget about it."
1,Sennheiser HD-280 Pro,"These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever experienced. Not only are they bulky and imbalanced, the earcups simply do not fit properly."
2,"Sound OK, but are very bulky & uncomfortable..","I have been using Sony 7506's forever. So comfortable. So clear. So flimsy. The cord is not detachable, so I have gone through three pair already with the cord always getting loose. Having said this, after doing a lot of online investigations, it seemed that the Sennheiser 280s were rated closest in sound, have a detachable cord (feature not available in Sonys) and were supposedly comfortable. They are NOT comfortable. Sure the ear cups swivel and they collapse so you can travel with them, and they sound almost as good as the Sonys, but not AS good.. So, I will have to stick with my clear, flimsy, but very comfortable Sonys moving forward.... Oh well.."
2,I was disappointed,"Seeing all of the great reviews and getting these recommended by a friend, I decided to buy them. I was very disappointed when i plugged them in and listened to them. There is almost no bass on these headphones.These headphones have very good treble tones and you can hear every detail of what you are listening to. They are also comfortable. But there is very very weak bass. This was the case when plugging them into my computer, my turntables, and my guitar amp (even while i was playing a bass with the bass knob all the way up and everything else down), so I think I have to blame it on the headphones.i will be returning these headphones and looking for a new pair."
2,very low sound dont buy it,"beside all the description that this headphone has, i need to add one more. Yes it has great features, quality of sound and everything else, but the sound that comes out is really low. You can hear people talking around you. The music is clear but no enough sound coming out of the speakers. I paid $100 for them, way too much money for poor low sound."
2,Dissapointed,"The Sennheiser HD 280s had such rave reviews for sub $100 headphones that I couldn't wait to try them to replace my 8 year old Sony headphones which were getting pretty worn. In the end though, this purchase made me appreciate the Sony 7506 headphones that much more (better bass, much more present, and way more comfortable). Go for the Sonys!"
4,Sennheiser 280 Headphones,"I Had these for about two years they are very Good for the price. I Am pleased with every aspect, however the bass when they are used with a computer sound card and some devices without boost is hit or miss. I have also found that in almost all cases when listening to clasical music you need to bust the bass in order to balance the highs."
5,Fantastic Headphone,"Add me to the list of almost 200 people who have given this product a 5 star review on Amazon. Awesome headphone value from the king of headphone makers. From someone who owns a dozen headphones, including some that retail for almost 4 times as much. While they may be slightly tight, I actually like how snug they are -- they feel very secure on your head, unlike alot of ""super comfortable"" headphones. Plus, that's the price you pay for such great isolation. Buy them."
5,"Great Sound, Great Price","These headphones are very comfortable and produce a great sound. I use them with my ipod and a portable DVD player, on airplanes primarily and they do a good job of blocking outside sound with the around the ear design. The price was right compared to what i saw on other sites and they arrived very quickly, within a few days. Highly recommended to all."
4,"Incredible sound, bulky design","Just received my HD 280 Headphones, the sound quality is exactly like I had imagine, but the design is incredibly bulky, if I could go back I probably would have ordered the HD-555's"
3,Nice headphone.. nice sound.. but bulky,"Its a very nice headphone... nice sound... but I found it very heavy.. after using for about an hour of so, I used to get head ache.. so stopped using it.. but I will still recommend it for its good quality and also for a short time use..."
4,Sennheiser headphones are great!,"Headphones sound great on my Ipod. TheY are a bit large, but very comfort to wear if you don't mind looking mentally challenged:-) Overall, headphones perform very well and even eliminate some of the surrounding noise without having to buy the expensive headphones (e.g. Bose Quiet ComfortI, II, III or whatever). Enjoy!"
4,"Great sounding, but not durable","I agree with everyone that these phones sound great, but they physical quality of them is terrible. It didn't take long for the plastic to start cracking and break--however, they are still usable! I have kept them at the church sound console and they still fit on the head fine."
3,Pretty good,"The had very good quality, but they are really snug fitting, and make your head look very wide. Because of that it hurts if you wear them for longer than a half hour."
2,It hurts my ears.,I like the sound from it but it hurts my ears. It is bulky too. I would buy something else.
3,Not to my taste but decent,"To me, these headphones just sound too thin. The deep bass is there if you listen, but in terms of overall impact and body, these sounded very bass deficient to me. The high frequencies dominate. They're smooth but bright. The soundstage is on the smaller side but well resolved. I heard some details that I've never noticed before on some songs, but overall the lack of bass just kept these from really being enjoyable for me. It's a matter of personal taste."
2,Snap Crackle Pop!,"The set I bought was comfortable, produced a nice sound, and passively blocked noise well. (Here it comes.) BUUUTTTT these headphones popped and crackled constantly with the two heavy bass test tracks I tried on them. If you're not going to use them with that kind of audio (super heavy bass) then they'll work fine for you. With that kind of restriction though, they just aren't worth the price."
2,"Good sound, uncomfortable, cable coiling fell appart","The headsets are fairly well built and the sound is good. I have a big head so they clamp down and after a while they get uncomfortable, but I would not call this a flaw.Where my problem came is on the coiled cable, the cable lost the ""memory"" of the coiling and it became an unruly mess; this happened 2-3 months after I got them as a gift.Mine were given to me by my wife Christmas of 2009, in November of 2010 I tried contacting the company to see if anything could be done, they told me I could buy a new cable and when I asked if this is not something that should be covered under warranty, I never received a reply.No way am I going to buy a replacement cable that will most likely do the same thing within a short period of time. I will look elsewhere next time I am looking for headsets."
3,"Not Great, But Worth the Money","Took some getting use to, because I'm accustomed to a brighter, more detailed sound. But the warmth and creaminess makes for a pleasant listening experience. Older analog recordings sound better with these cans as it masks the imperfections and smoothens everything out. Not really good for the studio where definition and detail are paramount. Good upgrade for those coming out of cheap headsets."
4,"over all good, not for active people","purchased these after reading a lot of reviews. choice was between senn. 280 pro or the 595's. I wanted to wear these while snowboarding or going to the gym, let me say there a whole lot bulkier then i thought. strictly made for home use, or travel. the sound qaulity is great and songs sound so much better then you thought. this being my first set of nice headphones i cant say too much."
4,Great Sound at a Great Price,"A comfortable fit and they sound great. Whether listening to music or gaming, they sound great. Almost all outside noise is eliminated by closed-ear design. Includes a 1/4"" adapter that screws over 1/8"" plug. That eliminates any possible problems with loose connection of adapter."
4,"Great Headphones, but know what you are buying","I bought these headphones as a gift for a friend and they did not respond as expected out of the box, but after a reasonable Burn-in period they perform just as expected. Good sound, comfortable for long listening sessions, great noise isolation. One thing that was a problem that i did not realize would be was the re-coiling cord. It acts like a spring on ones head more than i thought that it would, but for professional applications I can understand why this would be a feature and not a hindrance."
5,Sennheiser HD-280,"Excellent headphones, I knew from other reviews that I could expect a quality set of headphones. I ordered these around Thanksgiving time and got a fantastic price which made this purchase a ""no-brainer"". The sound is exactly what I was looking for, no boominess, nice clarity on the top end, great cans for monitoring. They are very comfortable on my head, I like the long cord provided with them. I expect these to provide me with many hours of quality service. Would recommend these to anyone interested in a serious set of cans for monitoring or for serious music listening."
4,ONE OF THE BEST,These headphones are in a league of their own price wise. They're not the most comfortable pair of headphones but they break in well. I owned the Sony of this price and they were ok. The sound seemed fake like a boost. These are flat and have great low frequency response! I owned the DRE studio's prior to these and are very comparable. The Dres cosmetically feel better but the sound is about the same.
2,Low End Failed...,"Headphones sound great. They are tight, but that's okay with me for home recording use.Problem: only had for 6 weeks and headphones failed. Low end became a static buzz and I had to send to Sennheiser via mail for repair.I wish Amazon would have taken them back so I could have purchased something different, but 30 days is all you get. We'll see how long the next ones last..."
2,A Big Headache,"I just received them in the mail yesterday and these headphones hurt my head. After wearing them to watch a movie on my computer, I had a terrible headache. I will be returning them to Amazon for a refund and to find another pair. I'm really disappointed after hearing such great reviews about the sound. I bought them to replace my Sony MDR-V6. They are ok, but the Pads come off too much, and the sound isn't that great.So in all, the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro sound is good, not great, but the headset are very uncomfortable. They don't reduce external sounds. The price for them are good, but not worth these headphones. They seem very durable. They just need some way to adjust the fitting."
4,Awesome Heavy Duty Headphones,"I was in need of some sturdy, durable and comfortable headphones. People kept referring me to Sennheiser, and I'm glad I bought these headphones.Pros: The sound quality is terrific, and the amount of noise cancellation is wonderful when you're actually wearing them. They don't require any batteries, they're incredibly durable (toss them at your desk as hard as you like), and they feel great.Cons: Initially there I experienced some discomfort after wearing them for long periods of time (on and off over 4 hours) but since then I've grown used to wearing them during a work day. My only true gripe with this headphones is that max volume was max. The sound doesn't seem like it quite goes to 11, but the sound quality still is superb.Definitely buy these headphones if you're looking for something that's worth your money, long-lasting, and will deliver awesome sound fidelity."
2,"Great, but it's breaking apart...","These headphones produce nice sounds, isolate noise well and would be great if it wasn't breaking apart and I'm using super-glue to hold it together.Had these headphones for a while now and love them since day one for the great sound, but the plastic headpiece holding the adjustable connecting extensions are literally breaking apart. I had to super-glued the left side so that I may continue using them a couple of months back and now I'm gluing the right side as well. These headphones are only used in the office so it's not like it was crushed in a backpack or something, only been behind my monitor since I bought them. I would recommend anyone considering these headphones to reconsider."
1,"Great sound but very, very fragile","First of all - I am a older individual who is very careful of my possessions. Most of my stereo equipment has many, many years of use on it and it's in perfect shape. But - the headband's on these are CHEAP and will break under responsible use. Buyer beware."
2,"Love Sennheiser, Hate These...","As good as they may sound, I have not been able to get past the extreme discomfort these cause my rather big head! They are too tight, too heavy, too hot, I'm always conscious they are on, and I just noticed, as I kept find pieces of black plastic on the floor around me, that the headband has been shedding it's ""skin"", and must've been for awhile, as big chunks of it are now gone.SInce I read that Sennheiser will replace them under their warranty, I am hoping they will consider sending me a different model instead......."
3,"Musician, using these for studio feedback","I'm a singer and guitar player, and use these for feedback during recording sessions ... very high quality sound at a very good price.After about a month, I'm still quite happy with the ""bang per buck"" factor, these are professional quality, at a reasonable price. My only complaint is the cord ... they have a coiled cord (like a heavy version of the old telephone cords), and it's only about 3 feet long un-stretched, which means you are very quickly to the point where you are tugging against the coils with the left earpiece, where the cord connects. I wish they just had a simple long straight cord instead."
5,Great headphones for listening and monitoring,"I'm very happy with these headphones, not just for studio monitoring but for general use. They are very comfortable (don't mind wearing them for extended periods of time) and the music quality is perfect since they don't jumble the bass. I highly recommend them. Plus they're very reasonably priced."
2,Good sound but clamps head too much,"I purchased the HD-280 Sennheiser headphones about a year ago for $80 from Amazon via J&R. The headphones sound nice, but after 5 minutes of wear, I was getting headaches from the pressure. The headphones clamp on your head too much. I've tried to adjust them, but no luck, there's always excessive pressure. I ended up buying cheaper Sony headphones that don't sound as nice, but are extremely comfortable on my ears/head. I do not recommend these headphones. It doesn't matter how great they sound if you're getting headaches."
4,killer deal,"for 85 bucks shipped to my doorstep these headphones are a great deal. i'm not a bass junkie but had problems finding over ear headphones that sounded good.have owned other sennheiser products in the past and these headphones will not disappoint. have put on more comfortable headphones before but you'd have to pay twice as much.sound quality solid. if you're looking to find great over ears for less than 100 bucks, look no further."
2,Falls apart with normal use,"As others have written, the plastic bits on the headband start to crack, break, fall off, and finally the headphones break to the point of being unwearable. This happened just by putting them on my head or just wearing them. No abuse, just normal use. They do have great sound and were comfortable before they started to break."
4,Nice headphones for the money,"I've tried several headphones over the years, but like these the best so far. I'm allergic to the foam found in most headphones, but these have leather (simulated?) pads that do not cause dermatitis. They are enclosed, so noise isolation is pretty good. Response is nice and flat, though the bass sounds a little dead for some reason. Seems pretty accurate to me. Sensitivity is good so it works well with mp3 players, or any other source I've tried. I can wear these phones for several hours before my ears get sweaty and I get uncomfortable."
4,Not for metalheads,"First off, these headphones sound amazing. I'm just using my mobo's on-board sound driver, and they still sound great. I'm finding new stuff in CDs I've loved for years, now (particularly Tool's AEnima).I just have one small quibble. While the bass sounds great most of the time, it's pretty weak during bass-drops in heavy death metal/hardcore music. It's as though the headphones push down the volume for really low frequencies. Somewhat of a let-down. I tried adjusting my EQ, but to no avail."
5,great buy,"I've had these for four years now and they've been perfect. They're incredibly comfortable; I've worn them for literally an entire day with no discomfort. I love the sound quality as well. The snug fit really reduces a lot of the noise around you, enabling distraction free listening.They've held up incredibly well and I expect to use them for at least a decade. Doubtful that you could do better at this price point."
1,Are No Stars Possible?,"Use the money you save from buying these cans to purchase a couple bottles of Excedrin.As others have said the cups are definitely shallow and there is an incedible high pitched squeal that's just frequent and quiet enough to drive you absolutely insane. After less than an hour with these cans you feel like someone has slowly ground the heel of their boot on your ears like they were a discarded cigarette. Oh, and the squeal-induced headache...feels something akin to having somebody lightly thump your brain with a small anvil."
1,YUCK!,"I was sent a pair of the HD280 headphones to try out. At first I was impressed by the look and quality of the Sennheisers, but after compairing them to my FOH engineers Sony MDR-V700 Headphones... well, the sound quality of the HD-280's are just plain terrible. Everyone who listened to them, crew, band, all thought the same... the Sonys sounded better. The HD-280's mid range seemed cut and the high end is brutal. Stick with the Sonys..."
1,instant headache,"After trying on the headphones, I got an instant headache that lasted for 3 hours. They are too tight around your head and the top of the headphones is flat, not rounded. My husband thouht they were very uncomfortable. I never used them and sent them back."
1,DOA,"I ordered a pair of these headphones after reading numerous reviews about how comfortable and great sounding they were. Unfortunately, one channel was dead no matter what source I plugged them into. I also was shocked at how stiff and uncomfortable the ear cushions were. My sony MDR 7506's actually feel better, I doubt I would have kept the sennheisers even if they worked. Zzounds did send me a free-postage return label but it was close to a month that they sat on my $100"
2,"amazing sound, uncomfortable fit","What incredible sound! Crisp, clear, beautiful range between highs and lows. If only I could tolerate the way they feel on my head.The ear cups feel and fit just fine. The problem is the headband. As I hold it, it seems to be padded very well, but when I place the headphones on my head, it feels like a heavy piece of plastic resting on my bare skull. (*note to reader: between the plastic of the headband and my actual skull are the headband padding, my scalp, and a full head of hair.) I tried adjusting the headband, and shifting around the way they sat on my head, but I could never get comfortable.It's really too bad, because they are probably the greatest sounding set of headphones I've ever worn. I just can't stand to wear them."
4,Sweet deal!,"I edit my podcast, play WoW, and listen whisper vids on youtube and to audiobooks with these babies. It handles all these tasks well and these cans sound spectacular. I don't have the ears of an engineer, but in my experience, the highs are high, the lows are low, and the overall sound is hella rich. This British dude reading The Silmarillion to me sounds so freaking smooth and sexy-- I feel very accurate vocal reproduction.They seem to have gotten better over time, as if breaking them in made them sound even better. Other reviews reinforce this notion. They are well-built, comfortable on my big-ass oblong head, and user-serviceable; you can replace the pads and the cable if/when they wear out. I wager this is the last pair of these I will need to buy for a looong time. Worth a Benjamin, totally; based on the quality and ability to repair. Jump in! Don't be afraid of the price-tag and get some now. This is how the 1% hears s***"
2,"High Quality Sound, monster size cord","I purchased this headset for my 17 year old son who wanted to jam to some great music. He wanted the Ludicrous Soul Beats, which seemed like overpriced, low quality headsets, so I found these.Unfortunately, the cord, which isn't displayed, is something you'd expect from a sound studio. Big, long, bulky, probably durable, but not for walking around.If you're using these at home, they're probably great. But, don't expect to take them mobile."
5,awesome,"These headphones are awesome. I only use them for casual listening but they perform well above what i had hoped. The bass is slightly lacking, but seeing as these are flat response headphones, thats understandable. I'm no audiophile but i highly reccomend them. The lows, mids and highs are very balanced. overall, a very good product and worth the price."
5,Buy these instead of Sony 700's!,"If you are a DJ -- buy these before you even think about buying sony's 700's which are so INFERIOR! The 280's not only have excellent sound, but when it comes to wear and tear, they make it whereas the plastic parts on the Sony's will just crack and crumble. Believe me, I'm a club DJ that has been through 2 pair of 700's in 3 years, and refused to keep giving my money to Sony when they failed to make improvements (I've talked to customer service several times)."
2,Good Sound but VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,"I tried three different headphones:Sennheiser 280 ProSound was very good, especially after some burn-in. But VERY uncomfortable. Way too tight -- really clamp down hard on your head. This produces great isolation, and they're well built, but this is useless if you can't wear them. Note: I don't have a big head.Audio Technica ath-m30The sound on these was mediocre, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.Shure SRH440I think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch. And they are comfortable. Not as tight as the Senns and isolate almost as well, certainly well enough."
4,Sennheiser HD-280 Dynamic Collapsible Headphones,The headphones cancel out most of the area noise and sound great. They are a pain if you are only using one side. I like the fact they go flat for packing. They work for me.
5,durable and reasonably accurate sound for mid-level headphones,"These are mid-level headphones, and they have reasonably accurate sound, including HF and bass that many cheaper headphones do not do well. Whether you are a casual listener, a musician, or a sound guru, I think you'll be very pleased with these headphones for the price.They are also comfortable to wear, even for several hours at a time.Finally, these are a lot more durable than cheaper headphones. I broke two pairs of less expensive Sennheiser headphones before trying these. I first called Sennheiser to make sure the cable on these can be replaced -- they say it can be -- but so far I haven't needed to do so."
2,Way too tight!,"The sound quality is good and the noise reduction is great, but I can't wear these for more than twenty minutes without getting a headache from it squeezing my head too tight. I don't even have a big head."
3,Not the best for iPods,"Theses headphones are not the best for iPods or any portable MP3 players. They sound tinny, probably because the small players don't kick out enough juice to drive them adequately.They sound great when hooked up to my full reciever.They are also heavy, and the padding on the headband kind of dug in after prolonged use.3 Stars for the sound quality but not for the application and discomfort."
4,Decent headphones,These headphones are exactly what I was looking for.The sound is nice and the bass is adequate but not super heavy. I've been listening to all my old music again but now I'm hearing details I had never heard before!They seal tight enough around my ears so my noisy office environment doesn't prevent me from listening to music or getting my job done. I find the fit to be comfortable enough to wear for up to 7 hours with only short breaks for the bathroom and lunch. My ears do get a little warm but I'm sure that is common for this type of headphone.So far I have not seen any of the cracks in the headband reported by other users. I am being careful though because I have read those reviews.
4,Quality headphones,"I like the sound of these headphones a lot, but they are bigger and bulkier than I expected. I guess it was more of an impulse buy to replace my sony dj headphones, so I didn't do too much research. Sound quality is great for mixing and listening and whatever, but I don't plan on wearing them around outside of my house like I could with my old sonys. Overall, a good buy."
4,"Good sound, weak bass","I chose the HD280pro's after reading a few reviews off CNET and Amazon. This is the first pair of cans I've ever owned. I'm inexperienced with good sound, but the highs and mids are pretty good. The sound could have more clarity, its almost as if there's a slight ""veil"" over the music. They also don't go very loud when I use them with my sony mp3 player. The biggest problem I have with them is the weak bass. It's crisp and sounds great, but there's not enough power behind it for me to be satisfied. I'm looking for replacements at the moment. .Comfort-wise they're not bad. The ear cushions are great, never uncomfortable. I understand what people say about the vice grip feeling. It certainly feels tight at first. I've been using them for about two weeks and have gotten used to them, though. They're not bad phones at all and a novice music listener will like them, unless they prefer bass-heavy music."
2,"Good value, but bad bass and high notes","For the first year or so I had the headphones, I noticed nothing wrong with them. I guess I was so thrilled to have a set of ""pro"" headphones that whatever happened I blamed on the computer. However, after noticing that especially high notes did not come out crisply but instead were just scratchy static, and very low bass made the same static-y sound, I sent them to Sennheiser to have them replaced, thinking I must have damaged them somehow. The new ones are just as bad... I don't know why, but they are a fine set if you aren't annoyed at a bit of static, or if you arne't that picky, but quite honestly I wouldn't recommend them."
2,"SOUNDS great, but FEELS awful","I use these headphones for home recording and seriously I cannot wear them for more than 15 min, I get a huge headache, pain all around my ears from cut blood circulation and what not.VERY UNCONFORTABLE to a point where I want to get other ones, maybe the AKG's. And also don't think if you have a small head this will work for you, cause I have a small head and I am dying. If you plan on using these headphones regularly I suggest choosing another brand or I just say good luck!Having said that, the quality is great, but ergonomics and confort comes first, if I can't listen with them whats the point?"
2,Good sound but annoying,"Sounds great, hear all the noise. Ruins your MP3 collectoin like it should.Cord is too long and coiled too tightly, wraps around everything on set or in my office. Stuck in my office chair all the time. Bulky construction pulls itself down all the time and hurts my ears after a couple of hours, which I edit 9 hours a day on average so this kinds sucks. The jack is loose, all other headphones stay in my computers 1/4"" jack, these pop out with the slightest twist. Even with a annoyingly long chord it still manages to wobble out and either go into mono or just disconnect, and then get wrapped in my chair so I can't put them on again. Will not buy again, probably won't keep either."
2,not worth it,"the sound quality is quite poor. i had a cheap (10 dollar) headfone whose sound quality was lil better than hd-280's. this has quite a lot of blaring sound.for comfort, i would score this headfone a full five stars, but I guess that wont matter if the sound is not good."
2,disappointed !,"bought it two days ago. opened the box. burned it for 30 hours!!result : disappointed !!!really disappointed!!i read all the reviews of this headphone that are available on the internet. i spent 2 hours to research it. i thought it could be on the best headphone for the money. i played it with my mp3 player and computer. it sucks. it is not for music, just like the description, this is for monitoring!! never buy it if you are going to use it to listen to music. i will give 3 star for the sound ( so decent and standard ) and negative 10 for comfort!!!! it broke my jaws and made my head dizzy"
1,Liked the headphones but not for the money....,I actually liked this headphones i bought them from guitar center. The first pair they sold me were actually used the whole outer sole around the headphones where torn. I got them replaced and now I have the headphones for about 2 weeks now but the only way they work is if i fiddle with the cord and i have to keep it in the right place. This is something i expect from a $100 pair of headphones I am contacting them for my warranty....
3,OK...,"These are ok, they are huge... And not that cool in design of course... The cord is very long though.. It doesn't block sound all that good, and the bass is horrible...If I had a chance again... def would get bose or skull candy... Not worth what you pay... But if you're stuck with them, or get a really good deal on them, then they would do..."
4,Pretty good.,"I've been wanting to get into ""good"" headphones for quite a while, and decided to start with these.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality compared to some $15 pair from Walmart. There is much more detail and clarity with these headphones, it makes the cheap ones really sound cheap. The bass is well defined and the highs are crisp. They isolate pretty well too.My only problem with them is that, for me at least, they start getting a little uncomfortable after maybe 30 minutes, and my ears get a little warm. But it isn't too bad, it can be dealt with.I'm sure there are even more comfortable and clearer headphones out there, but for now, these will do just fine.4/5"
5,These things are beast,"I love these headphones, they came very fast, great packaging since it was new, had perfect order with them. No cons for the price and quality these are worth it. Wire was kinda long but thats not too big a problem. Good for people looking for true sound music could compare this with dre beats but these are cheaper and pretty good with better ranges so I love these though a bit heavy and big."
4,"Great sound, pretty comfortable","I bought these used from an amazon seller, and the plug was broken so I got a new pair from B&H. I'm crossing my fingers for the same problem not to arise again, but so far so good. They sound great, are pretty comfortable, have solid outside noise attenuation, and fold up for traveling. I'm a professional musician and am really happy with my choice so far. Definitely recommended!"
4,it came along slowly,"the burn-in for headphones is a real thing. This will be my third pair of headphones first were some Panasonic SE-20 in 68, then some yamaha YHD-2 the late 70's then came walkman and mp3 player and assorted earbuds then headphone amps like having a real stereo when you used real headphones. purchhased these puppies and the sound got better the long I used them the noise isolation is great when your roomate snores. the soundquality js sweet now."
5,Great monitoring!!,"I find it a little funny how some reveiwers comment on the lack of outstanding bass or treble on these headphones. They are, indeed, monitoring headphones. When I use these in my home studio, they are great for mixing and playback and give me a straight distribution of sound. If you are an avid music listener and are looking for good headphones for playing off your iPod or computer, then these are not the headphones for you! These headphones are made for monitoring and mixing in a studio, through a sound card or interface and man, I don't think there are any better headphone out there for the money. The good: makes monitoring and mixing easy. The bad: slightly uncomfortable if you don't have an average sized head."
3,Headphones,These headphones feel like concrete sitting on your head. The most uncomfortable headphones I have ever used. But the sound is good.
3,Great sound but uncomfortable,"I have used these for about a year now. These provide a nice balanced sound...not too bright and not too much bass either. Unfortunately, they squeeze the side of my head way too tightly, so they can't be used for prolonged periods. When I listen to music while I work, I find I need to remove the headphones before I'm ready to."
5,WE HAVE A WINNER!,"There are really 2 different headphones here: before and after burn-in. You DO need to play this baby for at least 2-3 days non-stop before they open up. The HD-280 are high-quality phones and very revealing, without being aggressive or clinical. Tape hiss on older recordings is enhanced but the sound remains truthful and musical acrosse the spectrum, with no exagerated frequencies, annoying overtones, or distortions. Classical/jazz listeners will be particularly pleased by what they hear.These cans are exceptional value and can be driven by just about everything. Headphones technology must have advanced quite a bit in the last 10 years. Whatever the case, I believe Sennheiser has a winner here.Now repeat with me: I WILL BURN THEM IN... I WILL BURN THEM IN... I WILL BURN THEM IN... I WILL BURN THEM IN..."
1,"i loved these headphones, BUT","I loved these headphones, but the plastic headband kept cracking. I went through three pair within a 3 month period and they all kept cracking. I finally exchanged the 3rd damaged pair for a new pair and sold them. The sound quality and noise blocking ability are outstanding. I really do like the product but the quality SUCKS. I don't like spending my money on something that isn't going to last."
3,Nice entry level phone,"Very even presence across its frequency range, high isolation, fairly subdued signature overall. Nice bass extension but very little impact prior to EQing (semi-bass-head here). I bought the ATH M50 for comparison and thought it better in every meaningful department sound-wise. Still, this is a nice can for the used price I paid."
3,"Good sound, but they hurt your head",The width between my wears is not more than average. But if you wear these for more than about an hour (say playing a video game so that your spouse doesn't get upset with all of the booms and crashes) your ears will ache. The sound is very good but you just can't wear them that long.
5,FANTASTIC SOUND QUALITY,"I purchased one of these headphones to use for listening to digial audio recorders used in my group's paranormal investigations. The sound quality is FANTASTIC! Using these headphones we were able to pick up 6 very distinct EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena)recordings, some very faintly whispered intelligent responses to questions and some residual phenomena which sounded as if the disembodied spirit were standing right in front of us. These headphones worked so well and at such a great price that we purchased a second set to use in our investigations. Great price and super fantastic sound quality!!!!"
4,Product Review Sennheiser HD 280 Pro,This product is of very high quality design and manufacturing. It is one of the most flat response headphones I have used. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a quality product in this price range.
4,amazing sounding headphones,"These headphones make my music on my ipod sound amazing! Crisp, clear sound & you cant hear any outside noise at all. Only problem is they are big, really big. Overall though, a great buy especially for the price!"
2,Poorly made,"These headphones produce decent sound quality. However, the plastic bar that holds them together is very poorly made. Mine broke after only a few months of infrequent use. These are definately not worth the high price for only a few months worth of use."
3,Value for money,"Positives : Good clarity, amble depth, rugged designNegatives : Still cant be compared to Bose, bass could have been more. Very heavy and grip is uncomfortable"
2,Uncomfortable,I found these very uncomfortable on the top of my head as soon as I put them on. They were returned without ever testing the sound but I have owned other Sennheiser headphones and they typically sound excellent.
2,Disappointing,"I dont know if the item i got was a fake. But it was quite shocking. It sounded tinny, and lifeless. There was no meat in the mids. I could hear a lot of details, but absolutely no punch. I honestly felt the current HD 202s that i have are much better and they cost just $30.I also have a HD 25-1 II. Those cost twice as much, and is 100 times as awesome. So maybe this is just a one off case."
4,Good for the price however can be damaged easily,"I bought these second hand in 2004 and have really liked having them. They sound fine to me. I must comment on their durability. If you like taking your headphones with you to work, the library or to the backcountry you are going to have to treat them with respect. My pair of HD 280's had the top pad part fall off and cracked panel on the upper bridge part of the headphone exposing a wire. I guess I'm partly to blame for not taking better care of the phones but there has got to be some phones out there than can travel without falling apart. Miraculously they are are still fully functional."
4,Excellent choice,"Having owned Sennheiser (HD477) previously, I had to search for a new set because the sound was lost on one channel. I traced it to the cable, but found it challenging to find a new cable. So after researching other headphones, I selected the HD280 pro. Now I really enjoyed my 477s, but the 280s surpassed them in every way except aesthetically. The 280s are quite stiff and I am sure will loosen up. But the sound is awesome. I enjoy all types of music, light jazz being my favorite. The sound from the headset is just excellent. I also like the noise elimination, far exceeding the 477s. I also like the way that they fold up for portability, moreso than the 477s. I am not easily impressed when it comes to sound, and I enjoy good sound. I am impressed with the 280s."
4,GREAT HEADPHONES,"Great headphones i bought them for my home studio and after an extensive research i picked these. They are perfect for in the booth and also when i just need to get work done without being loud...only thing i can say is that after wearing them for 2 + hours they will start to weigh down on your head and neck, but other than that they are pretty comfortable and sound excellent."
2,great sound- cheap plastic band,"fantastic sound- i do audio engineering and these are some of the best sounding phones i've used, especially for the price. also very comfortable and good at blocking external noise. too bad the plastic band basically cracked and started disintegrating after only a few months. if sennheiser would correct this problem, i'd replace mine in a hearbeat. unfortunately, tho, i can't recommend these because of the shoddy plastic design of the band."
3,great sound poor build quality,"a little after the 2 year warranty went out, my headphone started to develop small cracks near the head pad. i wish they addressed this flaw in the material of choice. plastic does not flex as good as metal. its too bad theres no competition in this price range. wouldnt mind paying extra for a metal support on the collapsible headset."
4,Great Headphones!,"Great sound. Not quite as good comfort as some of those overpriced Bose headphones, but certainly better than a lot of them out there. Nice that you can replace parts on it, though I haven't had them long enough to need any."
5,Superb closed back headphones!,These are fantastic closed ear headphones perfect for anyone who wants to keep the sound of whatever they're listening to contained. They have 35db or so of attenuation meaning anything under 35db around you will (in theory) be inaudible while wearing them. They have fantastic bass response and reproduce most of the musical range quite well. I have enjoyed several pair of these for around 10 years now and will always own some and use them when I want great musical reproduction and to keep anyone around me un-bothered :)
1,Jack Nicklaus 4 is outdated,"Jack Nicklaus 4 cannot be played on Mac X. When I tried my ancient Mac that had the classic system as a back up, it still didn't work. Kept getting an Error 120 message."
1,Don't Bother With This One!,"This film was slow moving and completely uninteresting. I didn't care about any of the people in it. As for the story line, what story line? This thing went on forever and was boring as hell."
2,Calpurnia is a dud (mostly),"The novel starts out well enough. An old matriarch with a scandalous past has died. The central character (Elizabeth)is set to manage the disposal of what is left of her estate. She meets various members of her family and some of her old friends and begins to unravel her past...Except it's not much of a past. The matriarch and everyone else is pretty boring. One relative likes to watch tennis on T.V. and ruminate on the state of the game in the mid 1980s. Haven't heard people talk about Ivan Lendl for a while...None of the two dozen characters is really very interesting and there isn't much of a climax.The writing is pretty good and there is some atomosphere...Best thing about ""Calpurnia""? The cover photo!"
2,Fizzles out,"Calpurnia starts off with a promising setting and characters who look like they could be interesting and believable, but the plot never thickens. In fact far from thickening, it sort of melts about a third of the way through, and trickles away in a real anticlimax.Anne Scott's writing style is dreamy and contemplative, not well suited for a thriller or whodunit, but that's okay -- I was expecting a gently unfolding and introspective sort of story, not a John Grisham novel. Any interesting leads Scott creates, though, seem to trail off in isolation from other plot elements, never connecting or impacting each other.Calpurnia is less a story than a collection of idle, non-urgent questions and answers about a family's life, and it never coheres into a whole that works."
2,Nine West Tote,The article I received had the fastener defective and was full of dust and ugly smelling; for the rest I cannot complain until now; for high costs on product return I keep it.
3,It doesn't have good bass,"I like the way it fits my head and my ears. It really does feel very comfortable wearing this headphone. Yet compared to my Sony headphone, which is even cheaper than this one, it doesn't have much bass as it should. I listen to hiphop a lot, so this is not very satisfactory."
3,"Good sound qulaity, but not for long term used.","I have had this headphone for three months and there are good and bad.The good part is that the sound quality is pretty nice (for this price) and the wire is pretty long so i am still able to move around the audio source.The bad part is that the headphone is pretty small. It does not ""go around"" the ear, instead, it sits on the ear. I consider my head smaller size and I wear glasses. So, when I wear this headphone, it really really makes me uncomfortable. I start to have headache after about one hour wearing this headphone.In summary, the sound quality is good, but i think this headphone is more suitable for children. If you are looking for something that is very comfortable that you can wear for a long time, then you have to look for something else."
3,Decent for the price. Don't expect higher end Sennheiser sound though.,"These headphones were okay. Bass response was really good. The mid and high ranges seemed muddier. After to listening for a while, the flat mids and highs got unsettling.They fit my head well once adjusted. Good tight grip around ears.Good for a $25 pair of headphones."
2,They hurt my head,"They sound good, especially for the price. They go over the ear and are very soft. I really wanted to like these headphones, because they're perfect for me otherwise, but for some reason, they hurt my head after only a few minutes of wearing them. I think they're just too tight, and there's no way to adjust how tight they are.I've tried breaking them in, but nothing has worked. I'm afraid they're useless to me now.I would strongly suggest trying on some headphones of this style before you buy these. If you think they might hurt you like they do me, don't take the risk."
2,toy cans,"As the price suggests, one shouldn't expect much. The plastic construction feels a bit fragile, definitely not something capable of taking much street abuse. Fit is very tight, not for extended listening sessions and people with larger heads. The sound is muffled and seriously lacking in highs (the model in question had been in use for several weeks and could be considered at least somewhat burned in), I would even prefer my super cheap Verbatim headset over these for a sharper sound. The 202s are probably ok for bass heads, but people preferring crispness and a wider frequency range sould look elsewere."
1,Ouch--my head!,"I have a pair of folding Sennheiser headphones that I love. The sound is unbelievable, and they fold up to fit into quite a small case. I was sure I was also going to love the 202s, and since I am a woman with--I had always thought--a medium-sized head, I didn't anticipate comfort problems. I just tried these for the first time, to watch a video that was 33 seconds long, and could hardly wait until the 33 seconds had passed and I could take these terrible things off my already aching noggin. They were dreadfully uncomfortable--way too tight! I am going to return these and go back to the drawing board."
4,best headphones for price,"great sound with nice bass. but the price for this product is the best part. definitely get your money's worth. a few of my coworkers bought this as well and they love it. gave it four stars though because my ears do get slightly warm after some time of usage. maybe if they had perforated covers or such for ventilation, that would've definitely given another star to my review. overall though, great product."
2,Not for people with big heads,"The sound quality is excellent for the price, however if you have a big head, you might want to look elsewhere, because the headphonse put a lot of pressure on your head.I've got an above average-sized head (7 3/4 male hat size, for reference) and get headaches/pains from the pressure put on my head by the headphones. They just cannot be expanded far enough to prevent this. The headphones should be great for average-sized heads though."
2,You get what you pay for....,"I bought these with hopes of good sound quality at a reasonable price and unfortunately, they did not deliver. I have an expensive headset for my computer that has a usb plug, and I needed something with a 1/8"" plug so I got these, and they are not very good. I recommend some sony over ear head-phones like you used to see people use with their CD players over these. Just my opinion"
2,keep searching,"even though they were relatively inexpensive, they should last longer than 6 months. the cord was flimsy and just wore down, making my left headphone go completely dead - sucks for audio period, but esp when there are pans/surround sound effects. i read reviews that the bass was pretty low-quality, but it was actually worse than i had braced myself for. not to mention the overall sound quality ran too quickly into 'bleed' mode. the actual part that went over my head was a bit awkwardly designed and inflexible as well. the best part of this headphone set was the long cord, which actually bordered on being too long. i guess if you don't plan to listen to anything with complexity, and don't plan to take them anywhere or wrap up the cord (which i am INFAMOUS for doing with meticulous care), then purchase away, otherwise, keep shopping."
2,Whatever,"I bought these headphones and about a month later, they give out on me so now I have to pay for another set of headphones. GRRRRRR!!! They worked great while they were working then the next day, they don't. I didn't crush them or anything. They just stopped working. Don't get these phones they suck big time."
1,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,Sound is OK but these are ear killers if worn more than 15 minutes. Cord is always in the way (I much prefer a coiled cord)
4,Pretty good.,So far the headphones are pretty good. I bought another pair to give tomy sister for her Birthday.
4,bass pumpers,well they are good. they put out alot of bass. sometimes the bass seems to much. i had to play with them to get them sounding right. They fit me perfect and block out alot of sound. They are not noise cancellation but still do a good job. i say if you listen bass filled songs buy them if not buy something else. They don't look big on your head either which is nice because i had some old ones and they were huge. The cord is long i think almost ten feet long. They give a cord gather to keep it in check. I would recommend it.
3,"Don't last long, but worth it anyway.","For the price, these are excellent headphones. I just ordered my second pair. After two years, the wires frayed, one earphone went dead. But at this price you can simply order up a replacement and factor that into the deal because they're excellent. The long cord might prove to be a problem for ipod use."
1,Disappointed,"I gave these headphones light-duty use. Good sound but poor construction. The wire came out of one of the earpieces after 6 months and the company wanted an exorbitant price (compared to the purchase price) to fix them. I didn't think it was worthwhile to do that.I've switched to a cheap set of headphones from my CD player. When they go bad, I can toss them out and use another pair."
1,really a zero star rating,"at first i thought these headphones were great. but, only after 2 months of use these headphones no longer function properly. they only function properly if i push down on the plastic casing surrounding the audio connector.i know somebody may say, ""what do you expect at this price?""still, i am so shocked by the poor quality of these headphones i will probably never buy any sennheiser headphones again. these headphones are so poor, it reflects badly upon sennheiser and amazon.i am recommending that nobody should ever buy these headphones. and i am recommending that amazon should no longer sell these headphones."
4,A Weird Review...,"Do you know how the way that many of life's experiences work--event's that you expect to be awesome memories, end up filled with nonsense, and the ones that you anticipate displeasure, become fond moments to reminisce about?I had a similar experience with the Sennheiser HD-202s...I expected awesome balance for use while recording my music, but instead got imbalance in the midbass to upper frequencies seeming unnecessarily dampened...Sensitivity of which I expected to be grand...ended up needing serious attention by my audio receiver...oh yeah, and by the time that it was up to a good volume...the diaphragms felt it necessary to become unstable.Come to think about it...I've given it fourstars simply because of the name...'though it was my first mistake in the first place...Look around...and save more money...Gen"
1,It would be nice is they would have sent me a pair that wasn't broken.,"I bought from a used seller, and although they look nice one of the speakers is already broken but apparently I can't get a refund since they are used? Not so happy with these, I'd suggest buying a new pair of sony's instead."
5,Hard to beat these for the money,"These are fantastic cans for the money. The sound is not quite as precise or spacious as my Sennheiser HD 280s, but at 1/3 the price of the 280s, it's hard to complain.I like the long, un-spiraled cord and the simple, comfortable design."
3,"Good sound quality for the money, not comfortable","Sounds great for the cost, and at least appears to be durable. But, despite being of average size in this department the earcups are too small. Can't be worn for any period of time. Also, could use some kind of cord-management system-- cord is too long for use with shirt-pocket MP3 player."
3,crappy sound in right side,"it's not totally dead on the right side, but it's much lower volume than the left.it was like this from day one. wouldn't buy it again."
3,Broken easily,"I have owned two of this headphones. The 1st one, which was also purchased from Amazon, lost sound in one ear after using for two years or so, without any noticeable sign of faultiness except no sound and I ordered another one from Amazon because I liked this headphone for its sound quality and comfort. After 15 months, the 2nd broke again, much faster than the 1st one, this time the line wears off and was broken at the connection to the earpiece. I think I am not going to order one more of this kind any more."
3,They're ok,"Although very cheap compared to some headphones, they are far from comfortable, after about 15-20 minutes of wearing them they make my head heart from being too tight since they don't have a width adjustment. I would recommend saving a bit more money, and investing on a better set."
3,My ears are too big,"I didn't think my ears were that large, but apparently they are too big for these over-the-ear headphones. They didn't cover my ears so it was hard to hear. I work as a transcriber so a good set of headphones is a must. These didn't provide the sound quality I needed to do my work. For music, I suppose they work well. I was hoping they would have better sound but for just listening to music, they're alright."
3,Right side doesn't work anymore,"I had these for about a year and I can't really comment on how ""great"" the sound is since I just use them. The right side just stopped working so I might get another pair of headphones soon."
3,Mixed feelings,"Bought these because I read about the brand and these were the most affordable headphones.But to be very honest, they arent very comfy. They have this odd oval shape that doesnt sit on the ears right.And the part that holds the earpieces together isnt exactly well designed.Sound quality I cannot compare, as I have used small ear buds so far, so this is much better.The cable is very very long, which is quite useful but kind of inconvenient. Especially lugging around the plastic piece that the cable winds around. Irritating.Overall average product, I would rather something more comfortable."
5,[...] Quality Headphones That Balance the Budget,"Highly recommended for those who invest in music. Comfortable, durable, the HD202 Headphones tend to last 1.5 years before one of the earphones go out due to a damaged wire; very few headphones would last a year in my household with the rough treatment from pets and children. I cannot tell you how many times a day they are dropped from the desk to a hardwood floor yet survive without problem. This purchase was my forth owned pair, on a frugal budget I couldn't suggest a product better."
3,Had to send them back - not for long term use,"I didn't have extremely high expectations for these headphones. Basically I wanted something to use at work for long periods of time. My current ones are old sony's and need some re-soldering, so I figured I'd pick up two pairs of these - the price is right.I have an average sized head and these things squeeze my head very tightly. In addition, the ear pads are too small to go around your ear, so your ear lobe and the top of your ear are get sandwiched between the headphones and your melon. Definitely not for use for long periods of time -- fine for the first 15 minutes (kind of... still uncomfortable)."
3,"Good sound for average use, but too tight a fit","I don't have any complaints about the sound, they sound good. Only problem is that they become uncomfortable to wear after about a half hour. The ear cups are too small and the fit is tight, so your ears start hurting as they are being mashed against your head. I've got a pretty average head and ears, so unless you have little ears or not using these for more than 30min at a time, I'd go for another pair."
5,great value and sound,Great sound. I can hear things in my colection that I never heard before (in a good way).
3,Feels cheap,"I ignored tales of caution regarding this because of the remarks I'd heard regarding the sound on these cans, and they are pretty good. I didn't spend time measuring how warm it is or anything because I found these incredible uncomfortable. The phones them selves can with not much effort be popped off of the main headband, which itself is very tight on the head.They do have great sound from what I gathered in my months having them, but these headphones feel cheaply made and aesthetically are not too pleasing. You're not going to want to wear these in public."
2,Cheap,I expected so much more from these headphones but they are cheap sounding and not durable. I would not buy these again.
4,"Good headphones, not very comfortable.","The sound quality is good (not great) and they feel durable and well constructed. The problem is that the pads do not completely cover your ear lobes which makes them uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time (2+ hours). I do not consider my ear lobes to be large and if you look at the picture closely, you'll see that the shape of the ear pieces is oval. If they had just made them completely round then these would fit much better and then they would be the best value headphones out there. UPDATE: I have had these for several months now and they feel more comfortable now that they have broken in. Still not perfect but beter so I increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars."
3,Tight is right,"I bought this even after reading some reviews that said it was horribly tight. I didn't see consistent reviews of this problem so I decided to try it for sound quality instead. Unfortunately, the too-tight comments were correct. I've never had a pair of earphones hurt my ears, but these are unbearable after about 45 minutes to an hour and I constantly have to shift them around. I'd give even less than 3-stars, but I found that if you reverse the earphones (so the 'L' pad is on your right ear...just a nice 180 spin) they fit very well, cup around your ear instead of pressing it, and still form a good seal...I can now wear them indefinitely without pain. I wonder if Sennheiser just has someone in their manufacturing department that doesn't know left from right..."
4,"Good Price, Good Product","I have no complaints about these headphones. For the quality, they are relatively inexpensive. They're very comfortable and block out background noise (which is a big plus when living in the city.) The only thing I think they could have improved on was making them fold able for easy storage, but that's not really a big deal.I give them four stars."
3,Ok headphones for the price,"I just received these headphones this morning, and i would say they are incredibly average, and do not provide the sound quailty of previous Sennheiser headphones i have owned. However at $25, they are pretty cheap so i cannot complain too much.A couple of initial observations, they do not have much bass, and depending on what kind of music you listen to, that may or maybe be a problem. If you listen primarily to rap/hip-hop you should probably give these a miss.Also they are not particulary comfortable for extened periods. They are probably ok for a 30 minute subway ride, but for listening all day, these are probably not suitable.So overall very average, as i write this review, i am debating about returning them and getting something else"
1,Not comfortable,The Sennheiser HD202 headphones just aren't comfortable. The over-the-ear pads did not fit completely over my average sized ears. They also fit a bit too tight on my head. I could only wear them for short periods of time before feeling discomfort. It is a shame because the headphones do deliver good sound quality. I ended up replacing them with the JVC HARX500 headphones. These comfortably fit over my ears and don't give me a headache.
4,Great Quality At A Reasonable Price,"These are the best headphones that I have used by far. They are reasonably priced and the sound quality is much better than those cheap headphones that come bundled with MP3 players. With these headphones, the facets of each music track are much clearer. The only knock is that these headphones do get painful to wear after numerous hours of use. You may want to try adjusting them for best comfort. There are numerous headphone products with even better quality, but given the price I am overall satisfied with my purchase of these headphones."
3,"Nice, but not durable","This were great headphones for only $18, but unfortunately they are now driving me nuts after only 6 months. Sound keeps going bad and I have to wiggle the plug to fix it. There's a bad connection in there somewhere. But, I going to assume I got a lemon and give the updated model another chance."
2,Too tight!,Headphone squeezed my ear and head too much. I felt quiet numb later but I can never like it.It lasted about a year.
3,"OK, blocks sound well. NOT FOR TRAVEL.","These are sturdy headphones and if you need a long cord and you will be working at home with these mainly, THESE ARE GREAT. My problem is I wanted to travel with him and listen to my ipod with them, and the cord is simple too LONG. it's just huge and it's too hard to use. That my only real complaint with these, just the cord. Everything else works well. My husband likes these when he has work and their are kids in the house. They block the noise really well...I just can't really take them out anywhere."
3,Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones,"I concur with other reviewers that these headphones are a bit heavy on the base.The fit is a bit tight.This is the only manufacturer of headphones that I have encountered that publishes THD. I appreciate that, and it was a major factor in my purchase.Considering everything, it is well worth the price."
4,Worth the money,"I got these cans when they were available for less than $20 so I say they are wholeheartedly worth the cost. From various reviews I've read on lower end Sennheiser cans there seems to be a recurring problem of comfort, durability, and consistency in product design. My set has held up just fine, and I have to say that they were not comfortable and easy to wear immediately to the fact that the padding seems to be not quite big enough to fit completely around the here or comfortably rest on the ear.Over time I've gotten used to how they fit and the sound quality seems to be adequate for a pair of <$30 headphones. Good but not great sound, good but not great comfort. Easily portable but can sometimes feel a little fragile and cheap. Mine have held up for 3 or 4 months now, so I can't complain. Good for on the go Cans, just be sure to break them in before you take them for a long flight or car ride as they might not be the most comfortable or best quality right away."
5,"Great Headphones, Great Price","I've had these headphones since Dec 2008. I use them at work, when I'm on my lunch break. Awesome sound with my Ipod Touch, and the output is so good, I can use these headphones as a speaker when connected to the headphone jack on the computer, when I'm showing friends youtube videos, and I want them to listen in. Hi fidelity, good bass, and very long cord (which some might consider excessive). People tease me that I'm old school, but once they hear the sound quality, they are convinced. Only thing I don't like is because I wear glasses, the headphones press a little tight on my head, and then it feels somewhat sore around my ears after about 45 minutes. But other than that, this is the BEST deal going for headphones. Was surprised that these were made in China, since this is a respected German brand. Definitely worth the price!"
4,Best product for the money!,"I bought these head phones almost a month ago now. I wanted to use them at work to try and block out some of the noise while listening to music/audio books. They were cheap, DO block out sound quite well, good sound quality, and are pretty comfortable. The only thing I would change about them is to make the cushions a bit deeper so the top of your ear doesn't touch after wearing them for a while. But I can wear them for 7-8 hours at work with decent comfort. GOOD BUY!!!!"
3,Lacking bass,"Tried these out at FYE. They're comfortable and have clear sound but lack bass. Not the best for rap, dubstep, etc."
5,Amazing,"These are great headphones for the money. I use them all the time and the sound is amazing! They come with a really long cord which is great for walking around, or having them plugged in on the other side of the room."
1,Not recommended!,You will get good sound from these headphones. But the the wires (from both sides) will break from just normal daily use after about 8 months. Now I am stuck with unrepairable junk. I guess $25 gets you 10 months of headphone use nowadays. Would steer clear of these from now on.
2,Painful!,"The HD202 sound is more than adequate for my application (non-critical listening in an office environment), but comfort is not. They are MUCH too tight on my ears to wear for much more than 30 minutes. If you have a narrow head and/or smaller-than-average ears, you may well be pleased. But if you have had trouble with too-tight 'phones in the past, you might want to look further."
4,Great headphones,"Got it cheap during thanksgiving. The sound quality is just amazing. I love the songs in my library even more. It feels a little uncomfortable after prolonged usage, my ears began to hurt a little bit, but after couple of minutes of rest, it becomes OK to put them back on.The main thing about a headphones is the sound quality after all. These exceeded my expectations. Additionally, the cord is long and it comes with the bigger size jack that I can use with my Onkyo Receiver.I use them extensively at work and successfully avoid any background noise.Would recommend this one to anybody who is looking for a cheaper yet quality alternative to the more expensive BOSE ones."
3,Decent pair,Pros---------High Quality SoundSturdy ConstructionLong ChordCons---------Gets uncomfortable wearing them for a long time. I have small ears and head. I tend to used them for long gaming sessions.Bass is sub-par.Not very portable due to lack of folding features.
3,"Good value, bulky","Good value. They look bulkier on than they look in pre-purchase photos, re-winder is not 'auto-retract' and is cumbersome. Sound quality great! Actually feel good about purchase based on price."
4,Nice & Loud (for use with PC),"I can actually hear the dialogue on the NetFlix movies that I watch online, this probably doesn't seem like a big deal... but I couldn't really hear the dialogue with the old headphones (from Koss). Sometimes I actually have to turn the volume down (I never had to do this before), of course, I am 52 and I do have some hearing issues (but not with these headphones). I highly recommend these headphones (to anyone/everyone)."
4,Excellent Investment,"OK, I will try to make this short! In simple terms, these are easily some of the best, if not the best, over the ear headphones that you can currently buy under $100. The cups are a bit small, but I have medium sized ears and they have worked perfectly so far, so as long as your ears are not huge, they should fit perfectly. The build quality on these headphones is excellent. As far as sound quality goes, these headphones have a similar sound to older walkman style headphones, but with a less muddy sound. Lows are strong but not overly emphasized, mids are clear, and highs blend in well with the rest of the spectrum and are not overly harsh. Overall, it is a very pleasing sound. My one warning is that these headphones have a cord that is about 10ft long, which is perfect for my usage but may be too long for some people. Overall, an excellent product!"
4,First set,"This is my first set of headphones. I did quite a bit of research online and went to various local stores to try different ones on. Had it for about two months now and I'm very pleased. Quite comfortable, is adjustable to fit your head. One thing I've noticed though is that when you're listening to it while you're lying in bed, it hurts too lie sideways resting on your ear. Other than that though I haven't had any issues. As I said, this is my first pair, so I don't have much experience with the sound quality, but I'll give it a try. The bass is better than on your standard earphones and computer speakers, but still lacking a lot of ooomph. Everything sounds much better with these, and you'll begin to notice sounds in the songs that you've never noticed before. Very clear and crisp.I like these a lot. Go ahead and buy them"
5,Perfect headphones for an aiplane,"These are great for taking on a plane, or traveling in general. They are not as compact as earbuds, but still portable enough for most travelers. The quality of the sound for the price is great. I was surprised by the bass coming out of these."
3,Good sound with EQ processing,"These headphones have ALOT of bass response. If you listen to them with something without any tone adjustments, like an equalizer for example, don't expect flat, uncolored response. Now if you do add some tonal adjustments to them via an equalizer (cutting some low and lower mid frequencies) they are very respectable sounding. They are also very efficient, basic onboard computer output easily drives them. For the money, they are a decent value. I personally would have liked a less bass boosted response from the factory, but with adjustments they are fine. Comfort is very similiar to other closed type headphones I have experienced over the years; they need to be moved slightly around after wearing for awhile or they tend to get uncomfortable. All in all they are pretty decent for this price range.**After a few days/hours of use, they will break in, and the boomy mids/bass smooth out. Great sound for the money, they do become more comfortable with more use as well."
4,Good But Could Be Better,These a a pretty good pair headphones they sound good and no irritating noises i have had these for a while and when i bought them i thought man $22 what a deal and it was a a good deal but they could be better i wish they noise canceled a little better and the cord wasn't so long it comes with a thing to wrap up the cord but i lost that but i just keep most of it in a rubber band my only other complaint is that the tip bends so i can only hear in one ear unless i bend it back and i have to do it all the time but besides all of that i think it was a good buy and they make a good pair of headphones.
3,Its true: doesn't fit all heads!,"I thought what the hell...!I'm short, it'll fit my head. But nopes.its a real tight fit.I think most males will have a problem with the fit.Sound quality is awesome> keeps the bass intact.long cord umm....not really for the average guy-olny good if you work with it.belt clip-waste of plastic.value for money for people with smaller craniums.5 stars for quality/3 overall!"
5,great buy,"if your looking for great quality headphones at a low price these are the headphones for you i researched online for the best headphones for under $60 and every site i found rated these as the best over ear headphones for the price if your looking for good earbuds go with skullcandy ink'd earbuds if price is not an issue and your willing to blow ALOT on the best over ear headphones you can buy then dont buy these buy the sennheiser HD 800 headphones but if your on a budget get these you will be very happy with them the only problem i have had with them is the longgggg cord they send it with a plastic cord round up with a belt clip that works well but for me i already have alot on my belt already (cellphone, pda, psp, ipod, and now a cord round up as well but GO FOR IT!!!! its a good item dont rate them untill you have used them for afew days as the drivers need time to break em in alittle the band will lossen up the drivers will work them selves out and they will sound amazing!!!!!"
2,"Here today, gone tomorrow",I was really looking forward to getting these. I am going into hospital for about 5 days and wanted to cancel out hall and other noises. I put them on and almost immediately the right earphone started to crackle and then lost almost all sound. The foam earpieces also got warm very fast. So dissapointed...
2,These are for Bass...NOTHING MORE,"When the box said ""Strong Bass"", they meant it. Don't pay mind to the marketing team's generic word replacements, like ""strong stereo"" and ""dynamic"" and all that other bull. What you gotta look for is ""great base/treble balance"".These phones, while very comfortable to wear, are a nightmare to listen to. Not that they're THAT bad, but they're JUST for bass. If you want to listen to nothing but bass beats, buy this now. If you listen to REAL music, don't give these a second thought. The bass is just overpowering and with the (still comfortable) seal it makes around the ear, the pressure sort of hurts if you're playing music too long. But that's just me. Maybe I'm a priss. I dunno. But I know classical, techno, jazz, and rock, and this made that music......simply put: sound bad.Pros: Comfortable, nice price for the size and materials used, LONG cordCon: Not music headphones--BASS headphones. Remember this.I'm returning mine tomorrow."
3,"Good Sound, Horrible Build Quality",These suckers sound pretty good for the money.These suckers are pretty comfortable for the money.These suckers won't last very long. There are multiple build defects that will cause one of the cans to stop working.In the end I don't think it is worth the purchase if they are going to fail in less than a year. I would recommend that you spend a bit more money for a product that will last a while longer.
4,Good Choice for the $,"I have had these for one day and already love them. They work very well for their pricepoint and fit nicely. I like that I do not need to turn up the volume to hear the music well, as I did on my set of ear-buds. Thanks to all the other detailed reviews that helped convince me to give these a try. If you are looking for light, easy wearing headphones for non-professional use, these are worth the money."
4,"Big bass, nice everything else","The bass in these headphones took me a while to get used to. However, after a few weeks of listening in these headphones, I started missing their bass response listening through other headphones/speakers. The remainder of the frequency spectrum is well reproduced to. The quality is pretty solid. I have bent them, dropped them, abused the cable in everywhich way, and they still work like new. Not bad at all!"
1,"4 out of 4used by 4 different people broke within 3 months, all in the same place","Thinking they are a great value, I bought 2 of these to give as Christmas gifts to people at work, and a colleague did the same thing. In all respects, these were 'just average', a bit heavy and 'warm', but well worth the money at first. However, all 4 had the cord break at the right earpiece within 2-3 months. As they are used by different people, some of which are very careful with their stuff, this is not because they are handled roughly. They were, however, used for several hours 5 days a week."
5,best for the money,"if u want headphones that isolate you from outside with great quality, all for <$25, this is it. these have great bass response, and the best midrange and highs u'll get for the money. there're also the sennheiser hd-212 pro's, but i think they're too similar to justify the extra money. and these headphone's aren't too tight for me...they need to be reasonably tight to isolate, but even after extended (3+ hours in one sitting) use and wearing glasses im not severely discomforted. i havent figured out how to remove the earcups (they're removable but dont come with instructions on how that ive found) but there's no real need to for most. they're good for the dorm room computer or at a library, since they're sealed and dont let sound in or out. comes with a belt clip cord windup thing cuz the cord is really long, and a 1/8 mini to phono converter."
2,So THAT'S why they were only $20,"I bought these headphones based on the 4 1/2 ratings on here. However, I'm not sure how these headphones got ratings this high based on my experience. The sound quality is horrible. When I'm listening to music on my phone the backround is constanly obscured by a static-type noise. At first I thought it was the phone, but I plugged in another pair of headphones and no noise. You have to turn up the volume to drown out the static noise. On especially soft parts of songs, you may not be able to hear at all.The comfort of the fit is the other terrible quality of this product. The earphones never fit quite right and I could never find a comfortable position for them. Also because you had to turn up the volume to hear parts of the songs over the static, it didn't take too long for your ears to be hurting and you need to take the headphones off.I knew I was taking a chance by buying $20 headphones, and on this occasion, I got burned."
2,Not pleased,"I'm no techie but I know what sounds good and...I was not impressed by these. I should have known by the price, but the reviews were so generally positive I thought I'd give them a shot. First, they are not comfortable and start to pinch the ears in a relatively short period of time. Second, the sound leaves A LOT to be desired. I suppose they're okay for DJays who just need to hear a cue, but for the consumer who wants depth and distinction, these are not it. I want to hear each instrument and background vocal come through. (Yes, that is possible for less than $100.) Maybe part of the problem is that I previously owned the Senn HD212 Pro and I loved those. Great sound quality and they're just one generation up from the 202s. I didn't expect there to be such a noticeable difference. And the 212s were comfortable and lasted a few years before I came to this recent purchase. Should have stuck with what I knew."
2,Maybe I Got A Bad Pair?,"Looking back at the rave reviews, I see why I made the purchase, but my experience is so different I'm wondering if the reviews are rigged! The noise cancellation is none existent when music is not playing. Honestly, I might as well not have anything on my ears! But what bothers me the most is that my music can be heard blasting out of the headphones when listening. I tried using these headphones for recording and the music leaking from the headphones is picked up very loudly in the mic. So, if you are looking for a set that doesn't allow everybody in the room to hear what you're listening to, then look elsewhere, because these are not it.The other thing that annoys me is that the wire, while very long, ALWAYS gets tangled. The sound is okay, but the constantly tangling cord and the noise leakage really ruins these for me. So, needless to say, I am on the hunt for a better pair of headphones."
3,"What I wanted, but not hugely impressed","I purchased these headphones knowing that they were inexpensive. For my money, I received a good quality set of headphones.However; I am not 'wowed' by them and that is ok.While I liked the thought of a long cord, at the moment it is a complete pain when I have to have a very heavy chunk of wrapped up cord in between my ears and the iPhone on the desk, just waiting to slide off the desk as I move around and then pull the iPhone w/ it. It bites.I will need to purchase some sort of cord wrapper. On the plus side, should I need the length, it has it in spades!The comfort is good enough, I can listen for a while. The comfort isn't so good that I loose knowledge that I have them on, I find them a little tight pressed up against my ears.I recommend the headphones, just be aware that with the benefits, come a few gotchas."
2,Great Headphones which just DON'T LAST,"I bought a pair of these last March and they lasted about 9 months, NEW. The left side just went out while listening. No way to fix it, garbage. I kept good care of them too, never twisting the cord, special case for them and everything. Were nice while they lasted but just don't last. schade."
3,On my third pair,"I have to say first of all that I love these headphones. They are very comfortable and the fit is great for everyone in my home. I only wish they would last longer. I am right now buying my third pair in a year's time. The past two pairs have easily stripped wires and the left ear loses sound. This last pair has only lasted a few months, but for the price and quality of sound, for now I will continue to replace these. I hope the company catches on the problem and makes the cords more durable. Mine are used strictly for the computer so it's not like they are in use for travel. I would more than likely have to go with something different if that were the case."
3,Not Circumaural!,"How can you go wrong with over 600 reviews and an average score of 4.5 stars? Well, I went wrong. I trusted some peoples reviews about the comfort of these. They do not cover your ears, meaning, the padding rests on your ears pressing the cartilage down. You have to have baby ears for them to cover. All this talk about big ears or small ears is junk. Don't listen to it. If you want a pair of headphones that go AROUND your whole ear, these are not the ones. Sennheisers Audiophile headphones are the ones that cover, such as the HD555 set.Aside from that, I really didn't play with these much. The sound was good, but the bass was too strong for my preference. The cord was quite long too, which I think is a good thing.If a pair of headphones isn't comfortable, then it doesn't matter how good they sound. If you can't wear them, they're worthless."
3,Sound quality is pretty good but no fun to wear,"Pros: The sound quality is pretty good but nothing that will blow you away. But do give it some time to break in. I'm glad that the cord is very long (3m/10feet) so that I can watch movie from my big screen desktop HD monitor while lying on my bed. Many of the headphones out there have short cables.Cons: Unfortunately, the headphone is too uncomfortable to wear for longer duration (I've an average ear size, I guess). The ear cups put force on my ears and I have to constantly readjust it when I wear for more than 15-30mins. The cups could have been a little more spacious and cushioned for more comfort. On the flip side, this looks compact compared to some other top headphones out there.Other thoughts: I tried very low frequency sound test (high bass) and the headphone started crackling. Crackling stayed for some time even for general audio but sound became normal after a while."
5,The Best,"I love these headphones. The quality of the sound is enough to make me chase this gadget all across cyberspace, because my iPod is utterly useless without them."
5,great headphone for first time buyer,"i feel really glad of buying this wonderful product... since this is my first headphone ever, i was searching for good one worth for my money. HD202 is all about great sound quality, bass etc. it fits comfortably to my ears and didnt feel that i am having headphone on my head!!!!!!!!!!!!."
3,Average and inexpensive.,"Excellent sound, but not adjustable, and they are very tight on my head. Can only wear for a short time."
4,good value headphone,These Headphones are great!!! For the price they rock. I was tired of those cheaper phones and spent a lil extra- the purchase was totally worth it. Before I got them I honestly read every single review on Amazon. My head is like medium sized and never had to place them in a book to make them fit.I usually have them on for about an hour then let my ears breathe.I will recommend that you try them and you will like!Cons:* too much cord (the harness is cumbersome)* they warm ur ears in humid conditionsPros:* you cannot beat the price- good value* long cord again but too much at the same time* when I turn them all the way up they nibble on my ears(like foreplay with my ears)* they are Sennheiser and a good brand* it comes with an adapter even if I don't use it* they partially block out ambient noise when in use
4,Pretty good for a portable headphone,Comfortable and light. Okay sound quality. I tried it indoors for my electic piano and realized its sound quality shortcomings compared to my bulky Sennheiser headphones. But for outdoor walking use I thought it was fine.
5,Worth every penny,"Bought these from Amazon (awesome shipping of course, wish they could get that NY state tax off :-( ), blown away by the quality of sound! Got these for my Zune HD, which I thought sounded great with the stock headphones, I was so so wrong. Bass, mids, highs are great, feels comfortable around my head and on my (big) ears (I hate in-ear headphones). Granted I'm not sure how these compare to the 2-300 dollar headphones in terms of audio quality, but for 26 dollars, can't be beat. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Buy,"I record my own music on Garageband and Protools and when I want to ""show off"" my compositions, I like to hand my friends these headphones and say ""listen to this."" Not only does my music sound better but every time they are blown away by these headphones.They are formulated for extended range so the highs and lows are exaggerated which is killer for digital music especially electronica, beat, hip hop, etc. They are comfortable to wear and have an extra long cord which allows me to move around while wearing them. I have several pairs of $100+ headphones but these are my favorite. Sennheiser has always been a great company but I never knew I could own a pair of their headphones for $25. I bought two. Great buy."
2,Meh,"I bought this based on its reviews - wanted a cheap but decent sounding set of headphones to just leave at my desk so I wouldn't feel too bad if they got lost/stolen. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for $20, but the audio quality on these headphones is really poor. Not enough midrange, tinny trebles and severely boosted, boomy bass. Leaves me with the impression that I'm listening to music in a small metal box. My cheap PC speakers sound better! Avoid."
4,Not Recommended,I bought these headphones and were one of the best headphones ive used on sound quality but a couple months later one of the speakers blew out so quickly and regret buying these headphones not recommended!!!!
4,"A little small for some, perhaps","I got these headphones for my kids mostly (12 years old), and they seem to like them, so that's a success (they use them in the car to listen to iPod and watch DVDs). However I would warn prospective buyers that I think they are a little on the small side for adults. My wife and I both feel that they are bit small and tight if we try to wear them. But the kids are happy, and that was the intention.The headphones I use myself at home as Sennheiser HD-555's. A little more money but I'm very happy with them.Brian"
4,Great Headphones for the Price,"You can't buy a better set of headphones for the price. While they might not be comfortable enough for long hours of continuous wear, these headphones sound great and have an extra long cord to allow freedom of movement.I've only had these for a month, but durability looks pretty good, simple slide mechanism to adjust to your head and cushioned ear cups don't appear cheap or fragile."
4,Really Good....,"This headphone is really superb. I love it.. The only problem i think this headphone has is that, u can't use it for a very long time. The ears start aching. Apart from that the sound quality is superb, the noise cancellation is good.. overall a really good headphone.. worth more than its price.."
5,A MUST buy headphones,"I am the proud owner of this awesome headphones. I have had this headphones for 8 months now. I listen to music everyday anywhere from 6-8 hrs. I love using this little toy, very comfortable, the cable is long that you can easily manage to sit a meter away from your laptop. With increasing use, the sound quality seems to get better! I have compared this one with other headphones which my friends have, no other headphone below $70 comes even close to this. The maximum output is almost twice the other headphones. I totally recommend buying product unless you have plans of buying headphones in higher range. You will not be regret buying this product."
5,Nice headphone,"Overall these are good headphones. I've beening using it for 4 years. The only problem is that the ""leather"" began to fall off beneath the top part.Pros:good sound qualityLight weightDurablecord organizerCons:No extra bass if you like to have extra bassThe long cord some times is really nice and some time is cumbersome."
5,Review to HD 202,I got the HD 202 a month ago and I'm loving them. I was using skull candy earbuds before and these headphones make them look like crap.Pros:Amazing Sound In GeneralAmazing bassGreat FitFixable (If the speaker part falls off you can re attach it)Sweet Spot Comfort ( The comfort varies at times it hurts my ears but at a certain position it doesn't)PriceCons:Slight discomfort
3,"Provides great sound, but uncomfortable to wear","After going through 3 pairs of KOSS 20 dollar headphones, I decided to give these a shot. The sound from this unit is much more rich than I remember getting from the KOSS,but this pair has narrow ear cups,(oval-shaped compaired to the circular cups Im used to)that mash the sides of my normal-sized ears, and the frame is designed for kids or adults with small heads, as the unit is a tight fit for me...This is my first day with the unit, so if it breaks in any better, I will update accordingly, but at least for now they dont feel very comfortable."
4,Excellent Sound Reproduction,"Would have given 5 stars, except I know that there are others with bigger heads/ears than mine. The tone response is very good from bass to treble and in between. The fit is very nice for me, they are light and comfortable. I really didn't expect this quality at this price - I'm very pleased."
5,Extremely good budget headphones,"I got this pair of headphones for under $20. The quality is incredible for the price. The take up clip is useful too, letting you have the cord as long or as short as you want. This was my first pair of Sennheiser headphones and so far I am impressed with them."
5,Sound quality just wows me!!!!,Not much to say. Spend so much money on other low end headphones and it never gaved me that awesome sound experience. I saw this one on sale for cheap and figure since its a Sennheiser that I would give it a try. All I can saw is WOW out of the box and plugged in. The sound is amazing and clear. It does look a little fragile so I would be a little careful if you are out and about a lot. Also my head is small and these headphones I can tell will start to hurt after long periods of wear but other then that best money spent period!!!
2,not what i hoped,so i read some good reviews about these headphones so i figured id give them a try. i was pretty excited when they arrived and they reproduced sound fairly well....atleast the right side did. the left side was defective of something. adio would come in and out like a loose wire. needless to say i sent them back.
1,Absolute Garbage,DO NOT BUY. I bought these headphones and within 3 weeks the right ear went dead. They were a complete waste of money and I am sorry that I made the mistake of buying them.
4,worth the money,worth the money...good sound and rough handled. good ratings on amazon on this product. you can buy this if your budget is less than $30
3,Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones - No volume control too,"Head phones fit snug over the ears. Actually, the size adjustment allowed is not much. My head is small and I still find it a bit tight and it surely hurts the ears. (I have an old 10 dollar Logitech pair which fits better and does not hurt). I am disappointed with this headphone. It does not even have a volume control and it has to be done through the computer. Not worth the money. Better ones available.Would I recommend this pair and model to anybody?. NO. It is a pure waste of time and money. My Logitech pair does pretty good and fits nicely over the years. Can be adjusted too and is far better. Sounds good and in fact, the logitech pair is a headset headphone."
1,Bad service !!!!,It last only a few months.They don't pay for the shipping like others (Logitech).You have to pay 15 $ shipping for a 20$ item.Next time I will buy from a regular store where I can go and replaced on spot and another brand.
4,Good value,"I bought these to tide me over while I engage in a multi-house search for my Bose headphones. I didn't want to spend very much, but Bose spoiled me to the point that I didn't want tinny cheap sound. Are these headphones as good as my $150 Bose set? Absolutely not. But do they sound way more expensive than $20? Yep. I'm as happy as a person can be after losing a set of Bose headphones. Bass is good for this price range, and vocals sound particularly good. Sound is a bit muddy (lacks the really sharp definition I had on my Bose), but fine for casual listening."
2,Ok for price,"These will work ok as sound monitors coming off a board since I mainly record violin. It cannot do low bass very well, and there is a lot of crackling and distortion at the low frequency range. Definitely not for people who like boom music. They do not sound the best, but for twenty bucks, they will get by for now.These will be the last set I order without trying them on first. I do not have exceptionally large ears, but the padded cushion sits on part of my ear and after extended wearing it begins to hurt. I have had other sets that have a larger cup where your whole ear fits inside, and those do not have that issue.I do plan on upgrading but for now these will get by."
2,Too uncomfortable for me,"These were simply too uncomfortable to wear for anything more than 5 minutes. It felt as if my head was in a vise. Got the Grado SR80 instead, which is much more comfortable."
1,sound great -- while they work,"This is the second set I've bought. They have wonderful sound and a comfortable fit, but awful durability. Within a month or two each set had the one of the ear phones simply fail. No hard use, just simple failure."
2,Uncomfortable Headphones,These are uncomfortable -- too tight and the ears really are too small for normal adults (as others have said). I can't stand wearing them.
2,"Excellent buy ,while durability is in question","I bought this from Amazon one and half months ago... to be honest, it's amazing that I can get such a wonderful headphone under $30 bucks...i love using this every day on my train to work, until on the 31st day of purchase... left ear dies off.... exactly 1 day after the warranty!!!Kind of upset, but fortunately Amazon gave me a refund on this item and I appreciated very much.Overall, this is a great product , given the cost and sound quality delivered, but durability is really a question mark..."
1,Not durable,"Generally I review products months after I have bought it. That is because I believe it takes atleast a month or more for the initial enthusiasm and excitement to fade away. I have been a great Sennheiser fan. I own three headphones. All three are sennheiser. One is for sport and gym; the other is for travel and this is the one for home. I bought these headphones four months back. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about its sound quality. It is definitely worth the price or probably more. But the chord is too long and does not have a proper protection at the end where it connects the ear piece. This makes it too vulnerable to break and consequent disconnection.While my last home headphones (also sennheisser) lasted for a year and two months, this one lasted for four months. This is frustrating.This review would help people who are fussy about durable heaphones.I give 0.5 /5 for its durability.Thanks"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was in search of a comfortable headphone that I could wear for several hours, to shut out the noise of my office and allow me to listen to background music or even some educational materials while at my desk. The sound is fine, as is the isolation from the outside world (given that these are NOT sold as noise canceling headphones, they actually do a decent job of this). My problem is that like so many headphones they are heavy, and especially uncomfortable if you happen to wear glasses. If you don't wear glasses, or if you enjoy the sensation of having your glasses dig into the skin around your ears, then these headphones are a pretty decent deal. For those who don't fit the criteria I referred to, I'd keep looking."
5,Value for money,"If you are looking for a good quality headphone for around $30 USD, I recommend this model.Good audio, mini-DJ look, long wire/cord, authentic black colour, light-weight and comfortable.- A very happy customer."
5,very light and superb sound.,Seinnheiser HD 202 is a great pair of headphones with excellent sound mechanism. Highly recommended.
3,Not for moving around,"This is my second pair of the HD202. The sound quality is great for the price and the ear pieces are very comfortable for extended wear. I gave this 3 stars because the cord while more than long enough is very thin and breaks where it connects to the ear piece so you end up with sound only in one ear. My first pair lasted about 18 months, this pair only 6 days. If you intend to only sit in your room and not take them anywhere they are a value but I will look for something else to take to college."
5,Amazing at 5 times the price!,"I picked up a pair of the HD-202's and quite honestly I was skeptical about them being as good as the reviews rated them. I mean $18 and change for headphones? I have to say I am blown away at the amazing quality of sound from these phones. They have plenty of bass and the highs are crystal clear. I am still in disbelief that they were so inexpensive. I had a pair of $100 Sony headphones and these are actually better. I see most of the negative reviews are for durability. They got to the low price by using some lower quality parts here and there but sacrificed nothing on the sound quality. I am careful with my equipment so I feel they will hold up very well but the way I see it if they break in a year or two, I'll just get a new pair. It will take you a long time to get to the price of a comparable set of phones if you replace these every couple of years.Beleive the good reviews. These are well worth the money!"
2,Great Quality - however....,"with both my headphones and the one that my brother owns -the plug, in which you insert into the audio jackis flimsy and occasionally you lose audio quality in my right headphone.Have to fenagle with it a little bit to get it working, butdisappointing considering that the headphones are sennheiser."
5,Super Sound for the Money!,"Get these! You can't beat the sound you get out of these for the price. I've owned higher end headphones at triple the cost that didn't sound (or fit) as good. Senheiser makes quality, and these headphones are no exception."
4,"Great value for these headphones, overall a good deal","I just got these the other day and so far I'm very satisfied.the only reason I would give these headphones 4 stars instead of 5 is the bass does sound a little ""boomy"" as some other people have stated in their reviews.As far as the tightness of these, they fight perfect on my head and cause no pain or discomfort as others have said.Overall for 20 bucks you can't go wrong with these."
4,Excellent sound and efficient,I purchased these headphones so that I could listen without disturbing anyone else. I have the HD 600s and while the HD 202s aren't quite as nice as those they are extremely efficient so you get excellent volume straight from an iPod. The sound quality is also extremely good.Also of note is I have a large head (hat size of 8) and these are very comfortable to wear. With the closed back they isolate the sound to the listener and so suit my needs very well. I have also tried a pair of HD 280 Pros and recommend the HD 202s.
5,Great little headphones,These seem to be a great set of headphones for the money. I might have to get an extra set.
2,Too tight,"The 201s are fantastic, and I highly recommend them, but these are just too small. I seem to have a larger-than-average head, but still, caveat emptor. Both the bridge over my head and the earpieces are too small. I can wear these, but I'm in pain in a few minutes."
5,Awesome!,"Honestly, I was afraid of the reviews that said these are tight on your head because I have a big head and a lot of hair. These are very comfortable and I highly recommend them. The sound is clear and there is no static or buzzing. I have been sick of killing my ears with my MP3 players ear buds. Frankly, I have never had such comfort when using headphones until now. I like that these conform to your ears rather than trying to stick them inside. I wanted to use them for my meditation because I get easily distracted by noise (and pain). I love that the cord is long too. It will be a lot easier to manuever than having a short uneven bi-cord. I think that summer mowing will also be great with these because it will help to block out the sound when using the mower. I love the fact that you can hear the music without having to blast it your ears. I already have hearing loss from cranking up my music on headphones, so these also provide that as a benefit."
5,Mine have lasted at least four years now...,I haven't even had to replace the ear pads yet. I already know I'll be buying another pair when--if--they wear out.
2,Too much bass,"The ear cups on this model are not intended to fit over/around the ears, they're a little too small.The bass is over done. They don't have a bass boost switch or anything like that. They just blare the base and muddy the music at all times. If you like that sort of thing then this will be a bonus for you, but I regard it as a detriment."
5,Amazing Sound for the Price,"I became very frustrated in the attempt to find a pair of headphones that worked for me, and I have a drawer full of discarded headphones to prove it! In the ear types didn't fit right, and most over the ear sets let in too much outside sound. I was reluctant to get something as bulky as this set appeared to be, but figured it was worth one more try. After friends had recommended Sennheiser, I decided to try them myself. I didn't want to spend a lot since I had spent so much on other sets. Another review mentioned that this set is great for small head sizes, so the combination of listening to my friend's set, the low price and the fit persuaded me to try them. I am very happy that I did. The sound is fantastic and surprising at this price. The bass sounds are strong without being overpowering. The fit is great, and they are very light weight. They also cut out outside sound better than anything else I've tried."
3,For small ears,The ear pieces are very tight for me space wise. My ears are not abnormal in size but I have to put them over my ears carefully so that they won't hurt after awhile having some portions pinched by the ear pieces. They clamp pretty tight also. All else are great.
4,Nice Noise Isolating headphones for the price,"I purchased these mainly to avoiding bothing anyone when i wanted to listen to music on my PC or if Im playing a game either on my consoles or PC. They block out sound quite nicely. the sound is pretty good. My only complaints is that the bas is a little boomy, though it can be adjusted and after prolonged use you ears start to get sweaty form the isolation form, though it can be taken off, which is a nice feature. For 20 some odd dollars however you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal with this level of quality."
5,Great headphones for non-audiofiles,"I don't consider myself an audiofile, but I can still tell the difference between good and bad headphones. I don't like when speakers/headphones have strong bass, but make everything sound muddy. These headphones aren't very heavy on the bass, but the bass that it does put out is very clear and solid. I had a pair of Koss UR-20s that sounded terribly muddy after listening to the HD-202s."
2,"Sound nice, but...",These headphones really do sound great for the price. Unfortunately they hurt my ears. The phones are just way too narrow and I get discomfort from wearing them after 30 minutes or so.** UPDATE ** I would now give this item 4-stars. I've figured out a way to adjust the phones so that my ears do *not* hurt.
3,OK headphones,"If you really need headphones because you need headphones, then maybe you should get these. Otherwise, take more time to look around. You'll find something better for your ears. Actually, these aren't that bad, really. They don't crush your head or ears or anything like that. The fit is good and easily adjustable. However, when you use them, you'll have to increase the volume quite a bit before you can hear at the same sound level as another headphone that has a higher price tag and is a bettter quality. I don't know whether the increase in volume would hurt your ears or head. You can't hear it if it would, but you might get a headache and not be sure where it came from."
1,Do NOT buy them!,"I ordered them expecting nice juicy sound and what I got?I never heard more flat bass then they produced!It's horrible, they play very quite when I plug them in my phone, though all other headphones were loud and nice.I would say THERE IS NO BASS at all. DO NOT waste your money on this."
4,"Great value for the money, but audibly inferior to more expensive headphones","My primary reason for buying these was I need an inexpensive headphone for my kids to use on long trips for listening to music and watching movies. The earbuds don't fit in their ears very well, and the over-ear headphones help block out airplane noise a bit. They have performed perfectly well in the purpose for which I bought them. The one reason for giving these four stars is that I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 pro headphones, and the HD 280s are clearly superior in their sound quality. (There are a number of design features I like better, too, but I wouldn't expect those in a headphone at this price). The HD 202 is much more limited in both low and high frequency ranges, while the mid bass range sounds a bit too loud to my ears."
3,Good for the price,"The only downside is the comfort. The sound quality is excellent,the look and feel is very good. I have a large head (7 5/8), the headset squeezes my ears, which, judging from this, must be larger that most as well. The ear squeezing heats up my ears and causes them to sweat and I must remove the headset occasionally to dry my ears. If they were much more expensive I would have returned them. but for the price, they're are good."
2,Sound Good Comfort Bad,"I returned these headphones because they were uncomfortable to wear for even a short period of time.I bought another pair of Koss UR-40, because my first set were accidently broken.I was going to try another brand had heard Sennheiser were a good name, but wasn't happy with the fit over the ears or how tight they were on my head."
2,very uncomfortble,"I own this HD202 for year+, in term of built quality, I would say it's 4 stars, still functioning well, no failure yet. In term of performance, it's fairly good within the price range, i gives it 4 stars. However, the comfort level is way way low. It's very uncomfortable and hurt if using 30' straight."
2,Not comfortable,"I'm not an audiophile, but I will say these headphones seem fine sound-wise. I mostly use them when watching DVDs or listening to music late at night. However, I chose this particular model because a number of reviewers had commented that they were very comfortable. I beg to differ. I can barely wear them over 1 hour before my ears start to ache. The headband is not adjustable and the pads feel tight. If I can repackage them in their bubble packaging, I will be returning."
4,It's all I was hoping for,"I wanted headphones for my office to listen to my Zune and block out the ambient office noises and distractions. Aside from being a little tight in its grip, it works perfectly. I am more than satisfied."
2,Not so good or just OK?,"I bought the Sennheiser HD 202's at the same time as the Pioneer SE-M390's ... the Sennheiser's are comfortable, light weight, slim/sleek and seem decently durable; however, sound-wise, I don't care for them for my applicaiton ... they certainly have enhanced bass but it really isn't a good thing IMO ... the bass sounds ""processed"" and too heavy ... not a good sonic balance and not a pleasant listening experience for me ... I much prefer the balanced sonics of the Pioneer SE-M390's which are in the same ballpark price-wise ..."
2,right side quit,"comfortable, but the right side quit after one year. they just sit in the family room and used with the lap top so were not abused."
2,Go for the HD 201 Instead!,"I purchased the Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones after reading all the great reviews and because of the low price. Upon receiving the headphones I found them to be extremely tight on my head, with no option for adjustment. The earcups are a little small and barely fit over my ears. Keep in mind, my ears are fairly small and my head isn't huge. I gave myself a week to get accustomed to them only to realize that the left side of the headphones volume was considerably lower than the right sides. This coupled with the tightness of the headphones led to headaches and an overall horrible listening experience. i have since returned the HD 202's and got a pair of the HD 201's, which are not only cheaper, but incredibly more comfortable. They fit perfect, like a pair of headphones should. They also have a more balanced sound, while the HD 202's where extremely bass heavy.HD 201's all the way!!!"
4,Great for the price with one caveat,"I bought these as a last minute purchase before I got on a place and have loved them. It's a really good budget headphone. The sound is clear and it fits comfortably around the ear. The ear cups can even be detached to fit into a tight bag.The only problem is the cord. It is absurdly long. It comes with a little plastic dongle to wrap the cord around, but that was clearly an afterthought because the the cord does not stay wrapped in there and has a tendency to get tangled easily. Pulling one of these out of a bag feels like trying to unwrap a long string of christmas lights sometimes."
4,"Great for Video Camera, But Cord Too Long","I used this as with the Sony NX5 Flash drive camcorder. It has a great sound and feel as others have observed. The only problem is the cord. It is too long, too thin and the little plastic thing to roll it up on is clumsy and doesn't work very well.This forces me to spend too much time on shoots futzing around trying to roll up the cord. I will have to figure out some way to deal with the cord length either by cutting the cord and soldering the connector or find some other way to keep the cord from flying around."
5,Great Product for the Money!!!,I love these headphones sound quality is well beyond my expectations!Unbelievable price!!!I recently had a pair of $150 Bose headphones and had to throw them out after a year of moderate use.They fell apart and the left earphone broke.Sometimes you don't always get what you pay for!!!
3,Good while it lasted,"So I was very happy with my purchase initially. For the money, you can't beat the sound quality and comfort. So why only 3 stars? After regular use at the office, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, after approx 4 months of ownership, I noticed the left ear started to cut in and out at random. I realized I could shake or maneuver the cord and the sound would come in clear without going out.Sadly, as I write this, the left ear cup has completely gone out and won't play anymore. I assume the wiring came loose.So now I'm forced to toss these.I've gone ahead and purchased my first pair of noise cancellation headphones, the Audio Technica anc7's. Here's to hoping the build of those last longer than the 4 month lifespan of these."
3,Great sound. Poor Durability,"Agree with most of the comments here. Headphones have great, nuanced sound. Very comfortable for long use. And they block out ambient sound nicely. However, one of the cords has already frayed and I am now getting sound in only one ear. This has happened after only six months of use. Unacceptable design flaw. The headphones are now useless."
5,Sennheiser headphones,"These sufficiently block background sound while I am working. I do medical transcription at home and being distracted is not a good thing when you are working. I can still tell if the phone rings or what my kids are doing, but it does not overpower what my dictators are saying. Great product at a great price!"
3,Worth the Purcha$e!,"@ this price it's a good deal on Studio headphones. They are tight on me, but then again that's what you want in studio use (which is what I bought them for). Besides, I have big ears so they don't cover them in full which makes me wanna take them off after about 3 mins (they begin to hurt). But other than that. They're good. So if you have small ears and tightness tolerance, go for it!"
5,Good Quality and Value,"This was a replacement for the latest cheaper set worn out by my son, who has owned several similar headphones of different brands. These are comfortable, and the sound quality is good."
5,Excellent Product,"The Sennheiser HD 202 headphones are a real bargain! The sound quality is superb for listening to all kinds of music. I especially like the clarity and base response that you get from the Sennheiser 202s. The fitting of the headphone is slightly tight, but I expect that this will improve with usage. For the money you will not find a better headphone! I have purchased a second pair so that I will have one pair for home and one for the office. I have recently recommended these headphones to many friends."
5,Great Headphones!,"For the money, headphones cannot get any better than this. They are awesome, and I am usually a very picky person. I have nothing bad to say about this product. I highly recommend these to everyone. I have a huge head and do not experience any discomfort when wearing these for long periods of time."
4,"awesome headphones,","I was used to buying just regular philips headphones, cheap. However, these headphones are comfortably padded. Awesome bass, and they sound great. I highly recommend them, especially for the price. They are very comfy around the ear and the headphones adjust to your head. However, where the speakers connect to the rest of the headband, i can definitely see problems occurring. Also, the padding around the ear will probably wear down after extended wear due to sweating."
4,Good Head Phones,"I have been using these for about 2 weeks now, off an on. I have worn them several times - often for about 2 - 3 hours. They are comfortable - but not so much that you don't notice them. I appreciate the extra long cord with the cord wrapper. Its a good compromise between not having enough and having to much that ends up tangling around you feet. The sound quality is ok to my hard of hearing ears...so I wouldn't pretend to critique it. The plastic headband has padding wich I think helps to make them comfortable. For the price they are a good value..you won't feel like you over spent. The cord is lightweight about 22guage (similar to speaker wire). The connectors to head phones use lightweight reinforced - about 1/4 inch by 1/2inch long. The plug to the stereo is a mini plug."
5,"Great headphones, good price!","Sennheiser HD202I was overall very satisfied with this purchase. Sound quality is excellent, cans are comfortable, and the cord is plenty long. Highly recommended, especially when the price is soooo right."
4,Good Headphone; great sound!,"I bought these HD202 for my ipod, as I can't stand those little earplugs. I wanted something that fit over my ears and that had good sound.These fit the bill.And the price (less than $30) was perfect.If you are looking for inexpensive headphones with very good quality sound, these are the headphones for you.Many people have stated that the headphones are uncomfortable on the head, but they fit me just fine (and I have a 7.5 hat size). I was concerned, but the price was overwhelming the reason I went ahead with the purchase.So far, I am quite happy."
4,Great value headphones; good isolation for office use,"These are a great deal; sound quality is pretty good. They're a bit bass heavy, which I actually don't like but if you like rap or r&b;, these should be good for you.They also do a pretty good job of blocking out external noise. I bought these primarily for office use to try to cut down on noisy officemates who are often on the phone. Many people think active noise canceling headphones are the best at reducing noise in all situations; the fact is that they work best on planes and trains, but if you primarily want headphones to isolate you from chatty coworkers, closed-back headphones like these Sennheiser HD-202s or in-ear monitors do a better job at reducing that type of noise.To comment on those reviewers who said these aren't good for people with big heads... My hat size is 7 3/8"" so I think of myself as having a larger than average head. These headphones are fine if you have a similar head size as me."
5,Quality and value abound.................,I bought these headphone so I can practice on my keyboard without having to use an amplifier. The quality is great. Well worth the money paid.
5,Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones,I bought one of these for watching DVD's when I was unable to watch at a higher volume. The sound is great for the low price they fit very well and are comfortable to wear for extended time. They were so nice I bought more for my wife and to use while on my laptop.
2,Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones,"LASTED ABOUT 4 MONTHS, ONE SIDE OF THE HEAD SET STILL WORKS, FOR $25 I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE DURABILITY. WEIRD PLASTIC SLIDE ADJUSTMENT THAT WORKED VERY WELL FOR ME. I HAVE SINCE PURCHASED ALTERNATE HEAD PHONES."
4,Sennheiser 202 HD it's good but!,Well I think it's good for the sound I got it on Tigerdirect 2 or 3 weeks ago for 29.95 dollars but when I put it over my head for a long time it makes my ears hurt
4,Good Buy,"Sound is excellent. These headphones Squeeze the head too tightly and lack the adjustment to lighten the pressure. But, good value for the price."
3,sokay,"The headphones are not round and they do not comfortably cover the ears. They sit on top of the ears and hurt a bit. If they were made a bit larger so they went around the entire ear instead of being on the ear they'd be far better. They also fit too snugly and the big plastic piece that goes over the head cannot be bent so it is less snug. I am female and do not have big ears or a big head. soundwise they are good. Very good, but they hurt too much to keep on for more than an hour at a time."
5,Comfortable over piercings!,"I had not considered my daughter's various ear piercings when ordering these for Christmas, but she noted that they are quite comfortable, compared to the ones at her college which do bother her piercings. Although I suppose it depends on ear size and piercing postions, this positive seems important if one is to wear these headphones for any length of time :)"
5,Oh yea!,"Let's just say that when I left these headphones in my motorcycle and couldn't get to them for a week, I experienced withdrawals. These things are great, I love the long cord, the sound quality is EXCELLENT and the fit is very comfortable. Blocks out environmental noise very well. Great value for the money, and what's special about this model is how nice it sounds at middle-high volume levels. Clean, crisp, beautiful sound :)"
3,a little tight on your head,"I bought these headphones because i have sennheiser earbuds that i love.My kids use these most of the time and they like them alot,but for me they are a little too tight.I have a average size head,so if you have a big melon stay away.Sound quality is fine for the price,not great."
3,Not that good,"I purchased these headphones after my Sennheiser HD201s were broken. I wasn't as happy with these as with those 201s. The design is somewhat awkward and after wearing it for some time, my ears really turn sore. If you want some great quality headphones in this price range, go try the Sennheiser HD201s instead."
3,Can't use for long-hurts.,"I like to use headphones for travel--commute on lite rail or fly. These sound excellent, usual Senn quality, but the pads are just a little too thin to lift the innards of the cup off the ear, and the ""innards"" are hard--so after 30 minutes, ears are saying please reposition these headphones. After an hour, hard to tolerate for any more until after a rest. The sound is robust, I just wish the over-the-ear padding was too."
1,Pretty unimpressed,"I saw great reviews so I bought these but I was dissapointed. I found the headphones very annoying to wear for more than 30 minutes, haven't had the problem with any headphones before.The earphones on one side stopped working after two months of little use. I bought these in September and the return window expired in October so I am stuck with useless headphones but at-least it was cheap."
4,Great for its price,"I have owned a Grado SR60, SR80, Sennheiser HD497 and curently using Grado Sr325i. So having owned and heard some really good cans, I had a very little expectation for this $20 can, when my friend told me he has ordered one.First Impression: I was totally surprised when I heard it for the first time. It was much much better than what I was expecting for $20. I would say its a totally worthwhile can and unbetable for that price.Other models that could be considered are the Sennheiser PX100 and HD497, bot are better than this but are priced at $49 & $59 respectively. If you are really looking for a killer audiophile entry level headphone, there's still no competition for the Grado SR60.Conclusion: For $20, I seriously doubt you can get a can better than this one. The only drawback I found is a slight damped and constrained sound because of its sealed design. Nevertheless, its awesome for the price."
2,Pretty bad,"Presses against my ears and is really not comfortable, now i dont have a big head but i dont know if people with smaller heads would find it comfortable.Then it broke very easily as well but the sound is good."
2,Didn't hold up,"I was initially pleased with my purchase. The headphones are not of amazing quality, but considering the price I thought it was a good deal. About 7 months after purchase one side of the headphones stopped working. It's been 8 months since I purchased these headphones and now they don't work at all. Maybe, it's a case of you get what you pay for and I shouldn't expect them to work for very long. But, I thought they would at least last a year. Anyway, I'm disappointed with this product and I'm not sure I want to spend any more money to replace them."
2,Not a bargain.,"I purchased these headphones because of the good rating, but maybe I just got a lemon. After a few months, the left ear phone stopped working. I had to wiggle the cable to start it back up, until it finally got wiggled out and quit working. The cushions fit perfectly over my ears, but after all day usage it would start to feel uncomfortable. I used them mainly for music while studying, and everything seems fine until the above happened. Too bad it was too late to return. =(Hope you guys have a better experience."
2,"Good quality sound, poor durability","The earphones were very good while they lasted. The problem is durability which impacts big the overall value.I got them as a gift for Christmas 2010 from my son, I was very careful in the use and, still, after 5 months of regular -not heavy- use, I got no sound at all through the left earphone, which kills the whole product."
3,Stopped working in 6 months,"I bought these headphones in January 2011 for my daughter and she was very happy with them. One phone stopped working yesterday. I checked that the wires were still attached, thinking that maybe she pulled the cord too hard. They were just fine. The headphone has not been damaged in any way. It just stopped for no apparent reason. Yes I only paid $25. It is NOT a good value for the planet however to produce cheap items that don't last. I'll try to contact the manufacturer first. If that does not work, I will have to throw them away along with valuable metals used in them."
4,"nice for the money, a little heavy on the bass","I have several pairs of the Sennheiser HD201 that I really like so I thought I'd give these a try too. Whereas the 201s fit over the ear, the 202s fit on the ear. Phones that fit on the ear are less comfortable for me as they press my ears to my head and eventually they start to hurt. The sound quality of these cans is good but it's heavy on the bass. A lot of folks might like that, I don't. I prefer a more level response so I can adjust the EQ on my playback device. I think a lot of people would be happy with this purchase and you can't beat the price."
3,Not worth it for me,The sound quality is fine for an expensive headphone. But they are really uncomfortable after about 20 minutes. The long cord is a bit of a nuisance if you don't need it.
5,Fantastic.,"I've found that if it has Sennheiser on it, it is a good product. Great headphones. Sound quality is unsurpassed in the price range. Very comfortable to wear, should adjust to fit basically any head. Lightweight, but still feels sturdy. The cord is very long; a bit too long for me, really, but obviously that's better than too short.Overall, highly recommended. Not the cheapest headphones but well worth it if you like high quality audio."
3,Decent cans for cheap,"Moral of the story you get what you pay for. These would be a better value if they cost a few dollars more and one could get the free shipping.1. These cans keep background noise out fairly well. Example. When coworker asks a question I have no idea they are there until I feel the tap on the shoulder (while listening at medium-low volume).2. My friends have better cans, but they spent at least three times more.3. If your a soundphile dont buy these.4. Your coworkers wont hear what you are listening too.5. If you love sound buy billion dollar boise head phones or get open air models."
2,I am very dispointed,"I bought this model one years ago because of the company name and I had a ear-bud from this company sounds not bad. when I received it, It's quite big, when I try it, the volume is very low, and sounds quality equal with $5 one from discount store. since my first try it was sleep in my storage box. I do not recommend this one to anyone."
3,Great headphones!,"I like how when I sit on them, I can hear the bass right thru my butt, even with my pants on. I don't like how they broke right away. Great headphones, but make sure to sit gently!!!"
3,Too loud for the others in the room,"I bought these for my daughter to use with her ipod - as she hates the buds that come with ipods... she finds these comfortable, however, I find the music to be very loud with these headphones on - I don't know the official terms for it but the sound shouldn't be so loud for everyone else in the room."
4,CRAFTSMENSHIP HAS SOMETHING LEFT TO BE DESIRED 4 THEIR POPULARITY & PRICE,"I just purchased 2 pair of Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones for $20. a piece while the advertisement stated their actual price is at ""$40."" a pair...My logic is; Buy 1 get 1 free... Which I'm glad I went that way...They are made of plastic and seem a bit flimsy for the 'Actual Price' someone might pay due to the Great Reviews ....IMO...But I'm from the old days of quality crafted audio devices.I do LOVE the Sound; perhaps only a step below Bose??... And if someone knows a Better brand that doesn't cost an arm and a leg (Bose) Please let me know.I would recommend getting them while 'On Sale'The ten foot cord is completely worth it"
3,Pretty Good...For Under $20 Anyway...,"Sennheiser headphones, in general, focus more on detail, while Sony headphones are a bit more ""hot"" and have more bass and treble, but exagerate a bit.These are only $20. The sound on these doesn't live up to Sennheiser quality, and just almost sounds like a Sony pair. The bass is decent, but the mids and highs are really muddied down to me. These have a bit too much bass to the point of exaggeration so the mids and highs lack a lot.But they're comfortable, have a long cord, and are made really well. For under $20 they are pretty good, but for about $20 more you can step up to the next quality line. Get these unless you have a bit more to spend, then get some of the audiophile quality Senns. (like the HD497)"
3,Decent,Im not sure why everyone is so quick to give 5 stars for everything. they are pretty good. not amazing.Relax people.
2,Luke warm,Overall the sound quality is very good.The ear cushions are too small to fit over your ear and are uncomfortable to wear.The head band is marked with a L and a R but it is marked the wrong way to have the headband parallel to your head which makes me wonder which speaker is wired right and which is left. I mostly use these for watching movies and which side is which can make a big difference.All in all I'm going to buy a different headset in the near future.
2,Not happy with them,"Pretty good sound quality. I hear more things now in the sound , also I hear the static from my computer though which I dont think is a good thing.They are very uncomfortable to wear like allot of people have said. I wish I didnt get them. Im trying to stretch them so they are not so tight. In the mean time I am using my old pair that are duck taped together"
4,"great sound, but, yes, they do hurt after a while--overall great value","As the other reviews say, the headphones sound great, and they're relatively inexpensive, but they do hurt my ears after extended usage.I don't have a particularly large head. In fact, I've adjusted the earphones to a size much bigger than my skull, but they still pinch. The discomfort is aggravated all the more when I'm wearing glasses.Overall, though, I'm very happy with the purchase. I really can hear details in songs that I hadn't heard before. I've taken the headphones traveling--on shuttles, on airplanes, on railways--and they block out external sound like no earbuds I've ever owned could."
3,OK,"Sounds great but little uncomfortable to use, little tight on ears(though my face is elliptical) not to say for broadfaces...you can feel the ear getting lightly heated after half an hour...."
5,HD202's,"Sound quality is excellent no complaints here. Cord is of generous length. However head band tightening mechanism is not the best designed. It feels flimsy and under very rough handling can come apart (they can be reassembled). No folding design so they do take up lots of room in a bag. But for your average computer headphones, or stationary stero system, you cant go wrong with these. FYI, for DJ purposes you cant flip an earcup away for single sided monitoring."
1,Right Side failed after one week.,Don't be a fool like me. I read the reviews that the right side would fail but because they seems to be in a minority I figures I would take my chances. Big Mistake one week later the right ear piece stopped working now I am stuck with a 25 dollar piece of garbage.
2,pretty good,"My only issue with these headphones is that they are very tight. Even if you loosen the band they feel very constricting on the ears and uncomfortable.Otherwise, it comes with a very long cord and a belt-clip that you can wind the cord around, which is helpful for filming etc. Good sound quality i think-havent used them enough to find out.If they broke, i wouldnt buy them again"
1,"Cheap Quality, breaks after a couple months of use","I got this ~6 months ago and it was a great product until the right side completely gave out. There is no exuse for this especially when sennheiser wont cover it on their warranty. The build quality is appallingly bad, dont get this unless you want to listen to your music through one ear."
4,"Good sound, great price, hurts your years","These headphones don't hurt my ears when I'm wearing them, but when I take them off, after having worn them for over a half hour, I do get a sharp pain in my ears. The cups are very small, and would probaby fit a kid or a very petite woman(thus eliminating the only drawback to these phones.)I take off a star for the discomfort, but these are otherwise a good value."
3,Good sound - bad connection,"The sound on these headphones are pretty good - especially for the price. For that same price I expect far better jacks than the ones they provide. When I plug this into any computer I have to fiddle with it to even get the sound on both sides, and also to ensure that the static is gone - that's big minus!"
1,Doesn't hold up to wear,"Sure, the price is great and the sound is good, while they last! I've gone through two of these. One lasted 18 months, the next 6 months. In each case, the right side failed, I assume because of a bad connection. I don't mistreat them, they just don't wear well. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great Buy,"I bought these headphones a couple months ago to use with my mp3 player, and I've been very pleased. I wanted to buy a good pair of headphones and not spend a ton of money. I've used lots of Sennheiser equipment in the past, and I've always liked their products. The sound quality is very good, the only downside is that the mp3 player I have isn't great, so the sound could be better, but it has nothing to do with the headphones. If you're an average music fan and don't need the greatest pair of headphones ever invented, you'll be pleased with these. I was a DJ at a radio station for a while so I know what good sound is and what good equipment is, and these headphones are pretty good. Again though, if you're really looking for something with vastly superior sound quality, spend more money on a higher end product. Sennheiser makes nice stuff."
2,Uncomfortable!,"The sound is good enough to live up to Sennheiser expectations, but the ear pad sits on the soft cartilage of your ears, rather than your scull bone, so it is uncomfortable and too warm.I have a lighter Sennheiser at work that I wear all day without problems because it has a very gentle and light ear piece that rests on only the middle of the ear. When I come home and put on this heavy, uncomfortable set, I am always disappointed."
3,Aural pleasure not worth the physical pain,"Everything you've probably heard about Sennheiser sound quality is very much present in these HD202s, which reproduces music faithfully, in high quality, and with a boatload of bass. I imagine this is about as good as it gets for headphones that retail for under $40, and I can say with absolute certainty that these sound a lot cleaner and more satisfying than the equivalent Sony.Unfortunately, the oppressive tightness of the headband ruins it for me -- these squeeze my head to the point that I end up thinking about the discomfort as much as the music. Dealbreaker. A shame, since this model seems so ergonomically sound otherwise, with quality padding for the ears and under the headband, and a superlong 3-meter cord."
3,Excellet sound; painfully small cups,"The sound quality of these ear phones is superb! The workmanship is excellent; the quality is good.However, the cups are small(ish) and can cause series ear pain. After a few hours they can become unwearable from the pain that they cause from scrunching up your ears.I had to cut mine up to avoid the brunt of the discomfort."
5,Great work headphone.,"Sound is good, fit is good, isolation is good, good value. I use 'em at work where I don't care if they get broken/stolen/etc. and leave my expensive phones at home. I did manage to blow one of the speakers once, but Sennheiser warrantied them. Get some, they're a good backup/work/gaming headphone."
3,Decent pair of headphones.,"They're a little on the tight side and aren't adjustable, get a slight headache after wearing for too long. I'm sure they'll loosen up a bit after some more uses. The base seems a little on the loud side, which is exactly not what I was looking for, I can't stand dominating base. I probably wouldn't have paid that price for them if I had tested them in a store. But, they block out the other sounds around me, like my annoying older brother, so in my book, they're an all right pair of headphones."
4,Nice unit for the money,I bought these to replace an old set of Koss headphones that the plastic headband broke on. Over all they are a great set of headphones. They sound good and are very light. The only thing I miss if an in line volume adjustment like my old Koss phones had. I would recommend them if you are looking to get a set of good sounding phones and are on a tight budget.
3,Sound good but feel uncomfortable,"Like others' review, sound is good but feel uncomfortable after a short time due to small ear cup size even if you have small ear."
5,Great Deal,"These headphones are terrific - exactly met my needs - just plain listening to music. Two things you might or might not like. First, the cord is WICKED long! I have to wind it up. Second, if you have a large head, these might be too snug for me - but they fit me just fine. Definately recommend."
5,Sennheiser HD 202 is the real deal,This product is the first product I have bought online that has gone above and beyond my expectations. I use these headphones almost everyday. The quality of the bass is amazing and the long cord is a plus. It is very comfortable to wear and has the versatility to be used with an amp. The price of this item was a bargain and even S&H prices couldn't change that fact. The only negative thing I can say about the Sennheiser HD 202 is that their portability and design is lacking. This aren't headphones you can put in a purse or ordinary back without the possibility of it being damaged. But that is a very minor negative aspect if you look at everything else it has to offer. I was tired of cheap headphones so I did my homework and these are the best for the price. If you really want to hear EVERYTHING than the Sennheiser HD 202 is perfect for you.
2,Very Uncomfortable and Inaccurate Sound,"I am surprised by the high rating these headphones have received. I based my decision to buy these on the reviews. I don't know what shape heads you guys have but these cans just crushed the sides of my head. The fact that the cups don't fit completely around the ears did not help.Sound wise, there was almost no midrange at all. Instruments did not all come through the sound and while bass was fairly strong it was mainly thumping and not pleasant.I'm surprised Sennheiser would even want to tarnish their name with these inferior headphones. I most definitely recommend trying a different pair."
2,not the best,"I purchased this product because I wanted a headphone that didn't go inside my ears like the ones that come with most mp3 players. I have reason to believe that they cause hearing loss. Anyways, after reading several reviews on this product I decided to buy it and was happy to find them at such a bargain discount price. Now that I have them, I'm a bit dsappointed because the sound quality isn't as great as I expected and they're very cumbersome. I had a chance to listen to a friend's Bose headphone set not long ago (similar style but a bit smaller) and I was blown away by the difference in the sound quality as well as comfort of fit. This head set tends to feel uncomfortable after a short while, pressure that you can't adjust. I ofetn find myself digging out my $2 in-ear hheadphones that came with my ipod. Right now, I wish I would have saved that $20 I spent on this pair and put it towards a Bose headset, more expensive but well worth it in comparison."
5,Outstanding,"This is by far one of the best earphones in its category. It is very comfortable and the price is affordable, so the ratio price-quality should not be ignored by those looking for high performance and durability as well. I have lots of good earphones, but this is way beyond all of them together."
2,"You get what you pay for, better products out there",I have had this product for a little over two months and use it daily or every other day for my commute to work. The headphones become uncomfortable around my outer ears after 1-2 hours of use. After two months the covering for the wire where the wire connects to the earphones has peeled back and will probably snap within the next few weeks.
4,Great portability,"Even if this headphones are considered for home use , I've been wearing them everywhere for last 4 years. Thats how long they lasted for me. Best headphones you can get for this price!"
4,nice,"great depth and clarity, excellent isolation. for the $ i don't think you can get better cans. the only difference i noticed between these and the higher priced HD series is that you can't remove the cords from the phones.overall a good value."
4,Good headphones,"The headphones are good for its price.Pros - very good sound quality, really long chord, good noise isolation.Cons - quite uncomfortable if you have larger ears like I do. You have to sorta continuously find the optimum position over your ears to make sure they don't hurt/become numb after awhile.Overall a good buy for its price."
2,Twenty bucks worth. No more no less.,"They are light weight and can be worn for a while, but the audio quality is about what one should expect from low-budget headphones.The bass has an inacurate presence.They have a cheap feel to them and the foam will probably start flaking some day.Sennheiser has some great headphones, but these aren't one of those models."
4,Great headphone!,"Overall a very excellent headphone. My only gripe is the headphone is too tight on the ears.Great sound quality for the price! I also noticed some concerns regarding lack of bass, the bass is definitely adequate for me (that's only using normal bass setting)."
5,great headphones,"for the money, these head phones can't be beat.there great,long cord,out standing bass,go for it. you wont be sorry.what else can be said,there,sennheiser..."
3,Good Headphones for the Price,"These are good sound quality for the price, but they are a little frail, having broken after a fairly light tug of the cords coming out of the headphones. Cord is actually too long, too."
4,Very good headphone for the price!!,This headphone is really good sound quality for the price. Reasonably light. Fits right. Doesn't heart the ears. Lengthy chord. The only downside is the wire is very thin and it didn't last for an year.
3,You get what you pay for,"Sure, they have good sound quality for the price, but at the cost of other factors. Very uncomfortable after not especially long periods of time, don't stay on well if your head's moving, and one of the headphones failed after a little over a year."
2,These sound like crap,"These headphones are very comfy and feel nicely made, but they just don't sound good. They are very muffled and sound like they are in a box. I will be sending mine back soon..."
2,Trying to get something for nothing !!!,I think these headphones are a joke and happily I bought another pair for 150 that are good. I hate digital music and prefer vinyl. I have been an audiophile for 30 years. Digital music has no depth or warmth. The worse thing about these headphones is the comfort. They hurt and feel cheap. Do yourself a favor and spend at least 150 on a good pair of headphones. It helps the sound of digital.
2,They hurt you'r ears,"The sound quality is OK, but these things are extremely uncomfortable. My ears ache within 2 minutes of putting these on."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"When I bought these headphones, I chose to ignore all the negative reviews about the right side of the headphones. DO NOT buy these headphones, those reviews are correct. After just a few months, the right side of my headphone completely stopped working. I do not abuse my headphones nor use it that often, maybe once a week.Also, please think hard about comfort before buying these headphones, like many reviews have pointed out. THEY WILL HURT YOUR EARS just after 10 minutes. I'm asian and my head is not big at all, these headphones are REALLY TIGHT on your head and they will give you headache. My little brother experiences the same thing.The two years warranty is not that good, why? because I just checked out USPS today and it will cost $10 to ship with confirmation number. I tried USPS and they told me it will cost $16 to ship, almost the cost of the headphones. I live in california and the shipping is to Connecticut."
2,"Sound is not bad, but my ears hurt","This is my second Sennheiser and they both are not compatible with my ears. As all other reviewers have stated, the sound is good. After an hour of use, I need to take it off. Simply too much pressure. So I hardly use it."
4,Scimpy ear cups,"Great price, pretty good sound butdon't buy if you have big ears.Inside of cups measure 2.5"" x 1.5"""
3,Not the most comfortable,"Yikes! These headphones are definitely tight, enough so that I decided to return them. Not my choice for comfort, especially over long periods of time."
4,Lots of treble,The overal sound isnt bad but the high end is a little raspy and a little louder than the mid and bass. But for the price its great.
5,Finally,"Ordered the PX-200s -- great design, zero bass, even after break-in. Then ordered a pair of Sony earbuds -- flat sounds, worse than my Apple ipod standard issues. Then I ordered these. They were the cheapest of the three and by far the best. Very even sound, though I have to reduce the bass on my EQ for my taste. Though I'm sure there are better headphones out there, I can't imagine anybody being disappointed with these for the price. One cavet: These are not suitable for portable use and are bigger than they look in the photo."
5,Great headphones for the price,"Excellent headphones for the price. The sound is crisp and clear. I can hear the complex subtleties is many songs that were lost with my old headphones. These fit a little snug so if you have a BIG head, you will want a different style."
2,"Good sound, but ouch!","These are some really nice sounding headphones, especially for such a low price. Unfortunately, I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes because they *hurt*. A lot. I don't have a large head as some of the other people with similar problems noted; in fact, the average person's hat is about three or four sizes too big for me. Since I wear glasses, they're even worse. I've tried stretching these and bending the band to the point of worrying about breaking them, but they're still very tight, which means my duct-taped Koss headphones are going to be getting some more use after all."
3,good sound versus flattening ear lobe to head,"I am in an office where the desks are quite close to each other. Sound travels abundantly. I purchased these headphone in an effort to cut out ambient sound and keep in audio sound. These headphone definitely meet the task. The sound is quite good. I am hearing instrument I didn't even know were there. The thing is they really crush my ears. I am not aware of any over growth in this area. I imagine there are others with ears as big (and perhaps bigger!). This is truly subjective, but I will tell you that every day I have to weigh out the pain of the headphones versus filtering out the ambient office noise. This seams like an unreasonable daily dilemna. My advice would be to try on a headphone (closed one that is) before purchasing it."
3,"Good sound, but pretty uncomfortable","I bought these on the recommendation of the many reviewers who commented on their good sound quality. It is true that they reproduce sound well. However, as several other people have noted, they are quite tight and your ears get very hot after a while. I can't use them for more than about 30 mins. Because they enclose your ears, they also completely block out all external sound. This can either be good (if you are in a noisy environment) or bad (if your family or co-workers want to communicate with you). I recommend purchasing an open-air model."
5,Sennheiser HD202 headphones are super,"Love music, and really appreciate the Sennheiser HD202 headphones. They are very comfortable, the 10 foot cord isexcellent, the quality of sound is very good, and they blockout external sounds very well. I see why they are DJ headphones, they are just super. The only question I have is, how can Sennheiser sell such a great product for $23.99?Super product!"
4,Nice for home camcorder,"I purchased these for use with my home camcorder. They work very well, eliminating outside noise and delivering a very clean pickup."
4,Crying over nobody,"For this price, there's literally nothing better sound-wise by any manufacturer. The small cups with smash your ears and you won't be able to wear them for more than an hour or two. I lost my sense of identity in favor of the heartbeat of a false universe with these on my head. I recommend theSennheiser PX 100-II On Ear Miniheadphone (Black)if you can spring the extra $30. More comfortable, unsurpassed quality for anything under $400, wore them during a friend's wedding dissatisfied and sullen. Get em."
4,Great set for the money!,"Looked around for a good while for a pair of headphones I could use to start DJing. There are tons of headphones out there but it seems the ones that are always recommended are super expensive. I figured I'd give these a try at 35 bucks and I am super glad I did. The sound quality is great, crisp highs and lows. Comfort is pretty great too. The cup design wraps around your ear pretty well, and they're light enough that they don't get uncomfortable or make your head sweat too much after a long period of time. Only downside could be that the body of the headphones is made of a plastic that could be sturdier, but they definitely seem to be durable, and I've heard of this plastic getting bent in all sorts of directions and refusing to snap. Overall, great set of headphones for the budget audiophile, casual listener, or amateur DJ."
4,Well worth the money,"Great sound, increadible price,perfect fit. Who could ask for more, Having used ear buds for many years I've found that they really irritate my ears especially when I do yard work. I start to sweat and they become unbearible, Now with the 202s no problem. The bass response isnt as powerfull but it sounds allot more balanced. I also have small ears so the fit has not been a problem, so far. I tested them back to back with the Bose quiet comfort 2s, The sound quality was very close almost undetectable, So bottom line, why pay hundreds of dollars more? Do yourself and your pocketbook a favor, buy the 202s."
1,TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE !!!,"These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever used. I wanted a not too expensive pair for monitoring with my turntable/pre-amp setup with my computer. I consider myself an audiophile, but did not want expensive headphones for this purpose. With all the great reviews, I didn't even save the packaging. I will write a letter to Sennheiser. I get a headache wearing these. Totally uncomfortable. Would get 0 stars if I could rate them that low."
4,"Excellent Headphones, comfortable and keeps sound out!!","I bought these after searching Amazon for headphones that were good quality and decent price and I read the reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 Headphones and bought them. I've been using them for a good month now, everyday for a few hours a day. They are very comfortable for me even after extended wearing of it. My ears are relatively small though, so I could see how someone with big ears might have some discomfort because they may not cup over you ears completely. Also, these really keep out whatever sound is going on around you. I was impressed with that. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the audio quality isn't the best. Although I'm not an audiophile, so I don't know what to compare it to, but it has a ""closed"" sound to it. I had a pair of Sony street style headphones that had a more open sound to them. I may just have to get used it, and break them in more. I highly recommend them especially for the price!!!"
