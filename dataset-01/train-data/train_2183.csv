1,Avoid,"I got this when I bought my big easy infrared cooker/grill. Mine sits exposed on the deck and the cover has become brittle and shredded in less than a year. I'm getting a replacement cover now, but it won't be this one."
4,Its a cover for a grill plain and simple,All the negative reviews for a cover? For under $10 it does what it's supposed to do and thats keep your grill dry and clean.
4,The only one I can find that fits the Patio Caddie,"While a little on the thin side, this cover does the trick to keep the BBQ clean. Cover fits over the optional shelf/table that attaches to the Patio Caddie too"
4,Great cover for the price,"This is the third cover I've had for my grill, all of this same type, in the three-ish years that I've owned the grill. It does get abused, it sits out on a west-facing balcony on the 27th floor in Chicago. I have to keep it tucked under the grill all the way around--on my second cover I left a gap one time, the next storm that came through ripped it off and blew it to Michigan. That's why I bought this, my third one. The first one lasted over a year, which seems find for an inexpensive cover like this."
5,Really good,I'd never heard of these guys until I was wondering around the 'less than $4' section of Amazon's MP3 downloads. Prog-rock is something of an acquired taste but if you want a very good band to listen to that doesn't ever sound like they are making a song just to fill space then this is an album for you. And the producer was smart enough to mix the instruments at a level a bit lower than the vocals so you can actually hear the words without straining.
3,They've got something to put in you (sic),"Here's an album of personal and political activism and it was written especially for you...!Well, so the wildbunch would have you think. What youve basically got here is a 23-song romp of cod rock jams, a few covers and the fantastic 'Gay Bar'. Recorded at The Gold Dollar, Detroit and released as a 'live' album, the crowd are almost audibly non-existant which detracts from the quality slightly, but a must for anyone with a penchant for 80s punk/disco crossover and a sense of humour :)"
4,Good to use when teaching cursive young,I am teaching my 5yr old boy cursive. The wipe off format is perfect to allow a young learner to trace the samples. I am using with fine tipped dry erase markers purchased seperately that work well. This product is exactly what I was looking for. Paper and pencil worksheets may be better for an older learner that wants to keep their work but ideal for a younger beginner.
5,Best on the market,"This set will take you from a complete beginner to someone who can read, write and speak basic Italian. Well done and easy to follow. The cd set version has a lesson program that goes with the book and is very good, but short. I would recommend Living Language All Audio Italian. It follows the book also, but the lessons are complete and in depth. I have found that to be the best way to get the most from this book. I would highly recommend the Ultimate series to anyone wanting to learn a language. I have used many others and LL Ultimate is the best. If you want to learn Italian this is a great book to get you going. As always use the CD's to hear the language."
5,Great for Independent Learners,"This is a great course if you are seriously studying Italian on your own. It is very thorough and has all the grammar of a first year college level progam. The CD's and conversational Italian are intelligent and useful for travel, shopping and everyday situations. There are only 5 questions for each grammar principle. If you are a serious learner, you may need a grammar and verb workbook to complement this book for serious study. If you are just traveling to Italy or pick up principles fast you don't need anything else."
4,Good language review book,Good buy as used in very good condition. Needed it as a textbook for Italian class. A very good book.
5,It's Unbelievable!,"This vaccum is the best one I've ever had. I've had 2 other Hoovers and this is the best by far. My others I still use and the are good too, but I love this one for the fact that every time I use it I can empty the dirt and start fresh the next time. We have two dogs in the house that shed terribly and it amazes me to actually see what this vaccum picks up. It was worth every penny! My very 1st Hoover went to college with my daughter when I got a new self propelled one and I now use it in my basement and it still is running like a top. My other extra one is used at our vacation home in Wisconsin. The first vacuum I ever had was an Electrolux and I would never go back. Thanks Hoover for making such wonderful products!!"
1,Do not buy this,"At first, I really liked this vacuum. Then, after the first few months, it's started breaking constantly. Over the past three years, we've had it in the shop at least five times. Each time for something different."
2,Hoover ain't what it used to be,"We got this about a year ago, have used it some (alternating with a roomba, so not using the Hoover more than once a week or so), and it's showing itself to be a nice piece of garbage. The on/off switch doesn't always turn it off (which can be dangerous when the vacuum is eating something it shouldn't be), the brush on/off hasn't worked since the first month, the flap that allows the vacuum to switch between floor-rolling mode and hand-tool mode doesn't work right so sometimes clogs up the vacuum cleaner. When it's working it does a nice job, but there are so many things on it that just don't work right that it's always annoying to use.Couldn't they just spend the extra five dollars and make switches that actually WORK and last more than a few months? It sure gives the brand a bad name.Cheap, cheap, cheap parts and poor design which causes premature wear and tear.I don't think I""ll be buying a Hoover again."
1,Dirtiest vaccuum I have ever used!,"This vaccuum is not what you want if you prefer a clean house when your through. It vaccuums great, however when you go to empty it, dirt and dust bunnies go everywhere, there is no neat way to empty this thing, kind of defeats the purpose of vaccuuming!"
1,Bought 1 year ago - warrantee expired - so is cleaner,"After just over one year, this cleaner began just pushing around the debris rather than picking it up. Checking/cleaning all filters and dust bags didn't change anything. Checking all belts showed none non-functioning or defective.This is the second Hoover ""WindTunnel"" we've had in about 3 years and they've proved themselves to be far too expensive based on their lifetimes. If they'd last more than a year or two they might be ok, but this is rediculous!Look for something else; I know I'm am..."
2,Not What You Think,"After careful consideration I purchased the Wind Tunnel...At first it worked like a dream, although it was very heavy and quite loud but I decided that must be necessary. The fact that it has so many rollers is both good and bad in that the vacuum is unable to pick up larger items such as pennies. Because of this fact, I believed it would be impossible for me to ""brake"" the vaccum. You see you must first gather by hand all items that won't be picked up. After 3 months of bragging what a great vacuum it was one of the rollers quit turning. My husband took it apart and discovered the ends were attached with plastic which literally melted apart. ?????? What a stupid design flaw. I promptly took it back to COSTCO and bought a cheaper, quietier and better vacuum for...less."
1,Disappointed,"I bought my Hoover U6660-900 two years ago.It has been in the shop four times for repair.There is a valve at the bottom of the hose. When you turn the unit on, the valve is supposed to open when you pull the vacuum handle back to vacuum. The valve should close when the unit is upright. The valve is where the dirt goes from the beater brush to the main hose. When the valve doesn't open the dirt has nowhere to go but just a few inches then it plugs up.Needless to say I am terribly disappointed in Hoover.Beware of this machine.I don't want anyone to have to go thru the trouble of their Hoover Self Propelled bagless vacuum getting plugged up all the time."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HOOVER. IT SUCKS... LITERALLY,"This is the most disappointed that I have been with a product. It's been in the repair shop twice in one year for the same thing (bearings keep overheating and bind up). I've talked to Hoover Corporate and they say it's the way that I'm vacuuming. Yah, right! I went out and purchased a Dyson (GREAT PRODUCT... Highly recommend every Hoover owner to dump their Hoover and buy a Dyson)."
2,Beware of a Good Thing,"I've decided that the people who have given this vacuum more than 2 stars are the people who like me, bought it, tried it, loved it, then promptly went to the computer to brag about how great it is. Give them a couple of months and I promise you they will have changed their minds."
1,BAD VACUUM,Bought the vacuum on oct 1 2005. Brought it back to the store on Oct 7th. The belt broke! Thought it was a fluke. Tried one more...Brought it back after 10 days. A piece went flying after using the hose. the suction on the hose then did not work! Overall the cleaning was great.... while it worked.
3,Didn't realize how it works...,"I didn't realize that the way this works is to turn your dog into a four-legged fumigator. It's a strong mixture of garlic and vinegar, along with some other stuff, and after a couple of weeks, it gave my dog such bad gas that she not only got rid of the fleas, but also ran all the humans out of the house.Yes, the garlic is good for her, and lots of people find that it helps their pets, but be prepared. You may want to buy gas masks for the entire family."
4,Good Stuff,"Back for another order. Seems to work great on fleas. Have found a few ticks though, not sure the number it deterred, but they were imbedded. As for fleas, I couldn't be happier."
4,Works well.,"I use this in combination withshoo!TAG Flea and Tick Barrier Tag for Dogs, 2 Tags, and this year my dog has had hardly any scratching. I'm not sure whether its one or the other or both, but I'm continuing with both. Not to mention nematodes for the yard. Shop around for the best price on the Flea Free, though."
4,BECOME YOUR OWN SPIRITUAL MASTER IN MONTHS NOT YEARS,"I WISH MORE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE READ THIS PARTICULAR BOOK.IT IS ALL YOU NEED FOR COMPLETE SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION.BYPASS ALL THE NEW AGE RELIGIONS AND ACHIEVE A LEVEL OF AWARNESS YOU`VE ONLY DREAMED OF .. THE BREATH CONTROL TECHNIQUES HAVE SUPERIOR RESULTS AND CAN BE MASTERED IN NO TIME FLAT.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH ANYTHING ELSE.YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS WORK. IT IS CLEAR ,SIMPLE AND,VERY PRACTICAL !!!"
3,"Great Album(s), Terrible Liner Notes","I won't add to the other comments about how good the music is. It is; at least the first album and much of the second. Great stuff.However, if you're interested in this album for any reason other than the music, forget it. The liner notes are awful. Was there an editor during this process? I mean, the inclusion of paragraphs are pretty standard these days, aren't they? Run-on sentences aren't necessary either and generally tend to detract from the writing. They don't even do us the favor of letting us know which tracks appeared on ""Fantastic Expedition"" and which on ""Through the Night."" And there is little historical information other than loads of name-checking.Reading the liner notes in one sitting--which was pretty easy as they're only about three pages--left me dizzy and annoyed. If I had to do it all over again I would probably buy the two albums apart from each other. Really."
5,A Byrd in Bluegrass!,"If you love the original Byrds,[who doesn't?] you will enjoy Gene Clark and the Dillards laying down some awsome country/bluegrass/folky tunes.Not a bad tune on this CD,check it out!"
4,gene clark,"talented guy that never quite put it all together. Songs like Through the Morning, Through the Night are just first rate."
3,"Good seller, but the product wasn't amazing","I have been using Trojans for awhile and I have never had any problems with them. I then looked at a website that rated the best condoms of the year and I think this was #1 on the list. Eh, I really don't care for these. I got them because the list said they were incredible and I saw that they were cheap here. They were kind of like a tight fitting garbage bag. Didn't feel good to me. Maybe some people like the garbage bad feeling. I don't. It would get less stars but the seller shipped these out really quick which is something I like to rate as well. Will not buy this condom again though."
2,irritating for the girlfriend,"felt pretty good on my end, but my gf had an allergic reaction to the nonoxynol-9. if i understand correctly it's not used very often in condoms in the states because there is no evidence that condoms lubricated with N-9 are more effective in preventing pregnancy than condoms lubricated otherwise. wouldnt buy them again"
4,A Brilliant Slice of History,"Tchaikovsky: Ballet Masterpieces, starring Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes, along with the Sadler's Wells Ballet, show us Fonteyn's first amazing partnership in ballet, as well as the foundations of the future Royal Ballet. These excerpts are legendary historical artifacts, and it is so great that those interested in the history of ballet can now access these rare artifacts. Sleeping Beauty particularly appealed to me, especially with Fonteyn's elegance and grace, that was assessable without her having to lift her leg to 300. Of course, her technical proficiency wasn't as excellent as when it was with Nureyev, but it is still quite a sight to see. I recommend this to all fans of ballet, especially as a historical artifact."
5,easy to shop with amazon.com,easy to shop. delivery just 5 days after sending from usa in denmark.fast and effective
4,It does the job!,"Very pleased with the product - great battery life, only have had to recharge once in over a month! I would definately suggest this item =)"
5,Interesting take on Jonson,"Gave this to my brother, a blues man who is a big fan. He has all the recordings and a bio, so this seemed like a good gift to the Robert Johnson aficionado who has everything. He gave it a thumbs up, as did a bunch of fellow blues musicians."
2,ooops,I missed the part that this is a SCREENPLAY! Not a regular book. My mistake. I want more factual literature on Robert Johnson... not sure how factual this actually is.
5,"Great music, great lyrics, great everything","El Pus is now one of my favorite new bands. Every one of their songs are different, in stlye and rhythm, which is really important to me in music. I love the rap-rock thing theyre doing. Its sort of like N.E.R.D. but with alot more rock elements thrown in. In my opinion, El Pus is a lot better than N.E.R.D. Their record company even offered them a chance to work with the Neptunes but they turned it down because they said all of the netunes stuff sounded the same. This is a pioneering band. If you like punk, rap, or rock, pick this up. You won't regret it."
4,Atlanta produces another hot act,"I picked this CD up after reading it was part Hip Hop and part Rock. I must say I really like it. The lyrics are very good, and flow nicely. The music complements the lyrics wonderfully. Happy I bought it."
5,This CD is f***ing great!,"If you like rap and/or rock you need to listen to this CD. El Pus is so original in a time when so many people sound alike. Nothing out there compares. This is my favorite CD right now and I can't wait for more new music from El Pus. Plus, they are excellent live, if you get a chance go see them."
2,"good tiny little camera, but...","the size is awesome, I would give a 5 star. However, the IR, at night, is trash, you could not see anythbing, so it's not a night camera. I would give a 0, and the angle view of the lense, doesn't cover much, for a security camera, it's not worth it. For recreational purposes, I would say maybe. Not what I expected."
1,GAS!,"This product gave me terrible gas and bloating, even with only one pill. Could be because I have a sensitive stomach."
5,Life changing book!,"This is the book that made me a feminist. It boils down the issue into a simple, non-polemic subject. Are women human? If God gives you the gift to be a good mechanic, then, if you are a woman and women are human, a mechanic is what you must be."
4,"Thoughts on the ""Pant-Wearing"" Female","Short read- love the last page.What Sayers has to say was completely relevant and interesting for her time. I think she might be pleased with where we are now in America. However, I also think perhaps we have gone too far with the idea of the ""pant-wearing"" female. Females aren't men. They're female. To a certain extent, I think we've lost some of what makes men and women both special and unique in their sexes. We see some superficial attempts to reclaim this via television stations like ""Spike"" and ""Oxygen."" Also, the book ""The Red Tent"" has inspired women to go deeper and re-make connections with other women who have had unique womanly experiences...While I really appreciate the idea of vocation, I don't think it dissolves the (perhaps lesser) importance of gender.Nice pairing to read with this book: Poor Banished Children of Eve: Woman as Evil in the Hebrew Bible by Gale Yee."
3,"Uneven, but enjoyable...",This DVD can be sad and heartbreaking at times due to the content...i.e. the tragic deaths of Angels players and the choke jobs in October...But if you're a longtime and Angels fan it's great to see highlights of accomlishments and of course finally getting a World Series win...But it felt a bit uneven at times as it seems the DVD was going to start off chronolically but then it starts jumping around...Bonus footage is nice because of the player profiles but it would have been great to include some original broadcasts of importan moments like pennant clinchers and important at-bats...Overallgood but not great...
1,Welded blade breaks out of box,Vermont American not what it used to be. This is my 2nd VA blade. Neither lasted. This one has crack in bad weld out of box. Broke before getting to saw. Don't waste your money.
5,A Brahms biography based on his letters.,"""Johannes Brahms, Life and Letters"" is a new biography published by Oxford Univ. Press and is based on the composer's letters. The letters were selected and annotated by Styra Avins and its 550 complete letters which constitute the first such general collection of letters in English, were translated by Josef Eisinger and Styra Avins. The book also contains 48 rare photos, detailed notes and appendices (e.g. on Brahms and Clara Schumann), and a bibliography. The lively text joining the letters is based on the latest Brahms scholarship and provides a fresh view of the composer's life, much of it in his own words. It sheds new light on the early life of Brahms, his numerous friendships, his family, his work, his character and his personality. A well-written book which will heighten anyone's appreciation of the man and of his music. Highly recommended to lovers of biography and music."
5,A Captivating Look at Roman Britain and Germany,"In The Agricola, Cornelius Tacitus describes in masterful language the fantastically interesting life of his father-in-law, Agricola. As one of the most militarily successful governors of Roman held Britain, the account of Agricola is packed with fascinating descriptions of important Roman military victories. The battles fought and the characters involved ensure that the interest level stays at an elevated level. The Germania is almost equally as interesting in its description of the Germanic tribes encountered by the Romans. Their seemingly bizarre military and social traditions provide for a very engaging read. Although the Agricola and the Germania were the first historical works of Tacitus, they are in no way inferior in style or interest level to his later works. A definite must for history enthusiasts everywhere!"
5,Two Important Works Together,"I enjoyed this translation greatly. The translations are easy to read in Modern English, are not pedestrian, and keep the reader's attention as no doubt the author was hoping to do when he wrote the original in Latin.The first part, Agricola, is an account of Tacitus's father-in-law's life and political struggles. It shows the timeless tensions between great people and state powers, with a uniquely Roman outlook. I couldn't help thinking that this would make a great movie.the second part, Germania, is an account of the Germanic realms in the time of Tacitus. While some parts of Tacitus's account have been impeached in modern times, it still represents an extremely important work relating to Germanic studies. Furthermore, when combined with more recent developments in the study of orality, a new dimension to the work opens up.I would highly recommend this work."
3,"Nice, but not great","We recently checked this out from the library with extremely high expectations after reading Wildsmith's ""The Easter Story."" (That is a book a highly recommend.) It was disapointing. There are too many great Christmas stories out there- don't waste time on this one."
3,Good print quality but noisy,"The print is beautiful, but this is the nosiest laser printer I have ever owned and I have had two previously. Maybe defective. I am disappointed so far!"
1,Stick with the basic model,"I owned the basic Littermaid for 4 years and it worked perfect. It finally wore out and I thought I would buy the ""deluxe"" It has a weak motor. Is always hung up no matter the litter hight. you have to get your fingernails under the lip to insert the trap properly ""yuck"". I am buying the old reliable model again. The basic model is the best."
1,Don't Waste your Money!!!,"I had (I have since thrown it out) this litter box and while the concept is good, I spent more time scooping than if I had a conventional box. The waste sticks to the rake, it breaks up, and makes a bigger mess in the litter. I have since purchased the Manual Self Cleaning Box, in which you roll the box so the waste goes in a separate area, and then you pull out the waste receptacle and throw the waste away. So much better! Trust me!"
1,LITTERMAID WILL NOT STOP,LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Boxi HAVE HAD 3 OTHER LITTERMAID ALL WORKED BUT THIS ONE WOULD NOT STOP AFER THE CAT WAS IN IT . CALL SUPPIER FOLLOW RESENT DIRECTIONS NOW IT RUNS 6 TIMES AND BLINKS ALL TIME. HAVE NOT HAD A MONTH YET AND TRYING TO GET WARRANTY MET CRH
2,Very disappointing,"When I received the Littermate it did not work. I called Littermate customer service. Tech support tried to reconcile the problem, but could not. So, they did replace it, for $10 more and I had to send them a bunch of proof of purchase stuff. At any rate, they did send me a new one, but it is very finicky, it sometimes works, even with premium clumping litter, it works sporadically, For such a costly product, it is disappointing."
3,Great product for the right cat,"I had mine for 1.5 years before it totally died. I absolutely LOVED it the first year. I had one cat who always does her business in the middle of the box, so it was easy to maintain and clean. Then I got a kitten.This is not designed for 2 cats, a cat that likes to ""go"" near the sides or corners of the box, or shift around a lot of sand. My kitten liked to thoroughly cover her corner after using the box, and it would very often jam up the unit. Going in the corners can also cause the gears to get dirty very quickly, which causes the motor to work harder. Having two cats probably wore down the motor faster than it would have died otherwise.I am giving it 3 stars because it was an awesome product when it worked, and with the right cat. However, I think even with the right cat the motor isn't designed to work more than a couple years."
1,Do not purchase this product,"I have been a long time fan of the LitterMaid boxes but not anymore. Even though I have had to purchase a new box every year due to the old box wearing out (with only one cat), I have always been happy with it- until I purchased this model TWICE! I bought this 2 weeks ago and within one day of turning it on it decides to stop working right. The rake goes back and forth non-stop. My cat even urinated on the couch because he couldn't get in the box. I contacted the company who said it was because I had too much litter but that was not the case. The litter was an inch below the litter line and it hadn't been used yet.I returned it and purchased another one and the same thing happened. I did some research and found other complaints the same as mine. After this and on top of having to purchase a new one every year, I won't be buying another one."
4,Amazing,"First i wasn't shure this could work an my cat love it (me too) Right now i dont have my cat and bought a dog (Schnauzer), so i didn't want to throw away this litter tray. It takes me a few weeks and it works, So even if you have a puppy dog (small size) yo can give it a try.Be carefull with the amount of litter you use, never too much, never too little. Once you have experience it never get stuck"
5,Litter Maid,I have own these products since they first came out and I am very satisfied with the Litter Maid Litter pan
2,Motor problems,The motor died after only 1 month of use. Mfg. won't replace it; now I have to go through Amazon. com to get it replaced. This is a lot of hassle!!!!
1,"Three broke, I'm looking for something new","I had one of these for 2 years, it finally died a two months ago. I replaced it with this new model, the LM500...which promptly died after 3 weeks. Amazon replaced it quickly; the new one died in 3 days. Littermaid's customer service was a joke and even Amazon became non-responsive to repeated requests to resolve. I loved the old one, but at this point I might as well clean up myself. It's a fine idea, but obviously they're cheaply made."
1,"Don't buy from Amazon, you cant' return it when it breaks","So I get the litter box. After 6 weeks the thing breaks. It just cycles over and over again never stops. So of course the cat can't use it. Can I return it on Amazon since it has a warranty? Nope. It's way to difficult to get ahold of a person to process the return and Amazons policy is basically your SOL 30 days past the sale. I purshased a replacement from costco for lower price and with them, if it breaks, you have an actual store to return it too. So in summary, if the item your wishing to purshase has any chance of breaking ever.. consider getting it from someplace you can take it back to if it breaks."
3,"Works great, but cat is a little freaked.","I'm not sure exactly what happened. All of a sudden my nine year old cat started pooping all over the house. She has NEVER ""pottied"" outside of the litter box before. When we first purchased the litter maid, they seemed to get along fine. About a week later she's going all over the floor. Besides her mental issues, the product does exactly what it's supposed to. There's no smell. As long as you use a good clumping litter there is a clean box all of the time. This is a great product as long as your cat isn't too scared to use it."
1,save your money,"What a piece of junk! The first one I bought was broken right out of the box. It is as if Littermaid tried to design a product to expose you to as much used cat litter as possible. The rake almost always clumps up with wet clay and cat waste, so you have to manually pic the rake clean and scoop out the box. On the rare occasion the rake doesnt clog, some of the used litter misses the recepticle all together and is dumped on the floor. For the price of the recepticles, which you will need to change every few days, you could buy a silver plated cat box after a few months. When changing the recepticle, the edges often get caught on the tabs and it ""flicks"" used bits of litter right in your face! After two months of trying to make this product work, its going in the trash!"
1,good gimmick,"DON'T ..BUY THIS THING! CONSTANT HUMMING scares my siamese. it is supposed to be controled by break in light sensor but takes too long. cleaning rake is horrid to clean, tent is cheap. i have horse farm and mucking the stalls is easier and odor is non-existant but this litter box ,no matter what u use for litter, holds that cat waste smell."
1,Does not work!!!!,"Within two weeks of using this product the product started to malfunction and threw cat poop into the room. I contacted Littermaid and was given info to correct problem, but the problem just got worse and I have stopped using the box because I was tired of picking up pieces of poop as far as 3 feet away from the box."
2,so so,The automated litter box is really no different than any other liter box. While you dont have to scoop the litter the liter does get wet and clumps and sticks to the tray. The you have to clean the tray which is even more work then just scooping. I have to get gloves to clean it. Its nasty. The poop gets stuck in between the rakes and it gets messy underneath the liter box. They keep coming up with all these automatic litter boxes. One is always suppose to be better with the other but I know that every liter box has its flaw(s). To be honest Id rather go back to scooping. Does anybody agree?
2,This won't save you any work,"If you have a picky cat that will do his business elsewhere if you don't get to the litterbox immediately after it's used, this is the product for you.However, if you think this is going to save you any work, think again. Little crusties do indeed stick to the bottom of the pan because the automatic rake doesn't touch the bottom. It has to be continually scraped to clean it. Worse is the rake itself, which gets clogged with poop and cat litter. Really look at the picture and think how you would like to clean poop from between all those tines on the rake. The rake also pushes the sand everywhere into all those open nooks and crannies. It also falls down the thin line between receptacle and the unit. For this reason I myself would recommend the tent (unless you build one yourself) even though it is overpriced.Now that my unit has stopped working after 2 years,I am thankfully going back to the simplicity of a regular cat box that doesn't take me 30+ minutes to clean."
3,"** Not the Best, But ok **","I recvd this a few years ago as a Christmas present. I was so happy not to have to scoop kitty litter everyday, but this device is tricky. You have to be careful that you don't put too much litter in the tray or else the tongs will get stuck and constantly move back and forth to try and rake through the waste -- or if you put too little the cat waste becomes soggy and sticks to the tongs (yuck) which are not easily cleaned. Since the tongs are attached to the actual motorized part of this device you cannot submerge it in water to thoroughly clean it.I think this device is better for a 1 cat household. I have multiple cats (3) and probably will be purchasing the bigger litter maid box which supposedly is more powerful.Remember: 1 cat probably ok , but more than 1 and you might find trouble. Try the bigger / stronger Litter Maid box for multi cat households."
3,Disappointing,"I have two cats and purchased this product several years ago. I'd already tried other systems and hoped I'd found The Answer with LitterMaid. Sad to say, it hasn't worked as well as I'd hoped. If you can't plug the unit in and need to use batteries, you'll spend a small fortune on those alone. Even when using premium litter materials, I found the comb-arm was not always effective. Soiled material would stick to the comb and require frequent cleaning. I don't think the LitterMaid performs up to its pricetag. I went back to the old scoop method."
2,Not worth the money,"I hate this product. It's noisy when it goes off and can be heard all over the house! It even wakes us up at night! In addition, when it cleans the box, it dumps a small amount of litter out on the floor each time (the loose litter that surrounds the clumps and falls over the edge of the waste container in the process) so over the course of a short time, I end up with litter all over my floor.I am surprised to also say that without a cover (which can be bought separately but costs half the price of the box itself), the smell is much worse than my old, cheap litter box that had a cover with it.If I thought you could return a used litter box for credit, I would. I don't recommend spending this much money on this item--I had other people tell me they thought it was great before I bought but it's been anything but that for me."
2,Love it when it works,"I thought this was a great idea when I first saw it, so I went ahead and bought one.I got it home and put it all together and started it for the first time and it broke, the rake went to the front and stopped and would not move.So I took it back to the store and got another.That one worked for 8 months and now it is broken.It is still under warranty so I am sending for another.If this one breaks thats it I will find something else. It really is a great idea, when it is working it is pretty good. However, it is still messy to deal with."
2,"Good Idea, but Poor Execution","My wife and I received one of these as a gift and were initially very excited. The excitement, however, wore off when the cat stopped using the box and instead used the basement floor directly in front of the box. Our cat is somewhat large, so it is possible that he just felt too cramped or it is possible he was scared of the electric mechanism.Another problem we had is that the used litter and cat waste tends to get stuck to the plastic tines that scoop the litter as well as other parts of the box, including the floor of the pan. This despite the fact that we use a high quality scoopable litter (Tidy Cat) and is very disgusting and very hard to clean. We have now gone back to standard litter pans and still have occasional problems with him using the floor instead of the pan."
1,DOESN'T WORK,"when i got the littermaid i loved it for about 3 days. then it began clogging up and getting disgustingly dirty. NO ONE i've ever met, and i do animal rescue work, has ever kept this and used it beyond a month.want to get one that really works? go to http://litter-robot.com/ and check out the message board at http://www.litterbox-central.com this was a great resource for me. i was obsessed with finding a solution to the litterbox oder and time it took. litter robot has been a great product for me...for now nearly a year and on the litterbox central forum you can see testimonials from other users who are happy for longer. 3 weeks for this crummy littermaid or a 18mth warrenty and many happy users with the LITTER-ROBOT. littermaid is not the only solution. get a litter-robot and be happy :)"
1,"Absolutely horrible, noisy atrocity!!!!","Nothing good to say about this product at all except that the concept is good! The motor is completely undersized and exceptionally noisy. The rakes get packed with wet clumps of litter and the systems jams constantly. I went through 3 of them before I dug out the old ""manual"" litter box. The ""automatic"" ""self cleaning"" is a complete lie!!! As you end up cleaning the little maid more than a regular box. I would highly advise that you all save your money and actually pay attention to the other reviews as well. One star rating is one star too many for this god awful piece of litter!!!"
2,Manufactured to break,"You'd think that the makers of an automatic litter box would anticipate a cat's [...] to be of rather large size, and make a product capable of handling such. Unfortunately this is not the case. After a year of use, the motor assembly has broken and upon further inspection a small plastic piece was the culprit. Seems the entire assembly rests on two small plastic pieces that hang onto the frame. This is obviously a crucial part that is meant to break over time, just so the customer can purchase another. The motor is too flimsy and weak and should have been upgraded. Until they make something better I guess we are destined to endure its poor quality."
3,Littermaid Automatic Cat box,"This is the third box I have had and the first one seems to have been the best one overall. The second one, a step up from the original one I had, did not last even a year. This third one is once again like the first one I had due to the price was right. It at first didn't want to work very smoothly but I believe all of the problems have been worked out. You just need to remember to get the pan that holds the litter on straight on the bottom part of the machine so that the bar that comes across to take out the litter works properly. This really is a good product when working correctly and is a nice change from having to empty litter pans all of the time and trying to cover the smell. One thing, the carbon filled squares they send to help with the smell do not stick well on the inside of the cover and most of the time fall off before you are ready to empty the plastic containers."
3,"Can't live with it, can't live without....","I have owned 4 littermaid auto litter boxes. I find this model more reliable than the newer models. I have also tried 2 other automatic litter boxes both of which were actually worse than the littermaid. That being said, I still hate this litter box. It is messy, noisy, requires more manual scooping than it should and they die every 2-3 years. My cats have become such litter box snobs that when given a basic litter box then would rather poop on the floor than go in a mildy dirty box, so now I am stuck buying a new one of these every time they break."
2,Returned It,"I had to return this machine in just a few weeks, Amazon was terrific, I printed out the label and got my refund asap. However the product was not. The motor made too much noise and scared one of my cats, you can't clean it with water so how do you clean it?? The motor after a week got weaker and weaker then finally stopped working. Not meant to be.. I don't know about the other models I'm back to the old fashion box and I scope it myself. The few days that it did work however, I enjoyed the less smelly bathroom because of the fact the the waste was sealed in a little container it did keep the smell to a minimum.If anyone wants one I recomend another model do your homework. I should have listen to the prior reviews they were all right."
1,crap,I've had two littermaids in last ten years and really like it for very little maintainance. About a year ago second one went out. So I got LM680 from walmart and broke in a year. So I got this LM500 and lasted fot two weeks. Fortunately Littermaid will send me replacement soon. The quality is getting worse on these devices.
1,GARBAGE! GARBAGE! GARBAGE!!!!!,"UNBELIEVABLE! PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT JANUARY 17. RECEIVED JANUARY24. USED 6 DAYS-THATS RIGHT JUST 6 DAYS. I HAVE A VERY SMALLFEMALE CAT (YES, JUST ONE CAT). I NEVER, NEVER THOUGHTTHAT AFTER ONLY 6 DAYS THIS PIECE OF JUNK WOULD BE JUNK.I KEPT HEARING THE THINK RUNNING AND RUNNING. CHECKEDIN BASEMENT AND FOUND THAT IT WOULD NOT SHUT OFF. TRIEDUNPLUGGING AND TURNING OFF BUT NO LUCK. THEN FOUNDAFTER VERY LITTLE SEARCHING ON INTERNET, THAT NUMEROUSCOMPLAINTS ON THE SAME SITUATION WERE NOTED.I PURCHASED A 'USED' LITTERMAID OFF OF EBAY 3 YEARSAGO FOR MY DAUGHTERS LARGE MALE CAT. THAT LITTERMAIDIS STILL UP AND RUNNING BUT BUY ONE OF THE NEW MACHINESAND THEY ARE ABSOLUTE JUNK!!!!!DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER. READ BAD VERSUS GOODREVIEWS AND THAT WILL MAKE YOUR DECISION FOR YOUAS TO WHETHER TO BUY OR NOT. I SHOULD HAVE DONERESEARCH!!!"
1,OMG Don't waste your money!!,"This is the second one of these I have owned. The first one worked OK but the ""improvements"" have made this new one worthless. The rake becomes stuck and backs up almost everytime the cat uses it. I have tried every premium litter on the market and nothing helps. Littermaid also has thier own brand which costs about FIVE TIMES more than any other brand- it doesn't make any difference. When it does actually push the clumps into the recepticle it wastes huge amounts of litter- and throws litter all over! EVERY DAY I have to hand scoop and clean up the mess around the thing. What is the point of spending all that money??"
4,Works fairly well and we are satisfied,"Have had our LM500 for about 5 years with no major problems. Yes some cleanup exists with the rake but we have managed well without too much trouble and feel it has done a good job for us. We are in the process of purchasing our second unit. Kent Jobes - Shady Cove, OR"
2,LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box,"Some days this product is no better than a regular litter pan. On other days, it is worse. It ""scoops"" about 10 minutes after the cat leaves the box. This is not enough time for the clumping litter to completely dry - the result is that the waste is mashed around and not removed. We ended up turning it off and manually running it a couple times a day. This is better, but still requires hand scooping. Not much benefit in this - then it is much more messy than the covered box we were using before. I wasted my money."
5,You get your monies worth and then some,"By all means everybody has their own opinion. I kept saying...""it's just so expensive!"" However, if you think about it, by having a regular box (we had 2 min.) we were replacing the old boxes more often and it was a constant battle asking my husband to change it. Since I finally agreed to get this wonderful contraption, we have gotten our monies worth and then some and have purchased our second box for the upstairs too. With 3 cats using it, they are much happier as they have a clean box everytime they go to use it. Even if I goof and don't clean the liner soon enough they still don't mind climbing over it to use the box. I get a dirty look but not the pile on the floor. I am most definately pleased with our purchases and I am sure you will be too if you don't enjoy cleaning the box several times a day."
4,One cat owner,"I own one cat and she's not all there, so I thought this box would help. My roommate made me get it. I love the fact that I don't have to touch the litter. It's in my bedroom, so I turn it off at night since it has a very loud motor. A lot of time though the urine clumps get stuck in the rake and I have to get them out myself, so we are back to the old way of doing things. I know it's not the litter, because I tried two of the 4 they recommend. I can't find the Littermaid litter in the store, otherwise I would try it. I found to fix the urine problem, I turn it off until it has time to absorb into the litter and then turn it back, I haven't had a problem since. Nobody knows I have a cat since the odor control of this box is wonderful!!!! That's my favorite part about it. I love this litterbox, even though it's not perfect. I wouldn't go back to the old method of cleaning by hand. Hope this helps."
2,LitterMaid LM500,"We had used a LitterMaid automatic litter box for over 4 years without problem until it stopped operating. I ordered a replacement through Amazon and it arrived within two business days, as promised by Amazon. I set up the litter box, using the recommended premium cat litter and turned it on. After two days of operation the box won't quit cycling; the scoop just goes forth and back, forth and back without stopping unless the power is turned off or the brick unplugged from the wall. I made sure the sensors were clean but that didn't correct the problem, neither did turning the switch off and on several times.So next I tried looking on LitterMaid's website for help but found nothing for this problem. Then I called LitterMaid and waited and waited and waited on each level of their multi-level phone system. When I finally got to talk to a real person I was asked where I got the litter box; I said Amazon, and I was coldly directed to contact Amazon."
1,Breaks every 2-3 months. Only used by one cat.,"After 2-3 months of use by our cat, it broke (the rake mechanism won't move). So we sent a part back and the receipt as told by their service dept along with $10 and they sent a new one. Now about 3 months later that one is broken. So, I'm assuming we won't be able to get one again since we sent in the receipt the first time. Sometimes it got stuck and kept going back and forth because the rake got stuff stuck on it. I would recommend either buying a sturdier/more powerful box (maybe that would work) or a different brand. When it works it is awesome though."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you had asked me two years ago to rate this product, I would have given it 5 stars without a doubt. I bought a Littermaid Mega nine years ago and it worked flawlessly with 2 cats. One day last year, the motor gave out. Without hesitation I went out and spent another $90 on a new machine -- I got the LM500 because by now I had only 1 cat. Within 2 months, one of the wheels that guide the rake broke off. The company sent me a new one after I sent them $5 to cover the shipping. Four months later, a piece of the rake broke off. The company sent me a new one after I sent them $10 to cover the shipping. The third machine didn't work out of the box! For another $10, they would have sent me a new one but at this point I'm not wasting any more of my money. I don't know if they switched manufacturers or what but the current products are only cheap imitations of the original. It's a shame...Littermaids used to be great."
1,Newer Models Unreliable,"Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star, I would give it -5 if I could."
1,Not worth it!,"This litter box is suppose to be great and less work then a normal scooping box. But it turns out it is more work to keep this clean then an original. The rakes always get clogged with poop and you have to scrape them out alot. And it is hard to get the right amount of litter in the box, if the litter is just a little to full the rake will continously go back and forth untill you go and fix the problem. It is very annoying and could be ten times better made."
2,littermaid lm500,Kitty LoversLitter Maid LM5500 is a smart buy for custom cabinets that conceal kitty litter trays.
2,piece of cr@p.,"Oddly, looking on Amazons site, I couldnt even find a littermaid even available anymore to rate poorly.I bought a littermaid a long time ago and it was an excellent product. After about 5 years of use it died and I purchased another... The motor on it died fast. Since it was still under warranty, they sent me a new one after I shipped them the old power cord. That one just died as well and now im on the hunt for a new manufacturer. As pretty much most reviews for littermaid products, stay away unless you enjoy bad investments."
2,MOTOR DIES AFTER ONE YEAR,"I'VE OWNED 3 OF THESE - WE ARE A ONE CAT HOUSEHOLD - THEY ALL DIED AFTER ONE YEAR OF USE. THEY ARE VERY CONVENIENT HOWEVER, NOT A GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE. I CALLED THE LITTERMAID COMPANY & WAS LED TO BELIEVE I COULD GET A REPLACEMENT AT A LOWER PRICE BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED - THE ONE THEY OFFERED ME WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE ONE'S ON AMAZON OR AT WALMART! CRAZY!"
2,In need of product quality improvement,"When functioning properly, this is a great product, however and unfortunately, the Litter Maids have mechanical/electrical flaws. Over the past 4 to 5 years, I have bought several Litter Maids (have several Kitties) and five of the units have failed. Of the last two I purchased (within the last 4 weeks) one of these has already failed. The rake will not go into park...will not stop. Thus the unit is of no use. These units have been on the market for several years. Surely they could have made the necessary quality improvements by now. Don Johnson"
3,LITTERMAID LM500 AUTO LITTER BOX,"THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH SELLER. RECEIVED THE PRODUCT PROMPTLY AND IN GOOD CONDITION. THE MANUFACTURER, LITTER MAID, NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE OWNED 4 OR 5 LITTERMAID LITTER BOXES. WITH 3 AND 4 CATS THE LITTERBOXES ONLY LAST ABOUT 3 TO 5 YEARS. I HAD THIS BOX LESS THAN A WEEK AND THE RAKE SEPERATED FROM THE ITS FRAME. APPARENTLY, LITTERMAID IS MAKING THE MECHANISM SO YOU CAN SEPERATE THE RAKE FROM ITS FRAME IN ORDER TO CLEAN IT MORE EASILY, BUT NOT A GOOD IDEA. THE RAKE IS NOT AS STRONG AS USED TO BE EITHER.I REATTACHED THE RAKE BACK TO ITS FRAME WITH PLASTIC TIES AND IT IS WORKING FINE, BUT I AM GOING TO LOOK INTO OTHER BRANDS OF AUTOMATIC LITTER BOXES."
3,Once A Year,"When I decided to have another feline companion, it was conditional on having a self cleaning litter box.Three years later, and 2 Litter boxes later.... My Litter Mate Plus' life expectancy doesn't add up.The switch has gone out again."
2,Runs continuously,"I'm with the others who had the same problem with the unit running continuously and never shutting off. Kudos to the reviewer who mentioned the fix about placing a cupboard rubber stop below the toggle switch. Worked like a charm. Our unit worked ok for one day before it started running non-stop. When it works, it's wonderful. Hopefully it will last now.*Update:Well after a week of messing with the cupboard stops (still a good idea if I could get it to be consistent), I gave up and had to return it. It would work for a day, then would only go half way and stop at the receptacle or begin to run continuously again. My old one lasted 5 years. I'm disappointed with the newer models. Not made as well."
4,Litter Happy,"Product works very well. I purchased this litter box because of the reviews I had read, and also the fact that this is one of the litter boxes featured on LitterMaid's web site. At first I thought the box might be too small, but it is just fine. The LitterMaid brand of litter is corn litter. Corn litter works very well, but other brands of corn litter are half the price."
1,Not worth the money,"I used to be a proud owner of this and other littermaid products. I now however advise that no one buy littermaid products. I have purchase two of these units in the last year and both have failed for no reason. When I contact the company, I was talked down to and was not offered any real information about the source of the problem. This product is not worth >50$ for less than six months worth of use."
2,messy!!,"I bought 2 when I just got my kittens, they did work well for a couple of weeks maybe a month without a big issueVery noisy, a mess to change the containers, litter gets stuck all over the parts and the engine runs back and forth for hours!!Better than Purrforma"
1,Hard to Clean and Doesn't Stop Odors,"Litter gets stuck in the rake and along the sides. Cleaning it means taking the whole thing apart and then you can't immerse all the pieces in water as it has the motor attached.The litter is all scooped into a little plastic container which has these 2 ""bumps"" in the lid to attach it to the box. The very first things my cats did was scratch holes in the ""bumps"" as they didn't know what they were, this then lets the smell out.I put up with it for about a month and then went back to the old way."
3,Great machine until it stops working,I have owned at least 7 littermaid boxes ranging from the priciest to the less expensive ones ...its a great machine but the mechanism burns out easily i keep on buying them cause i travel for work a lot and i need it I wish littermaid would make a more powerful machine considering its pretty costly the newer model is even worst i find this model the 500 to last longer Good Luck to all
1,I'm scooping by hand again <sigh>,"My comments are about the LM700. I have one cat, male, and I'll grant you that he's messy.But this unit was a monumental disappointment. I found it to be a lot of work to keep working well. But I stuck with it, because I was enamored of the idea. But the list of shortcomings is a long one, the most endearing of which was flinging urine-laden clods of litter against the wall. That was when it was actually able to drag it out of the box. Much of the time, the motor wasn't strong enough to finish the job. It got stuck trying.Still... I'd have stuck with it. But the electric eye died after only about 3 months, so I had to run it manually. But that worked only I was right there when he did his job. Otherwise, the motor was not strong enough to move it once it turned to concrete.I finally had to throw the thing out. I'd love to see an improved solution, but I won't be buying another one of these."
1,broke w/in 3 days of use,I got this for my sister for christmas and with in 3 days the product stoped working. I was very upset because the animal using it was a 12 week old kitten with very little poop. I was out raged and immediatly returned the product and i still have not recieve my refund.
3,Happy at first...,I have been very happy with the LIttermate until the last few months. I had it for over two years. The litter is constantly getting stuck to the bottom of the box and poop is always stuck in the rakes. It's been more of a hassle than a convience. I'm getting another self cleaning litterbox but not the Littermaid.
1,Horrible,"Great in concept, awful execution. Disgusting to clean when the rake clogs up. There are MUCH better products- Litter Robot- well worth the additional cash."
2,Decent for a while but now leaks like crazy,"I bought this iron approximately 3 years ago. For a while, I was happy with it: it heated quickly, the water reservoir was easy to fill and it did a good job ironing. After a while, the steam function started acting up: sometimes there were loads of it coming out of the iron, sometimes I would have to press it on the garmet then hold it in a horizontal position for 10 seconds for the steam to give any sign of life. Finally, about a year ago it started to leak. I would have put up with it, except it leaked a black-brownish liquid which would not subsequetly wash off the clothes. It does not leak continuously, but it would leak at least 3-4 times during a 30 minutes ironing session. The black plate finish is very cheap - it came off after about 2 years of weekly use.I finally gave up on it last week and forked out some money for a Rowenta - the difference in quality is huge."
5,Jack Van Impe: The Worlds Foremost Prophecy Expert!,"This is for anyone who is really interested in prophecy. Of course, this was made many years ago, but Jack Van Impe is the Worlds Foremost Expert on Prophecy and has studied prophecy probably more than any other human being. This tape may be lacking in more recent history, but it is absolutely accurate in many, many very important points. I think it is a ""must see"" for anybody interested in what is going to happen within the next decade or so."
2,sucks,"this cd sucks so much. it's the worst casualties cd ever.it has two good songs and the rest are completely horrible and they all sound the same. and i'm not just saying that because they're becoming more known/sell-out and stuff. this is seriously one of the worst cd's i own and i bought it the day it came out because i am a big casualties fan and they were talking about this cd being one of their most hardcore and creative works.the only good things about this cd are that there are pretty okay lyrics, and finally we hear some backup vocals from the other members of the band, which was only heard in a couple songs in on the frontline.they need a new singer or something. and i agree with everyone who gives this cd a poor revie"
3,"Dell support, it aint","Great piece of hardware and the best screen of its class on the market. What sucks is Sony support. They were useless in help with upgrading to XP Pro. Don't even bother with their online chat and first line of support, they just want to know if laptop is plugged in. They don't know anything about drivers, install files, configuration, etc. Finally I had to do this myself without any help from Sony. Boy, do I miss the Dell support. I purchased this laptop to develop code. The resolution and clarity of the screen makes it ideal programming tool. I wish Dell had a laptop with a quality screen like this."
1,bull stuff!!!,"my grnpa hes bn raising ""beef creeters"" for a long time.. he is a honrble man and his dad was to. thy work hard to make mony and feed us and stuf, so why are you su down on them???????????he has a bunsh of acrekers and he trets them good so how coum you dont like him????"
4,So good so far,This is one of the things I got for my boyfriend for christmas. He tells me how much he loves it every time he uses it. It seems to be his favorite gift.
5,Love this mini chopper,I have had other small choppers where the motor is on the bottom and after several years the plastic that holds the blade breaks. This one has the motor on top. It's great for all the chopping for small batches where you don't want to pull out the big food processor...Easy to clean too.
5,"""Best little Food Chopper""","I had a good 2 cup chopper, however, it was just a little too small, especially when I would have a large crowd to fix for. I had bought a new 3 cup food chopper and it was horrible, so when I found this one I was so excited that it did exactly what my 2 cup chopper did, and it is a great investment.You won't be sorry you bought it.SMC from Georgia"
5,Does what it promises,"This chopper is well made and sturdy. It chops veggies even when they are lower in the container, but I do wish the top and bottom were attachable so when you stored it it wouldn't separate into two pieces. It does a great job of chopping uniformly too!"
2,Cheap material=disappointment!,After having this chopper 2 months the bowl cracked.....then the little piece the keeps the blade in tact kept popping out....very cheaply made.......would not recommend it!
1,Total Garbage-Just use a chef's knife.....................,"Broken bowl after 1 use. Stay away, the spindle in the bowl that holds the blade is broken, and cannot be repaired. Going into the trash right now! The price of purchase is not worth the remediation to get another. Website in the documentation is nothing but an extended warranty pitch! What was I thinking? Just use a chef's knife and be done with it. What a sucker I was! Total Cr_P!"
1,Piece of crap.,"First, the chopping blade spring flew out when I opened it up after using it. After I got the stupid thing back together, after 3 or 4 uses, the stupid bowl CRACKED. I was only marginally shocked, because even after reading all the good reviews, I had a feeling I'd be the one to get the crappy one. Grr."
1,B & D food Chopper,It really is more of a mincer than a chopper. It performed well if you like your food to be minced to tiny pieces.
2,Poor Design,"I bought a similar product to this about 18 years ago, when my daughter was a baby; I used it to make baby food. It worked splendidly! My family used that little food processor for way longer than we expected. However the plastic food canister finally cracked after 18 years of being put through a dishwasher, and I had to say good-bye. I replaced it with this Black and Decker Food Chopper, and after just a few months I got so fed up with design, that I just tossed it in the trash.My issue isn't with the way it chops food, that much it did well. The thing that I couldn't deal with was the clean up. The top of the food canister is also the bottom of the motor housing, and whatever it is you are processing gets all over and into these little crevasses. Since this is part of the motorized unit, it is not submersible, and this makes it very difficult to clean.Would not recommend this small appliance."
3,3 cup sizing is a little misleading.,"I think if you are planning to make one meal of baby food at a time, this may suffice, but if you plan on making larger amounts and freezing ....look for something bigger.The problem for us is that it can only chop/blend about one cup at a time. You can only fill it to the line (which you can just see on the right hand side in the picture) or just above the top blade, so if you want to make a batch for freezing you will need to do a minumum of 2 batches just to fill one ice cube tray.We also found that even though we never filled beyond the recommended line, foods still splash up all over the top which was very difficult to clean without getting wet."
2,"Alas, this one was a disappointment!","Took me a while to get around to writing this review. I use this machine sparingly for the fact that it does not chop evenly, forget fine chopping. Typical use includes chopping vegetables or nuts, sometimes fresh ginger. Te stainless steel blade was moderately sharp and the 150-watt motor could not chop dates!!! Finally, the shaft under the blade comes off, unbalancing the assembly which now won't work until correctly reassembled. As a result of all this, the machine sits at the back of the drawer. I wish I didn't buy this product."
2,Great...until it broke!,"I used this affordable little chopper several times and loved it. The last time I started to use it I noticed that the plastic housing that holds the blade in place was not just cracked, but broken in half! The pin will no longer stay firmly in the bowl. The work bowl is not available for replacement. My recommendation is to skip this item and go for the more expensive Cuisinart or KitchenAid choppers. It costs less in the long run."
4,Decent enough food processor.,"Doesn't work as great as I'd like, but it cleans easy enough, has some good torque to it, to cut through some hefty things, and isn't as loud as I expected."
5,Super mini processer,"Our old one of these finally bit the dust, but the motor is still in great shape, so I order another complete set, and now have an extra motor if needed."
4,Use it all the time.,I own this and the smaller B&D chopper and they are very handy. This one holds a little more liquid but can still be effective for mini jobs. It is easy to clean because the bowl and blades are removable. I needed a replacement bowl because of a crack soon after purchase. It was promptly replaced and everything has held up for the past year or so.
4,Perfect for me,It chops things that I hate too like Onions. lol I make alot of soups and dont really care about the size things get chopped too. Its small and compact. Its easy to use and clean. Easy to store since its small.
3,some pros and cons,"I bought this chopper because of the lid/storage option and think that's a good feature. However, the cutting blade is on a spring or something so sits about 1/4-1/2"" above the base of the cup. This necessitates holding down the blade (pressing on the top post)while trying to attach the lid when trying to chop small items (like nuts). It's awkward and seems to be a design defect. I've also used prior choppers to grind flax seeds and although this chopper has two speeds, it doesn't work at all on the flax seeds."
5,love it,"I've had this item for years. I only bought a new one because I cracked the bowl and, even though the motor is still strong and everything else is working properly, I was afraid the crack would hold contamination. I love this item and will buy another one 20 years from now."
1,Bad Design,"Darn - I wanted this product to be great, and it wasn't. The design of the blades is a problem. They are low in the container so only the bottom area of whatever you put in to chop gets chopped... actually minced. So you end of with almost liquid veggies (or whatever you're chopping) on the bottom and full-size, untouched pieces on the top. :o("
1,Broke after less than a year...,"Disappointed. I bought this because of the glowing reviews. But.... Purchased September 19, 2010. Cracks started to appear and finally broke on July 20, 2011, after getting used maybe twice a week. Maybe I just got a lemon? Well, regardless, I'm posting this based on my experience."
2,Eh. So so.,"Lid of chopper won't stay on. Does it's job - marginally. If ""chopped"" is what you want, keep looking. This thing PULVERIZES. :("
2,awful design,"I actually got this around 3 weeks back since I like to have the nuts crushed, but this item is not meant for nutsits got all the power and speed but the basic design for blade and the top cover is such that the small peanuts get trapped and then you might never get the thing working correctlyfor rest of cutting its good item, but I don't use it much"
1,Sucky food chopper,"I bought it due to 5 stars rating. It works as described but one thing makes me mad is ""do no imerse in water"" spec. If the thing's submerged in water, It will become trash because inside it is electronic circuitry. How do I suppose to clean over time if food sticking under lid or inside the core of the lid! It chops ...but in the long run you will eat germs and bacteria too. Stay away spend a bit more money for a ""cleannable"" food processor."
1,broken,"We used this chopper a few times to make pesto. The motor overheated, but we were able to fix it. Then the plastic container cracked at the pivot point and a piece of the plastic broke off. It is no longer usable. Very disappointing.Now what do I do? Throw the whole thing away?"
2,"Doesn't ""chop"", It minces.","This item shouldn't be called a food ""chopper"". I was looking for a product that would chop my veggies because I cook them often. Mincing them, as this product does, does me no good. However, it is good at mincing."
5,Awesome alternative to the huge food processor,"This little guy sits on my counter and is quickly becoming a tool that I use daily. Chops veggies in a blink, shreds cheese, whips eggs, etc. It cleans very easily and I love the removable plastic on the bottom so it doesn't slide around on the counter."
4,wish the bowl was sturdier,"This is a great little chopper, however, I found the bowl not to be as sturdy as I would like. It developed hairline cracks at the base within a few months. I have had it a year and will buy another. I just wish they made it with a glass bowl."
3,I think I should have stuck with my Cuisinart,"I bought this Food Chopper to replace an old Cuisinart that was starting to come apart at the blade. So far, I am not impressed. I attempted to make hummus and it kept freezing up. I guess the beans were just too thick. I tried to thin the beans out with olive oil, remove some, etc., and it still froze up and I did not have any more than the 3 cup limit in the food chopper.For the money, I should have stayed with another Cuisinart. My Cuisinart held up for about 8 years before the blade stem starting splitting. I may still order a Cuisinart and keep the Black & Decker for more liquid dishes."
1,Stopped working after using not more than 5 times,"Hi,I expected Black & Decker products to be sturdy and long lasting. However I had a bad experience with this product. The device stopped working after 5 uses in total. I am not sure what went bad but I am disappointed by the experience.I also just noticed that I am out of the return window that Amazon mentions, so could not even send this back.PS: After looking around carefully, there seems to be a small black switch on the underside of the top panel. In my case that switch looks faulty. I can make the motor run if I use a pen to press that switch, but it doesn't work in its own supplied Jar making the purchase useless now.Best,Ujjwal"
2,Lousy chopper,"I used this chopper for carrots and celery, and its good only if you want mush and a few chunks in your salad. It might be useful for home made soup or for someone that has trouble eating. Baby food comes to mind."
2,Worked for a Year,"I purchased this August 2011, for use grinding food for my father-in-law who has trouble swallowing. Worked perfectly, at first, but, after a year, the motor has stopped completely. I am highly disappointed, but I am giving Black&Decker another chance. I purchased their Ergo 3-cup chopper. I hope this one works better."
2,worked well but cracked too soon..,i had this machine for few months and the piece under the blade cracked. its basically disposable but works well .
2,Metal stick in the middle of the bowl got stuck inside the blade piece,"Everything works fine except, after 2 months (once a week use), the metal stick standing in the middle of the bowl got stuck inside the blade part when trying to take the pieces a part for cleaning, and couldn't get it out. I can still use the chopper, but now the blade part is flimsy when chopping."
3,"works ok, impossible to clean thoroughly","This was a decent little chopper, the blade is nice and sharp and the design is neat (different than the old food processor style), but it didn't do a very good job of moving the ingredients around in the bowl and the motor assembly part is a total pain to clean. I bought this chopper primarily for making sauces and purees, which are inherently very messy and made this chopper very frustrating. There are little words imprinted on the bottom of the motor assembly (the part where you hold & press the buttons) and bits of everything get in there, as well as inside the notch where the blade inserts. Since you can't wash that part in water I had to use a damp rag to wipe it and then a toothpick to get out all the little bits...not fun. I have since replaced it with aCuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Prep Plus Food Processor, Brushed Chromeand am much happier"
2,good chopper poor construction,"I purchased this item after reading all the great reviews. Most reviewers said it worked great and it does. It is far superior to many small choppers I have used in the past. It is a little awkward to load and foods like nuts and garlic can get lodged under the blade as they are loaded making it hard to attach the top lid, which houses the motor. While the chopper works great the bowl is cheaply made and the post that holds the blade started cracking after less than a dozen uses. The chopper is now useless and since Black and Decker does not really make the product (they sold the name) a replacement part has so far eluded me. I thought I was buying Black and Decker product, I now see that quality was for sale as well as their name. A shame. I can't recommend buying this cheaply made chopper if you intend to chop anything more than herbs."
2,Disappointed and returning mine,"I make lots of soups and got this to chop vegetables.I wanted something that will really chop vegetables into uniform sizes. This doesnt really ""chop"" vegetables though.For an onion it minced half of it and the other half was still in big chunks. So I had more of an onion paste with big unchopped onion chunks in it.It was the same result for celery.It didn't chop carrots at all, just had big cut marks in it. I had to still do those by hand.Also its a bit small. 1 big onion fills it up. Returning mine to get something bigger and more precise."
3,"Works well, while it works","I used this primarily to chop graham crackers, nilla wafers, and oreos fine enough to make pie crusts. It worked really well for about 4 months, then inexplicably died. I didn't use it for anything out of the ordinary, it just completely stopped working one day. Disappointing!"
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I love this chopper! It is exactly what I was looking for. I have made bread crumbs, chopped onions, celery and green peppers so far. Chops to a great consistance. Easy clean up. Totally recommend this procuct."
5,The Best Purchase I have Ever Made,"I recently purchased this food chopper. The reason I bought 2 more is because I already owned one for about 3 years. I wish I had this product so many years ago. It is the best appliance I have ever bought. The size is perfect, it is so easy to use,and clean up is so easy and fast. I make a lot of differnt recipies that require chopped onions,celery,peppers etc.It is so quick and easy to chop what ever you need to chop. I bought the extra choppers to give for gifts for special people. I would very highly recommend that everyone own one of these food choppers. I rate it 10+ My original one purchased 3 years ago is working like it was bought yesterday!"
2,Not too sure yet,I am not as happy with it as I could be. Sense I got this I saw what I really wanted on Amazon.com. I wish it was there when I ordered this one. Is it possible to send it back and buy the other one?
3,Okay for light use,"I was looking for a nut chopper to replace the one I used to own. My first chopper was manual and worked great for about a year. I thought I'd give this unit a try as it looked a little more heavy-duty. Well, it isn't. In fact, it is a fussy little unit. If you get even one nut stuck under the blade when you load the chopper you have to empty everything out and start all over. It is VERY easy to get a nut stuck under the blade because the blade pivots up and down (it can be locked into position by turning the spindle backward, but it still is easy to get stuff stuck). You also can't chop almonds or other hard nuts with it. I own a b&b and bake every single day. I need a unit that doesn't take so much TLC to get it to work. I will be buying another manual unit and sticking this one aside until I find some other less annoying-making use for it."
4,Tiny but powerful at an economic price,"This is great for chopping vegetables or grinding nuts, etc. It shortened my cooking time to less than half the time to prepare ingredients in advance. I was able to make many dishes using the food chopper from vegetable dishes to muffins. Great addition to a space conscious kitchen at an economic price."
4,Great for little jobs,"We've made several rounds of salsa using this little chopper. It works like a charm for veggies and fruit. I put some cooked chicken chunks in it the other day to chop up for quesadillas, and it wouldn't even budge. I guess that was too tough a job for it. Other than that incident I've been very pleased with it. It also cleans up easily."
4,One of my favorite things in a kitchen,"This is a second time I bought EHC650 Ergo 3-Cup Food Chopper.I used first one at least twice a week for 2 years and loved it.I gave it four stars because there was a problemwith a plastic bowl.First, hairline cracks appeared on a bottom, then cracks become deeper and wider, and then, stem on the bottom of the bowl was disconnected from the bowl and stuck (forever) inside lower plastic portion of the blade.Since becoming so addicted to using that chopper, I had to buy another one.I hope it will last at least as long as my old one.It worth the money because it really does a good job, convenient to use, looks very cute.I wish Black&Decker; would make some improvements to it."
1,breeding ground for germs,"I read all these reviews and decided to buy this chopper.I have absolutely no complaints about performance.It chops and purees most things.I also like the way it handles. It is very comfortable and simple to use.Why the low rating?quite frankly, it is a complete nightmare to clean.Tiny bits of food will get stuck in the plastic holding the blade.Food will also get stuck in little crevices in the top part (which you cannot submerge in water).I just let the blade soak. I also picked out all the particles with a toothpick. Then I would wash it in hot water and soap. I would let the unit dry completely before putting it back together and storing it in my cupboard.But that didn't stop the black mold from growing!!!This is such a shame because I really liked using this product."
2,I have teeth and I don't want to drink onions through a straw,"This machine makes everything into a drink. It chops everything way too fine. We tried chopping an onion by ""pulsing on LO"" and basically we came out with big chunks on top and onion milk on the bottom. This thing seems to be good for salsa and applesauce. I gave it 2 stars because I really expected to have a coarse chop and that was a no go. Plus the instructions tell you to cut your onions into 6 pieces.... umm... hello? That's what I bought this thing for..."
3,worked good for 2 months only!,I bought this on july 20th and it worked great for two monthsnow it is not working any more !
2,"Weak, doesn't chop nuts","We bought this based on the ratings here, but when it arrived, it failed on the first thing we gave it: roasted almonds. The blade (at least on ours) starts very slowly and takes a couple of seconds to get up to speed. Thus almonds (only 1/4 cup, shelled of course) were bulky enough to make sure that the blade never got up to an adequate speed to chop them. This despite the instructions saying how to chop nuts with it. I don't know if it was defective or not; we returned it before trying anything else."
5,great chopper,bought it as a gift for my sis. she loved it! cut her cooking time in half!! so far so good.
2,DESIGN FLAW,"Yes it chops well, but the design is flawed - the underside of the top part needs washing after use. So first it has to be unplugged (a drag) to rinse it under the tap, but it's not waterproof on the underside.I prefer the motorized part to be on the bottom, so that part stays on the counter and you don't need to unplug it.The upside: I guess it's more of a ""green"" product, as it forces you to unplug it hence negating any ""vampire"" electricity effect."
3,Not what i was expecting,"I think this would be better for purees. the bottom half the the food gets beat to a pulp and the top stays chunky. I bought one of those manual slap chop (not actually ""the"" slap chop) things and i like it better. easier to clean than this thing too.I dont know whos writing all these rave reviews, which is what made me buy this thing, but for me it aint worth it."
3,Not ideal for Smoothies,"Length:: 0:31 MinsI realize that this doesn't claim to be a smoothie maker, but we purchased it for making smoothies after reading in the comment section that it functioned well for that purpose. We were hoping that it would create a smooth ""smoothie"". It's a fantastic price, but it didn't puree as well as our three-cup Hamilton Beach mini blender ($12 on Amazon). If you're looking for a mini processor this is great, but it's not ideal for making a smoothie unless you don't mind lots of pulp! See video review..."
4,I use it everyday,"I use this chopper almost every day. I have a small family, 2 adults and 1 baby. I use this to mince/chop onions, tomatoes, cheese. Even nuts. The bowl cleans easily. The one downside is that the top (lid) has the actual grinding machine and you cannot ""wash"" it or immerse it in water, it needs to be wiped clean."
3,smaller than I needed,"I had a lot of green tomatoes to chop and my really old food processor wasn't equal to the job. I hoped this would do the job, but it's evidently designed for small jobs. I should have gotten a manual food grinder for what I was doing. I use it now to make small batches of salsa or to chop onions and mushrooms for scrambled eggs."
3,Good quality product with minor issue,"Quality is great and it works perfectly. Only problem is that it doesn't have a lid for the jar that can act as a barrier between the food items getting chopped and the part in which motor is fixed. We have to wash the bulky part which has the motor and it runs the risk of motor getting wet and cant be washed in dishwasher. Whenever we chop tomatoes, the motor container needs to be washed carefully and dried before next use. It would have been convenient to have an extra lid/plate to make it perfect."
3,broke quickly,"i LOVE this chopper. I had the same one for a couple of years, but ordered a new one after wear and tear. The new one was the same, but broke in two places within the first couple weeks of use. There is a crack in the bottom and the metal piece that holds the blade broke out as well. Still works. Still use it. Wish it were a little more durable."
3,Poorly made,"This thing worked great for the first couple months we owned it. We have not used it a lot, I'd say maybe 2-3 times per month. Now the high speed button does not work, only the low speed. The low speed does a good job but I am wondering when it too will no longer work and this appliance will add to the landfill."
1,Broke after 2 uses,"I bought this based on its positive reviews. Although I agree that it did work great, mine broke after 2 uses. I am currently in the process of returning it (as it has a 2 year warranty)."
2,"Bowl cracked in first month, quit working within 2 years","I have to agree with others that this thing did a fine job for such a small unit. However, the bowl cracked within the first month of use. When liquids finally started to leak from the crack, I bought a replacement bowl. Unfortunately, I only got to use the 2nd bowl twice because the darn motor stopped working! It's also very unsanitary given that you cannot fully clean the top part which contains the motor & power cord. Try making a spicy peanut salad dressing & then be limited to using only a damp cloth to clean it—gross."
1,Broke after the first use! Do NOT buy this chopper.,"I used this chopper for the first time to make some simple Chocolate Hazelnut butter. I chopped up the Hazelnuts and added a few other ingredients, and within 3 minutes of using it, the motor broke! Will be attempting to deal with the company to get my money back, what a RIP OFF!! I realize this was only 15 dollars, but it shouldn't break after using it for 3 minutes!!!"
2,OK,"Works ok but it doesn't really chop. I have tried it with a few things and it seems to shred more than chop. Much better suited for hard or dry stuff, like nuts or mushrooms. When I want something softer (onions, green peppers) diced, I still have to use a knife. Disappointing."
3,"Fantastic Processor, with top lid issues","I love this food processor - its blades are really powerful and no matter how much I stuff into the container, everything gets chopped fantastically.The only thing I don't like is that there is no way to wash the top part of the device, as it is electric and has the plug and wire. I'm not sure if this is so sanitary, especially when chopping meat. Bits of the plastic surrounding the screws on the top lid have fallen out (hopefully not into my food...), and chunks of food occasionally get caught in the cracks. It's annoying, and it would be so much better if the top had a snap-off lid that one could wash.Also, be careful when using this chopper for seafood - the smell sticks to the plastic container, and requires a good scrubbing."
2,Hard to clean and not sturdy,Before purchasing this chopper I owned a Black and Decker chopper that I loved (it lasted about 10 years) and so I wanted to stick with the Black and Decker brand. I've now had this model for about 6 months and this morning the container cracked where the blade spins. Even before this breakage I was not thrilled with this model. The top of the chopper gets quite messy and since this is where the motor it's difficult to clean properly.
1,I must not be destined to own this product.,"I bought this chopper about 6 months ago. I found a lot of use for it and I liked the size. I used it about 3 times a week until it quit working after 4 months. When I pressed the buttons, nothing happened. Well I got used to having a chopper so I signed onto Amazon and ordered another one. (I considered buying a non-electric one and wish I had.) UPS left the box on my door and it got stolen. I ordered ANOTHER B&D; chopper. This one did not get stolen. Yah!!! It worked for 3 nights and that one broke too. Same thing. I press the buttons, nothing.I'm glad it worked out for most of you. It seems to be a decent product. Granted the one that got stolen was not B&D;'s fault but the 2 that I did have did not last very long at all. So after 3 choppers with shipping I'm out about $75-$80 and have no working chopper. Grrrr!!!"
1,never again. Save your money,This chopper broke after 3rd time use. It started smelling like burned plastic. I turned it off right away. I tried later again and it stopped working.I sent it back and they sent me a replacement instead of an refund... So now i still try to get my money back. Because i'm not using this chopper again.I don't feel safe using it. Save your money. That item has an issue that is not solved yet
2,"Dies a quick, painful death","For 3 months, the chopper was great. It chopped the food well enough so I could swallow without choking. Food would occasionally get stuck underneath the blade, but we would move it around and the chopper resumed chopping. Then, without warning, it stopped working after 3 months. When we called the manufacturer to help troubleshoot, they said it must be the power source. We checked the outlet, and it was working fine. Then, the manufacturer suggested that we were using the chopper too much. The representative said, ""it's not meant for everyday use."" Um, really? Nice to know that the product fails after 3 months and the manufacturer was quick to blame the user for actually USING it. Huh. Perhaps they should spend more time creating a product that doesn't break after 3 months."
3,Handy to have,"Very handy product to have on hand, simple to use and easy to clean. However, since the motor is in the top portion of the chopper and you cannot run it under water to clean, it is a good idea to use plastic wrap. Just take a piece of plastic wrap and place it on the top of the chopper bowl, put a small hole in the middle and put the motor on the bowl. You only have to toss the plastic wrap when done, and put the bowl and blade in the dishwasher."
5,Wow!,This little gadget works great! Best bang for the buck for sure.... It has good power for a little processor and cleans up nicely.
2,excellent chopper while it worked,bought this chopper a few months ago worked great but burnt out already. the bowl started to crack about a month ago and the motor quit last week
3,You get what you pay for...,"The blade spindle and the cup are very fragile. After two uses the cup cracked (was still able to hold liquid) and on the third use the spindle came out of the cup. The only thing this processor has been used for is to chop onions and garlic. As of right now it still works, but if I could go back I would spend some more money on a better quality unit."
5,I love this ergo food chopper,"I have had my Ergo for about 10 years. We bought it initially to use in our little trailer, but I never found the need to buy a larger one. It was just the right size for the two of us to make almost anything we needed to make in it. After having to grind things fine in a hand-turned meat grinder I found this a real time and work saver whether grinding up onions and cellery and other things for a meat loaf or making a broccoli or carrot salad, the grind was just right."
5,The best chopper ever!,I have purchased several choppers in the past and none stack up to this one. It chops from top to bottom so you don't have to stir your food inside. I will only use this chopper!
5,Easy to use,"I was looking for something a little bigger than my baby food processor to help me chop up my toddler's food a little bit. I didn't want something too loud because he is the type that hates the vacuum sound. I figured 3 cups was not too huge and not as small as our baby food processor. I purchased it for 14.99 plus tax and absolutely love it. You cannot beat this especially for the price. It is so easy to clean and it is NOT loud at all. It's quieter than our baby food processor. I'm just hoping this plastic bowl never breaks like i've read in the previous reviews. I guess that's why the cashier was offering me a replacement plan for a fee at checkout. Reading the insert, i believe this has a one year warranty. The major bonus is the lid that can be attached to the bottom for a slip free base or can be put on top of the bowl for you to store it in the fridge..how cool is that?"
5,It really does a good job.,"This is one of the best little choppers put on the market. We use ours several times a week. It does a wonderful job on carrots, onions and etc. to decorate a salad. I have had many compliments on them. The only thing I find wrong is you have to be careful of the top falling off when picking it up. We ended up buying them for our children."
1,Crappy food chopper,"I bought this 2 weeks ago and it worked ok, nothing special, it got thrown in the trash today cause when i was soaking the plastic bowl i tossed in the blade well it got stuck and with no luck i couldn't remove it, so i tried one more time and my hand slipped and i cut my finger. crappy food chopper. it didn't chop my veggies up good at all even tho i cut them up so it would fit in the bowl."
2,Somewhat less than enthused,"The chopper works just fine as most of the reviews have said but I percieve a safety problem, at least with the unit I got. The top (motor) section does not lock down on to the bowel. I store my unit in a cabinet on an upper shelf (slightly above my head) and every time I go to get the chopper, the top wants to fall off. It would only take three tabs on the top of the bowel and three tabs on the bottom of the motor unit that could slide over & under each other and the lock down problem is fixed. Another problem I have had is leakage. If I want to chop something with liquid, the liquid leaks out between the motor and bowel. (Actually, splatters all over the counter is a better discription.) A rubber O-ring or some sort of membrain between the bowel and motor unit would cure that problem. Other than that, no real problem."
5,Great Appliance - Must Have!,Very quiet and efficient. Perfect for onions and nuts. I was excited that it fit easily into a small space since I'm starved for cabinet space. I use it at least once a week.
2,don't do it...,"there's nothing ""wrong"" with this product, but i'll tell ya...it's small, too small for most uses. and it's not really any more convenient or easier to clean than a full-sized food processor."
4,Worth every penny if just to cut those onions!,"Like other reviewers, I hate cutting onions, and I was thrilled with the nearly instant work that this chopper made of two medium onions. I just chopped each in half, took off the outer couple of layers, and threw them in. A couple of quick pulses and I had dry eyes and very nicely diced onions ready for my cooking project.I agree with the complaints about the inside top of the unit being hard to clean because it is attached to the motor. It would have been so much better if there was some kind of a liner to toss in the dishwasher. But I am sure I will manage to get the top clean enough for my standards. The only problem will be taking care of it right away before food dries on it.I read through every single review to see how other people are using this little machine. Lots of great ideas. I hope to try them, and I will never cry alone in my kitchen again, no matter how many onions need to be chopped."
4,Capable Food Chopper,I've only used this once to date and so far so good. The only thing I do NOT like is that the top part does not click on securely you need to hold it down. I expected it to click/lock onto the container but it doesn't. It would also have been nice if it came with another 3 cup coverd bowl to chop in.
2,Unobtainable Replacement cup,"Functionally this little chopper works well. But the durability leaves a lot to be desired. After a short time the cup cracked and allowed the spindle upon which the chopper blade revolves to fall out and get lost. I eventually found the spindle and have since super glued in place. I'm pretty good at finding replacement parts for almost anything, but in this case it took me over an hour to find a replacement from a Canadian company at almost the price of the the entire machine. Black & Decker doesn't even include this device in their product list as far as I can see. I will be leery of Black & Decker products in the future."
3,Concerned about durability + no replacement parts,"I really loved this food processor, but shortly after I got it and started to use it, I saw that there were already some cracks appearing in the plastic bowl. Nothing was leaking but I didn't like that the bowl started was cracking so easily. Then about 2 months later, I lost the little metal pin that goes inside the bowl. I've tried to find replacement parts on Black & Decker's website but have been unable to do so thus far. I loved how convenient this was to use (great size for my itty bitty kitchen), but now it's basically useless without the metal pin and a cracking bowl."
5,Great for making baby food,"I was looking for a mini food processor to make baby food. I am very happy i bought this product. The blade is just magical and i am able to puree food without difficulty. Cleaning the top portion can be a little hazzle coz it cant be immersed in water. But for the price nothing can beat this chopper. Overall,works for me. I make large quantity of baby food and freeze them in containers i bought. Why shell out money on costly baby food makers!"
2,"its not a chopper, its a mincer","looking at the overwhelming reviews i bot it without a second thot, but.......... this is not a vegetable chopper, its more like a mincer...i cant get it to chop a little bigger peices, its MINCES them .. and it always leaves some big piece hanging around in the cup which i have to take out n cut it myself, bcos if i run one more round it will cut the already cut pieces even smaller.if you ALWAYS want your vegetables or fruits minced out .. this is for you or else.. its not worth it!!!"
2,Chopped only at blade level,"I was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper. Granted, It could be that what I need to chop (fresh, crisp, sunflower sprouts) is not as easy to process as other ingredients, but I thought it would do just fine, and it didn't. The blade turned, chopping beautifully at blade level. But nothing moved around, so nothing above blade level got down into the blades. It acted like I would have expected it to act if I over-packed it. But if my light-handed filling would be considered over-packing, it's useless to me. Other people have given great reviews, so this unit's effectiveness may have to do with the kind of ingredients you want to chop..."
5,Good & Efficient,"Really like this product. Use it to puree vegetables for soup, to mince vegetables for cooking and to chop nuts. What a timesaver. And it is easy to clean. Dependable!"
4,Grinds Coffee Beans too!,"It's a little bit difficult to clean since the top piece, which contains the motor, can get dirty as you're processing things.It does a great job for such a cheap device though. The chopping/storage bowl, is perfect for making salsa and storing it in the fridge with the lid.I also tried using it to grind coffee beans and got pretty good results. Though, I've never had a coffee grinder so I can't give an authoritative opinion on that."
5,SWIRL CRAZY,"When I got this, I thought I might use it now and then, and that it would be handy for chopping up small batch stuff. It's kind of like the microwave...fought buying one for years thinking ""how lazy can you be not to be able to heat a little water or warm up leftovers in the oven""? I WAS WRONG. I use use my microwave every day and can't live without it....same with this little three cup chopper. I finally just left it out on the counter where it would be handy...THAT'S HOW MUCH I USE IT.Snap to clean, too. Absolutely LOVE it."
3,Starts out great,"I was pleased initially, but then the bowl started leaking when I chop up soups for my baby. And the motor has started to sound like it's working really hard. I'm going to upgrade to something more powerful. I got about 6 months out of this one, using it only to chop baby food (cooked grains and veggies, some cooked chicken)."
2,only lasted 9 months light use,"broke in nine months plastic is weak cracked in different spots, motor failed also, when you pressed the button it would only work sometimes"
1,Did not work,"Had to return it as it did not chop, even tomatoes, very well. There does not seem to be enough power for it to cut vegetables with."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was replacing the one I got 6 or 7 years ago that the blade had become dull. This new one, is not very good at all. When you try to chop pickles, celery, onion, chicken, etc...you get big chunks that have not been chopped very well. I did not have this problem with the other Food Chopper. I am going back to the old one. This one doesn't get the job done."
5,Wonderful little food processor,"I've had my Black and Decker food processor for seven years, an earlier model obviously, and have loved it. It is small enough to store easily and simple enough to get out for even small, quick jobs. It comes apart and washes beautifully, either by hand or in the dishwasher. It has enough power to crush ice. Mine is finally on it's last legs so I am buying another. I highly recommend this product."
4,Pretty good stuff,"Great little machine, like the grip/lid that comes with it, not an effective way to clean the top, but easy to use overall"
4,"Compact, safe, easily assembled and cleaned workhorse","We have numerous gadgets and appliances lurking about our cupboards and this is one I actually use on a regular basis. It is quick and simple to use - I don't have to retrieve numerous parts and assemble them, and clean-up is a breeze. What I like about the B&D vs. others is that it doesn't have an extra base, since the motor is in the top, making it very compact (the base is the bowl). It's safe to use because it won't work unless all three parts are together. After 7 or 8 years of use, the bowl has cracked, so it has leaked, and I am now purchasing a second one - seems like a good lifespan for a motorized product that was purchased for less than 20.00."
2,Got dull quickly,"It wasnt all that expensive so maybe I shouldnt complain. When I want something softer onion for instance, diced, I still have to use a knife. Disappointing. Works ok but it doesn't really chop because it loses its sharpness quickly. I have tried it with a few things and it seems to shred more than chop. Much better suited for hard or dry stuff, like prunes and figs maybe."
2,Marginal,"The design with top controls cumbersome and non-ergonomic to say the least. While it probably chops as well as most mini choppers out there, the difficulties with cleaning outweigh that benefit. The center pin under the blades keeps coming out and if you are not watchful you'll lose it rendering the machine useless. While it can't be compared to full size food processor, I find it can only handle small amounts at a time and chops unevenly at that. My prior Kitchen Aid mini was superior."
3,Pre-Chop for your Chopper,"You read that right. If I do not pre-chop carrots to 1/2"" thickness, the blades don't seem to be able to handle the chopping. What ends up happening is the carrots get stuck in the blades, the chopper turns, but it doesn't do anything beside turning. So I pre-chop the carrots for the chopper. Kind of defeats the purpose, but it is still easier than having to shred them by hand."
3,top motor unit in contact with food,I had bought the processor after my Sunbeam Little Oskar died. It is small and compact and does a good job of chopping small amounts of food. However I am returning it because the top part which contains the motor unit is directly on the food making it harder to clean. I will buy a chopper that is fully enclosed and all I have to do is put the chopping chamber into the dishwasher.
1,Nice product undermined by serious design flaw,"Nice ergonomic design and good chopper but poor design quality. After a couple of uses the chopper developed a hairline crack in the base that ran from the metal pin (that supports the blade) radially outward. We returned the chopper for an identical replacement item and the same thing happened again after just several uses (this time returned for a refund). As noted by another reviewer, this appears to be a design flaw rather than a manufacturing defect. My guess is that while in use the post must be exerting too much pressure for the thickness of the plastic base to withstand. This is unfortunate since in principle the product is a nice concept."
5,Black & Decker Food Chooper,"You can't beat this chopper for the price be careful blades are very sharp, it cuts the fine and speed 2 cuts it bigger I read some people said it was a bit noisey but I didn't find it to be a problem."
5,Best Chopper!,Most choppers I have had in the past were either too small or just pureed everything. This B&D product holds the perfect amount AND really chops without liquifying everying. Conumer Reports magazine rated it highly which is why I bought it...I'm glad I did.
4,Great little chopper,"This is the 2nd Black & Decker Ergo food chopper I have bought. The first one was for myself and I liked it so much that I bought one for my mom. We both keep it on our countertops because we use it almost every day. Easy to clean, fast and doesn't pulverize tomatoes. I use it for fresh salsa, guacamole, deli style tuna and chopping those dreaded onions and garlic! This is a must have for any kitchen."
3,Food Pulverizor,"I was really hoping for a product that would dice my food as well as mince it. Even though there are two settings for processing, both reduce whatever food I add to a liquid consistency. Not really what I expected. So I am still dicing my vegetables. I pull this out when I want to make a fresh salsa or guacamole."
2,Black & Decker EHC650 food chopper,"I bought this for small jobs. It's easy to use, set up, and clean.But ...It only handles very small amounts of veggies. One half an onion quartered piled up and caused the blades to stop. The motor is quite small.I'm dissapointed but the price is low so it's not a big deal.W."
4,traveler's delight,"great little machine for light work, I've had no problems in chopping- so far works with everything. Recommend for anyone who can't chew regular food, handy enough to take while traveling or on the go where an electrical plug is available, ex. hotel room."
4,Perfect Chopper,"Step 1- open boxStep 2- clean all washable parts with warm soapy water, dryStep 3- start chopping!If loving the Ergo 3-Cup Food Chopper is wrong, I don't wanna be right. Let's face it-I'm girly, even in the kitchen. For some reason, I can not NOT cry when chopping onions. Holding a slice of bread in my teeth, lighting candles, wearing goggles, rinsing under cold water-NOTHING helps. I tossed medium sized hunks of onion into this little cutie and pulsed a few times. Perfectly chopped onions. I washed it, dried it, and then tossed in chunks of mozzarella. A few pulses and I had mounds of gorgeously white shredded pizza cheese (I only call it that because I was making pizza!)I have confidence and lust for this food chopper. I am putting my not-so-magic-bullet in the back of the cabinet and my new B&D; gets center stage. I've used it 4 days in a row. I wonder how long the blade will stay sharp?"
5,Would be perfect if it wasn't for the grip part,"The blue grip part of this item may stain. So if your using tomatoes clean your hands before grabbing this part because it does not come off, even with soap and water."
2,Spend a little more on a better Food Chopper!,"I bought this thinking, well I only cook a little bit, so I'll just spend this much on this and it'll be OK. I WAS WRONG. If I could turn back time, I would've spent a little more on a bigger/better chopper. This does the job, but you have to keep on doing it in small batches or else the blades will get stuck and will stop working. Save time and effort, skip this one."
5,Perfect for small jobs,"I received this food chopper two months ago for my birthday. I've used it at least once every week since then. It works wonderfully for small jobs, like chopping a vegetable or blending small helpings of pesto and salsa. Also, I found that it does a great job chopping nuts. Its fast, quiet, and easy to clean. I recommend it."
1,Motor failed after 1 use,I purchased this food chopper so that I could make Tzatziki sauce. The cucmber was chopped quite fine and I was delighted until I tried to use the chopper for a second time. No bueno por nada!
3,Excellent final third but ...,"Monologues can be an effective approach to novels (Tabucchi, Hrabel,Tuck and Kolitz come to mind). However, to be effective the reader needs to be sympathetic/empathetic to the speaker or the problem. Unfortunately, for the first two-thirds of this novel Samuel Perlman was a bitter, uninteresting character. However, the last third places Perlman's isolation/desolation into a broader existential, Jewish, Kabbalistic context. Finally, his issues become issues of humanity - how to create a life, a persona to stave off desolation.The author provides a very consistent voice and a dry humor that makes the novel an enjoyable read."
3,Interesting monologue,"Written in the form of a monologue, this short novel is about the life, disappointments and losses of an old man. Disappointed at his son for lacking ambition and embracing mediocrity, the narrator shares his thoughts of his life, his friends and the events that shaped his life.The novel and the language are interesting. However, I did not feel any compassion or sympathy towards the character. He is an old man bitter with disappointment at everyone around him. Yet, he himself, despite his talks of thriving in conflict and turmoil, has avoided conflict all his life and continues to do so with his wife, dauther and her family. While he does not claim he is perfect he also does not take any responsibility for anything or anyone.While the monologue technique was interesting, I found the book mediocre."
4,Camedia Cable,The Camedia USB cable arrived in good condition in 4 days. Would order again from this vendor.
3,A great companion to Sound Murder,If you have Remarc's 'Soundmurder' album check this out next. More of the same twisted use of the Amen break and ragga jungle sound. I like!
5,IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE,"What could be more mundane--trees in the city? But, take a second (and third...) look at Bayles's work and it will change the way you SEE the urban experience. This is truly great photography--it refreshes our viewpoint, presents the average as exceptional, recasts reality in new forms. Sierra Club has done a brave book--as revolutionary as their titles in the early 60s. Bravo!"
1,Urban green beauty,I bought this book because the author's wife is an old friend of mine. Beautiful photography and very informative and great quality.
1,BEWARE OF BREAKOUT!!!,"I have NEVER had sensitive skin and have tried well over 100 different skin care creams, serums and treatments in the last 15 or so years. I have even been using Olay Touch of Sun daily moisturizer for months with no ill effects. BUT - the Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating cream is HORRIBLE. I used it once in the morning and once again that night. The next day I had little bumps covering my neck, forehead and temples. It has been 4 days and they are still there. It looks like lizard skin at the moment and I have never been more horrifed. My upper lip even swelled in the center. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT - ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN."
1,Such a waste of $,"I can't believe I used this product and didn't do my research! I research EVERYTHING before buying and just figured I'd save about $20 by getting this cream... I now have a red bumpy rash all over my jawline and neck and I have great non-sensitive skin. It is starting to itch, what the heck do they put in this stuff? I thought (similar to another's review) that the bumps in the beginning were just part of the regeneration process.. but they won't go away. I am tossing this product immediately and strongly recommend that you do NOT buy it under any circumstances."
1,Contains fragrance,"The product felt wonderful on my face and neck, but I noticed it smelled a little ""too"" good. After two days of use, my face was broken out so much that I looked like I had hit puberty overnight. If fragrances don't irritate your skin, you may be fine, but I'd look at purchasing another product if you're prone to breakouts. I took some Claritin and quit using the cream, my skin was pretty much back to normal after a few days. I have some latent irritation, though, on my neck."
1,"my face is swollen, burned and a rash all over it.","I used this product for two days and I woke up to a swollen, bumpy, burning skin. Day two still the same, a little less burn. I will never use anything like this again or anything from this company. I look terrible and feel awful."
2,Made me break out,"Everyone reacts differently, and this product made me break out. I would test it out on a small patch of skin to see how you react."
5,"Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7 Fluid Ounde","I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin. It relieves the tight, pulling feeling of the skin on my face."
5,love it,this again is a lovely product for my wifes moisturizing. She loves it. she loves it.. she loves it..loves it
1,made my eyes itch & burn,"This product is terrible - the scent is much too strong for a product that is used on the face. I didn't get it anywhere close to my eyes, but 2 minutes after using it, my eyes started to itch, burn and swell so badly that I had to take an antihistamine and put ice cubes on my eyes to get the irritation & swelling to go down. I am going to call Olay to get my money back."
5,Amazing,I bought this to try and hydrate my skin( I have Psoriasis) and its amazing how it helps hydrate my skin.
3,Clogged pores,"I like the product, but it's not the best for me. I tried it because I prefer its pump bottle format over the jar that my night recovery comes in. This product gave me tiny clogged pores, almost like milia on both cheeks. Also, the fragrance is a bit overpowering for my allergies and asthma. So I'm back to the Regenerist Night Recovery treatment, which is a much better choice for me."
1,Careful,"Have been using regenerist products for a very long time however, this product caused a rash on my cheeks and an intense burning feeling."
5,Perfecting Cream,"Nice texture and lightly fragranced. Leaves skin soft. Have only used for about a week; no miracles so far, :), but I like the product."
1,Bad break outs and skin on fire,"I don't have sensitive skin & only have an occasional pimple, but after a week of using this, my face is full of intense breakouts that professionals cannot calm. I quit using this 4 days ago yet my skin is still raw and looks terrible. I use a Clarsonic & take care of my skin , but sadly the Olay Regen isn't working for me. I was hoping something with peptides would be beneficial. Still looking for organic products with anti aging derivatives. Anyone know of a well received cream? Was using La Mer before this. May need to return to the pricey product. :("
5,just the right feel,"This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever tried. My skin is dry and flaky in my T-zone (forehead, nose)in the winter, and this lotion penetrates deeply with just the right thickness to absorb quickly and be effective."
5,Love it.,Does it make me look younger? Who knows but it makes my skin feel good. I love Olay products. I buy them here when they are on sale.
1,skin is burning,"Burned my face,under one eye is very red,skin on side of my face is peeling away to another layer. Used it for 3 days only, just so strong I guess A waste of 20.00 never again,just wonder how long it will take until its all gone?"
5,great moisturizer,"I have used face creams in all price levels from 200.00 to this cream, believe it or not this hydrates the best. Definitely wonderful for dry skin."
3,Gave me a rash after a week,"I bought this when a airline lost my luggage on the way to Kodiak, AK. I settled on this product, when I couldn't find a cheap Jojoba or Vit E. Oil at a local drug store. I used it at night only, since it doesn't include SPF. It seemed to be hydrating without being oily. I kept using it for a week at night, even after finding my luggage. I ended up trashing a full bottle due to breakout and a bit of a rash developing on my cheek. Back to Jojoba and La Posay Roche.This just reinforces why I never buy drugstore products."
2,Break-out causer,"I don't have especially sensitive skin, but it is dry. This product did not feel very moisturizing, but it made me break out. I thought it might be something else, but I quit using it for a few days, and my skin cleared up. Then when I tried it again, I immediately had another breakout. If you have sensitive skin, skip this cream!"
5,Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream,I really like the consistency. My skin has improved so much during the last two weeks. Good bargain price. Thank you.
3,Good Moisturizer,"Positives:-The moisturizer hydrates very well.-Smells good.Negatives:-Pricey.-The fragrance is a bit overwhelming.-No SPF.-The formula is a tad bit on the greasy side.-Product has also caused me to break out a little bit. Never really had any pimples present until I used this product more frequently. This may be due to my sensitive acne prone skin, but that's just me.Overall: Good product, but you can spend the same amount of money and buy a better moisturizer that's non comedogenic and has an SPF. Also, the texture is a little too thick for my taste. You only get a small amount for the price. The bottle only lasted me for about month. I'd rate this product as average."
3,TOO PERFUMED,"I have used Olay Regeneris products for several years and been pleased. I tried this one and found that it has a nice texture that is easily absorbed and feels very nice, But it has a very strong perfume that I find unpleasant.I will not buy it again."
1,"The Dengerous, Slow, Bulky, Unclean toaster EVER","I've been using this toaster only because my roommate left it.Requires a lot of space to use, messy crumbs see through from glass window and tend to mess around the area. Slow ... very slow to toast anything, plus every time it burns my toast with no exception. Can't toast anything small .. will stuck and you'll see big flame in a minute .. so you'll have to stand in front of it and watch entire process to extinguish it. You can neither toast big thing because there is no enough space.So, why would you still buy one?"
4,Build a better mouse-trap...,"Do we *really* need a ""better"" toaster? Does the Arize really provide a better way to toast (and better tasting toast, as the box claims)?Um, yeah.I give high marks for the easy-to-clean design of this toaster-- the crumb tray slides out without neading to un-plug and pick up the toaster. Both glass sides open up granting nearly unobstructed access to the inside (which is largely empty, anyway. This little feature came in handy the very first day-- made extricating bits of an english muffin easy and fuss free.Better toast? Maybe. I think this toaster takes longer than your garden-variety toaster, but this is offset its excellent compatibility with odd-shaped bread (like flatter, home-made breads sliced thickly). And this i the first ""bagle-compatible"" toaster i've used that actually was!"
5,excellent value,"It takes little space. Easy to use. Pop in the toast or bagle, push the button and it's done. I want to give them as gifts. Just can't find them now."
5,Unusual Looking Toaster That Toasts Better Than Conventional Toasters,"I love the look of this toaster and I think it does a better job of toasting bread than conventional toasters. You do have to keep an eye on it because if the top of the bread curls and gets too close to the heating element it will burn, smoke, and probably catch fire if not taken care of. My solution if this happens is to use wooden tongs to pull the bread away from the heating element until it starts back up. This only happened a couple of times. When I use thicker bread this hasn't been a problem. Make sure you do the preliminary adjustment that is listed on the sticker by the controls before you use it for the first time."
1,ABLAZE is more like it...,"Would you care for some toast using the Ablaze? ....Step 1: Make sure your dailing fingers are first positioned on the phone to call 911 ! ! ! ! ! ! Step 2: Insert bread, stand back, and watch for rising smoke.I bought this product because it is made by Black and Decker...BIG MISTAKE...It is an accident waiting to happen...we have to watch the toaster like a hawk so we can stop the bread - no matter what kind it is - from burning to a crisp and taking us and the house down with it.WHY HASN'T BLACK AND DECKER TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY AND INITIATED A RECALL ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??We've stopped using the toaster BUT I am returning to them for a refund or product exchange.DO NOT BUY."
1,Don't Buy Thias Toaster!!!,"Thought this cool looking toaster by Black & Decker would look great in my new kitchen, which it does. The problem is, everything it toasts catches on fire!! My daughter was toasting bread and flames started shooting out of the top. We haven't found anything yet that wouldn't burn. Don't waste your money unless of course you want your house to burn down..."
1,burnomatic,"The control has a very fine line between raw and burned. It the toast is not perfectly vertical (say the bottom curls out a bit) that bit will be black. The last straw was the toast that got jammed. The heater element does not shut down until the carriage reaches the top so no matter how many times you push the emergency release button, the heat keeps coming. The flames were shooting out the top. Very entertaining but not very safe. Unplugging it and using a pair of tongs the flaming toast was rushed to the sink.Stay away from this dangerous bad idea in toasters."
1,Terrible toaster,"The first thing we found out is that you can't fit two slices of bread side by side. So you have to turn one of them sideways with the wide part vertical. Then this slice droops over halfway through, so part of it is untoasted and part of it is burnt, and sometimes gets jammed. Even if you do one slice at a time, it toasts very unevenly and inconsistently. It also toasts English muffins very poorly, usually burning parts and leaving other parts untoasted. The only good thing about it is that it's easy to clean out crumbs. I regret buying this toaster, especially given its high price."
3,Okay,I didn't care too much for the singing on this cd. It was just okay in my opinion. I would not buy it again.
3,Over Exagerated,"I make a point of listening to all my tapes by myself, before using them with clients. I purchased this one based on all the excellent reviews, but in my experience it did not live up to my expectations. The music started out well enough, but way before it was over, I was wishing it was over. I found it too repetitive, and frankly not interesting enough. It did not take me into deeper states of relaxation. However if used by a massage therapist who is working on the body, it would no doubt be a much better experience."
1,Should be a short story not a book,"Such a big deal was made of his courage to tell the truth about Princess Diana's death, well one chapter doesn't explain it. In fact this book is about beating up on a woman that was loved by many. Luck for Princess Diana the public will love her no matter what a money hungry writer will say. Also shame on the people(magazine writers)that misrepresented this book. Total disappointed and a waste of time and money"
2,No ability to contact seller,No option to select specific color for daughter for whom liked color. Trying to buy for Christmas gift. But delivery was fast and otherwise very exceptional. Would like yhe opportunity to exchange for prefered color... Great quality product.
1,"was used, broken and glued together","Who sells and ships something that is used, broken and glued together ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?"
5,Works as advertised,"My company bought some new PCs that didn't have any serial/parallel ports (but we need these for our POS equipment). This product works well (i.e. after you install it you forget it's there because it just works, month after month). I'm writing this review because it's kind of hard to find products like this for USB-only PCs, but this Startech adapter is a winner."
5,StarTech 2S1P PCI Serial Parallel Combo Card is great,"I purchased this to add to my hp desktop that did not come with a parallel port--I actually did not need the serial ports, but for a dollar more than just a parallel port, I thought it won't hurt to have them just in case! Installation took abot 5 minutes and my windows7 instantly recognized it and there was no need to use the installation cd! I connected my plotter - which is over 10 years old- to it, did a plotter set up, and it started working. Couldn't be happier. As far as serial ports go, I have not tested them because I don't have any device that require serial port connection! Great product."
4,"Great product, however...","I absolutely loved these binoculars when I first got them and still do. But here recently I had a black spot appear on the right side while viewing and its not dirt or trash on the lens. It is inside the binoculars and I do not look forward to sending them in for warranty any time soon, because not sure how much longer I will be at this address. But the spot is very noticeable when viewing close up or at any range when viewing lite bright colored back drops."
4,"Great optics, low weight, incredible performance","I bought these for an African safari. The focus was fast, the optics great and they were not cumbersome in the slightest. We experienced both dry and dusty days as well as steady rain and these binoculars stood up to the elements. The only issue I had was with the lens cap attachment to the binoculars (hence the 1-star deduction) - this could be improved. The caps easily detach and could be lost if you are not paying attention."
1,Disappointing,The image shows 14 glass beads however the bracelet I received had only 13.If you have a medium + size wrist this bracelet will be a tight fit.Disappointed I was 'short changed'!
4,Lovely bracelet!,"I just received three of these bracelets and they are lovely. I have all 14 beads the size is perfect for my wrist and the beads are glass! When I compare the bracelets to a Millefiori necklace I bought in Venice you can't tell them apart, except the beads are a little larger on the bracelet, otherwise a perfect match! Great costume jewelry!"
4,Oh so slick,"It's a fascinating series on a number of levels, and it has to be said that not every episode really hangs together, but most do. It feels contemporary and the on location filming will always preserve it with that genuine on the road feel..and, speaking of On the Road, are we to, I suppose, come to the conclusion that Buzz Murdoch is based on Jack Kerouac? Or is that just a redundant question..Play it Glissando is fantastic, I mean Jack Lord and Anne Francis in the same episode. Both a melancholy and upbeat series in some ways, too, presenting a golden encapsulation of a free America but, also a presentation of its transitory, fleeting glories. This is one series that can be genuinely called classic, and personally I found the video quality to be as good as you can hope for.Roll on Vol 2!"
2,Not Very Good for the $$$,"This is a poorly remastered dvd for the money. Could be of better quality. Also, why isn't this dvd ""closed captioned"" or ""subtitled"" in compliance with the ADA law (Americans with Disabilities Act)? Just ridiculous. SG"
4,get your kicks....,"I got my copy of 66 today by direct courier (no less) and what the reviewerssay about it being dark and audio not as being so clear is all true. How-ever, it's a piece of Americana. It was the first show that used alllocation shots. Not the kind of show where you see a character walk into abuilding on location and the next shot was in a studio. An enjoyable showthat I vaguely appreciated at age 8. Now that I am some what older, I understand why my parents loved this show."
5,Cool is In Once More!,"The two cool cats are once more cruising across the USA, well at least on our televisions. It is proper that a show of this caliber be offered in a DVD format. This release is a positive trend. One can hope that other quality TV series from the early to mid 1960's will follow. 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, Surfside Six and of course ""Live From Miami Beach, it's the Jackie Gleason Show!"" And Awaaaaay We Go!Adendum: Let us write and await a better quality product than Vol 1. With the technical abilities at our disposal today, I expected a better image and sound quality. I have not regrets buying the first DVD, but the future copy tranfers need to be sharpened."
3,"""Route 66 -- Season I Volume I""","This item was ordered on May 12, 2010. I thought it would certainly arrive by May 24 when my husband & I left on our Route 66 trip but it never came; I found it in my pile of mail when we returned home in June. I was very disappointed by the service. I'll watch the episodes when I get around to it, I guess."
5,Route 66 DVD,The product came in a timely fashion. The format is easy to use and quality is excellent.
4,Good Guys Can Finish First!,"Unlike many Regency ""heroes"" St. John WANTS to marry. But somehow he keeps asking the wrong girl! As he tries to make the trip down the aisle, he meets a series of women who made me laugh and want to cry for poor St. John!Throughout the book, we get to know Althea and St. John very well and for once they also get to know each other. What a touching ending! Well worth the read-- so much fun."
1,"well, it did work - for about 2 months . . .","I bought the littermaid last year and was very scrupulous about the amount and type of litter used and keeping the sensors clean, etc. My cat loved watching the rake clean up after her, and I liked having an appliance do her dirty work.BUT-- I went out of town for a few days and came back to find the littermaid was totally out of whack, running nonstop for up to an hour at a time. Although I cleaned it thoroughly, and it worked for about a week after that, it soon malfunctioned again and I was unable to ever get it to work properly again for more than a day or two at a time.Bottom line: I wouldn't buy this product again. It was not worth the money, and I now own a very inexpensive ""self-cleaning litter box"" that rolls- no fancy mechanical devices, no fussing with litter depth or weight. I'm happy, the cats are happy (we now have two), and clean up is a snap!"
1,Waste of space,"I bought this product one day when I was tired of yelling at my children to clean the cat box. What a waste of money! We didn't have an electrical outlet close enough to the floor to plug the thing in so we had to use batteries which we went through alarmingly quickly. More litter was deposited on the floor than in the receptacle and every surface above the litter line got disgusting. To make it worse, there are a million little cracks and crevices, not even including the tines, that make cleaning the darn thing a time consuming chore. Even using hard clumping litter, lots of gunk got left in pan so we had to sift anyway! Don't waste your money!"
1,Just not a good machine,"""I have not had this box but I have had three other boxes. The first one lasted for about three years.I was very happy with it and did not expect any trouble with another. We got a new one and simply didn't compare to the old one. The lid would not close. It was constantly getting jammed and the top of the plastic container would come loose leaving cat poop on top of the machine. That one broke with in six months. Coustmer service was very poor. My daughter bought me an elight mega one.It work great but broke a little after a year. I will not buy another one."" > LitterMaid LM900 Mega Self-Cleaning Litter Box"
2,LitterMaid stopped working after guarantee ended,I bought this litter box. It worked great for a year. About a week after the store guarantee ended so did the product. Rake would no longer work properly. It got stuck in the middle and would make a horendous noise. Finally went back to disposible kitty kitter pans. Now looking for a better product on the market.
2,A Great Idea But......,"I gave this litter box 2 stars for a great idea. I love that, if I am busy, I do not have to worry about scooping out the litter box. The problem is that we are on our second one in two years and these things are expensive. They seem to last just long enough for the warranty to run out. Our second one just stopped working and can't be repaired. Also, even if I get the hard clumping litter that comes with the litter box, the pieces often break apart or stick to the rake as it is sweeping the box. My next tact will be to try a different brand. For more than one hundred dollars, I need the box to work flawlessly and to last more than one year."
4,Litter Maid automatic self cleaning cat boxes,"I have two Litermaid cat boxes, one large and one small. I have six cats. The two boxes are entirely adequate and I am quite happy with them. One caveat: Be certain you use good quality clumping litter. I use Tidy Cats clumping litter for multiple cats, but I have used other brands of clumping litter. With six cats I need to change the litter container more often than Litter Maid says.The down side is that the large box quit after 2 1/2 years -- but I am going to replace it with another large LitterMaid box. It is a good product."
4,LitterMaid lasted 8 years: this is a replacement.,"The old LitterMaid lasted 8 years and the wire to the rake motor broke and cannot be replaced. The new LitterMaid PLUS came with a rug to put under the box. Shopping around, we found 1 locally for the same sale price as the net. (about $90 + tax)We used Arm & Hammer litter and empty the waste bin about 4 times a week. Benefits are Katie is happy and easier on us. BTW, we had to exchange the first one to the store because the rake was jammed from the 12 replacement litter containers that came with the LitterMaid."
1,Biggest Waste of Money! Do not buy one!,"I wish we had the option for ZERO STARS! This item deserves ero stars as it is not worth the money. It would not be worth it even if it was under $10! I purchased the Mega box in February 2005 as a gift for my cat at tax time. I was hoping the reduce the amount of cleaning we do to a few times a week and save money on litters & supplies. Well, it worked great up until last September 2005. Now it frequently jams while trying to rack the waste to the recepticle. I spent about $200 on this and it did not last a year. I find that this is a waste of money. I am now replacing the Mega Box with the old fashion litterbox. After reading so many complaints on this machine, I strongly advise that you give up on this path and stick with the standard box. It will save you time and aggrivation even though you have to scoop out the box yourself."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this and was extremely disappointed!It does a poor job raking the litter and tends to jam up very easily. It only holds about 3"" deep of litter so you constantly have to refill the litter. This turned out to be more of a job than using a regular litter box. I sent it back!The idea behind it's system is good, but it needs a stronger motor, and a much more effienct raking system."
1,Returned two defective ones,"Our 16 year old cat has had a wonderful LitterMaid Self-Cleaning Litter box for 10 years. Then one day it died. So not wanting to upset the opld girl I bought her a new one. All it did was rake rake rake. It would not stop. I called the company & we tried the reset procedure. No luck. I returned it & got a new one - - same problem. I reset & it just kept raking. I returned the second one as well. They were both defective unfortunately.So I ordered a smaller one from LitterMaid, the LM700 I believe (or something like that) it works beautifully. I don't expect it to last 10 years like our first - - but it would be nice.I will continue to use this brand as the very first one did run for 10 years."
2,Overrated,"I was disappointed in the product overall. If you have a cat or cats that like to sometimes pile everything in one corner, the rake will malfunction due to the load. Also, the receptacle is not very easy to take out once it is full."
4,Good Product,"I recieved my order early and it also came with some extras such as recepticles, scooper, and a brush! The only thing that was strange was the top and bottom parts were a different color so they must have been parts from other machines. This litter maid is the best out of any other model. Don't buy the new and improved ones in the store they suck!"
2,worked for one day,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing.This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level. I must have overfilled by 1/4"" or so, because it stopped working properly after the first day. The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle.With such shallow litter, my cats had trouble digging and covering.The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative.I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control. And another clock in the house is always handy."
1,"Tulsa, OK",I do not usually take the time to write product reviews but I am writing this one in lieu of sending a letter to the manufacturer. I purchased a LitterMaid litter box approximately 6 years ago and was very pleased with the product. The motor eventually burned out so I purchased a second LitterMaid litter box approximately a year ago. Parts are now cheap and do not assemble properly. You cannot remove the litter receptable area to empty the soiled litter. You have to empty the entire unit. One of the guiders on the rake broke after 6 months. I gave up. Will never buy another one.
2,Terrible product,"I bought the Littermaid for my three cats about a year ago thinking it would reduce the hassle of cleaning the box. Turns out, I was wrong. You don't have to clean the box as much anymore, but the Littermaid's rake gets stuck constantly and you have to scoop the box and/or clean the rake to get it unstuck. The motor in the Littermaid seems too weak for the job it has. As of yesterday, about 15 months after buying it, mine broke entirely. I thinkI'm going to go back to just a regular litterbox."
3,LitterMaid is self-cleaning-- but not self-fixing,"This litter box is ingenious in its idea and simplicity, but not well designed at all. My two-cat family has gone through three or four LitterMaids in seven years. Each time they were under warranty, but it took hours on the phone to get them to send us a new one. Customer ""Service"" is horrible! Summarized: Great idea, not great design or customer service"
2,Not Worth the Hassle,"If you want something that works all the time, use your hand. The LitterMaid is nice when it works, but so far it has gotten stuck every other day. I've been using Arm & Hammer cat litter, which is recommended by the manufacturer. The main problem is that it doesn't give the litter enough time to harden up, so when it rakes the box, ""stuff"" will get stuck and will cause the machine to either run non-stop or will stop running altogether. You will wind up scooping litter from the LitterMaid box about as much as you would a regular one."
4,Silicone Spray,"We've used this litterbox for more than 3 years now. We have 2 cats that are quite competetive in their box activities. I agree with many of the reviews...the litter does clump at times and then the rake is unable to complete its sweep of the pan. We currently use Fresh Step (we've tried them all). I hose the litter pan and rake down every month or so and when its dry, I spray it with 2 coats of SILICONE SPRAY to decrease muddy litter patches. !!Spray anything that touches the litter!!I hate cleaning the litter box, but partial scooping every 1-2 days is better than daily changes, any day of the week. Enjoy! P.S. Have you seen the power booster cable advertised to give the rake a li'l ooomph?"
5,LITTERMAID LITTER BOX,I AM HANDICAP AND IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO KEEP REGULAR BOX CLEAN WITH LITTERMAID DOES THE JOB FOR ME ALSO KEEPS THE ORDER DOWN JUST BOUGH MY 2ND FOR MY HOME IN FL I LOVE IT
2,Don't do it!,"Don't buy it. I had it and it worked great for 1 1/2 weeks and my cats used it. Than it stopped working! Just stopped. I've tried everthing except send it back, to LitterMaid, which am going to do."
2,Avoid the hassle,"Forget the LitterMaid...save yourself the hassle and spend the extra money to get a Litter-Robot. One of the happiest days of my life was when I was able to get rid of the LitterMaid and use regular trash bags to line the collector of the Litter-Robot. They're priced a bit higher, but definitely worth the extra money."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This litter box should be recalled. It works well for a short time, and then completely stops functioning. Google this item and read the many consumer complaints. I found Litter Maid customer service to be extremely unhelpful. Do not waste your money on this product."
3,Great product for the week it worked.....,My Littermaid worked for only 10 days. I followed the directions to a T and today it just stopped working. I think the maybe the motor in this product is very sensitive. Wish I'd listened to other reviewers.
1,This thing is junk!,"I should have returned this thing because it will not stop running. I had one of these litter boxes which lasted for about 4 yrs. then died, so this was a replacement. I will not buy another one, because now I have to turn it on, then turn it off manually. What a waste of money!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"We bought this item 2 months ago and it quit working after one month.We used the premium litter but the ""cat material"" clumped up and the rake couldn't move it. It created a real mess.Also, it sounded like a loud, dying chainsaw whenever it was doing it's thing. It was just struggling to move even the tiniest amount of stuff."
3,"Can't live with it, can't live without it","My model 900 was great until last night. This was my 3rd littermaid. The last two didn't last too long. This one was less than 2 years old. Stops for unknown reason. But, with a multiple cat household, it is so much more convenient that scooping all day long, and it is definitely much better on odor. However, for the price, it should not die so young. I did go out in a panic and bought no. 4, cheaper version (though still expensive) the elite 5000 because it was the only one I could find, but I think I am going to regret it. I'll see how it does, but I hate to have to keep spending money like this, and I predict it won't last that long anyway. Most of these machines can probably be fixed, a ex- littermaid repair person told me, but unless I can do it myself (he sent me a manual but I can't find it now,) it just doesn't pay to keep sending them back, and of course they didn't break until after the warranty ended."
3,Great product but......,"Love litter maid, couldn't live with out it. Especially in a house with 3 cats. But this is our 3rd one. Like any thing they wear out with use. Usually only lasting 1-3 years. It might be longer if you don't have as many cats using it."
4,Glad that I found this model,I had this model for years and during a move it was broken. I bought a newer LitterMaid model and HATED it. I went to every pet store in town trying to find this older model and thank goodness I found it on Amazon. I happily threw the other model out and am back to a happy litter box. I can't imagine not having this litter box....life wouldn't be as easy. The cats are happier too.
2,"Worked amazing for a week, ok for a while, then broke a month later","It worked amazingly for the first week I had it. It was great. Then it started to get problems. The litter would clump to the rake every time. It'd have trouble pushing the clumps into the receptacle.Last week, it got stuck in the ""all the way"" extended position. The rake is blocking the receptacle so I can't take the poop out, but it's also holding the lid open so the smell permeates. It won't retract the rake, no matter if I fiddle with the on and off switch, try to push it back manually, whatever."
1,Newer isn't always better,"My previous unit lasted 8 years. The cat loved it and even the kids didn't mind emptying it. So when the retracting spring broke and couldn't be fixed, I ordered a new one. This one has been problems from the start. The motor is weaker and can't always get the chunks into the receptacle, Litter sticks to the bottom of the tray and when it does rake it, it leaves some litter between the rakes on the bottom. I have to scoop it every couple days to get the stuff that stuck to the bottom. And now it won't rake at all. So we are back to scooping on a daily basis. At least it has a receptacle to scoop into."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I went through 2 of these things before I gave up. The first one the motor died within 2 weeks. Thinking it was a fluke I returned it and got another one. The 2nd one never really cleaned the box. It would scrape everything to the edge of the box but never dump it in the tray. So I still had to go clean the box everyday anyway. Finally after dealing with that for 5-6 months I threw it away and went back to the old reliable litter box. If I have to clean the ""self cleaning"" box I might as well have something that isn't horribly noisey in my house. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk!!"
4,got better things to do than scoop poo...,"I really do love our littermaid. We bought our first a couple of years ago and bought the mega sized. It finally wore out and this time we accidentaly bought the smaller version, but we think it actually works better. Maybe because the motor doesn't have to power the rake to travel as far? The best tip I have is don't waste all the money on the receptacles. Buy one box of them and then use plastic grocery bags to ""line"" each before placing the receptacle in the litterbox. There is plenty of room under the receptacle for the excess bag. Clean up is even easier when all you have to do is pop the receptacle out, find the handles on the bag and pull it out, tie it, and dump it in the OUTSIDE garbage (it's pretty stinky). One receptacle can last for ages that way...and no having to wash them out by hand."
3,Good product but customer service is non-existent,"I purchased the Littermaid Mega LM950 from our local BJ's on 7/28/2008. During assembly I noticed that the AC Adapter was not in the packaging, thus I called the company (now Applica?). As of this writing I've been on hold for over an hour the 3 times I've called (their voice menus are very confusing), not to mention the 5 or so emails I've sent have gotten the run around.Today, 8/4/2008 I STILL have NO answer to if I will receive a replacement adapter, OR where to find one. I'm not pleased whatsoever with this company!"
1,POS,"This litter box is not worth the money. I have had to have it replaced three times because the motor has stopped. I use the premium clumping litter and follow the directions completely and still it is insufficient. Then my cat urinated on the motor compartment and the motor burned up!! It's a LITTER BOX! It should not break because a cat used it!!!! Now my ""warranty"" is expired by one month and the company won't do anything for me. DO NOT BUY THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT!"
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I have two cats and thought this machine would be a great helper with unappealing litter box chores. Well, I spent more time scraping ""stuff"" out of the rake than I previously did just scooping and dumping with my traditional litter box. The rake would adhere to the solid waste while attempting to carry it into the waste receptacle. This would make the machine get stuck going back and forth repeatedly trying to dump the waste. Also, this machine is pretty loud. I had to turn it off in the evening so it wouldn't scare everyone in the middle of the night. One of my cats hated the screeching sound of the machine so much that she resorted to using one of my secondary bedrooms as a litter box to avoid the machine (she has NEVER done this before and she's almost 7 years old). I returned the machine to Amazon and have happily gone back to scooping 2-3 times a day."
2,Not for more than one cat!,This is the first review I have ever done (I am the daughter-in-law of the women with this account). I bought two of these and I had four fully-grown cats. It worked (with lots of loving) for a little less than a year. They have both died. I cleaned the unit out all the time. The plastic inserts that you must buy are expensive. If you have a cat that likes to fling litter - litter gets everywhere. I think it is a nice idea if you have a well behaved cat - perhaps up to two. But this was not a good investment with four cats. Even though I cleaned them out every day - they would like one more than the other. It was too much for the boxes. They are both now in the dumpster. I have bought three inexpensive large cat boxes with lids (I now have three cats). I am hoping they will be a success.
1,As good as what it is supposed to clean,"This is junk! Even filled only as much as recommended, the machine kept on getting stuck, and repeatedly attempted to clean out the waste. The noise drove me nuts. Frequently, it didn't make it to the holding bin, instead it balanced just before the holding tray. And the teeth were always getting gunked up. I threw it away!"
1,This is a bad product,"I sent the product back. I received the product and it did not work right out of the box. I called customer service and they had me try some strange process to ""reset"" the device. After repeated attempts, I gave up and sent it back. Additionally, the product is cheap plastic and not sturdy at all."
1,Exciting product needs major improvements,"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers. The cats loved it and so did I, for the first 6 hours. The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake, caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours. I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier. Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked. This is true! C'mon you engineers. This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on. Great idea but a real mess to clean up. It is getting returned tomorrow. :("
1,Custom made for a landfill near you...,"Not worth even incidental consideration. I've had two,and they both conked out after two months use. I consider them a complete waste of my hard-earned money. Don't do like I did...heed the reviews. Seek quality elsewhere...you won't find it here."
1,Poor Performance,"What a mess. Litter just gets everywhere...it gets stuck in the back, up on the sides and falls underneath the entire unit in various places. You need to run it frequently and it doesn't always get all the clumps. The containers for the clumps are flimsy at best.I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to sit by it all the time moving debris away from the back and sides."
2,Needs improvement,"I might be reviewing an older product. But it looks just like the three I used to have.1. The box doesn't scrape the bottom of the pan like a handheld scooper. So, the bottom will get covered with a sticky mush that basically stays there forever. And as the mush makes it's way to the the poop container, eventually the rake will get stuck and no longer push the poop into the bin.2. The poop bin is difficult to change, and you have to wear gloves unless you want to touch you-know-what.3. The pan is extremely difficult to clean. They say it's removable, so this may be a newer model. But I know on mine, the tray was part of the unit, and you'd have to carry the whole dirty thing somewhere to clean it. And you wouldn't want to use water because of its electrical components.4. The bins are expensive and fragile. So, if you plan on re-using the bins (like I did), they will crack with repeated removal, because they aren't ideally designed to be removed and replaced."
5,Worth the $ if you hate cleaning cat poop,"We bought the LM900 after purchasing an older refurbished model that died after a few months. DON'T BUY A REFURBISHED MODEL, there is no warrenty.We have two cats (not yet a year old), and they aclimated quite well to the litter maid. One of the cats has a life time disorder of inflammetory bowel disease, which means diarreah if he doesn't get his medicine every day. Beleive you me, the Litter Maid was the answer to our prayers as opposed to cleaning liquid poop clumps EVERY DAY. Sure, you have to scrape the bottom of the pan every few days because the rake doesn't scrape all the way to the bottom, and sometimes the rake gets gummed up and you have to scrape it off every once and while, but it sure beats scooping poop!"
4,GREAT INVESTMENT,"we love our litter maid !!! at first we had problems with it because we were using the wrong litter but since we started using the right one we have no problems with it , even the smell is gone ."
5,Fantastic product for busy owners,"I have to say this is one of the best products we have ever bought for our cats. They love the fact that every time they get in the litter it's clean, and with everyone in household being out at least 12 hours a day week days, it save us coming home to the horrible job of scooping poop. Do I think the replacement recepticles are over priced, yes, but are they worth the investment, also yes. We love our cats, and now we love them more because we are not dreading coming home to a full cat litter tray.This product is also highly useful for those people that have neighbours come and look after there cats while you are away. Our Neighbour loved the fact that she didn't have scoop out the cat poop!While I think this can be a little pricey, it is well worth the investment."
2,Think of this as a bad $15/month litter box cleaning service,"You'll spend $170 for this unit and after about a year it will be so run down that you'll have to buy another one. I've been through three of these in the past three years, and I'm getting really tired of having to replace them. The unit starts off fairly strong, but within a few months the motor doesn't seem to be as strong and the rake is getting jammed as it can't make its way through the litter to scoop it into the container. Also, if I put too much litter into the box (ie. up to the line printed on the side of the machine) it guarantees that the machine will get jammed. It's a great idea, but they need to put a stronger motor in."
1,this is JUNK get a LITTER-ROBOT instead,"when i got it i loved it for about 3 days. then it began clogging up and getting disgustingly dirty. NO ONE i've ever met, and i do animal rescue work, has ever kept this and used it. want to get one that really works? go to http://litter-robot.com/ and check out the message board at http://www.litterbox-central.com this was a great resource for me. i was obsessed with fining a solution to the litterbox oder and time it took. litter robot has been a great product for me...for now nearly a year and on the litterbox central forum you can see testimonials from other users who are happy for longer. 3 weeks for this crummy littermaid or a 18mth warrenty and many happy users with the LITTER-ROBOT"
1,the old litter box doesn't throw cat [droppings] at me...,"This product is an incredible waste of money, at least for a single-cat household. The construction is shoddy, the components are cheap, and the design of the litter receptacle clips can cause a full one to snap suddenly out of place while removing it, which can create a much bigger mess than the scoop ever did. I'll try lining the receptacles with plastic bags as one reviewer suggested... Also, I had to scrape litter-and-urine cement off the bottom of the old box, with the Littermaid I get to scrape it off the rake as well. Yaaay. And you'd better wear goggles if that rake ever gets stuck with the motor grinding away...I don't know what kind of toxoplasmosis you can get when it flings a chunk of cat litter in your eye, but I'll know soon."
2,a good idea but a bad product,I like everyone else HATE cleaning cat box I thought a littermaid would solve all my problems. I purchased one brought it home and fell in love with it. Untill 2 months later the motor burned out. I returned it to the store and exchanged it brought the new one home and two hours later this motor burned out. I am in the process of dealing with customer support. They said they would send us a new one....well see how long the new one lasts. I think this is a poorely made product and I am starting to regret my 199.00 dollar purchase.
2,Broke after 6 months,It's noisy. littermaid should use a quieter motor. Worked well for 6 months and the motor stopped working. It's also hard to clean.
2,My Littermaid Pooped Out,"Bought this four months ago and really really wanted it to work out. I'd heard of other littermaids dying after several months and I crossed my fingers that this wouldn't happen to mine because the convenience of this contraption is hard to pass up. Unfortunately, it appears that my littermaid is officially dead and I'm annoyed that I'll have to return it and wait X months for a replacement. I loved it while it worked (though it did involve some scraping and cleaning here and there), but now that it won't turn on, its just an overpriced piece of plastic."
1,Droppings keep getting caught in rake ...,"This product works good, except for the obnoxious fact that my cat's feces frequently gets caught in the rake because it only sits there for 10 mins, which as other users have stated is not long enough to allow the litter to clump. In the end, I've found it to be more of a a big pain in the neck to be removing cat droppings from the rank then to just scoop it out by hand.Those of you that like the automatic feature though, check out the Litter Robot as an alternative. I haven't used it yet, but it looks to be a far superior product, although it is more expensive."
2,"A good idea, but doesn't work well","I tried one of these for a few months. It never worked as good as I'd hope. It had trouble scooping up urine even when using the best brand of clumping litter. Plus, after about six months, the motor broke. Save your money."
5,Best Box,"I wouldn't have Cats if there were not a product that worked as well as this auto cat litter box. Although I've had three in 8 years,if it breaks just call Litter Maid and they should replace the first one. Wonderful product !!!!"
5,Works great!,"I looked at a lot of automatic litter boxes before I decided on the LitterMaid LM900 Mega Self-Cleaning Litter Box. I read all of the reviews and decided on this model (there are other models that don't seem to work very well, so make sure you get the LM900). It performs exactly as it's supposed to.I have two kittens and they took to it right away. I'm very pleased with this product. As long as you use the premium clumping litter (I use Fresh Step), this unit works great. With two kittens, I need to change (or empty) the container about every 3 days. I add extra litter about every 2 weeks. If you want to save money, you don't have to replace the containers, you can just empty them. I also like the idea that it can run on batteries, so if the power is out, you can still get the benefits of the self-cleaning!"
2,Littermaid Pros & Cons,"The littermaid LM900 does an ok job of scooping the litter however the product is not terribly well made, the motor is rather weak, and the metal rake sometimes get stuck.You can expect to have to replace it every year or two. I'm on my third one, and although my expectations of any product are that it should hold up far better than this, I am willing to accept the trade-off of high priced/low value versus bending over and scooping cat litter. Perhaps the manufacturer is betting on just that. New and improved does not always mean better. The prior model with a longer plastic rake actually worked much better and lasted longer. It is almost as if the manufacturer purposely lowered the quality standard of the product. Other similar products do not seem any better. It would be nice to see someone take this concept into a great product and give these guys some competition."
1,Don't waste your money!,I have spent more money on litter boxes than clothes. I have had three Littermaid litter boxes and they all ceased working correctly within a few months. One of them never worked right from day one. I had to manually turn it on after the cats used them. They are difficult to clean and the motors are not adequate for the job they are supposed to do. I recently spent more money on a Scoop Free automatic litter box and so far it has been terrific!
3,I honestly don't know what to think anymore,My first unit broke after 6 months than littermaid charges you $10.00 for a new one which broke after 1 month so another $10.00 for another and it broke in one month so they charged me $5.00 for the last one that broke about 6 months later. Well I have 4 broken units sitting in my garage.....or so I thought. I ordered a mega unit last night so i figured i would check these units to see what i could salvage from them. Surprisingly 2 of the 4 units are working again!!! so now i have 3 working littermaids. When yours stops working all of a sudden i suggest unpluging and letting them sit for a while before assuming they are dead like i did.I will see how things go and update this post accordingly.
2,Waste of Money,"I bought this litter box 7 months ago and it quit working this morning. For $100+ bucks it should last longer 7 months!!! Before it broke, it always seemed to leak a lot of litter out of the bottom and it didn't have enough power to clean urine spots. It would get stuck and you would have to clean it manually anyway. It's kinda loud and feces stick to the plastic prongs after it's done cleaning and continue to stink until you unattach it and wash it. It's gross. All that aside Im most ticked off that it broke (not sure if the motor gave out or what) after only 7 months. Talk about a rip off!"
1,Doesn't work with green tea cat litter,"The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it won't work with my, and my cat's, favorite litter. Yes it's a clumping litter. Also the tongs on the rake are very wide. This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin (even with the smallest clumping litter I could find). It wastes a LOT of litter, pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it's path into the bin... more of a shovel, than a rake IMO. In order to not waste more litter than is used, I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter.... far more of a hassle than useful.I would not repurchase this item, nor would I recommend it to a friend.... an enemy.... maybe."
4,"Works fine, durable.","I've had this litter box for 1.5 years and it sill works great. It is a bit noisy, but both you and the cats get used to it. I have 2 cats and one initially did not like this litter box, likely because of the noise.She would not use this liter box, no matter what. She then decided to start using after we moved to a new home. Cats, you can never understand them. This is very practical, as you can go out of town for a few days and not need to worry about the litter box. I recommend this product."
4,3 cats,i have had good luck with these products-the elite does not clear as well. i have had littermaid boxes stop working before but i was able to get it replaced without too much trouble. one stopped working and the company was able to tell me how to fix it over the phone. make sure you resister the product to cover warrenty
2,Litter Maid works just fine.,Works just fine but no longer in use. It Crapped out after about six months.
3,"It works, but...","The rake is difficult to clean. If your cat has hard little turds, buy it. If the fecal matter that you have to deal with is soft or runny, its easier to scoop."
1,Poor Product - do not buy it!!!,"They call this a self cleaning litter box? Maybe its because you have to clean it yourself!! The forks constantly get caked up with wet litter, the motor screams like its moving cement, and the box needs constant cleaning. This leads to more time maintaining the box and arguments with my wife. Spend the money on a good dinner and scoop the poop manually."
2,Defective,The product is defective in that at the end of a cleaning cycle the collection container cover will not close.
1,Cat Is Too Darn Big,"20+ lb. tabby. His regular pan-type boxes from the supermarket are larger than the litter area of the LM900 (14"" x 16"" x 8""). He used it once and never went back... just doesn't fit. And cleaning the teeth of the cleaning the rake is a pain."
1,Just think of it as a rental,"If you've got enough money just hope to get 4 or 5 months, on average, out of each one and then buy a new one.I don't have time to try to call their help line again and not even reach someone. All the technicians would do, I'm sure, is just read off a faq of things to try when the thing starts to run continuously. It would be cheaper for the company to post that faq on the web, which they don't seem to do because, well these are clearly not quality people behind this company.Waiting for someone smarter to put them out of business. Then these guys can move on to their next con."
1,Just another mess,"This is not a solution but an expensive messy alternative to a cheap messy litter box. All cats, esp. older ones, have days when their poop is messy and the rake on this machine gets covered with the stuff. Cleaning the rake is worse than dumping any every day litter box. If the box itself needs to be cleaned, it is heavy and hard to handle. If a cat has bad aim, there are no sides (as in covered litter boxes) to keep it from scattering, spraying or missing the box. The custom litter and liners are much more expensive and have to be bought from only certain dealers. Also, if a cat has problems (as in older cats) with their urine being strong smelling, it does nothing to help that situation as only clumps are scooped into the bag. Nothing about cleaning cat litter is fun but cleaning a covered type litter box regularly is a easier, less expensive and less steps than this device. I see it as a gadget for gadget people not a solution for the cat litter disposal issue."
1,Large & Small models are awful!,"I have both the large & small models. The small one works better than the large. Neither work well and it is almost easier to go back to a manual box. Their lack of performance have caused me to look again for another self cleaning litter box. The two are messy and mut be emptied every 2 days. The larger one does not even get its ""load"" into the tray. Do not buy either one!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"We had a Litter Maid cat box several years ago and we loved it. They have ""improved"" their product and ruined it in my opinion. The rake gets clogged and litter sticks all over the place and in the tracks no matter what level of litter you use. We tried every type of litter available, including the ridiculously expensive litter that Litter Maid sells. We spent more time cleaning this worthless litter box than we would have in scooping out regular litter. We contacted the manufacturer, but they won't stand behind their product and we could not return it to the store because we did not have the original box, although we did have the receipt. After a couple of months we threw it out in the garbage. I won't waste my money on any other product Liter Maid sells. Save yourself this frustration and find another brand. I would not have given this item even one star, but one star is the lowest rating."
1,More mess and fuss,"At first this automated litter box seemed to be the real deal. First impressions can be disceiving. If you have a larger cat, say 10 lbs or more, then this machine has a laborsome time getting the job done. The rake sticks and seldom cleans it's self much less the box and I have tried every brand of premium litter on the market with the same results. It was not worth the $100 plus price tag. It may work fine for small cats, but it you have a large cat, forget it, you'll have more cleaning to do than with a conventional litter box."
1,cheap product,"My first LM900 was sturdy and reliable. I had it for nine years and never experienced any mechanincal problems. When it finally broke I immediately ordered another one without hesitation. Unfortunately, when I took it out of the box I could tell the product was poorly made. Everything from the litter box to the scoop appeared to be cheap. When I plugged it in the rake went back and forth constantly. This continued to be a problem so I sent it back and got a refund."
2,Neither of mine worked for long!,"When I bought my first LitterMaid box, I thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping! Hooray! It worked so well for my four cats that a few months later, I bought a second one. Unfortunately, the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks (and I'd thrown the receipt away, so I couldn't get my money back). Soon after that, the original box quit working, too. So, within about 6 months, I spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned.After researching better and more reliable options, I've settled on the Omega Paw box that you roll to clean. I now have three of them -- no electric parts to break, and, actually, less mess than the LitterMaid."
2,Have owned three; probably won't buy a fourth,"I want to like this device, I really do. When it works, it's a dream come true for those (like me) who hate to clean litter boxes. Within my experience, however, ""when it works"" is a serious issue. All three of the LitterMaid boxes I've owned (one regular, two Mega) have broken down beyond any hope of field repair within a couple of months after the warranty expired. Customer service is next to useless for any significant problem; expect a lecture on selecting the proper litter no matter what you're calling about. Also, nobody I've talked to had any idea of how to order parts beyond a replacement comb. The bottom line is that these things are just too expensive to factory-repair or replace every 12-14 months, and I'm not going to do so a third time. If they extend the warranty to three years or so, I'll reconsider."
2,"For the love of God, no","Nobody enjoys the revolting task of scooping the litter box. The promise of a product that will free us from this disgusting chore is very, very tempting. But the LitterMaid is not the solution.I've owned two. They clog. The rake gets stuck. The cord gets covered in waste. They're hard to clean. They dump dirty litter on your floor. The waste receptacles are proprietary and (relatively) expensive.Spend the extra money and buy a Litter Robot. Google it if you need to know where. It's three times the price, but it's worth every penny to get an automatic litterbox that actually works."
1,Don't Buy Save Money and Time and Buy Throw Away Litter,"I bought this litter box on the advice of family and as soon as my cat first used it I knew it was going to be a hassle, the litter sticks to the comb and it is a hassle to clean them I had to use Qtips to get them clean... and then a year after purchasing it the combs stopped working... I called litter maid and they said it wasn't covered because my year warranty had expired a month earlier my husband who has a electronic and engineering degree tried to fix it but some of the parts would have been to expensive to buy so we ended up having to throw it away. Save Your Money and Buy Throw Away Litter and a $2.00 Litter Tray!"
1,Save your money,The rake is aweful. It does not remove as the instructions state and cat feces gets caught in it. I have bought plastic gloves to try to clean the rake to no avail. Save your money-I have only had mine for 3 weeks and I wish i had never bought it!
1,Good Idea - BAD CHEAP PRODUCT,"Had the original littermaid box for 2 years.After it broke, I had the bright idea to get 1 for each of my 5 cats. I spent over $1000 on them. Only one still works.I have replaced each of the 4 others 3 times each. They only last for approximately 1 month, then the rake stops in the 'dump' position. The company is not good about replacing them. So now I have conventional boxes. Too bad! When the Littermaid works it is very helpful...but the company has obviously skimped on production and is now selling a very lousy product. Don't waste your money or time. Look for another company to make a much more reliable product. I am!"
1,No parts available for repair!! Bad company policy!,I had this for a few years and it worked okay but it would get stuck in the rake. My biggest problem with this product is Littermaid does not offer repair parts after the first year once your warranty is up. I find this unacceptable and they are just money grabbing up front on a cheaply built product and expect you to buy a new one after it breaks. Are people so uneducated that they will continue to support this company with their hard earned money!!! DON'T DO IT!!!
4,an old owner,"I didn't see any recent reviews. Just wanted to add my 2 cents. Our cat died 5 years ago after using Littermaid for 4 years. I got it out of storage for my daughter in October of this year and put it on the deck to clean off cobwebs. Forgot it! It stayed out for 5"" snowfall, rain and dropping leaves. Remembered it was there, wiped it off, brought it inside, let it dry off and presto! It still works! Congratulations Littermaid!( Suggestion: My cat wouldn't use the ramp so I threw it away. I used grocery shopping bags to line the plastic container so I just lifted out the bag to empty the ""clumps"".)"
2,Great Idea to bad it's junk,"We've owned the LitterMaid LM580 for a month before it broke. After doing a little searching on the net it seems that they break so much that some guy sells a repair manual that he wrote himself.I'm handy with tools so I took it apart and found a short in the wiring. The thing is just a bunch of plastic with a little motor and a few sensors. It's not worth the $100 plus price tag. What your paying for is the conveniences. I would say $40 would be a more reasonable price. The litter trays only lasted 2-3 days with one cat, and they seem kinda pricey if you have to be replacing them constantly.I gave it 2 stars because it broke after a month although the idea of a self cleaning litter box get 5 stars.We do like it's convenience but right now I'm looking for a web site that sells repair parts because I'm sure I'll be taking it apart again."
2,Self Claeaning Litter Box,I purchased the LitterMaid LM 9000 Mega Self Cleaning Litter Box in May 2010 and already the sensor quit working. That was an awful expense for 8 month use. Now I have to clean it manually
1,A step backward,"I bought this version because the original version was no longer available. My original box worked great for 6 years until the cable broke (and I was unable or unwilling to fix it). This new ""improved"" version is flimsy, it scoops twice as much litter into the tray as the previous model so you end up buying twice as much litter, the scoop is as likely to spill litter off the sides as it is to get it into the tray, no matter how I tried to snug the tray under the lip of the box (as directed) there would still be a pile of litter that had fallen between the box and the tray, and the interior of the box is smaller than the original - not great for a large cat. And why on Earth does a cat need a digital clock?! I have since unplugged the unit and now have a really expensive litter box that I clean the old fashion way every day (which was as often as I had to change it anyway due to the quantity of litter scooped up.) Unhappy? You betcha!"
1,Do not buy - unreliable and replacement bins are a rip off!!!,"I would highly discourage anyone from buying this litter box. We have one cat in our household and have replaced this unit twice in the last 12 months. Not only is the litter box unreliable (gets jammed alot), it stinks (the traditional little box smell is still there), but the replacement containers are like $30 for 12... Thats alot of money for cheap plastic containers if you ask me. Spend a little more up front and save yourself the headache and maintainence costs.. Check out the Litter Robot.. we just bought one and it is awesome.. it uses regualr garbage bags for the litter, does not smell (has an enclosed area for the litter that seals the dirty litter in), and there is no need to buy the $35 ""tent"" this unit requires to keep the cat from kicking litter out. Or you can waste monty on this unit and I will see your negative review in about 6 months when it breaks... Cheers"
1,Save Your Money!,"On my third unit. If your cat is like mine and decides to push all the litter to one section of the box on occasion after using it, then the rakes will not be able to push the waste into the receptacle, which are $16 for a pack of 15. Then, you are suppose to fill the box with litter up to the red line, but if you do that, the rakes have trouble going over the litter. And now for the icing on the cake. On this latest unit, the hatch to the receptacle doesn't close after some, not all the waste is deposited. So guess what, if I'm out for the day, I come home to a stench because the lid has been open for hours. Three strikes, and now they are out!"
1,Do not waste your money!,"These litter boxes only last as long as the warrenty. After one year you will need to buy a new one. We now have 5 here that we have to clean the old fashioned way. With a scoop. They no longer do anything but hold litter. A total of around 800.00 for a litter box we still have to scoop, just like the 5.00 boxes. I e-mailed the company once with the question as to why they only last one year? Never had a reply. I have talked to people and all they tell you to do is keep resetting them. Thats had to do when they do not even come on when plugged in. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. THEY DO NOT WORK MORE THAN ONE YEAR!!!!"
1,Same problems as always...,"This is the third time (stupid me) that I purchased a LitterMaid. In the past, they would work for awhile but ultimately would develop a problem where they would not stop raking. This one did it out of the box. I had reviewed other products such at the Robotic litter box...it seems very expensive, but given the problems I have had, the shipping returns, etc...I think I have been penny wise but pound foolish. I am returning this item, will spend the extra money to buy a quality and working product and be done with this."
4,Works better than the rest!,I Have tried the newer model and It does not work AT ALL! This works a lot better. The collection box is rather difficult to remove when it is full. And the lid falls off the holder. But this one is the best one yet!
4,LitterMaid Litter Box,This was a replacement of a previous one that had broken. Only complaint is this is our third one in 4 years. They are grwat when they work.
3,Still needs improvement,"It's great not having to scoop poop all the time. I have two cats, one of which seems to like the area closest to the rake to do her business. Unfortunately, this causes the rake to pierce the clump where it gets stuck after dragging it thru the litter. The manufacturer should have a second mechanism on the rake that comes down to push stuck clumps off the tines. It's possible to tap on the rake to loosen the clumps if you're able to catch the rake while it's dropping the litter. You can also turn it off while the rake is paused over the disposal container and push off any stuck clumps with a stick or something sturdy. I bought this so my pregnant daughter could care for my cats while I was on vacation, but it requires more attention than it should for an automated cleaner. The price has gone up considerably on Amazon since I bought it, so it seems I got a great deal; but there's still room for improvement."
1,we gave up,"We purchased our first Littermaid in 2000. We loved it. After 10 years and 5 decreasingly satisfactory models, today we gave up. If Littermaid would just return to their original product, we'd buy it again in a flash. As it is now, it's easier to deal with an old-fashioned litterbox. Even messes on the floor are easier to deal with."
1,Never again,"I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years. NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid. This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years, but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off. The cord finally snapped on Monday. Not only the short lifespan considering the price, but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan. No matter what litter brand I tried, it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan, would stick to the rake, and eventually cause the machine to cut off.Just purchased an Omega Paws, which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.Good idea, very poor longterm performance."
3,Better than the LitterMaid Elite,This is our 3rd LitterMaid. It's far from perfect but way better than the Elite model. The LitterMaid Elite was very poor design at a higher price. The major design flaw was the rake system that kept on breaking. Also It would stop working from cat litter that constantly clogged the micro switch. Go with the LiterMaid LM900. I got it because my mom is arthritic and it's difficult for her to scoop. Otherwise I wouldn't get one for my mom. Nothing beats hand scooping. Expect your Littermaid to last only 2 years.
4,So far so good..........,"I bought this about two weeks ago and so far so good. Like many other users, I researched and read all the reviews before making the purchase on the littermaid. Every product I searched out there, users either liked it or hated it. I took a chance and I'm glad I did. At first I wasn't impressed on the overall quality of the machine. It's plastic and rather cheap looking. I don't use the filters, so don't buy them. They don't stick very well and they kept coming off. To save on reordering receptables, I use plastic grocery bags to easily discard the waste. I also use Tidy Cat litter and it works fine. I was worried that my cat wouldn't use the machine, but as soon as I turned it on, he used it right away. Like I said, so far so good...."
4,When it works its great but......,When it works its great....but one did not work at all.....luckily amazon has a great returns dept and policy
3,"big expense, doesn't last","We have 2 cats. We are on our 3rd(!)mega litter box, (and our last!) It is a great idea, works great at first, but the major problem is it is not waterproof (or should I say fluid-proof.) My cats are normal-sized female cats, spayed, but they cannot keep their pee in the litter area. Pee routinely gets on the motor area, which is not protected at all from moisture. The motor then quits. As other posters have mentioned, I have taken apart the fixtures multiple times to clean them out. Sometimes I'm successful in getting them to work again, sometimes not. I'M DONE! We have wasted over $450!! on these ""free"" cats, it pains me to say. Lesson hard-learned. I love our cats, they can stay, but the stupid, way-too-expensive ""automatic"" litter box is out! Great idea, poor execution."
2,Not worth the money,"I have owned 2 of these boxes. The first lasted for about 2 years when the motor died in it. The second one I had barely had for a year (one month out of warranty) and the little cable that communicates with the motor went out. When you spend this kind of money on a product you should get more than a few years out of it. I have 2 cats and have used the high quality clumping litter with it. When it did work, it worked fairly well other than the plastic rake tends to get very ""mucked"" up and is very hard to keep clean. You really need the privacy tent to keep all the kitty litter contained that your cats may throw out. They don't like the rake and if it scares them they will face it when they cover their tracks kicking a lot of litter out of the box. I think I'll try the Petmate Purrforma next!"
1,What did they do to the new models?,"I bought my first Littermaid a long time ago and it worked well for almost ten years. When it finally broke I didn't have a second thought about buying a new one because it was so convenient to have. I bought the first replacement and it died within a month. I got a replacement for that and within a couple of months it stopped working automatically, meaning it won't shut off by itself. I am completely dissatisfied with this machine. I see it is made in China. I wonder if the company is now making its product cheaper. Something certainly has changed because it is no longer a useful piece of equipment. I wouldn't recommend it unless there is indication the company is taking more interest in quality control. Obviously its possible to make one of these machines that works because in the early days of the company they built one that lasted."
1,Get a Litter Robot instead,"Get a Litter Robot instead. Costs more, but you get what you pay for. www.litter-robot.com. Also go here for reviews: http://www.litterbox-central.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3"
1,A waste of time and money,"It's time to kiss $200 (and Litter Maid) goodbye.We bought one and it seemed to do the job so after a week we bought a second one. BIG MISTAKE.One machine broke and the rake just flopped around and couldn't scoop. We were able to get a replacement - but it is still in the carton - because the other litter box is always jamming. And they sent the wrong model (a cheaper one).One of our three cats tends to pee on one side of the box and the clump is getting stuck to the bottom of the pan. We can only imagine that the urine goes down the side of the pan, under the litter, and then clumps and sticks - constantly. We tried EVERY recommendation in reviews to try and stop the sticking.I will give the replacement box away and throw away the used one. Maybe the next owner's cat will pee right in the middle.It's back to the old-fangled poop and scoop box."
5,Happy with it for 2 cats for 4 years,"I had a visiter to my home say, after two days, ""I didn't realize you had cats!"" - and the guest bed is in the room next to the litterbox. Having waste scooped into a covered container shortly after it is deposited makes a huge difference in how the smell from a litterbox affects your home. That alone is worth the price.The box is not labor free - you need to clean it occasionally - but I find that it is much, much less work than a standard cat box.I've had mine for over four years, and have had no mechanical problems with it."
2,petowner,Littermaid is a great product we have used one for over ten years. It does have its quirks but for the most part it works very well.The one we ordered from amazon did not include the power pack which is very important to have.
1,Rotten product,"First off, it seems that someone is spamming the reviews. Each of these glowing reviewers has never reviewed anything else on Amazon. And when a bad review is posted you'll see several days worth of great reviews to push off the bad ones. [edit: Note the new ""Amazon verified purchase"" label! Beware of the glowing review from people who have not purchased this item.]Let me say, this is the biggest pile of junk you'll ever waste you're money on. Even with high quality clumping litter it did not work. The rake would get clogged. The receptacle wouldn't close. Litter stuck all over the place and in the tracks even though we were well below the ""fill line."" We spent more time cleaning this piece of junk than a regular litter box. In less than a month we threw it out in the garbage.Do not waste your time and money on this product. Stick with the regular litter, you'll be glad you did."
2,Not worth the effort,"While the obvious benefit of this product is that you do not have to remove the litter for a few days (compared with every or every other day), the effort involved in keeping this product working is not remotely worth it. The rake (part that gets sifts through the litter) constantly gets clumpy regardless of whether you use the recommended kitty litter or not. Refilling the machine with litter is also difficult seeing as it requires a very specific amount to function. Any more than that amount results in your rake being unable to sift through the litter and making failed effort after failed effort."
3,Great litterbox unless you have multiple cats,This is the second Littermaid automatic I've owned. The first one broke b/c my last cat liked to jump in and out of the box to make the comb go back and forth so the motor finally burnt out. This second one does okay but struggles with 2 large cats. Even with great clumping litter it still gets jammed and has trouble scooping up all of the urine clumps. Overall though it's better than scooping a box every day.
1,A nightmare to clean!,"This item works fine until it gets crudded up with dried on poop and litter. It's a nightmare to clean, and my box went dead after 6 months. I wrote to the company TWICE and got no response at all! I would advise against buying this product. It takes less time to rake out a litter box 1-2 times a day, than to clean the mess that this box creates! And yes, I did use the recommended litter -- it made no difference!!"
3,Littermaid,"This is my second Littermaid. I have multiple cats and this box has been a life saver. Unfortunately, I just bought this box on 11/7 and it is already broken. I would give the Littermaid 4 stars for ease of usse, but could only truly rate at 3 since reliability seems to be an issue. My first Littermaid lasted almost a year and then the rake stuck in the forward position and would not move again. Now my second one has just done the same thing after 2 months. Hopefully, warranty will cover it."
1,Piece of Poop,I wish this thing would clean itself up and throw itself in the trash. That is where it belongs.
1,No crap needed; this product is one.,"I bought this for our one cat thinking it would make the kitty box maintenance and bit easier and, cut down on the smell some. After about two months, it just stopped working. I called the company and they made me contact Amazon.com first to try and get a replacement. They wouldn't replace it, so I had to send the battery cover and power cord back to the company before they would send me a new one. After about two months of using the new one, it stopped working too. Don't bother with this."
2,Where is the power pac?,"We purchased the Litter Maid for my wife's grandmother and her two cats because my wife loves the connivance of ours. All well and good, the package came in a very quick time with no damage to the box.GramMa got it for Christmas and was not as nearly as excited as Gramps at the thought of modernizing the cats. When we cam to visit this week we come to find Gramps has been using batteries (which by the way do not last very long with now 3 cats). We contacted the factory thru the phone number in the box to find it disconnected. I then went to radio shack and bought them a universal adapter to power the unit.Works great but very disappointed in the customer service or the lack of...."
1,HORRIBLE,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I had this for all of six months with my two cats. It was impossible to keep clean. Litter was everywhere, it didn't matter that I had the ramp. It also scared my normally sedate and happy cat because of the unusual configuration. I used the litter they recommended and it stuck everywhere! Between the tines, on the sides and to the bottom of the pan! I could never get it clean and I ended up dumping it every week and taking to cleaning it outside. After six months of washing it down with water and pine-sol that I needed to use to get rid of the embedded urine smell, it burned out the motor. It's easier to keep a normal litter box clean with liners, and just dump the litter ever few days. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,"A problem, not a solution.","First off, the thing looks like one of those D-Day landing boats. Really good for the decor of any kitchen and handy if your cat plans on invading Normandy any time soon. Second, the sensors seem to have a hard time distinguishing between ""cat"" and ""cat poo."" My cat has been raked over several times and, in one frightening incident, spent three days pinned against the box's plastic bulkhead.It's a good thing I never liked that cat much anyway. B+."
1,Still Undecisive,You guys are so funny. I could not stop laughing. I'm still confused if I should purchase this electric litterbox gizmo. I read a split 50/50 review about it. Will continue asking people.
3,"Works as described, but ...","While the litter box does work as advertised, there is one small problem. The lid for the disposable tray does not want to close - almost every time we check the box, the lid is standing at least partially open. It doesn't affect the working of the box and, since the box is not in an area of the house that is open, it's not offensive. However, for the price, I'd expect the lid to close. I've been using various Littermaid boxes for the past 6 years or so and the first model is still the best, as far as I'm concerned."
5,My Cat Won't Poo without This!,"My cat has been using a litter maid for several years. I have two cats and my persian has been using it since he was a baby. He just doesnt like stepping in poo to go poo! The sensor works within usually a minute after he steps out of it and scoops it into its own container. VERY happy with this product, dont know what I would do without it!!!"
3,This is my 4th littermaid,As I said this is my 4th box. So that tells you they don't last very long. But once you start using you can't stop because it's so easy. I only have one cat and the box normally lasts about 1 1/2 years. So just know that going in. Hoping this one lasts longer as its' a new style
2,What happened? Quality isn't what it used to be.,"This is the third Littermaid I've purchased. I've been very pleased with the first two cat boxes but this one is not what I expected. Littermaid has changed the quality of the recepticles boxes. The box will not stay in place thus kitty litter and waste go everywhere. The recepticle tops are horrible. I have to TAPE the cheapo lid to my cat box. I do re-use my boxes but I did that before with my two previous cat boxes and did not have a problem. The quality of this new cat box is not as good as before. Next time I have to purchase a cat box, it will not be Littermaid. I'm ready to try something else."
2,Doesn't Last,"I bought this in late June of 2009 and it gave out already. I had a liitermaid previously and had to get a replacement within 1 month. It gave out within a year and a half, so I decided to get the ""Mega"" box, since we have more than one cat using it.Customer service is a waste. I called ""Littermaid"" and their response was, ""They should last about a year, some less and some more."" Not for that kind of money!Please think about it before you might want to invest.I'm not the kind of person who writes many reviews, but this is ridiculous."
2,Not for skittish kitties,"I paid way too much to find out that the motor makes a lot of noise when cleaning the box. My cat was scared of it even though the timing was set to delay the cleaning. The box takes up a lot of room and has to be plugged in so placement is limited. I also did not like that the soiled litter would stick to the bottom, break into small pieces that the comb would not catch, and often missed the receptacle. I ended up having to clean it out manually to fix the mess left behind. I would rather just scoop it the first time myself and save the hassle....and money. I gave mine to a friend and she eventually had the same complaints about the cleanliness. Her cats used it just fine without fear."
1,Horrible product,"We bought the LitterMaid Self_Cleaning litter box and truly hoped it would eliminate the need for us to hand scoop litter. That's the whole purpose of the product right? Well, the LitterMaid only grabs some of the litter, while leaving a lot it for us to hand scoop out. I'm in the process of considering an alternative that is more reliable. Avoid this product!!!"
2,The sometime-self-cleaning litter Box,"Our littermaid worked fine for a while, as long as our cat's body produced clumpable waste. Then after 3 months the motor stopped working altogether."
2,Doesn't work half the time,"This litter box is a good idea, but the bugs still need to be worked out. The litter sticks to the box most of the time, which prevents the rake from cleaning the box. In the end, most of the time I have to still clean out the litter by hand, completely defeating the purpose of even having the thing. In addition, the motor is really loud, and when it encounters an obstacle (i.e. clumped up litter sticking to the box) it makes three passes before finally shutting down and blinking the light that shows me that the box has yet again failed to perform. I even have to shut off the box at night. Otherwise I'll be woken up by the sound of the rake going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Better to wait for the next model, which hopefully will be more advanced than this one."
1,SELF CLEANING LITTER BOX,THIS PRODUCT WAS BROKEN BY THE 2ND DAY. THE MOTOR IS SO UNDERSIZED THAT IT CAN'T DO THE JOB. THE GEARS ARE PLASTIC AND BECAME STRIPPED OUT. I WANT MY MONEY BACK
1,Very Disappointed. Wait for Better Technology,"I bought the Littermaid Plus for our two cats. In less than a month, I have had almost daily problems. This thing requires daily maintenance and nursing--the load gets too heavy for the motor, or the tines get out of alignment (don't stand over it when that happens--it flicks dirty cat litter right in your face). I've seen another automatic box with metal tines (brand?), which I think would be an improvement. My Littermaid is now dead. A very expensive box that I clean manually. Littermaid has agreed to replace it (they wanted me to pay freight until I objected!!) but I have zero confidence it will be better."
1,Horriable,This was a terrible purchase. I should have done my research first. The comb does not have enough power to actually scrap the litter into the waste thing. It gets stuck and then gives up and just does nothing. Now the great thing is where I bought it. I bought mine from pet smart and they happily took it back and I was able to get a full refund. I would have taken store credit but I wanted to do more research before I bought another self cleaning litter box.
4,Very pleased with it,"Don't understand the problems others have with this item. As long as you remember to put additional litter into the box, it works fine. I had one for several years before it died. I keep one upstairs and one down for my 3 cats. As for the sound, I sleep through it even though I'm a light sleeper. You must use good litter and keep enough in it. Mine clogs once in a while but not often enough to complain about it."
4,Good Product,"This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Both myself and the cats are pleased.The only problems are the plastic trays you have to use and since they can go over the side to get in and out the ramp is useless. The trays are flimsy and if you have multiple cats the trays have to be changed every day or two unless you are able to find a substitute for using the trays.I prefer it over scooping and the cats prefer having their box cleaned after each use rather than having to try to find a clear space in a used box.All three started using it as soon as I set it up. It is a little noisy and the cats would run over to watch it every time it started to clean itself the first couple of weeks.Overall, we are all very happy I made the purchase."
4,no oder kitty litter,"Works great after the cats get over being intimidated by it. Best feature is no oder! Replacing the plastic containers is a bit dicey - I recommend plastic gloves. More cost effective if you can plug it in rather than using batteries, especially with two cats."
5,Littermaid LM900 review,"This is my second Littermaid box. The first one lasted about 5 years. I have 3 cats (2 large, 1 average) and this is the perfect size for them. In addition to changing waste recepticles, it does require a bit of dusting along the tracks to keep things moving, but a small whisk broom works perfectly."
1,It Quit!,I recieved my litter box on January 12th and was thrilled. It was little noisy but hey I could live with that. Today the motor quit. $100 for two months??? Little pricey. I have a call into the company we'll see if it's a hassle to replace it. They have a 1 year warranty.
4,Mostly a good deal,"I have two cats that use this box. Like another reviewer wrote, she likes to go in the same spot, so one side of the disposable tray fills up faster, therefore the lid doesn't shut all the way.Another problem I have with this is the lid to the tray doesn't attach to the unit. There are these little clippy things, but they don't hold the lid AT ALL! I just use tape to hold it in, but it's still irritating.I've had this for about 6 months. It just started making a squeaky sound as the rake is pulled back into the unit, and a couple of times it has continued to run, three or four cycles in a row.Litter is all over the floor. I've tried the tent, but it makes cleaning it more difficult. I would suggest a carpeted room, not one with hardwood floors;)Overall, it keeps the box clean and I do like it very much. I just think for the price, some things should be improved upon."
3,Stopped working,It stopped working not even a year after I purchased it. Spent way to much on it for not even lasting a year.
5,Couldn't live without- neither can they...,"I've had two of these since my cats were babies. They are wonderful! I use tidy cats scoopable litter. Recently the rake broke (6 yes old) and I turned it off until I could get a new one. If the box was soiled, the cats wouldn't go in! They love a clean litter box! This is usually clean always.... No one would EVER guess there are two cats in my home, it cleans itself!"
2,ok but not great,This replaced the same model that I had for 6 years.the new one must have a weaker motor because it cannot push through the piles of litter like the older one.
2,There's got to be something better !,"Had about 6 of these in the last 3 years,apparently they are made to self destruct in about 6-9 months. Unfortunately when they work right they are better than the alternative so I keep replacing them in hopes that one day they will get it right. They are getting better, the last one I bough just died after about a year the only reason I gave it 2 stars."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought one of these litter boxes a year ago, and quickly it became more of a hassle than it was worth. The comb jams more than it works. I found that I was cleaning this box more often than I was cleaning a regular box. The comb would get litter built up in it causing it to try to scoop all the litter into the compartment, causing a jam. The next problem I was having was the litter would get in the gear on the side of the box, causing the comb to jam. The litter box was so noisy that my cat would attack the box, and end up using the nearest plant as her litter box. This product suffers from many design flaws. The ramp broke after the first week. Note: I followed all the directions that came with the litter box, and still went through two of them before throwing this product away, and buying an oversized litter box."
1,More trouble than it is worth,"When I first got LitterMaid Mega I thought it was the best thing in the world...but it didn't take long to realize that it wasn't going to work.For one thing the Mega PAN is bigger but the trays are the same size, so I ended up having to empty everyday anyway. Also if you have a cat that tends to go in the same place like I do, the litter clumps stack up in the tray all in one spot so most days I came home to a lid only half closed on top of a huge pile of litter on one side and none on the other.The 10 minute interval just isn't long enough for the wet stuff to clump so it ends up all over the tines of the rake. Once it starts getting dirty it is a bear to keep clean. I would not buy another one."
1,"The Incubus, or, How a Litterbox Ruined My Life","This is possibly the worst product ever fashioned by human hands. When it does work, which is rarer than the appearance of most astronomical phenomenon, all the tines of the rake serve to do is spear chunks of cat feces and carry them back to the return position, leaving nothing in the waste receptacle. Spending just five minutes scraping it off is enough to make me want to stab myself with one of said tines, that I might become infected with a deadly strain of ecoli, and be permanently freed from this abortion of a product. Please, spend your money elsewhere, and if you already own one, do humanity a favor and destroy it, preferably by incineration."
1,One star is too many!,"If you enjoy scooping out the litter box twice a day then this is product for you! I purchased this box thinking it would free up my time and allow me to travel on weekends...not. Now I come home to a huge mess, usually because the clumps will get jammed under the rake and it likes to lock up in the middle of the pan (which confuses the hell out of my cats)Its loud and very undependable and just plain annoying...hate it!!"
2,"Good product, but not so durable","Bought this in January 2010 and WAS happy with it because it allowed me to have just one litter box for three cats. Upkeep was as described in other reviews, daily sweeping and a sanitary wipedown. It provided more peace of mind when we left the cats in someone else's care for vacations. After 19 months, it is dead! One of the wheels on rake came off, causing the entire rake bar to fall off. As much as we liked it while it worked, it was not worth the money."
2,Not worth the effort,Didn't really save anytime or labor vs the old manual scoop method. It will wake you up at night if it's located near your bedroom. You also have to buy new waste containers or reuse/wash the old stinky ones frequently. The attached rug/ramp does not completely eliminate the cat(s) tracking litter across the floor either. The cat pee along with small amounts of littler gets into the track and has to be cleaned every week or so. The automated rake gets clogged with cat litter and needs to be cleaned out every other day. Not as big as I would have like it to be either. Our cat is about 13 lbs and just barely fit into this. It does automatically rake the litter into a wast container but the maintenance is worse than just doing it manually.
1,Didn't work from the get-go,"I opened the box. Did the minimal assembly AND read the instructions. The auto-scooper kept on running and running and running. It says it was supposed to go through 1 cycle (maybe 1 or 2 passes?) but it didn't stop. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Same thing. I added more/less kitty litter, same thing. So I returned it. I will order another Littermaid box and hope that the new one doesn't have the same problems."
3,Iffy ....product!!,I have been using Litter Maid Litter Boxes since they first made an appearance on the market....in the middle 90's. I have had more than one Litter Maid at a time as I have had 2 cats. The new Litter Maid LM900 Mega I purchased is for a new cat. It hangs up when the rake is at the tray end starting the return cycle. The cats will not use it when the rake is at the dumping end of the litter box. The unit has to be taken a part to clean the debris away from the contacts on the dumping end. Sometimes the younger cat jumps at the bar and hits the stop bar causing it to lock up. I had to return one model that hung up and it would not release. This exchanged item has the same problem. I don't know if it is the model or a overall poor design. The small brush did not come with this model as is indicated in the list of parts that were included with the Litter Maid.Means More Work...
1,Very Disappointing!,"Do not purchase the Littermaid Mega! I had previously owned two Littermaid litter boxes that had lasted 3-4 years each. This model is so very disappointing.-Motor is too weak to move large clumps-The rake doesn't reach the bottom resulting in broken clumps and build up-The rake doesn't get close enough to the waste receptacle making smaller clumps fall back in the box and get pushed back behind the rakeI purchased the ""Mega"" model when our last Littermaid went out because we have 2 cats now and thought that the bigger size would be better. I wish I would have just bought the original model instead. As mentioned earlier this model has major problems that make it more work than just having a normal $5 litter pan that you scoop every day. If you are thinking of buying the ""Mega"" model I wouldn't. I am so disgusted that I have wasted over $100 on this product."
1,A waste of money,The items doesn't scoop out have of the waste as it states it will. Everytime my cat used the box it would only remove a very small portion of the waste and scrape the remaining behind the tines and we would have to take it apart and clean it everyday. I even used the litter they recommended.What a waste of money.
1,Low Quality,When it works it is a godsend. The problem is it dies after 4+ months. I have gone through two of them and both stopped working!!!!. Don't waste your money.
2,"OK, but not worth it","I had a LitterMaid for years. My first one (small) broke in about 8 months, so they sent me a new one - the Mega! I had good luck with their customer service, unlike most people.But after a while I realized I was spending way too much time scraping off the rake and the bottom, and getting woken up too much when it jammed and just ran back and forth.I decided I needed a change, so I did a bunch of research and changed both my litterbox and litter.The best automatic litterbox currently available is the Litter Robot (www.litter-robot.com). It's very expensive but very low maintenance. Check out the comments at www.litterbox-central.com (yes, seriously!).Please don't buy a LitterMaid; either stick with a cheap normal litterbox, or spend a little extra to do it right with a Litter Robot."
3,Great while it works,"We've bought two of these and they both quit working within 6 months. When it was working, it was great, shortly thereafter, it becomes more of a hassle than it is worth."
1,A Poor Product!! Not Worth The Money!! Don't Buy!!,"I am embarassed to say that I have purcased 3 Litter Maid Mega 900 Models and every single one died and untimely death right after the warranty period had expired. I liked the idea of the Litter Maid even though there were some ""issues"" with it. Like clumping of poo on the rake that would cause it to go over and over again. Cleaning the unit was a nightmare! I must say though I will not be buying a 4th one after the failure of the 3rd one I feel like the biggest fool in the world! Whats the old saying Fool me twice shame on me! Well after 3 SHAME ON ME! I wonder how many of these are clogging up landfills across the country?? I won't be buying a 4th one!"
3,doesn't work up to expectations,This was probably about my 4th littermaid. Usually they quit working after about 6 months. Some kind of mechanical defect. The most recent one I bought worked for only about a week. Disappointing product for the price paid.
1,New Littermaid does not work like the Old Littermaid,The old Littermaid design was fantastic. The new improved Littermaid does not work. Do not waste your money. You will be pi..ed off. All the old reviews were about the OLD STYLE Littermaid.Save your money until Littermaid returns to their original design.I am a long time Littermaid User. No Longer!!!!
1,Don't...,I had a littermaid a couple of years ago that lasted me for a year and did great. I am not sure what is wrong with this type we had it for a whole week then it stopped working. Do yourself a favor and do NOT get this.
3,it's pretty good... helps to not have to do it myself but still needs work,It helps minimize litterbox work but still needs to be scooped and changed more often than I would have thought.
5,Best litter box ever made,"I have had the LitterMaid LM900 Mega self cleaning litter box for 7 years, caring for three cats. Loved it! Finally broke the wiring and wanted to replace the box with the same model I had. Hard to find. The newer models have received poorer reviews. This box is great. Easy to clean, few parts to breakdown, and the best part is my cats really like this box."
4,A pretty good machine,"First of all, I have two indoor cats. They are both females. One is a trim cat and the other is a fat maine coon.Now as for the machine :On the good side, the machine works at least 80% of the time I'd say. I have had it at least a year and it has not broken. My cats got used to it quickly even though one of them is very timid. The cat box stench is greatly reduced. I know that it saves me ALOT of time from the disgusting chore of cleaning a litter box.On the bad side, the machine is stuck and blinking at least once a day. The urine seems to stall the machine because when I have to clean it, the urine is stuck to the bottom of the tray. The rake becomes disgusting within two weeks or so as poop cakes up in it. The machine is a hassle to clean compared to a regular box because you have to take the machine apart, soak parts etc.I would recommend this machine to others. Just be aware that it is a good helper, not an end all replacement for your chore of dealing with the cat box."
4,LM900 Mega works for us!,"After reading many negative reviews, I was was skeptical. But once our LM900 Mega arrived, it has worked well, and CONSIDERABLY reduced the cat box smell that everyone couldn't help but begin to notice. We have three cats and had to scoop two of of form litterboxes at least twice a day. Who has time for that? I have read that people have better luck with the Mega, so check your model. You may want to consider upgrading. Our cats seem to love it. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because sometimes the rake can't scoop up the tiny pieces of debris, but it isn't a dealbreaker by any means. Plus the waste recepticals and carbon filters are a bit pricey to maintain....but worth it!"
2,If you want to spend 2 hours a day cleaning your litter mess,"How dreadfully disappointing. I have wanted a self-cleaning litter box for years now, with 5 kids and 19 animals to take care of on our farm. As one reviewer said, getting this litter box to clean up after my 2 cats is as easy as getting my 8 year old to clean the box. The motor is unbelievably loud and screechy - it wakes me up several times a night, and is not even in my room. Yes, you can program it to stop during the night, thank goodness.The rake only dumps clumps in the general vicinity of the collection box. It does a great job of dumping litter on the sides, and underneath the collection box, however. I spend a hour a day sweeping the floor under and around this heavy, cumbersome machine.It is also huge - takes up at least twice the space of a normal box.It's basically awful. I can't really think of anything good to say about it."
4,Great litterbox!,"I ordered the Littermaid Litterbox as a replacement to one that I damaged by mistake. I have owned this product for years and wouldn't live without it. With 2 cats, it's great in keeping odor and litter tracking down and box cleaning to a minimum.I found over the years that a plastic grocery bag in the litter bin helps prolong the life of the plastic recepticals, and adding a bit of corn litter to premium litter aids in clumping and the overall daily cleanliness of the litter as well. Both tips have helped keep the costs of supplies to a minimum.I also suggest the privacy tent and filters as well if your litterbox is in an open area of any kind. If your cat is not a ""digger,"" an Oust Fan also does the trick."
4,Littermaid Hints,"I bought a littermaid a year ago. I had to for health reason. I love it. I had one probably with it is that I had to empty the littermaid every other day because she like to pee a lot. A month ago I stop using premium Fresh Step litter and change to Fresh Step Crystals. It works in the littermaid plus I only empty the littermaid once a week. That because the crystals absorb the pee. I have one cat the goes a lot so I have to but in new crystals in every 3 weeks. It is great no smell or cat tracking litter everywhere. If you decide to try the crystals only fill to add litter line. Any over that, the littermaid will give you trouble. In cost around $13 for 8 lbs.."
3,"Convenient, but stops working","We have three of these boxes - and only one cat. The problem is that they stop working. We have contacted the manufacturer, who states that the electric eye is probably dirty. They suggest popping out the small plastic covers & cleaning them. After doing this to no avail, we have bought a replacement & another after the same problem.That said, I still like it better than a traditional cat box. It is easier to dump the tray of discarded, soiled litter occassionally than scooping up small messes throughout the day. Even with our broken machines, we just manually flip the power switch which resets the mechanism, which then scoops away.I recommend spraying the box & tines with a silicone spray, as some of the other reviewers mention, it helps keep things cleaner. You may also have to wipe off stray spray occassionally.The price appears to have gone up by about $30. But still worth it over a long time."
3,LitterMaid LM900 Mega Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"This particular litter box is working okay. The previous one we had of the same make worked marvelous. The rake is really strong and works really well, but you have to make sure that the litter is always at the fill level. If not, the waste gets stuck to the box."
2,Replacement rakes are outrageous,"I have had a Littermaid for about 2 and a half years. I love the convenience of being able to let my 2 cats use the box and clean it only weekly. The motor has functioned perfectly over the lifetime of the box, and I reuse the plastic receptacles until they break. The only problem is the cheap construction of the rake. The wheels break off of the end of the rake without fail after around 6 months. I am currently on my 4th rake. You can order them from their Fox International website for $40 a pop. Each rake gets assessed a $10 shipping fee, so ordering 2 will cost the same which is an incredible rip off. After 3 rakes, you have essentially paid to replace the box. I keep ordering them though, due to the convenience of the box."
4,10 Minutes Ample Time for Clumping,"I suspect that people who complain that 10 minutes isn't time enough for clumping are allowing their cats to eat an inappropriate diet, resulting in messier stools. In this case, no clumping time is adequate. On my vets advice, I feed only dry food and stools are firm. Urine, of course, clumps immediately if you use a premium clumping litter as directed. Littermaid is not infallible, but it is a big help."
4,Could be better,"I love this litter box. Well, I love my second one. The motor on the first one broke after two weeks (seems to be a recurring problem). Thankfully, Amazon (the best!) replaced the litter box, mailed it to me for free, and included a label to cover shipping the first one back.I've had the second one for over a month now with no problems. It's still a litterbox, gets sandy and kind of gross, but not as bad at all!! And, it seems to take less litter than a regular system and so despite the price tag, I feel like I'm saving in the long run on liner/litter costs. Will always have something like this!"
5,"3 years & going strong, 2 cats + natural cat litter","I've had this for 3 years now & have had no problems. I have two cats & I have never had any problems with this. I can go about 3 to 4 days w/out emptying out the container. I've also found the perfect cat litter, it's called WORLD's BEST CAT LITTER. It's made of corn & doesn't produce much dust. It clumps nicely & the machine has no problems with it. I've been using it for over 2 years with my litter box."
4,Better than newer model,"I bought a LM900 when they first came out and my three cats used it untill last year when it finally gave up on me. I was so pleased with the LM900 that I decided to purchase another Littermaid. I found the LME9250, which is the newer model and sounded great. I have had so may problems with the LME9250 that when I found another LM900 on Amazon at a decent price I bought it and love it. I definately recommend the LM900 over the LME9250!"
4,Littermaid works!,"I've had my Littermaids for nearly 3 years and never had a problem with it. Yes, you do have to make sure you do not exceed the fill-line otherwise the rake will not work stop after one scoop. It will keep running back and forth and eventually burn out the mechanism. Not to mention, the cats will not use the box. I have two cats and need to empty the receptical about every other day. I reuse the receptial boxes for about a month or so -- no need to throw it away after a cleaning. I put the waste into a bag, tie a knot and put it in an outside trash bin. It's fairly easy to clean the litter box itself as the tray that holds the litter snaps off and you can just hose it down. The rake needs cleaning -- it comes with a scooper with teeth that fit between the rake and also a little brush. Nothing dealing with cat waste is all that pleasant but I find the Littermaid works for our two cats and it's more convenient then removing a bag and refilling a litterbox all the time."
5,What a time saver,"It's worth the cost not having to worry about cleaning a box periodically every day. We got the litterbox when our new puppy kept eating the cat ""treats"". I really don't need to empty it much either. once or twice a week. It's best to use very light clumping litter. I found ProPet's Fresh Results works great. The new hand scooper included is an improvement. It has tines that can clean between the automated scoops'. The collection bin is reuseable. I just dump the waste, hose it out, and spray with cleaner. The one thing I don't like is the carbon filters that stick inside on the lid of the collection bin. The glue isn't strong enough and it kept falling off on top of the waste. Yucky to pick up and have to stick back on. I just don't use it any more."
2,Expensive disappointment,"The first thing I noticed when our (2)cats began using the LitterMaid was the odor. We didn't have litter box odor before but when the mechanical box scooped the litter into the small receptacle, the odor became intense. Then there was the extra time we spent keeping the LitterMaid clean, and all the loose litter that ended up underneath the trap area. We began spending money on extra mats, canvas, screens, anything that would make the LitterMaid more private and cleaner. We realized we were spending excessive money to make this litter box work for us, and unusual amounts of time cleaning up the mess the litter box was making instead of simply cleaning up after our cats, which wasn't nearly as difficult or time consuming. We just bought a new box called Clevercat which we are very pleased with."
2,Self Cleaning Litter Box,I never should have bought this. It clumps up and many times the unit gets stuck. You have to keep buying the plastic trays. I ended up throwing it out and just getting a regular litter box. It sounds great but it isn't. ( I only have one cat too!)
1,DOESN'T WORK,"I bought this thinking it would help with both cats. Well, I plugged it in and the only way it works is if I turn it off and on. Then it seems to get off track and I have to move it back in line.I wouldn't recommend this for any cat lover."
4,Better than the new 9000 series,I much prefer my old LM920 -- but it finally died.The new LM9000 series is very cheaply made. I maight just call LM directly to buy another 920 then trash this piece of junk!
1,This litter box STINKS! (Literally!!),"I wish I had read some of the other reviews of this crappy product before I bought it. We have two cats and thought this would be the solution to dealing with cat litter everyday. How wrong we were!!The rake was constantly getting stuck and clogged with used litter clumps - this requires you to scrape the clump off the rake (much more up close and personal than I like to be with cat crap). This will especially be a problem if your cats tend to use the bathroom in the same place in the box (which also requires you to redistribute the waste in the receptacle at least once a day). This, combined with the relatively small amount of litter that you can use, made the odor much worse than with a regular box we cleaned every day.So, as I see it, this thing is actually MORE work than just cleaning the litterbox once a day...with no payoff. Not to mention the cost of the thing and its pricey receptacles."
1,Stops Working,"I purchased this product and after three months the rake would not stop--according to the manufacturer, it was a dirty sensor. After cleaning everything, they instructed me to return the item for a new replacement. The replacement lasted one month. I give up!"
1,Not yet - - - it doesn't work,The biggest problem with this litter box is that sooner or later you will have to take it apart and clean the rake. That is messier than scooping and much dirtier. Overall I spent twice the total amount of time using this than just plain scooping and four times the trouble.
1,Not worth it,"i purchased this item hoping it would be useful. I was wrong. You constantly have to scrap the rake, big clumps get stuck to it. The litter also gets stuck to the bottom despite using a non stick spray. the recepticles also get full very quickly. I have 3 cats and I would change the recepticle everyday, it was full and always dirty to touch. the customer service is also horrible, you have to call about 4 diffrent numbers before you actually speak with someone understandable and halpful. I defenitly don't recemend this product."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This litterbox was the worst product I ever spent my money on! I've owned it for about two months and the rake wont retract back to its resting place. When it did work, the rake flung the little clumps all over the place. I spent more time cleaning after this box then I did my old box. And it didn't contain the oder that much better then the manual litterbox. I've already decided to go back to my old litter box and get rid of this one. Anyone want to buy a slightly used LitterMaid?"
1,So far it been a poor buy on my part !,I just got my Litterbox today and have not seen it in action yet. In hopes I shall stay. Best Of Luck All !
2,"Poor Design, Easily Breaks, Messy","The entire design of the whole Littermaid series of self-cleaning boxes is unfortunately flawed. After owning 3 different models of these cleaners, I would recommend a deep box, non-motorized, and a good scooper."
1,DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This produce may look like a time saver, but when it runs the smallest amount of waist will kill the motor and the system will keep on reversing and keep on trying to pick it up. When it does finally do so it only will pick up half of the wait. There is no way of cleaning it. Don't waist your money on this, if you are looking for a good automatic litter box check out the Litter-Robot."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"If you like making a job twice as hard than it should be: this is the product for you. I spend more time cleaning the caked on litter from the rake and the bottom of the box than just scooping a regular litter box. Customer service is horrible (they will just tell you to spray Pam on the rakes and the bottom to keep the litter from sticking). The motor is only powerful enough to push all the litter to the front of the litter box (which is where it all stays) and leaves just enough litter behind so when my cat does his business it cakes the remaining litter and makes a huge mess. I have since unplugged the box from the wall, and I have a much easier time cleaning the litter than when it was in the ""automated"" mode. So I basically spent over $100 for a conventional litter box."
4,So far pleased with my purchase,I had my last littermaid for over 6 years and never had a problem and then it died. I hope to have the same luck with my new and improved litter box
4,Cat loves it.,i have had no problems with this self cleaning litter box. It does everything it is supposed to do. I think that getting premium clumping litter like the manual recommends is very important. My cat likes having a clean box every time she goes to it. I can tell because the cat used to howl at the door to go outside and that has not happened once since getting this litter box.
5,love this item,do not have to clean up after the cats litter box no more. just dump what is in the tray after it get full and be finished. Fast delivery and in good condition.
1,Not as good as older model Litter Maid,"I purchased my first Litter Maid 10 years ago and it worked fine for a number of years with our 3 cats. Naturally, when the time came to purchase a new one, I purchased a new LM. I was delighted to see what I thought were improvements to the product - removable comb, with metal teeth. This LM does not seem to have the ""horsepower"" or strength to push the litter up and over into the receptacle. The litter gets stuck in the main pan and I have to scoop by hand. Somehow, I think the new design comb has something to do with it. While its great to be able to remove the comb to clean, it does not move the litter. For the most part, I end up scooping the litter by hand anyways. It was a waste of money."
2,LItterMaid,Worked great for 6 months and then just stopped working. I went from very pleased to very disappointed over night.
5,Perfection,"Once again, everything promised came to fulfillment! The CD was in perfect condition - came earlier than promised - what more could you ask for!"
3,"Ok, but quite large",I see this item is not available anymore on Amazon. This was a quite large container for a Palm and some other objects. I frankly ended up not using it much as it was just so large. I suppose it would make some sense if you had another thing like a briefcase or purse to put it in.
5,exactly what you'd expect,"What can I say, it's an iron. It does exactly what it should. The steam is really strong and, unlike the iron I'm replacing, it doesn't drip water. The steam burst option is great for freshening up suits and just getting wrinkles out of items that have been smashed in my minuscule closet. It only takes a minute to heat up. All in all, I'd buy it again. I've never had a bad product from Black & Decker."
1,wrong quantity advertised,I was attracted to this add a few times.The discription of quantity is incorrect.The add states 3 sets of brushes.In the discription it says you will receive 3 identical sets of brushes for a TOTAL OF 9 BRUSHES.But when you received your order you will receive 1 package of 3 paint brushes NOT 9.When you make a claim for incomplete order you will be told no add says 3 sets.In one case when I ordered these brushes I was told by the seller that it was a wrong discription by Amazon.I replayed this back to Amazon in my complaint.The seller made good on the quantity and sent me 2 more packets of 6 total brushes to complete the order for a total of 9 as advertised.Bottom line the discriptions have not been changed.So unless you want a hassel would not recomend this advertised item.
1,NOT SECURE!!!!!,We have two of these cages for our two teddy bear hamsters and they have each managed to escape with all of the closures securely latched. One of them managed to separate the tube that goes up the back from the enclosure on the top. The other somehow squeezes through the bars. We are ditching these cages in favor of something more secure as I am sick and tired of looking for/trapping my hamsters.
5,penn plax cage,had good luck with larger cage so i got one of these smaller ones for one of the babies. works out fine except for them getting out of the travel door. we secured this with bread ties on either side and have had no further problems with escapees.
1,Hamster escaped first night:(,"Got this cage yesterday, was fairly easy to put together. Our hamster escaped from it the first night he was in it. Not sure why they don't put a lock latch on the top part of the enclosure. Lock seems sturdy on door of main cage. Apparently he pushed the top door open. Would have been nice if the top latch was more secure. Hope we find him. My daughter will be heartbroken."
2,missing piece and package looked used!,"My daughter (11 years old) wanted a pet rat. OK, I'm open to trying new critters. Searched extensively for a quality home that would protect the pet from current cats in the house, ease of access for her, ease of cleaning, etc. I purchased this product and the wires are appropriately spaced for a baby rat (not too wide) and putting it together was OK. The wheel attachment was missing from the parts and the box itself looked like it had been opened and banged up a bit.The baby rat is currently in his/her new home, when it is not being cuddled by my daughter. I would like to have had the wheel be usable though! Also, the wires are very pliable and literally HAD to be bent BACK into shape for assembly. Frustration for my daughter, but learning patience and how to problem solve is always useful!"
2,The Jetsons season two is dumbed down and inferior compared to season one.,"Compared to season one of the Jetsons, the stories in season two are dumbed down and inferior. Whereas the background music from season one was fun, interesting, and quirky, the background music from season two is dull, bland, and generic. And while the animation in season one was simple and got the job done, the computerized blurring of the backgrounds in season two makes the cartoons look quite sterile."
3,It's not quite the Jetsons of Season 1,"I enjoy the Jetsons so I purchased this DVD set (S2:V1) to fill in my collection. Even before my purchase I knew that the quality of episodes was not going to match season 1. In this regard, I'm not disappointed.My six year old really enjoys the cartoons. As an adult, I notice that the writing and production quality isn't as high as I'd seen before. The addition of a new recurring character in the first episode makes it seem as there was an intent to provide opportunities for new story lines, but in my opinion this had the opposite effect.Die-hard Jetson fans may like having this set in their collection. For those who've never seen the Jetsons should start with Season 1."
1,did B&D even test this thing?,"I've had this little thing forever - but I only use the chopping blade. Did they even TRY shredding a carrot..cheese....anything? Because I gotta tell you, I make my living as a personal chef, so I'm pretty handy when it comes to familiarizing myself with culinary appliances; I just though maybe I mixed up some parts from some other appliance, or wasn't assembling it correctly. The shredder/slicer attachment is so faulty that's it's actually kind of funny (only after you've lassoed the shreds of kamikaze cheddar that stormed the counter, floor, and pretty much anywhere BUT the bowl and recovered from a brief spell of vertigo as a result). Um....don't get it? yeah - don't get it."
1,Terrible!!,"This thing is terrible. As others have said, food chute is too small. You have to pre-chop everything to fit it in. And food sprays all over the place. Shred cheese? Not a chance. You'll end up with tiny balls of cheese that get mashed around on the inside. B&D; has NEVER tested this product, otherwise it would not be on store shelves.Oh, and if you have any light-sleepers in the house, I wouldn't turn this on. It is INSANELY loud. It can wake up my 1 yr old, while he's sleeping upstairs.Did I mention the blades are about as sharp as a butter knife?"
1,Waste of money!!!,"I used to have a Hamilton Beach mini processor, and when it finally died, I got this one. I mainly use it to make pesto and cheese dip. Neither cubed cheese or basil leaves will chop in this machine. The blades cnnot standup to anything stiffer than cooked carrots, and it Doesn;t chop to anything resembling uniform. Glad I only spent $15, b/c this is going in the TRASH!"
5,Great little processor!,This Black and Decker processor is great! It is compact and SO easy to clean! I purchased it to grind up baby food. It works great! I haven't used that attachment on top yet but it looks interesting for blending fruits or whatever. Definitely worth the money.
3,Good with limitations,"I use this mainly to grind pulses and veggies and it does a great job. But it is extremely noisy and the grater and other chopper attachments are not impressive. Food flies out as said in the other reviews and it is difficult to clean, unless one is using it for something really dry in which case, just a rinse will do. If one is okay with noise(a lot of that), then this is good to buy. Else, look for options. I am looking too..."
3,ACCEPTABLE,"This product was purchased to replace the broken chopper/shredder by Black & Decker that cracked after several years. I found the new product to be average as compared to the earlier version. Cheese tends to stop the shredding blade entirely. Otherwise the product works if you have a small size bowl to put under the dispensing spout. Black and Decker should heed the old adage; 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'."
1,Awful design,"This item is very poorly designed for shredding cheese. This was the primary reason I bought it. The cheese does not flow out of the spout, it balls up inside. Would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Shredder/Processor,I looked all over for a Mini Food Processor/Shredder combo. Settled for the Black and Decker MFP200T. Works well and I hope it holds up for more than a year or so. I would recommend this unit for those who lack space and those who do occasional shredding/processing.
2,Am I using this right?,"I got this as a wedding present. Two years later, I tried to use the shreding function for the first time. Usually I mince things by hand for the best texture but my 6 month old wanted to be worn and mincing isn't safe while wearing a grabby baby. I had tried using the shredding attatchment on my kitchen aid mixer but it makes things mushy. So I broke this out. I thought a piece must be missing, so I looked this up to see. Nope, it is put together correctlyRadishes got all over the counter.I used masking tape and saran wrap to direct the chute properly. The radishes got backed up and mushy. I put the chopper on a large cookie tray to catch the radish shreds. That worked.Am I missing something? Did I lose a piece? Why is this so poorly designed."
1,Not happy,"Very disappointed. Was given the food processor as a gift, waited a year to open it so had no receipt. Made a horrible noise and chunks of mushy cheese when I tried to grate cheese, and now, after using for a couple months less than 10 times total, it died. Do not recommend."
1,Cheap and deafeningly loud,"I bought this to replace an older model, and this one is cheaply made and deafeningly loud. I placed it on the counter and had to take both hands and plug my ears while it pulverized cereal, yes just cereal. Either they crammed too large of a motor into a too thin case, or it's just the design that lends itself to amplify the noise. There are also too many pieces and nothing to hold them all together, so it's not convenient to store. I'm glad it's at the pricepoint that it is, as I ended up donating it to a local thrift store after one use."
2,B and D Mini Pro is too loud!,"I owned the first generation of this product and still use it at another residence. It's about 15 years old. This one I am donating to charity. It is so loud, bursting into squeals of high pitched, sonic like noise. The machine does what it professes to do but is cheap, cheap, cheap. But, afterall,I didn't pay much for it. Buyer beware!"
1,Mini pro food processor,Would not recommend this to anyone. Certainly is not nearly as good as the original Handy Shortcut. If you shred something it shoots out everywhere.
1,who is responsible?,"This is the latest generation that began with the B & D shortcut, which arguable was one of the worst products every manufactured. While this is an improvement, it begs the question, why does Black and Decker feel they must be in the food business when very clearly they can't design products that work for the consumer. The big issue here is getting the parts to fit together so you can use the product. Same as it ever was."
3,Would never pay full price for it,"I shop Amazon all the time. But, I bought my BD MFP200T at a garage sale for $5.00. Glad I did not shell out any more for it. When I got home and started to use it, I too thought something was missing. So, I decided to look it up on Amazon. This item had a pic of the parts. I do have all that came with it. But, the chute for the slicing and grating is as you all say, poorly designed. I can't imagine how the company let this get by to production either. You'd have to tape plastic wrap around the chute opening to direct the food into the bowl, if that would even work. I also am not sure how to fit the grating side of the blade up. It won't sit right. The slicing side of the blade will fit fine."
1,Works Great.... $45/Bottle??????,"These antacids work great. Better than the little pills. Better than Maalox, Rolaids, or Tums. But WTH?!? My husband ordered these. 4 bottles plus shipping came to $190.29?!? That's not right! I think he must have thought he was ordering 12 total, or something like that. Gonna return these. They're cheaper at the local grocery store!"
5,Good Stuff,This is good stuff but it is exspensive! One tablet is all you need for instant relief which lasts all night long.
5,Pepcid complete,"Pepcid complete, mint, is THE BEST antacid on the market!!! Hard to come by, but worth the effort to get it."
4,Much better than the generic,"This is far better than the generic with a softer tablet, however I can't seem to located the mint flavor, which I would prefer."
5,Pepcid,Arrived vey quickly and happy to find this product again as I have had no luck in my local pharmacies
5,Pepcid Complete,I purchased this product for my mother because she was not able to purchase it locally. She is very happy with the product and it works just wonderfully for her. It handles all her digestive needs.
1,A bad buy,"I am sorry to say this but I have use the cooling mint Pepcid Complete for a very long time and it was taken off the market and still has not returned to the store shelves so I thought I would order it online. The product was wonderful and I found it to be available through Amazon. It was more than double the price that the product sold for and that would not be a problem if the product was ok. The chewable tablets were not chewable, they had a chalky taste and and were hard as a rock. The tablets did not even resemble the original product. I tried using them three times and couldn't take it anymore. Sorry but you asked me for an evaluation. First bad one I ever made."
1,disappointing and frustrating,Unfortunately I received the incorrect product and paid 2x as much for this order and am extremly disappointed that I have not received any satisfaction. I was charged 131.00 for 100 tablets and I ordered 200. Most disappointing but what is more so is that there is noone to speak to or handle this.
1,old pepcid dont get scr-wed,i bought pepcid it was the old pepcid it sucks its the chaulky ones the guy that sold it to me probably new he had the old stuff thanks pal
4,Pepsin Complete,Prompt service. great sellerWhat else can I say. We like this product however it is a bit priceyThis product works better than the generics
4,Pepcid Complete-mint,"If you have frequent heartburn, this product works very well. I take one in the morning and one in the evening and it really reduces heartburn. The mint flavor is soothing as well. You only have to take one of these and it is the equivalent of taking several tablets of the popular antacid. My only complaint is that it is very expensive and you can get similar formulas in prescription form from your doctor that will cost much less if you have a drug coverage plan."
5,Pepcid Complete,Pepcid Complete works so well for Acid Reflux and Heartburn. I wasn't able to find it in stores...all the shelves were empty. It was such a relief to be able to find it here and have it delivered so quickly!
4,Rip Off,"Great product as we all know; I bought these on Amazon last week for $50 for 50 tabs, which is twice the normal price, now it's $69 bucks for 50!!). These sellers are scum bags, and so is J&J for giving about 10 ambiguous answers as to why this product is unavailable. When it comes back on the market...if it does, all us users should never buy anything from these current rip-off sellers on Amazon."
2,Tablets were broken,"Many tablets inside the bottle were broken, so when you try to get one out of the bottle, you just get peices and dust, very frustrating and messy."
5,Why did they take it out of stores?,"This is one of the best products I have ever used. Now I can't find it in stores, why? One Pepsid Complete and the heart burn is gone is less than 30 minutes. Got to have my Pepsid. By the way the replacement product is for the birds."
5,Only thing that works on my husband!,"My husband has tried a number of different products to relieve his heartburn with little success...he finally tried Pepcid and he feels a lot better now. Thank you, I couldn't find it in the stores around here."
3,Great Product - the price is to HIGH !,"You should be able to buy this product in larger quantities for about 25 cents per table.50 cents is to high. It's roughly $1 each when sold separately or in small quantities, but if you take this stuff every night like I do, you'll want to shop around."
5,Forget the Plop Plop Fizz fizz,"Since I can't get this over the counter anywhere in my area, I totally search anywhere I can find it......it works in an instant. Some people like the Omeprazol or Prilosec and swear by that product, but one of these at the sign of acid reflux, and I have relief - more times than not - for the entire day, so I am glad Amazon has sites open to purchasing this great product."
4,Wish it was mint flavor,We have never found anything that works better than this. but I really which they still had the Mint flavored kind
5,Pepcid Complete Berry Blend,This is a hard to find product. I use them all the time. I personally prefer fruit flavored to mint flavored.
1,Wrong barrery,"The battery I received doesn't look like the one pictured, it had no writing, not even the polarity. I would return but the postage is more than the battery. The one sent is too large to fit into the razors case."
3,"so far, it works","If you get this as replacement for your Norelco shaver... be aware that it has to be soldered into the shaver... quite a tricky operation which requires a major dis-assembly, using a solder gun to remove the old battery and nimble fingers to get the new one installed and re-assembled. Be sure to mark the positive side on the printed circuit board so you can install the battery with the correct polarity. So far it accepts a charge and runs the shaver about the same speed as the OEM battery... which lasted about 4 years with not much use."
3,ni-cad ???,"Ship fast great. Great price, Only problem no + or - signs and no writing on battery. ni-cad ??? Does not match photo shown"
2,Good but has faults,"The concept of the Hot Shoe cable is good but it has a major flaw. When the hot shoe cable is attached to my camera's hot shoe, the connection physically prevents the pop-up flash from popping up rendering the pop-up flash inoperable. There are times when I would like to use both the pop-up flash and my external flash at the same time but that is not possible with the hot shoe cable attached. I must turn off the pop-up flash before I can use the external flash. My camera is the Olympus EvoltE-500."
2,BIG MISTAKE,"I received this as a Christmas present from some friends. After carefully examining the instructions, I thought it was pretty clear how to use this coffeemaker.There is a drain hole in the back and if you accidentally overfill it or have it filled to the max line and need to move the coffeemaker, water pours out from the back through this hole.When I made my first pot of coffee, everything went well. The 2nd pot wasn't so good -- I had coffee grounds literally sputtering out all over the place (walls, counter, all over the machine.It is a messy unit as well. When removing the basket to empty it, i've noticed that the basket is often still filled with coffee that hadn't drained into the pot.I've had better coffeemakers in the past that brewed into a carafe; the coffee doesn't stay hot as long as some of the more expensive units, the spout isn't that great; it dribbles.I would strongly suggest spending the extra money on a better quality unit."
2,Loved it and Hated it,"We really loved this machine, especially the thermal carafe that kept coffee hot and tasty for longer than anything else we used.Unfortunately the screw on top for the carafe has to be set at exactly the right place when you put it in the machine, otherwise the mechanism for opening the top doesn't work right and the brewed coffee will cascade all over your counters and floors rather than into the pot. This would be a perfect coffee maker otherwise, definitely our coffee maker for life, but it's bad enough to have that kind of spill happen once much less once or twice a month."
1,Stopped working,"I had a pervious Black & Decker Thermal carafe coffeemaker for years and loved it. I replaced it with a new one, when I broke the carafe cleaning it (I didn't read the directions on how to clean it). So I bought another one but it leaked out of the bottom ,after about two months so I exchanged it for a new one. That one literally stopped working after about a month, so I returned that one. I would not recommend buying this coffeemaker, but I do love the carafe feature and plan on buying another coffeemaker with this feature."
2,I thought I liked it,"I too had an exploding carafe. I really liked this machine but did have an overflow problem once and it was a huge mess to clean up. After over a year of use my carafe exploded when I was cleaning it. I thought it was just something I did wrong, but now after reading these reviews I see it wasn't just me. I originally came on here to order a new one, but seeing that I'm not the only one I'll be ordering a different brand. Be careful cleaning this product."
3,Still undecided whether I like it!,I received this product for christmas and it has overflowed 3 times already. I am sure I have placed it in correctly not sure why it would overflow. The 5 or 6 times it didn't over flow the coffee was great and it stayed hot.
2,A fat shot,"The title of this book contains ""NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming)."" However, there are no definitions about NLP in this book at all. The only explanation about NLP is: ""There's not much theory to digest, because NLP is all about what ""works."" That's it.I got just one idea about pre-shot routine from this book. Each chapter contains a silly Q & A section. I'd appreciate it more if they (authors) published this 208 page book as thin as 50 pages."
2,BORING,"This has to be one of the most boring, pointless games ever created. The graphics are almost as poorly done as the basic mechanics of the game. You wander aimlessly around in a world of blocky graphics and stupid lurching monsters, looking for ridiculous clues and puddles of water, yes I said puddles of water. You have a special sight ability which makes the graphics even fuzzier and blocky than without it. I have no idea why they would bother with a camera angle that either has you at truly third person or a few inches closer so you can look over the main character's shoulder. What is the point of that? In fact, what is the point of this game...oh, that's right, they released a movie so of course, there should be a game. Trust me, rent this game before you spend your money...it's not even worth the rental fee."
4,Old but still good,I missed the oppertunity to play it on the xbox. So i got it for the 360. I liked the move and the comics so i figured the game had to be good.
4,"Really, I would give it 4 1/2, but no option for that...","This is such a FUN book! While it is not specifically geared to the scrapbooker (more to designers), I still found it highly inspirational. I have been scrapping for about five years now with my main subject having always been my daughter. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with that (she will always be my 'main' focus, I'm sure), I have found myself wanting to scrap more of the 'everyday' as a way to record our lives for future generations to (hoepfully) enjoy. With that comes photographing our environment and the items/objects within it. This book offers some great ideas and inspiration and I LOVE the fact that the author is careful to include that most of the pictures in the book can be (and were) taken with a non-SLR camera...this is important to me because I don't have one and probably won't be able to afford one anytime soon. It's nice to see examples of great pictures taken by a point-and-shoot."
4,"great book, but...",my copy arrived slightly used looking. A bit dirty around the edges and had half a sticker of some sort stuck to the back which is disappointing since this was supposed to be a gift for my boyfriend who's trying to explore photography more.
5,great idea book,"Great book for inspiring ideas. Love the ""field guide"" layout. Makes for quick reference. A must for every amateur photographer's library."
4,Good collection of ideas,"A handy and comprehensive collection of ideas, some known, some not depending on your experience but I think that anyway it is worth to have it. One stands over all: experiment.Covers almost every subject, indoor, outdoor, people, things, landscapes. At least for the moment (I have not finished it), it goes not deep into technical matters. More from the artist point of view.I reccomentd it without any doubt."
4,Great book!!!,"This book is very inspiring, and has a lot of great Ideas. I was kind of in a slump and this book helped get me out of it. Many excellent shots. Even people w/o SLR's could really get inspired from it."
3,not sure I'll even read it,"Doesn't really grab me, I don't have a lot of interest in taking pictures of toy airplanes on a piece of paper..."
2,Poor Quality,"Classic Intermissions, poor quality, I've bought better quality of the same clips elsewhere. They do include alot of clips but just not up to my standards."
3,new mommie,"My husband and I love this monitor, BUT when we just tested it out the remote/walkie part has a lot of noise in it and it keeps making a clicking noise. And the volume control on the music doesn't actually do much to turn the volume down. I feel that we are going to take this back tomorrow and try to find a better one. The only thing is this is the only monitor that has a projection on it and we really like this feature but the static and clicking kind of defeats the purpose of having a monitor? But I think after reading other responses I might try to get the same one and see if it is just this 'one' because we really want to keep the projection."
1,Don't buy this if it's a good monitor you want!,The sound quality of this monitor is TERRIBLE!! We bought it because we liked the two-way communication feature and the sound and light show. The two-way sound is awful- hardly recognizable enough to comfort baby. The light show is awesome and the sounds are great-- but isn't this supposed to be a monitor above all? On that count it fails utterly. We will NEVER use this again or recommend it to anyone... not after we used it while in another part of the house and then discovered that our infant had been crying hysterically to the point of hyperventilating and we NEVER HEARD A PEEP with this monitor. Tremendously disappointed with this product. Stay away!
1,All the bad reviews are right!,"I also got this monitor because I registered for it. What a waste! All the reivews that talk about the horrible static and clicking are exactly right. What they failed to mention, though, is the random static bursts that monitor itself emits. They rarely fail to wake the baby up. What is also frustrating -- and one of the dumbest things I've seen in a long time -- is the ""soothe"" function. I thought this was designed to actually soothe the baby. It's not. If you have the light show and music on, and the baby begins to cry, it shuts off. Don't waste your money. Get a cheaper monitor and a good mobile. You'll be better off."
1,Clickety Clack Clack,If you think you are sleep deprived now just wait until you get this monitor. It has great features but it clicks constantly. You are up listening to the sound of the monitor rather than the sound of your baby crying. I called Fisher Price and they said that this monitor makes a clicking noise because of the transmission of all the features. There is no way to get rid of it. It isn't worth the lack of sleep.
3,The Tic Sound Is a Killer,The monitor'sd details are great.The projection and the music is great.BUT...the tic tic tic sound that it projects is the biggest pain in .....I can't take it .I use the baby monitor' projection just put put my son to sleep..I do not use it as a monitor because of the staic noise.
3,Good & Bad,"The light and music show is nice...the monitor stinks. You can hear the baby, etc..but there is a lot of static and clicking. Also, if my baby cries or someone makes a loud noise, it turns itself on. That is OK if the baby cries then it distracts her. I think $50.00 for this is a little much since the monitor part of this product stinks so bad."
1,Blast of Static,"We bought this monitor for all the wonderful features...the ceiling light show, the fact that it was remote controlled, and you could talk to the baby and not be in the room. What we did not plan on purchasing with this monitor was the constant clicking and the LOUD blast of static that happens frequently. The blast of static is so loud it wakes us and the baby up all through the night. We called Fisher Price and they said the blast of static was most likely cellular phone and cordless phone interfernce.....but after reading all the reviews and how everyone has this problem...I'm guessing this is just a poorly made piece of equipment. We have baby number 2 on the way and are buying a new monitor. Fisher Price wouldn't replace our monitor either...we were willing to send them the one we have in exchange... but they refused."
1,Very noisy monitor,"We registered for this monitor because of all the great features. We were very disappointed, however, that the receiver was so loud it would keep us awake more than our new baby! Even when our baby would cry, it was hard to hear him over all the static and humming of the receiver. If you want a real monitor, don't get this one. We have tried two monitors since and recommend the Sony Baby Call (27 channel) monitor. It is truly a high-tech piece of equipment and so clear it sounds like the baby is in the room with you."
1,AWFUL MONITOR!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!!,"All you can hear is STATIC with this thing!!!! Definately not worth the price!!!! It looks cute, but don't work! Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Big Disappointment,"This product was a big disappointment. The static is so bad that we can barely hear our son crying and to get the lights to even go to the second level he has to be crying histerically. Also, you basically have to have the monitor in the bed with him so he can see the projection on the ceiling. The only good thing I have found about this product is that you can turn the music on without going in the room, but when you do turn the music on you really cannot hear your child at all. I would highly recommend going with another product."
1,Not worth the money.,"We registered for this product despite of all of the bad reviews. I thought if it is from Fisher-price and has all kinds of features to it how bad can it be? Really bad. The monitor clicks loud enough to keep you awake whenever it is on and the base picks up static in bursts that wakes my daughter up from a sound sleep. My daughter enjoyed the light show, but we no longer use even that. It is supposed to go on whenever the baby cries, but it shuts itself off with the next scream. So if she is crying the monitor goes on and off -it does not help to soothe anyone. Even the night light is too dim to do any good. If you are thinking about buying this monitor think twice."
2,It's Only Good for the Light Show,This monitor is not worth the money! The ticking that goes on through the night is enough to make you go through the roof! And it drowns out the baby. The only thing we use it for now is the light show when we're changing our daughter. She loves to watch it and listen to the music. It was rather disappointing!
1,We returned ours to the store.,"We bought this monitor as a replacement for the monitor we currently use for our 3 year old son which was getting staticky after 3 years of continual use. We only used it for about 2 days before packaging it up and returning it to the store. When the channels are set correctly the monitor clicks and it is not nearly sensitive enough for our liking. My current old monitor allowed us to hear our sons breathing while the static on this model barely allowed us to hear other noises in or out of the room. We thought the lights and projection might also entertain our toddler but he was not very fond of them at all and insisted that we turn them off. Overall, not a good buy and I would not recommend it."
3,"A cute monitor, but has downfalls","I got this monitor for my little twins, and they love it. Every night when they go to bed, I turn it on and they watch the moons and stars go across the ceiling and usually fall asleep before it automatically shuts off. It isn't very clear when you try to talk on it, and it does make clicking noises. Once in a while, it even makes a noisy static sound for just a second. It doesn't affect my ten-week-olds, who could sleep soundly through a train wreck, but for the babies that wake easily, this might not be a good idea. It mows through batteries like a hot knife through butter, too. Use the AC adapter whenever you can or prepare to buy a 9-volt battery every single day. My two like it though. They probably couldn't get to sleep right away without it."
2,So disappointing,"We purchased this monitor thinking it would be a great way to help our 2 year old transition into his big boy room, but were quickly aware this might have not been the best choice. There is a constant clicking sound that comes through the monitor receiver, the lights are not indicitive of the baby's cries, it turns on at random times and last night static surges woke our 2 year old up at 5 a.m. What a disappointment since our son likes the light show so much...but there is just too many negatives to keep using this monitor."
3,Noisy and not worth it,"I got this monitor as a gift at my shower. I was so excited to take it home and play with the really cool features. That was all it was. I could hear this horrible click, click, click noise over the songs this thing played. That wasn't the only thing. The two way communication walkie talkie thing sounded like something out of Hellraiser. My voice was very rough and scratchy. I was going to keep the monitor because I thought the cute features were neat and I could get over the clicking, till I found out that another monitor that cost [$$$] was perfect. NO CLICKING WHAT SO EVER! It was so clear I couldn't belive it for the price. Let me think here [$$$] or [$$$]? You make the choice about how clear you would like to here your child breathing."
2,very disappointed,"My husband and I recieved this monitor as a shower gift,(I did register for it) in the store it sounded so good with the light show and the two way communication and the music, but first off the music keeps my son up instead of putting him to sleep and it is hard to get the light show to go directly over the crib without having to put the monitor on a slant, i leaned it on a teddy bear. I find that it has alot of static, the static gets so loud in the night it wakes me up and then i lower the volume to get rid of the static but then the volume is so low i cant hear my son. Also when i unplug it even with a battery in it, it clicks a very very loud click that i have to just plug it back in and even sometimes when its plugged it it still clicks.I am defintly returning this monitor and i would not recommend buying it, even though it sounds enticing."
2,Great Features Horrible Reception,"I only gave this product 2 stars because of all the features. I love this product because of the features but it has horrible reception. My bedroom is across the hall from my daughter's, about 10 feet, and there is a horrible clicking noise. If I turn it up, I can't even fall asleep because the noise is so loud!"
1,Disappointed with Fisher-Price,"We bought this monitor because of all the great features. Unfortunately the only one that worked was the picture show and that was so bright, it kept our son awake. The static is so loud, we couldn't hear the baby cry. The volume control doesn't work. It's on loud all the time. And to top it all off, it broke after just two weeks! Great concept, but it needs much improvement."
2,Noisy Monitor,I have this monitor and I thought for the price that I would be getting a good one. I was wrong. It's not a great monitor at all. It is very noisy and makes a loud noise every once in a while (I guess it's static). The receiver is VERY loud. I've had to adjust it sooo low so that it won't keep me awake at night. I've tried both channels and neither one is clear. It is very annoying and most of the time I just leave it off and use my motherly instinct to hear her anyway. I can't even hear the little noises she makes - I only hear her crying. I wouldn't recommend this monitor. I love Fisher Price toys and have never had a problem with them but I will buy another monitor for the next baby!!
1,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!,"Some advice to All parents...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought this monitor thinking that with all the perks it offered,it had to be a great monitor. That along with the ""prestigious"" Fisher Price name and being a new mom led me to this conclusion. The static is loud at any volume you set it to. The receiver clicks nonstop, and I do mean NONSTOP. I called customer service and I was told that that is how I was supposed to know it's working. Mind you, it's so loud that I can't hear the baby when he cries. I thought that would be a pretty good indicator that it was working, however fisher price disagrees with me. Her exact words were "" With all the bells and whistles included in this product, that is really just a minor inconvenience"". Whoaw. Don't.. I repeat, don't buy this. The swirling light show just isin't worth it."
1,We expected much better from Fisher Price,"What a wonderful concept if only it worked. We purchased this monitor because of all the ""great"" features. The light show and music are great but the monitor itself was horrible. We had nothing but static. We could not even hear our son. The monitor would shut on & off on it's own. The intercom mode would be great if it worked properly. Voices come through very distorted on both units. This feature should be to reassure your child not scare them.My personal opinion for anyone would be to NOT buy this product if your looking for the security a monitor should give you. If you are looking for a light show for your child then this is for you. We have since purchased the Evenflo Constant Care monitor ~ We love it! It gives all the security we expected from a monitor."
1,Don't waste your time,"We bought this because of the additional features it offered compared with other monitors. Several problems:1. There is a constant pulsing on both channels (my friend's monitor works fine in our house so we don't have a local interference problem).2. Yes, you can talk to your baby using the handset but it's distorted so much it's scary!3. The light show is nice but there is no focus adjustment so it doesn't look that great.4. The soothing sounds are not soothing due to the constant background buzzing. In fact, it just sounds cheap and nasty."
1,Not worth the money!,"I thought that I would ignore the reviews I had read about this monitor, ""It couldn't be that bad"" I thought to myself, well I was wrong! This monitor is terrible! There is so much static and clicking in the receiver that I couldn't hear my son and my husband and I couldn't sleep with it on. The reason we got a monitor was to be able to hear our baby and all we could hear was interference with this monitor. Not only was the static bad but you can't position the projector where you want it so pretty much the only way to get the image on the ceiling above the crib would be to put the monitor in the crib. When I returned this monitor to Babies-R-Us the sales girl told me that no one is ever satisfied with that monitor and they almost all get returned. I bought the Constant Care 3000 2-way Communicator by Evenflo instead and it is WONDERFUL!!!! I can still talk to my son when I'm not in the room, with the 2 way communicator and the reception is clear as a bell!"
1,The monitor keeps us up more than the baby,"Actually most of the negative reviews we have read about this product are seem to be a bit understated. In order to hear the baby, the monitor must be turned up so high that the bedroom sounds like the proverbial evil scientists laboratory all night with all the buzzing and knocking. After spending a few nights with this monitor I suspect that Fisher Price has received government funding for research on a special sleep deprivation project on new parents. In short, if you want to be an irritable insomniac then this is the monitor for you. However if you enjoy your sleep at night then I would urge you to look elsewhere. My wife and I will be headed to any place that is open to get a replacement today!"
2,"Great, if you don't need a monitor","I wish that I had as much luck as others with this product.My baby loves the light show& soothing sounds but this isnot enough for me to keep this product. When the system is in use a ""heartbeat"" noise can be heard through the remote. This noise is loud enough that the baby can BARELY be heard through it (the base being only 12 inches away from her. I have been told by the manufacturer this is a common problem with this product. If I didn't need a monitot this product would be wonderful."
1,Terrible,We had high hopes for this monitor. We thought the features were great. The pictures on the ceiling the noise of the crickets. Then we actually tried to use it. The receiver made a horrible clicking noise and the reception was not clear at all. I could hardly hear my child. Also the soothe button did not work well at all. We returned it and bought the Fisher Price Vibrating Monitor instead. That is great. We actually bought two. That is my next review to do.
1,Hated this monitor,Yuck...this thing was so loud and horrible. I took it back after one horrible night.
1,Clicking and Buzzing,Do not buy this even if your life depended on it! The static and clicking noise coming from the reciever was just too much to handle. The stupid thing even cut out a number of time during the night. The only thing it is good for is a light show. But even that does not justify the cost.
1,possessed monitor,"I bought this monitor and the first night my son woke up crying in the middle of the night. There is a DEFECT in this monitor, when it is off and a loud pitch sound (CRYING) goes off near it, it turns on. All of the sudden anytime my sun cried or even talked the light show and music would go off. I called FP about this and they said that they know of the problem but have no way to fix it."
1,Total Waste of Money,"I really wish these reviews were available when I registered for this item. Unfortunately, we also did not use it until we moved our son into his bedroom and had long since gotten rid of the box. The clicking and static on the receiver are intolerable. The base is not stable and we have to keep it in his crib to be remotely effective (fine until he can actually grab it!). The soothing feature is ridiculous. I am actually on my way to the store to purchase another unit and throw this one in the trash as I wouldn't inflict it on anyone as a hand-me-down."
1,Disappointed!,"I put this moniter on my registery, and when I received it and set it up, I thought it was the cutest moniter in the world. I loved the soothing lights and sounds feature and the talk feature, but after the baby came home from the hospital, my opinion changed. I noticed that the moniter barely picked up the baby crying, and there is no way of turning off the music so you can just have the moniter going at night. At 2:30 in the morning, the baby wakes me up and then the loud music playing wakes up the rest of the family. Plus, the handset started making this really loud knocking noise, much louder than the regular noise a moniter makes. You can't even turn down the volume to make the knocking stop. The moniter is going back to the store today, and hopefully I'll find one that is more practical and works better."
3,"Bad monitor, Great light show.",I exchanged our original monitor (Graco - which is awsome) for this one because of the features. I found the light show was great. The monitor was terrible. I kept this monitor though because my son loved the light show and purchased back my original Graco monitor. Yep I have two monitors. This works best for us and I think this monitor is worth it's weight in gold for the light show. I DO NOT recommend using it as your only monitor! You are unable to hear your child. With my Graco I can hear him breathing from 3ft. away. With the Fisher-Price I could barely hear him crying.
2,Not so good,"I like the light show and the music. We can hear the babies fine, but there is a lot of interference on both channels (the next room away) and such a HORRIBLE clicking noise that comes from both the receiver and the base unit regardless of if we are using new batteries, old batteries or have it plugged in. I wish I wouldn't have thrown the package away before we used it for a while first."
1,"Great idea, miserable product","We were so excited about the concept of the light show, remote activation, and 2 way communication....but alas, the only part that worked correctly was the light show. As a monitor, we had to turn it up all the way just to hear our son cry, and the constant loud electrical pulsating snapped my nerves in about 5 minutes.....We tried 3 of these monitors, hoping it was just a defect in one, but unfortunately, the pulsating was there in all 3. I hope they improve the technology - I'd be right back to buy it!"
1,Problems galore!,"I bought this item mostly for the two-way communication feature (for my husband and I to use when on different floors, not for me to talk to the baby). My husband immediately noticed the clicking noise on the receiver. I had never had a baby monitor before and thought this was normal--based on all the reviews below, I guess it isn't!I had a problem that no one else seems to have had. . .not always, but several times, when I turned on the music/projector show, it acted like it had a short or a loose wire and cut in and out very quickly. Instead of being soothing. . it was scary! I took it back to the store and got a new one, but it did the SAME THING! So I took it back again and am looking for something else. Ironically, my neighbor who has twin girls that are just three weeks older than my son bought it and she had problems with it, too. She also returned it and got a second one that still had the problems.Don't buy this product--waste of money."
1,Disappointed,"My wife and I tried to do as much research as possible in an attempt to give our baby the best. Out of all the purchases for our new daughter, this item is definitely the worst and cheapest made product. There is a continuous clicking, humming sound that cannot be deleted no matter what channel you put the monitor on. There is also continuous feedback from outside interference- sometimes you may hear people talking. We live in a small neighborhood w/o a lot of air/mobile traffic etc, so we can't understand where the feedback comes from. The clicking sound is worst of all because it drowns out the babies noises/cries. The light show is ok but not a great picture. The soothing sounds, as someone else wrote, is very annoying and cheap. Please look into other brand names. This one is a dud. Good luck."
1,What a Waste!!,"I registered for this product and received it and was very happy and excited to finally try it out after all the TV adds that made it seem so great. Well they were all wrong! This monitor is the worst monitor. It has terrible static as well as a terrible loud buzzing sound. I was determinded that something must be wrong with the monitor so called Fisher Price and asked and come to find out that famous buzzing that everybody is complaining about is the motor that is in the base and it is being transmitted through the receiver. There is nothing that can be done about it. This keeps me and my husband up more then the baby crying, if we can even hear her! Terrible product big waste of money. Now we are on a search for another monitor that will do its job."
1,HORRIBLE NOISE! DO NOT BUY!!!,"My husband and I registered for this monitor when we were expecting our son. The Fisher-Price name and great features lead us to believe it was the best monitor on the market. Boy were we WRONG!!! The light show enamored us but the clicking noise, buzzing and constant interference (especially with our phone) drove us crazy!!! We immediately returned it and bought a new one thinking it was just a ""bad apple"". No such luck! We returned the second one and bought the less fancy Fisher-Price Sound 'N Lights monitor. It has NO interference, buzzing or clicking and it comes with two monitors-very helpful regardless of the size of your home! It's great not having to constantly unplug and move a receiver when you're moving from room to room cleaning or whatever. GET THE SOUND AND LIGHTS MONITOR INSTEAD!!!!!"
2,Disapointment,"After lots of research on monitors my husband and I chose this one for the extra gadgets like the light show, two way intercom etc. However, we too experienced after a few times using, an annoying pulsing noise that according to fisher price is always going to be there and is on all thier two way receptor monitors.Secondly the light show and music will go on automatically when my son exerts a high pitched noise AKA he screams. The problem is the lights stop after a few seconds which causes my son to scream louder until it comes back on. Now he has figured this out if he screams he quickly looks up to the ceiling to ensure he was successful, if no lights show he screams again. This as you can imagine is annoying and does not allow him to sooth himself back to sleep! Fisher Price said this was an ""added unintentional bonus"", not in my book!! I suggest a different monitor, unless you can get used to annoying pulsing and a possessed monitor which comes on and turns off by itself!"
1,Terrible monitor,If all monitors are made like this one I will have to sleep in my baby's room. There was so much static/interference in just the very next room I couldn't stand it. This item is going back and I will try another brand. If I could've rated it lower than one star I would have. DONT BUY THIS ITEM....YOU WILL BE SORRY.
2,"great concept, bad monitor","After reading other reviews, I realize that I'm not the only one with terrible reception. There is a constant clicking sound in the monitor. My complaint is the so-called ""soothing"". When you have the monitor set to ""soothe"" the light show or music or both comes on when the baby cries. The problem is, everytime it hears a loud noise it starts over again. In other words when a baby is crying, ""Waa waa waa"" The monitor stops and starts over and over again. This makes a frustrated baby even more frustrated and does not soothe them in any way! I like the light show but I think I will exchange for a good monitor and something else with a light show."
1,Poorly designed,"My dad bought this for our newborn son. I was so excited about all its neat features esp. the light show which my son enjoyed from day 1. However, as its main purpose as a monitor- it stinks! We could hardly hear my son who was in the other room due to this clicking noise. It didn't disappear even if we changed its location or outlet. As I read the other reviews, everyone complained about the same clicking noise. I was so disappointed since my son loved it. We had to return it and I purchased the 900 mHz vibrating monitor which was awesome. For a Fisher Price product, I was so disappointed since I always bought this brand due to the top-notch quality of their stuff. And I was a Fisher Price baby also."
1,2nd monitor and frustrated,"This monitor has a great projector and great advertised features. But don't let that fool you. The projector comes on by itself at any given time without the handset being on( so it must have a short in it.) The unit is very noisy, it has alot of static and makes an annoying clicking sound. It does not give a clear reception. My baby was crying the other night and I could not hear her through the clicking and the static. It keeps waking me through the night because of all the noise it makes. I do not reccommend this product and I am now looking for another monitor."
1,1 star because I could'nt give it zero!!!...,"This monitor is worthless!!! ....it is total junk. constant static. It looks like it would be great, but stay away...far away. We took ours back and got a a 1st years (or something like that) dual reciever model for half price..it works great. Save your money, babies cost to much to throw away money on junk like this!!!"
1,No use,"I could not use this monitor because it had a lot of static, and it kept making a knocking noise, so I could not hear my baby at all! Sometimes the soothing sounds would come on by itself, actually waking the baby. I bought a different monitor (the vibrating model) also by Fisher Price and it works great!"
1,Static Machine,"This monitor has alot of nice features but one feature it is missing is clarity.We have a quiet baby and a monitor thats noisy.There is a constant hissing and whirring when you turn it on, unlike the new 900mhz one we bought and can hear a pin drop in the babies room."
2,Horrible,I was so disappointed in this monitor. It is so noisy!!! The only good thing about this monitor is the soothing button that allows you to play music to the baby. I would not recommend this product.
2,new mom,"I bought this monitor for all the fancy features, but I ended up returning it the very next day. There was a constant clicking noise, that sounded just like a LOUD clock, which kept me up all night. I called the company and they said that this is a problem with all the monitors of this type. I ended up buying the Light and Sound monitor from the same company, and I'm very happy with it."
1,Not Worth It!!!,"I registered for and received this monitor and unfortunately I already threw the box away so I can not return it. I too heard a clicking &amp; buzzing noise that I could not get rid of. I do like the music &amp; light show but the &amp;quot;nature sounds&amp;quot; it plays sounds more like static. The biggest reasons I wanted this was to display the light show for my baby boy and to hear my him while he was sleeping in his crib but it only picked him up when he was crying which everyone can hear without the monitor! I was just going to keep it until I tried a unit that was simpler and $30 cheaper and the cheaper unit enabled me to hear even the faintest cooing noise he made. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS UNIT, you'd be better off buying a sound and light show machine in addition to a cheaper monitor."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$,"This product should be recalled!!! Within two weeks of bringing our son home, the light bulb burned out. We quickly discovered that the bulb can not be easily replaced. There was a constant clicking sound from the first day and within six weeks, the reception worsened to the point of pure static. The interference with our cordless phone was obscene -- far worse than the new monitor I've purchased since."
1,IT WILL WAKE YOUR CHILD,"My child is 6 months old and I have used this monitor for 4 months now. Yes it does make a clicking sound that my husband and I got used to. And the light show is great, it put my son back to sleep several times. The worst thing that could happen is for the monitor to wake your child up. For the past 3 weeks a loud static noise came through on the childs receiver. You don't notice it on your monitor it sounds like they just hit the crib with there hand. My son kept waking up in the middle of the night and I couldn't figure out why till one day I was in his room and I heard the static noise for myself and saw him jump and start to cry. It has gotten worse with each week. I hear it everytime I am in his room now."
1,Soothing Dreams Monitor,I registered and received this monitor as a gift. It makes a horrible buzzing noise. It has poor reception. After 2 months I noticed the 2 way option is not functional. It is not steady on its 3 legs and easily falls off the table. My son did like the light show and that is the only reason it gets 1 star. I wish I took it back sooner and got something worth $50.
2,All it needs is to be 2.4 Ghz,"This monitor is really entertaining BUT it does not work well as a monitor because of the loud static. It sounds like you are trying to tune into a radio station on AM. If you want it for entertainment it is great, but if you want it for a monitor don't waste your time buying it. The best monitor I have found after trying 3 different monitors is the 2.4 Ghz monitors. Ours works perfect!"
1,"Great Idea, Bad Monitor","The idea of this monitor sounded great; a light show, music, being able to talk back to the baby. However it has very bad reception. As does other monitors I have tried. Forget about trying to get your baby to sleep, I couldn't sleep with the constant fuzz sound and clicking. You can barely hear anything unless something is talking right into it...Spend your money on something more practical and more efficient like a set of intercoms..."
1,So sad this product does not do what it says,"The static that come from the base unit is awful, it is quiet for awhile, then makes a loud noise that scares my newborn to the point that she wakes up. The part that you keep with you clicks horribly, the first night we put our daughter in the nursery by herself, I had to wake up 5 times because the monitor was clicking so bad. I could not hear her at all, I ended up hearing her on my own down the hallway. Seriously reconsider another monitor. It is a shame that the ""basic"" parts don't work since the light show is a great tough."
1,Waste of Money,"As someone said, this does have it's problems. It falls over easily. Ours just turns on whenever it feels like it. My son says it's ""haunted"". The blast of static has happened over & over on it. It has woken the baby up several times. We've even gotten phone call conversations on it and they weren't from our phone! I could here voices coming out of my daughter's nursery, it was scary! The clicking noise is annoying on the receiver. The projector works but only if strapped to the baby's head so the picture comes out clearly. Save your money, not worth the cash."
1,What a waste!!,"I got this as a shower gift because I registered for it. I wish I had read the reviews before hand. I also wish I had saved the box so I could try to take it back. The soothing feature doesn't even turn on when my baby cries, and the static and interference make it impossible to sleep. I also can't hear the baby until he is crying hysterically. Kind of defeats the purpose. I sure wish I could trade it in for something else. After all this was not the cheapest monitor around. I just feel bad because my friend wasted all of that money on it..."
2,CLICK CLICK CLICK,"i have done everything to stop this horrible constant clicking noise on the hand set..sometimes it gets so loud i turn the volume down! it clicks constantly and you can hear the baby unless she is screaming loud to over power the clicking. i am dissappointed about this especially for the price of it. too bad, my daughter loves the light show. she is 2 1/2 months old but i cant take this clicking anymore!"
2,Soothing Dreams Monitor,"My daughter loved having the projections on the ceiling as a baby; so I was thrilled to find the projection/monitor for my son. Unfortunately, I ended up returning this item because the projector did not work after a few days, I changed the light bulb (which took forever, with all the unscrewing the tiny screws they use) but again a few days later it went out. I gave it a second chance with an even exchange, but the second projector did the same thing. I ended up returning it again and went with a separate monitor and projector which ended up costing less."
2,Soothing to who?,"This product is great for the light show, and the FX. But it is not very good as a monitor. The sound is static filled, and there is no way my husband or I could sleep with the receiver in our bedroom! We kept it because our daughter loves to watch the light show, but had to buy a second monitor so that we could hear her. I wouldn't recommend for anything other than a nursery toy."
2,Don't be deceived!,"I loved the description of this product and did not take the time to research it. Yes, my baby loves the light show (I personally have not had difficulty with positioning it) and I like both the night sounds and the songs. BUT the two way doesn't work on ours, there is intermittent loud clacking no matter how we adjust it, and there is a constant hum no matter where we place the receiver. We have been really disappointed with this product. I wish I had kept the box so we could return it!"
1,I agree - don't waste your money,"We registered for this monitor and thought that the projector and music features would be nice.However, we can't get beyond the constant humming heard in the monitor, which sometimes makes it difficult to hear the baby.Definitely a waste of money."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!,"We got this as a gift and could not wait to use it. We were very happy with how well the remote worked for the night-light/music and light show. Our baby loves to fall asleep to music and we could be in the other room to turn it on for her. But, as a monitor we could never hear her over the loud click. We returned it for a new one and it happened again. We called Fisher Price they told us it's ment to do that so you know the unit is on. Then one night our friends came over with their baby and monitor(another product) and we were shocked how clear it was. So we returned ours and got the 900 MHz Vibrating Monitor. This one is very good! Now we play a cd for her each night and she is fine."
1,NOT a good buy,"I must say i was very disapointed in the quality of this monitor. We had a horrible time trying to actually hear my son over the buzzing and clicking. The ONLY good thing i can say is that the light show is great. My son loved it, so we purchased the lullaby dream show from tomy to replace that part of the monitor. I really did expect better quality from fisher price."
1,Horrible Monitor,"This is a bad choice for a monitor. For the price that this monitor cost, I expected it to pick up my baby and rock him back to sleep! However, it didn't work as a monitor and was impractical as a light show.ALl i heard was static on the monitor. I couldn't even hear the baby above the static. So, we quit using it as a monitor.Light and sound show....it's eerie....it goes off all by itself...so we have to leave it unplugged or it wakes the baby. We use it once in a great while as a light show. And to do that, we have to balance it on the crib so the baby can see it.I would highly recommend another monitor...especially one a little cheaper."
2,TERRIBLE NOISE!,I am not happy with this monitor. It makes a loud clicking noise through the receiver and has made a loud static noise that even woke up my baby. I was told by the company that the clicking noise is a trait of this particular monitor. The only thing I do like is the light show. I definatly do not recommend this one.
1,"I like Fischer Price, however,,,","I put this baby monitor on my registry without really looking at other monitors because I thought the light show would be interesting for the baby to look at. I really like Fischer Price products, however, I would not recommend this particular monitor to a new parent. We never took the opportunity to use the light show and there is a constant hum that drones from the monitor. There are also sudden bursts of loud static from the receiver portion that is kept in the baby's room.I went to Toys R Us to purchase another monitor and ended up purchasing a Sony monitor that I am extremely happy with. There are 27 channel settings on it, it has excellent clarity and it is super quiet. I wish the Sony monitor was listed online so that I could write a review, I would give it 5 stars!"
1,It's to bad!!...,"It has a great light show, the sounds are terrific, but between the static, and the constant clicking noise, and the sudden burst of some horrable static, that all of a sudden comes from know where that wakes everyone in the house, I say bring it back, it's just to bad they try to improve these monitors to make them better, and end up making them so bad that you don't want to purchase them any more."
2,Not a great monitor,"My son LOVES the light show that this monitor puts on the ceiling, and the cricket sounds seem to relax him. My problem with this monitor is that there is a constant clicking noise in the receiver, and the main unit has VERY loud bursts of static. It is very diificult to hear my son over the noise that the unit makes. I was told that the clicking noise in the receiver was beacause of a low battery, but I have taken the battery out and just plugged it in and it still clicks. Another problem is that when the receiver is not plugged in the batteries die very quickly. Overall I would not recommend this monitor."
1,Frustrating and un-reliable,"Constant static clicking noise heard from remote end when on. Static feedback sound from the recever was heard, keeping the baby awake. From remote end baby could barely be heard when reciving end was right next to him. Light display on cieling was okay but almost too light to capture baby's attention."
1,worthless monitor,It has great sounding features. Mine has the same annoying clicking sound along with a constant hum that is really unbearable. I am tossing mine and getting anything else. Im extremely dissapointed.
2,"Feedback, static, not flexible enough","I was disappointed with this monitor on several levels. The first complaint is that on the reciever end, I heard a continual beat of static. It goes on and on. Then after about 20 minutes or so, feedback bursts across my daughters end, waking her from her peaceful slumber. I really enjoyed being able to talk to her from downstairs. That is why we bought this one. The images that project onto the ceiling didn't go on our ceiling. We have angled walls and the projecter just wasn't as flexible as we needed. It should go not only back and forth, but side to side as well. Love the soothe mechinism. Hate the draw backs."
2,Spend a little less and get a better quality monitor,"I loved this monitor when we 1st got it. It was nice because of the music & the lights. Then I realized there was no volume control for the music. My son was born a year ago today and a month ago the handset stopped working properly! Lately the static has gotten so bad its been almost impossible to use. Someone else said something about clicking constantly, which is VERY annoying. I am getting ready to throw mine away & buy a new one!"
1,Ready to throw it out the window at night!!,I have used this monitor for 7 months and I'm ready to throw it out the window at night. My baby sleeps through the night but I don't because of this darn monitor. It makes a loud clicking noise which I just got use to and now everynight we have to change channels twice because it makes another loud noise. Once we change the channel it is fine but that only lasts for a hour and then we have to change it back. I am done with this montior I'm going out to buy a different one.
1,This Monitor is Possessed!,"I thought that it is my duty to write in about this monitor. We bought it in spite of all the bad reviews that I read about on the website. I was intrigued by the light show that it projects on the ceiling. First of all, the feedback is terrible, and with all the clicking you can't even hear the baby! One night, I was awaken at 3am with the sound of Beethoven in the next room! I walked in to the nursery to find our baby wide awake with the music from the monitor blaring and a light show on her ceiling! It look me over an hour to get her back to sleep. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this!"
1,If you live in a townhouse do not buy this!,We recieved this monitor as a shower gift and it is horrible! We live in a townhouse and the static is so loud that you cant even hear the baby crying.
2,can't hear my baby!,I bought this for my 2nd baby because I thought the light show and soothing sounds would be great. But all you can hear is annoying clicks and can barely hear my baby even with the volume on high. I am returning it and getting another Lights & Sound monitor that I currently use. It's less expensive and you can hear your baby breathing which is more important than a light show!
3,A so-so monitor,"We have a lot of issues with the sound quality. I hear tons of static and a constant tapping noise. The piece of the monitor that you carry around also falls down easily. It needs a sturdier flatter surface. The light show is less than entertaining. The monitor looks good, sounds bad."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We got this for all of the features that it had, but were very disappointed with it. The parent receiver had so much static, and a constant humming and clicking, that after about an hour we gave up. We brought the baby back into our bedroom in his bassinette and returned the monitor the next day. Don't waste your money on this one! The Fisher-Price vibrating monitor is $10 less and SO much better!"
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"THIS IS THE MOST HORRIBLE MONITOR EVER. THE STATIC IS SO LOUD, I COULDN'T EVEN HEAR MY BABY CRYING. I TRIED PLAYING AROUND WITH IT, BUT IT'S USELESS. THE OTHER FEATURES ARE GREAT, BUT IT FAILS WHEN IT COMES TO IT'S MAIN FUNCTION."
1,Super Static!,I couldn't hear a thing with this monitor because of all of the static! I returned it for the First Years monitor. MUCH better - and it comes with rechargable batteries! Don't be fooled by the lights and gizmos!!!
1,Transmitter makes 1 Hz clicking noise,"This monitor is simply too noisy. I turned off all the RF in the home (wireless network, cordless phone, ..) and still the transmitter was sending clicks/pops about once a second. Seems like a design problem with the unit based on other similar feedback listed here .."
1,Very Very Disappointed,"I bought this monitor because of the light and music show. I have never used either one of the features. As a matter of fact I don't use the monitor at all anymore. It became so annoying and unreliable, I have returned it for another one. I put a battery in the monitor the first night so I could take it in the living room, and bedroom without the hassle of plugging it in and out. The battery was DEAD in 1 night and it was clicking so loudly, I had to turn it off. In the middle of the night while, the baby, my husband and myself were in a sound sleep, the music and light show went off 2 times, startling all three of us awake. I have also found it has some serious static and interference. I DO NOT recommend anyone to purchase this. It is an ... monitor and it is not worth the money."
2,Not What I thought it would be!,"Registered as a gift. I thought it would be great, with the music and light display. But the receiver ticks (worse when it is on the battery)and the main unit will occasionally get this loud burst of static in the baby's room. I will keep it soley for the light display, but I have purshased the Safety 1st Crystal Clear monitor ... and it is 100% better. Sometimes you can't trust because it costs more means it is better."
1,stop..read this before you think about buying this moniter!,"my husband and I thought this moniter would be great with all its soothing features for our daughter...so we registered for it. What we found is this moniter is terrible! All you hear when the moniter is on is this horrible clicking noise.. and the volume has to be pretty much maxed to even hear this! When you do hear your baby its hard to tell if it is a cry or just a cough! The soothing dream features are great my daughter loves the projection, Its a great TOY...but we wanted a MONITER! Unfortunally, we can not return it for another since the box was thrown away by well meaning relatives who cleaned for me while I was in the hospital. So we are stuck with this one untill we have extra money for a new one ..untill then I depend on my hearing which has inproved 100% since I cant depend on my moniter to help out!"
1,Not so good! by a mom in New Jersey,"Like the other reviews, the bulb blew before my daughter was even born!, the music will start playing by itself (I thought a ghost was turning it on), and there is a clicking noise and some static from the receiver. I threw the box away before testing this monitor out, so now I'm stuck with it. I would not recommend this monitor. It sounds like a great product because of all the neat features, it just doesn't work."
2,do not buy,"We got this monitor as a gift. It has a ticking noise that is annoying, sometimes you can't hear your baby crying and sometimes the music will start playing or it will suddenly come on with a loud static noise. Sometimes it wakes my boys up with the sudden loud static noise. The only thing I like is the lights on the ceiling and the music."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited when I received this product at my baby shower! Once I used it my feelings changed. We get so much static, humming and pulsing that it has to be turned down so that we can sleep. The monitor also starts playing music when the nursery is quiet, waking the baby. I tried to return it to Fisher Price but they would not take it because it technically is not defective. I do like the light show and am looking forward to using it when my daughter is a little older."
1,Horrible clicking noise,"This monitor looked like it was going to be really good. I really liked how it had the projector and the soothing music/noises, however, those features are not worth the horrible clicking noise you have to listen to while trying to monitor your child. I called Fisher-Price and told them what was happening and they told me that the reason this was happening was because it was a two-way monitor. In other words you can talk to your child through the receiver. They told me that they do make a different model of this monitor that does not have the talk feature that does not make this horrible clicking noise. Fisher-Price was very helpful and they will let you send this monitor back for a refund voucher for other Mattel/Fisher-Price items. I definately do not think this monitor is worth the $50 it costs. I will definately be sending this monitor back to Fisher-Price for a refund voucher and will be buying a different monitor!"
1,I have that clicking sound too!,"I bought this for my daughters nursery and my monitor has the same clicking sound that others are talking about. Until reading other reviews I thought I just had a bad one. I love the light show and keep it just for that, but never used it as an actual monitor. I never tried to take it back, waited to long, but it sounds like they are all like this."
2,Constant clicking,"I registered for this monitor for my shower and was so excited to get it. My daughter (four months old) absolutely loves to watch the lights. I don't use the music, I play a classical music cd instead. However, the monitor part of it is HORRIBLE!! Our bedroom is only three feet from my daughter's and I cannot hear through the monitor. There is a constant clicking sound and a high-pitched buzzing. When my daughter does make a noise, I can't even hear it through the monitor because of the loud clicking. We haven't used this since we received it (as a montior), just as a light show. I would definitely recommend buying a different monitor and then buy one of those new &quot;light show&quot; toys that are available from many different companies."
1,All Around Bad,"We went through 2 of these monitors before giving up. The first one's ""soothing dreams"" mechanism broke, while also being static ridden. The 2nd one seemed worse on the static, so we took it back. Don't buy this."
3,Needs improvement,"My baby fell in love with the light show, so when the light bulb burnt out, I bought several more to replace it. The light bulb would burn out within 5 minutes, so I returned the unit for another. This one lasted a week before it burnt out, and again when replaced the new bulbs would burn out within 5 minutes. The static is also pretty bad - we get a loud ""truck"" noise about every hour or so, which wakes the baby up. I had to go into the room after she fell asleep and turn the monitor off - so much for monitoring.I also went out and got another toy that does just the light show - she loves it!"
1,TERRIBLE TERRIBLE,"Apparently if you have a cordless phone in your house (and I don't know many that don't) you can't use this product. I called Fisher Price regarding this issue and this is what they told me. She wanted me to unplug my phones, move it away from the windows and play with the volume and when all else failed she told me that it could be because of my neighbors cordless phones. SO I followed her instructions and moved it right into the garbage. Get a different monitor."
1,Too much static!,"While the walkie-talkie feature of this baby monitor is nice, I am very disappointed in this product due to a static issue. Nearly every 15 minutes, a burst of static (loud enough to wake a sleeping baby) emits from the base monitor unit (in the nursery). I am going to attempt to return the product to Fisher Price."
1,"Good idea, terrible product","I registered for this monitor mainly due to the Fisher Price brand - thinking that the quality would be good and that the biggest difference between monitors was the features. Boy, was I WRONG! I agree with other reviewers - the clicking noise is not only non-stop, it is quite loud and annoying. We also never did get the ""talk to your baby"" feature to work AT ALL. The light show was nice, but not worth all the other drawbacks and honestly, the ""soothing sounds"" (mainly cricket chirps) were pretty annoying and not soothing in any way.We returned ours to BRU yesterday and came home with the Sony Baby Call Monitor (also available from sony.com) - what it lacks in ""features"", it more than makes up for in clarity and range! Although, our baby hasn't arrived yet, we tested it with whispers and it's FANTASTIC! A much better quality product (for the same price)!!"
1,click-click-click (that's all you hear at night),"OK, I thought this would be great to have because I could talk to my son if I needed to....well when I plugged it up in my room and turned it on, all I heard was click, click, click ALL NIGHT LONG!! I thought something was wrong so I call Fisher Price....that's what it does the lady said because it has two way communication. ""that's how you know it's working""...I don't know about you, but I can't sleep with click, click, click in my hear all night long!!! It also occasionally pops really loud....loud enough to wake up my son! Bad choice...taking it back and getting a different one ASAP."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I was excited when I first bought this monitor because of all the features it has. Well, first of all in order for the baby to even see the light show the monitor has to be very close to the crib and it has no crib attachments. I ended up having to put it on a shelf and angle the monitor just right and brace it up just so that the picture would show above the crib. Also, it has a nightlight. You might as well have a separate nightlight because it's not enough light for ANYTHING. I can hear my baby well in the monitor....that is when the monitor doesn't start clacking. It has a loud clacking noise that starts for no reason and it doesn't stop on either channel. Even when it's not clacking it has a constant loud hum. I will be taking this monitor back soon. Please don't waste your money!"
1,Do not buy this for a monitor!,"We bought this monitor before we read the reviews, because of the neat features. The hand reciever makes a horrible ticking noise when plugged in and you cannot hear a voice speaking loudly into the mcirophone on the base. Even with batteries in the reciever it makes a buzzing noise and you still cannot hear a thing coming through the mic. We were very disappointed, and are returning it to the store."
1,Disappointed,I received this monitor as a shower gift and it is a great idea (i.e. ability to start a light and music show remotely)- however we have found several things wrong with it to the point I am considering looking for a new model. 1. The monitor does not stand up well - we have knocked it over several times in the middle of the night. 2. The volume dial on the monitor is difficult to turn and has contributed to the monitor falling over whenewver we try to adjust it. 3. It makes a clicking noise when it is on. 4. Every once in awhile there is this loud blast of static coming from the nursery monitor that has woken up the baby on more than one occasion. I would recommend that people look at some other monitors before deciding on this one.
1,Great idea bad aounds,"While I think that Fisher-Price had a great idea while putting this monitor together. Something is not quite right about a monitor that receives a horribly annoying clicking\static sound on the receiver, no matter where it is used.We had a cheaper model of an unnamed Monitor that went bad on us. We decided to get this unit to sooth our baby with the video, sounds and my wife's voice. Unfortunately the interference was so loud we could barely here anything out of the monitor when we tested it. My wife talking into the monitor produced a extremely muffled choppy sound on the other end. We tested this monitor from all different locations, including our house, my mother in-laws house and the store, with two different units, when we tried to swap the unit for a new one. You would think that Fisher-Price would know this is happening and fix it before putting this product on any shelf."
1,disappointed,"The lightshow on the ceiling is captivating and my son enjoyed it...but as a monitor we found this very disappointing. The child's unit produced large squals of static often that were startling enough to wake my son at times. The parent's unit had a great deal of static and it did not register my son's cries as it should. I was outside once and heard him crying from his room before it ever registered on the monitor. I also found the parent's unit to be bulky to hold and I was always afraid I would push the ""talk"" button when picking it up. I must say that Fisher Price's Customer Service dept is excellent. I was allowed to return the monitor for a full refund (no receipt or original packaging). I am currently extremely happy with Clear and Crisp (something like that) by The First Years."
1,Not very pleased!!,"I thought this would be a wonderful monitor with all of the great features. I was wrong! The soother (projector) feature of the monitor turned itself on all the time and it was also extremely easy to bump the button on the parents handset and turn it on accidentally. My other complaint is how noisy it was. Constantly, the monitor would make a horrible scratching sound in the middle of the night and scare both me and my baby. The handset also made a clicking noise on several occasions. My last complaint about the handset is that it is too bulky to clip on to your pocket and carry around. I have talked with two other parents who used this monitor and all of us have returned it for another brand. I do not suggest this monitor."
2,Great idea but falls short,"If you remove the idea of using this for a baby monitor then it's great. My new baby loves the sound and light show. The monitoring function, though, leaves a lot to be desired. Too much static to be of any use. In it's defense, it has been my experience that pretty much all baby monitors that use normal walkie-talkie frequencies do not work. Think about it, as a kid we all used walkie-talkies and they didn't work beyond about 15 feet. But they were cheap and we were kids and didn't know better. These baby monitors are no different. If you need a monitor either look into higher prices ones that run at higher frequencies (900MHz or 2.4GHZ) that may actually work or buy one at a garage sale. Don't ever buy a baby monitor new... unless it's just for the sound and light show."
2,"Great Idea, Bad Product","I think the idea was great. But, there is A LOT of noise on the parent end of the monitor and I didn't think it picked up the sounds of the baby very well. The lights do turn on when baby cries and the walkie talkie is great too. I would just buy a decorative lamp for the baby and save my money. The 2 star rating is for the light display only, not the monitoring itself."
2,Return to sender!,"Ok, this has to be the worst monitor because of how much static and noise it causes!! I called fisher price and the lady who answered the call said if I have a cordless phone or computer in the house it wont work and you will hear the static, who doesnt have at least one cordless phone in there home now a days. I unpluged everything and I still heard the static. All that is good is the music and the light and the light show to say the least!! Never throw away boxes, big mistake I made because this would be returned!"
1,NOT IMPRESSED,"We received this monitor as a gift. The lights and music were fun, but the monitor did not work at all. There was a loud buzzing and clicking noise in the background and we couldn't even hear the baby crying. We took the monitor back and exchanged it, thinking that maybe it was just that one. Sorry to say it was that type of monitor."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,I wanted this monitor because of all the features and I received it as a shower gift. This monitor has so much static that you cannot hear anything. We can be downstairs and the monitor does nothing but buzz and no lights flash and we can hear our son screaming upstairs in his crib. It also makes a constant buzzing and clicking noise that will drive you insane! And the monitor that is in the baby's room will make loud bursts of static that will wake him/her right up. The light show barely works and the music does not stay on long enough to soothe your baby. It also will scare you to death when the music starts playing for no reason. Please--do not waste your money and return it ASAP.
2,love the music & lights...hate the clicking,"We received this monitor as a shower gift and I couldn't wait to hook it up. the minute the lights and music went on our daughter was mesmerized. She loved it. I positioned it on the dresser (propped into a position where the projector could actually project over the crib) and went to bed. When we turned the monitor on we hear this clicking noise. I tried changing channels and that didn't work. so, we unplugged it and set up the one that we picked up at a garage sale for $5. there has to be better monitors out there that are clear and have a good range on them."
5,Why all the complaints???,"I don't understand why so many reviews are bad! I just received this, and I love it! It was so easy to put together, i didn't even have to ask my hubby, it sure seems sturdy enough,and if somebodys zipper broke, it could be because you didn't have the rods all the way pushed in like they should be! I have 2 med. sized cats, and they took to it right away, and if you put something small on top of the tent, chances are they won't jump up on it..and even if they did, I really can't see it being a problem... The best part is seeing all the litter my kitties are kicking up that normally would have landed on my floor is now in the tent and I don't have to sweep up everyday. My advice, buy it., it is soooooooo worth it ^..^"
1,Horrible Product,"The only reason why I am giving it 1 star is because it won't let me give it a 0 star rating. The plastic rods they use to hold the tent together are of exceptionally poor quality and they broke in a few weeks. I do admit that my cats did sit on it occasionally, but hey, they are cats, they aren't smart enough to know that the tent would break! Apparenlty, the geniuses who desgined these tents are not much smarter than my cats either. I am sure I can make a sturdier support structure using Legos!"
2,Not like the original!,"We purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong. This one arrived with cracked support rods (different material than original) and the plastic is stiff and brittle. Contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement. After waiting quite some time, seller advised that their supplier was out of these and issued a credit. Nothing wrong with the seller other than slow on the follow up - the product is just not the quality of the original models."
2,Pieces Don't fit together,"Some of the rods only fit loosely with each other. Also, the bottom of the tent nearly broke the framework. I had to leave the bottom of the tent off... ONLY reason why I would recommend buying this is its size. I have a huge litter box and no other tent can fit it."
4,CAT TENT,"IT IS VERY NICE, EXCEPT IT IS HARD TO ZIPPER, THEN ZIPPER COME ON DONW.OTHER WISE VERY NICE. :)"
1,Do not recommend this product.,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. The pipes are very cheap and thin. They do not click together or even firmly adhere when assembling. Besides that, the vinyl lining was measured incorrectly and the two pieces (top and bottom) would not fit together in order to zip closed. I sent it back immediately."
1,Bad news,I bought three of these...NO GOOD...the first time the cat decided to jump up on top of this the frame broke and there is no way to put it back together. After loosing all three of these to the cats jumping up I gave up.The frame is a joke.
1,Very disappointed!,"It was difficult to install the polls. they broke as I tried to stretch them inside the tent to open them up. I have put together pop up tents with much more ease and stability. I had to leave one pole out and to use electrical tape to secure the cracked poles.In addition to that, the littermaid unit did not fit well. I had purchased the multicat littermaid and the unit barely fit inside. I can not easily add new litter as it will not pull in and out. I also had to cut the front panels with a razor to flip up the entire front panels in order to pull the unit out even an inch.No way will I be able to take it apart to clean the plastic or the litter that has fallen to the floor of the tent. I need a tent, but this one stinks!!"
1,Not Worth It!!!,"The zipper broke the first time we put this together. We managed to fix it, but we'll have to be careful everytime we take out the littler box for cleaning. The old littermaid cover we had was made much better."
2,Not waterproof,"Oh, I was so sad when this didn't work! It seemed like the answer to my problem. I have a cat that marks his litterbox. so, I bought the tent hoping that even if he sprayed, it would be contained.For the first two weeks, everything was great. But when I moved the tent to clean the floor, I saw that the urine had seeped through the tent's bottom and stained my hardwood floor.I still haven't gotten the smell completely out of the floor, and on top of that, the floor laminate is ruined."
3,It's huge!!!,"The tent is incredibly big, I own a fairly small litter tray for my kitty, and well, it ocupies about a third of the tent itself.It makes a fairly good job at keeping odors under control and keeping sand contained. Depending on your cat's sloppyness you'll have to clean it about once every week.It has a very tall top, and putting it together is rather tough, you have to pull tightly for the top cover to fit with the zipper at the bottom cover. Besides that, it is worth the money and the wait."
1,Impossible to zip,"LitterMaid Cat Privacy TentI couldn't get the two tent pieces close enough together for zipping.So I disassembled the poles, zipped the two pieces together, then reassembled the poles inside the zipped tent. I couldn't get every pole attached, but the tent is standing and I use it.The tent flaps make it very difficult to empty the litter tray.I used a pair of scissors to make some cuts in the tent opening to fix this problem. Much better.Now that it's standing, I like that that it is containing the cat litter. But I woudln't buy it again."
2,Not so great,"I ordered this item to go along with the litter box. I have an apartment and have to keep the box in a common area so the idea of the tent sounded like a good way to ""hide"" the cat box.Problem is, the vinyl tent does not fit the frame. Trying to zip the bottom and top half of the tent together was a 30 minute ordeal of pulling and stretching. Now that it's together, the zipper is starting to unravel.Good idea, poor execution.Haven't had much luck with their litter boxes either."
5,This thing is great.,"I ordered this tent as a replacement for the one I had previously that broke because my cat kept jumping on top of it. The plastic rods inside broke in the old one and I could not find where I could order just those rods, so I ended up ordering a new tent. It's the same as the first, great! I was even more pleased to find that Amazon was less expensive that 5 other places I had visited previously. I'm a very happy customer."
2,hard to believe this was MADE for the littermaid box,"I ordered the tent a few weeks ago.... and am surprised how poorly it works with the Littermaid box it was made to fit over. If you have the tent over the box, it doesn't allow the litter receptacle to work - the hinges open up and get stuck on the sides of the tent and you have to manually keep shutting it. So I cut the front of the tent off (the end with the flaps that were supposed to velcro to the sides). This helped a little, but basically we have to have the whole receptacle end of the box slid out of the tent and in plain sight. I would not recommend this tent to others."
4,LitterMaid Tent,"The LitterMaid Privacy tent for the LitterMaid catbox is a great thing. It helps keep the litter in a confined area, if you have a messy cat. :)"
1,Very Flimsy,Extremely flimsy construction. The plastic support pieces won't hold up to the stress required to get the top and bottom zipped together. One of my supports bent and broke while trying to get it zipped. It seems like the cover is just a tiny bit too small for the frame.
3,Littermaid,"This product is a great idea and is our third one, however, the materials do not hold up long term. The quality of the motor and components an sub-par. We have only one cat and this machine has a hard time operating properly for a long period of time. I have a few ideas for the manufacturer. Metal components and bigger motors! I would pay more for a better machine, but you don't really make one."
3,Not what I expected,"It does the job of containing tracking of litter, but it is very hard to zip up at the bottom. Scooping is also difficult with the tent on. I just have to leave it unzipped and take the tent off every time I scoop."
1,Littermaid cat privacy tent,The nylon zipper pulls apart. The controls are difficult to see without taking the whole item apart. I am not happy with the product and would not recommend it.
4,Good for a limited time,"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.Pros: provides coverage, privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control. Does not retain odor.Cons: Fits too tight, which causes the zipper to break and fail. Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily. COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.Overall, I have owned several of these. Eventually, they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail. That's really all I can say about it."
2,"Great after replacement: was original a second, reject, or knock-off?","I contacted the manufacturer who immediately shipped me a replacement. This replacement fit and worked perfectly! No trouble zipping the two parts of the replacement together. It now works exactly as advertised and is great at helping contain litter to a smaller area, as well as hiding the litter box. Frame assembled easily and correctly. Note: original purchase was defective. Tent parts appeared fine, but when I tried to connect the top and bottom sections using the zipper, it was impossible. The pieces were cut too small; the gap between the two sections was over an inch. When I pulled and pulled to make the two sides of the zipper connect, it barely touched. When I finally got them connected, I could only pull the nylon zipper closed for a couple of inches before the teeth began to separate again. Eventually, the entire zipper pull mechanism came off the teeth track."
2,Lucky I was just trying to replace an old tent,"Once the stakes were assembled correctly, the tent would't fit around the stakes, it was to tight to zip, and the zipper broke in trying. The corners seemed to not fully extend. I was replacing an old tent I had that my plump kitty broke when climbing on top of it, so I just ended up using the stakes and putting the old tent back up with the new stakes. If I hadn't had the old tent, I would've had to replace the product completely, after it already took several weeks to receive it in the mail."
2,Could be better,"This should be about a $10 item. It has good points, but is definitely not worth $30. After assembling the frame I found that the tent was undersized and there was no way I could zip the bottom and top together. I thought maybe I had not assembled the frame tight enough so I went back through each connection to make sure I had all the connectors and poles tight. In the process one of the connectors broke. However, I am still able to use the tent with one corner broken (this is actully the only reason I can zip it). It would have also been better had their been better access to the litter box, maybe through the top or a bigger opening on the front. It's sort of a pain to take it apart everytime you want to change the waste. container or add litter."
2,I paid $30 for this????,"I was astounded at the poor quality when I first purchased the Littermaid tent. Then again, comparing this to the littermaid cat box itself it seems that the company banks on having their products break so the customer will (buy another and) get a replacement. Putting the tent together was a nightmare, as the zipper broke and the tubing seemed too big for the plastic liner. The only good thing I can say is that we have had the tent for about a year and a half and my (big-boned) 15 lb cat makes the top of the tent a regular hang out spot. I won't tempt fate by saying it hasn't b-r-o-k-e-n yet."
1,"Ugly, flimsy","The tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper, that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods. The problem lies in the structure, which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat. If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do, the frame will break quickly.If you're minimally handy, you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints (they're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store). If your cat is heavy and a climber, I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all, unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid, this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it's worth."
3,"Good idea, poor execution, but modifiable","I've had one of these for approx 5 years now. I use it over a normal jumbo-sized cat pan. As everyone else has said, the plastic posts are junk. All of mine broke. Because I really like the tent itself, we rebuilt a wood frame using 1"" x 1"" posts and ""L"" brackets, which has worked great and made the whole thing much sturdier. We also cut a piece of 1/4"" light wood to put over the top, because it is impossible to keep cats from jumping on top. The cats are fine with the tent and once we fixed the design flaws it has worked perfectly. The little darlings still manage to spew litter out of the front, but it's better than 360 degrees of litter scatter."
1,Zipper is Defective,"This was my second replacement. The tent is smaller than the interior plastic structure. When you go to zipper it, the zipper breaks and the tent becomes useless. This happend to me three times so the product must be defetive."
1,Zipper breaks easily,"The zipper on this product has itty-bitty teeth. The zipper actucally seperated during intial set up.Also, the vertical tubes are too long to allow the ten to fit over the frame of tubes.It does keep the litter dust in but you have to modify the kit right out of the box."
3,Littermaid privacy tent review,Overall good but corner sewing construction poor. Ripped while putting together but still functional.
3,"Tight fit, contains mess well","I'm not fond of the littermaid box as it jams too easily, but the tent does a good job of containing thrown litter (I have home run hitting cats. Putting it together is a little difficult as it's made a little too tight. I couldn't get it to zip together until I made sure all the poles were as tight as possible in the corners. It becomes a pain when the box gets jammed and needs cleaning, necessitating frequent unzipping and zipping."
1,Frame for the Littermaid,The tent is great and does help keep litter down. The frame is cheap and cats do like to hop up on top of the tent plus you can't buy just an extra frame anywhere that I have found. I think they did this on purpose so that many people would just buy another tent. I have made one myself from small but very sturdy PVC pipe. If you are good with your hands its easy.
1,LitterMaid Tent,This tent does not fit the newer models of LitterMaid automatic litter boxes. I have yet to hear whether or not there is a privacy tent that will fit.
1,Total crap!,I bought this to go with the litter box and it was horrible. It was a pain to put together and it didn't even fit the frame properly. I had it no more then 2 months before I had to throw it away because it fell apart and ripped.
1,Cheaply made,"I purchased 3 of these. Put together the first one and before it was totally put together one of the plastic tabs/braces broke! The cover is too tight of a fit over the plastic frame and when zipping the two sections of the cover together over the frame, a tab/brace didn't stand up to the pressure. NOT happy about this. Trying to decide on whether to return the remaining two, or contact the manufacturer. Not worth the money spent."
1,What a waste of money!!,"The plastic pieces for the base of the tent are flimsy and cheap. The tent would not zip together over the tent base. When I tried to zip up the tent two of the supports broke at the front of the tent and it won't stay up. There is no way to fix the broken pieces and the tent will not zip up together. What a waste of money! Don't waste your money buying this LitterMaid Cat Privacy Tent, it will break into pieces within the first 5 minutes."
1,Not for Litter Maid Elite,"This tent is AWFUL! We ordered this for our Litter Maid Elite and after 45 minutes of trying to get the zipper zipped on this ""tent"", we come to realize the litterbox will not fit in this thing and cannot be taken out easily for cleaning. Forget about being able to unzip to clean the box- the zipper does not come together in some places so you have the chance of litter making its way onto the floor.I always read reviews and try to not pay too much attention to the negative reviews, but this thing truly deserves no stars insted of the one I had to give it."
1,Expensive piece of junk,"The things that broke before it was done being assembled:1. The cheap plastic frame2. The cheap flimsy zipper3. The cheap plastic canopyI wish I had kept the box so I could have returned it. In addition to it being cheap and flimsy, once it is on, it is so difficult to clean the cat litter box that it renders an automatic litter box useless. Just cleaning out the litter box would be a backbreaking, messy task. A cardboard box placed over a litter box with a hole in it would be a better investment than this junk."
1,Don't buy littermaid privacy tent,This item broke the 1st day I used it! The plastic frame broke.don't waste your money. Made very cheap.
2,"Works okay, but poorly constructed","The tent was very difficult to assemble. The vinyl barely stretches over the plastic pieces. It was extremely difficult to zip, and one of the plastic pieces broke during the process. We super-glued it back together & finally got the thing assembled. Now it works fine and does a fairly good job of keeping litter contained within the tent. Just wish it were a bit more sturdy and easier to assemble. I excepted a better product for the price."
2,Littermaid cat privacy tent,Doesn't fit the littermaid box...waste of money! Thinking of getting another litter system entirely! Very disappointed in the quality of the product.
1,The zipper broke with the first use,The tent was advertised to fit a littermaid elite. It took three people to close the zipper on the tent. I hate it...
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing!! The instructions that came with my package were useless and confusing. I found a different set online that were more helpful. Some of the connectors are too small for the poles and with one wrong move they pop out. The plastic cover does not even come close to fitting the frame. I cannot zip it up at all. There is at least a 2"" gap!!! Very disappointed in this product!!"
1,"Cheap Construction, Doen Not Fit Elite Model","Bought the privacy tent recently. The description said that it fit LitterMaid boxes and most others. This is not correct. We have a LitterMaid Elite which will not fit inside the tent. While assembling the tent, three of the very cheap plastic rods, designed to be used as the frame, snapped and were unusable without repair. The top section is connected to the bottom section with a zipper. The zipper does not seem very sturdy at all. Bottom line is that you get what you pay for. At least we are only out $25."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","I got this tent and one pole was already broken. I should have known this was not a good thing. Over time I used more and more super glue and tape to hold it together. I eventually had to give up. And the cats weren't even sitting on it.I liked the idea though, could be used with any litter box really."
1,LitterMaid Cat Privacy Tent - DEFECT -,"Littermaid item LM100 arrived in good condition, however, while assembling the Privacy Tent per directions, it was apparent the vinyl cover would not fit the assembled frame without excessive stretching. The two vinyl sections had a 1/4 inch gap between the zipper strips. Calling LitterMaid customer service (NOT)was a waste of time. The service rep refused to acknowledge a possible defect in manufacture and said to return item to AMAZON. Says a lot about their product. Too bad, as the LitterMaid automatic litterbox works very well."
1,Cheaply made - Frame breaks easily,"The first time I assembled this, my cat jumped on top of it and the whole thing collapsed. I took it apart and discovered that one of the CHEAP plastic corner connectors had snapped. It's now held together with duct tape. Does Littermaid expect that cat's won't jump up on something like this that's flat on top and begs to be explored? If they do, then why is the frame made out of such fragile and flimsy plastic?"
2,Forget about it,"the privacy tent is a very clever item.well made, out of good materials, but highly impractical.the privacy issue with your cat is much less an issue thanbeing able to keep the electronic cat box clean and workingproperly.this tent makes it virtually impossible to see what's happenedin the box, and to smooth the litter around now and then.this is something you'll need to be able to do.i bought it, but wound up lining the bottom with a blanket, and a few toys.my cats sleep and play in it."
1,Waste of money!!!,"Nice concept, poorly executed. The support structure to hold the tent in place is of the lowest quality plastic out there. The frame didn't last 2 months before it started cracking at places (and I have a little kitten weighing less than 9lbs). If I were you, I would save my money and look elsewhere."
1,Does not work well with Elite Mega,"This tent is a little small for the Elite Mega - and it's difficult to get it in the tent, and then removing it to clean, etc. is a pain."
3,Cat Privacy tent too big for regular litter boxes,This product was of great quality but not for regular size litter boxes.It was much too large and cumbersome to fit over the standard size litter box.It is really meant for the automatic cleaning litter box type and I'm sure it would be great for that.
3,"Does the job once assembled, but parts kept breaking during assembly","This tent was purchased to replace an existing tent that the cat had made a mess in. No problems at all with the first tent, but the plastic frame on this new one kept breaking when I tried to assemble it. After a couple pieces broke, I started to be extremely gentle and careful when putting the rest of the frame together, but they would still break. I'd assemble a tube on to an elbow, and it would seem to be fine, then the tube would just snap off of it seemingly without provocation. Obviously got a bad batch of plastic with this one.Was able to use parts of the plastic frame from the old tent in order to get this one put together. Which, by the way, I really had to wrestle with to disassemble, and despite that, nothing on the old frame broke. If not for that, I would have been calling Littermaid to get replacement parts."
3,Just OK,"This is the second time that I ordered this tent. My first one lasted for several year. I washed both parts in the washing machine multiple times and it was pretty durable. When I ordered this one, I had problems with the plastic connecter pieces braking, when I put them together. When I put the little connectors in the tubes, the connectors seemed to be to big and broke the tubes. The stitching is opening up and doesn't look very strong either.I like the tent, it keep the litter from making a mess, but the quality is not what I expected."
5,Perfect privacy!,"This privacy tent was exactly as described and pictured. Just please be careful on plastic tubes, they break easily when pushing into corners so don't use too much strength!"
1,"Poor Quality, Poor Sizing",This product is not made for the littermaid elite mega. It just doesn't fit. The rake is not able to go all of the way forward without hitting the sides of the tent and the containment part will not open because of the sides. Definitely would NOT recommend!
3,Not too bad,"I agree with some of the other reviews in that the tent is hard to zip up because it is a bit small for the frame. It isn't top notch quality, but it gets the job done. I have had to train the kitties not to jump on top because it would buckle under the pressure. All in all, it helps with the odor and makes the litter box look much, much better. I would reccomend."
2,Cheap,I broke this thing in two places while trying to put it together. And I'm not an impatient tough guy or anything. I'm just your average chick. With normal sized hands. I'm not the hulk. Really really lame. It would have been really cool if the connectors hadn't broken though.
2,Poor Quality,"I had one of these years ago and it was great! What they make now is unbelievably cheap. The frame broke just putting it together. We taped it for now. The cover is super cheap as well. It's doing the job, but is really fragile. It's too bad. This used to be a really good product."
2,Cumbersome & Almost Impossible to Install Without Tearing,"We finally (between my husband, my son and me) finally got this thing stretched over the plastic frame, but it tore on the seam at one of the corners. You have to lift up the heaving litterbox to put inside of it--it won't slide in or out over the connecting rods in the bottom. Soooooo, you can imagine how easy to clean it is--NOT! A two piece design with the top that would fit over the box with a bottom sheet that snapped onto the top piece would be a better design."
3,If you are looking for something cheap...,"The tent looks great in the photos, but when you try to assemble it, you will find out just how cheaply made it is. The fabric doesn't quite cover the frame. It will take some adjusting to get it to fit. And before I was finished assembling it, two seams began to unravel. If you are looking to save money, then go ahead and buy it. If you are looking for quality, look elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money,"One of my cats absolutely refused to enter it, and did his ""business"" next to the litterbox instead. The big guy flattened it, and a couple of others hated it so much they made a point of spraying it and trying to wipe their butts on it. Needless to say, it ended up in the garbage. It's not that these cats won't use a covered box -- they will and do -- they just really, really hated this tent."
4,Confines the Stink,"The tent really helps with the smell. The quality of the material needed to make the tent is not the best (one of the tubes snapped while putting it together), but it still does what it's suppose to do."
2,Litter Maid Catbox Tent Cover,"This is the third tent cover that I've had for my Litter Maid catbox. While the litter box is reliable, the tent covers have been less than satisfactory, but a necessity. My cat is very non-destructive, so the tent covers demise have nothing to do with my pet. The first tent cover tore as it was fit to the cat box. The second tent cover's frame cracked and then tore the tent cover. Because of the privacy the tent provides and the necessity to keep litter from going all over the place, this third tent cover was again necessary. But for the cost that Litter Maid charges for their products, I'd have thought their product to be more reliable overall. I do love my Litter Maid catbox, but again, the expense doesn't nec. match the quality of the accessories."
2,Princess SuLing's privacy,"The privacy tent does keep litter ""contained"", my siamese has a habit of ""slinging"" cat litter .The frame is plastic and one of the plastic 'tees' broke easily. had to return the first one due to zipper ""malfunction"". The zipper is difficult to zip, very tight. I had to reset the auto cat box and that entails unzipping .. after which I don't attempt to re-zip, the top just sits on top of frame."
4,A little modification...,"For those who do not like the less-than-adequate plastic tubing in the frame:One of the sections broke as i was assembling the unit. I decided to use the box the litter box came in and settled it over the frame; I then put the tent over the box. I now have a more solid structure, which withstands my two cats using it to jump up on to the dryer to get to their food bowls.This has worked great for me for over two years with two cats. Another section of the tubing has broken but the cardboard box over the unit has allowed the tent to maintain its shape and function. I do recommend this tent for all its stated reasons. It definitely could be better constructed, but with the box I have over it, I am quite satisfied."
1,Not really worth it,"I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand. The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo. Also, the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand. Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading, which this does not do. there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro, the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit. Don't waste your $$ on this accessory."
3,Poorly designed,"Pros:Keeps litter better contained. It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance, instead of all over the room.Gives the cats privacy.Keeps the smell down a bit.Cons:It's difficult to get the zipper closed.The litterbox doesn't fit out the entrance easily (and unzipping it is out of the question).It's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed (and it misses lots of clumps, so I have to deal with this problem 3-4 times a day)."
2,good idea but...,"Needs about 1/2 inch all the way around on the seams. Split the horizontal seams in two places trying to squeeze the tent over the frame. Very CHEAP vinyl material. Should have some stretch to it. Opening is too small to get the box out for cleaning unless you get right down in front of it. Again, a stretch in the material would help and a better opening design."
1,IT'S JUNK!,After less than 6 months multiple connectors have broken. Littermaid does not warranty 'accessories'. But they will sell me connectors for almost what I paid for the tent or sell me another one. No Thanks.Littermaid LMT100 LitterMaid Cat Privacy Tent
5,The best source for rare complete drawings,"This book is incredible. The only book I have found that has complete plans, sections, elevations and detailed drawings of furniture and paneling inside of the Petit Trianon. You almost could rebuild it based on this large book. Extremely hard to find but worth it! Great for scholars and those obsessed with Versailles."
5,Merry Christmas,"nice product, with great looking and nice price. it's hard for me find it at market, but easy at ebay.."
5,Steiner Peregrine - the best!,"These are wonderful binoculars!Bright, crystal clear images with exceptional color rendition. The colors have to be seen to be believed. The focus is a rapid close-focus system with left hand diopter adjustment. The precise central focus wheel will go from a close focus of less than 6 feet out to infinity in just one full turn.The steiner peregrine binoculars are lightweight too. A great purchase for anyone who appreciates excellent quality optics."
5,A good way to learn to English,"This software is great for learning how to pronounce English words. English is my second language. For 16 years, I have been searching for ""something"" that can explain to me how to speak better English. This software has improved my English pronunciation in just less than one month. People don't ask me to repeat myself as much. I am really grateful to find and learn it. It has unlocked the key for better English speaking. Thank you."
2,"looks good ,but didnt help","i bought this for my son's nanny.how can someone learn english when all the instuctions are in english?the dictionary is helpful,but this program is obviously for people with some knowledge of the english language.it does not make it clear that this is not for someone who knows no english."
2,Not That Great,"I am friends with the ""evil"" actress in this movie (Inger Wegge), although her name is mis-spelled in the movie credits as Inga Wege. It is interesting, but some of the nude scenes are so ridiculously drawn out, that they detract from the story. This was in the early 70s when gratuitous nudity was spattered all over the silver screen. Too bad. This actually would have been a decent movie if Hollywood knew when to say ""cut!"" on the nudy scenes.Update (10/30/2012): Unfortunately, Inger Wegge passed away on October 30, 2007 (five years ago today). I was staying with her once in her apartment in NYC, and we were discussing this movie. She told me she had not been happy with the inclusion of all the gratuitous sex scenes (which according to her, she hadn't even been aware of...and did not see it until she saw the movie for herself). She was not present during the filming of those scenes, although the editing makes it look like she was."
4,Terrific standard fisheye lens,"This is a terrific standard fisheye lens. Unlike many fisheyes, it creates a full-screen rectangular image. The filters that come with the lens are an added bonus. Wonderful and fun images can be created. Don't waste your money on the filter-type screw-on fisheye lenses that distort your image beyond all recognition and don't allow for correct metering or focusing. This has been a wonderful addition to my lens collection, and one that I frequently find myself pulling out of the bag for a special effect here and there - from a lying-on-the-ground in the forest photo, to a wrap-around view of the WDW castle...I mark it down one star only because of the price -- Nikon has several fisheye lenses, and all of them are overpriced for the limited use these lenses receive. Still, it is comperable in price to the 15/2.8 sigma fisheye with much better glass quality."
5,Amazing lens,With this lens you will have a lot of fun: fantastic distortion(like a special effect) with the super wide view plus good sharpness without any flare even against the sun light. For most effective using this lens you have to have some experience.
4,Great recipes,"I've been cooking dairy-free more lately and this book has very good recipes, very tasty with good ingredients. Not low-fat or low-calorie, for that I use the Happy Herbivore. But these desserts turn out great. Borrowed a copy from a friend and was very happy to find a used copy in good shape for a good price."
4,good quality cookbook,There are plenty of receipes that are very good. I didnt give it five stars cause I dont like agar flakes.
1,Garbage,Gone through 2 of these in 7 months. first one had the hot plate quit after 4 months. Called B&D and they said to take it to the nearest repair center (160 miles away). So I bought another one (only $15 on sale - less than gas to go to repair center)This one quit working altogether after 3 months. Wouldn't take another one if they gave it to me
3,This is a so-so machine,"This is my second one within a year. The first one started to make noises that I actually thought it was going to explode. I called B&D; and said they to cut the cord off leaving the plug.Within a few weeks, I had a brand new one.The plate leaves burn spots that cannot be removed and it's kind of hard to clean entirely. Even the pot.It's a good starter coffee machine until one can save enough $$$ for a Braun.The machine has been discontinued so that should say a lot."
5,Renewed Faith!,"The Yada Yada Prayer Group series may be fiction but it holds a lot of truth!I found it to be challenging and inspiring, with a story about a family and their friends all of us can relate to. I highly recommend reading the series. In fact, they're worth passing on."
5,Yada Yada,"I can't rate any particular book of the Yada Yada Prayer Group book series any higher than the others. I love the entire series. I think the story consistantly gets better as it goes along. This is definitely something I highly recommend to any woman out there who wants to read something fun, dramatic and meaningful."
4,As always a favorite,"This one didn't have as many surprises as some of the past ones, but it was still a good read."
1,Poor service,"I am very disappointed with the service I received from bordeebook. After requesting to know where my stuff was, after several weeks of not receiving it, I was told to ""wait 30 days"". After 30 days I again inquired where my stuff was and was told it must be lost and they would issue a full refund. In order to get a refund I must wait until they send me (via snail mail) a confirmation code which I will email back to them and then they will send me a refund. It is now one week since I received that direction and I still have not received the confirmation code. I have never dealt with a company with such poor service and will not order from them again. Obviously, I still do not have the book I ordered."
2,The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Tough,"The book arrived on time and looked to be in new or near new condition. However, when I got to page 148 the next page number was 21. And went through page 52 (again). After second page 52, it went to page 181. I missed an important portion of the story. I am hoping that the seller was unaware of this error in the book.Otherwise, these Yada Yada Prayer Group books are great!"
5,Safe for newborns!,"Great neck support for the newborn provided by the blue cushion shown in picture. The newborn will feel very comfy in this. There are two open spaces to put soap or anything you want in them. Comes with a container to put water or soap water, anything you would like to use for the baby. Stable and won't tilt over."
5,Great Tub,This tub is great! My twins don't slide down and the dishes on the sides are pretty cool. The pad on the botten is soft. This makes bathtime fun!
2,Great for about a week and a half...,"This bathtub sounded like a great idea, and when we brought her home for the first time and gave her her first bath it *was* great. The second time, she had enough muscular control to arch her back out of the water - She absolutely HATED being on the pad in this tub! We used it very sparingly for about 4 months, being too broke to buy another one until she could sit up on her own reliably. Now she takes a bath in the kitchen sink or a big plastic tub. I'm sure other babies would like it, but ours didn't... Anyone want to buy a barely-used ergonomic baby bath?"
3,"You get what you pay for, folks!","I purchased this machine with trepidation at cost vs. quality. I have been using it for over a year. It is noisy. The last 1/2 inch of whatever your chopping will likely get stuck spinning between the lid and the cutter blade. Other than that...it does the job pretty darn well and saved me hundreds of dollars over Cuisinart. If you rinse immediatly after use -- no staining. As far as complaints of locking mechanisms snapping off -- I believe that to be user error. If the lid is not PROPERLY AFFIXED, you WILL snap off locking mechanisms. If used properly, you will have no problems with it. You get what you pay for. We all know if we spend 10x less on a product, it's going to be slightly more difficult to use and of lower quality. For me, it does the job and saved me big bucks. I am satisfied with it."
1,"Don't get it, spend more for a better processor!",I wanted an inexpensive food processor that I could use occasionally for preparing fruits and other foods for storage. So I got this one. I liked the thought of having the food dispense into a separet bowl. That is acutally my biggest problem with this things. If you don't want the food to come out the chut well TO BAD because it does anyway! Its very frustrating! Also it does smell like something burning when you turn it one. This was a huge waste of money even though it didn't cost much.... I guess the saying holds true with this food processor... you get what you pay for!
1,Cheap quality inside,"The Black & Decker FP1400 has a very sturdy bowl and a very good chopping blade and a fairly good shredding/slicing disk. The unit styling looks very nice, but beauty is only skin deep with this one as the sound that it makes is one of the loudest food processors I have tried out. The sound is no way near as nice as a Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid. It is so noisy that it has a high pitch squeel that resembles a noisy hand drill. The moving parts inside the unit sounds like cheap plasticy grinding gears. Don't buy this."
1,No more cheap appliances for me!,"I would have given negative stars, but there isn't an option for that. I was looking for an inexpensive food processor for the occasional job that requires a food processor. Black & Decker usually makes very good appliances, and for the price I paid, I said what the heck. What a mistake! This processor sounds like it's heralding the apocalypse and after 3 uses, one of the bowl clips snapped right off. I also tried to use the continuous flow chute. About 1/4 of my chopping ended up in the processor bowl. Thankfully, it didn't explode like the other reviewers! I guess I'll have to wait for a Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid to go on sale..."
2,Culinary Crap,"Leaks, even with leak guard on. Grates well if you use a small amount of food at once, but forget it if you want to try to hash a couple of potatoes at once. You'll wind up with some potato mush and some potato chunks. And speaking of CHUNKS....the reason I really don't like this thing is because the slicer/shredder disk doesn't just shred, it slices all at the same time! If you want cheese shreds, be prepared for shred/chunks. The problem is that as the food passes between the shred holes on the disk, it slips down into the dull side of the slicer hole and slices at the same time! This is my first processor; maybe all of them with the reversible disk work this way. I know processors are supposed to be multi-taskes, but only when you want them to be. Geesh! This one's going back to the store."
1,You get what you pay for.....,"I have only used this machine a handful of times and each time it scares me! It shakes and is dreadfully loud! The first time I shredded cheese it did fine, but each time after it got worse and worse. I could smell burning, the cheese wasn't shredded it was a paste and the plastic on the blades ended up shredded more then the cheese. It makes me wonder if I am not supposed to shred cheese in a food processor!!!!"
2,"Works Well, but.....","The processor works great. It easily chops, shreds and mixes dough without trouble. But, I still wouldn't recommend it even for a novice cook who won't use it a lot. The plastic that the bowl is made of is just too thin and weak. I'm not a professional chef, I don't even use this product every week but still the bowl has completely broken apart after what I would guess was only a dozen uses. I'm also disappointed that i'm not able to buy a replacement. So even though the motor and blades are still working perfectly, i'm going to have to toss it and get a new one. I realise that this is a low end machine, so i wasn't expecting it to last forever, but really.......a dozen uses? Sorry, spend a little more money and get something more durable."
2,Eh.,"Amazingly loud. And the cup thing is a pain in the... to get on and off. It takes me several minutes to get it locked, and i've had it for 6 months. I'd get a different one next time."
2,Quick n Easy Food Processor,"I purchased this item in September and already the plastic part that goes on the slicing blade, the hole is warped out. Now I must order another part or even the whole blade again. I have never had any success with plastic parts."
3,"ok, if you're not needing it on a daily (or even weekly) basis","I've had this processor for nearly 3 years and was generally happy with it, but I only used it ocassionally. However, now that I have a baby, I'm making all her food and using the processor quite frequently. I have poor results when I try to grind uncooked grains, and yesterday, as I was setting the bowl on the counter the plastic rim cracked and broke off the bottom. It is now useless. I think I will replace it with a different brand. For a frequent user, it's not great. Also, I must mention that on several ocassions it was hard to unlock the bowl from the base and also remove the plastic top that locks in."
2,plastic is cheap,"I received this as a gift three years ago, and immediately the plastic bowl cracked on the bottom. Then progressively, the whole bottom lip part on one side of the bowl completely cracked off. then the latches on the lid also broke, so I have to guess now when my top is latched. All of this happened within the first month of me having the food processor. I am an avid maker of hummus, and I have noticed that the motor is extremely loud(you'll want to wear ear plugs) and the hummus I made isn't even close to being smooth. It is ok at first, but the blades dull and it smells as if the engine is going to blow up. If you are only processing in pulses this machine works better."
2,Not worth the hassle,"I received this food processor as a Christmas gift. After the first use, I notice a crack in the handle of the bowel. If you shred anything it clogs up the chute. Carrots turned the plastic orange;I had to use bleach to remove the stain. When I tried slicing green peppers for salads, they turned out like mush. The cucumbers we fine.Over all, you get what you pay for. I like to cook, so this product is not for me. If you seldom cook and are not picky about the cut of your food, buy this. I, however, returned the processor to the store for a full refund. I am saving for a Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid, which are much more sturdier than the Black and Decker. Good Luck."
1,Quick n' easy it ain't,"Food processors are not exactly known for ease of use, but this has got to be one of the worst. It is awkward and unwieldy, leaks at every seam, and fails in what I assume to be its primary task: to chop and blend with some measure of consistency. Pay the money for a decent machine, or you're better off with mortar and pestle."
2,Not what I hoped for...,"It does have just one rotatory blade for slice/shred. However, if you try the shred mode, most food will inevitably go into the slide opening. The result is a mixture of shredded and sliced stuff (I tried root vegetables)."
3,Nice and squishy but no react well to squeezing or tearing like other stress items,Nice and squishy but no react well to squeezing or tearing like other stress items like thera putty. For children this is probably very nice though. It is quite colorful and feels nice in hand
1,Brew stopper doesn't work well,"This pot has overflowed for me 3 times, and I've had it for just 2 months. The brew stopper mechanism leaves much to be desired. I'm going to get a new coffee maker today, so I don't have to deal with the mess again."
5,Easy to Use with No Mess and Good Coffee and Cheap,"This is one of the recommended models in Consumer Reports last coffee review. I agree. It's the cleanest, easiest, and fastest design I've seen in a long time. Carafe is drip free and the filter basket is a simple easy to use/clean design. My only quibble is that the brewing process is just a notch below the best coffeemaker (Braun KF400). I had the Braun but got fed up with it's drippy carafe and quirky filter basket.If you have little time in the morning to fight with your coffeemaker and don't want to waste a lot of time wiping up spilled coffee, this is the coffeemaker for you. I'm a cream and sugar type so the brew quality is good enough for me."
1,Poor Quality,"We have gone through three of these Black and Decker coffeemakers in the past three months. Each one has failed because of flimsy components and poor design. Unless you are willing to get to know the B&D customer service staff on a first-name basis, I'd recommend that you steer clear of the low-end coffee brewing products from this manuufacturer."
1,Horrid!,Loved the design...Tried four 4 Different makers and all four the clock didnt work!! Black and Decker has horrible service when I called.
2,"Looks nice, Tastes Bland",I bought this coffee maker based on its smart looks and reasonable price. Unfortunately the coffee it makes is quite bland even after upping the amount of grounds used. This is especially obvious when brewing less than 10 cups. I'm now looking for a maker with a cone style filter and a flavor selector or setting for brwing less than a full pot.
5,great coffeemaker,"I recently bought this from Amazon. It was shipped promptly and I received it in excellent condition, much sooner than I expected. It is so easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee. There is no way it would leak on the counter if you put the pot back on the warmer correctly. It only fits in a certain way. My advice is go ahead and buy it, for the price, you won't find anything better."
1,"Carafe leaked on day one, unit failed at 11 months","Seal between the carafe and plastic spout were not adequately glued together. Disappointing and now have to deal with getting a replacement after 1 week of use. Coffee brewed fine but overall the unit is somewhat flimsy.I'd expect 1-2 years max before one of the plastic hinges would fail.UPDATE:Unit is 11 months old and the reservoir failed, leaks all over the counter when filled. Sent back for warranty replacement again, cost $8.55 for Shipping and postage."
4,"easy, good coffee",I'm happy to have purchased this coffeemaker. I read others' reviews and decided this was the one to buy. The only negative I have is that it ticks or snaps while it's on. Makes me wonder if there's an electrical malfunction. I've had this for 1 month.
5,I agree with Consumer Reports...it's great!,"Easy to use and easy to clean. We grind our fresh beans and pour the ground coffee in the filter, press start and next thing you know, you have great coffee. We highly recommend this coffee maker."
1,Do not buy,While the carafe is of excellent design and does not leak when coffee is poured the clock on the programmable maker does not work. I have bought 3 coffee makers in the last month and ALL three had/have defective clocks. All three have different manufactures date codes. By the time you pay for shipping going and coming under the warranty it becomes a very expensive coffee maker--and the clock still does not work!!
2,"Leaky, Noisy - not worth it","I've had this coffemaker for only a year - it is the noisiest thing ever and has now begun to leak. I had my last coffemaker for 13 years (Mr. Coffee). Another reviewer here says she had 4 good years with this one. 4 years is not a lot...you shouldn't have to replace your coffeemaker every 4 years...yes, this was reasonably priced and it's nice to see the water level, but other than that, I haven't been happy with this product."
2,Fantastic Idea with a Bad Design,"I bought my Smart Brew Plus at Target about a year ago and loved the idea I could snatch a cup of coffe while the pot was brewing. I think this is a wonderful concept that has great merit. Sadly, the carafe that comes with the system doesn't hold up to even my light daily use. The flimsy clips that hold the carafe on, broke off during the first month. I limped along for quite a while with this problem. Now, the plastic ring around the top has separated from the glass part of the carafe. As it brews, coffee gets trapped in here and is impossible to get out. A replacement carafe costs almost as much as a new pot! Additionally, the burner ring became warn after about 4 months of washing with only a damp cloth."
3,two big challenges,I have experienced two problems with this coffee maker. First is the warmer surface. The coating wore off very quickly. The second is the coffee pot / carafe. The handle and the spout are great. The glass is very thin and not Corning Ware glass. I broke my glass carafe just after a little tap to the inside of my sink. Try getting a replacement!
2,I'd Look Elsewhere,"We too have had awful leaks with this machine - the clock stopped working after the first leak - just a couple of months after I purchased it. Now it's leaking so badly that I have to replace it, a little over a year after I bought it. I would stay away from this model."
1,dripping mess,"Coffee maker does well except for one major item! When pouring into cup, the pot seems to leak onto counter almost as much as what goes in the cup! Unless you pour it at the rate of taking about 15 seconds per cup."
2,Mine just broke.,"After about a year and a half of very light use (I usually make coffee at home only for guests, at work I buy from a coffee shop), mine just broke. Water just stopped flowing from the reservoir into the basket all of a sudden. It worked fine yesterday.It's OK for the price, but if I had been using this thing regularly it would probably have broken after three months. Also, the carafe is cheaply made; the handle is wobbly and the lid doesn't sit on it correctly, so sometimes there's some spillage. It's also very hard to clean.If I can't fix the one I have, I might buy another one of these, but chances are I'll spring for a more reliable model, especially since I'm going to start making coffee at home a lot more often."
1,Worthless,"This was given to us as a christmas gift(Dec 25,03), and as of this morning(march 12,04) it 'WENT HAYWIRE'! For sometime now, it seems to get louder while working, but this morning it just poured coffee & grounds everywhere. The on/off button wouldn't stop it, so I finally had to unplug it. After cleaning everything, I decided to do a test pot with only 4 cups of water. That's when it really started to 'pop' and water went everywhere!JUNK!"
1,You get what you pay for!!,"Coffee maker worked fine for about two months. It gradually became more and more noisy. Now it takes about 25 minutes to brew 8 cups and is louder than my dishwasher! I have cleaned it several times to no avail. Also, when the lid is lifted to add water or remove used coffee and filter, water that has collected on the lid spills behind the coffee maker, making a mess. I no longer use this piece of junk!"
3,Not bad...,Love that you can set to brew ahead of time! As for the spill-proof - ours spills with every single use. Doesn't matter if you pour slow or fast....it spills.Still not a bad deal for the $.
4,Wonderful coffeemaker!,"I was somewhat skeptical about purchasing the SmartBrew Plus because of the reasonable price . . . but I soon discovered that I couldn't have selected a better coffeemaker. It is easy to set up, simple to use - the timer is great. I really like the way they designed it, so that you just lift the top to put in the coffee and water. You don't have to worry about getting the filter basket back in place properly. The unit does not leak water, as some coffeemakers do; neither does the carafe. The wide pour spout on the carafe is definitely a plus. The unit is attractive, and does not take up very much counter space. Use good-quality, fresh coffee, and it will make a great cup. I have now had the SmartBrew Plus for a little over two years, and I have no complaints. Can't beat it for the price!"
3,Great concept. needs a little work,"I loved this coffee pot. my biggest complaint of coffee pots in general is the carafe. no matter how slow I try to pour it gets everywhere and drives me crazy. The carafe on this model is perfect. I don't know why no one else has the wide pour spout, but I can't find it on any other model. There are some problems with it though. my first one had a small leak at the back on the bottom of the brewer which I didn't discover until it shorted out after about 6 months. The second one just kind of exploded one day. We have high alkali in the water where I live and the build-up is pretty bad so it could have been because of that. I had that one for about a year."
1,Over flows!!,"My mother and I bought this coffee maker the same day and we both have the same problem... The filter basked over flows!!! The ""sneak a cup"" no-drip filter basket works TOO WELL! In fact, it doesn't allow the coffee to flow into the pot and therefore overflows all over the counter! If you like coffee and grounds all over your counter and in your coffee this is the one for you! If you fiddle with the drip baskets & coffee pot for an hour or so and make sure it doesn't get bumped AT ALL, you might save yourself a mess (or you might not). With my mother's machine it happened 100% of the time. With mine, I fiddled with it long enough and babysat it while it brewed, so it only happened 90% of the time... But, in the end, I'd recommend STAY AWAY from this coffee maker!!! Unless you like spending your morning mopping up coffee and grounds before you've had your first cup of coffee."
4,SmartBrew Coffeemaker,"Produces very hot coffee, just like we want. Is easier to clean than my old Mr. Coffee"
3,DCM-2500 Coffee Maker,"This product does a good job of brewing coffee. The Carafe is well designed so it does not drip when you pour.I don't like the 2 hour shut off time- would rather have an option to extend it.We find water on the counter behind the coffee maker. This is due to the design of the lid on the water storage tank. When you raise the lid after coffee has been brewed, condensation inside the lid runs down past the hinge and down the back of the coffee maker. Seems like a little redesign of the lid could prevent this."
3,CLOCK DOESN'T KEEP TIME,THE CLOCK NEVER HAS KEPT TIME. IT WILL BE OFF BY HOURS IN ONE DAY! BUT WE DON'T USE THE TIMER SO IT'S OK. OTHERWISE IT IS LOW COST AND WORKS GREAT.
2,not happy!,"If the pot isn't put EXACTLY into the center of the place, ther is coffee everywhere. The plate actually has a thin rim that the carafe sit into. Forget about it if you are in a hurryQ"
3,B&D DCM2500 Meets My Criteria,"I reviewed many coffee makers on Amazon.com. Very few met the following criteria: Less than 14 inches tall, programmable, and disposable filter.I would have preferred one with two optimized brew settings: 2 cup and 12 cup cup. I didn't find any. We have been using the B&D; for about three weeks now. It works, but the plastic is thin and cheap in appearance compared to what we are used to. I may look again at what is available, and find a place where a taller coffeemaker could sit."
1,worst coffee pot i ever bought,"although i do not like having to write a bad reveiw,i must let others know my experience.we bought this product within the last year.it worked fine until one day it turned on by itself burning the bottom of the pot,and began smoking.my husband pulled the plug and called the company.we were asured this product was the best one yet and they sent us a new one(same model)reluctant to use it a few months past and this one is now turning itself on.i no longer leave it plugged in especially when leaving the house.PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE THIS PLUGGED IN i believe this to be a fire hazard.i have bought many products from black and decker and have had no other problems with there products just this one.hope this helps"
1,Lacks quality,"This is one lousy coffee maker. Don't waste your money on it. You cannot make a full pot of coffee because the basket doesn't brew fast enough and runs over. If you're in a hurry, forget it. It takes forever(at least 10 minutes) to brew even the smallest pot. The quality of the brewed coffee(regardless of brand name) is bad. The instructions are confusing and insufficient. Pick another coffee maker. You couldn't get any worse than this one."
2,Big Mistake,I made a big mistake when I bought this coffee maker. I just returned it today after having it only 6 weeks. The carafe leaks around the plastic rim and gets all over the counter and then when you place it back on the burner it leaks on it and the burner had started to rust after only 6 weeks of use. I don't suggest this coffee maker to anyone. I bought a Melitta this time and love it.
1,Shame on you Black & Decker!!!!,Have bought several Black & Decker coffee makers over the years...this is the last one for me...used it ONE time and it's going back for a refund...can't even set the time/and or program the timer...the digital clock just goes haywire and won't stop.Had to unplug it..what a nuisence..last time I buy anything from Black & Decker..SAVE YOUR MONEY..TRY ANOTHER BRAND.
1,just bad,I've incountered 3 different pots of this model that just plain overflow! What a mess! Time to try a new brand.
2,"Two tries, two problems","I bought this machine because of its Best Buy rating in Consumer Reports. All I can figure is that CR got some sort of perfect specimen. The first machine I received had a problem with the clock -- it would keep minutes fine, but the hours went all over the place. I set it up in the evening, reset it in the morning (after it didn't start brewing at the time I had programmed), and it was off again by the time I got home.Since I drink coffee every day, I figured I'd use the coffeemaker until the replacement arrived. That came a couple days later...and the lid was broken. Needless to say, I'm not asking for another replacement.I'm pretty disappointed in this machine because the coffee brewing aspects seem to work well. The carafe is well-designed and hasn't dripped, and the machine is easy to set up, use, and clean. Hopefully B&D; will fix the electronics and plastics problems someday."
4,Tricky,"The coffee itself is good, but the mechanics of loading and preparing can be a challenge. The carafe must be carefully placed so that the coffee flows directly through its lid. The tight fit between the basket and the heating pad can cause inattentive brewers to allow the coffee to flow off the lid instead of into the carafe. This happened on our second pot and caused the clock to malfunction and spurred an exchange. Also, the reservoir lid cannot be completely opened without moving it from under the cupboard when filling it with water. A minor inconvenience, but an awkward, extra motion that further complicates what should be an easy process. If the machine will be placed under a cupboard, check the height of the 10-cup model, which might make for a better fit."
4,Great for the price,"I've had the Black & Decker coffee pot for about a month now. I was hesitant to purchase after reading reviews, however I've had absolutely no problems with it. It is a flimsy product, but considering the price it's well worth it. It's fast, the coffe stays hot and tastes great. I found out the pot lid is removeable after weeks of trying to clean it while it's attached. Now that I take it off to clean, I'm wondering how long it will be until it breaks and can no longer be attached to the pot. I like the water marks on the side. Easy to read.All in all, I'm very pleased with the purchase. Let's just see how long it lasts."
3,Makes Coffee But Can't Keep Time,"Nice, straightforward coffeemaker, which got the top Consumer Reports rating, so I bought one. It has a clock so it can be set to make coffee at a specified time. The clock didn't work (the time display showed the wrong time when checked some hours after being set; this kept happening). So, I called the Customer Service number and was told I had to send them a part of the cord and a check for $7.50 in order to get a replacement product. When a product doesn't work right out of the box, it should be replaced at the maker's expense, it seems to me."
4,Coffee maker,"We are quite happy with this product. It makes good coffee with a minimum of effort, and that is just fine with us!"
3,"Love it, but needs frequent replacing; use hard water w/ decaf","Quite a few years ago we tried several coffee makers before finding this model. We like the no-drip carafe, the see-through water reservoir, the wide opening for water. We love it, but unfortunately, this model only lasts about 2 years then the heating element fails. However, all of them have made very hot coffee until then! I think we are on our 3rd one. It isn't too expensive to replace and often goes on sale or has great promotions after Christmas. One thing we learned when we were looking at coffee makers: softened water and decaf coffee do not work together. After overflowing many coffee makers, we found it stated on one website that the sodium ions in softened water form a gelatinous mass around the coffee grounds, slowing down the extraction process and thus overflowing the basket if you're trying to make a full pot!"
4,Consumer Reports Rated this a Best Buy,"and for the money, it isn't bad. If our water wasn't so hard, we would probably have better luck with a coofee pot, even though we clean it frequently. Still, we get a little over a year, and for this price range, its not so painful to replace."
1,Buttons are very vunerable to moisture,"The bubble type buttons on this unit are very vunerable to moisture. If you spill coffee or water on them they will soon stop working. They are not as waterproof as they look, and even cleaning the area around them with a damp cloth can ruin them. If you want a more reliable coffeemaker, buy one with different style buttons, or better yet, one with the buttons on the top, not at the base. My Smartbrew stopped working after one year."
2,Strange Coffee Maker,"This machine requires so much coffee to get a proper cup with body and flavor. It's really annoying! We have tried experimenting with different grinds of coffee, from fine espresso to regular auto-drip, and it doesn't matter: we still have to scoop in more and more and MORE coffee to get anything beyond a wan, watery cup. We are biding our time until we can get a good reliable Mr. Coffee, and get rid of this coffee-hogging ""Smart Brew."""
1,Control panel not water resistant,"This product only lasted a few weeks before some spilled water got into the control panel at the base of the unit, rendering it useless. It only took one small drip to completely short out the control panel. It doesnt matter how many great features if the product doesnt work."
2,"Tasty coffee, but cheap and faulty construction","I was impressed with this coffee maker's smooth lines and clean look, and trusted B&D brand. Though the coffee came out ok, very quickly the top of the coffee maker (where you pour in water as well as put the filter and coffee) detached and never stays fully in place. There are two cheap plastic catchers that are supposed to keep the top on but broke very quickly."
2,Spout on carafe is off center,"The glass carafe is poorly designed because discharge point is left of center and encourages spills. Previous models of Black & Decker coffeemakers featured a very stout and more elegant looking carafe. A carafe from an older B&W models will not fit into this coffeemaker. I'm very frustrated with this design change. I enjoyed being able make and serve multiple pots of coffee with interchangeable older B&D carafes over the years, so I am doubly disappointed with the design features in this model."
2,Hate this coffee pot,"Have been using this coffee pot for 2 months at work. Coffee isn't hot enough and absolutely hate the automatic shut off after 2 hours. I am always pouring a cup of luke warm coffee. In addition, when the top is opened after brewing, water from condensation runs down the back of the pot onto the counter. Would not buy again."
2,Dificult to Fit Under Cuboards,"This coffee maker's top flips open to add water and coffee grounds. The result is an added 8 inches to its height, which makes it awkward to use the unit on a couter top under a cabinet. It makes coffee fine."
1,Worst Coffeemaker ever!,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!! I have never written a review on any product... but I feel so strongly about this that I felt the need to warn others. This is the worst coffeemaker I have ever owned. I have gone through two of these machines in the past year. The first one I owned simply stopped working after about 3 months. I called Black and Decker and they agreed to replace it... if I paid for shipping and handling. They assured me this was not typical. However, now on coffeemaker number two, I came downstairs to grab coffee before leaving for work and this one has simply stopped working as well. Will not brew coffee by turning it on manually or setting the timer. Save yourself the headaches and do not buy this machine!"
2,water waster,"We purchased 1 of these and it broke in the first week, so we got another one. One year later, it is ready for the trash for 3 reasons: 1.It leaks about 2 cups of water onto the counter. Put in 12 cups of water and get 10 cups of coffee. The rest is leaked out from the top. 2.The beep to signal it's done brewing goes off whenever it wants, no longer signaling end of the brew time. 3.The warming plate is not hot, coffee needs to be reheated in microwave."
2,"Good design, but hot pad rusted through!","I got my Smart Brew Plus 2 years ago. It makes a good cup of coffee, and I like the design and ease of use of the unit. However, now my hotpad is almost completely rusted through. The rusting started about a year ago. I thought it was coffee on the hotpad and tried to clean it. I previously owned a Mr Coffee for 10 years with no problems, and decided to upgrade to a machine with a timer. I am disappointed to have to replace this unit so soon. Consumer Reports gave it a great rating, but I will be buying another brand."
1,you can not get charcoal filters,"The machine works great. But when you need to replace the charcoal filter in the water resevoir. you will not find them in stores, You will spend the price of the coffee pot to order the filters online,when you include shipping."
1,Cheap for a reason,"As I type this, I'm drinking a cup of instant coffee that I had bought for just such an emergency: Our B&D; Smartbrew gave out after 4 months of use.The best thing about it is the pouring spout, the look, and the programmable start/stop time. After that, it's all downhill.It's very easy to put too much coffee in and get grounds overflowing and sticking to the lid. Trying to use the full 12-cup capacity with this limit on grounds makes for very weak coffee.To refill it, you have to open the lid and watch stale condensation from the previous brew spill back into the reservoir. Before long, you'll find old grounds floating in the reservoir and sticking into uncleanable crannies.The final straw came this morning when I filled the reservoir and it drained immediately onto the countertop. Can't explain it..."
2,I've had it,"My number one pet peeve with coffee makers is overflow from malfunctioning drip baskets when the coffee pot does not get seated well into the burner area. I was ready for this when I purchased this moderately priced coffee maker and was pleasantly surprised when this didn't seem to be a problem after several days. Then it happened...and it turned out not to be the coffee pot problem at all...it is the filter basket on this little gem that gets out of whack. If it gets bumped *just a smidge* it will fail to seat itself down into the well and release the drip valve and the next thing you know you have coffee all over your counter. First time it happened I thought it must have been a fluke, but no...it's happened three times now and this pot is going into the trash. The last thing I need to be doing is spending my morning mopping up coffee and grounds ""before"" I've had that first dose of caffiene."
5,An excellent coffee maker,"Bought it over a year ago. Use it daily. It works great with ordinary tap water. It is simply a basic coffee maker. Not beautiful, not loaded with useless features, just an excellent basic coffee maker. Broke the pot this morning, however, and that means I will need to buy another one. At $21, even that is painless."
2,Disappointed,"Black& Decker DCM2500 SmartBrew 12-Cup CoffeemakerAfter much research, I purchased this Consumer Reports highly rated Best Buy 6 weeks ago. While it makes a great cup of coffee, the carafe leaks. It seems to be coming from the area where the plastic handle/spout component joins the glass. I have attempted to resolve this with Black and Decker, only to find out that they have sold this product line to Applica. Attempts to contact Applica reroute me back to the Black and Decker web page where I started. I give up."
2,Clock is Cuckoo - Coffee ok,The clock on this coffee maker is for the birds. Ability to keep time is random. Easy to set but it doesn't work. It brews coffee but good luck on having that done automatically. I purchased on recommendation of Consumer Reprorts and I am very disappointed.
3,Clock impossible to program.,"The machine looks and works fine. But it's annoying that the clock is impossible to program. I thought it was on a 24-hour basis, but it switches back to 12:00 after 14:00. Unless you are using the timer for morning coffee, etc., I would buy the similar model which is a few dollars cheaper and doesn't feature a timer."
3,"Good coffee, short life","I have always had an economical coffee maker like the Black and Decker DCM2500 but lately I have had to buy one after another, trying different brands each time. This one makes good coffee, just right temp, love the auto shut-off feature and is easy to fill. My problem is with the burner plate. It has been burning through and now rusting since we got it. The carafe has rust spots (I have a hard time removing)in the 2 places it sits over. The maker still works but I am worried it will catch fire or bust the glass carafe if not replaced. So I give it a 3 star rating. Not the worst I have ever had but not worth the money if I have to continually replace them. I am going with a new coffee maker that costs 3 times as much but maybe it will last at least 3 times longer."
5,Coffeemaker,"A person can buy a coffeemaker at a discount store for probably half the price of this one, but the cheap machines have a carafe that pours terribly. The cheap carafes have a narrow pouring spout that drips coffee everytime you pour a cup. The carafe for DCM2500W has a wide mouth spout and pours very well."
3,carafe doesn't drip,"I like my new Black & Decker 12 cup drip pot because it has a carafe that does not drip. I am disappointed that it does not beep to let you know when coffee is ready, and it doesn't have options for also making a stronger. It also has the inherent feature of these drip makers that the coffee does not come out hot."
4,Good Coffee Maker,"This is my second coffee maker of this model. I find it makes a good cup of coffee when you get the water/coffee proportions correct. I brew a couple of pots a day and the water gauge on the side of the brewer is easy to use. The Machine breaks down well for cleaning, and is easy to reassemble.The only issue is when you don't properly put the carafe on the hot plate, or take the pot out before the brew cycle is complete. You will have a spill as the brewer is fast.Ove the years I've had brewers that have cost a lot more and made an inferior cup coffee to this one good cheap machine. I would buy the DCM2500 again if this one dies.(my first one replaced another brand I had at my office."
1,JUNK - Not your Dad's Black and Decker Anymore,"Bought the Smartbrew after our Krupps finally kicked it after 6 years. Although this machine looks great and made a decent cup, liked the design of the spread out drip system, THE ELECTRONICS DIED after two months. The digital display flickered one day and the machine stopped working completely the next! By the way it was VERY noisy while brewing. Sadly it's not our dad's Black and Decker's anymore."
1,Arrived Dead-on-arrival,"Arrived dead-on-arrival so I really have no idea as to how it operates. It looked good. I had no problem returning it to Amazon for a credit(postage was even pre-paid). One star for the item, FIVE STARS for Amazon service!"
1,Dumb piece of garbage,"This is the worst coffeemaker I've ever owned. It lasted less than 3 months. First, if the pot is not placed in perfectly then the basket overflows all over. Second, if the basket overflows, then it shorts out the controls which are on the bottom under the carafe. It is dangerous, today it began to buzz. When I went to turn it off I couldn't. I had to unplug it to get it to shut off. Then I smelt a horrible burning from it overheating."
2,Satisfied with Refund,"While the product was not what I expected in a thermal top, the seller provided me with a prepaid return label and credited my account with thefull purchase price. Can't ask for more."
1,Did not receive product on time,"I was disappointed with the whole process of ordering. Amazon said my product would come within 7 days, which would have worked out perfectly as I needed the Cuddl Duds for my trip. The day before I left for my trip I received a shipment notification/receipt that I would receive my item in 7-10 days. So I had to go out and find some Cuddl Duds (not a big deal but when I had limited time to begin with, it was again irritating) which ended up being MUCH cheaper. It ended up being a 'win' situation for me, but I did lose some time. I will think twice before ordering from Amazon in a time-crunch."
5,nice flag,"Shockingly, I was unable to find a mini-flag of the U.S. flag anywhere locally. This is a great flag for my front yard."
3,"Rasta, Barrington","Must respect to you, Rasta lover! If you are true lover of Rasta and the love of Jah, this DVD is for you. You may be a bit disappointed in the quality of the video ""graininess"", but the sound is satisfying. One Love, Nigel Montego."
1,Extremely disappointing quality from the Jamaican Canary,"I wanted this dvd to be good, but try as I might....I just couldn't get into it. I've seen Barrington perform live several times (including during an amazing set at Reggae on the River 06 in NorCal - go to YouTube and you'll see exactly what I mean), but this dvd is truly a disappointment. The sound quality is horrible, and the fans seem pretty clueless to me (sorry San Francisco); when B Levy tries to break it down with his soulfull ""Vice Versa Love"" (one of my alltime favorite reggae songs), you can sense his frustration with the lack of attention and respect from the fans. I'm truly surprised that this dvd was even released, and I'm stunned that someone hasn't come along who can capture this man's genius on film. Save your money; I ended up giving this one away. The production is truly horrible."
1,Don't buy this one! Trust me.....,"I've seen Barrington Levy perform live 4 times; the most recent time was at Reggae on the River last summer (07) - you can watch an amazing clip of his set on YouTube. This dvd is HORRIBLE....the production value is the worst I have ever seen in a dvd, period. The crowd seems absolutely clueless, especially when Barrington tries to take it down a notch with his melodious ""Vice Versa Love"", and you can literally hear people yelling at waitresses for more drinks. I ended up throwing this one away, and I LOVE reggae. Save your money and get something else, trust me."
5,The best performance!,"I own a copy of this performance in LP form. In college (@1980) I must have listened to it 200 times. It was always my favorite. When cd's came out I was disapointed that I couldn't find this edition. I've listened to many renderings of this concerto since cd's have made their appearance. None made it to my favorites stack. Other performers sounded so perfunctory, with none of the nuances that Serkin and the Cleveland Orchestra have, so I decided my memories of the piece were better than having to listen to second-rate performances. When I found this, I ordered several to give to my musician friends who value music played well. To me, this is the best performance on record. I am familiar with almost all of Brahms' works and I believe he would be proud of this recording."
4,Enter: Neji Hyuga,"okay, okay, i get it. this isn't about Neji-kun, but any episode where he shows is great for me! naruto and company head for the chunin exam, which is where the series really gets into its stride and gets good. they meet up with several other Genin teams, including that of my favorite ninja ever,(dramatic pause) NEJI!!!!!! also, my second fave, Sasuke, fights a freaky looking bowl head who has a crush on Sakura. watch and enjoy the insanity!"
5,Yet another amazing book by Knaak!!! - by Adam Laframboise,"The ""Minotaur Specialist"" has yet again created another Dragonlance masterpiece. I`m extremely thankful to Knaak for being the one to mold the Minotaurs of Krynn for readers/fans of them like myself. Like his others Knaak`s way of getting the reader ""so"" intune with the main character was incredibly once again. If you read this Richard A. Knaak all I have to say is ""keep`em coming!""."
3,Dragonlance Book?,"I was not very pleased with this book. First off, the writer used a few words over and over, such as 'arrogant', which was rather annoying. Second, it dragged a little, with pretty much nothing but Magori fights. It lacks variety in words and for some reason, I keep forgetting that this is a Dragonlance book. Since I am a picky reader, I gave this book three stars."
4,Chaos all around!,"As with any book about minotaurs, there's plenty of honor & violence which isn't a bad thing in such cases.This novel has many strengths: a believeable plot twist to get thing rolling(how else did you thing Takhisis would bring these prideful beasts into line without major bloodshed?), great battle scenes(including one involving a god) & memorable characters.I only found 2 flaws: The KOT were a little crueler than portrayed in other books & the length of the book. WOW! While page wise it's no longer than most DL books, there were a LOT of words crammed on them pages. It took me 2 & days of HARD reading to finish it."
5,Excellent Condition!,I was amazed at the excellent condition of this product at the price. No scratched. Played perfectly. I will definitely use Goodwill Books Again! I really like supporting a cause as well!
1,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed with this CD. The rythm and timing of most of the selections is not condusive to meditation or relaxation at all. It is described as healing music- I found the drone and repetition unsettling.
5,Great new talent find,"Sarah puts on quite a show in person, and, after seeing her sing live last summer, I had to have this CD. After listening to it many times since then, I still can't believe that so young a performer could be such a talented singer/songwriter. I look forward to following her career and hearing her next CD, which should be out soon. Sample some of her tunes and then try this CD. This music really grows on you."
4,It's working!,"It's keeping the Hard Drive cooler, but also adds a good inch and a half to the length of the hard drive. It almost didn't fit in the bay that I wanted the hard drive to be."
4,"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Season 2, Volume 2","I liked this one. Packaging of this item should be stronger.The first part of the sets are in cardbord, the last two units are in plastic. the packaging was change at the factory for some resion or another?Too bad that they changed the format. Maybe they will revice and finalise the entire set for the good of the costomer.thanks , have a good one."
4,My favorite season,"This one has the introduction of the flying sub and some Trek actors. Rodger C. Carmel (Harry Muddd) plays a Russian sub commander. George Takei(Sulu)plays an rebel leader. Victor Buno(Villian in many TV shows)plays the android producing mad scientist. Buno went on to the Tonight show to read poetry on a regular basis. He passed on at the very young age of 42.I can't believe there was someone behind a type writer making this stuff up. I marvel at how much Irwin Allen got away with before this was canceled in year 4. Just imagine, it lasted a year longer than Star Trek!Who would of thought how badly this show has aged after the cold war. It had nothing to do with the cold war after season one. I can imagine the depression that must have set in when Richard (Admiral Nelson) was fighting giant lobsters instead of Russian sub commanders. Did at any point, the actors get together and say to Irwin Allen,this isn't what they signed up for?"
2,DOWNHILL FROM HERE,"This will probably be the last volume in this series I will buy. There are two or three decent episodes here, but already you can see the emergence of the ""What got aboard this time?"" cut-rate storytelling that eventually doomed ""Voyage."" In many cases the writing is so hackneyed that character motivations are simply ignored, leaving some show conclusions way up in the air. Of course, the special effects are still marvelous, even though the same underwater shots are frequently reused. Basehart and Hedison do their best, but by late in the second season the cast had been cut back and Irwin Allen was really playing his big audience for suckers. Of course, he pretty much made a career of that. Even so, I guess I'm still a sucker for ""Voyage,"" which I have loved since the sixties."
1,VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA SEASON 2 VOL 1&2,"IT BROUGHT BACK ALOT MEMORIES OF ME AND MY FAMILY ON SUNDAY NIGHTS WATCHING THE SHOW. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE DVD'SVoyage to the Bottom of Sea: Season 2, Vol. 1Voyage to the Bottom of Sea - Season 2, Volume 2"
4,Excellent Family Viewing,If you are looking for something that the entire family can watch and enjoy this show is a good one to use; especially if you like the sea and submarines.It is well written and just a little over acted at times but all in all is a very good show.
5,Classic Irwin Allen,"If you grew up watching Richard Basehart and David Hedison in their adventures each week the way I did, you have to love this series and this is one of the best seasons of the entire series to me. Irwin Allen's classic series complete with that ill-fated flying sub that seemed to crash everytime Admiral Nelson went out in it and the constant worry of the Cold War exploding is such fun to watch today."
2,I could barely detect any strawberry flavor,The jar of this fruit spread that I tasted did not seem to contain much in the realm of strawberry. The overwhelming impression is of apple both in look and flavor. Strawberry is the first ingredient listed and apple the second. I believe this ordering is inverted.It wasn't a bad apple-spread.I suspected that this jar may be mislabeled until I saw that they do not carry any apple spreads.
1,Habitat too small,"I bought this for my daughter thinking it would be a good pet for her. Unfortunately, I did not do my research before buying it. Hermit crabs need space, at least a 10 gallon tank. They need daily care like any other pet: fresh food and water every day. Hermit crabs also have long life spans. A well cared for hermit crab will live 10-30 years. Make sure you want a pet this long before you make this investment.This habitat is too small for any crab. Also it is not constructed very well. The tank gets scratched when you clean it."
2,not very good,"I got this from a local retail store and bought two hermit crabs. its an okay habitat for one crab, but two is pushing it. my crabs were not very happy in their home, though the hut was their favorite thing in the whole habitat.(...)this thing is not durable AT ALL! (careful not to drop it, 'cause i did, and the whole thing cracked and it wasnt fun.) i dont reccomend this habitat"
3,Mouthpiece saver,"The piece is fine, just think that it should come in some kind of container which would protect it from flattening in the sax case."
1,wow is all i can say about this product.,it would have been nice if it came in a package and not the one you ship it in either. i got a big yellow enevelope with this just tossed inside it. another..not worth it product. better off going to a music store and get a packaged one for a little more money
3,Not-so waterproof boots,"The Commando boots are comfortable and provide good ankle support,however they are not waterproof. I discovered this after wearing them the first time when it was raining. If you are looking for waterproof boots, I would recommend only buying a brand which uses a Goretex lining as this is the only material I have found to be truly waterproof."
1,Extremely trite.,The author displays very little knowledge of the scientific issues he discusses; his knowledge of the relevant history is even more spotty. It is a work of distressingly low quality.
2,So close...,"What starts out as an incredible read quickly turns clumsy and stale. Ennis had himself a fast-paced, thriller/horror/action story going here, and he shot it all to hell by late in the second act. Is is a horrible read? Not at all. Alas, it's a clean-cut example of one of those stories that you find yourself editing in your head while you read."
2,cop chases,the picture quality was good but the sound sucked royaly as i bought 1 returned it to amazon they sent another and it was worse than the first one and i returned that one as well
3,Too slow,"I got this for my husband to use while our Bunn My Cafe was being replaced, and it turned out to be a bad choice. It took so long for the coffee to drip through that he could never wait, and took the cup out before it finished. What a mess! Coffee was good, though."
1,grinds in my coffee!,"What a great concept, but with poor execution! I always end up with grinds in my coffee. I don't put too much coffee in the filter (not even half capacity) and I can't see any holes in the filter. Based on what the grinds inside look like after the machine's done brewing, it seems that maybe the water gets pushed out at too high of a pressure, causing the grinds to spray upwards and spill over the sides. Could be that mine is defective? In any case, I do not recommend this product."
1,not worth it,slow brew. continues to drip after cycle finishes. mess to clean up. can't brew a strong cup because filter will overflow and ground gets everywhere.
2,So So coffee maker,"Although I've only had the coffee maker for 1 month, I'm not at all pleased with the way the coffee tastes. I followed the instructions with regard to how much coffee to use, but the coffee still tastes more than just strong; it tastes burnt. I can't explain it but I just don't enjoy the taste. I also tried brewing it with less coffee, but it still doesn't taste decent to me. I find it difficult to want to even use it at all. I'm very disappointed!"
3,Taste compromise,Great Convinence...great price paid $$$ at ..... for use in my office but I could never get a decent tasting cup of coffee. although this product AD boosts a stainless steel cup the picture does not and mine came with a rubber/plastic mug that didn't hold up and made lousy tasting coffee. A stainless steel cup would certainly have to produce a better tasting cup!!
3,"great cup, maker had problems","It makes a great cup of coffee when it wants to. Often there was up to 1/2"" of water in water tank after making a cup of coffee. this extra water would appear in next cup .. sometimes over flowing the cup or just messing up the desired strength of coffee.The number is the same, the reviews seem to be a better design than what I got, but same number. go figure!The travel cup was great, no bad plastic taste .. no drip when drinking.The cost of this now is nice .. I paid Amazon $68 in Dec'09."
1,Great but it won't last longer than 2 weeks...,"I bought this for my brother who drinks coffee everyday. he's always in a hurry so this product is good because it makes just one coffee and no need for filters, even better right? WRONG. the coffee maker's filtration decreases functionality after a while resulting in watered down taste. SKIP iT unless you want bad coffee."
2,OK if you like a small cup,"The concept is good but the cup is too small as in most others. It is deceiving in the picutre; the cup looks to hold more than it does.So, it isn't really something I can use. Glad it wasn't expensive!"
3,"Great little gadget, but don't try making your coffee strong...","I got this for Xmas and keep it by my desk, where I've used it every day to brew 2-4 cups of coffee throughout the day. It's handy and performs well overall. My only complaint has to do with capacity. If you try to put a little extra ground coffee in the reusable filter to make a stronger cup o' joe, you wind up with something resembling Turkish coffee -- lots of mud at the bottom. And after it's done brewing, the coffee grinds wind up permeating every remote crevasse inside, which makes cleanup a real chore.So for you normies out there, this product will work great (3 teaspoons of ground coffe, no more). For us extremists who like it strong, a full-size rig works better."
5,Ditch the Travel Mug!,I have been using my DCM 18 for about 3 years now and am very pleased with it. I found that the Dart Brand 16 J16 ounce foam cup works (Costco) in this coffee maker perfectly. Don't fill the cup too full when filling the coffee maker or it will overflow. I use Folgers Coffee with the screen filter provided and get a tiny bit of grinds with my coffee which I find acceptable.
1,Worst Coffee I've Ever Made,"I got this as a Christmas present last year, and I thought the idea of it was nice, seeing as I'm a working college student who's always on the run, and I was the only coffee drinker in the house at the time. Well, my first problem with this coffee maker was the filter. I usually bought pre-ground coffee, but that was too fine, and I ended up with grains in my coffee. I had to buy whole bean coffee and get it ground so it was less fine. My second problem was the mug. At first,I couldn't figure out why the coffee I made tasted really awful. I tried several different kinds of coffees, expensive bags too. But then I realized,it's the plastic inside the mug. Believe me, you can taste it. I'm sure I could have found a better mug to use with this machine, but at that point, it had become too much of a hassel and I went back to my ol' faithful Mr. Coffee. Sorry, maybe I'm picky about my coffee, but I like it strong and black, without a bit of plastic mixed in."
2,Mine Broke After Four Months,After four months of use mine stopped working. Until then it worked fine. The coffee gets cold if you let it sit for a short while. The mug tray is a bit low to use with other mugs.
2,It makes something close to coffee,"It's convenient, and great in theory, but in practice, this Brew 'n Go falls short. The 'coffee' that drips out is diluted, barely half strength. It's worth it to use my regular coffee pot and have to clean out the carafe every day instead of drinking the coffee flavored water that this makes."
2,Broke after ALMOST six MONTHS,"I was so excited to have received this product as a gift at Christmas!! I registered the product on the website, have a confirmation e-mail that they received it. Two days ago, it just quit working!!! I was astounded that it only worked for 5-1/2 MONTHS!! I followed the directions in the booklet and wrote an e-mail addressing this problem. No response! I guess this is yet another product made somewhere other than the USA!!"
1,Good for dissolving teeth and chewing coffee,"The problem is that this brewer allows for grounds to enter your coffee. Not small ones either, fairly large ones. Large enough that I felt as if I could feel my teeth dissolving. The built in filter was a huge plus for me, but I see now that you get what you pay for."
1,Poor Performance,"for something that supposed to be made by the reputable Black & Decker company, the make of this item is extremely poor. it leaked the first time i used it! in fairness to them, however, what would you expect for $20? The on-off switch is also quite odd - there's no label that identifies which direction you need to push the switch towards to turn the coffeemaker on, and you don't know if you'd actually activated the item until it starts to gurgle the hot liquid into the cup. it also made things worrisome when i attached a timer to the item so the machine would turn on in the morning - the on-off switch did not stay turned on, so of course i woke up to a cold, empty cup in the morning. suffice to say i gave the item away to someone who might be able to find it useful."
1,This thing is a piece of junk - Zero stars if possible,"This is a poorly made, poorly thought-out product. There is no valve between the grounds and the cup - just a hole. If you are not careful, you can overfill the reservoir - it will hold more water than the cup will - but there's no ""max fill"" marking like others have. That was a great engineering decision. Do that, and you'll have hot coffee all over everywhere. If you remove the cup before you get rid of the grounds, they will continue to drip down through the hole and you again end up with coffee mess all over the place. So your choice is to (a) let the thing drip after you remove the cup or (b) try to remove the steaming hot grounds immediately. That's fun. Now forget that you didn't previously decide to incinerate your fingers by removing the grounds immediately, put the cup back in for another round and you track little coffee circles from the bottom of the cup everywhere. This thing's going straight into the trash."
2,Coffee Lover? Don't bother with this one.,"If you really enjoy your coffee, but think you can handle this little maker for emergency, travel, or office/workshop, it may NOT be worth a try. However, at less than 10 dollars, you can get coffee out of it and by using an additional filter and strong beans, you may be able to slow it down enough to get a half decent cup. You can use your own cup if the plastic one included doesn't suit you. It is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick, weak coffee one cup at a time."
2,Black & Decker DCM18S,I didn't like this item from the beginning. It's really built cheap. I ended up buying a Keurig and it's great.
4,Perfect,"It was just what I wanted; works beautifully,quickly and provides and excellent brew without having to waste the remenants of a pot, which we never finish. One cup at a time is just right."
1,Only worked for a week,"I bought the coffee maker at K-Mart. It was great for the week it worked. I bought it on a Wednesday, used it everyday (5 times), but by the following Tuesday it wouldn't turn on. I have read some similar reviews here on Amazon, so I am not sure if the majority work fine and only a few malfunction...I am returning it, and won't be buying another one."
5,great little coffee maker,i bought this maker for work i'm a security guard and i'm awayn from my desk for a little bit of time every hour so leaving a big coffee maker with a hot plate just could not be this is perfect begening to put away maybe 10 minutesif i only drink 1 cup no throwing away of left over coffee and it shuts itself off no worrys about did i forget to turn it off i do use it everyday and it works great i would and will buy this product again after all it is a coffee maker and it won't last forever
2,Not what was expected,"The main reason I picked this one cup brewer over others. Was the mention of stainless steel cup. I've been trying to have only glass or stainless steel in anything I eat or drink out of. Well, when I opened it up, there was only stainless steel on the outside of the cup. To me, that is deceptive. Why have stainless steel on the outside. All that does is really show the fingerprints on the cup. But if you don't care what your food or drink is in. Then, it works good. Coffee tastes ok."
3,good machine,I am generally happy with this machine. It tends to overflow if I put too many grinds in the filter though. easy to use and good tasting coffee.
2,This used to be such a good product,"This coffee maker used to be so good. It used to deliver a great cup of coffee. However, I suppose all good things must come to an end.I recommended this coffeemaker to my friend who is single and isnt going to be drinking 8 cups of coffee in the morning before work. We took this home ran a cup of straight water through the machine, cleaned all associated parts and filters and then attempted to make some coffee.The machine worked fine, however this was the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It tasted burned and weak (I have no clue how you could have burned weak coffee!). I thought this was a fluke and tried another cup. Same burned weak taste. I tried adding more coffee, ok now its regular strength and burned tasting.I have 2 of the older versions of this coffeemaker at my house and they've been nothing short of a delight for me. I am hoping that my friend's coffeemaker is nothing more than a defective product and not consistant with Black and Decker's product."
3,Sounds better than it is,"I love the concept of this little coffee maker. It is convenient and quick, perfect for my needs. The problem is the mess it creates. The water is distributed so fast and hard it spills the coffee grounds over the sides of the filter. After every use I not only have to wash out the permanent filter (no big deal), but also the water reservoir and setion which holds the filter and basket. This product flaw makes ""convenience"" a misnomer. My husband has a one-cup Mr. Coffee in his office and although it is slower to brew, there is no mess."
1,major clean-up hassles,"This would be a great product except that it spreads the used grounds all around the inside of the machine, including into the water resevoir, making for a major clean up project for every cup of coffee. Yes, I used the recommended amount of coffee. Sorry, not very impressed."
5,Great item to have and to give as a gift,"I really like this little coffee maker--love the built-in filter, and love the convenience of not only making coffee; but teas or just warm water for a cup of lemon and honey. It is so easy to clean and pack in a suitcase.You will NOT go wrong on this one. For about five years now I've been using mine almost every day, it still works great!"
2,Nice idea but poor product,This item has been the perfect item for my wife since she really wants one cup of coffee first thing in the morning. Problem is that it is messy and it's not built very well. My wife has bought probably 4 of these things and she wears them out in 6-9 months. As soon as we find a better one cup maker we're switching.It's really disappointing to have such a perfect item for your lifestyle but have it turn out to be so poorly manufactured. Black & Decker has nothing to be proud of here.
4,Perfect for me.....,I read the reviews before I ordered this and it is all that I need for my occasional hot drink....super easy to use and quick!
2,My Second One Still Works...,"Great idea, but poorly implemented. My first one worked ONE TIME, then refused to turn on again. B&D's customer service wanted to charge me [$$$] to replace the unit (""Yes, it is under warranty - the charge is simply for shipping.""). I don't think I've ever paid [$$$] for a single cup of coffee, and after several emails back and forth with customer service I had given up. Unexpectedly, a new unit appeared in my mail. It has worked for several months now. Coffee grounds are nicely distributed around the insides of the unit by the steam as the brewing ends - nearly impossible to clean throughly. On the plus side - the unit brews good coffee (dependent, of course, on what you put in it) and the mug does a good job of keeping the coffee warm."
2,Taste is an issue,"Yes it fits perfectly in my cubicle thanks to its compact size, yes, it is easy to use, yes it makes coffee, but no, the coffee does not taste good. This is my 5th try and for some reason the taste is still strange. I'm using my favorite coffee brand so i can only assume it has something to do with the way it heats the water or who know what else. It's a shame! :("
3,I'm disappointed,"I ordered it because sometimes I like a cup of coffee on the run, and I don't want the hassle of washing and brewing in the big pot. But- it takes a long time to brew, and the coffee runs over the top of the plastic lid, instead of into a specific hole, and the mug fills up on the inside. Not what I expect from Black and Decker."
2,Too Bad,"I usually do not write reviews however I had to this time. I have one cup of coffee each morning and this seemed like the solution to waste. I read most of the reviews and decided to go ahead. I am disappointed in this product. I will say that I like my coffee strong (stronger than most) so this is not the coffee maker for me. To get a strong cup of coffee I had to fill the filter almost all the way to the top and then each day I had to clean not only the mug, but the entire coffee maker as well. It has to be the fact that there are multiple holes where the water comes out into the filter that causes the spillage. The only thing good about this coffee maker is the mug. This coffee maker will be good for someone on the go who does not like strong coffee."
4,Brews coffee,"I like the fact that it has reusable filter. I didn't like the fact that the stainless steel travel mug was plastic lined. But for around $15, you won't get all the bells and whistles."
3,Great coffee maker but the cups lid leaks.,"Been using this coffee maker for 3 months now. The coffee maker works great but the lid for the mug is way too loose. It leaks when you turn the mug up to take a sip. If you don't suck where the lid meets the cup after you take a sip coffee will dribble down your shirt. BAD MUG!UPDATE: There are complaints of the coffee not being filtered properly and coffee grounds overflowing into the fill reservoir as well as other parts of the coffee maker.This usually occurs when the coffee has been ground too fine. I like to try several different types of coffee so I will keep a running list of coffees that will work well with this and ones that wont. If you are considering buying this coffee maker and regularly drink coffees that I have listed as ""BAD"" you will need to buy whole bean and ground on your own so that you can control how coarse/fine the coffee is ground.Here is what I have so far:Dunkin Donuts: GOODArcher Farms: GOODSeattle's Best: BAD"
1,Not happy,"I have had B&D one cup makers before and they were durable and lasted years. The one I had was 15 years old - leaked a little but still worked. I wanted this one just because it had the larger ""go cup"" and one could use a taller cup with it. The down side - it lasted two weeks - then toast. So this is where B&D quality has gone."
4,"Great coffee maker, mug can be better","I've had this coffee maker for a whole year. I make coffee with it every day. Will brew coffee in two minutes - nice and easy. You want to use paper filters or there will be some coffee ground in your mug. The mug comes with a cover with a hole on it, so you can sip with the cover on, but cannot totally seal the mug."
3,blocked filter drain,An ongoing problem with this coffee maker is that the coffee grains plug up the drain hole for the mug. This has happened many times and sometimes never really drains out or you must wait an extremely long time for it to do so. Our solution has been to trim what conical filters we had and place it in the supplied filter. It works great. The coffee is very good except for this.NCB
5,Get this if you're a solo coffee drinker.,"Since I'm the only one in my family that drinks coffee, there is no use in lugging out the full-size coffee maker. This is the perfect-size machine for a single coffee drinker. It gets your coffee hot and clean-up is a breeze.The warning I give is that if the filter is not properly seated into the drip spout, you will have a mess. Other than that, I love it."
2,OK while it lasted,"I bought one of these about 3 months ago. Produced coffee as advertised. Then it started to leak water from the tube that brings hot water from the heating element to the drip head, back into the water reservoir...Great, it is under warranty. The warranty requires that I pay $7.50 shipping costs for a replacement. Renting one of these units for $7.50 each three months isn't a very attractive proposition. I think I'll move on to something better."
1,B&D doesn't make these units anymore,"Please note that Black and Decker doens not produce these units any longer despite their name being attached to them. The consequence of this is they will no longer stand behind these small appliance products.We have a unit that turns itself on spontaneously and is an obvious safety hazard, but B&D will not stand behind the product. If the product had some name that I never heard of I would not have purchased it in the first place.DO NOT BUY"
1,Not user friendly,"Black and Decker should be ashamed of themselves for this coffee maker. It's a great idea, in fact it's the only one cup maker I've ever been able to find. The problem is that it is so poorly designed. If you're not really careful when you put the filter mechanism into the slot, the spout where the water comes out will not be seated properly and you will end up with coffee all over your kitchen counter.The inluded travel mug lasted about 4 months of normal daily use and then the bottom cracked and fell out. I'm being totally serious. What a mess."
2,Weird smell - Weird taste,"This coffeepot is barely OK. The cup has a really strong new plastic smell - I ran it through the dishwasher twice and keep soaping it in really hot water, but it still makes the coffee taste weird (I also keep running the coffee pot with plain water in case the cause is the maker as well). I have yet to enjoy a cup of coffee from it, I deal with it, but with every sip I think of how weird it taste. Also it makes LOTS of noise brewing. I have it at work in my cube, it is NO secret when I am percolating. If I were doing it over again I would spend a few more $$ and get a better pot."
4,Works great!,"This product works well and creates a nice cup of coffee. It may take a minute to figure out the exact measurement of coffee you should use, but once you do, you'll love it. Very convenient for the office."
2,Mug Plastic inside,"The mug is plastic inside (I thought it was stainless as advertised). Also, if you use a normal size coffee mug it splatters all over the counter. So, you have to always use the travel size mug. The black color also shows spots where the water was located or drips. I would not purchase this item again."
2,Good while it lasted,"I purchased this about 3 months ago and used it maybe twice a week. Today it gave up the ghost and stopped turning on. I took it apart but couldn't find anything obviously wrong. For a $17 product, it's hard to justify spending any money to fix it, so to the trash it went."
4,Perfect for a college student,"This coffee maker is really awesome and is a must have for any college student.What I like about it is its really small. It doesn't take that much space at all.I also like how fast it brews. It takes about five minutes and I have a perfect cup of coffee.Another thing that is pretty cool is the permanent filter. I was in awe when I saw this thing.The only thing I don't like is how small the mug is. I was expecting something a bit bigger, but it gets the job done.All in all, I would definitely recommend this product to any coffee lover. It brews really fast, and it will save you so much money in the long run. Money well spent!"
1,Sadly Disappointed,"I purchased this item the first week of February, 2011. I was quite happy with it the first few weeks, using it at various times to make my single cups of coffee each day. A week ago it quit working. It was brewing a cup of coffee and stopped halfway through the cycle, never to brew again! It is an inexpensive item and not worth the cost or hassle of returning it.I thought I'd found just what I needed but ya get what ya pay for!"
1,Not worth it!!!,"I bought this less than 6 months ago because I wanted to save money... and now I need to replace it. Bummer, bc i love it in theory but in practice it was not worth it at all."
5,Love it!,"I've only had it a week but so far I love it. I bought it for the office where I didn't want to share the grungy old community pot or my expensive coffee beans. Brews a cup in about 3 minutes. I don't like the mug that came with it because it's got a ridge around the lip of the mug that's a little uncomfortable on my lips, so I use a ceramic mug that's a little shorter and wider and it works fine. Some reviewers said to buy paper filters but I don't see the need. I grind my own beans with a cheap little Mr. Coffee grinder, making sure I don't grind until powder consistency, and no problem! When I clean my mug I rinse the permanent filter and filter basket. Takes less time than cleaning a coffee pot which is a nice feature. The machine turns off by itself which is another nice feature. All for less than $20. Love it!"
3,Missing my coffee,"I loved the product - when it worked. It's a great little coffee machine and the coffee it brews tastes fine - better then most restaurants or your regular office coffee. Unfortunately, the brewer stopped working after a couple of weeks of use. I ordered a replacement in hopes of better longevity of the product."
2,This coffeemaker quit working early on.,"The coffee maker worked fine for about two weeks, then suddenly it stopped brewing all the water in the reservoir. Now, instead of 2 cups it brews about 1 1/2 cups. It sucks!"
2,DIDN'T LAST,"I had good results with my coffee maker. Made a decent cup of coffee quickly and was easy to clean and use. After about a months use making 1 or 2 cups a day it died. Coffee maker employs two thermal fuses in the heating element circuitry, mounted on the heating tube to prevent overheating and a possible fire hazard. I have read other reviews where the coffee maker turns on by itself, which would be a real problem if there was no water in the coffee maker and no fuse to limit the temperature, I suspect this is what happened to mine and caused the thermal fuse to blow. I disassembled mine out of curiosity and the fuse was indeed blown. Now I know why the tell you to unplug the unit when it's not in use. Judge for yourself, if you unplug it when it's not in use it would probably last a while. It IS very inexpensive."
1,nice while it lasted,I loved it until it failed... It lasted 2 months. A tiny dohicky in the water tank broke or came loose. I put it back in place and it worked for a few more times then was lose again. All the other similar ones seem unreliable too according to reviews. Maybe I'll try one of them...
1,Replacement unit didn't last either,"Great idea - my husband loves brewing his own cup at will. The first one pooped out after three months and the replacement unit just gave up the ghost. I suppose $20 for 8 months of use (only one cup per day) is fair, but what a pain in the neck to have to keep replacing it. I'm on to a different brand this time. I'd rather pay more and have it last"
1,Don't bother!,No longer works after a little over one month of use! Since I only drink 1 cup of coffee each morning I thought this would be ideal. Started using once a day December 25 and by Feb 2 it no longer works. Don't waste your money.
5,JUST LOVE IT!,"This is a great coffee pot, you get good quality hot coffee in a matter of two minutes... Just what you need as you wake up getting ready to go to work. Great product!"
3,It brews me a fast cup,"I like this item for alot of reasons. It's priced right. It's fast, doesn't take up alot of space. Easy to clean afterwards, just rinse 2 small removeable parts, no paper filter needed. Shuts off automatically when finished brewing. What I don't mind doing is when it auto shuts off, I tilt it slightly forward the to get all the coffee out. I want get every last drop. I do it 2 or 3 times so that when I finally remove my cup there will be no drip left. It brews me a cup of coffee in less than 3 minutes from the time I push the start button."
5,GREAT little coffee maker,"If you like one 16 ounce coffee at a time...buy this! I am using one, and have two unopened in the closet. I use it every day taking coffee to work. Works flawlessly. Simple to clean...few seconds. Saving the other two for myself, or gifts. Very inexpensive, buy two, get free shipping....worth it."
5,Works well,"This thing makes a HOT cup of coffee. Works perfectly for what I need. Only wished it came with a measuring spoon, otherwise its perfect."
4,Good appliance,"Shipped quickly and arrived in good shape. Easy to clean and use. Really like the mug that came with the unit. Only issue and it is minor was the strainer. Tended to be a challenge to get clean and there was occasional minor spillage of coffee grinds, very little and it did not affect the taste or quality of the coffee."
5,Perfect for me!,I love that this coffeemaker takes up such little counter space. The permanent filter is very nice in that it eliminates the need to try and find the right filter size. The only thing I had trouble with was the amount of grounds to put in but I'm guessing that the problem is with me since I have not made a lot of coffee. Other than that I couldn't be happier. It's so awesome that I had to buy a second one for my mom.
5,B & D Brew 'n Go Coffeemaker,"I gave this coffeemaker to my sister-in-law for Christmas. She said it works just great and she really likes it. The permanent filter works well, so no paper filter is needed. Since it does not use the coffee pods, you can use whatever coffee you want, and can adjust the strength to your liking. Great little pot for someone who justs wants one cup of coffee!"
2,broke immediately,The lid on the water container broke immediately upon use. Also the coffee just doesn't taste very good. I think that I could have dealt with by experimenting more with ratio of coffee to water but the lid breaking was very disappointing. I like the concept of this coffee maker though. I needed something to bring to work and I liked having the mug already built in.
4,"Works Fine, Auto Shut-Off A Big Plus","This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise."
5,5+ years and still brewing great coffee,"I have owned a Brew and Go for at least five years and have brewed at least two mugs of coffee in it every day. It is still doing a great job. The perma filter did get a hole in it a few years back. For awhile I was using the #2 cone filters, but one day my local grocery store was out of #2's. I bought the small basket filters instead (much cheaper) and just fold in the excess to make it fit in the basket. Works great! I use the mug that comes with it to measure my water and brew into, then pour from that mug into whatever mug I am using that day. I like my coffee bold, so I use 3 tablespoons of ground coffee and I have not had a problem with grinds in my cup, unless I spill some between the filter and the basket. By using the mug to measure the water, I have not had any problems with overflow."
5,good cup of coffee!,Just received this yesterday. We got it to replace the one that we have had for at least 20 years. That one still works but it is slowing down a bit. The two are designed very similarly except the new one accomodates a larger cup a good sized travel mug is included). The devlivery was very quick. We received it before the predicted date.
5,Love my brew'n go,I only drink 1-2 cups of coffee & had one of these 10 years ago misplaced it moving & really missed it. I've gone thru 3 regular coffee makers in 5 years & wasted way too much coffee in the regular coffee pots. This is perfect for me it makes 1 cup very quickly & I don't waste coffee. The travel cup is very handy if I just want to brew'n go I just love it.
1,Not a good choice,"I bought one of these after my mother got one as a gift. It was great. I did not clean it properly or often enough so after about 2-3 years ordered a new one. It came and one of the feet was broken. Returned to Amazon and they sent a new one. This one will not brew a complete cup of coffee on one flip of the switch. It takes about 3-4 and then all the water does not come out. I did not return because it was ""used"" at this point. Will definitly look at another brand of coffee maker now."
4,Great for College Student,"I typically wake up about 20 minutes before my class and don't really have time to waste making coffee. However, with this handy-dandy machine I can have hot coffee with the click of a button in less than five minutes (I timed the coffee-making process and you go from empty mug to piping hot coffee in 4 min and 30 seconds!)This coffeemaker makes the same quality coffee as would your run-of-the-mill coffee brewer. The coffee is extremely hot, which is a good thing. However, I typically end up waiting about 10 minutes before actually drinking my coffee. It is quite enjoyable to just hold the hot mug in your hand though- especially when it is cold outside.My only complaint is that occassionally the permanant filter lets through some grounds residue. This accumulates at the bottom of the mug and the last sip or two of my coffee will be gritty. This is bearable however with all the other pros that come with this nifty piece of brewing equiptment!"
4,Didn't know I could make tea using a coffee maker,"Works great. It is quite handy. I am not a regular coffee drinker. I have most of my coffee at work. So when I'm home and feel like having some coffee it comes pretty handy. I am a more regular chai drinker, usually in the evenings. I don't need to soak the tea bag too long. I just put the tea bag in the mug and by the time the hot water fills the mug, I am ready to add sugar and latte."
5,What a little gem.,"This coffeemaker was everything it said it would be and more. For a single cup of coffee this machine is fast, easy to use and small enough to fit comfortably on your counter top without taking up too much space. The non-disposable filter adds to the efficiency and speed of this machine, and means that after a quick rinse you are ready to go again. Pour a cupful of water in, add a spoonful of coffee grounds, place the mug in position, flip the switch and your cup will be ready in 3 minutes! Recommended for a smaller sized kitchen and those of a fast lifestyle (great for students), could even be hidden easily on the corner of an office desk..."
1,"Poorly designed and made, cheap plastic...","I am very disappointed by this coffee maker. I ordered this because my 10-cup one broke. I chose this model because I'm the only one in the house who drinks coffee. I thought, ""personal coffee maker, what a great idea!"" The picture looks like a nice, space saving design, with a convenient stainless steel mug. When I received this in the mail, the first thing I noticed was how light the package was, but still, I was excited to open the box. Wow what a disappointment. The plastic is really cheap looking with uneven rough edges. That stainless steel mug, it's cheap plastic on the inside. Overall the whole thing felt flimsy and cheaply made. Even the packaging was flimsy, random pieces of different sized styrofoam and cardboard stuck inside I didn't even bother to brew a cup to test it out, just so turned off by the whole experience. I'm definitely returning it."
2,chemical smell and taste from brewer and mug,"I was really happy to have received this as a present this year as I am the only coffee drinker in the house. I like the fact that it turns itself off after brewing and the convenience is appealing. However, the plastic/chemical smell in both the unit and the mug has persisted despite numerous washings in hot soapy water. I have twice run straight vinegar through the brew cycle and have even tried brewing baking soda water; neither approach reduced the smell in the unit. The odor from the the mug is so upleasant, I don't use it at all--even so, I noticed that my brewed beverage (coffee, tea) has a very unpleasant chemical taste even when brewed into a glass mug. I haven't been able to find information on the type of plastic used for the unit (i.e., BPAs?), but the persistent smell and taste impact my confidence in its safety.Two stars: great idea, questionable outcome."
1,Good while it lasted,"While it works it makes really good coffee, really fast, the problem is it only lasted 2 months, had to throw it away today, what a waste of money."
5,great coffeemaker,"i ordered this coffee maker from amazon, but it was something wrong with it did not brew hot coffee and also all of the water was not brewed, i sent it back,amazon payed for the shipping, and they sent me another one next day shipping, i am very pleased with amazon, and how they stand by their merchandise, i love this little coffeemaker,it brews only enough coffee for one person, and does it very quick."
5,So far so good.,"Some users seem to have problems with this coffeemaker. I like it fine. One reviewer even complained about it leaking brewed coffee. It seems pretty sturdy to me. No glass parts to break. Paper filters, #2, can easily be used if you don't like the permanent filter idea. I recommend it for those who want to brew one big cup."
2,Thought it was a great idea,"The cups are great - but it constantly overflowed, the water got stuck in the filter and the machine just didn't function well. Maybe one out of ten times the machine worked like it was supposed to."
5,Perfect for work!,"My company always has the worst coffee in the breakroom, so I decided to try out this little coffee maker. It stays on my desk at work, and now everyone wants to use it too! It works great, the mug is a good size for me. I usually only drink one cup a day anyway, but this little thing is pretty quick. The filter is easily cleanable and the machine is so simple to use. I highly reccommend this product!"
4,Good product overall,Overall it's a good product for the money. My only preference would have been that the wide part of the reservoir would have been on the right instead of the left as most people are right handed.
5,Affordable Product Brews GREAT Coffee,"I bought this product several months ago, when I decided to limit my coffee consumption to one GREAT mug per day. Not only does this coffee brew my favorite Starbuck's variety quickly and well, but the mug lid fits tightly (and I've accidentally knocked it over more than once), and it fits in my car beverage holder. It cleans up very easily (another big plus for speed), and is unobtrusive on the countertop. And it's a steal. Better than I could have hoped for at this price."
3,Overall a great product,"I agree with some earlier reviewers about the weird taste coming out of the travel mug. So I stopped using it. I love the coffee produced though and now just use a regular, ceramic mug instead of the travel mug. Another drawback is that once in a while the volume of coffee produced is 1/2 or maybe 2/3 of the water I put in. Other times it's the full amount. This has been happening ever since I got the coffee maker. But as far as the taste of the coffee (assuming you're using a decent quality coffee, I use Peet's) you can't beat the quality and the price of this maker. Overall I'm quite pleased with it and I'm thinking of getting another one for the office.*** 1/2 stars"
5,Black and Decker Personal coffee maker,"I purchased the model with the stainless steel travel mug. I'm the only one in my household that drinks coffee and this is such a great idea! I love this little machine. I buy the Dunkin Donuts ground coffee, brew it in my personal coffee maker and save time and money- tastes just like I bought it from the store. For the price, this is a great little coffee maker."
4,Black & Decker vs Keurig,"After replacing two Keurig models I found this gem. Used a #2 filter folded over and it's a great machine, no grounds on top of lid. Best $27 I ever spent."
5,Does the job!,I can't have a big coffee maker at my work space. This little toy does the job and the travel mug is a nice feature too.
4,coffe maker review,"The Black & Decker Brew ""n Go has worked well. I just wanted an inexpensive way to have a cup of coffee at work, & this fits the bill!"
5,Best little coffeemaker!,"I started with Starbucks Bistro, but like this one better. The Bistro was way more expensive and hard to find reasonably priced mugs. I liked the B&D so much, I ordered a second one for my travel trailer. It's easy to clean and with paper filters (#1s)it's a snap! More expensive is not always better. When all is said and done, hot water is hot water--it's what you put inside that makes the difference."
4,always fresh coffee,"I had an older model of this item and liked it alot, so I ordered a new one to have my fresh coffee. This model is not as user friendly for pouring in the water--I seem to spill alot of water when loading the water in the coffee maker. Oherwise it's great. Doesn't need filters--a nice option. You can use your favorite mug instead of the travel mug that comes along with it. I do that most often, but can have it to go if necessary."
4,good for your money!,"You can always count on Black & Decker products!! After trying other brands and returning them twice, and reading up on reviews on this product that some of you have written here, I finally decided this was the one. This coffee maker does what I need. The single cup of coffee that is quick, and to go!! I am using the paper coffee filter with this product and that... is quick to dispose ..."
2,"Good idea for a small coffeemaker, but.......","Purchased Brew'n Go in September 2010, it worked fine until January 2011, now it is dead! Four months of working...$5 per month, NOT WORTH IT!Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug"
3,filter runneth over,"Makes a decent cup of hot coffee, but, unless I am doing something wrong, the coffee grinds just are a mess in and around the filter after water runs through. I have to wash out the entire unit after each brewing."
2,Quit working shortly after I got it...,"Worked great for a couple cups of coffee. Then, it would not fill the cup up completely. I tried to find someone to call about the warranty, but never could get ahold of anyone who knew anything about it. On the plus side, I still use the included coffee mug; it works well."
4,pretty good,"this product is easy to use and clean. it heats up any beverage within minutes, making it a fairly versatile product. it will make a cup of coffee, but not a super strong one. if you have a strength preference, this product may disappoint. i have used it to make a quick cup of coffee, tea, hot cocoa, and to heat up apple cider. i'm not crazy about the cup that comes with it- it doesn't keep your drink warm. it is also not very spill proof. i usually make my drink in this cup and transfer it to my travel cup."
5,OMG! But this item!,"I was tired of making a full pot of coffee at work and then making sure I finished it or atleast put it in the frig for the next day. Neither usually happened! Other people at the office all like very full bodied coffees so I've always made my own. Now I make it fresh, drink very good coffee that takes minutes to brew and never waste a drop! Seriously for the price this is one GREAT coffee maker! Even if it only lasted a few months it would be worth the savings in coffee poured down the drain in just one month! The machine is so simple even a man could do it without reading the instructions! No filters needed, cleans easily and makes great coffee - really what else can you ask for - except manybe a day off!Only changes I would like would be the cup not be so thick at the top, even with the drink spout in the lid it is a little too thick."
5,Excellent individual coffee maker,"I bought this for my husband earlier this year, as he's the only one in the house who drinks coffee and wanted to be able to brew just a little bit at a time. He is thrilled with it and uses it every weekend morning. The washable filter is awesome, too. Great little coffee maker for the price!"
4,Excellent Coffee Maker,"I don't like to waste coffee, one scoop for one mug is my speed. It takes about a minute to start brewing once you've pressed the switch, and it is noisy (which I like....lets me know my coffee is brewing). I don't use a paper filter as the mesh basket seems fine to me. Once the coffee is done, I wash out the filter and the pot is ready to use again. Can't get any easier. Well worth the price.Update 10/1/12: Have been using the coffee maker for 8 months now. Still makes a fine cup of coffee. One peculiar thing, you can't use a coffee filter with this coffee maker. I tried it (since I had the filters), and the hot water will overflow while brewing. You have to use the provided mesh basket (without any added filter). The basket works great so I don't consider this any issue at all."
4,A satisfactory Amazon product..Quite pleased,"The B&D; Brew n Go is everything I expected and I am very pleasedwith the product. It has a very good heating element that getsthe coffee hot the way I like it, and makes the coffee at a greatspeed. I've only had it about two weeks and so far, no problems.It is replacing an old Black & Decker that I have had 12 yrs andincidentally, the old one still works, but not quite as well. 12 yrsis very satisfactory these days for anything! It will be great tohave the same lasting quality in this new one and I look forward to that."
5,Kitchen necessity,"For me, a kitchen necessity. Three years ago bought one, the switch died after a year or so. I bought a Toastess TFC-326, not as hot, no automatic shut off.Bought another DCM185, dropped it. Overflows are my fault.I use a blend of 'good' beans (Grinder: Mr Coffee IDS77, really convenient) and Community chicory to my taste.A little difficult to clean the lid hinge of salts (poor local water), but that's cosmetic.I never get to finish a cup anyway, so this serves me well"
3,about what was expected,"Based on the price I wasn't expecting much - just that it works as designed. It does work and I have my hot cup of java when I need it. The con is that I had read all the remarks about the plastic taste and tried to be proactive by working it with just hot water for about 10 cups, and cleaning (with sponge) as much of the internal plastic as possible. Didn't work - the first two weeks I still have the 'plastic' smell, although the plastic taste has been reduced to an aftertaste. Since I'm old Army, it is still drinkable. Note: I am using very expensive ground coffee which I can still taste."
4,Great for single cup,"Makes a good cup of coffee, quick and hot -- what more do you need! Also, saving by not making a full pot and then not using it."
2,Didn't last 6 months..,"*Edited from original review*So originally I rated this coffee maker 5 stars and had a great review about how I loved the cup and lid, how fast this makes coffee, etc etc. Then after not even 6 months of daily use it started giving me problems. It won't ever brew all of the water I put in the reservoir- only a portion of it. Then I have to go back and press the start button down again and it brews a little more, then I do it again, etc. until I finally have a full cup of coffee. I've tried cleaning it, running some vinegar/water through, etc- but it still won't brew a full cup in one cycle. I'm not heartbroken since it was so inexpensive, but I still expected it to last at least a year! I've since ordered a french press to try something different :)"
2,Fun while it lasted,"This coffee maker seemed ideal for me -- the only decaf drinker in an office of ""real"" coffee drinkers. I bought the appliance in August. In October and November, the pot overflowed a couple of times. At the end of November, it stopped pumping all the water into the cup, leaving an inch or two in the bottom for me to take down the hall and dump in the restroom sink. I threw the coffee maker away last week."
3,OK for what it is,"I got this unit to use in my office at work to make a quick cup of coffee. It works well for this purpose - it is fast and easy and the coffee comes out hot.My one complaint is the taste of the coffee - it comes out aggressively bitter with a sort of plasticy aftertaste. And that is using freshly-ground, good quality coffee that makes a great-tasting cup in my french press at home.Lately I have taken to using the unit to heat water for instant coffee, which actually ends up tasting better somehow.Overall, considering how cheap it is, I can't complain, I guess."
3,Good for the office!,"I paid $9.99 and received free shipping so I couldn't go wrong. This brews good coffee. Sufficient to bre a cup of coffee at the office. I'm satisfied. For $19.99, though I would hold off."
3,Good if you need something quick but...,"I always end up with grounds in my coffee. The mug that comes with it adds this awful new plastic taste to the coffee that I can't seem to get rid of. I use a regular china mug with it. This totally defeats the whole concept of ""Brew n' Go"" because then I have to pour the coffee in another travel mug and then clean up. The unit continues to drip until you remove the permanent filter. If you waited until the dripping stopped, well, there goes the time saving concept.However, if I only want one cup of coffee and can just drink it at home in the mug it gets brewed in, it is great. That is not what I bought it for though."
5,Review of Black & Decker One Cup Coffeemaker,we placed this order for this product to replace a similar item that no longer function at 100%. We have been using products of this type for over 20 years. We're completely satisfied with the item we purchased and the service that the seller provided.
1,Not a good coffee maker.,The coffee comes out way too slow on this machine....and you have to be careful about how much coffee you put in. One reviewer made the outlet hole bigger to let the coffee come out faster and he said it made the coffee maker a great little one cup maker. I suspect his theory is correct that the water cannot get through the grounds fast enough and that is what cause the coffee grounds to come out all over the place. Have not tried to enlarge hole yet but will get around to it.
1,Brew 'N Go--DID NOT EVEN WORK,"I was sooooo excited to receive this in the mail. Then, when I tried it out, there was no power. It did not work. It was a total waste of money. I am very dissatisfied."
5,Sooo convenient,"I love my Brew 'n Go coffeemaker. Just add measured amount of grounded coffee and water; turn the power on and water heat up very quickly and you get hot (not scalding ) coffee within couple of minutes.Permanent coffee filter works good. Now I don't have to use paper filters like I use to which is good for environment.How much simpler can it get?Reliability so far has been good. I was using Melitta drip coffeemaker previously. It is more basic, more time consuming and wasteful in that you use disposable paper filter to hold your grounded coffee. You heat the water with tea kettle which will take longer time to heat up. Then you pour the hot water over grounded coffee slowly and then wait for it to drip completely. It may make good coffee but definitely labor intensive and kills time.Just the fact that I no longer have to buy paper filters and saving 2/3 of the time compared to my old Melitta drip system I would say this is money well spent."
1,Want to return!,"After one week of use, it won't brew an entire cup! Waste of money, don't buy it. I have to keep pushing the 'on' button to get a cup of coffee brewed!!!"
1,caffeine free,"The instructions said to run it with water first to clean it, and everything worked fine. When it came to making a cup of coffee, it wouldn't work.This was a gift for my sister who goes to school in England, where it is more difficult to find coffee makers like this, and she was very disappointed. She used the appropriate converters but cannot get it to work again."
3,Pretty good,"I can't seem to get a really great cup of coffee. Maybe I need to make it stronger than recommended, but several folks say that it overflows if you add much more coffee."
1,Stopped working after 8 or 9 brewings,"I liked my office one so much I bought another one for home. It worked maybe 8 or 9 times and then simply stopped working (""Q.C Passed 26""). No explanation other than quality failure. Moreover, its difficult to attempt repair as the plastic bottom is secured by not only 4 phillips head screws but also one proprietary screw (noting in a normal toolkit will turn it). There is no reason for this other than to prevent the owner from attempting repair, and this is simply unacceptably evil. Thank you Black and Decker for wasting my $25, preventing me from correcting your quality problem, and adding volume to our landfill."
4,Works like a champ for under $20 bucks,"I needed a small coffeemaker that could make one or two cups of coffee on a daily basis without having to worry about buying those pods or other proprietary stuff. When I read the reviews about the Brew n' Go I was a little worried that I might have issues with the filter or water heating mechanism, but I decided to go ahead and purchase because the price was so low.I have had my coffeemaker for about two months now and I have to say that I am very pleased. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the coffee cup lid sealed completely to avoid spills and also I find that when washing the cup out, water occasionally gets trapped between the metal and plastic portions of the cup.If you are looking for a cheap, spartan coffeemaker, I recommend picking up one of these machines. Even if mine craps out in a year or so, I intend to buy another one because of the value."
5,An RV Essential !,"Bought for my travel trailer... liked it so much I now use it every morning. Real space saver for the travel trailer, or a great cup of coffee for the ride to work. Simple to use and easy to keep clean. Particularly like the fact you need no paper filters. Perfect for the person who only wants one mug of coffee in the morning."
3,So so.,"Hot water is running fast. Makes ground coffee tasteless. I use starbucks ground coffee. With this coffee maker, I need more ground coffee to make same amount of coffee."
3,perfect for gas station coffee - horrible for gormet,"This thing does a great job for weak coffee with no fuss. I highly recommend it. I really like the travel mug too. If the travel mug wasn't so great this would be a 2 star review. I also like that something in the kitchen is black and decker...funny.Now for the bad bits...filling the dripper over 1/2 way with grounds results in grounds getting everywhere, including in the coffee and making clean up a chore. If you like your coffee strong at all this is not a good product for you. I gave mine away. Keeping the dripper under 1/2 way filled with grounds works great, but the coffee tastes like brown water to me."
2,GOOD FOR TEA,"This is good for making hot water for tea, but coffee doesn't work. I think the water doesn't sit long enough in the coffee grinds or something because no matter how much coffee I use it tastes weak."
1,Total Junk,"After only 3 months it completely stopped working. It simply wouldn't turn on. I'd read the other reviews on Amazon stating the exact same problem, but took a chance on it anyway. My mistake."
5,SPECTACULAR!!! DON'T HESITATE TO BUY IT.,"I was getting ready to buy a much more expensive, one cup coffee maker. But my hang up with K-cup coffee makers is that is very difficult to make strong coffee due to the size available for grounds. Also it is of course very expensive. Anyway, I've had this coffee maker for a couple of months now and it is spectacular and a complete no brainer for the price. You can use as many grounds as you want.... the coffee is VERY hot... all the grounds are wetted. It makes the coffee fast enough but not so fast that the brew is not decent. It is PERFECT for a one cup coffee maker to always have a nice, fresh mug of coffee. I use regular size coffee filters as I am just trying to use them up as I have an excess of them... you can squash them into place. I use the filter as it is VERY easy to clean up after use... This is a GREAT little coffee maker and the price REALLY makes it a no brainer!"
4,"my 2nd one, and if needed, I'll buy another","The choices, in this price range, are limited for cup-at-a-time brewer so we're pleased that this one works just fine for us. If the coffee grinds are very fine you'll want to use a paper filter instead of the one provided. And yes, every few days it needs wiping down because grinds, of any consistency, do get all over. And the seating of the filter/basket is important to avoid complete grind/water spill over; but, it's so obvious how to place it correctly I had to laugh at the 1-2 star reviews complaining about this. You can't close the top if basket isn't set properly.After a about 2 yrs, our first one broke...don't remember how or why, just pulled up Amazon.com and with a sigh of relief, ordered the same one again at the same price!. Now THAT'S impressive. I removed 1 star because I thought it should have lasted longer than 2 years. Still not as aggravating as when our fancy multi-brew took a dive way too early and replacing that was well over 20 bux."
1,R.I.P.,"Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel MugThis is more a eulogy than a review because the product was pretty much DOA. It worked once (poorly) and conked out right after. It was lights out, literally. The light indicating operation never lit up again, and it remained cool to the touch even after hours of being plugged in. The price is cheap, but the quality is cheaper still.Steer clear of this one."
2,Would Not Recommend,"I purchased this one cup coffeemaker since I am the sole coffee drinker in my family. However, it is not as convenient as advertised. The built in filter is great but after brewing you have to unplug the unit and rinse the water strainer completely to get all the coffee grounds that have accumulated on it off. Also, it is not easy to pull the filter out to dump the coffee grounds. You have to pull both the basket and filter out and it is easy to forget and throw the filter out with the grounds. Do not recommend. I will probably sell at a garage sale."
1,Powere Supply,"I didn't realise that it would be only configured for USA Power supplies, as this item was sold in Australia a few years ago and configured for Australian power supplies, and I wanted to update my old one that no longer works. Now I will have to buy a converter and plug to get it to work. Will just buy a coffee maker here and use the mug."
3,Good not great,"I think more description should be added. Also need to mention that if you purchase it for over seas use, you need a power adopter."
1,typical Black and Decker crap,"I don't know why I keep buying Black and Decker stuff. Yes, this coffee maker only cost me $17 on sale at Target, but it only lasted about a month. It just stopped working. Push the button, and nothing. I bought another 1 cupper from Brookstone that cost $40, but in the long run it was cheaper because it still works after 6 months and I expect it will last several years.Oh yeah, one more thing. Never use those permanent screen type filters. They make the coffee taste like crap. It is not a filter, but just a device to keep the grounds out of your coffee. To make good coffee, use a natural brown paper filter, like the Melitta #1, which fits this and all other 1 cup coffee makers that use cone filters."
1,BLACK AND DECKER BREW AND GO.DCM18S,"I was very exited to receive my new coffee maker, but from the first time i used it , it started leaking badly. I tried different amounts of coffee thinking I was using too much coffee. I changed my amount to 2 and 1 table spoon and it worked fine for a few times. Then it all starting happening again and the severe leaking starting again,Don't bother with this one, find a more expensive one that might work. You think this is going to save you time, you spend more time cleaning up rather than drinkingthe coffee."
3,Worked well for 2 years,"I've had one of these for three years, and I've loved it while it worked. For a long time, its only issue was that it had trouble handling too fine of grounds, like the ones my grinder made from whole beans. Store bought pre-ground coffee worked fine.Grounds get into the coffee quite often. I'm accustomed to dumping the last half inch of my coffee so I don't wind up chewing stray bean particles.After 2 years of use, it started putting coffee on the counter through it's base, leaving wonderful brown puddles behind. Over the last year the size of the puddle has grown. Alas, it's time to retire this little machine and pay for something a little higher quality.Compared to other one cup devices, it is remarkably easy to use for being filter free and using your own grounds."
1,Mess,I have one of these single cup brewers. ALWAYS is making a mess and the cup of coffee is forever with grounds in it.Grounds are always spilling out of the filter into the coffee. Black and Decker should be ashamed. This is a piece of junk.
2,The mug is defective,Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel MugI washed the mug by hand and when I was drying it I heard a sloshing sound. When I shook it to try and clear the water out of the inside of it a few drops came out. I do not want to drink out of a mug that has standing water in the walls of it. I will look for a replacement mug because otherwise it works well.
1,Yucky coffee,"This is such a great idea and seemed perfect for my house, where I am the only one who likes coffee. The problem is, it doesn't make good coffee. No matter how fresh my coffee grounds, the coffee comes out tasting burned, watery and stale. I have not been able to figure it out, but after reading other reviews I think maybe the problem was that the coffee grounds may have splattered into the water reserve, and I can never get the taste of old stale coffee grounds out of my new coffee. I finally got rid of it after trying it 10 or 12 times."
2,Leaks every time I use it,"I purchased this for my apartment, figuring it'd be easy to make my coffee before class. First of all, the permanent filter never did anything - all I would get is a bunch of coffee grounds in my coffee, so I started buying filters. A few weeks later, it started leaking EVERYWHERE. Every time I use this now, I have to clean up all the mess it makes and have to make twice the amount because it spills half of my coffee. This is NOT worth the money. Don't waste it."
1,Piece of junk,If there were zero stars available I would have picked it. lousy cup and never did find out how to make a good cup o joe with it.
1,piece of crap,"I bought this coffee maker after rave reviews but I guess I should have read the 1 and 2 stars reviews. The permanent filter is a nice touch, if it worked. Mine came with a huge gap in the filter and duhhhh all the coffee grounds ended up in the coffee. Waste of money. I'm not even going to call the customer service or B&D since the reviewers say its a waste of time and they won't help. I will be returning it...although it'll probably cost me the same amount of money to return it. No use having a crappy coffee filter in my home taking up space. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves...selling shitty products"
5,excellent product,"This coffee maker is great for one cup coffee drinkers. I have worn out one (the swtich no longer works), so I purchased another one yesterday. For the people that complain that coffee continues to drip out after removing the mug/cup...I've never had that happen and if it did, I would just leave the cup under it a little longer. Minor inconvenience in my opinion. I've never had the coffee grinds splash into the water reservoir either. Not even sure how that could happen. I've only had excellent use from my coffee maker. Well worth the money. The first one was a gift several years ago and I used it almost once daily. I guess the switch wore out. Replacing the entire thing is cheap, plus now I'll have more than two cups to use (my original came with two insulated mugs)."
4,It does the job at the right price...I would pay more for programmable capabilities if they were available.,"It is great to use at home where I am the only coffee drinker. The coffee comes out perfect for my taste, and it is plenty hot. However, I would be willing to pay more for programmable features. I would enjoy waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee."
4,Love my brew & go,"Love my Brew & Go! It's great if you are the only coffee drinker in the house. It makes delicious coffee because of the cone shaped basket. No need to buy expensive product-specific coffee. I use store brand coffee and it comes out great! Also, I don't buy cone-shaped filters. I use normal (cheap) filters - fold it in quarters and voila! it's in the shape of a cone!It's also great for people who may forget to it turn it off -- no warmer plate, and the brewer shuts off automatically.My only disappointment is that it only lasts about 2-1/2 years. But at the price, it was still well worth it. I'm about to buy my third one."
4,Good price for good coffee,"This one mug coffeemaker is easy to use and pretty easy to clean up. The Brew'n Go personal coffeemaker makes a good cup of coffee, but it's no Starbucks... If you want to make it a little stronger, just add a little less water. You never have to buy paper filters because of the permanent filter. It's compact, so it's perfect for small apartments or dorms."
4,Great for coffee AND tea!,"I absolutely love this thing! Mine brews very hot (but you can always fill your mug with hot water before brewing to ensure your drink stays hot) and quickly. I use about 2.5 tablespoons of grinds for a cup of coffee, and also use a regular filter instead of the gold (it made a huge mess...probably the grind of my coffee, but I still prefer the paper filter).In addition, the Brew-n-go is WONDERFUL for tea! Brews hot water quickly...I just stick my tea bag in my cup and brew:)Okay, the only downside, thus far, is that the travel mug is 5'' high. I have yet to find another travel mug that is 5'' high! You can always brew in a cup first, but the whole point of this little gadget is ""brew and go"" in one step. If anyone finds a 5'' travel mug somewhere, please post it:) (nice to have two when friends/family visit!).Hope this helps:)"
1,Hope you like grains in your coffee,"I hate this pot. I have tried every which way to keep it from making a mess when I use it but nothing works. When the coffee is done I have to unplug it and take it to the sink, turn it upside down and rinse out coffee grains. Because the grains wash over the basket into the water reserve there are grains in my coffee cup also. I have had it a few weeks and have given it more time than it deserved to get used to it. This weekend I am chucking it in the garbage and getting a new one!!!"
2,Messy With Grounds,"When the brewing is complete and it is time for the clean-up, some of the grounds end up in the water compartment. This requires adding some water, swirling the unit and dumping the grounds solution into the sink. The coffee is OK but the clean-up is the pits. I think the problem is that the brewing water enters the basket too fast and causes the grounds to overflow into the water compartment."
1,"Good Idea, Bad Implementation.","The Idea of this Coffee maker is great: Brew a large cup of coffee for one quickly into a travel mug. The problem is Black and Decker had a very bad design for the filter system. The coffee grinds in this system almost always overflowed. This constantly left a mess, not to mention the coffee was worthless because it was full of grounds. This might be caused partly by the fact that I like using fresh ground beans. The system might work better if you bought Folgers/Maxwell House/ETC. Or this product could probably work ok with tea-bag style coffee bags. I bought this unit for about and it came with two travel mugs. After trying this unit about 7 times, I think I had about 2 sucessful cups of Coffee. The unit worked so poorly, I threw it away."
2,Stainless steel plastic,The mug is stainless steel on the outside and plastic on the inside. If you don't want your coffee in plastic -- and I don't -- don't get this item.
3,Black & Decker Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker,"This personal Coffeemaker is relatively quick and handy, but whenever I make a cup of coffee, the bottom of my coffee mug is always littered with coffee grounds. The coffeemaker utilizes a permanent filter so I can't figure out why the grounds end up in my mug. For this reason, I do not use it very much."
4,super fast shipping.,my dad loves it. i brought it for him and he wanted something affordable and quick. so it gets the job done. it faster than his old fashion coffee filter. i wish i brought it sooner.
4,"Good, quick, hot cup of coffee","My mornings got much earlier this year, leaving me no time to drink coffee before leaving the house. Therefore, I only need one mug, ready to go when I am, not a whole pot to keep filling my cup throughout the morning. This coffee maker provides that convenience and eliminates waste, both of counter space and coffee. It brews very quickly -- maybe five minutes -- but gets very hot and stays hot in the mug for 45 minutes or so. The mug handle is a little flimsy, so I am learning to hold it carefully. The permanent coffee filter and assembly clean in seconds and I can have the next day's coffee ready to brew in just a minute or so. This coffee maker is perfect if you only need one quickly brewed mug at a time."
5,Mr. Coffee Redux,"My officemate has a Mr. COffee unit that is discontinued, but has been resurrected under the Black and Decker name. This product seems to be an improved design of the Mr. Coffee. Easy to use, easy to clean, and all around great performer. Makes one heck of a cup'o'joe."
1,Plastic taste,"I ordered 2 of these coffee makers. The coffee had a plastic smell and taste regardless of how many times I used it. Despite many cleanings, including running vinegar through it, the plastic smell and taste remained. I returned them."
2,Third time and it stops...,"I got the same model and it was easy to set and brews nicely. It's just the right temperature, though I had an issue getting the right amount of water in the reservoir. I have only used it a few times and on the third time I went to use, none of the water would come out, just a LOT of steam rising out of the top and it shut off after a few seconds so I turned it back on. It made a lot of noise and what not but again no water and a lot more steam than before...and now it has quit working. It's great for convenience and whatnot, but it's durability is questionable."
1,What a mess!,"I was so excited about this product, especially since it received so many positive reviews. The first problem is, it takes way too long. After the initiail brewing, it continues to drip for several minutes, so your coffee will start to cool off before the mug is ready to be pulled away. Second, the coffee grounds get all over the place. Today, I even put in less grounds to see what happened, and it is still all over the inside of the machine, even where the water goes, making for a tedious cleaning process each time. And yes, there are grounds in my cup of coffee. This was a complete waste of money."
3,"Works great, no paper filters... but a small cup","I love the concept of this little machine. It's perfect for a house where only one person drinks coffee, and not a pot-a-day. I like the fact that it doesn't need paper coffee filters, you can just rinse and reuse. The only problem with this economical little machine is that only their small-sized coffee mug fits in the dispenser. If you lose it or leave it elsewhere, you'll have to be resourceful to make a cup of coffee that day."
3,Cup Needs Work,"Not a bad little maker. Although the cup is listed as top rack dishwasher safe, water gets inside between the outer metal and the inner plastic lining. I had to bend the handle and drain the water out washing it for the first time."
2,Not worth it,"As with other reviewers, I was interested in this product because of the positive reviews from others. I thought it would be convienent since I am the only one in the house who drinks coffee. I have only used it twice and I plan to return it. This coffee maker is very messy, spilling coffee grounds into the water resevoir and defiling my drink. The coffee is hot enough that the you nearly burn your hand if you touch the stainless steel cup, but unfortunately the coffee turns to a luke warm quickly. I would not recommend buying this product even if you are getting a good price."
3,Makes mediocre coffee,The travel mug is rather flimsy. The machine does not make excellent coffee even with very high quality fresh roasted beans.
3,Stop working after a month,It was great in the beginning. Then about a month after using it everyday it just stop brewing. I read reviews in other places and it appears that there is a small percentage of these do this..... I jot to be the one of them. Black and Decker is standing behind their product and will be replacing it. We have to send back the plug piece and pay $7.00 for them to ship the replacement..... don't really like this.
1,Worked well (for the price) until it broke and then replacement broke too,"This coffee maker lasted me about a year making one cup of coffee most days. Then a small piece that hooks that holds up the piece that fits on top of the filter broke off.I originally still gave this coffee maker 3 stars as it did a nice job until the piece broke off after about a year. If it wouldn't have broke off, I probably would have rated it a 4 star (it takes a lot for me to rate something 5 star). I did mostly like the coffee maker. I ordered the same coffee maker and as I was GENTLY wiping down the machine from the packing materials, the same piece broke off from the new machine. So now I have modified my review to be a 1 star. If you are actually somebody who wipes down your coffee maker (according to the directions), don't expect this machine to last."
3,Coffee Grounds Almost Everywhere,"I received this product yesterday for my office desk. I decided to do a run on it here at home prior to bringing it in. I followed the easy instructions and turned er' on. It took about 7 minutes, and I had my cup of Joe. Flavor: It was acceptable. (Barely). Timing: Acceptable. End result: Marginal. There were grounds in the cup, spewed over the filter area and remaining in the main water area. Would I recommend this: No. PROS: Easy process to get a cup of Joe. CONS: The mess."
4,"Quick, easy coffee. Low quality construction, but good for the price.","I searched amazon for coffee makers, sorted by quality of reviews, and this one came up on top. After receiving it, I've used it twice a day since. The construction of the main part seems decent. The ""permanent filter"" seems to do well so long as I continue to clean it right after using it. My biggest complaint is that the quality of the cup is lacking.When full, I worry that the cup handle is going to fall off under the weight of the coffee. This is just one piece of the coffee maker (an easily replaced one, at that), so I didn't rate it too harshly based on that. It still seems a very good quality for the price and I would recommend it."
1,Mediocre Coffee,"The Brew'n Go Personal Coffeemaker DCM18S makes mediocre coffee. I replaced a Two to Go coffeemaker, and was quite unhappy with how bad the coffee was--so much that took my old one apart and repaired it.I'm thinking that the heating element probably isn't hitting the 180-195 degree temperature.It is nice ergonomically, feature-wise etc. But if my coffee maker doesn't make a good cup of coffee, I don't care about the other features."
3,not the best,"This coffee maker is just okay. I would hesitate to buy it again if it broke.Prosinexpensivesuper easy to usemakes 1 cup at a time and makes it quicklyConsmakes crummy coffeeI'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I can tell the difference between diner swill and the better stuff. The coffee that comes out of this machine is somewhere in between. I think the problem is that the water runs right through the machine and does not spend enough time with the coffee. This makes for a quickly brewed cup, albeit a kind of flavorless quickly brewed cup. I think using little paper filters will fix this problem, but I haven't had a chance to try it out yet."
5,Great product,"This thing is great. I am not a huge coffee drinker but I do like a cup to get me moving on some mornings. With this product I can get that with absolutely no problem in very little time. Easy to use, easy to clean, just great overall. Can't beat the price either."
5,Perfect for 1,I love this little coffee maker. Easy to use and easy to clean. I love the fact that I can use the same drinking mug to fill up the water bin. Perfect for making single cups of coffee with barely any clean up.
2,Cup is half full,"I purchased this coffee maker for work. It does work but...only half the water comes out of the reservoir, then the the coffee maker turns itself off. I have had this for a couple of months,at the beginning it made 3/4 cup of coffee then turn off. Now every time I use the coffee maker it makes less and less coffee. Now I am trying to find an affordable replacement that doesn't use the ""pods""."
3,Puddle patrol,"With the store bought grind the filter will puddle during the 2nd half of brewing process. I tried using a number 9 grind with starbucks coffee, and brewed right through with out filter clogging."
3,It's a simple one cup coffee maker,"This is my first coffee maker of this kind (one cup). It requires complete cleaning after each use. The coffee grounds get into the water tank, all over the filter holder. Besides the every time cleaning, it's an okay coffee maker. If you don't mind left over coffee grounds in the filter holder or having to clean it every time, then this would be a good one cup coffee maker."
1,What a worthless piece of...,Coffee in Thailand (I am living here...from the US) is an expensive proposition. The coffee is expensive..the cheapest coffee maker is over $50 so when a friend was coming to Bangkok to visit me I asked if he could pack along some coffee and a maker. He chose this machine. I read some reviews of it after I knew I was getting this model and this one turned out to be the one that is suck! It didn't use all the water when making coffee...only make 1/8th of a cup so I had to keep pressing the button. Well that was the first cup of coffee. After that I tried a second time in the morning. It made 1/2 a cup and then stopped working!! It is garbage! This really shouldn't even be sold at all! I was waiting forever for some kind of coffee maker brought to me and how disappointing!My advice? NO NO NO!! do NOT buy this!
5,Very pleased!,"I bought this for my son, who's away at college and living in the dorm. They are not allowed to have anything with a hot plate, so regular coffee makers are forbidden. He really likes to have a cup of coffee first thing in the morning, though, and single cup coffee makers at department stores are ridiculously expensive, so I thought we'd try this. He absolutely loves it! He's had this for several months now and it works just as well as it did when he first got it. The only negative is that it only makes one cupful at a time, but the cup is fairly large and when he wants more, he just adds more coffee and water....not really that big of a deal."
