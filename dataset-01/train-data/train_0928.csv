4,"""My Name's Razzle!""","Hey, look- it's FLEA from the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing Razzle! And if you're up on your subcultural history you'll also be able to spot a host of other SoCal punkrock demi-legends.I lovedlovedLOVED this movie when it came out. We (all the little subrban/urban punk rockers who ran in my crew) could recite this movie word for word, and unfortunately, we did- frequently.Yep, the acting is horrific, but strangely enough the milieu, the plot, the location are all 100 percent authentic. Scarily similar to people/places/things/events I've lived through.Now what that says about my teen years is another issue, entirely."
5,I was raised on this movie,This is one of the top 5 all time punk rock movies. Great one liners and horrible acting. The commentary by the director brings it all together... An by bring it all together I mean tottally made me laugh. Of course the story and acting are awful but that isn't really what we watch it for is it...
2,Okay for what it is... but it could have been much more,"Suburbia is based on a real group of Los Angeles punk rockers who lived together in 1980 and 1981, called The Connected (TC); however, only the most superficial aspects of their life are touched upon in this movie. The characters are not portrayed with any kind of depth, and the overall feel of the film is one of exploitation.That said, punks don't have a lot of movies that speak to their experiences, so I suppose this one will have to suffice."
5,best movie ever,This is the a movie that influence me to be a punk. I like the red hot chilli peppers and when flea was in it that was so cool.You will never get board of this movie watch it over and over.
4,Essential Punk,"This was a GREAT flick!!! Especially if you had been part of the punk craze in the 80's. Penelope Sphreeris' first film (I think) she wrote and directed this roger corman project and also appearances by Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Chris Pedersen who didn't do many roles at all, but also had a cameo in Platoon as well as a few other movies. The music was mostly by the Vandals (great stuff!) and the soundtrack music was credited as being by Alex Gibson, but you can hear Fleas unmistakable bass line in the music. Deadpan funny in spots, sad and ironic in places it roughly captures the feeling and energy of the 80's punk phenominon. A must have for punk fans!"
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD","I bought this movie because I saw it on sale at the local Farm & Fleet. It was actually a very good movie and I enjoyed it, I don't care too much about content of the movie itself because I'm sure everyone else will already be reviewing it. I just cared about the DVD itself. The sound and picture is really bad and looks like it was just copied from an old VHS tape. I would expect DVD quality from a movie that has just been rereleased"
2,mediocre again...,"The African drums soften up the harshness of the group, but I'd still rate this disc as average at best. Although the quintet is very talented, the periods in which multiple players are improvising at once are chaos (and not good chaos like Mingus' Moanin). There's too much going on, usually including obnoxious honking or squeaking, and it is very difficult to listen to. As with the other WSQ album I own (Dances and Ballads), I find myself skipping around while listening to it. If you want to hear an excellent all-sax group and are a fan of Charlie Parker (who isn't!?), do yourself a favor and purchase a Supersax recording (I have Stone Bird and both live discs from the Japanese tour and they are ridiculously magnificent albums!)"
1,Heavy and Bulky,"A very... heavy and bulky book. On contrary to its size and many colourful pictures, Taniguchi's architecture represents the typical modern/minimalist architecture with not much of inspiring insight. It therefore is understanble why there are a lot people wanted to sell it on the web."
4,A WAR PACKAGE,"A mix up war packaging of CHARLES TRENET songs ,offers well known songs along with some lesser known;those are often very interesting(PAPA PIQUE ET MAMAN COUD,FREDERICA)to dated(QUAND UN FACTEUR S'ENVOLE,SUR LE FIL).For the record,it is interesting to know that PAPA... was created for EDITH PIAF,but she simply could not sing it, stating that it was too complicated for her;FREDERICA was the title song of a movie.TRENET has often said that during the war years,since the theaters were not properly heated,he settled for movies as a diversion.So to resume,this is a collection that is not bad at all,but for a single cd,one should go for the ANTHOLOGY who covers 20 beautiful songs."
5,excellent product,very comfy to use and makes very crisp/clean cuts in pineapple. i used this cutter to make the pineapple flowers in an edible flower arrangement.
3,Here are the details,"The Warner MOD DVD costs $20, so it's enticing to rent this title rather than buy but there's so little information about picture format (standard vs widescreen) and picture quality (480i, 480p or 720p) that I'm hesitating. Has anyone compared the picuture quality of MOD vs Instant?I rented the movie based Hudak's positive comments. First the good news the movie (story & acting) are as good as I remember from my childhood. Now the bad news, Warner has done Amazon a dis-service by not supplying the recent anamorphic DVD master. The video starts letterboxed (and riddled with artifacts) and then transitions to fullscreen after a few minutes (fewer artifacts, muddy picture quality) this may be a clue as whether a VHS or laserdisc master was supplied to Amazon.I enjoyed the movie enough to consider putting the Warner Archive MOD DVD on my Xmas list.So be warned...."
4,Great atmosphere and another great Lee performance,"Who else but the great Christopher Lee could play the nefarious oriental villian Fu Manchu. Perfect casting, great costumnes and atmosphere. Strongly recommend this film to thos ethat like a little old fashioned mystery"
2,"Just OK, not entirely accurate.","Living in Switzerland and having known some of the people involved, the author presents an interesting account of wartime Switzerland, but does not do a very good job analyzing the facts he has presented. Switzerland escaped invasion due to the deterrent effect of her army ? Not probable. More probable is the diplomatic, strategic and political situation of the country. 60% of industrial output of Switzerland (including chemicals used for manufactuiring of poison gas used in concentration camps), was to Germany in 1940-1945...with no real choice of doing otherwise. So was it an army, probably tough to crush, (but not tougher than Russia's), or the poissibility of having a diplomatic, neutral, semi-""friendly"", country, with banks to put the spoils of war in, to deterr invasion. And why invade ? This would assume Nazi-germany was in a world-invading plan, which facts suggest otherwise."
1,A naive and powderpuff review of Swiss History,This work completely ignores any of the evidence raised in other sources about the Swiss role in WWII. The footnotes are largely from US & UK newspaper accounts during the war as opposed to interviews and eyewitness accounts from the Swiss who participated in the nation's defense. It is a thoroughly unconvincing and weakly written work. Halbrook's premise that Swiss mobilization deterred invasion and conflict is completely unsupportable and very naive.
3,A must read for the ex-patriot living in Switzerland,"This book is a must read for any ex-patriot living in Switzerland or for any tourist visiting Switzerland.It provides insight into the current Swiss mentality and shows how close the Swiss came to being swallowed up by the Germans.The book is a bit technical and tends to focus on the same theme throughout , which at times is somewhat laborious.Overall, a good read and very educational."
4,Well detailed and crafted. Thorough review.,"A well documented and crafted book. It explains that Swiss neutrality during WWII was not accidental, or granted by the other powers in Europe, but was enforced by the Swiss themselves. I fee there are only two minor shortcomings. One is the method the author used to introduce facts and statistics is confusing, as the fact is introduced and then restated, without noting whether the item is a repeat, or in addition to, the previously mentioned fact. The second is I would have appreciated a deeper discussion of how the Swiss stayed out of WWI. I understand that Switzerland nearly came apart, and would have liked more information on how dissolution was avoided. All in all, and excellent book!"
3,"Many interesting facts, but analysis could be better.","The author presents an interesting account of wartime Switzerland, but does not do a very good job analyzing the facts he has presented. He is convinced that Switzerland escaped invasion due to the deterrent effect of her army, but he does not mention or discuss any other hypotheses. The book is poorly edited, with some almost identical paragraphs separated only by a few pages. Nevertheless, the author does a good job conveying a feeling of what the Swiss must have experienced during the war, and provides a chronology of events that is interesting to read."
1,"ONLY 1 FLAG, NOT 2!!","My one star review is based on the fact that the product description clearly states the 2 flags are included in the shipment, however i only received one. If instead I received both flags I would've rated the product high marks as the flag is somewhat nice, okay quality, goes on and off door window easily and even comes with a thing to mount it on a wall instead."
3,Not bad film from legendary director Maddin,Guy Maddin's films are on the weird side like lynch or cronenberg but they hold their own. This film is not too weird but it has its moments. Great performances by Jason Patric and Isabella Rossallini. If you are a fan of his work check it out.
3,What Hearts was a pretty good novel to read,"This was a well written novel.Bruce Brooks did a pretty good job on writing the moral of this novel.But there were couple of things in this story that I did not like. One of the things I disliked about the story was how there was barely any action. Another thing I disliked about this novel was how Asa would wine like a little baby when he didn`t get his way. But I liked about this story was how Asa would react to his stages as they progressed.In every story somebody learns a lesson weather it`s good or bad. In this story I think Asa really knew what the lesson was all along, but then worked around it. If Asa was more mature on his reactions towards the different types of lessons he had witnessed I would have rate this novel five star."
3,Stop pretending you care!,"What hearts is a well thought out book it has a lot to do with being neglected by his mom and step father. I thought this book was depressing. I am a happy person who enjoys smiles all the time. I get mad at myself when my friends get mad at me because i know i would never want someone to be hurt by something I have done. I felt that &#65533;WHAT HEARTS"" isn't a good book for you too read if you are looking for romance, love, friendship, but its a good book if you want too see what others go through who at times are not as loved as much by parents because they don&#65533;t care as much as they need to for their child, they only care about themselves."
3,i kinda liked it! not really!?¿,This book was not my favorite book in the world because i could not understand it. I think that it was to cloded with information i got in trouble with my reading teacher because i did not get a good grade on the accelerated reader test i took on it!(i got a bad grade)
4,i need it....,"I use Kitchenaid stand mixers at a bakery I own and therefore am required to use attachments that fit them. The whisk works fine for about 4-5 months but then each metal strand starts to break off one by one. Now with this said, for home use, I've been totally fine but if you're planning to use it more than 2 to 3 times a week you might consider buying a different mixer...But like I said, for my mixer at home, my whisk has lasted for years, but I rarely use it. If you're planning on whipping up a lot of frosting or whatever... a hand mixer may even work better..."
2,Not dishwashrer safe,"The part that connects the whisk to the shaft of the mixer is made from aluminum, and so will tarnish in the dishwasher."
1,Poorly made KitchenAid 6-wire whip,I bought a KitchenAid 6 wire whip and it was shipped quickly and in it's original packaging. This product was poorly made and broke the first time I used it. I believe the defective whip was not the fault of the person I bought it from. I would not buy another because I feel I wasted my money. I researched the item after it broke and found that the newer ones are prone to breaking though not all of them do.
1,"too big, doesn't fit",Does not fit my Kitchenaid bowl. Too big. I wanted to replace my year 2000 model.
2,Not what I expected.,"When I purchased this book, I was looking for a book that gave some sort of discussion on the role chivalry played in love/intimate relationships. Unfortunately, this book consists entirely of quotes and truisms; the so-called author, who would more accurately be referred to as an editor, did no more than compile a bunch of sayings and quips from others without any commentary. On occasion, the quotes are repeated from previous pages; was she just trying to take up space?There are some color illustrations from medieval art included throughout the book, which greatly enhances the book. I find the art to be about the only thing of value about this book, being bored easily by the uninteresting quotes like, ""Live while ye may, yet happy couple (John Milton).""I would not have wasted money on this book if I had seen it first."
4,Who Needs Guitars Anyway?,"Two-fingered basslines, cosmic wooshes and thunderous Yamaha beats certainly don't make for quality music, but in the case of Alice Deejay's arrogantly-titled ""Who Needs Guitars Anyway?"", it makes for one heck of a party. Fuelled by the ubiquitous single ""Better Off Alone""- arguably the most recognizeable mainstream electronica hit alongside Darude's ""Sandstorm"" and ATB's ""9 PM (Til I Come)""- the album dives right into throbbing club stomps and trife lyrics. It's pure Velveeta, but the thing we Americans fail to realize about these bizarre Euro kids is their willingness to accept that cheese factor and just dance. Take it from that perspective, and you'll find a club record with surprisingly entertaining results."
3,"5 stars for the 3 tracks, 0 stars for the rest.","There are only three tracks on this CD worth anything. Everything else is just OK. If you like ""Better Off Alone"" enough to spend the money, Definately buy this CD, otherwise; Download the tracks off of Itunes."
4,Fun junk-food Europop.,"If you like that, you'll like this. Basically one musical concept stretched out over 50-some-odd minutes, with no pretensions to art. Like the Tom Tom Club said, who needs to think when your feet just go?"
1,Who needs guitars?,"I'll tell you who needs guitars, you gibbering, gurning, witless morons. Proper musicians need guitars. They make real music which has real lyrics which mean something, and proper instruments. This is a despicable piece of filth. It combines all that I most despise in music; disco beats, hi-NRG rave, vocoders, and chart pop filth. Still, at least it doesn't feature Spanish guitars. It is despicable. None of the tracks have proper guitars or drums, and it is a record for gurning hardhouse morons and brainless teen girls who should be destroyed. I cannot believe that even the famously inaane English charts can let this trite, gormless sh*te through the net. It should be banned."
3,"Not bad, not great","Well this cd is definitely not bad. Some of the songs in fact are catchy but they are pretty repetitive after a couple of listens. Better off alone, Back in my life, etc all have a similar sound that gets a bit boring. I saw one reviewer compare Robert Miles, Paul van Dyk to Alice Deejay. This is like comparing apples and oranges. All three are in electronica but PVD is more into trance, Robert Miles- ambient, Alice Deejay i guess somewhere between house and just mainstream music. So in conclusion i'd say, if you've heard a couple of the songs from this album and really really really like them buy the cd. Otherwise just look for cd mixes done by other dj's which include some of her hits."
4,great cd,"I am by no means a big fan of europop or techno. I'm a trance fan. But, I bought this cd because of the reviews and I'm very glad I did. I just got it today and am listening to it probably for the tenth time already. This cd gets under your skin and taps that nerve that is real sensitive to good music. Noone and I mean noone will regret buying this cd.(just sample track 1)"
4,Awesome Dance CD!,"Alice Deejay has a good voice, and the beats of each song are great. Anyone who is a dance fan like me would love this CD. Buy it!"
4,Great Dance Music,"This album is a good buy for any dance fanatic, with a good mix of dance-techno style. The highlight of the CD is ""Better Off Alone"", the catchy and infectious radio hit."
3,Wait....Not that great.,"Well, I wrote a review earlier saying that it Alice Dee Jay was a great CD, well at that time i oly heard the first 2 songs and made the assumption that the rest of it was good. THe rest is pretty much boring with horrible lyrics. Paul Oakenfold, ATB, and various other trance artists have a lot better to offer. ALthough ""Better Off Alone"" is a great song, its better off you buy the single, only and U.S. radios are playing out a good song way too soon. This is definately a good song, that we are already trashing."
5,I know everyone gives dance music 5 stars but....,"Alice Deejay is quite simply awesome!!!! Her voice is great, her beats are insanely addictive. I must say this woman knows what shes doing...If i could afford it i would want her to dj a party at my house. You can listen to this music doing anything. I even fell asleep to it a couple times. NO that doesnt mean im saying its smooth and melodic, because it most definately is not. This cd will have you jumping up and down one minute and then waving your head back and forth in a trance the next. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!! However if you dont like listening to a beautiful voice with addictive back beats stay away."
1,Dumb-Sounding Deejay,"When I first listened to Alice Deejay's ""Better Off Alone"", I thought it had a really cool sound. I became interested with it automatically. Then I heard ""Back In My Life"" on the radio. I liked that too. So, I decided to buy her album, ""Who Needs Guitars Anyways"". Well obvoiusly, I am not happy with this album. Mainly all the songs sound very similar, or exactly the same. You can tell that most of these songs were written in 5 minutes. All they did was write a catchy sentence, found an annoying beat, and repeated that sentence over and over again. It just doesn't seem fair that a group can make an album like this and become rich. Anyone can do what they do on this album. So please listen to my advice. You'll thank me later."
5,Alice Deejay new cd is great....,I'm a babyboomer and love to appreciate great music starting in the 50's when I was a kid. Have cherish great artists thru out the decades to now. I fine Alice Deejay very refreshing and most the tracks are great for listening to get more upbeat when I want to get my mind off of other things. I still believe to be young at heart.
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I bought this CD blindly, I have heard nothing of this group or any of the singles on it, so I was not expecting anything. I deffinately got my moneys worth. The CD is pretty darn good.The beats are awesome, I can hear how this would burn up the floors at raves and clubs. My only complaint is that sometimes the vocals just get in the way.All in all a great debut by a group that has some potential."
2,Mediocre dance music,"There is so much better dance artists around than the dance collective known as Alice Deejay. Amber, Madison Avenue, Kristine W., Sash!, the list could go on. It's not terrible but I wouldn't rank it as high as I would with Madison Avenue and Amber. ""Better Off Alone"" is definitely my least favorite track on this cd while I prefer ""Back In My Life"" and ""Who Needs Guitars Anyway?"". Alice Deejay comes off as more of a cheeseball hi-nrg act like La Bouche (who is better than them) than as fun, bouncy dance act like Madison Avenue. I do see definite potential in them and hopefully will see it in later albums."
3,Great for beginner dance afficianados,"Although this cd contains some great tunes, it is far from sublime. If your into the hard core underground dance grooves, this one is not for you. There are mostly worked and reworked melodic riffs that leave you begging for more and all in all it is quite simple. Great for the small house party on Friday night but far from club capable!"
2,Needed more outstanding tracks...,"ALice Deejay's CD has 2 great songs on it. ""Better of Alone"" and ""The Lonely one"" other than that, it is junk. It sounds like some late 80's early techno. Which isn't that good. The CD isn't worth buying for 2 good songs. Keep your money."
3,You'd be 'Better Off' downloading the mp3s,Only worth buying if you are a die-hard club-style lover. If you like mindless noise like Better Off Alone then this might be your type of thing. This album is plagued by overuse of the 'trademark sound' (like ATB's overused guitar effect). Unfortunately those songs seem to be the better ones and get old fast. A couple of decent songs worth noting are Back In My Life and The Lonely One.
1,Better off with my ear drums poked out,"Cheezy dance music for the masses. That pretty much sums up this connect-the-dots album. If you like this simplistic, trite rubbish, pick up ATB & the Vengaboys. You won't be dissappointed. But if you want the real deal, pick up John Digweed Hong Kong or anything else on Global Underground."
3,It's Ok,"As a fan of euro, goa, and some synthpop. I was impressed by this release. It had 4 good songs.Back In my lifeThe Lonely OneWaiting for your loveNo More LiesThe rest was kind of dull or too cheesy for my taste, but dont let my tastes stop you if you're into this style for the beats or if you like cheesier stuff."
2,"Bare bones production, lame recording, steer clear","Having heard several great remixes of ""Back In My Life"" and ""Better Off Alone"" I picked up the album thinking it would be of consitent, similar quality. Boy, was I ever wrong. this entire album sounds like an 8-track recording, with little more than a 909 thump kick and hat (Boom-tsch-boom-tsch) and ridiculously simple, predicable basslines. Once and a while there's a synth lead that goes nowhere and does nothing, musically or sonically. Seriously, I don't think anyone with a substantial collection of dance records would enjoy this. The remixes are spectacular, but the album really falls flat. I would suggest exploring the Trance[]Control or DJ Tiesto material if you think this is worthwhile. Honestly, this is truly thin and uninspired. I don't understand the warm reception, excpet that perhaps its evidence that the current lack of standards in trance / dance pop really has had a deep affect on the average casual listener."
4,Great night-driving music!!,"This CD is good from start to finish. The standout cuts are 3, 4, & 12. The lyrics and the overdriven bass are the weak points here, but are easily offset by the excellent synthesizer riffs and unaffected vocals. If you like the Pet Shop Boys (up through the ""Very"" album), you will like this CD."
3,An overall pleasing dance album,"Alice Deejay's new album is definitely one for those who can't get enough of dancing. Each song contains a beat that would keep a club going all night. While all the songs contain a very small portion of actual singing, the music makes up for it. I would say the only flaw of this album is that each song is about the same length (give or take thrity seconds), and the dance beats in all the songs go at the same speed. Because of that, all the songs sound more or less the same. But still, it's a very enjoyable album for everyone who loves dance music."
5,Great Sound,"What you would expect from Ernie Ball. The name Earthwood pretty much sums it up. Woody mids, healthy sounding bottom frequencies."
1,Terrible glue,This glue is terrible. It doesn't dry up at all! Just don't buy it! A surface that you want to glue become sticky and that is all!
5,Comfortable somewhat sext sandal,Very comfortable sandal that looks a little sexy!I have had six surgeries on my feet and find this brand very comfortable
3,FYI - Not compatible with Nokia 3360,"This is a fine headset, but I bought mine mainly to use with a Nokia 3360 wireless phone and it is not compatible."
5,The next best thing to world peace,"This headset is the best 10 bucks I've ever spent. The sound quality is perfect (by phone standards) and the set is so comfortable I can't tell that I'm wearing it. The clip-over-the-ear style had me worried about comfort, but now I think it is superior to any overhead style. The mike placement is great, it picks up my voice clearly yet is off to the side enough that I can eat and drink without even realizing that the headset is on. It almost seems like telepathy, talking to and hearing someone distant so clearly, with no handset in your hand and no sensation of wearing a headset!We got 2 of these; my wife has arthritis and holding the phone hurts her wrist. Now she can water the garden while she yaps away. I like to work on my cars while I'm on the phone. You do have to attach the clip on the wire to your lapel to keep the wire from tapping the mike. I usually nitpick and complain about something about every purchase, but none here."
4,Excellent value. But there are better alternatives,"If this is your first headset or you don't plan to have heavyuse, this is as good as it gets. ...the sound quality is goodand it is relatively comfortable. However, if you are going to spend time with this, the Plantronics M175 by far worth the additional expense. Much more invisible from the stand point of the user (you completely forget its on your head) and the listener on the other end. I have them both and switch to the Plantronics unit when I know it is going to be a long call or I going to be moving about."
1,Too small,The mike wand is only 4 1/2 inches long. Since I have 7 inches between my ear and mouth the mike did not get close enough and my voice was too low. It was otherwise comfortable and I imagine it would be fine for a person with a smaller face.
1,They can't hear me,"I was very disappointed with this product.As one other reviewer said the stem is too short. So others can hardly hear me. Obviously, if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product? For instance, ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you? (And I'm short myself, so it's definitely not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions.)But, even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low, though without background noise.I also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment. I don't have a need to wear one all the time, but just for certain calls. I often found myself fumbling to get it on. I think I'll try an over-the-head model next."
2,Broken after 1 month,"At first, the headset was great except it was a little big for my ear. Then after a month, the person on the other end couldn't hear me any more. I recommend you keep looking."
4,Clear and comfortable,"Works well in the car and in noisy surroundings; I've tried several other designs and found that when the mic is further from your mouth, more background noise is picked up due to the increased mic sensitivity required. With this model, the mic is very close to your mouth and background noise is NOT amplified. My wife & I have both settled on this model for in-car (hands free!) and at-home use."
3,"Comfortable, but the wire can get damaged pretty fast...","This headset is indeed quite comfortable. The sound quality is also excellent. But my only problem is that after a while the wire gets messed up from the inside and you get break up during a conversation. But since I got it really cheap using a coupon from UnderTag.com, I can't really complain."
2,Good While It Lasts,"So far I've gone through two of these in less than a year. They sound great and are fairly comfortable(they feel a little flimsy at first but you get used to that) but the are pretty fragile from what I have encountered. Don't get me wrong, I didn't beat it to death or try wearing it while engaging in any extreme activity, they just simply broke from everyday wear and tear. I think its time to invest in something a little more substatntial. The price is what drew me to the at&t head set but I got what I paid for. Kudos however toaAmazon.com for replacing the first one after it broke after only three weeks of use. It was a totally hassle free return."
2,I got what I paid for,"Going on the positive reviews this headset had, I bought it. But it just didn't fit right on my average size and shape ears. It isn't adjustable and fell off many times. If you have the opportunity to try this headset before you buy it, I say GO FOR IT--if it fits you, it's worth all the money. However, this is not a good item to buy sight unseen."
4,"Best sound, easiest for quick answering",I've tried several headsets over the last year and this is definitely the best (and least expensive!). It's very fast to answer the phone by placing the ear piece over your ear rather than fumbling with putting a piece into your ear. I've tested it with friends and it's the clearest for them too. My only wish is that it had a mute button.
1,Terrible transmission,"Nice and light weight but for some reason it garbles my voice unless I put my hand in front of my mouth to direct my voice to the ovedrly short microphone. People complained about the voice distortion so I called my voice mail to check it out. Yep, terrible sound and I am returning it."
1,BOOO!,"ATT made a really good product here. The only problem is that the Microphone stem is about a half inch too short, so noone on the other end can hear me. Literally, if it were 1/2 inch longer, it would rock... oh well"
4,pretty good,it is very good except the volume is a little low ......i found it on ebay for about 8 bucks delivered after i had bought it here.
1,What Do The Three Stooges & Michael Jackson Have In Common?,"What do the Three Stooges and Michael Jackson have in common? Nothing! God only knows why the infamous gloved-one was associated with this book! Pity, I love Curly, but loath Michael Jackson."
5,Simply fabulous!,This pen is perfect!! I was looking for something that I could take to a meeting and easily switch from writing on my Palm to writing on paper. And with one easy twist of my new pen that is accomplished! No more setting down a pen to pick up my stylus! I also liked that it came with a red ink option because I prefer to write in red ink so I can differentiate between printed words and my notes easily. I suggest that you buy this inexpensive pen for yourself and your PDA owning friends! :)
2,"It twists, then it doesn't!","I bought this stylus/pen about 3 months ago and thought it a bit pricey, but very convenient. I don't care for the ""feel"" of the typical stylus - uncomfortable to hold and use for any length of time. I also kept finding myself at meetings where I needed a pen for notes or signatures as well as a stylus for my HP Jornada and this was the perfect answer, for awhile. ... plus shipping is a high price to pay for a three action pen that got firmly stuck on one point after 3 months of use. I pulled out my box to see if it was guaranteed, and it isn't. For me, it is rare to break a pen, I'm much more likely to lose them. I didn't do either to this one, one day, it just quit twisting -- I don't intend to repeat my mistake with another Platinum."
3,Ehhhh - SO SO,"I read all of the reviews before I purchased this pen. When I received the pen, I was suprised that it was actually the same pen that I read about. Yes, with a twist of the pen you can go from one tip style to another. Howerver, everytime I twist it, it feels like I'm going to break something. In short, the pen does everything that the description advertised, but the general feel is cheap. I and my co-workers can't believe that I was foolish enough to pay ... for this pen. I'll probably keep using it but I feel that this was not a good purchase."
2,Overall Disappointed.,"This combo pen is a 3-star product in appearance and functionality, but feels cheap. The weight of the pen is fine, but the mechanical function is not crisp. The pencil lead loading function is very difficult and slow. I am not planning on returning the pen, but would recommend against ordering it."
2,Disappointed,"I waited with great anticipation for the arrival of the pen but when it finally did arrive,was not as advertised. Only pen and stylus, no pencil! Would not recommend purchase as very similar already available, not as slim as expected - certainly cannot fit into my PDA's stylus slot and delivery very slow."
2,Should have believed the reviewers!,"This watch is very pretty, has the INDIGLO light that I love,and its band is not too small like some watch bands I have tried. However, other reviewers stated it is hard to read. They are right. I feel like I might as well look at the location of the sun to estimate what time it is. I'm going to have to buy a different watch. Wish I had saved my money."
3,"Nice watch, poor strap - had to replace","I really like the design and looks of this watch. However the black band is stiff and is rather difficult to fasten. Not only that, it puts the watch way off-center so that the buckle is not opposite the face of the watch, but about 3/4 of the way around. Then the watch slips around and you can't read it because it is on the far side of your wrist. I finally replaced the band and like it very much now, but had to spend time and money on that."
5,Great patch,"Right size, great qaulity, and is described as it looks. It's a great patch I put it on my BDU and it looks great.!!!"
2,What happened to Luaka Bop ?,"Beleza Tropical, released 10 years ago, was the first release on David byrne's Luaka Bop label. It contained a perfect selection of Brasilian music and introduced thousands of people to the most wonderful music of South America. Now, ten years later, we've got Beleza 2. In stead of a new surprise with every song, we get a carefully selected list of songs that sound commercially enough to make it sound good to anyone -but where's the excitement ? This album is plain boring, except for maybe 2 or 3 tracks... (Sergio Mendes' ""What is Love"" to name one). No Beleza 3, please..."
4,Exquisite music for a cold wintry gray day......,This symphony is hauntingly beautiful and slowly lures you into its reverent mood. Dawn Upshaw's vocal performance is like another instrument in the orchestra - so gently does its sound become heard. One can easily visualize monks during vespers - transporting you to a different time and place. I am enjoying this CD more each time I listen to it. A remarkable piece and perfect music to accompany the reading of a good book. I highly recommend it.
5,Magnificent Grief,"This piece is the most magnificent expression of human grief I have ever come across. I don't listen to it very often because there is no way to do so without tears. We live in a society that only values cheerful emotions so it is rare to come across any work that furthers our appreciation of the rich, deep, pure expression of sadness and pain in such an incredibly beautiful way. I am not skilled in opening and releasing my own sadness and this piece has become a valuable tool to me. It begins so quietly and builds so gently that I can actually feel suppressed emotion rising up out of me. As I said, I don't listen often, I always listen privately, and I am always moved. I highly recommend this cd."
4,"sad, sad music","I have only one complaint, and it might be a little nontraditional: the first movement of the symphony...I'd swear I've heard it in a war movie or the like...some sad scene on a battlefield strewn with soldiers' bodies and drifting smoke. For some reason, thinking this takes something away from the piece for me. Stupid, I know. But once you're past the first movement, it is stunning. And of course, w/o the Hollywood images rolling through my head, the first movement would be stunning as well."
5,AN EMOTIONALLY RICH PIECE OF WORK!,The first time I heard this moving symphony was in an art class. So soothing yet so haunting! Dawn Upshaw is incredible. Perhaps the most emotional piece of music I have ever listened to.
2,"The most popular, but not the best Gorecki 3rd","In this work the soloist needs to have complete command of the Polish language. Stefania Woytovicz's performance on Schwann/Koch (released as early as 1978 on LP and long before this million-seller) not only has that, but is simply heartbreaking, and Kamirski and the BRSO sensitively support her. The ascendancy of this Nonesuch recording says volumes about the power of publicity vs. true artistic merit. The Woytovicz disc is hard to find, but well worth the search."
5,The Nap Disk That Started It All,"Ahhhh Gorecki! Ahhh Upshaw! The musical marriage of these two talents provides us the first true napper's delight. This disc is rarely far away from the player in my listening room, ""The Womb,"" and has yet to provide a restful sleep. I think the furthest I've ever made it through the first movement was 4:12, and that was only because the phone rang around 2:16 and it took me almost a full two minutes to recover and be lulled away.Some nappers may be shocked at the rather short playing time of this disc, but in this day and age of programmable CD players, just hit ""repeat"" and sleep away the afternoon! Ahhhh! Bliss!Robert Lewis"
4,Michael delivers for fans of Jule Styne,Another winner from Michael Feinstein for fans of Jule Styne's music
2,"This project had the right idea, but lost out in the end","To do a project of Jule Styne songs must be the greatest idea, but what happens when you delute his beautiful songs with medley after medley....diaster. What a shame to ruin Jules' songs with such foolishness. I have never been a big fan of medleys.The good news about this project is that Jule played piano real well. Also Michaels' voice sounded good. I would have preferred a project where there were a lot of indidiual songs being performed. I'm sure my opinion matters, but i'm unhappy about how this project turned out. I feel like, I the fan somehow got short changed. Should my voice matter to Michael and his people.Recommendation: I Can Not Recommend This Cd"
3,Nice,"Cute leather shoe. Great for winter, but may be too hot for the summer. Insole very warm and fuzzy. Shoe runs small."
2,Runs at least 1 and 1/2 sizes small,"So sad! I'm barely a 9 and should have ordered a 10. At least. But they fit my friend who wears a 7.5 perfectly, so no harm done."
4,Stains easily,These shoes are very comfy and warm but I have two complains:1) they run small. I usually wear a 4.5 - 5.5. I ordered 6 and they just fit.2) These shoes stain EASILY! I spilled some plain old water as I was doing dishes and it stained the shoes. Cost me $20 to have them re-stained by a shoe cobbler. Make sure you spray them with water repellent first. I did that after they were re-stained and now they're ok but I learned the pricey way.
4,L - in a nutshell...,"Well, I saw moe. for the fifth time on this weekend and went out and decided to see how the live album was. I'm not too big on albums as I like to listen to live tapings of moe. but I figured I should give this a spin. Its a great selection of songs and it sounds quite good, thanks to the talent of the band's soundman, Steve, and the producer of the album John Siket (who also produced the soon to be released Phish album Farmhouse). My only complaint about this double-live cd is the compression. Its normal for albums that are commercially to released to have the sound compressed, unfortunatly I feel this has 'altered' the way the band sounds live to an extent, which is why I only gave the cd 4/5 stars. In conclusion, I do beleive this is a good cd and do not feel gypped out of my money, but if you haven't seen moe. live for yourself yet, make sure you are there the next time."
5,FREAKING AWESOME!!!!,"My roomate one day told me to put in the second disc on track 3. Since then I am a die hard moe fan. I am a big phish phan too, but these guys take it to the next level. They rock out so hard! I feel good rock songs need to progress or go somewhere, and thats what moe does. They take you to a new level of musical apreciation.Their music is so awesome. The sound of it will make any day a great one. I listen to it on the way to class because it puts me in such a good mood. And the jams!!!! I can hardly control myself when im driving a car listening to this stuff.Sure some songs are better than others, but these discs are gold. If you ever want some [great] music for chilling or whatever, this is it. Sure Meat was the first song i listened to, but wow is there some good stuff here. If you ever get the chance to just sit down and listen without any distractions, Timmy Tucker into Recreational Chemistry is truely epic.Buy this cd. You will not regret it."
4,Almost like youre there,"I love moe., I really like this cd because it reminds me of the shows ive been to i like the way spine goes right into buster, and also the high energy like three minute intro into st augustine (which is only sometimes annoying). A good version of most of the songs, but you can tell that all the tracks werent from the same show"
5,Double Pleasure,"Back in the summer of 2000, while hitting some Phish shows, I kept seeing people all around wearing ""moe."" shirts so, naturally, I had to investigate. This was the album I picked up at the store and brought home. My life has never been the same. There was a form inside and I immediately ordered everything on the list. As with all jam-bands, their finest work is outside the studio but they still delivered.Now, 10 years --and many moe. shows attended, CDs bought, and shows downloaded-- later, I am reviewing this album since it has been quite some time. it sounds just as fresh as the day I heard it for the first time and reminds me once more of why I will never miss a moe. concert within a reasonable distance as well as why I have reserved my Labor Day weekend for the moe.down festivals as long as they are held.This is about a great introduction to the band as there can be and any ""moe.ron"" who doesn't have this in their collection is a moron."
1,Not helpful,"I was expecting this book to provide me with the basics for properly grooming my horse, but most of the book was on how to braid and fix manes and tails, I was very disappointed, as I have read another of the Cherry Hill books (the one on horsekeeping on small acreage) and it was very basic and informative"
3,Limited.,This book is good for folks who have a basic knowledge of horses but want a little further advice. People who haven't had lessons or are just starting to work with horses for the most part will get confused easily. I got this book for a friend and while there is plenty of useful information tha main things we were looking for were hoof care. The most useful information I found was the section on tying the horse and approaching the horse. This book is helpful but definately not a complete source. We actually got Horses for Dummies and THAT book had ALOT of helpful information... including information on what you should consider BEFORE you become a horse owner.
3,Hard to find a good grooming book,"I bought this book because I thought it would be just as good as another in this series ""Getting the most from Riding Lessons"". I was really looking for specifics on grooming with highly detailed photos and step by step highly detailed instructions and tips. This book has some of this.There's a good section on catching, tying, and handling the horse. There is some basic safety information omitted.The hoof care is completely lacking. There is only information on how to lift and support your horses feet. This should be a VERY detailed section of the book considering how important it is to a horse.Daily grooming info is only OK.Washing section is acceptable to good.Clipping section is good but doesnt cover special clipping patterns.Mane and tail care and braiding is good.No leg wrap information is included.No transport of horse information is included.This all said - it's really hard to find a great grooming book."
4,A Great Step by Step Guide,This book really is for beginners but a great book to have. I am 15 years old and it taught me alot about horse handling. My favorite part of the book was about what kind of tack to use. It gave basic knowledge about horses which was very useful.
1,Waste of Money,"I condsider myself a beginner. This book is very simplistic.I learned most of these things in the first month of taking lessons. If you have a minimal amount of knowledge, this book would be a waste. Don't waste your time or money. I wish I hadn't."
4,Franklin Merriam-Webster Electronic Dictionary MWD 1490,"Easy to use and fast, but I wish the screen was was black on white and of higher resolution instead of the more difficult to read blue on green."
2,very poor at many things,"Pro:Cheap,Con:When turn it on, it doesn't automatic enter to the dictionary. You have to selected dictionary, so you're wasting time. New words in English language seem not there. The front size is very small to read, and visibility is poor. You will need an eye 20/20 to use it. As far translation is concerned 40% of the time that thing can't."
2,Franklin MWD-1490,"This electronic dictonary has no lighted display and it is very hard to read even in the day time. Of course in the night it is unable to read the display. May be the dictornary is fine but unable to read it, what is the useJJ"
4,its great for this price,The dictionary is pretty good. I have gifted it to my brother. it works good and he is well satisfied. it does not pronounce the word but for this price it is worthed.
4,"Merriam-webster Dictionary, Thesaurus and Reference Suite","It does not have the ""Bookman III expansion card slot, USB connectivity"" as stated. However,for the money it's a best buy."
3,an O.K product,"so this Merriam-webster?Dictionary, Thesaurus and reference suite, I know it's not college levelled product, but it has fewer vocabularies then I expected. also, it sometimes turns off suddenly when I pressed the key ""enter"" so i think its electric circuit isn't well designed. other than that, the product is satisfactory"
2,"Display broke, no repair or exchange options","I bought this back in 2008 when I needed a small, portable dictionary/thesaurus while traveling. It worked reasonably well for the price but I have a few complaints:- Entries are somewhat limited. It has no listings for about a 1/3 of the words I look up.- No auto-fill while typing a query, you have to type the entire word before finding out if it's listed or not.- Display broke relatively soon after purchase, no repair options.This last point upsets me most. A whole row of the display went out, making it unusable. Called Franklin but because I bought it thru Amazon they said ""sorry, warranty is up, nothing we can do"". No repair options, no exchange/upgrade offers, no recycling, zilch. Granted, I got a year and a half of use out of it but now it's just another chunk of electronic debris."
2,good luck replacing battery,"couldn't figure out how to get old batteries out,went to company website, was advised to ""just bring it to radio shack"" for battery replacement....radio shack for a battery replacement?? ridiculous.last franklin product i own."
3,Lacking Vocabulary,I have not used all the features nor have I used it a lot in any capacity. I do know that it has a limited vocabulary. 20-30% of the words I have searched are not included. The features that I have used are very intuitive.
3,Good reference,"Like it, but wish it had a back light for I read a lot with a reading light in the dark, so it makes it tough to read the screen in poor light. Has good amount of words, but not special terms and not as wide range as say, Oxford dictionary. I was confused, because it listed Russian language as one of the languages in the package, but it is NOT there. So I am using it just as a reference, not translator. Has a few cute word games, that might help building up your vocabulary and quick thinking. Overall - good for the price, but needs better description of the features."
3,okay dictionary,"This is not as extensive as I would have liked. I was hoping it would replace my old beat up paper dictioary, but i guess old fashioned is better!"
4,Nice one but Interface not to handy,"I bought this for my cousion, and she like that product very much and happy with it.You can search all most every word but what i didn't like is the ""Screen"".The screen is not so good but its ok.Rest all is fine, games are also good."
4,awesome product,good product. I wish the quality be a little more durable than what it is right now. But it is still an awesome product. Will recommend it.
5,The Greatest Idea Since Sliced Bread and Butter,"These are the most functional, sleek looking things I have ever seen. The only comments I would make would be for the company to use better quality suction cups for the feet, they fall off regularly and the contact paper on the back of the cutting board to make it look marblized is shoddy. However, they are useful, clean, pretty and add space to a space constricted kitchen. They are GREAT!!!!!"
4,BURNER COVER CUTTING BOARD,"I've been looking for a replacement of a cutting board plexi glass WITH LARGE RUBBER FEET so it sits over 2 stove burners. It's also a great space saver. Looked thru all magazines via mail....found none. The one I now have I bought thru a magazine 3 or more yrs ago...it was made in Germany and no longer available. The ones I finally found, thru long hrs on internet, was in THE WHOLE ED CATALOGUE via Amazon. This catalogue has everything. The only thing I did not like about the boards was the WHITE UNDERCOATING. I'd have preferred no undercoating. Price was very good. Gave one to family member"
1,Not water resistant at all,"I am a big fan of Timex and will buy only watches with Indiglo. I found this one very hard to read, and the strap is too long for my wrist. But the biggest problem is that after five days it stopped running. Note that the Amazon product description says water resistant to 30 meters. I wore this watch in the shower one time -- I did not immerse it, merely got it wet a little. A lot of condensation built up on the inside of the face, and it stopped working about an hour later. Buyer beware. This watch is NOT water resistant."
1,The Worst Customer Service,"Do not buy this product. I called for a replacement bowl and lid and could not be helped whatsoever. I do not have a receipt as it was a gift one year ago. When they transferred me to the parts department, I could not even order the parts as they did not have them available. Back to customer service who answered my question of ""What would you do if you were me?"" She said ""throw it out and buy a new one""!!! Could you imagine!!! I will... but it WILL NOT be a HAIER."
4,"48 Hours, 300 Pages, One Life","I don't normally read contemporary fiction, but I went through Luke Salisbury's novel in one sitting and enjoyed every page of it. Its vivid characters -- Howard Gaye, the English actor who dresses like Jesus and behaves like Lothario; the sweetly enigmatic actress Lillian Gish; and Harry Harrison, the narrator, who tries out many roles in his life but who fears he's stuck playing a cuckold -- and rich, authentic period (1916) detail give Hollywood and Sunset its flavorsome charm. But it's Harry's pixilated, often misguided but ultimately successful quest for redemption that resonates with this reader: here's a guy who does just about everything wrong but comes out all right. There's hope for us all, I guess."
3,not bad,"I was drawn to this book by all the hype surrounding Rushdie's death sentence. The two main characters, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, are likeable and well developed. They are very human, too. I found I could sympathize with Gibreel's feelings of disillusionment concerning his religion. I often found the story a bit confusing and over my head, such as the beginning Ayesha's story or the naming of the Ellowen Deeowen book. But the general storyline isn't difficult to follow. A great book to read if you're brushing up on SAT vocabulary. I think the contraversy enshrouding ""Satanic Verses"" is a bit blown out of proportion; I enjoyed the book's unique insight into Islam."
3,The Satanic Verses,Difficulties with the language and the substance even though I know it is a classic about the attitudes of Islam and I have lived in the Middle East for several years.
5,"Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about","""Satanic Verses"" is probably the best novel of the last 25 years. It tackles many issues quite intelligently, like religion (as everybody knows), colonialism, fame, migration, adventure, and what life is all about. The opening scene is shocking (two men falling from a plane 30,000 feet in the air and growing angelic wings) and the ending is perhaps one of the saddest and most poignant passages ever written."
5,"Incredible, more Vonnegutian than Vonnegut!","I haven't read a book so intense in human emotions since Slaughterhouse V. The intelligent attitudes towards religion and the conflict of good and evil truly provoke a love/hate response from the reader. However, it doesn't present a truly one-sided view of Islam, so I can hardly imagine why it would deserve a death warrant.Quite a book of our times, and likely to be remembered as a classic."
3,Interesting,Salaman is a great writer but at times is seems as if he is showing off his descriptive English talents rather than really telling a clear story. You get lost in the complicated story here. Not an easy read. I bought it because I was interested in the reason why it has generated so much hate by muslims. I would recommend this book to whoever is an English creative writing afficionado. Still making my way through it.
1,A devastating blow to Islam,"Salman Rushdie does a great job of blindfolding people from understanding the true beauty of Islam. He continuously insults and criticizes the religion as well as the prophet. The book is written wonderfully in terms of literary concept, but the information is flawed. I advise that if you read this book do not take what is mentioned about Islam and face value, rather understand what Islam is and than make your own decisions, instead of believing what Rushdie says. The book is a blasphemy to everything Islam stands for."
1,Garbage for Idiots,What a piece of thrash this book is ! Most of Rushdie's supporters havent even read the book or understand it fully because of they lack an understanding of the hindi/urdu language in which Rushdie hides his blatant insults against Islam. The End.
1,THIS BOOK IS AWFUL. IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN ULUSSES,"This book doesn't even try to make sense. I had to read the cliffnotes just to know what was supposed to be going on. There is no connection whatsoever to what Rushdie claims he wrote and what he actually did. I find the English lanuage to be wanting in terms to describe how awful this book is, so I suggest you go to your nearest bookstore, pick it up, read the impossible to comprehend first paragraph, skim it a bit so you have proof that it doesn't get any better, put it back, and then go wash your hands. To summarize this alleged novel in one word: PRETENTIOUS."
1,Too hard to understand.,"Maybe something was lost in the translation, but I could not understand why there was a hit put out on Salman. I read it twice so someone needs to explain it. Maybe to sell the book?"
4,Unexpectedly comical and enjoyable,"Unfortunately, this book's reputation precedes it. I came to it expecting a dry, deadly serious text on Islamic theology. In fact, the novel is a lighthearted delight. Rushdie is a master storyteller, punner, joker, and all-around wit. The renderings of Bombay street English are wonderful. The criticisms of Islam -- and they are not even so obvious as to be vulgar -- don't even come up all that often. On the one hand, Rushdie ensured himself a lifetime of fame and notoriety by having the Ayatollah's death warrant issued against him; on the other hand, perhaps the book's notoriety prevents people coming to it with a fresh mind, for an enjoyable, entertaining, thought-provoking read, which is exactly what it offers."
2,Not worth the controversy,"What's the big deal? This is a lousy book and not even worth the effort of a death threat. Obscurity is a far worthier fate for it. Yes, it's blasphemous to Islam but the sacrilege is in the context of the rantings of a mad man who's in the throes of a crisis of faith. So once you're over the shock, and once you note that most of the characters in it should be committed, the blasphemy''s pretty easy to dismiss. What's harder to ignore is that as a piece of literature, this is a hard to read and schizophrenically written book. What exactly is it saying? What's with the weird fantasy plot - two people falling off a plane and one turns into a devil and the other an angel - that meanders without any discernible purpose? It's funny in spots and brilliant in others but it's so uneven in quality and has very dull long stretches it's as if it really is written by someone insane. Um ... maybe it was."
5,It takes intelligence to truly understand,"A lot of people will read this and be sorry they did. I'm sorry that they don't have the intelligence to comprehend what is really being said. If for no other reason, buy the book to figure out why he recieved a bounty on his head for it."
4,"powerful, moving, slightly depressing","I finished reading this book for the second time in four years several months ago; it's impression has never left me since. There are so many complicated, tangled situations in this book, I'll only take a few of the most striking ones to examine here. First, the story of Mahund: very revealing, to me, of the history of the beginnings of Islam and the Koran. It's an odd, and perhaps foolheardy, not to mension ironic way in which to learn about this religion, but at least the bare bones of it have stood me in good stead. Next, the remarkable events surounding the pilgrimage of the village of butterflies: this was without a doubt the most powerful, and moving, section of the book for me. I could relate to almost all of the characters, sympathise with them, and feel all the emotions as they traveled, and experienced a miracle, one extremely to the Exodus parable. The only reason I awarded it 4 stars in the ending, more than a little depressing."
3,"solid, but far from his best","Having read a fair portion of Rushdie already, I came to the Satanic Verses with high expectations, but this book can't be placed alongside many of his other works. This is not to say that it is lacking in merit, but it certainly doesn't reach the heights he reaches elsewhere. In this respect, it compares to his more recent work Fury. If the ramifications hadn't been so serious, I would be inclined to dismiss the political dimensions of the work outright. More virulent charges against religion are commonplace."
3,Read with an open mind,"Many consider this book blasphemic, but despite my religious affiliation, I consider this a good piece of fiction. Rushdie's Anglo Indian paradox and words (phrases) might not be understood by readers in the Western hemisphere, but having Indian/Pakistani background, one can try to get the jest and intention of the writer. Before you discredit it, read the book for yourself with an open mind. Rushdie has a lot to offer."
4,The fatwa was personal,"Anyone amazed that this textually playful meta-novel earned the author a death sentence from the Ayatollah Khomeini need look no further than the first part of the segment entitled ""Ayesha"". It portrays an exiled Islamic cleric, the Imam, who surrounds himself with bodyguards to avoid seeing London (where he lives). Upon his return to his homeland, he metamorphoses into a man-eating monster. That this segment is a thinly veiled comment on Khomeini himself (who was exiled in London during the reign of the Shah) should be obvious to anyone. The (ultimately rather respectful) portrayal of the prophet Mohammed merely provided a useful cover for the Ayatollah's childish revenge on Rushdie for his satire."
3,Breathtakingly boring with an ambitious goal,"I finally decided to buy this book and read it. I am not much into religion and don't understand the fuss about this book. It is a breathtakingly boring book. I really don't think Mr.. Rushdie wanted to enlighten his fellow Moslems by this book, he must have had a much more ambitious goal in mind than that, I think he wanted to bore them all into a coma. I spend my money on this book, and it is nobodies fault but my own, I should have not been influenced by media frenzy."
3,Review of The Satanic Verses,We thoroughly enjoyed the book.It gave a good lesson in a subject of great interest.
1,There is a veil on the hearts and eyes of some.,"There is a veil on the hearts and eyes of some people, which stops them from seeing it correctly. They see an error in what they think is wrong and all errors of theirs subdued."
2,The shipment came late,"K, besides the late arrival, the whole book was written in terminology in which I had to read over and over again before I understood the meaning. Its not like the book came with appendices right? Anyway, I do not know whats the huu haa about the book. It seems pretty fictional. Coming from a Muslim."
1,Please stay away from this charlatan.,Salman Rushdie is a very well known quack and huckster from our age and time. It's quiet unfortunate that such pseudo intellectuals are able to garner so much attention and support among western masses.If you're genuinely interested in learning about Islam or Muslims then I'd recommend these books to you:1. Muhammad by Martin Lings2. A Short History of Islam by Al-Djazairi3. Sealed Nectar by Mubarakpuri4. Understanding Islam by Jerald Dirks5. Islam the Straight Path by John L. Esposito6. What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam by John L. Esposito7. Blood and Faith by Matthew Carr8. Jesus: Prophet of Islam by Ata ur-Rahim and Ahmad Thomson9. Myth of Muslim Barbarism and it's aims by S.E. Al-Djazairi
1,Overhyped and Boring!,"I happen to be very well versed in Islam and find the subject fascinating. This book however was a struggle to finish. Quite frankly, it is probably one of the most boring books I have ever read. Yes, there is flowery, pretty poetic language throughout the book. However, a lot of those pretty verses simply seem useless, distracting and often even nonsensical! I have no clue why this book got so many acclaims. If he had not been called out by overzealous muslim leaders, I doubt it would be well known at all."
1,What a waste of time,"I belong to a book club and this was chosen as our book of the month. I thought that it was just dreadful. After reading ""Midnight's Children,"" I couldn't believe a book of his could be so bad."
2,Sympathy for Rushdie,"I feel sorry for Salman Rushdie who will be remembered for this heap of junk. His word usage is unique but a more boring tirade I have never read. It is a shame the author has been so long tortured by a gang of religious fanatics who took this thing seriously. It took me years to get around to it after hearing all the fuss and I still do not know the source of the commotion. My sense of art has never been mainstream, but,Allah,please return the hours I have just wasted on this tripe. I can not even pretend to be on the band wagon."
1,Salman's word salad,This book makes absolutely no sense at all. Mostly rambling diatribe to fill pages and call it a novel. A waste of money.
4,An Amazing Tale,"""The Satanic Verses"" is the first novel of Salman Rushdie's that I have read and I have to say it is an amazing! Rushdie takes an unusual yet appealing approach in portraying the themes of good verses evil and metamorphosis. Rushdie left no rock unturned; never once did I find my self looking for more. However, at times the plot moved rather slowly, and I became lost in Rushdie's world of plots and subplots. There are times in the book when a character is having trouble distinguishing between reality and his dream world and I felt like I too was having the same troubles. However, these times are few and far apart and do not detract from the central meaning of the novel. The ending is truly captivating and make the bumps and stumbles along the path worth wild."
1,So far the worst book I ever read!,"This was my first and probably the last book I read of Rushdie. I got to be honest, I could not finnish it, I tryed 3 or 4 times. My mind simply closed of. First of all I found the story extremly boring and second af all I dislike his style very much, the way he goes back and forth in time! I do recomend people to read it though, because there seems to be very different ideas about it; people either love it or hate! For me, worst book I have ever read...and I have read a couple! Would give it 0 stars if I could! Arni"
1,Grow up!,"It is all very well to make a tand against Islam, if that was Rushdie's want, but over this book; its not worth it. I don't see how any religious leader could really have taken offence over such a puerile novel as this. The writing is amateurish, the premise is stupid and the attacks against the Islamic faith are contrived and ill-concieved.This novel is not worth the time, effort or controversy which is lavished upon it. I give this one star only because it is a required minimum it isn't even worth that."
1,"Over-rated, over long, over the top","This is a really very disappointing read. If it had not been for Rushdie's networking and the controversy he courted this book would gone out of print long ago. Too many critics were too afraid to say that emperor has no clothes, and praised this book, because of politics and not for reasons of literature. This book is nothing but second rate magic realism applied by a third rate mind- whose odepial conflict and self-loathing is given free rein, to produce a fourth rate text. It is stange that such a purile work is considered to be philosophical. His treatment of Islamic history is both bigoted and ignorant, his ideas regarding unbelief and faith never go beyond bar room bluster. Reading the book is like being trapped in an elevetor with Cliff from Cheers- but without the humour or humanity. Don't waste your money- the book is no longer chic and its expensive to serve as door-stop. Spare the trees that would die in vain for such a rant."
1,I'm sorry I read it.,"When I started reading the book, I thought something wonderful was going to happen. But, unfortunately, with no sense of humor,I read thousands of words written aimlesly. I would sentence this author to death to make sure he won't write aimless work again."
1,Not fit for a bonfire,There are few books which I have started but not finished but this is sadly one of them. The Muslims made a big mistake giving this the publicity they did. It should have been ignored. Do not waste time on Rushdie. He is not worth it. Sadly there is no option less than one star.
3,Book ia a mirror,"Any book is a mirror reflecting the state of the mind of its author, less so for scientific books and more so books of ""novels"". I found this book to be a reflection of the author's mind than to be an objective or enlightening work on religion. My assesment was to be proven right when Mr. Rushdie, in an interview offered his final solution to complicated world problems:"" people need to get together and make love to each other more."" hmmmmm, Could the current situation in DC be the result of impleminting "" Rushdie"" spiritualsim?"
4,You'll laugh a lot with this one,"Hello,I read other reviews (for the paperback format) and there were a lot of customer complaints about Mr. Rushdies's writing style for the novel. I agree that it takes some concentration to follow. So I advise future readers to take their time and absorb this funny, and emotional ( i thought that the end was tearful) story.You will often find yourself reading a hilarious and often ridiculous paragraph and then come to a part that will truly make you think about life.Now the book does have quite a bit of religious references that went over my head as I'm not familiar with them, so I took in some of the stories in an obvious and superficial fashion. Ultimately I enjoyed this book and encourage others to read it too."
5,More applause for Salman,An exciting trip through real and visionary worlds--with enough characters and scene changes to keep you challenged. Rushdie's sly sense of humor allows him to poke fun at his world with biting clarity. Part nonsense with a mock-serious facade--from the incredible opening sequences to the somber/comedic finale. Enjoy the dream.
4,Satanic Verses,Came on time but packaging broke down in transit and the book fell out. Probably the mail's fault!
3,Bewildering,"In my opinion, this was a supremely difficult novel to read. Although I appreciate the novel's central themes--loss of religion, loss of natioanl identity--I have little patience for the convoluted metaphors and imagery. It just took the pleasure out of reading and reminded me of the headache I got trying to read 'Foucault's Pendulum' (Umberto Eco). The first part of the novel was the most interesting, introducing the characters, but their visions after the fall to earth are just too bizarre and bewildering, lacking a story line or point of focus. Maybe I'm just a stupid American, but I think reading should be enjoyable, and this novel simply wasn't."
2,Over-hyped because of the controversy.,"This book's high sales are solely due to the controversy it created. Rushdie has written far better books such as Shame and Midnight's Children. Although Rushdie is famous for his abrupt shifts in scene he seems to lose the thread of the story himself in the middle. His chatty style can also get irritating. The few lucid parts are engrossing, however. Not worth the effort, though."
2,A Difficult Read,"This is not a book for the faint of heart. It is a difficult book to read. The allusions to the Qu'uran are clear. While the Muslim extremists took umbrage, there wasn't any religious put down that the majority of readers would find offensive. Readers will ultimately wonder if the book sold because it's a really good book or if the fatwah against Rushdie made readers want to find out what might have made the Ayatollah declare a death threat."
3,"Infamous book, difficult novel","The Satanic Verses is a rich, provocative but disjointed novel that never delivers as cohesive work of writing. As I'm a huge fan of Rushdie I found this book disappointing as a novel compared to any of his others. Nevertheless the book is enthralling in its own way through its complex metaphor and characterisations. For my part i found this book the most difficult of his to read and was only propelled to finish by its infamy. Not being well versed in the Quoran i clearly missed out on significant undercurrents which might sweep others along far more easily. Basic questions of the nature of prophets and God's word were easily grasped and hence the book felt overworked without a deeper knowledge of Islam. I do feel however that some elements of the book will last with me for my lifetime and on that basis it's hard discount."
2,A Rushdie Fan but this was a waste of my money and time.,"I read ""Shalimar the Clown"" and was smittem with the beauty of Salman Rushdie's writing. When the Joseph Anton Biography was released I enjoyed learning more about Slaman life. After reading all the difficulty that the Satanic Verses had caused so many people I decided to go ahead and pay the steep price charged for my Kindle copy of Satanic Verses. Well I really tried and tried but after about a third of book I decided to quit beating myself up by trying to continue a book that was offering me nothing but stress."
3,"Heavy with intentions, light on conclusions","The parallel plots of this book offer millions of potential epiphany deliveries.The dream sequences imitating the main characters' spiritual journeys could have had profound conclusions.What kind of idea are you? This is the theme of he book. I loved the question.The idea of this book was fantastic. The final plot conclusion was disappointing and did not convey what I feel Rushdie set out to do. His ""secularized religion"" of English class struggles versus the rationalization of mystic Indian culture, the whole time comparing these struggles with the origins of Islam with mentions of Christianity, judaism and buddism were lofty, but failed to meet my expectations in the end.His character development and writing style are wiorth mentioning as some of the best. I would read him again."
4,a complex story with ingested criticism,"The author is an expert when providing criticism that is interwoven into his narrative. I was drawn to this book bcause I read his short stories and because of the criticism by certain religious groups. What I find most interesting is that this book is not easy to read and the remarks he makes are not blatant. More than anything, you can easily find yourself bored at times when reading this book. No author in the world should be able to trigger any group this literally. ---Get something else to do. Go to a movie. Get laid. There is nothing here that couldnt be discounted the same way as changing the channel on the TV."
2,A very boring book,"I could not figure why the author had a jihad on his head, but then, I could not read beyond half the book. May be it is a funny or meaningful book for Indians as there are many references to their religion."
1,ummm....can you say overrated ???,"thought i would check this book out after having heard for years how amazing and clever it is.it is rare for me to completely abandon a book mid-way through, but it became unbearable.i think this book would've ended up in the scrap heap of whatever publisher put this out originally if khomeni had not made such a big deal about it.rushdie's writing style is annoying and non-sensical. the pretentious reader may find the prose enjoyable, if only to impress others in their social circle.maybe there are deeper meanings and references for indian and/or muslim people. but since i am neither, i really didn't care.if you find it provocative, you may want to shock yourself into numbness by watching south park.overall, not impressed."
1,Sorry as there is no less than one star,I was really astonished by its vague ideas and poor construction. really I could not understand its great fame. I am sorry for the time and money wasted for this story.
4,An Interesting Read.,"Interesting read about self-identity, integration, prejudices..etc. in Western society, human faults/tendencies, love, faith, power, sucess..etc. from an Indian point of view. I gave it 4 stars because, although entertaining, especially the second half of the book, I find the author's writing style a little tedious at times, especially during the first half of the book and perhaps a tad haphazard. Also, it's not a book I could say I would pick up years down the road to read again."
2,Big Hype,"This book is not as good it could've been. Rushdie has talent but there were two major stories that could've been (Gibreel and Salahuddin) and should've been two different, shorter novels. It would've been a different story, obviously, but it would've been a better one.The book was too long, too wordy, heavy on description and history of characters for it's own sake. Almost 500 pages into it and then SOMETHING starts to happen and even then, it's three heavy chapters of further explanation of two events that aren't necessarily spectacular.I did not like the book and felt that i put way too much into trying to understand a book that leaves the reader, as MANY reviewers noted, ""disoriented"". The first ten pages are hard to get into. I was about to drop it but i decided to finish and i did. It's not the worst book I have read but it's disappointing because you have a talented writer, an interesting idea for a story but poor execution."
5,A pleasure,"This is the only book I've read that I enjoyed just for the beauty of the language. I certainly did not understand all the allusions in the book, but Rushdie writes so wonderfully and paints such wonderful images that it was a joy to read. I did read just a little bit online about just what the ""Satanic Verses"" are, which was helpful. But I would recommend reading this book without trying to figure it all out. Maybe I'll go back and read it again someday, trying to understand it at a different level."
2,"Not Indian, Not Muslim, Not British Educated","For me, this book was interesting and very different, but I can't say I enjoyed it. Not being a British educated Indian Muslim, much of the context was beyond my reach. Why was there so much fuss over this book? My curiosity drove me to read it, but reading it didn't answer the question. Imagine being an Arab Muslim reading the Da Vinci Code and trying to understand the fuss over that book. If you liked Joyce's Ulysses and have time to devote to the unusual, you may enjoy Satanic Verses. But, if you don't like it after the first 100 pages or so, you might as well quit. Other reviewers have covered the basic plot, so I won't duplicate their effort."
1,Borrow it from the library,"If you would like to read this book, don't support Rushdie by purchasing his book; just borrow it from the library. Better yet, skip his mind games and go straight to the primary source, the Holy Qur'an, and find out the truth for yourself."
4,Dated but encyclopedic,"I have the comprehensive hardback edition & use it mainly as a reference & always find tips you don't usually get elsewhere (ex. using the crook of the elbow to steady a pistol, how best to peer around cover & concealment - different but too many use them interchaneably - among others). If you can get past the 1950's photos, you can find useful tidbits. The late Col. Applegate was a pioneer who blazed a trail few had bothered to document before. Styers's ""Cold Steel"" is in the same vein."
1,Needs an editor,"""The Secret"" to a great golf swing is still not apparent after reading this book. It's likely that Mike Cortson could teach you this secret if you took a private lesson from him, but that information is just not clearly presented here. He writes as if he's giving you a lesson face-to-face, bad grammar and all.To replicate one of his shot diagrams, take a bunch of triangles and arrows, apply random titles on top of them, and past them onto a page. That's it.This book needs an editor and a real illustrator pronto.I wish I could give 0 out of 5 stars to offset the unusual string of 5 star reviews."
5,An informed and highly portable pocket guide to the most effective way to address and execute hitting the ball,"The Secret To A Great Golf Swing by past PGA tour player manager Mike Cortson is an informed and highly portable pocket guide (just keep it in your golf bag while on the golf course for instant refreshing and reminders) to the most effective way to address and execute hitting the ball. Introducing a comprehensive understanding of the secret swing and thumb and hand placement, The Secret To A Great Golf Swing deftly guides aspiring golfers through step-by-step pictures and detailed descriptions including form for their shoulders, knees, arms, stance, etc. for the most practical and game improving approach to golfing. For improving golfing performance, The Secret To A Great Golf Swing is very strongly recommended for all novice golfers searching ."
5,Learn Ben Hogan's hand formation,"The picture on the cover can tell you much of what you need to know about Ben Hogan's unique hand formation at impact. ""The Secret"" is truely what Ben Hogan was actually doing at impact. Read it and be inspired to hit the ball better than you ever could under conventional teaching methods."
1,Nothing New Here,"Not recommended. There is nothing new in this slim volume. I gave the author the benefit of the doubt, but I was wrong. You won't find any secrets here that will improve your game unless you have never taken a golf lesson or never read another golf book."
1,Don't buy this book,I downloaded this book on my Kindle and it wasn't worth the 5 dollars or hour of my time I spent reading it. The author continually extols the virtues of using your natural arm swing to swing a golf club without describing how to actually perform the swing. To summarize the book...rotate the left arm counterclockwise on the takeaway and use your natural arm swing to deliver the club to the back of the ball. What? What the heck is the natural arm swing? Apparently all I have to do is swing the club the same way I walk because that is the only explanation.Apparently this guy was a lawyer too. I wouldn't want to proof read his affidavits unless you prefer reviewing nonsensical rambling.This was a complete waste of time and money. I have read 40 or so golf instruction books and have disliked some but none more than this. I implore you to not buy this book.
1,Review for J.A. Fridy's textbook,"The one star rating I gave the text might be too generous. I find that having poor examples, problems with no answers to check, numerous grammar errors, unclear ideas, and the list goes on, has made the class a poor learning experience for myself. I believe that it is not for an introductory class. Too much is assumed to be known by the reader. The class has been a real struggle."
2,Warning about the book,"I used this book for two analysis courses (Analysis 1 and Analysis 2) as an undergraduate student. It wasn't a bad book persay, it is confusing at times. The real problem with this book was how many errors there were in it. The professor of the class had to give us a copy of the errata (which was quite long), but the errors were spread out over the whole book and when you are reading or working on something and you don't understand what you are misunderstanding or doing wrong as an undergraduate student you think it is you, not the book. You have to continually check the errata to see if you are not understanding the material or if the there are typos, incorrect wordings, etc."
3,"Not that bad, but you can get other books.","Not a good self-study book. However, after one-year in Advanced Calculus, I found this one is not that bad. It mentioned enough stuff for further reference. If you must use this book, keep it. If you don't, I must say there are many better choices."
1,images mistake,"there is a mistake, because the image shows a Ring from screw to knife cameras;the code is B00021ETDOthat's because I bought the ring;if you look the image, you can see a knife mount design (for knife cameras);if you look the code B00021ET7K, you can see the same image, a ring for use screw lenses with knife bodies; that is what I was needing;I will buy the item with the correct code; would be nice to review the images"
3,Works for me in my yoga practice!,"I have been looking for some kind of relaxation music for my yoga practice. I do have a collection of New Age music, but they may not necessarily suitable for yoga exercise. I tried this one, and I should say that even though it may not be great music, but it does work well for my yoga practice. It helps me to calm down, get my movement and breathing into a rhythm. For this reason I should say it does work for me."
1,I was startled to hear this CD,"This music reminds me of a folk festival and I would have been better off with Peter, Paul and Mary. This music didn't even closely remind me of meditation or anything to do with Yoga. Half way through listening to this CD it was shut off and headed for the used CD bin at my local music store."
1,Folk music from the 60s,This CD has little to do with meditative yoga and sounds like a recorded love-in at the park with a group of non-professional musicians. If I could rate this minus 2 stars I would
4,Eddie Agonistes,"Here was a man who loved what he did. He could have been the fellow from ""The Loved One"" who delighted in his job at the pet cemetary; he could have been the gardner who loved the blossoms; he may even have been a Louisiana governer grinning over his goats before the FBI called. Ed was enamored of the movies' esthetic arts. And I am enamored of the the Bardot of fifty years ago--neither has a grasp on the way things actually are. In this set we find four of Ed's meisterwerk's: ""Glen or Glenda"" (I always thought the devil would be better dressed), ""Jailbait"" (the youngest member of the cast may be Lyle Talbot--I suspect false advertising), ""Bride of the Monster"" (c'mon--Loretta King resisted all liquids--why should we believe we should be killed by a sea creature?), and ""Plan 9"" (the aply named Dudley Manlove's line ""All you of earth are idiots"" suddenly seems a truism). I cannot recommend this set for nitpickers or other such maniacs, but for those who crave a laugh: buy it."
2,Post-Cult,"Plan 9, like all Ed Wood films, has become too well known to properly be considered cult. This was someone who sincerely tried to make films without any budget whatsoever. The fact that these even made it into theatres was an accomplishment.While Plan 9 is often considered the worst film, it isn't as bad is most make it out to be. One can watch this film from beginning to end without the urge to throw one's television out the window (try that with Howard The Duck). Granted he didn't produce much quality in his work, but had he been given a real budget who knows what he could have produced."
2,Plan 9 from Outer Limits (of Watch-Ability),"Just a quick note on Ed Wood. Someone said watching his movies is like that bad tv show you are suddenly watching, then find yourself changing the channel just to get away from it.I rented ""Plan 9"", and I can stand just about any entertainment experience, but I kept falling asleep. I suggest you rent it first - then decide to buy or not.Watching the movie ""Ed Wood"" is the reason I am even remotely considering this DVD collection (where else you gonna find a copy of ""Glen or Glenda""? If you really want an enjoyable movie rent or buy Ed Wood starring Johnny Depp with Sarah Jessica Parker. It is a drama that gives you insight into all of his movies and is a heck of a lot more entertaining - ""Ed Wood"" is the one to buy!Perhaps they should rename the box set, ""Train Wreck: It's so horrible to see - but you can't turn away (no-doze included for a limited time)"""
1,come on,"you've turned on the tv before and seen the most horrible movie playing and within 3 minutes the channel was changed. right?ed wood's movies are exactly the same. somehow their reputation exceeds them, but they are just boring and awful messes. there's nothing funny or exciting about them. it's like watching someone else's home movies. please.."
1,One Bad Track!,"If you, like me, are looking for a clean original recording of ""Don't let the Stars"", then you, like me, will have to find another source! There are thirty songs on this disc, and only a few of them are really poor quality. Most sound fresh and clean, but the master used for ""Don't let the Stars"" sounds like a 78 someone took out of the trash can! Considering this was his only hit, you'd think the producers would have made a better effort to find a ""mint"" condition (as it says on the back tray label) recording to use as a master."
1,meh...,"Compared to ""Holiday man"" I didn't like this album.But I didn't give it too much of a chance before I sold my cd collection..."
2,"Outta patience, is more like it","With great anticipation, I purchased Outta My Way. I absolutly loved Holiday Man. The wide variety of styles of music, coupled with interesting uses of vocal distortion, made HM one of my favorites.Same cannot be said about OMW. I've read some other reviews, most complain of a lack of artistic evolution with this band. MY problem was that they seem to have devolved. HM was playful, and inventive. OMW is juvenille, and a monotonous.I hope that this band eventually releases another album, one day. I just hope they do a better job."
2,WHAT HAPPEND!!!,"Oh my god! I have the Disturbing Behavior soundtrack and I see their song ""Got you(where I want you)"" and it totally rocked. Then I go into amazon to look up their cd, hoping it would rock just like the song did. So i listen to the samples and I wasnt feelin any of the songs. I felt ""GOT YOU"" and this cd sucked. DONT BUY THIS"
5,Rabbit Proof Fence,"Having lived in the Uk and Heard about the treatment of Aborigines in Australia I always felt deeply sad for another forgotton Race! Then I was lucky to move to Western Australia in 1991 and I relised that many people across the world have been prosecuted for who they are. As there is a possibilty of war against Iraq, woudn't it be nice if everyone forgot their colour, race, religion, or just their sad ""hangups"" And remembered that we all have a heart and we all breathe the same oxygen! Oh to have a peaceful world!!!!"
5,A must-see film,"I originally saw this film in our local theater and left singing its praises. I recommended Rabbit Proof Fence to every friend I have, and I think the DVD does a worthy job of bringing the film to the small screen.In addition to the film itself, the DVD has only a few special features. The most moving by far was the behind-the-scenes documentary. At one point, they show how filming the scenes of the girls being ripped away from their mothers affected the entire cast and crew. Clearly, this film didn't only touch its audience but everyone involved in making it.See the movie; buy the DVD. It's a must-have for anyone whose collection includes thoughtful, thought-provoking works."
4,you'll be awed by the strength of these kids,"This movie, based on a true story, tells the story of three half-caste aboriginal girls. After being forcibly removed from their families by the Australian government, for integration into white society, they run away and try to return home, along 1200 miles of a rabbit-proof fence.Their journey is heart-rending and amazing. And the epilogue, narrating what happened later in their lives, is even more stunning.A story that is simulataneously sad and awe-inspiring, it effectively brings this period of Australian history to life and demonstrate's the policy's effect on one family."
5,Heart Wrenching,"To describe this movie in a word, I would call it ""heartwrenching"". Why would the Australian government think that the Aborigines couldn't take care of themselves? What a sad movie. I have heard about the movie earlier, and when I finally got to see the movie, as a mother, it hurt me. But what a great scene in the end. To have met the actual young girls who went through it. Great movie"
5,An important story that needs to reach a large audience,"Watching movies like this is never easy. It is a period in Australian history that needs to be told and openly discussed. There are many books written on the ""Stolen Generation"" at the moment, and because people just don't read like they need to, the movie is an excellent source of information. It has hopefully opened the door to an issue that still needs addressing. The Australian government refuses to apologize for this ugly time in history. We can only hope that history never repeats.This is an excellent movie with an astonishing group of young aboriginal ""actors."" It is heart wrenching and, at times, difficult to understand how this can go on in a civilized society.As an Australian living in the U.S. for the past 13 years I would just like to say ""SORRY!"" In the truest, purest form of the word - Sorry!"
5,A Must See,"Our daughter had recommended this movie to us after watching it at school, and a special thanks goes to her. This movie captures the human spirit at its best actually using aborignal actors that had no acting experience proior to the making of this movie. Its a movie for all ages and teaches us a valuable lesson of human spirit, determination and the will to survive at such a young age, under such hostile conditions. This definetly a must see and to have in you're collection to be watched again."
3,its alright,"i didnt really buy this movie for the sake of entertainment. i bought it for a college assignment. the acting of this film is great but this is one of those films that you would watch on PBS and pretty much forget about it. i didnt like how the movie watered down the stolen generations era but it was based on a true story. if you are into these kind of films, than go ahead and buy it. but for me, it was something that i watch once and forget about."
3,Great film making,"This 98 minute film seems to be over in less than 60. Phillip Noyce does a wonderful job of capturingthe Australian desert country and gets superb performances from his three young 'stars'. It is not solely for the 'bleeding heart club' who of course will dote on it but seems to me to be an honest attempt at portraying cultural misunderstanding and the determination of the individual to choose what is meaningful for themselves. The aboriginal girls win this round in Noyce's account & the footage of the actual protagonists to end the film leave the impression that I believe Noyce wants to achieve.Before one scorns what appears to be the abyssmal ignorance of the white interlopers into Australian culture, the almost successful genocide perpertrated in the Americas should be thoroughly considered and digested. Tne mistakes made inAustralia were not based on greed and hatred but on an arrogance that is universal.This is an honest film which hopefully will linger and enlighten."
5,Great true story of the abuse of Aboriginies in Austraila,"Ok, its worth seeing but not worth owning at this price. So you may want to wait to buy. But the story is wondeful. If you didn't see it in the theater you will want to. In some ways its a hard story to watch. These people obviously mean well but they have no clue what they are doing the the families involved. What is totally disheartening is that this same sort of resettlement went on in the USA and Canada as well. Cultural imperialism. You will be rooting for the kids."
2,Rabbit Proof Fence movie review,"If this review were an 'American Idol' rating, Randy Jackson would say, ""Weeeeell, it was just alright for me dogg."" and Paula would say, ""It revealed an important era in world history, and I thought the acting was pretty good."" and Simon would say ""What an excruciating waste of my time."" . . . and I'd be in Simon's corner."
5,The Injustice of the White Race,"This story depicts the wickedness, I mean outright meaness of the white race. Be it blacks, coloured, chinese or even fellow whites, this wickedness have been told generation upon generation. I thought I had seen it all. It is unfathomable how wickedness could be perpetrated to such a degree and yet those committing these outrageous acts could sleep. I cried when this film ended and my wife had to comfort me.This is a story of courage and resourcefulness of 3 young girls, determined to live their aboriginal ways and not the ways of the white man. It is a story of racism, cruelty and injustice. But the story goes to show that the human spirit despite untold hardship will overcome any obstacles thrown its way. I believe there were many worse situations committed in times past and the stories have started emerging gradually. I commend and salute the writer Doris Pilkington (Garimara) for bringing the story to light."
3,3.5 Stars. Well done movie,"The story is a little too remote to identify with, but that doesn't really matter. You identify with the three girls instead of the story.The movie moves along quite slowly for the first half, and is pretty boring, but once you learn to connect with the plight of these three girls who want nothing more than to go home, this film affects you on an instinctual level.Excellent cinematography of the australian plains. The tearful eyes of the girls draw a paternal/maternal instinct from you that connects you personally with the girls. The rest of the movie doesn't really matter, it is all based on the emotion generated by the three girls' journey home.Watch this film at least once. It may seem boring, but it is ultimately a powerful film if you can connect with the lead characters."
2,Disappointing,"While this wasn't the worse film that I have ever seen it comes close. This had the potential to be a really awesome and dramatic story, but it turns out to be slightly more interesting than watching paint dry."
5,Rabbit-Proof Fence,"Based on a true story that marks an especially repugnant episode in Australian history, Noyce's visually arresting, powerfully moving ""Fence"" concerns efforts begun in the 1930s to recondition indigenous children of mixed heritage to be more ""white,"" through enforced training and the putatively superior discipline of civilized society. Sampi is marvelous as the scrappy and stoic eldest child, traipsing through the barren outback in tattered clothes and scavenging food with her clinging siblings while evading tracker Moodoo (David Gulpilil). Branagh is excellent, too, as the cold, noxious functionary obsessed with their capture. Don't hop this ""Fence."""
5,Rabbit-Proof Fence,"Great movie, my grandkids have seen this movie about 10 times, and I bought them this so they can enjoy it at their house. I hope to one day take them to Australia to see the actual place, this is what my grandkids want to do. Recommend to all a wonderful family film."
1,Poorly designed,"Not only can I not get this to work with my TV (I bought it because my old TV remote finally died), I can't even tell if anything's happening when I try to program it because of a lack of activity lights/indicators. As a rule, I like Sony products, but this one really stinks."
2,Semi-compatible,"I've not been happy with the service of this product. I do consider this partially my fault, as all the functions of the buttons are apparent through the display plastic (I purchased it off-the-shelf).This remote doesn't have 'skip' buttons, and was only partially comptaible with the Cyberhome system I purchased it for. Certain functions never worked (such as menu), and several functions worked differently each time I re-programed the remote.Still, it is a nice looking remote, and I might keep it in reserve for some other brand or item of equipment, should the need arise. If it proves to be more compatible with another brand, I might revise my review."
1,Lost Button Functions Over Time,"I bought this remote to use with my 27"" Panasonic CRT TV in the bedroom. The OEM remote lost button functions over time-just like the previous, more expensive Sony RM-VL900 I bought to replace it.The same thing has happened to this remote! I'm beginning to wonder if the TV is somehow the cause of this recurring problem. The main channel Up-Down buttons no longer work, so one cannot scan channels. The individual channel and PIP button still work, but only one of the PIP scan buttons function. The only way to surf is to bring up the PIP window, use the lone PIP scan button, then punch in each channel one wants to watch.I have a Universal MX500 for the main TV, and have had no problems whatsoever with it. Of course, it cost well over $100, and I just don't have that kind of $ nowadays. I'll just have to hope I can find an inexpensive remote that will maintain button function for more than a few months!"
1,Vendor shipping costs,"The delivery of the product was refused because the Vendor charged about $28.00 to send the remote which cost about $8.00 and could have be sent USPS for about $4.00!

4,Sony VCR? --- try 003 code,"If your Sony VCR doesn't respond to this remote, try entering the 003 code number (as listed for the Sony VHS TV/VCR/COMBO):On the Remote, press SET and POWER at the same time, and then press the VCR button. Enter 0 0 3 and press/release the ENT button.Missing/lost Operating Instructions? --- just download a free PDF copy from a search for RM-V202 on Google."
2,Argh!,"Bubble pad, under the keys, wears out, causing keys to stick or fail. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't."
2,Meh,"My biggest gripe with this remote is it's range... it's pathetic. I once owned a very old Sony remote that was so powerful, it could reach through walls. I even tried using it outside my house once and the freaking thing still worked! This one on the other hand can barely communicate with my tv in the same room. If someone is standing between the remote and the tv, it won't work. At first I thought it was weak batteries but that's not the case at all. Maybe my Sanyo tv has a weak reception or something. I doubt that's the problem.Also, like most reviewers here, I too have a problem with it not having an indicator light that tells me I'm pressing the keys correctly. It's a real pain.Still, I have had this remote for about 5 years now and it's still working which is great.In the end though, this remote is subpar at best. Get something else."
2,Doesn't Work with Dish Network 301 Receiver,"Dish Network uses a proprietary receiver and this remote has no code for that unit. The remote's 'code search' capability cannot find a code for it. Calls to Sony support were worthless; hard to believe Sony isn't familiar with Dish Network, one of the major satelite TV providers.Connects well to the TV, VCR and DVD player, but that does little good when it won't control the reception and channels.Be nice if they'd tell you it doesn't work with Dish Network BEFORE you order it."
1,Sony should recall this remote...,"First it has separate code sets for analog cable, sat receivers and digital cable. It defaults to analog cable, and who has an analog cable box... This is an extra step before you enter the code that is unnecessary.Secondly the code listing is far from incomplete, as I was able to search and find at least three codes that supported my Comcast Motorola box, but ther listed code did nothing. They all worked, except for pulling up info, which is absolutely necessary with 500 channels. The display button on the remote inconveniently did nothing.This gets returned now, so I can buy another remote to agonize me. This should be pulled from market, and superceded with a remote with good documentation, code list and simpler programming."
1,Stopped working after one year,"This is junk. Like the other reviewer who found the buttons stopped working, I did too. I opened it up and found it is has super cheap components that will fail with time through oxidation. Pay a bit more and get something that lasts."
4,"great product, a pain to find code","nice sleek design, affordable - worth the money, however it was my understanding that universal means one code for all/any type of tv. which it has been with other universal remotes. this one was a pain b/c theres a huge list of all the codes and they line up with a huge list of all the types of tvs, dvd players etc. bottom line it took like 30 min. for me to find the right one. however once found, its great, sturdy- i always drop remotes so they dont last that long with me but this one is holding up!"
3,works OK but could be better,We purchased this remote to replace our sony TV remote. The price was right (less than 10.00)and it functions OK but the buttons are raised so it is prone to inadvertent pushing and you cannot add or delete channels to surf.
1,It works with the Sony TV but ...,"It won't work with any device with a code higher than 099, so it won't accept the DVD player or the satellite dish receiver. If I had known this, I would not have bought it. This was one of those gotchas; the postage to return it is more than it is worth.It might have been state of the art 10 years ago, but it is useless now."
1,Not worth your time,"I bought this book at B&N thinking it looked like an interesting read. I finished it this past weekend. This is the first time I have read anything by this author. I really don't think the author had any clear ideas of where she was going with this story and any of it's characters. Everything is so shallow, repetitive and dull that after the first 100 pages I didn't even care what the outcome was. The only reason I finished it was because I paid good money for the darned thing!"
2,Preachy and boring,"Jane Haddam seems to have lost her sense of humor and perspective. This book was talky, preachy, boring and bleak. I realize that serials have to be kept interesting but taking all the fun out of them hardly seems the way. It was repetetive and most of the characters were detestable."
1,Dissapointed,"This was the worst book I've read in long time. I couldn't make it past page 75 and I am rarely able to stop a book without finishing it, in this case I couldn't make myself finish it. The characters were not only one-dimensional, but also unappealing. The plot moved incredibly slowly and the book was poorly written, I'm surprised that it made it past the editors as is. If you want to read this book I recommend that you take it out of the library."
2,Not helpful,"As a new AF wife I picked this up in hopes of gaining a better understanding of military life, expectations and jargon. It was completely unhelpful."
5,Wonderful Gershwin music!,This CD has a great collection of most of my favorites of Gershwin's pieces! The quality of sound is great and the performances are powerful. I recommend this CD to everyone!
2,movie music,"This sounds like the music you hear during the old silent movies. Only the last cut, An American In Paris has a little more character. It is also the longest at 16 minutes.I wish I could have previewed tracks from this cd. I would not have purchased it. I do not mean to denigrate the music, since music is a very subjective thing. I don't know anything about piano rolls, I was just looking for some Gershwin music. My mistake."
2,Gershwin's playing overated,"After I heard this cd I bought Gershwin plays Gershwin on the naxos label which arn't piano rolls. Any pianist can tell that many of these rolls are heavily edited and can't be played by a pianists with two hands. On the naxos album that has some of these same songs Gershwin's actual playing doesn't sound very good. Many of Gershwins contempories such as James P. Johnson, Eubie Blake, Luckey Roberts and even Zez Confrey were much better pianists than he was, however they didn't have his melodic gifts as a composer. I would recommend Artis Whodhouse'stranscriptions of Jelly Roll Morton's piano rolls (on the same label) instead because most of those are exactly how he played them and in my opinion Morton was a better musician in every way than Gershwin."
2,It will break,"I really like the features of the calculator, but no matter how careful you are, the battery compartment door will break. I've had four of them, and the same exact thing happened to every one of them, without ever having been dropped or abused in any way. The plastic holding the battery compartment door has broken off and been laying on the desk without the caluclator even having been touched. When it breaks in this manner, the batteries loose contact and all data is lost. It's to bad an otherwise great product has to have a design flaw like this."
5,HP 19Bii Business Consultant Calculator Review,"The calculator is in PERFECT conditions, just like NEW.No problems, no scratches nor dents.Good to know that there are honest people doing business out there.Thank you,Luis H. Garza"
2,Fragile and too big,"I had first bought my HP19BII in 1993 when the PDA's didn't exist. The ability (short when compared to the newer PDA's) for archiving text, formulas and agenda were the most appealing features at that time. But I got frustrated...The HP19BII is so fragile when compared to the rugged and reliable HP12c that I do not recommend anyone to buy it. Everyone I know that has an HP19bII (or its scientific counterpart, the HP20) had the battery compartment broken. Thiscalculator has this incredible project flaw !If you are wanting to buy just a financial calculator, your choice should be the HP12c. If you are wanting more than a calculator, buy a PDA instead. By the way, I now only use an HP12c and my broken HP19bII is comdemned to get dust."
4,An Eye Opener,"After watching the movie, ""pretty dirty things"", I am left with more of an uappreciation of what immigrants go through to get into the United States. This movie did an amazing job of showing how far some will go to migrate into the U.S. for better job opportunities. It exposed the evils of money and greed within the management of a hotel, but also showed how far friends will go to help out one another. In the end, this movie did a good job of showing the underground world of illegal immigration. It has changed my own view of illegal immigrants and showed that all they want is a better life for themselves, which they will do anything to obtain."
4,Pretty terrific,"Absolutely required viewing for screenwriters. Best Inciting Incident ever. Nothing like finding a human heart clogging up your hotel toilet. Great acting, nice use of Others in society, and a taut thriller that is both inevitable and surprising. The structure is an exquisite time bomb that we dissected at UCLA."
4,Well worth the Viewing.,"I can watch this movie again and again.It is a very good representation of the other side of the Social Ladder. The extreme poor, Illegal Immigrants trying to make a life for themselves.This I would highly recommend to anyone to rent or buy."
3,Dirty Pretty Things,Shows how you can be taken advantage of as a desparate not legal citizen. Great foreign film.
4,Great Movie,This moive was great from begining to end the title should have been something different moive is not what the title suggests
4,A unique story from London's underground,"This film is about the lives of illegal aliens in London, United Kingdom, and their dreams, struggles and battle for survival.Illegal aliens live in every country and every city. They live under the radar without rights yet with tons of responsibilities. They are exploited, harassed, blackmailed and manipulated in the most inhuman ways when all they want to do is to provide for their families and to lead a happy life.In this film, we look at the story of two illegals trying to make a better life for themselves. The reasons with which they became illegal are different and so are their final destinations. But they have to work together to get out of London.The film is full of thrills, twists and a sad but very satisfying ending. I totally recommend it."
4,Understated desperation,"The lengths to which people would go for survival is examined in this well acted, grim thriller. An absolutely fine example of a film made with actors, who will be stars tomorrow."
3,African Londoners,"I was surprised by the contents of this film. I currently live in Djibouti, and have been studying the Somali language for a few months now. When Somali characters turned up in London as patients of the Nigerian sawbones, I was pleased to understand at least a little of what they were saying.The movie itself is fairly predictable and not very believable. It certainly was good entertainment for a boring afternoon in Africa, but I doubt I could interest many of my friends to watch it."
4,PLEASENT MOVIE,A SUBJECT THAT NOT ONLY IN UK BT MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES. I ENJOYED THE CHARACTORS AND THIER INTERATIONS
4,a darn good non-Hollywood film.,"Interesting thriller-drama that keeps you watching. Free of Hollywood slickness and doesn't rely on known actors. Well-acted, with subtle love tension between the two main characters that we can all relate to. Good scuzzy supporting cast. Not a great film, but one of the best films showing right now."
5,Very different type of thriller,"This is not your ordinary cops and robbers story. The protagonist Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is an illegal Nigerian immigrant in London who discovered a human heart blocking the toilet in the hotel where he works. He's a hard-working man who drives a taxi in the day and works in a hotel at night. He rents the couch of a Turkish girl, Senay (Audrey Tautou).He reports the heart to his boss, who refuses to report the incident and advises the man that the hotel business is about strangers who will always surprise them. ""It's our job to make everything pretty in the morning.""Okwe cannot speak to the police, but he cannot let the incident go either.""Dirty Pretty Things"" gives us a view of the seedier side of London. This is definitely a thinking person's mystery with a different and fascinating story. Kept me watching all the way through.Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
5,An original and affecting story,"While there are many dark subjects explored in this engrossing but deeply disturbing story, I found the film amazingly refreshing. It was a genuine pleasure to see complex and unusual characters, well developed and well acted, in a story about, to quote the lead character, ""the people you never see -- the people who drive your taxis, clean your rooms, and suck your [Amazon would censor this]."" The story was allowed to develop organically and didn't feel forced, in contrast to so many films that rely on choppy editing and awkward dialogue to advance the plot. And, while the film is not billed as a love story, the emotional attachment between the two lead characters is very affecting. The director, Stephen Frears, directed another of my favorites, ""High Fidelity,"" and I now intend to make sure I see everything he's done."
1,Grim,"""Dirty Pretty Things"" is a well-directed, well-produced and well-acted movie. It also is the most relentlessly grim film I've seen in a very long while. Even the relatively uplifting climax is short-lived, dropping the audience back into the overwhelming depression and hopelessness that characterizes the story. It's a bummer--don't see it if you yourself tend toward depression."
1,I wanted my money back.,"Trying to represent the plight of what other reviewers have called the ""gritty London underbelly,"" Frear's Dirty Pretty Things only utilizes the most melodramatic means to present the most stereotyped picture of immigrant life. The film's heart-wrenching story is wrought with the subtlety of a metaphoric hammer pounding meaning into your priveleged American soul (or of a heart found in a toilet! how avant garde!), while its MTVesque cinematography (red is anger! blue is sad!) is nearly as simplistic. The characters are unconvincing, Tatou's attempt at a Turkish accent is completely incomprehensible, and the central conflict is absolutely undefendable.As a whole, this film depicts immigrants in a overwhelmingly one-dimensional manner, becoming, by the end, an insult to the very people it is meant to ""represent"". To state that this realistic film on a powerful subject would be a gross, self-delusional lie."
3,Good film - a little too long,"I like Dirty Pretty Things and I loved the ending. The journey however gets just a little tedious after you hit the halfway mark. The point is clearly made early in the film about the treatment and living conditions of the illegal imigrants in London and then it is made again and again. Not in a club-you-over-the-head way, but not all of it warranted to propel the plot either. In fact, my real problem with this film it that it keeps breaking the tension that it builds. The perfomances are fine all around and the end is a winner. You kind of see it coming, but can't completely convince yourself that it will. At the payoff - you want to cheer because it does come around to that place you wanted and it works. A little overated, but good."
4,"If You Liked ""Amelie""...",Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou perform wonderfully together in this fantastic flick about imigrants in London and the black marketing of human organs. This movie portrayed a very real and serious situation in which immigrants are preyed upon by greedy and inhumane people. It is shockingly realistic and at the same time adds the silver lining of the cinema with a beautifully crafted story line and the dramatic portrayal of the main characters. Excellent!
3,pound test,"Product description is useless without the pound test.Pound test can vary widely, such as ""6 lbs "" to ""100 lbs ""."
3,Sound is Terrible!!!,"The video quality is great, the camera angles are interesting but the sound is terrible! there are times in which you even hear the echo. I believe part of it has to deal with the fact that the location in which the concert took place is not designed for concerts, so the accoustics are terrible. I also think they only used the ambient mics to record the concert instead of a nice 5 channel mix fed from all the other mics. It's sad.. I was expecting a booming powerful sound from the bagpipes and all I got was a noisy concert with lots of echo.If you're a fan of Corvus Corax is a must have. Because it is hard to actually see them performing live.."
2,Was not impressed,I just couldn't get into this DVD performance. Love the best of CD I got of theirs though.
5,Great but where is the complete 1930 version?,"This is ""Duck Soup"" as written four years earlier with a score by the Gershwins. How could that be bad? Reference also the Kurt Weill Paris/London score with a similar plot from 1931 (""The Cow Deal"" in English).One question: This is the 1927 score, with some songs from the complete revision (and dumbing down) that was a hit on Broadway in 1930. The notes say the complete 1930 version was recorded at the same time 'and will be released at a later time'. Well, it's 17 years later, how much later does it have to get? Nonesuch?"
3,lovely views,theis dvd is not bad. the starting sequence of the the film and the bird's eye view of the herd of caribou running was absolutley awesome. but the film feels abit slow and drags on abit about the life of the INuit. great but stick to landscape views. NOt as enthralling as I thought it would be but worth watching nonetheless.
2,"Nice photography, boring story",I expected a movie full of awesome camera shots and an interesting story. I thought this movie was rather boring and the photography was not particularly impressive.The film was well edited and produced and IMAX footage is always really great but I was expecting alot more. HD quality was great. I found the bonus features (making of the movie) much more interesting than the actual film.
3,Good if you guage the weather conditions,"We used the seeds across two years. The first year, we planted it in semi-shade and the seeds hardly took off (most of them died). This year we planted them it full sun and they seem to be doing fine.i have ordered several times from SeedsOfIndia and they seem to do a good job getting the seeds to me in time."
4,"Can something be great, yet mixed?","I was up in the mountains of New Hampshire when I read this collection of short stories so I found the New England settings of these stories just about perfect. The writing is thoroughly enjoyable. Andres Dubus III knows how to turn a phrase and describe a scene with the best of them. The reason that I gave this collection 4 stars was the fact that many of the ending disappointed me. The endings made the stories disappear. Dubus III has a style that really locks you in to the characters. Many of the main characters are problem individuals who you end up viewing with or reading with empathy. When some of the endings fall off the cliff, so to speak you end up feeling cheated for developing this empathy. Other than that the stories are creative and fantastic in the ways of Carver, Chekhov and Johnson."
4,For Anglo-Saxon language students.,"This is an exact word for word translation of the original Anglo-Saxon Old English. It's a facing page translation (Old English on the left and New English on the right). This is a good translation if you are studying the Old English as a language. Because the grammar of Old English is much different from New English, it's not a good translation if you just want to read the Beowulf story like it was Lord of the Rings. If you just want a good read, try Seamus Heany's translation or Howell Chickering's translation. Both have good facing page versions, and it's fun to see the original Old English as you read the translation. Then, if you get into wanting to learn Old English, then buy John Porter's version."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus.The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.
4,Damages from Shipment,"It's well-priced and super easy to assemble so an ideal choice for home gym use. I read all the reviews and thought surely the company had re-thought the packaging by now since few really said anything negative about the product itself. Nope. Next call is to Schwinn to get 4 shattered plastic pieces re-sent and a new computer cable that was broken-none of these items keep it from working just fine. While the bike (just got it 2 days ago) will be great I'm sure, I can't help but wonder why 2 such reputable vendors (Schwinn and Amazon) wouldn't take these concerns more seriously."
4,A Great Deal,"If you are looking for an inexpensive yet well made basic exercise bike, I highly recommend this. As other reviewers have noted, for whatever reason I received the box in poor condition, including multiple large holes, yet ultimately the only problem turned out to be a single missing bolt, which I bought for $1 at the local bike shop. I put the bike together by myself in about half an hour, and it fits snugly into my living room. Very sleek, and it's a Schwinn, which has a great reputation. I have been using the bike for about a month and have had no problems with it. The seat is relatively comfortable, computer works fine, etc. Oh, and the most important thing: this is a steal compared to the sticker price; you really can't find this bike for under $300 anywhere but Amazon."
3,Product was inadequate......,"When I received the package the box looked fine, until I opened it.The bike had a big hole and it was cracked. I never had a complaint before about the products I received from Amazon.Schwinn Active 10 Series Upright Exercise BikeThe bike was inexpensive but still, I didn't expect a broken bike."
1,Schwinn Customer,"One star is too high a rating, but I can't put in a zero. I received this bike in defective condition. After I assembled it, it would not crank at all-not one turn. Since it was supposedly under warranty I called the Schwinn Customer Service number. The representative wanted me to check the pedals and adjust the support bracket. The pedals turned freely and the bracket is welded in place-no adjustment possible. I insisted that the defect was internal and needed a trained technician to fix. The representative finally agreed to arrange for a technician to come to my house to fix it. Then she told me a technician would contact me within 5 days. There was no promise that the tech would come within 5 days or 5 months. This is no warranty at all in my opinion. I'm returning the bike through Amazon who was very helpful."
5,Consumer Report Rated it Well,"I've been a continuing subscriber to consumer reports, and when they recommend something and I buy it I have not been disappointed yet! This machine is not tooo bulky and soooo quiet, you literally need to strain your ears to hear it, which is nice since I'd been going to the gym for awhile and the bikes there are so loud. It did not take long to assemble. Important item: THe seat is very comfortable. It is highly adjustable. The computer has manual or programed sessions that will really make you sweat. The pedals are soooo smooth. Schwinn really knows how to make a good bike. I never bought from them before but if I consider an upgrade I'll go with them."
3,You get what you pay for apparently,"This is Schwinn's cheapest upright exercise bicycle. It was costly to ship and I should have bought it locally to save 80 bucks. The left crank arm was loose, so the thing was going clink clink on every down stroke of the left pedal. Only because I have a full complement of bicycle tools was I able to do the warranty repair myself. But the upside is my wife rides the thing for 1 to 1.5 hours a day and its still going strong 3 months later after that initial tweek. 3 stars for buying it from amazon and incurring shipping costs. 4 stars if you buy it locally and have bicycle tools..."
5,Does a great job in removing dust from the air,The air filter works so well that I actually need to change it too often. I live in a very urban setting with terrible air quality. This filter has helped greatly.
4,Very happy,Love product and would buy again. Good value for price. Noisy but I usually slept with a fan anyway. Could be smaller size
1,works ok but operating costs TOO high,Works as should EXCEPT the price of the replacement filters is RIDICULOUS! I can replace the filters in my home for 2 years at the suggested frequency as I can one time in this air filter. Might consider this Before purchase.Wish I did.
2,It didn/t seem to do the job,"Maybe I was expecting too much. But, I had a guy come into my working studio, (art studio), and when he sanded the spackle on the ceiling, the dust went everywhere. He didn't take the right precautions to contain the spackle dust, powder or whatever. Well, it when EVERYWHERE ! ! I couldn't go into my own studio without chocking on that ***%^##% dust, power. I had it cleaned several times, and when the contractor suggested that I get an AIR PURIFIER to clear the air, I did. Well, it DIDN'T !Anyway, perhaps a much larger unit would do it. I'll see."
5,Mamma Mia!,"I absolutely love this movie!!! The music is fantastic, the singing phenomenal (the girls mostly), and the acting incredible!!! Meryl Streep is absolutely at her finest (yet again) as Donna while up and comer Amanda Seyfried has the perfect mix of ballsy innocence and moxie as Sophie. The bonus features are fun (Karaoke anyone??) and the commentaries great. Blooper reel is funny and I could go on forever. A must have for your collection."
2,Mama Mia,"I did not like the movie; however, I lent it to my sister-in-law who loved it. I guess it is a matter taste."
3,Lovely Scenery,"I'll give this movie 3 stars for the lovely scenery & uplifting atmosphere. As for the singing, perhaps they should have had the members of Abba singing. Meryll Streep & Pierce Brosnan singing, god help us !"
1,Pretty boring and predictable,"I heard great things about this movie, especially Meryl Streep. Although her performance was good, the movie dragged. Not as exciting as the Broadway play. The biggest comic relief was Pierce Brosnan's attempt at singing.... and that wasn't supposed to be funny. Just awful!!"
1,Go See The Play,"The actors were too old. Meryl Streep is a great actress but, let's face it, she was way too old for the part as were the others, I saw the play and it was alot better than the movie, the actors ""fit"" thier part and could sing better."
1,Appalling sexist drivel,"As a woman, I found this movie unbearable and gave up after 45 minutes. Every female character is a vacuous giggling drama queen who should be on meds for bipolar disorder. To be fair, the men aren't much better. Surely the cast saw the script. Shame on the whole pack of them for sinking to this. I hope whoever holds the rights to Abba is suing."
1,This was a musical?,"I saw the stage version of this and it was a delight, so I thought I'd try the movie & like an idiot I even bought it! What a disappointment!!! It is ESSENTIAL that the actors in a musical can sing!! It should have made like some old musicals: The King & I and South Pacific, etc. dubbed those atrocious voices, then it would have again been a light, fun film with great ABBA music."
5,Good made better,"My video showed up promptly and I was so excited!! Then it stopped working, I was so disappointed :( I contacted the shipper, they sent me another one - that worked all the way through - and even a postage paid envelope to return the one that didn't work. Awesome!! Thanks!"
5,Mama Mia,Mama Mia - What a great movie. You can watch it over and over again like Pretty Woman and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Two of my favorites.
5,Great Fun!,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews on this film; there must be a lot of curmudgeons out there. First of all, most people who went to see Mamma Mia love ABBA and all their songs. Obviously no one can sing these songs even half as well as ABBA did, but so what? Bjorn and Benny's music is so wonderful it stands on its own no matter who sings it. This film is fun, the gorgeous Greek setting makes it pure eye candy, the songs no matter how ""imperfectly"" they were sung are still infectious and make you want to jump out of your seat and dance, and you will sing along with most of them. This movie does exceedingly well what it is supposed to do: entertain. As for the ABBA music, I probably wouldn't buy this soundtrack and rather, I would buy the original ABBA music if I wanted a CD of the songs on this film."
2,Disappointing,"Meryl Streep is pretty good. Pierce Brosnan is awful - he can't sing and shouldn't try. There is a kind of peculiar slant to this movie - all the strong roles go to women - the men are weak and have marginal roles. Most of the emotional and physical intimacy is between women with men shut out. If this is your cup of tea, you might like this movie."
1,Embarrassing,"I'm not sure how all of these top-notch actors were convinced into performing in this film, and so horribly. Even Meryl Streep couldn't save this disaster of a movie. It was overacted cheese, cheese, cheese from start to finish. I like Abba, I like musicals, I love most of the cast in other films, but the best word to describe the whole production is embarrassing. I blushed for Streep, Brosnan, and Firth, as they inexpertly belted tunes off-key with a melodramatic exaggeration I would expect to see from a child actor in a low budget Disney movie. Who gave this director money? Who edited this? What producer didn't put their foot down when they saw the end result, and stop this movie from ever hitting the theaters? This is definitely one of the worst five movies I have ever seen in my life. I should have watched High School Musical 3 instead. It was probably better."
1,Buy Abba's Greatest Hits instead!,"Acting (if you could call it acting!) horrible, the singing shrill and does not in the least compare to Abba, the screen play ridiculous.I can't understand serious actors like Meryl Streep and Colin Firth even accepting this disaster screenplay - what a MESS all around - simply ridiculous."
1,Awful,I love cheesy movies and a fair number of musicals BUT this has to be a joke. This movie is breaking records for 2008??? There are maybe two songs that faired an okay from me-the rest I was cringing every time the actors opened their mouths. I love Meryl and I doubt that I'll ever be able to prop her back on the pedestal I had her on after this. This is bad. This is a very bad film and I couldn't dare recommend this to my worst enemy.
3,Too much of a musical- in my opinion not a good thing,"Ok. I wanted to see this so bad that I purchased it. This far I have really enjoyed all movie musicals that I have seen but I found this one to be lack luster. The songs, besides two, were not really rhythmic and the coreography did not wow (once more in exception to two.) I also did not like that every five minutes they broke into song- there was very little acting and alot of it was mediocre, the acting, the musical numbers and the vocalization/songs themselves. It had some good laughs- the comedy was the only thing that kept it alive in my book, but still getting through this film was not easy for me. I rate it a three because of its two highly coreographed and rhythmic songs and its comedic parts, otherwise I would have rated it a two. I really don't think this film is worth more than [...] bucks."
2,"Definitely a ""chick flick""","Please keep in mind that this 2 star rating is from the perspective of a male. My wife & daughter would surely give this movie 5 stars. they loved the music, the dancing, the romance, the plot, the actors, everything. I, on the other hand, got the creeps watching Meryl Streep & Pierce Brosnan try to sing & dance. Their singing & dancing skills, along with most of the cast, were way below average. Other than the songs we all know (Waterloo, Mamma Mia, etc.) the rest of the songs were mediocre at best. The only actor worth watching was the daughter, played by Amanda Seyfried. She brings a lot of joy to her role and seems to be the only actor not just going through the motions.Guys, buy this for your wife & daughter and find something else to do while they watch!"
2,Pandering to Stereotypes,"My wife knew she was going to love Mamma Mia, and she did. I expected to have mixed reactions, because while I adore Meryl Streep, I never liked the music of ABBA.My reactions weren't mixed at all. I hated Mamma Mia: the acting, the story line, the music, the lip-synching, the dancing. It was frivolous, shallow, vapid.Yeah, so? All musicals are frivolous, yet there are many I love. Cabaret. The 2005 version of The Producers. The Sound of Music. What was it about Mamma Mia that riled me so?I think I hated Mamma Mia because it was such a transparently cynical attempt to exploit a stereotype: the ""female demographic"" pandered to by morning news & entertainment shows, The View, Oprah & Doctor Phil, Access Hollywood. I suppose there are women who fit that stereotype, just as there are men who fit the ""male youth demographic"" stereotype movies like Transformers aim at. But I don't have to like it.Meryl, how could you? Where's your pride?"
5,Real Life excellence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"One of the most Excellent movies for all ages. The acting was just superlative. One of the best movies of this day for all age groups.The scenery was breathtaking.A movie is supposed to be entertainment, this was above and beyond.Pierce Brosnan was one of the most heart felt singers plus exceptional acting and chemistry with Meryl Streep. The people at the ""RAZZLE""awards should be ashamed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!His singing would be received by Donna as extremely romantic. The four actresses were also, excellent.The bachelors and her young man also made for a heartwarming Musical ..."
4,Just for fun!,"This is not a movie for people who are looking for a deep, thought provoking two hours. It's for people who are looking for fun, pure fun. It's also for people who are Meryl Streep fans. It's obvious how much fun these A List actors are having with this material. I read somewhere that Colin Firth has said this movie was the most fun he ever had making a movie. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit jarring when the songs don't quite fit the situation. It's obvious that the plot was written around the songs. Musicals work best when the songs are written around the plot. But these are some truly inventive, playful and joyful tunes and the choreography is fresh and energetic. It's just for fun A One!"
3,Mama Mia,"The movie is great. But the BluRay DVD is poor quality. The audio is fine, it's just that the color is often distorted; not HD. I recommend NOT buying this version of the BluRay at this time. I suggest one should wait a while, six months or so, for the producers to get the bugs out of their process. This review is based upon having received a second (replacement) disc from Amazon for the same problem. Too bad. I would ask for another replacement, but I am confident it wouldn't be any better."
2,silly and fun in an awful sort of way,Pierce Brosnan really does suck in this and I think was completely miscast. But it is fun and silly and a harmless way to spend time if you don't mind ABBA music being sung badly. The stage musical was better.
5,Great Movie,"This is a great show, and the first season was excellent. The DVD came in new condition as I expected, and shipping was quick."
3,The trailer would have sufficed,"I'd watched the trailers several times for ""Mamma Mia"" and frankly, they covered the high points of a thin story I felt after watching the full movie. The movie belongs to Meryl Streep and she puts her usual professionalism and fun into the part.The other actors give their all and you can tell that they're having fun with their roles. The setting and camera work is like a travelogue for the Greek isles.It's fun and convenient to have movie rentals through Amazon and save money from either buying or going to a brick and mortar theater. I'm glad that it only cost me $3.99 for this movie."
3,The Memory,I bought this dvd by mistake it was suppose to go to my grandma but it went to me I saw it in theater with a girl it was the only date for a while
5,Mamma Mia,"What can I say?The DVD arrived safe and sound and performed like a DVD should.Quality was fine and played with no problems,"
4,Mamma Mia! blu-ray and audio cd set,"The movie is so much fun. Blu-ray quality is very good.The cd is missing one of Pierce Brosnan's songs - so that was a bit disappointing. Also, I would have preferred that the cd come with it's own packaging within the box."
5,The best musical ever!,"Balanced for both men and women.Great date flick.I don't normally like musicals - this is the best!Ok, Sound of Music was the best.Second best then..."
4,Mamma Mia!,"If you love musical movies and ABBA music, you will like this movie. It is a little on the corny side but overall a decent movie."
5,Very up beat movie,"I gave this movie as gift which was greatly appreciated. Again, the movie qualitly was excellent. Your products are excellent."
4,"Fun, Color, Fun",I love the film because it was colorful and energetic. Although I thought the plot was a little lame the actors did a great attempt at creating a fun musical. It reminded me of The Birdcage.
4,Cute Movie - Live Musical Better,"I was super excited to hear they were making this into a movie...because I adored the musical! However, I think the casting got a little too concerned with big names rather than focusing on the music and dancing. Now, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy it. I did! I do! I just think that some potential was lost with casting choices.All in all - a FUN movie!"
5,Such a fun film!,"There aren't many movies made now that make you HAPPY. This is one that does. It's just a delight to listen to and watch. The actors are having a great time, the music is addictive and the scenery gorgeous. Sit back and enjoy!"
2,Just don't,"I just don't like it. Acting was good, but the singing was just too...ugh. Plus, not a big fan of the storyline. Just me..."
5,Mama Mia Movie,This purchase was guaranteed to be a pleaser because I saw the movie and fell in love with it. So happy to get it at a less expensive price than from a video store.
5,Thank God for the Swedish!,"I love this movie!! it is soooooo cute and it makes you feel so good. it's funny, the music is phenomenal, and everything just works perfectly!the scenery is gorgeous, and Meryl Streep makes us fall in love with her all over again!I love Love ABBA! and i'm glad that their timeless music is being represented this way. If you're gay, you are going to LOVE this movie, so watch it now, It's a definate MUST-SEE!I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS!"
5,"O, Mamamia!!!","Whether or not you know the music of ABBA, it's a romp!This is definitely eye candy. It's Greek island setting is beautiful.It's worth the price just to see Pierce Brosnan sing and dance in disco drag."
5,Great Musical,"This is definately the musical to see! In addition to the great story line and cast, it is set in one of the most beautiful places on earth, the Greek isles! Loved it!"
2,Get the widescreen instead.,"I absolutely adored this movie in theaters and am a big fan. I was very excited my sister got this for me for Christmas but the transfer to fullscreen is just horrible. There is so much ""pan and scan"" that its distracting and half the time someone will say his or her line and you can even see them say it because they got cut off off-screen. Even my non-movie-buff friends said it distracted them. Get the widescreen instead."
3,When the skinny girl sings,"Not much to say about this one. It's too musical for my own tastes, I reocommended it to my 17 year old daughter. The bursting out in song at the beginning turned me off. The movie just didn't work for me. I have heard others say good things about it so I rate it a 3."
5,LOVED it!,I was a fan of ABBA back in the day (but never admitted it out loud) and saw the play when it opened in New York. I LOVED it and I love this movie. It was fun and it made me smile constantly.
4,Very good movie,"I'm not always into musicals, but it is a very good one. Meryl Streep was fabulous as always and I would recommend this movie."
3,Mamma Mia DVD,"I was a little disappointed. I loved the Broadway Show, but the movie was hard to watch. It got very dark in some scenes and you could hardly see what was happening. Plus the story line just didn't hold my interest. The music though was enjoyable."
5,mama mia! movie dvd,"awesome movie , fast shipping , good price, no skipping, glitches , nothing wrong with it at all , its perfect, will purchase again."
5,Mamma Mia,Mamma Mia review. What a good movie !! We have always liked musicals and this one did not disappoint.
2,Disappointing,"Most reviews were so good that I expected to be blown away by this movie. Image quality was not good at all. I thought maybe I had turned off the 1080 setting - but my settings were correct. Acting was good, but this was a musical - and other than the daughter's voice, all others were forgettable. I've watched Phantom more than half a dozen times... I won't waste my time watching Mama Mia again."
5,Great Christmas Gift,I got this as a Christmas gift. It was well received and shipped quickly. Very satisfied.
1,Terrible Movie! Don't bother seeing it.,"The acting and singing was TERRIBLE!!! but the girl on the cover is such an amazing singer. I'll buy her album, but the other well known actors should not have gotten their parts. They were sooo bad. And what was with having some guy (Mr. Darcey) being gay in the movie? Must Hollywood include some gay character in every movie nowadays? How distasteful! Hope there will be a remake, because that didn't do it for me."
1,Quite Atrocious To Watch,"I am a complete ABBA fan, so the thought of watching the movie ""Mamma Mia!"" sounded right up my alley!! Plus the idea of a story revolving around Abba's songs was a novel idea too, which was another reason I was game for watching this movie.Okay, let's just say the story line is cheesy! The singing was horrible and the acting was bad on all counts.... I would have thought with the all star cast of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Barabski, Julie Walters, and so on that this movie would have been great... at the very least acting wise!!I say skip the movie and listen to Abba's Greatest Hits!!"
1,Mama Mia,I really enjoy seeing Meryl Steep in all her movies. But this movie I am sorry I purchased it. I watched the whole movie not understanding what was going on. I was very disspointed in this movie.
3,I have not viewed the video. thus an.average rating/,Amazon is insisting that I write a review. I haven't had a chance to watch the video yet but I saw the stage show and have high expectations of the movie.
3,Mamma Mia! The Movie,"As a musical it was good. I thought the plot rather sophomoric. Good scenery, good acting."
2,Shrink wrap torn when arrived,"I'm sure the movie itself was fine, but there was a huge rip in the shrink wrap when the movie arrived. If I wasn't giving this as a Christmas gift it would not have been a big deal, but since I did not have enought time to return it, I went ahead and gave it as is, hoping the actual movie was not damaged."
1,No relation to music,"Anyone who grew up hearing Abba will be disappointed. The singing voices are mediocre and the acting basically phoned in with the exception of Christine Baranski, a seasoned Broadway actress, who gives an amazing performance. Abba needs to be heard sung by Abba."
1,Golden Girls do Greece,"A fun show on stage, this became ridiculous transferred to the screen because of the casting. The actresses playing Donna and her cronies were all pushing 60 when they filmed this. It should have been played by actors about forty give or take a couple of years. Why did they do this?"
5,Great MOVIE,Arrived in excellent conition. DVD was sealed as described.Love this movie and the music.
2,The most mis-cast movie in history,"The review title says it all. Meryl Streep is a great actress but in this role looked totally out of her element. She appeared wooden throughout. Pierce Brosnan was a joke as a singer. Perhaps with some genuine musical theater stars in the role, it may have worked. Even so, I got so tired of its teeny-bopper mentality, even from the adults, that I soon came to understand why the late-night comedians made such fun of this film. Is it a feel-good film? Yes (my 81-year-old mother-in-law liked it), but much of the ""feel-good"" comes from laughing AT it. The blu-ray transfer was excellent, which befits the great ocean-front scenery, the movie's greatest asset. It sure wasn't the musical performances from Streep and Brosnan."
1,Mamma Mia Doesn't work !!!,"I have never had any problems with an Amazon product. This Blue Ray has been a problem from the start. I sent the first one back to you and you promptly sent me a replacement. My wife and I sat down to watch the second one and it did the same thing. We called the Geek Squad to see if it was our system and it turns out that the second one is defective as well. I will be sending it back this week. Again I love Amazon and feel that you have a bad batch. Hope this helps you. Gary O'Brien, DDS"
1,Don't subject your DVD player to this movie.,"I must admit up front that I didn't enjoy the Broadway show from a story perspective but the music was great. I watched the dvd not expecting anything more from the story but was looking forward to a first class rendition of the songs. The actors and acting are so disconcerting it will be virtually impossible to watch in its entirety for many folks. The vocals are generally horrible and to see Meryl Streep in this movie is like watching a good actor on the Love Boat or Surreal Life...you know their career is over.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this movie from any point of view and could imagine that even great fans of ABBA would find this embarrassing."
2,not impressed,"Having grown up in the disco era, with ABBA on the radio every ten minutes, I thought this would be an interesting and enjoyable movie.I was wrong.It tried too hard in some places, not enough in others, and plodded along for the most part.The pretense was actually quite the setup for a good comedy. Strong actors was a good move also and the location was great! The unfolding of the plot was weak, at best. And it seemed some of the songs just didn't fit well to what was going on.I'm not sure what I would have done differently here... the story was made to be wrapped around songs by the group ABBA. These songs weren't written for that purpose and therefore the fit just isn't quite right.This is definitely a chick flick and geared for the teen section. Which I'm sure it will win over. Myself? I watched it and returned it. Don't think I'll watch it again."
4,Oh so fun,"I have to admit I was a skeptic. I was not a huge fan of ABBA growing up but after the broadway show came out, which I did not see, I started to think maybe I will give it a shot and see what it is about. I like musicals.I sat down on a cold January 4th and watched it. I love it!I think my favorite part of the movie is Dancing Queen. I loved how the older woman carrying sticks on her back just threw them down and joined in the fun.By the way, the other reason I wanted to watch it is because it has Colin Firth in it. Not bad on the vocals.As for Pierce, back off people I have heard a lot worse. I think it catches you off guard more than anything. I have watched it twice now and even the second time, I really don't think he sounds that bad.It says a lot throwing yourself into a role that is completely different from what you normally do. He took a chance and had some fun.I like this movie. Guess I need to check out the Broadway production sometime."
4,Have fun with it!,"This isn't designed to be high art. It's designed to put a smile on your face and, if you're middle-aged, a little nostalgia in your heart. I grinned like an idiot throughout the movie the first time I saw it. You can't help it. The music makes you happy, and the actors are obviously having a good time. Production values? Who cares! That's not what this movie is about. It's about a rolicking good time and a romantic fantasy come true. On those levels, it more than delivers."
5,Great Movie!!,"How often can an 8, 45 & 72 year olds be together and REALLY enjoy a great movie. True - not the stage production - but a lovely, fun movie."
2,Streaming needs work,"My family enjoys the movie just fine, but on Amazon Prime's streaming, the audio continuously desynced with the video. We've never had this issue on any other stream."
4,Mamma Mia,"Great cast, Abba music, charming story. DVD for lower cost is fine. Not a special effects movie so consider Blu-Ray optional. One issue, the digital download that supposedly came with the movie was unavailable. It seems that the dowload offer expired but vendors are still selling old stock and charging as if the complete package is available. Forewarned is forarmed."
5,Mamma Mia it is wondersul!!!!!,Enjoyable beyond description. Saw it in the theater and wanted my own personal copy. I now have it. Well worth the cost.
5,Just What I Wanted,The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described. It was for a Mamma Mia fan. They loved it.
4,ABBA GOLD,"This is one of those movies, that the critics ravaged, but the public loved. One thing is for sure, Meryl Steep can do anything, I mean, could this role have been any different than her recent turn as Miranda Priestly? As for Brosnan, I liked him in this, he gave his all, and get real we all figured he could not hold a tune, I mean, everybody should have one flaw, I mean, right? Really, you cant beat the ABBA tunes in this, they are so gloriously Disco and the Greek Island local is breathtakingly beautiful. One thing is for sure, everybody in this seemed to be having the time of their lives and that sort of thing is contagious, whether the film is Citizen Cane or not."
3,A Musical for a Youthful Audience,"This is a musical first and foremost, make no mistake; it has beautiful scenery, an amusing story line, and lots of music and dancing. If you're into that sort of thing this may well be one you'll like.I would suggest you rent it before buying as it falls into a distinct genre of movie. Several younger members of our family recommended it to us and we watched it and found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of the songs. I'll admit they did enjoy it so you may well enjoy it too; just watch it first and get a feel for what you would be buying."
2,Not for mature adults,This movie is definitely for the younger crowd and not for adult viewing. It is totally nonsensical and not wworth watching.
3,Not the Broadway Show,"I had not seen this movie prior to seeing the Broadway play. After I saw the play, I thought I must see the movie. What a disappointment! The play was outstanding. The movie was okay. It may not be fair to compare the movie to the play. I think my expectations were too high. The singing in the movie was just mediocre. I don't think I would have liked it even if I had not seen the play. It is a good story. The scenery in the movie is fantastic. It is a ""feel good"" movie and I did ""feel good"" after watching it."
4,bluray extras!,"Here's what's Universal has compiled for the bluray edition:Disc One- Feature Commentary with director Phyllida LLoyd- Play with Sing-Along (with on-screen lyrics to 22 musical numbers)- Deleted Scenes- Outtakes- Deleted Musical Number: ""The Name of the Game""- Anatomy of a Musical Number: 'Lay All Your Love on Me'- The Making of Mamma Mia! (from Broadway to Hollywood, join Mamma Mia! as it enchants audiences around the globe)- Becoming a Singer (see how Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan and the rest of the stars brought the ABBA songs to life on the screen!)- A Look Inside Mamma Mia!- ""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"" Music Video (new rendition by actress Amanda Seyfried)- Bjorn Ulvaeus cameo- U Control- Picture-in-Picture- Behind the Hits- BD Live- My Scenes Sharing- Downloadable Content- My Chat- My Mamma Mia! CommentaryDisc Two- Digital Copy of Mamma Mia!"
2,Really dumb,"The best thing about this movie is seeing Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Barananski in a musical. That's a real treat. They did a great job with limited material.However, I'm a little confused at the hype around this movie. Many of the songs just don't make any sense. The whole time that Pierce Brosnan, who really shouldn't be cast in a scene where he sings, is singing to Meryl Streep about how can he go on when she's gone, I'm wondering what he's talking about since he hasn't seen her in twenty years. The only way to enjoy this movie is to never ask what anyone is talking about or why they are doing what they are doing. If you can look at the movie as a series of unrelated music videos then you will be OK."
4,Great well-choreographed performance,"My wife and I first saw this ""show"" on stage and did totally enjoy it. When the movie came out we could not imagine how it would outdo the stage performance. But it does add some amazing scope and dimension to the story through cinematography: the beauty of the islands of Greece, the water, the ""sets"" used in the story and the unique choreography of the ""songs"" scenes did add dimensions which could not be captured by the stage performance. We bought this for our daughter who totally loved it. We'll borrow her copy and look at it to enjoy it again, too."
2,Least Favorite Movie Musical,"I was very excited to watch this movie because it is my wife's favorite musical. I knew the songs would be fun and just be an enjoyable movie to watch. Wow was I wrong. I suffered through an hour and fifty minutes of for the most part terrible singing and hyperactive acting. If your idea for entertainment is listening to Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep sing then go ahead and enjoy.Yes the actors looked like they enjoyed themselves and the song Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia were fun, that is why I gave it two stars rather then one. I felt the acting was over the top and I caught myself laughing at the movie rather then laughing because it was actually funny. I would recommend taking a pass on this one even if you like musicals. Try Hairspray or Phantom of the Opera, those were much much better"
2,Please stick with the stage version,"Being a fan of ABBA, I was looking forward to seeing the movie. However, I found the pacing of the movie incredibly slow compared to the stage play. It was, in a word, boring. To add to the disappointment, the leads (Streep and Brosnan) were not up to the vocal requirements of the score (especially Brosnan). While I enjoy them as actors, they needed to have their voices dubbed or at least their performances improved.The other disappointment was the change of the script towards the end adding the reference about families being of all types. That was not in the original as I remember. That could have been left out. Also, the producers could have left off the tacky ending with the cast parading around in those horrid suits. True, the stage play has that addition but it comes off much better on stage than on screen.If you are a fan of the stage play, I believe you will be disappointed with this version."
3,Streep's Mama Mia,"I was anxiously waiting for this movie after seeing the play and listening to Abba's music often. When I saw the movie in the theater it was good, the large screen with the dark theater made you feel like you were on a Greek Island witnessing this event. Then I ordered the DVD and watched the movie at home - what a difference! I thought to myself, ""This is a dumb movie"".Everyone agrees, the music makes the movie. The plot is thin and it is a silly premise. It works on stage, because in the theater you can use your imagination. It doesn't work in the movie. Unfortunately, I do not think I will ever watch the DVD again; I can listen to the CD and enjoy the music without feeling like I am wasting my time.Meryl Streep is good, she can do anything. She displays many emotions, and does it well. She looks like she had fun making the movie; I hope she was actually enjoying the Greek experience rather than being on a set in Hollywood."
3,Mamma Mia,".Mamma Mia! The Movie (Full Screen)Mamma Mia was, in my opinion ""good"". Not the greatest, some of the actors chosen to play the characters in Mamma Mia were not suited for the roles. I love Pearce Brosnan in anything but he can't sing to save his soul! Meryl Streep is a great actress but not in this role. Not convincing enough. Sorry! I preferred her in ""The Devil Wears Prada""."
4,Great escape!,"I watched this movie on a plane ride to Asia. I admit that I really did not want to - I didn't know ABBA well and I did not hear good reviews. But this was one good thing I discovered in that long plane ride. It was surprisingly entertaining and made me want to dance! I know the plot is very weak and very unrealistic - one star off for that - (come on, who would go to an old lover's daughter wedding when you have not spoken for 20 years??), but I had so much fun. I now own the soundtrack and love blasting it. And every couple months or so, I catch it on HBO since it always puts me in a great mood. Pierce Brosan is a bit hard to listen to, but Meryl Streep makes it up for him!!I highly recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to have a good time!"
4,Love Momma Mia,Loved this movie. The songs are great and the scenes have an amazing background of the Greek Islands. Wonderful!
4,What A Fun Movie!,"I love this movie. So what if all the adult actors look far beyond their 40's, which is the range of the Mother's age in that stage musical! Meryl Streep along with Julie Walters and Christine Baranski clearly make up for poor Pierce Brosnan. Heck, who ever said he could sing? I don't care about that bit even. I love Pierce and he can do no wrong! Granted I do have to sort of cover my ears when I'm watching the movie and he's singing...but so what. He took the role to work with Meryl and, after all, who wouldn't? If you have the chance, catch the stage musical! However, if you can't afford a trip to New York, then grab a copy of the film, which is the next best thing. This is a delightful movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a vintage bottle of wine with some crackers and dip!"
1,Ma Ma Mia! My Ma Ma Mia DVD hasn't aArrived Yet,"The item was ordered on 12/8, supposedly shipped on 12/14, and as of today (January 7th) had not arrived. I was asked by e-mail to rate the product, but all I can report is that it is not here yet.Amazon is replacing it with a new DVD, to be delivered tomorrow, so hopefully I'll be able to review it later this week."
1,Worst Movie EVER,"Can you remember the worst movie you've ever seen? Well ""Mama Mia"" has it beat! The super-simple plot is constantly interrupted by people breaking out in song. It is ridiculous and creepy. Downright icky."
1,Here We Go Again,"Look, I'm here to help you. Hopefully, you'll read this review before the Holidays and you'll buy or rent something worthy of your friends and family to view, something like Sin City or Death Proof but please God, not Mamma Mia. This film is so bad that the people who didn't walk out after 15 minutes decided it was better to just make fun of it by making inappropriate and often times hilarious comments throughout. There's you're warning. Now if you're still intent on seeing this film because Meryl Streep is in it, I want you to remember one thing. This is the same woman who made She-Devil with Roseanne Bar in 1989. Save yourselves.Your welcome."
1,"Love ABBA, hate the movie","I grew up with ABBA through high school and they have always been a guilty pleasure so I was really looking forward to this movie. (I haven't had a chance to see the play.) What a disappointment. The singing was terrible (with the exception of the daughter) and the acting just as bad. I haven't seen a musical this embarrassing since ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (which at least had decent singing but was still so bad it managed to effectively kill the careers of both the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton)."
2,Mama what have I done to diserve this?,"Mama mia what have I done to deserve this? Well, at least I can return it.I had high hopes and was excited to watch this film and felt like I just wasted my life.Dont get me wrong, I love showtunes but this one was a HUGE let down.I like only the very few ABBA songs used, and the others to me werent my favorite.The singing was not the greatest either. I wont pick the cons out b/c most negative reviews explain everything that I didnt like about this film.Plus its total chickflicks, I dont like chickflicks and Im a chick. I'll stick with ALW, Moulin rouge, the marraige of figaro, sweeney todd and repo, thankyou. At least with the few crappy songs in those shows, I leave happy. ^_^Also it beats me buying overpriced tickets to the actual show and be disappointed. ^_^"
1,DVD didn't work.,"I was very disappointed witht this DVD. It was advertised as being in good condition, but when I got it, there are so many scratches that it skips about half the movie."
5,Love love love Mama Mia,"I've still not gone through all the features, but have used the free digital download to put the movie in my Iphone. Love it!"
4,"Decent Movie, Good Soundtrack","Good movie and the extras are cool (if you like Karaoke). Also, you can jump to any of the songs from the main menu."
4,Mamma Mai - The movie,After seeing it on the stage and twice at the theator I thought it was great. I pre-order the DVD and it got to the house a day before it's release.
4,alechile,"it's a great, funny and up beat movie, you see it and feel like singing, if you like ABBA you'll love this movie"
5,an opportunity to feel something warm,I can only say one thing about this movie funny and warm. Merly strip on the role of Donna Sheridan one word delicious after watching this great movie all want a mom like her. all the cast are great even Pierce Brosnan singing hehehe (give him an opportunity)the colors of the movie are brilliant and spectacular scenes in greece.Abba music takes you on a ride of emotions from joy to sadness and hope.buy 100% recommend this movie for fans of musicals and for those who are not fans after see this movie you going to be a fan.
3,Mamma Mia,Amazon did a great job assuring I receive it on time. However I thought the movie was certainly not even close to the musical play. I was disappointed. I have no idea how anyone could nominate it for an award. Very disappointed.
1,Disappointing,Even the great Meryl Streep could not save this movie. Musicals should be made with actors who can sing. That was not a requirement for this movie obviously.
1,"Stink, stank, stunk!","This movie was just awful.....painful to watch. I can't believe that people thought this was a good film. I really likeABBA, sorry that this movie tried to desecrate their songs by prostituting them in such a badly written movie."
5,Wonderful movie,"What fun. Lots of great acting, singing, and dancing. Scenery is great. Very enjoyable."
2,momma mia,fun movie very poor singing and a little dull.Only the young couple could sing well .Scenery was nice.
5,Loved Mamma Mia!,"I have watched this movie twice in one day and I laugh out loud every single time. As far as Pierce Brosnan goes - it makes it all the more realistic of a love story - not everyone in the world is an opera singer. The movie is fun, entertaining and I LOVE ABBA music - what a great combination! Don't miss it!"
5,Mamma Mia! is spectacular,"Best musical in many years. Story and music test credulity, but so did West Side Story and The Mikado. Performances are spot on, with average talent in some roles being lifted to very good by enthusiasm and professionalism--Brosnan is best example. The four leading ladies are breathtaking. It's not Abba, and not meant to be. The Abba music is transformed into a different form by its original composers and criticizing it as 'pop' simply misses the point. It was great music in the 70's (second only to the Beatles, worldwide) and has been re-imagined as great music in this century."
5,It Is The Best!,"I love this movie, I watch it every week. I know all the lines, songs everything! It is very addictive watching. Everyone is well cast."
5,Cannot Wait for Mamma Mia!,"I also loved this movie and saw it several times. I too wonder sometimes if the critics and I saw the same film. Mamma Mia! made me feel happy, and like other reviewers here, I was bopping along with the music. I've rarely seen such chemistry in a cast, and they truly looked like they were having a ball! (If this cast was faking that, they should all get Oscars.) Pierce Brosnan might not have the greatest singing voice, but his acting was superb. And who knew that Colin Firth could sing so well! But it was Meryl Streep's ""The Winner Takes It All"" that gave me goosebumps. My friends and I will all be buying Mamma Mia! when it is released."
5,Bottom line...,"The bottom line is...if this movie doesn't make you smile then you have bigger problems than Pierce Brosnan's voice or ""questionable cinematography""....watch it while you're home alone if you need to, but I DARE you not to smile!!! :-)"
5,"Oh ,,,MAMMA MIA !!!!!","Just love this movie ,,,scenery ,good music ,great acting ,,,what more doU need to have the feeling of beeing right there at that island !!!!!Thank ""U"" OMA"
1,Oh My Noooo,"...Unless you're in an altered state, I just --You'd have to hog-tie me to make me see this movie again.To go into details is too negative, so I'll just say... .. Oh my goodness Singing (except for Amanda, who is Wonderful): Pass...Choreography? Please~ No More!!!! No! Pass! Passss!!!!{ ) Save yourself the Pain and the 2 hours of your life you'll NEVER get back! Pass!!!!"
1,Mama Mia-the movie,Mamma Mia! The Movie (Widescreen)The story is cute. The singing voices are mostly terrible and all of it was drowned out by the loud music that accompanied the singing.
1,Bad Beyond Words,"Words cannot express how bad this movie is.- Michael Erlewine, Founder All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)"
1,Pretty Awful actually,"How lame was the bit with Pierce Brosnan singing and punching his fist in the air, ""real manly stuff"" and to think this girlie man was once James Bond.And Merryl Streep still can't act."
1,Indescribably Awful,"This was the worst movie that I have ever seen. It was so bad, that it was painful to watch. I can't understand how you can gather some of the best actors on the planet, with some of the best music ever produced, and not be able to come up with even three minutes of watchable film. ?????I could have picked random people off of the street, had them write their own tunes, and film it on a camcorder, and I swear that it would have been more interesting than this unbelievably horrifying excuse for a film. And this has to be said: Anybody who liked this movie must be so insanely starved for entertainment that they'd be amused by watching a plant grow."
3,good,"(+) it was shipped fast.(+) it was shipped in an envelope with bubble wrap lining in it. content was great.(-) it wasn't a blue ray official case (the blue kind). It was a black dvd case, with the mamma-mia cover. Since it was for a gift, I was saddened by that.Overall good review. I'll read more specifically next time what kind of case it'll come in. If not specified, I'd ask first. :o)"
3,Mamm Mia Purchase,"The Manufacture is not at fault, but I received a used product that was rated as in very good condition, and it continually stops in one certain place, even after carefully cleaning the product. We can jump over the bad spot and view the remaining portion without conflict, thus for the price we paid I rated this product three stars."
5,Great show,I loved the show. A lot of big names playing roles and singing like you have never seen them before. I was disappointed in the shipping. I ordered it on 12/16/08 and was promised pre Christmas delivery. It did not arrive until after New Years.
3,Bomba Mia,"Wasn't prepared for the musical aspect of this film, considering most of the actors can""t sing. Story was a bit trite"
4,My big musical Greek wedding,"If you have grown up with the music of Abba or have seen the musical & love movies that make you dance, smile & even sing along..this one is for you..It has a great starcast & has been produced & directed by women.shot mostly in Greece & major portions on europes largest studio/ set.this BLU RAY disc you will love to see again & again.It has great picture & sound quality.Interesting Bonus features: Including Deleted scenes, deleted song, dialouges. even a great music video, plus making of a song secene & making of the movie itself,plus some more..only wish they had included the Music CD..wish our weddings were half the fun."
5,Blast of musical fun and humor! Always loved ABBA. The 2nd Disc contains:,"Per Wikipedia:*Two-disc special edition*The widescreen single-disc includes a bonus disc which includes:--Limited time only digital copy--Deleted scenes--Outtakes--The Making of Mamma Mia! featurette--Anatomy of a Musical Number: ""Lay All Your Love on Me""--Becoming a Singer featurette--Behind the scenes with Amanda--On Location in Greece featurette--A Look Inside Mamma Mia! featurette--""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!"" music video--Björn Ulvaeus cameoSome 2-disc special editions come with a bonus soundtrack."
3,See this before the live show then you will know how mediocre it is.,I think they could have found actors with better voices but big names sell tickets. Was ok but the Broadway show is 100 times better.
5,Mama Mia video,I love that I can take it with me and enjoy it over and over again on the convenience of the fire.
2,I love the music... I hated the movie,"I LOVE ABBA... I might even say I liked Mamma Mia, on stage. (I saw it two times, on stage...)But I HATE the movie. Total miss-cast. Merryl Streep SINGING? And Pierce Brosnan? Are you kidding? Who ever chose Merryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan for this movie, when they could have chosen good SINGERS... A SINGER-ACTRESS, like Barbara Streisand, or Madonna, either one of who can act as well as sing... whatever happened to Antonio Banderas, why wasn't he in this movie?And Merryl Streep is NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR, for this silly movie... and Kate Blanchett is NOT nominated for an Oscar... that's Hollywood justice for you.I give it two stars... I can't give it less, because I love the ABBA songs, anyways... even with BAD SINGERS the songs come through. But it really is a toss-up between 1 and 2 stars, and I was lenient."
5,Great chick flick and sing-along movie,"Meryl Streep is amazing as she always is but she actually pulls off a singing character. Other main characters except for the daughter, just barely get by with their singing. Makes you want to get up and sing and dance."
4,"It's So Great To Have Three Fathers, But It's Better To Know Which One Is The Actual Father","I love that this movie revolves around love, a universal subject. Terrific songs from Abba!! My personal favourite song in the film is Our Last Summer, which I definitely have on my ipod. I love that Amanda's character has three fathers, but I think they should have shown the real father. I wanted to know as a viewer, and I was a bit disappointed when they didn't specify which one was her actual father. I love that she contacted them without the knowledge and approval of her mother. Great story, great actors, and great acting so I recommend to all."
5,So much fun!,The Girls around this house love to watch this and sometimes to sing along! I'm not much on musicals but this is engaging fun.
4,The stage version is better,"I saw this on stage when the traveling show came to Philly, and it works much better when the characters can sing. Pierce Brosnan shouldn't be singing in a movie, and I just don't get the casting of Meryl Streep as Donna. Sophie is supposed to be a 20 year old, and Donna was supposed to be young when she got pregnant and should be 40 years old or less. Streep is getting close to 60, so that was bad casting.Having said that, I got this for my daughter, and have had to sit through it probably 20 times now, so the singing isn't bothering me as much as it did at first, but the casting still doesn't work for me."
5,Mamma Mia a Must for all Mom's and Daughters!,Oh my goodness...My daughters and I loooooooooooved this movie. We laughed and cried and laughed and cried an sang along. Watched it with my mom and did the same thing all over again. Watched it with my sister and did it all over again with her too. Finally got the movie as a gift for my mom for mother's day. Everyone should have this movie in their home collection.
5,An unparalleled joy of a film.... !,"From the gorgeous prologue scene with Sophie singing ""I have a dream..."" in the skiff, to the hillarious credits with the cast breaking up while mock-performing, this is a joy of a film to watch and experience. One of my favorites of all time.The first time that I viewed it I found it mesmerizing... the fantastic scenery, the most beautiful water scenes that I have ever witnessed, and then the music... the music! I ended up seeing it a half-dozen times in the theater, and never once did I not feel a flood of true joy bursting out from the spirit and beauty of this special film."
5,Mamma Mia a winner,I loved this movie. It was the first interactive movie experience in a very long time. It was obvious the audience loved it and it got women up in their seats dancing. The enjoyment was contagious.
4,"Great movie, tiresome trailer","Loved the movie, great sound, quirky storyline. Intro trailer was too long with advertising going on forever. Recomended for fans of ABBA."
5,Great family fun,Rec'd the DVD within a few days after it released. I had it shipped direct to my son's home and it arrived the day after I did. We enjoyedwatching with the whole family.
5,I love this movie and I do not like most musicals.,"It is a fun, uplifting movie. If you are a baby boomer it has special significance. If you are younger, well you can have a good time learning a bit about what it was like to be one and the child of one. I LIKE IT ! ...Oscar"
4,"Great movie, so so blu-ray.",This is a 5-star movie on a 3 star quality blu-ray. There are spots where the visual actions blurs across the screen. I have seen this on many of my blu-rays but it seems the newer ones are improving.
5,Mamma Mia,This movie is lot's of fun. I had seen it before but wanted a copy for myself. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals and humor.
5,Mama Mia delivered,Mama Mia the price was reasonable and it was delivered promptly.Thank you for the great product and service.
4,entertaining sentimental musical fluff high-energy for anyone nostalgic,"Some will probably condemn this movie, but I enjoyed it. It is silly and fun, a guilty pleasure. Lots of singing and dancing, and new interpretations of ABBA songs. Dozens of music and dance scenes were packed into one movie. I was amazed any time was left for a plot, but yes, there was a plot, and it was not entirely predictable. Colorful sets and costumes. High-energy music/dance scenes, some of which involved a surprisingly large crowd of performers."
1,Lights went out after 5 days,Tree is horrible. (We got the clear lights version) Comes in three sections. Half of the bottom section went out after two days and kept blowing fuses. The entire top half of the tree went out after day five. Tree does not go all the way to the floor. Will be sending back for a refund. SAFETY HAZARD!!!!
3,Works on smooth surfaces only,"This squeege has a wide blade which makes quick work of the shower water however, our shower floor is textured as is the threshold and the glass door. This squeege is not at all flexible and does not work on the textured surfaces. It works very well on the smooth marble walls."
5,Great Squeegee,"Awesome squeegee. Purchased it to take care of our new granite shower. Works perfect on the granite as well as the glass shower doors. The maker ""InterDesign"" makes some of the best products for your home. I highly recommend this squeegee. Fits in nicely with your stainless steel, nickel and chrome fixtures."
2,Buy a different one.,I was very disapointed in this product. The suction cup to hold up the product was too hard so didn't stick to the wall at all. The squegee left streeks in my shower door from the first uses. The stanless steel handel started to rust the first week.
1,"Too narrow, doesn't work well","I had to send it back, it doesn't do a good job at removing water from glass shower walls/doors. It was difficult to get it to be flat against the glass. I ordered it because I have another wider wonderful squeege from Interdesign but this one was nothing like that one!"
3,"Good, depending on who you are","This mouthpiece is pretty good for a beginner, but if you're an upper level baritone player, this mouthpiece is way too efficient. It has a really high baffle so you don't need as much air plus, I think it sounds edgier especially in the higher register. But for a beginner saxophonists, it'll be ok, just when you switch to a mouthpiece with a lower baffle, you will have to use a lot more air."
3,"Good mouthpiece, great price","Its narrow, does not come with a cover or ligature. Because its narrow, the Rovnor Tenor ligature fits as does the cover that comes with it."
3,Baritone MouthPiece,"Average m/p fair sound. good for a extra, or regular playing. a little large. good shipping.Graftonite Mouthpieces - Baritone Sax #B5Good for the price, better then stock in most cases."
2,It's a keeper!,"Somewhere out there is a ""cheesiest romance novel award"" at this book deserves it. I've read tons of romance novels over the years and for me this hit a new level of corniness."
2,"Disappointing ""sequel"" to classic album","The eagerly awaited follow-up to ""Colin James and The Little Big Band"" fails to ever really get off the ground. The first album was a departure from then current popular music and incorporated aspects of 50's swing, blues, and big-band. With swing now a revived musical phenomena, LBBII finds James playing it safe and sticking to formula. There is little to distinguish this album from the current onslaught of ""modern swing"". Better for the discriminating listener to seek out the masterful and (sadly) out-of-print 1993 album."
5,Colin is TOPS!,"A complete departure from the Colin James of the past, this CD is a MUST for the swing enthusiast! But be forwarned, not only will it set your toes to tapping, it will want to make you DANCE!"
5,Amazing,"What more can a person ask for? Prince plays drums, keyboard, piano, and guitar. To watch him perform with Lenny Kravitz is fantastic. Prince plays the guitar like a true ARTIST. This DVD is a definite must buy."
3,I thought the artist and songs was entertaining but...,"The sound on the DVD, the crowd (be it the way they actually were OR how Prince & crew made them sound on DVD), the camera...bad, bad, bad and made it for a horrible DVD. Unless you are a devoted Prince fan...pass on it."
5,The Prince Returns To His Kingdom,"The Purple One is back and with a vengence..This Dvd showcases a live greatest hits as prince tears thorugh the songs like a man on a mission. Myself being a Prince fan coouldn't wait to view this DVD and it didn't disappoint. Prince is at his best live, and this Dvd show he is truly the 20 centuries Beethoveen. He remains a musical genius, and while his newer stuff hasn't bee as popular it has always been innovative.. And it is said you can't know where your going until you know where you've been. This DVD serves as a musical reminerd to what a genius we have amongst us."
5,Prince - Rave un2 The year 2000,This DVD is AWESOME! Loved every single second of it. I never realized prince played so many instruments. I definitely recommend this DVD to any Prince fan.
2,very average i got spoiled by Sign O The TImes,while Prince is one of my all time favorites this Show didn't do it for me.the band wasn't happening&Prince just wasn't with the Groove.even my Jam She's Always in My Hair was boring.it was cool with him&Lenny doing there thing.Larry Graham was alright but overall this is far below Sign O The Times.The Band was not happening&the Greatest hits just didn't move me this time.but i heard he has a new band&album coming so we shall see.
3,Rave un2 the joyalright....???,"well i was 1 of the few lucky 1nes 2 attend this event, that cold minnesota night...the live show was amazing,with lenny kravitz,clinton and many stars n celebs in attendance that night...but i thought the video failed 2 bring out the excitment i had that night,along with the crowd and energy of the performance...it was a great video, dont get me wrong!!! but its just missing something... along with that, the songs and performances range from mouthdropping 2 dull,kravitz n prince was a dream come true to see this playing on stage 2gether, and the time was a cool flashback...overall this video is worth buying if u are a huge prince fan, but 4 some of the lucky 1nes who attended that night, its a tease.... just buy it peace morpheus"
2,Not A Very Good Effort !,"I have to say that I am disappointed :( I was very exited to hear that ""Prince"" was doing some of his old material for this project. However the songs just did not sound the same, the whole show was very weird. Prince clowned around too much and did not concentrate in sounding good. Honestly, I would return the DVD it if I could. I think that a great opportunity was wasted. The stage was too small, the crowd was dead, the musicians were dressed retro style (boring), the camera angles were really bad. If I have to mention something positive, I will say that the sound is incredible!"
5,Fascinating!,"This was a fascinating book - but had the exact opposite effect on me as I think was intended. Young women having grown up in the Mao era telling their own personal stories (horrible things) with little to no affect. It made them seem almost ""brain-washed"". And I think they were trying to say that things weren't so bad. I found it quite sad, but very fascinating."
5,LOVE this series of books!!,"Love, love, love the Bears stories! I think I should put my TV in a closet, tho I do not watch a lot of television:) I LOVE books"
5,Condition NEW as stated,"Needed for a children's program, was reasonably priced and received in new condition in time expected."
4,Too Much TV,"The Berenstain Bear's have television issues, like lots of kids. They love too watch it, and their poppa,daddy,enjoys it too! The family members sometimes, watch it too much, so Momma bear devises a plan......But, will it work?This may get kids thinking of wats to avoid too much TV."
1,Terrible book,"Papa bear is extremely obviously non compliant, and while at the end the cubs want to do other things he still continues to watch TV. The last sentence says that he decides to then do something else - it just portrays him as being worse than the kids. The argument for not watching TV doesn't fly too much either - the kids go from watching it all the time to not wanting to watch it at all - would have been better if they just watched it less or something. I just did not like this book at all."
3,T.V. WHO ?,We actually did without T.V. for a week. This was the best experiment we have done in a long time. Papa still watches a lot. Brother and sister still want to. Mama has the remote.!
1,Papa Bearenstain Treated as a Child,"As with many books in the Bearenstain series of books, published by Zondervan the Christian book publisher, the father is surprisingly relegated to status as one of the children. He becomes the castrato section of the characters of the story, as when he shirks doing his chores assigned by Mama Bear in the Chore book. This TV book is much needed, however it can help create problems with proper respect for parents with the dominant portrayal of Mama Bear who constantly has to put up with Papa Bear's bad habits while she is remediating the children. Transactional analysis applied to the Berenstain series would assign the parent (mama) to child (Papa)relationship.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394865707/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"
4,Problems with TV?,"When the bears have a problem with too much tv, mamma bear goes into action. The bears learn that too much tv is not a good thing."
2,"This book is boring, lets watch TV","Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text. This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read. I lost attention, and attentiveness. My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone. If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary."
4,Excellent children's morality story.,"This book is a delightful little story told and illustrated in the quality typical of the Berenstains. It has a clear message without being preachy, and presents the need to balance different activities in our lives. I purchased to give me a starting point to talk to my six-year-old-son about watching too much television, and I will say it fulfilled this purpose admirably. I don't think it's quite as entertaining to children as some of the Berenstains' other works, however. Still, an enjoyable story."
4,I liked this book as a kid and still do,I loved the illustrations in the book and how mama bear was trying to show her family there is more to life than television. BUT when I read this book I couldn't really relate cause I was addicted to tv and it was hard not to be when it was always on. You can tell the book came out in the 80's too since there is no internet and brother bear is playing with a rubik's cube.
4,"They should probably make a Too Much Internet book too, lol","I think there's a very good reason that this book series has spanned decades and maintained popularity. It gives children the chance to think on their own and make their own choices for behaviors that carry over into their adult lives. Many of these issues will be ones that will persist through their lives, just on different levels of course.I know I still have times when I watch a lot of television and start to wonder if I'm becoming a couch potato. Books like these at least make me *think* about it now as an adult."
1,junk for the price,I paid $13.48 for it. It's worth maybe $1.50. Just a slight step above the birthdayparty 99 cent hat. I didn't expect a real fireman's hat but for $13.48 I did expecta much better hat.
2,Nice but can't seem to solve for N,"This is my first financial calculator.. I bought it to use in my first Business Finance class of which... i found out for some reason this calculator likes to round up N (number of years). You can't program it so it doesn't round up. Verdict... you have to jump through a few hoops of which i still have to talk to an HP ""specialist"" about so i can figure out how to get an ALMOST accurate answer. I wish i would have bought a different calculator... i won't ever get the correct answer for my tests. HP should have thought of this. They aren't open on the weekends to ask any questions about and my search using the web for a resolution came up empty handed."
1,quality no longer evidenced-sticking keys a trend?,Have previously purchased three HP 12C calculators over the years. The third one developed a problem with the #3 sticking and then becoming unresponsive. Purchased a forth and found immediately that the decimal key must be held for several seconds to have a chance of working.The first two HP 12C are over 15 years old and work perfectly so the quality in producing these calculators seems to have greatly diminished.Will not purchase another.
3,HP12c poorly redesigned,"This calculator is no longer made in the US, the battery has been updated from three cells to one, and the quality has been cheapened. If you are looking to replace an older three cell machine, try out the new design first. The fit, finish, and durability that made these calculators legendary is not what it used to be. The manual also has not been updated to reflect these changes and instructs you to replace three battery cells. The fuctions are all the same, as is the form-factor, soI'm assuming the performance will be similar; just not the quality and robustness. This review written regarding an 8/03 model."
4,It is finance,"There is nothing that shouts 'quant jock' lounder than this bad boy. Because you would only imagine using this in learning FIN I, it begins to shape your thinking (scary) about how to set up financing calculations. I do find myself at a loss when it is not around I have to think back (uncertainly) through the real math behind 'the brain', but I have found a patchwork solution. After you've bought one of these I would recommend downloading the shareware version for your Palm. That way you'll always have it handy. Amazing case study of embedding an operating system in people's brains."
4,Very pleased.,I am very satisfied with the product. I would of liked to have an owners manual with it. But still very satisfied with condition.
5,Excellent,The item was in excellent condition and the shipping was timely and well packaged.I have used such a calculator before and this one replaces one I have used for over 20 years. I expect this new one to be of comparable quality.
5,A good experiance,The order came as promiced in great condition. the experianced will make ordering in the future a plesent experiance. I bought it as a gift and the party who recieved it loved it.
3,Dinosour's tool; CFA Exam requires it,"Let's be real, what financial professional uses calculator over computer (answer:the one who grew up w/o computers)!Designed in the 1980s and with electrical engineer's origins, this calculator uses Reverse Polish Nottion which is neither intuitive (to non-engineers) nor useful, if you are used to solving problems algebraically. It's continued use is supported by professors and professionals who grew up in the are before computers.For students: I recommend a cheaper HP ot TI (BA II Plus) versions, as most of the finance work is done on computers, so you need calculators only for in-class exercises.For finance professionals: Ditto!If you need to take the CFA exam, they still require this machine.Otherwise, the calculator is sturdy, works well (although slow on complex calculations) and is widely used."
1,Why put yourself through the pain???,"Do NOT get this calculator. It is old, outdated, non-intuitive and slow. There is a better choice that is just as (if not more) accepted in the financial world: the HP 17bII (now 17bII+).Even if you're an RPN addict, the 17bII gives you full optionality over RPN and normal inputs. Aren't you tired of watching the screen say ""running"" while you wait for an IRR to calc? Ditch your 12c and upgrade."
2,HP HP 12C Financial Calculator,"Although I am certain this calculator will someday serve me as I expected when I purchased it, it is hard to learn. I suggest having a course on the fundamental usages. There should be a ""manual for dummies"" or first time users guide. It is very difficult to understand."
1,Display crapped out,"About a year after I purchased, one of the digit places lost two bars, so now it's nearly impossible to read the digit. I called HP tech support. They went through the reset drills with me. Nada. Since my 1-year warranty had expired, the guy told me I was out of luck. I never took this calculator out of my office, and I never spilled a thing on it. I had another 12-c for over 20 years. I will never buy another HP product. Grumpy? Maybe, but HP could have made me a champion of their brand by offering to fix it for a small fee. Or not. I'm out."
2,HP 12c Calculator,"HP has significantly changed the way they design or manufacture their calculators over the years. I purchased my first HP 12c more than 15 years ago, and now that it has been dropped more than a ""million"" times I decided to get a replacement. Compared to my original HP 12c, the new one I received has a ""slower"" processor and the numbers seem to ""creep"" up to the display (I've check the performance with multiple sets of batteries). Also, the keys do not seem to have a firm ""detent"" and one needs to check the numbers before entering or performing any calculations. These two issues alone compel me to question the integrity of HP products - currently and future purchases. The bottom line.... I feel I should have spent $10 for this calc rather then the $70 HP asked for. The HP 12c is not being built as a ""Sherman Tank"" any more, so I would certainly look around before settling on an accurate, robust calculator you can depend on."
1,"terrible, dont waste your money buying it here",poorly manyufactured. I have that is approx 15 yrs old and while slower has never let me down. This is the second and last one I ordered from amazon the first one the 1 didnt work at all this time the replacement has numbers that stick! Made in China of course
2,Bill,"I have owned and used a 12C for more than 25 years. I just just bought my 3rd 12C and I have to say I am really disappointed in the quality of the product. This product is a cash cow for HP and it seems they are trying to squeeze more margin out of an already high margin product by cutting corners which reduces the quality. Prime example are the keys. In the past the keys were well fitted in the calculator casing to give it a solid feel. Now the keys jiggle within the casing, especially if you hold it upside down and lightly shake it back and forth. I would suggest HP to have a serious discussion with the product manager in charge of the 12C. You have gone from a quality product to a cheap Chinese knock off. Had I known this when I bought it I would have found another alternative."
2,Great Calculator But New Version Disappointed,"I have used the HP-12c for years and wanted to get an extra, hoping to get a complete set of user manuals. The ""new"" HP-12C arrived in original packaging but I was disappointed that HP chose to not provide the printed user manuals, instead they sent one small booklet and then a CD. Also, it was not possible to get the calculator into the case, the fit was just too tight. After pushing the calculator into the case, it tore in the bottom corner. HP always did a nice job with their calculators, but the cheapness of the case and lack of manuals did not impress me, I guess compromising quality is a way to save money. One area they went all out for was the packaging, Getting this thing out of the package was a chore!!!"
3,Alright,It performs as I expected. It completes the calculations that I need it to do. I was advised by a broker that there are much better calculators for a lot cheaper. I even found one for free as an iphone app
4,It's an HP,"This HP works really well and is very handy, powerful, and flexible financial tool. If you are an engineer you will probably have to get used to a change in notation. It appears the calculator is laid out more for financial professionals day to day use than engineers studying engineering economy. Probably should be that way. One of the great things about this HP and most others is that there is a quick reference guide printed on the back."
1,Failed out of box; not the 12C you remember,"If, like me, you have nostalgia for the HP 12C, you may be disappointed by the new ones. Mostly I noticed it in the edges of the keys. They were sharper, less rounded.Still I would have kept it (my old one had died after 15 years), if the darned thing had worked. But it did not. After a few keystrokes, it would simply shut down. I suspect that wherever HP is outsourcing the manufacture of this to is not watching the quality control."
5,Great calculator for investment banker or real estate professional,This is the industry standard and works great. Amazon had the best price when I went to purchase this.
5,Calculator,Good price - works great - wished I could find more time to use it - or really had a use for it. I would order again.
1,One expensive paperweight,What reason is there to buy a calculator TODAY that was designed a quarter of a century ago? And at THAT price? I thought people who work in finance knew how to put their money to better use.
4,Rev HP 12C,"HP 12C is an excellent product. Robust, very easy to handle, comes with a nice leather case. There is a higher version of same product but only HP 12C and TI BA II plus are allowed in CFA.I search the same product from different website.

5,Fantastic Calculator,"This is a little gem of a finance calculator. While I can't speak for BA-II specific model, compared to other TI calculators I've owned (TI-83,TI-36) the HP12C certainly better made. The buttons have a more tactile feel and solid to the touch.While the RPN takes a little breathing room to get used to, when you get the hang of it it is actually much more efficient working with.This is the one you want to take to your CFA exam."
5,An old friend... had to buy a replacement for one that broke,"If you are looking at this, you probably already know what this cranky calculator does. Mine is like an old friend. I dont like using anything else. Tricky at first, but once you get used to it there is no going back. I prefer the layout of the 12C to other reverse polish calculators."
2,"Good functionality, but not durable like old HPs","I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless. I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register). No drops, no abuse. The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic. The keys feel hollow and light. The available functions are great. This is a classic calculator. But the functions are no good if the keys stop working..."
5,Fast response,"They were very helpful in a problem with my order, shipped out a certain part for no charge. Very good service"
5,simply the best!,"This calculator is for those who believe 'only the best is good enough'. It is stylish because of its original design, its classic, it is solid and feels good in your hands. I bought it recently and I love it. recomended for those who think diffrent! ;)"
4,It's not a TI,"I had to get this calculator for work, and it does the job, but it's kinda slow and looks kinda clunky. I guess that can be expected since it was first produced 20+ years ago and the design hasn't changed at all. RPN (reverse polish notation) takes some getting used to, but it's fine. I still prefer algebraic entry though. The thing is, if you have a job that involves finance, there really is no other calculator that you can buy unless you don't mind being ridiculed by your coworkers."
3,Slow and expensive,"The calculator is very slow, like 20 secs to calculate the interest on a loan. Maybe they should replace the 'running' prompt with 'crawling' or something. I didn't have any problem to adjust to the reverse system but the keys have become mushy and unreliable after less than 1 year of moderate use.For nostalgics only, I'm afraid."
1,Calculator does not work properly,"I am writing this review, because even though it's a great calculator, unfortunately it does not work properly (I have problems with key #1, needs to be pushed too strong and then it ""prints"" number 1 twice at least), and I do not know who to contact or what to do to raise this problem."
3,Awesome calculator Cheap case,the calculator works great. a real classic.however the case that came with it is a joke. it looks and feels cheap (made of fake leather-like material).
2,A ONCE GREAT PRODUCT - NOW SIMPLY CEAP AND TAWDRY,"I use the HP12c almost every day for financial planning and have worn out four of them.Each time I buy a replacement, I am surprised by the reduced quality.The last one I purchased works, but its a bit of junk. Shame on you HP. For this price I don't need sticky keys, a degraded case, and a fragile cover.If you can find an old one, in good condition, buy that. At this price, HP should be building a quality product, but alas, they now build junk.HP has, unfortunately, lost its way."
4,There's an app for that!,"If you already have an iPhone you can get an app that imitates the HP 12c precisely and it costs less than three dollars. The calculations are perfect, they haven't failed me yet!"
5,They'll be giving them away in Cornflakes packets next!,"I teach finance, have used this calculator (and very few replacements in that time) for close to 30 years. I've tried other calculators from HP (various 17B and 19B versions) but nobody is ever going to pursuade me to change. I even have an additional 12C that I keep just for Black-Scholes pricing of options. It can price calls and puts, figure out implied volatility and the delta, and uses all 99 lines of the program (if anyone wants a copy of the program, just e-mail me). It's a great nuisance(!!!) if you ever inadvertantly erase the program, which is why, at this price, I can keep an HP-12C just for options -- I call it ""my BS calculator.""At a price of around $60, this could be the finest investment you'll ever make."
3,"same-o product, cheaper parts...","I've owned one since 1984 when I was in college...I still have mine (only replaced the battery twice so far since--it uses three watch batteries). I had misplaced it somewhere and had to order a replacement...Amazon is great for this-got it nicely and quick. the new HP12C now has cheap plasticky buttons (and sounds like it too when you tap on them)...some better enhancements?: one single flat battery...and a faster processing chip..as if a few nanoseconds are going to make a difference in calculation time??!! but better than nothing right? anyway, it's not that you'll be able to buy the old (better-made) model, but perhaps you may want to look at the anniversary edition (i have not checked it out)...overall, it's still a great product...btw, i did find my old HP12C, so am back to using it again...the new one sits in the drawer as a backup...lol"
3,What I needed,I needed this calculator for a college class and everywhere else I looked was well over $90 and usually $100. I didn't want to spend that much so Amazon was a great solution. I even was able to sell it back through Amazon!
3,Good at Office :Not recommended for CFA Exams,"Perhaps the best non-programmable hand held calculator.Unlike the desktop computer very portable and accurate. Every loans officer , Invesment officer, Lease manager should have one.For the CFA candidate the key strokes are too time consuming .You may even forget the process. Use the alternative calculator."
2,HP12C Financial Calculator,"I was annoyed to discover that in tvm calculations the machine rounds up the number of periods and there is no way to prevent it. This is also stated in the manual. Lest someone is tempted to call this a feature, consider that the ""feature"" has been removed from more recent financial calculators (thus solving for 'n' on the 17BII correctly displays the fractional part whenever appropriate). Also, the construction is somewhat sloppy; on my sample the keys rattles when the calculator is shaken and the Enter key is labeled slightly off-center.Doubtless, the HP 12C makes a powerful fashion statement on everyone's desk, next to that typewriter and rotary phone. Those who value substance over style, however, should look elsewhere."
1,Poor quality,"I recently purchased a new 12C hoping that the poor quality reported in other reviews was not true. Unfortunately it was. My new 12C had several keys that were soft to the touch instead of having a firm click and several had to be pressed just right for the keystroke to registers. We own two 80's era 12C's which are wonderful. The only reason now to buy a 12C is nostalgia, otherwise the HP 30b is a wonderful, high quality financial calculator that does what the 12C does and more."
5,Best on the market,"As a retired banker, I have used this product for over 20 years. It is invaluable for financial calculations. It does a many different types of financial calculations from present value to calculating yields for payment streams. If you are buying or leasing a car or any other item this calculator can tell you what interest rate you are paying. I have it with me most all time and have found it extremely reliable over the years."
4,The old financial workhorse,"The HP-12c is the financial calculator that has been around a long time for a reason...it does what finance people need it to do. It takes some time to get comfortable with the keystroke logic, but the HP-12c is capable of very sophisticated calculations. Even with today's interactive software and internet access to calculations, it's good to have this as a standby."
4,Nice Financial Calculator,"The calculator responds well, and it holds firmly in my hands. It is easy to see why this calculator has endured over the years."
3,Very interesting,"Although this is not exactly what I expected, I am learning a lot, especially about textiles and the history of them. Well written and easy to understand.Willie Bodrak"
2,"Its good, if you don't like Blink 182.","This documentary features no music by Blink 182, no direct interviews with them, but it does feature an interview with some guy who worked at a pizza place with Mark in high school.I suggest, buy an authorized one, like the Urethra Chronicles, because I and II are both really good."
3,Blink 182,"This is a 3rd party documentary about Blink 182 as a band and their rise to fame. The DVD cannot play any blink 182 music, so throughout the whole thing they are playing music from other bands. The interviews were really informative."
4,kinda cool,"this is a really cool biography on blink 182. its from england. it has a trivia quiz and a discography. it features interviews with the band and friends and family. its more acurat than maximum blink 182. the reason why i gave it 4stars instead of 5 is because on the trivia quiz the first question is ""in what video does the band parade around naked? a. whats my age again b. adams song c. all the small things or d. dammit?"" and ofcourse as we all know the answer is whats my age again. so i chose whats my age again and what do they tell me ""WRONG!!!"". so i press it again ""WRONG!!!"" ok lets try all the small things. ""CORRECT!!!"". that is completely wrong if you ask me. i was like ""what the hell?""! well anyway i think any blink fan should have this because everything else is correct! :-)"
2,so so,"This thing vibrates way too loud and it bothers my hands holding it. I like my remington much better but can't find a new 1/8 "" guide comb for it."
3,Disappointed,"The dryer is great, but the plug burned out within 2 months. For the money, I would have expected it to be made better and last longer than that!!"
2,DONT BUY,I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THIS BUT I WAS SADLY DICAPOINTED. I THOUGHT ALL IMAX MUST BE GOOD BUT IT WASNT. BIG LET DOWN.
5,Surprisingly gorgeous and high quality,"I got this DVD on a sale where it was marked down to about $5.00. I didn't expect it to be high quality. I was pleasantly surprised. I've watched wildlife films and read wildlife pubs for nearly 40 years and rarely have I seen such beautiful cinematography. One reviewer panned this film and it was an unwarranted critique in my view. There was plenty of information, eye-popping photography, and no preachy tone. If I'd have paid $30, I would have felt it was well-spent.Whenever I hear someone complain about a nature/wildlife film being too preachy, it makes me wonder if they're not fans of nature to begin with or if they're hunters. One cannot praise or preach enough about the beauty of nature and the need to preserve it. This film merely informs and captures the majestic beauty of a species and its territory."
2,Not impressed!,The best thing about this DVD is the cover. It had terrible graphics and general info. I was looking forward to leaning something new about bears and was given a docum. largely on N. American bears.
4,its a jersey,"It was everything that I expected it to be. Too bad he got injured the week after I bought it. I'm 5'11', 200 lbs and bought a large and it fits fine!"
4,Magician of the Modern: Chick Austin and the Transformation of the Arts of America,"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in the Arts and how American taste evolved toward the modern. Chick Austin was a gutsy man with great insight. It was especially interesting to read about his personal life. I loved reading about his quirky, nifty house in Hartford. Anyone with some life experience, who has been around the block a few times, can appreciate what his life was like. Well done."
4,Give The Man A Break,"TO the reader from Alamosa, Co, I don't believe that you have read either of his books. You continue to write the same chatter in each of your reviews about him not observing the Sabbath, but I don't see you attacking the other sports figures/authors with the same accusation. He is not the only Christian who played ball on the Sabbath. And for you to know it, you must have been watching him play on the Sabbath, huh? I believe that if you would read his books with an open mind instead of a mind full of bias, you would actually learn something. It's your comments that are a bunch of blather. Please, give the man a break, and give us one too. We want to see serious readers give reviews, not some vindictive coward who won't even sign his name."
1,Reggie White Is a Sabbath-Breaker!,"I couldn't believe the sanctimonious blather in this book. Reggie White is so biblically illiterate he apparently has never understood the Ten Commandments.If you want advice from a hypocritical pop-culture phenom who opted for fame and fortune by routinely breaking the Sabbath, this book is for you. If you're looking for advice from a truly Christian role model, look elsewhere."
3,A good book for informed wiccans,The book of spells was a good book with a few exceptions. Some of the spells DID actually work but there were some that i didn't seem to see any results. This is the third spell book i purchased and it was rated sencond best in my collection.(Even though my collection isn't that big!) I don't think i could whole-heartedly suggest this to an experianced wiccan but maybe to a biginner.
2,just plain goofy,"Maybe, this tape is worth around 5 bucks (with free shipping). I am constanly trying to improve my ""game"" and thought that this cassette would enhance my skills further. WRONG I was! This tape is borderline goofy as hell. I found myself listening to the people ""picking up"" women, and at the same time, just thinking how pathetic these encounters were. The lines used are lame. These guys would get eaten alive in a big city club scene. Also, some of the dialogue doesn't sound like it would fly in the 21st Century. Alas, this audiotape may be appropriate for the literal ""beginner"" on the scene. Other than that, I would not recommend it for anyone who has a shred of confidence with women."
3,It's just ok,"A lot of historical inaccuracies mixed with some accurate information. From the beginning where they show the death of Jefferson it's entirely inaccurate as Jefferson is in an unknown room with just 1 other person while he passes, the room is not Jefferson's at Monticello. Later they show British Soldiers marching on Monticello, and they show a monocular with the current Monticello in it, Monticello wasn't built until after the revolution(in it's present form). They also make it a fact that Jefferson fathered children with Sally Hemmings, when the DNA evidence only shows that a Jefferson did, which was more than likely his brother who was around the slaves more than Thomas was. They also compare him to modern GOP, you can't compare any of the founders to any modern party and there are few similarities.Overall it's entertaining, and does touch on a few new subjects, just be cautious that there are some inaccuracies. I was looking for something different."
4,A very good movie!,I had semi low expectations for this movie but in the end the movie turned out to be great. Robert D proves again why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. This was a true story as well which makes it a even better watch.
3,Another predictable product from Hollywood assembly line...,"I'm fed up with the generic,predictable storylines of films like ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Men of Honor"". Here is the basic formula:1) Humble, poor character starts out with incredible odds against him/her 2) Main character encounters WAY OVERDONE HOOLYWOOD-IZED EVIL bad guys who attempt to thwart success 3) 100% of these attempts by EVIL villains fail 4) Main character gets close to success 5) EVIL villain steps in for final blow 6) Main character prevails 7) Everything is gift-wrapped up in box with a beautiful bow and final scene contains all characters smiling and singing..give me a break. How many of these predictable, overdone films is Hollywood going to produce. Don't you people ever get tired of them as I have? I should have known, but I thought this one might have been different"
3,Over the top romanticism,"How many crescendos of emotion can one tolerate? Try this movie. It tries way to hard to pull on heart strings, and does little to really illuminate the subject. Hollywood fluff."
2,Not terribly inspiring,"I'm possibly a bit jaded, but in much the same way I'd recommend The Fugitive over US Marshals, I'd recommend A Few Good Men over the recent Men of Honor or Rules of Engagement. It's simply more of the same, and not nearly as driven."
2,Tries too hard,"This movie tried too hard to be inspirational. I like a movie where the inspiration creeps up on you, instead of getting shoved in your face.At times it was slower than slow, and I just wished they'd get on with the movie. I'm not too big a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., and although his acting was okay, he didn't help make the movie any better for me."
4,Great acting and very satisfying true story,"Gooding and De Niro both gave outstanding performances in this true story of one determined man's fight to become the first African-American Navy diver. De Niro plays ""Billy Sunday,"" an unsavory, basically unlikeable character whose racism only serves to strengthen the resolve of Carl Brashear (Gooding). As time goes by, even De Niro grows to admire Brasheir's character and strength of will. Brashear faces innumerable obstacles. De Niro eventually becomes his champion, assisting his efforts. It is a great true story. The terrible racism of the past is still a disgrace to our society, and we all know that for every successful ""Brashear"" there were countless worthy but not so fortunate black aspirants in the service who were kept down because of their race. It's a happy story with a positive message...I hope many, many young people will see it."
5,Men Of Honor Review,"This movie is a masterpeice. It's very powerful, and realistic. This movie shows how segragetion made ones man's life a living hell when he tried to join the Navy. Robert Deniro is wonderful. He portrays his character of Master Chief Billy Sunday perfectly, and Cuba Gooding Jr. does an equally amazing job of playing the only colored sailor trying to become a diver. I suggest you rent this movie, you won't regret it."
1,Honorably Courageous,"Has everything: a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special. It makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes, especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board, winning their applaud as well. This is a don't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout...20 star performances! Thank you for sending me a copy. - Q"
3,A brave film !,"Based on a true story , the film is a real challenge whose principal message is to face the life with all its obstacles, prejuices , evilness , injustice and cruelty . You have to fight and trust in yourself no matter what .Cuba Gooding Jr has played the most prominent role to date in his raising career as Carl Brashear.He will have to face the painful racism subject since he enlists to the Navy . And the search of the honor will be the real motive for his continous improvement .Robert de Niro looks a bit overacted and his facial expression reminds too much to Al Capone in the Untouchables .High raising situations and good special effects through the film and since the movie lacks of dramatic punch and gives too many concesions to the great audience , retains however the interest .Watchable work."
2,Another Hollywood treatment of a true life story...,"Everytime hollywood comes up with a biopic it makes me worry... The main character is always portrayed as an angel. It is always portrayed very black and white. ""Men of Honor"" is the best example of the hollywood treatment since Tina Turner's true life story hit the big screen in ""What's love got to do with it"" in 1993. I wish they would portray these peoples life in a more realistic way. It would make it so much more interesting. 2 stars because De Niro and Gooding Jr. give great performances..."
5,Great movie!,"I never know if they arrived on time. They arrive, I watch them. Shrug? This item was as advertised and in the correct aspect ratio. OAR is the most important thing for me when ordering old movies. If you want good service - goHastings!"
1,What a load of rubbish!,"I have read the reviews on this site and cannot believe they are talking about the movie I saw--yes,MEN OF HONOR. A cliche ridden, unintentionally comic, and hackneyed piece of work. The film is also an insult to the real Carl Brashear. A great story has been turned into a piece of overblown hollywood pap. The only redeeming feature is Cuba Gooding Jnrs performance. As a long standing admirer of Robert DeNiro I can only say this is arguably his worst performance--he even uses his CAPE FEAR accent. The film is filled with stock (and underdeveloped) characters and situations. This film is mainstream filmmaking at its most lamentable. It's as if film narrative has stood still for 35 years. Please avoid this dross at all costs. Im just waiting for the comic spoof to come out with Leslie Nielsen."
2,Oh What Could Have Been,"Carl Brashear is a true American Hero. After watching this movie, I was so inspired that I took it upon myself to do a little research. As much as it is an unbelievable accomplishment for Mr. Brashear to have overcome extreme obstacles (starting with racism and leading to amputation of his leg), the disappointment lies once again in Hollywood's need to sensationalize rather than tell it like it is.If I wanted a inspirational movie based on fiction, I would have rented the Karate Kid I through IV (wax on, wax off Danielson),The Best of the Best (Do it!!), Over the Top (Lincoln Hawk) or not to forget Cole Trickle's inspiring portrayal in Days of Thunder (oops I meant Tom Cruise as Cole Trickle).In all seriousness, Mr. Brashear is a true American Hero and I look forward to sharing his real life story with my three sons. Remember, a son never forgets. My sons will never forget the true heroism of Mr. Brashear. They do not need Hollywood to appreciate his efforts."
4,Honored to watch,"Men of Honor is one of those special movies that truly inspires you. Anytime a movie focuses on a heroic story of one man or woman's life, it's bound to be inspirational and a joy to watch.Men of Honor was both of these. I give an A+ for the story itself, but there were problems with the technical side of the movie.First, the acting. I have never really thought Cuba Gooding Jr. was that great of an actor. And this movie hammers that thought into my head even deeper. His facial expressions and the such are OK, but sometimes his words just don't sound right. He was the only actor in the movie that I had a problem with though.The directing was good, except it just seems the movie jumped around a lot. It moved too fast at times. But really that wasn't too much of a hindrance to the overall movie.Men of Honor was a great film that hasn't gotten the recognition it surely deserves. 4 Stars"
3,"Not wonderful, but definately worth your time.","When I first got my DVD player one of the first DVD's I ever took the pleasure of wathcing was Men of Honor, which I did not see in theatres. The movie had its sappy scenes that sort of made me roll my eyes because they where stamped with the HOLLYWOOD seal of sappiness. That did not ruin this movie though. I thought Brashear's romantic life was definately a great side-plot to this movie and it sort of was a good breath of fresh air from all the hard-**s Navy stuff. I do respect Carl Brashear for what he did (even if the movie may have exaggerated it, I don know if it did or not) by watching this film. He was another brave African American that broke down racial barriers. This move is really pretty good, and every slacker in the United Staes should be forced to see it. :)"
4,MEN OF HONOR IS SUPERB!,"Even though at times, Men of Honor was a little too melo-drama for my taste, Cuba Gooding Jr. is wonderful as Carl Brashear in this spectacular film starring opposite Robert DeNiro in one of a great performance (as usual)! A breathtaking film that is destined for the OSCARS! Not to be missed!"
3,"Good, but nothing new","This is a good bio and De Niro and Gooding, Jr. are fine in their roles, but there just isn't anything new here. If you know nothing about Brashear - after the first 15 minutes of this film, you will be able to develop a remarkably accurate scenario for the rest of the film. Enjoyable, but directed with such predictability that that the sentiment seems overblown and the man's accomplishments seem diminished. Too bad - because the real man was probably mighty inspiring."
3,Could have been better!,"I agree with Jeff Shannon's review, if this didn't have so much adult language it would have been a great and inspiring film (even with the cliches). But we're left with an R rated film that lot's of kids will miss out on simply because of the language! Superb performances by both actor's though!!!"
3,Valiant Acting Despite Lackluster Writing and Direction,"I can't fault Robert DeNiro or Cuba Gooding, Jr. As usual, they give a film everything they've got. But there's only so far actors can take a film on their own when they are working with C- material. This is a labored, plodding, sentimental look at a Navy instructor (DeNiro), who is a terrible bigot, decades ago. He gets the first black man in his diving course and is expected to fail him. The man (Gooding) is so earnest, hardworking and so ""Navy"" that DeNiro begins to be troubled by his proposed course of action. Every cliche scene that has been used in the movies is trotted out here and I am going to avoid seeing any more of director George Tillman, Jr.'s films as a result. One wonders with all of the clout DeNiro has in the film industry why he took this poor a vehicle for his talent."
4,A Moving and Inspirational Film,"You think you've had it tough? You should check out this film. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all.George Tillman in only his second major feature (after SOUL FOOD), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. Perhaps because he didn't write this one, MEN OF HONOR has a depth and texture missing in SOUL FOOD.Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. It is a role well-suited for him. His career would be better served by playing more roles like this one, instead of the silly comedies he's most often cast in.De Niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains Brashear. The supporting characters are also fine.If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to check out this one."
5,"This film is great, no matter what a dumb critic says!","This heartwarming drama is and extrodinary film with extremely great acting as well as cinimatography. I would put this wonderful drama in at least the top 20 greatest movies of all time, believe me this is a truly outstanding piece of work and I would recomend it to any one, with a heart."
5,great art work,"My kids (6,5 and 3) all love this puzzle. We all enjoy the art work on the letters being different than the normal examples ( Y has yarn, N has nuts). My daughter just leaves this puzzle out on her shelf because she likes to look at it. My 6 year old still likes it because it is not as babyish as most alphabet puzzles. We have had this puzzle for 5 years and have had no problems with wear and tear issues."
2,"The ""coating"" over the letters is peeling off...","I was surprised that this received such high praise (and glad I didn't pay the retail price). We bought this used but in new condition, and after a few months, the coating on several of the letters is starting to peel off. If you don't put the letters in just right, the corners catch, and I think that's what's causing the damage. At least one of the letters (maybe N for Noodle) jams if put in upside down. And is elbow macaroni really a ""noodle""? Not the worst toy out there, but not a five-star item, either."
3,"Title is misleading, but a good quick read nonetheless","I have always been intrigued by the work of the ""Zenmaster,"" which is why I first decided to read this book. I had heard about Jackson's work in mending the rift between Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and had wondered how he did it when others could not. The first 100 pages of this book delve into the mind of this phenomenal coach, but the rest of the book goes on to name his achievements. Yes, it was interesting to learn a little more about Michael Jordan, Pippen, Grant and Rodman but those guys were not the reason I picked up the book. If I wanted to learn about those players, I would have read ""The Jordan Rules."" Bottom line, I would rather pick up ""Sacred Hoops"" or ""Maverick"", which were actually written by Jackson himself."
4,A fun read but it is not all Phil,When i order this book i thought it would be more all about Phil Jackson. But this book lost its way somhow. Yes you get many things about Phil but this is so mutch about the Bulls and so many things that Phil has litle to do with and the book is so mutch talking about the same things over and over again.But the good:I love the NBA and to read about the Bulls in the 90s and the Lakers with Shaq and Kobe is great fun. I learn some new stuff about Phil(i have read two other books about him) and how he see the game. This is the greatest coach in the history of the game.If you want to know about Phil then this is just a okey book but if you want to learn about the 90s Bulls this is a great book.
2,Slick Design but lots of issues,"When I pulled this out of the box I was very impressed with the design. You're entire ipod is covered by the silicon shell and the screen with a hard plastic front.Unfortunately, that's where the good impressions stopped.Issues:1) Dust sticks like glue (but what did I expect with silicon)2) Hard plastic front is SHARP! Just holding it with my finger lightly against the round cutout, which allows you to use the click wheel, I neatly sliced my finger. By the time I had the thing on my Ipod I had 3 cuts. My husband could not believe that it was so sharp and so I took the cover off and had him put it back on. Within a minute he cut himself too. Ridiculous.3) Given that I can't fit the covered Ipod into my portable speaker set and it's such a pain to put on and remove I've put it on a shelf where it can happily gather dust while it awaits my yearly trip to donation box."
3,Wayyyyyyy to tight!,"great shorts, but much tighter fit than regular carhartts i have purchased in the past..better order 2 sizes larger. have had better luck with the rip-stop carhartts."
3,not your Chinese garden 101,This book briefly introduce the Chinese gardens of Suzhou as well as the origin of that pretty Chinese garden court at Metropolitan. There are many styles of Chinese gardening and Suzhou style is just one of them. This book Don't waste your money on this book.
4,Buddha Balm,"I purchased this product a few months ago and since then, bought 3 more flavours. I have recommended it to all my friends and they bought some too. This product is cruelty free, vegan and the flavours are divine! My friend can't get enough of the Chai flavour, whereas I prefer the Cherry Ginger and Coconut Lemongrass. The product protects your lips, is not overly greasy and the scent/flavour is great! I fully recommend Buddha Balm."
4,Realities of PR gives good insight,This book gives good insight into the PR field and makes good reading material
3,Good Book,"This book gives you a general view of public realtions that is good for those who are curious about the industry. However, I would read Michael Levine's Guerilla PR Wired to gain a more thorough view of Public Relations."
5,Salomon Shoes,"Purchased these shoes for a trip to the Amazon, Brazil last year. Great product; kept my feet dry during hikes in the jungle and on the boat."
3,A mixed bag,"I agree with most of the positive comments from other reviewers, but I have two beefs with this book. The vocabulary is a challenge for anyone with no background in statistics, and the explanations are sometimes so brief as to be frustrating. Here's an example of the first: ""Fortunately, many statistics that rely on the normal curve are sufficiently robust even to moderately large violations of their assumptions; that is, the results can be fairly close to what would be found if the distributions were close to the so-called normal."" As an example of the latter, the author has one descriptive paragraph on statistical power, defined as ""the ability to detect a true difference, measured on a scale from 0 to 1."" Paragraphs such as that one leave me wanting more.I think this book is better used as a supplement or as a review rather than as an introduction to statistics."
3,Pick a different edition,"The Inferno was an enjoyable read, but I would have gotten more out of the book by buying and edition with some translator's notes to accompany the text. I know almost nothing about either religion or 12th certury European history, and would have enjoyed an editor's explaination of Dante's allusions and references along the way."
1,Not a good set,"I bought the cd set before I left for Korea to teach English. It is not a very good set for learning Korean. Sure, it will give you some useful expressions, but a lot of the expressions I did not use in Korea (I was there for almost 3 years). The pronunciation was off, too. It was not accurate, at times, concerning words. When I said 'excuse me' as instructed by the set, my co-teacher laughed at me because it was the wrong word! I have studied languages before (Spanish, Japanese, French (degreed in French))and the Pimsleur set is not one that I would ever recommend."
2,Other languages better; Korean fails,"Own two other Pimsleur languages, and it's likely a statement more about the Korean language than Pimsleur, but this is no where as good as either Japanese or Spanish. Pronunciation is very difficult to understand, and lessons follow ""stock"" Pimsleur without additional explanation. For example, no explanation of how to pronounce the hybrid ""R-L"" sound; in Japanese lessons this was much easier to comprehend. Have listened to lesson 1 on three separate occasions and still cannot remember the first phrase, ""Do you speak English?"" For this specific language, Pimsleur Basic system fails to explain necessary details."
2,Not for someone who really wants to learn Korean,"this is good for someone (like a businessman) traveling to korea and needs to know a few key phrases. it doesn't really teach you many words and such, but mostly memorizing and repeating phrases. i don't really call this learning a language. it also doesn't have anything written down, so if you're a visual learner, this isn't for you as the entire thing is just on a CD."
3,SO SO Product,"I was disappointed with this produce; the nuggets are harder than I thought they would be. On the upside, however, I love the Old Mother Hubbard brand as a rule."
4,sad but true,"John hit on so many funny aspects of living in the north woods and working on vehicles. The humor stands the test of time. The fact is, winter and truck repair will indeed have you doing some soul serching."
2,The truck runs,"But the book sputters.I really do not see what all the rave reviews are about.If you enjoy reading about crankshafts, kingpins, cams and pistons, then this book is for you. I know some very good mechanics and am not demeaning the profession by any means.In fact, my '52 navy-blue GMC pickup has been running like a top for years thanks to them.I was anticipating something comparable to Michael Perry's ""Truck"", which was more engaging of everydaycharacterizations...with seasoning.Maybe a literary oil change and a shot of WD-40 might have given this read a smooth ride.Half way through the book I had to jump out the passenger side."
5,The best gift I've received in years...,"I received this cd for Christmas, and I absolutely love it. In fact, it has been playing most of the time since I got it! It creates a very soothing and relaxing atmosphere without being monotonous. I have different meditation cd's, but I have never heard spiritual sounds being used in such a creative and diverse way. Each track has a unique style. Wai Lana and Siddha both have very soft and touching voices that are also at times incredibly powerful. I find this cd has a deep, positive effect on my mood and attitude. I just ordered their other cd, Yoga-Music of the Heart, and can't wait to receive it. I hope it's asgreat as this one."
4,Repeat Buy...,"OK. I've used my current 20S for years. As a programmer, I can get most of what I want from the computer itself. But for things like HEX->DEC, DEC->HEX, etc conversions, this one has been great. When I first bought it, I was not too happy about not having RPN. However, when my wife wanted to do some calculations, the non-RPNness was perfect for her. It's been great for those incidental computations. Here's where it looses stars. About 5 months ago, the batteries died. I bought new ones at Radio Shack (possibly part of the problem...) and it worked great.. for about a month. I bought another set, it got me another month. It was at that point, I thought I'd find a better calculator. I tried to order the 32ii but I got too impatient for the 1-2 week wait that quickly doubled. I'm getting my second 20S now. It's just what I want."
5,An Enjoyable Read and Lots To Discover!,"Reading ""The Worthy Ones"" by Charlie Russell, I was filled with ""So, that's where that came from"" experiences. As his African-American characters go through their lives in Louisiana in the 1920's and '30's, I would hear echoes of the cool, hip language popular in New York City in the 1950's and early `60's among the sophisticated ""Beats"" of all colors.Russell tunes in on cultural history. His scenes trace customs, music, storytelling and languages in American life back to their rural southern Black origins brought up north by the mass migration during World War 11.I found ""The Worthy Ones"" a real eye-opener. I realized how much of our American culture today finds it's roots in African-American culture. The novel's language sings to you and the plot pulls you along into a warm and proud story of the survival of a family, a culture and a people."
5,"earthy Bahamian gospel music, inspiring","This music, recorded in the 1960's in an impromptu jam session, is earthy, soulful, and inspiring. The voices harmonize in an imperfect, yet hypnotizing, rhythmic, moving collage of sounds, bringing out a real human quality in music."
3,ho hum,"Piazza is consistantly a good player year after year. His backup band continues to grow but I don't think the same can be said for Rod. I think many Piazza fans would love to see recorded more adventerous harmonica such as in the song ""Devil Foot"". This CD is well recorded (except for two of the songs being out of pitch, which may nag those of us who like to play along)and an honest reflection of what Piazza sounds like live."
4,Large Wooden Map,We got this for our 6 year old grandson and he loves it and has already started learning capitals and where the states are. A very good learning tool.
4,A good start,"I would have liked more information to be included on the puzzle. Each piece is cut out in the shape of the state and has the state capital printed underneath. I think they could have taken this a step further adding key information about that state such as it's nickname, state flower or other educational information. It is a good way to get very young children to learn their state capitals and the shape and geography of the U.S."
4,USA Wooden Puzzle,"My 79 year old father has dementia and is in a nursing home. I bought this puzzle to help his memory and hand/eye co-ordination. He and my mother traveled alot and when we work with the puzzle, he can remember some of the places that they visited. He can recall many adventures and this helps keep his mind active. Many of the other residents also enjoy talking about their travels. Most of the pieces are large enough for them to handle and because they are made of wood, they don't bend or get lost. Thank you."
5,"Love, Love, Love it","My 3 year old daughters LOVE this puzzle, although it wasn't intended for them! It drove me crazy for the first several days because I had to stop what I was doing to help them. After just a week, both of them know MANY of the state names enough to say ""It's by Florida"" and they can find the state. The outline on the wood board is perfect for comparing, yet still makes it challenging because the pieces can still move around... so little fingers have to learn to be careful! Seriously a great ""toy"". And I am thrilled with many of Melissa and Doug things. They are always top quality, especially the puzzles!"
5,Good learning puzzle,"I ordered this U.S. puzzle to keep at my house to use when my five grandchildren come over. We work on a few of the states each time they come. It's nice because under each piece is the capitol of the state so it can be used to learn those or just the state locations. I have found it quite useful, and the kids look forward to our little ""game""."
3,jigsaw puzzle of the usa,"needs something sticky so the puzzle can be put away without losinging pieces, either a bag or some velcro or other stickly stuff. Otherwise the puzzle is wonderful."
4,What a funny movie!,"Jamie Lee Curtis was so believable as the daughter! It was just a really good, very funny movie!"
5,Look on through to the other side,"In this remake starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, a mother and a daughter wind up switching bodies and a wish is made at a Chinese diner. Throughout the movie the mother and daughter learn to see through the others eyes and thereby understand each other better. I did enjoy it very much. I thought both Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis did very well in this film but I also enjoyed the work that Christina Vidal put into this movie as well. I would recommend this film. Pretty good for a remake, and easier to relate to."
3,Good movie for fun.,"This movie is one of the best that Lindsay Lohan made, and is a fun adventure that is very fast and hectic. Lohan's Anna seems like a caricature of an indulgent, impossible teen, unless you actually have a teen of your own, that is, and have to survive every day with a tantrum that couldn't touch a 2-year-old's! If you really liked the original Freaky Friday movie with Jodie Foster, this is a very different movie, and you probably won't like this one, but if you are looking for a way to spend a couple of light-hearted hours laughing, this movie is great, and Jamie Lee Curtis is really great in this, although Mark Harmon is very stiff and plays a mannequin."
5,Much better than I thought it would be....,"This movie is a really great family film! I was surprised at how well Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis worked together. The chemistry between them really made the movie...and of course the line ""I look like the Cryptkeeper!"" is an instant classic! A definite must-see!"
3,Actually very average--or what used to be average!,"I think that the reason that this film got as good a reception as it did was because of the generally lousy films that came out in the summer of 2003. It stood out a bit because it wasn't completely stupid and it wasn't trying to be the ""ultimate"" anything (and failing!) like most of the other films that summer. It was decently paced, it was quite well acted, and based on a familiar premise. I was your basic ""B"" movie. But nothing to write home about. The script only made the audience that I saw it with laugh out loud twice. An amusing film, not a yuk-fest, by a long shot. But still watchable--which is more than can be said about most of the films that came out in 2003!! For what it's worth Jamie Lee Curtis did deliver the best ""teen-ager stuck in an adult's body"" that I have seen in films."
3,Is it really that freaky?,"Freaky Friday was a sort of freaky movie, hence the title. I mean, it was about a teenage spoiled brat girl who constantly argued with her mom when she didn't get her way, so when they were argueing in a chinese resturant, they got magic forturne cookies that changed them into each other until they had self-less love for each other. Isn't that sweet. It is a Disney movie, remember that, but it really wasn't as bad as the plot makes it sound. When I went to see it I figured I could at least make fun of it if it was really bad, but I couldn't really do that because it wasn't as bad as I expected. There weren't any big special effects or anything like that, but it was fun. I wouldn't reccomend you run out and see it just because, but if you have nothing better to do, it can't really hurt, but make sure you've already seen Pirates of the Caribbean if you want to see a Disney movie."
1,Not for my,This movie is totally a junk i recomend more the original version who is more better than thisPD:One the worst remake i ever seen
1,Dumb plot,"This movie has nothing going for it at all. It is not funny, dramatic, action, it just has nothing. Tries to be funny and the plot has been used many times before. The ending wasn't good and neither was any part of this movie. My favorite part of this movie was the credits because then I got to leave."
1,Never got item,Never received item. Contacted them and they never responded back. Ended up getting a refund from amazon.
3,weird,"this is a good decent movie that is weird and has your head spinning in, and by the way its time for curtis to retire"
5,excellent,Great Job! Freaky Friday is the best movie ever! I encourage you to watch if you have not already done so! Jamie Lee Curtis and Linsday Lohan are the best ever! I love you guys!
1,great actresses lousy film,"While I certainly agree that there is alot of talent involved on both parts I must say nothing beats a classic. I admit I didn't watch the whole thing. This is because I found the Charictors wholly unappealing. Anna Acted like a spoiled self centered brat! I really couldn't sympathise with her at all. In some ways I am & some ways not a very advantaged child. I was always given what I needed & a fair amount of what I wanted. If I wanted more I had to earn it. She expected everything to be just handed to her, get real kid!I grew up with and loved the old Jodi foster movie the jokes where clean yet hillarious. The comedy timeless & most of all you could really sympathise with the charictors & love them. I love a good disney movie but I think that this was one where they should have left well enough alone & concintrated Lindsy Lohans abundant talent on an original piece."
3,The Kobayashi Report,"This is a pretty good movie. But I don't really think it is that great. I don't have it anymore, and I don't think I would get another one at all."
5,you must see this one,hello lindsay fansthis movie is realy verry COOOOOOOOL YOU MUST SEE THIS ONEi love itgreeting from the netherlandsgerben van den bosch
3,"Nothing Great, but it's still worth seeing!","Freaky Friday was a sort of freaky movie, hence the title.

I wouldn't reccomend you run out and see it just because, but if you have nothing better to do, it can't really hurt, but make sure you've already seen Pirates of the Caribbean if you want to see a Disney movie."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"For a movie based on a mom and daughter switching bodies, this was very entertaining for the whole family. It was enjoyable to see the mother going to high school in her daughter's body, just as it was hilarious to watch the daughter counsel people while in her mother's body.The events that occur and the script provide for many laughs. Of course, you can't expect it all to be realistic, due to the premise, but once over that, it is funny throughout.The mother and daughter both learn their lessons after walking in the other's shoes.this is a good wholesome fun-filled movie that parents, teens and young children can all watch together."
4,THIS MOVIE IS SOOO COOL!!!,"ok i really like this movie it totally rocks! ok ok so its not the best! but sometimes its fun to go to the theater and get popcorn and soda and just HAVE FUN!!!its like about this teenager and shes in a garage band and her moms a therapist, and she has this totally annoying (ive been there) little brother, and she and her mom get this fortune cookie that makes them change bodies so suddenly shes her mom whos supposed to get married like the next day and talk to all these people cause shes a therapist, and then she (the teenager) is supposed to audition for their band and she has this math test in school, and the only way they can change back is by being selfless, and its just a blast to watch it! plus the music rocks, its great! i totally reccomend this movie to anybody! go see it! youll like it!!!"
3,It was good but I've seen and read better,It was funny but I've seen it beforeHer brother (Ape Face) is a pain I have two younger brothers and they're evil so I know how Lindsay Lohan feels. This story about a daughter and a mother switching places this is the funniest story ever and how do they switch places just by a fortune cookie? The book was amazing as was the movie. The movie was very good but not my type of movie I'm more of a action/horror type of guy. I think movies from books ruin what the autor writes in his/her books then everybody just goes to see the movie instead of reading the book first. But all in all it was a pretty good book that everyone of every age I think would enjoy to read and see the movie.
5,problems?,"I really like this movie! It is one of the best movies I ever seen. I think the plot is really creative which brings out meaningful insights. In addition to that, it also points a problem between parents and teenagers which is lack of understanding. Through the switch, Tess Coleman and Anna better understand each other such as their problems, difficulties, pressure so on and so forth. Anna realized her mother's life isn't that perfect after all while Tess Coleman understands her daughter's problems at school such as the conflict with the history teacher and the constant detention. They both change a lot through the movie. At the end, they know how to get along with each other. I really like the ending! I think this movie is really engaging, Lindsay Lohan has done a great job acting out Anna! Overall, the movie is really hilarious!"
3,fun movie...good to watch on a weekend evening,"Freaky friday is a movie which you can watch it on a weekend with your family and friends.it has loads of fun...and the performance by the lead actors is convincingly good.and the best part is the movie has a message,which is very nice.its a sweet nice film.over all its a light-hearted comedy movie you can watch on a fun evening.we had a goodtime watching this movie."
1,Please Don't Watch,"If you have been looking to watch this movie, I'll save you the trouble of going through a complete horror! This is the WORST movie I've seen. The plot is very bad. Too bad that those great actors had to be wasted on this. Also, Freaky Friday doesn't deserve deserve the music that plays in it. This plot could've worked, if in the plot, there weren't so many monkey events! If you're interested in watching a supernatural comedy, please try Back to the Future or some other classic like that. Don't go so far to watch this movie at all!"
1,crappiest of the crap,"this movie really sucked. It was so bad, that it actually slowed down time to make viewing it all the more painfull. it is your typical disney movie, with all their little crappy disney one liners and thier stupid disney lesson to be learned at the end. Add in a horrible band of one of the main characters and you have grade A crap."
3,Not the original,i don; like this movie because its not the original and it copied the other one with shelly long.its not as good as the original.
4,fun remake of a Disney classic,"When a mother and daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan) are observed arguing with each other, a woman gives them magic fortune cookies that switch them into each other's bodies. Actors Curtis and Lohan must then play as if they were the other person trapped in their body, and they both do a fine job.This updated version of the Jodie Foster vehicle works on all fronts -- the two main actors do a great job with their switched personalities, the supporting cast is very good, the script is funny and the situations are entertaining.DVD extras include a backstage pass with actor Lindsay Lohan, 1 deleted scene, 2 alternate endings, a few bloopers and 2 music videos.Good family film."
4,"Good, But Some Things Could Be Taken Out For Little Kids","I think that Freaky Friday was a pretty good movie, except for some parts that they could have left out. You know, the stuff that ""supposably"" makes the movie ""funny"", but doesn't. Some things aren't good for kids under the age of 9 or so, which stands to reason that it's rated PG. If you have kids older than 9, this is a good movie. It is about a girl and a mother switching bodys. It is pretty funny, and you will probably enjoy it! Go for it! I hope this review was helpful!"
4,Good,"This movie was funny, sad, and interesting all at the same time. It could touch so many audiences. It really explored the mother-daughter relationship, which so many women have a problem with. It was a sweet movie, and I really liked it. The mother and the daughter, no matter how different they were, ended up loving each other."
5,Lohan shines,"This movie was completely hilarious and a total shock to me. I wasn't going to give it a chance because I don't usually like ""teen"" movies but Lindsay Lohan has proven to me that she is a genuine actress. The reason I watched it because I love Jamie Lee Curtis but it was Lindsay who stole the show for me (though Curtis played a very significant, funny role). Most of you know the storyline, the two get switched and have to play in each other's lives for a day. It's actually really funny, don't throw the opportunity away like I was going to. Lohan is one of the only teen actresses who stands a chance because she can actually act and she's gorgeous as hell. 'Freaky Friday' is a must see for anybody."
4,Fast-paced laughs and drama,"Freaky Friday is a remake of the original Disney flick that starred Jodie Foster in the role now played by Lindsay Lohan. This is a warm-hearted comedy updated for the year 2003. Upon switching bodies mother and daughter are forced to appreciate each other's point of view and to selflessly help one another make it through the hectic day created by the spell of the Chinese fortune cookie. Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis are charismatic in their roles, and the supporting cast, including Mark Harmon as step-dad to be all fill their roles smoothly. This movie is engaging for all ages and delivers what you expect from this remake of a fine classic."
4,Jamie Lee rocks!,This movie was so hilarious! Jamile Lee Curtis was totally hilarious playing her daughter's character when their bodies got mystically switched. The best was her making fun of her son had me rolling. Great fun!
4,Well worth the time,"Maybe Robert Larson needs to lighten up, this is a feel-good, funny film, thoroughly enjoyable (and I am a skeptic on the quality of films these days) but was not dissppointed at all, there were a lot of cute, subtle little funny moments as well as the obvious stuff you'd expect... and the music was great. Really cute, I'm ging to see the 1976 version now!"
5,Great Purchase,I liked this movie and had a great experience in my purchase. I would highly recommend!
4,Freaky Friday Review,I liked this movie and Jamie Lee is great. I do not prefer it over the old version of the movie but my teenage daughter does of course!! There are some similarities to the old movie but not many. It is funny and pretty clean.
5,AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT!,"I waited for a long time for it's DVD's release and then i finally i saw it yesterday. And the movie is as good as i thought. I haven't seen the old FREAKY FRIDAY so i don't know how much the movies are alike except for the name. But i must say that the movie contains some shadows of ""THE HOT CHICK"". This movie covers two main characters Tess (Curtis) and Annabel (Lindsay Lohan). Who are always arguing with each other, simultaneously wish they could be someone else, they somehow exchange bodies, as they both learn what it's like to be in the other person's situation. As far as the acting concern Curtis and Lohan both did very well and it is very hard to judge who is better among the both. It is a family movie. I recommended it for all ages who love to watch fun."
4,Nice,Freaky Friday is a funny remake of the 70s version. It is family friendly and it was listed for a good price.
3,For A Friend,I have seen this movie many times and this was bought for a friend who likes this movie. Very good price and fast shipping....
4,Lindsay Lohan was Great!,Lindsay Lohan was great and Jamie Lee Curtis was great to. both had a hard roll to play they did great.
3,"Does thought control work if it is ""benign""?","Let an anthropologist walk around freely in a high-tech company, studying what people say to each other and why, and you get ""ethnography of corporate culture"". I suppose the reason companies allow (or even invite) this kind of study is to see if their attempts to mold corporate culture for better productivity really work.Simple answer: no, it doesn't. You can try to manage culture, and control people's thoughts and reactions, but if you do it strongly enough to have an effect, people will notice. It can create cynicism as well as emotional conflict as people try to reconcile membership in the company culture with their feelings of being manipulated. Kunda is thorough, and honest -- transparently describing his own methods in an epilogue chapter.I gave it a 3 only because I found it a long read to read about someone else's corporate culture. Better, perhaps, to take time here and there to think about our own."
2,This book doesn't cover the steps needed to burn DVD's.,"I do video production for a living. I am in the process of upgrading my business/equipment to include the ability to burn DVD's for my clients. This book didn't teach me the steps to accomplish this goal. This book was very general covering video production generalities, case studies, lots of technical jargon. I have a degree in television production, and the technical jargon in this book was WAY over my head. It did suggested some different DVD authoring programs for both a PC and MAC. Chapter 17 was the only chapter that really somewhat covered the differences in DVD-, DVD+, DVD+RW, DVD-RW, DVD-Rom, etc. But most of that chapter was hard to understand with technical terms that weren't really explained. I guess you could go thru the glossary and try to decifer the meanings, but I'd recommend looking for a different book. Out of the 304 pages, I found maybe 30 pages that were useful to me. I think I need one of those books for ""dummies""."
1,Worst DVD EVER!,"this DVD sucks...more boring than a junior college english course...i didn't learn a thing from it. but then again, i didn't learn a thing from syd's courses either. If he's such a great screenwriting teacher, how come he's not out writing oscar winning scripts....you know the saying, ""those who can't, teach."""
5,good ... but not the best of all,"I like this song . and this single too . it's very good for collector . but , it not excellent of all the maxi-single1. live version2. mother live remix3. Mum's rap"
5,Wonderful Glasses,"These glasses are so fun to use. They are lighweight and barely pass through any heat or cold. They feel so good in the hand when holding them. The drinking edges are very smooth and comfortable on the lips. Ice cold or steaming hot, be aware that your fingers will not warn you."
5,See your Espresso!,"I bought these glasses for my husband, who absoultly loves coffee! These are perfect, you can see the color of the coffee when it is poured and when using the larger size (7oz) that we also purchased, when he adds the froth, it is very cool."
4,Attractive Addition,"I purchased these glasses for an elderly relative who developed sensitivity to temperatures. These glasses maintain the perfect temperature, hot or cold, while remaining neutral to the touch. they are comfortable to hold and make an attractive addition to any table or setting. The only drawback to these lovely glasses is that they are delicate and care must be taken when washing not to damage them. However, unlike acrylic insulated mugs and cups, these are remarkably scratch resistant and look elegant even at a formal table setting."
2,Poor Eruption Footage,"I was really disapointed, for the price you pay you sure do not get much footage of the Eruption. I live in Seattle and was hoping to learn a lot about the Eruption and honestly didnt learn a single thing. Eruption footage only lasts maybe 1 minute of the entire movie."
2,A mixed bag,"A mix of decent photography and before (1980) and after (1990) snippets, but overall, not very impressive. No character studies of those affected are included, and certain aerial shots seem to be repeated throughout. Although it was originally shown on IMAX, clearly much of the photography was not shot with IMAX cameras. The CD cover says ""Academy Award nominee for best short documentary"" - that was apparently a very slow year for documentaries..."
4,Satirical View of Hollywood,"A film maker (Kevin Bacon) wins the grand prize for his student film, and then finds himself on the Hollywood ""fast track."" Increasingly, he is asked to sublimate his creative integrity, and is forced to choose between commercial success and his independence. This is a very amusing satire about the ""sharks"" of Hollywood versus an ""innocent"" struggling to maintain his autonomy. The supporting cast includes Eliot Gould, Martin Short, Roddy McDowall, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Eddie Albert. This film is a must see for people interested in the film industry. If you liked ""The Player,"" you'll love this film."
2,Humanities Interpreted through Philosophy,"This is an introduction to classical humanities figureheads with a philosophical twist.***Author L. James Hammond became intrigued with philosophy while still a teen. Research and academic skills learned at Harvard allowed Hammond to compile a series of articles on various topics such as philosophy, religion, ethics, literature, politics, physics, and etc. First published in China, the material reflects the author's philosophical view of how figures in classical humanities impacted today's society. The miscellanea index and citations included throughout these articles will encourage adventurist readers who wish to go beyond this superficial introduction to read more works that are classical."
5,Wish I could keep a journal like Ms. Sarton can,"I've read all of May Sarton's journals and whole-heatedly recommend them all. They are wonderful accounts of her life, her times, her joys and her struggles. And since she makes them so accessible, she speaks to each of us as we face similiar situations."
5,great phone for visually impaired,Bought this for my grandmother who was having problems with her eyesight. She loved the phone and appreciated the large buttons. We've never had a problem with it. Great phone for the price!
1,Do Not BUY a NWB phone,Even though I do not own this particular phone I did buy a NWB phone after having my orginal phone for 40 years. It lasted 5 months. You can not get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mails. I had to buy another AT&T phone so BEWARE ON BUYIBG THIS BRAND!
1,pantera lighning shirt,"when i got this shirt i was happy, cause it is one sick looking shirt.two weeks later, today, and i am very dissappointed. the material is very thin, and it rips very easily. there is a fat hole under my right armpit. this shirt is cheap. DONT BUY IT"
2,Not like pictured,"Although it's a construction themed wooden puzzle, I have received a puzzle different from the picture showed on Amazon. Very disapointing, so I give only 2 stars."
2,Not the Picture I Paid For,I don't know who's responsible for matching the picture with the product but this is not the picture I paid for. I like to collect jigsaw puzzles for my children and the picture has everything to do with my decision to buy it. My son was looking forward to getting the construction puzzle with the blue excavator. Instead we received a cartoon-like picture with a yellow excavator. So it was a great disappointment to receive a different picture than the site page promised. Something needs to be done about this deception.
2,Did not receive the pictured puzzle,"Although my 3 year old still enjoys this puzzle, it is not the one pictured. He was looking forward to a puzzle that has a prominent blue excavator and ended up with a puzzle that has a yellow excavator in the back. He'll get over it but is it really so difficult to have an accurate photo of the puzzle a shopper is purchasing?"
4,A strong OO philosophy,"This book certainly delivers its purpose. It provides explanation and examples to several common OO problems. This book is written for people who are already quite familiar with programming. This would'nt be a good book for a newbie, or someone who just wants to take a glimpse a OO for fun.It presents OO concepts in a structural, formal way, using a precise vocabulary so that somewhat medium-level programmers will understand clearly."
5,Goose Bumps,"The album brings BHTM in person shows, live to your living room. Every cut is great. Simply the Best!"
5,"Todd, Brian and Robert deliver with a great live sound.","BHTM is the ultimate live band. Their energy and enjoyment of performing live shines through in ""Live Monsters."" A must-own for any fan."
5,Great CD!,"It took awhile for me to enjoy the songs on this CD, but once I did, I couldn't stop listening. There are romantic songs, funny songs, powerful songs. A little something for everyone. If you don't enjoy it at the first listen - don't give up! This CD will definately grow on you!"
4,Beautiful Picture...,"THERE IS NO ENGLISH ON THIS DVD.If you go into the audio set up it lists English as an option, but selecting it is a waste of time.Once you realize that you can only watch this masterpiece, you'll see that language is not a barrier for love or life. The story is compasionate and meaningful, and above all; simple. They could be speaking chinese, sort of speak, and you'll still get the message. Its funny, its sad, and it has a great ending.For $15 , its worth a stab in the dark."
3,Simultaneously sexy and creepy.,"Some spicy sequences make up for a generally bizarre trek through a bewitched castle. Aimee Sweet fans (and I am one of them) will delight in her slow chapter one striptease. Following, a voluptuous dark-haired Pet dressed in a skimpy nurse's uniform sizzles as she talks dirty on the phone. Later, another dark-haired Pet is chained to a dungeon wall and pleasured by a feisty taskmaster. However, several scenes are spoiled by, well, 'creepiness': Two nuns indulge themselves in a church sanctuary. Two vampire women with bloody mouths french-kiss each other. Besides, reaching for a disc titled 'Harlots of Hell' is not necessarily conducive to... a stiffer member."
3,"Too arty, but some good stuff","This video is a bit too self-consciusly artsy for its own good sometimes, and as a result the pace, and the lighting doesn't do justice for some of the best pairs of breasts, hips, legs, mouths and backsides to ever appear in a Penthouse video. The artsiness is proabably to blame for the entirely unneccessary ""storyline"" as well. Film makers working in this kind of entertainment ought to stick to what their core competencies - the graphic depiction of sexy, well-built, naked babes with totally comfortable with their own bodies in hot scenarios, having sex -- with men, with each other, whatever. Some pretty good girl-on-girl action in this one, but of course not as satisfying as what you could get in one of Tera Patrick's hardcore appeareances. That chick is insanely hot as anyone who's watched Tera perform salacious oral sex in one of her XXX outings can attest. Nicky Guccione could do wonders with her if he put his mind to it. Maybe next time!"
1,this movie is not what you think,you would think being from penthouse that this dvd would be great well its not i don't have the time to explain but if all you wan't is to watch a stripper go to a strip club cause thats all this dvd is
2,Too Delicate,"Lovely and a great concept but FAR too fragile to be practical. This is an ICED tea glass which implies that ice is in the drink, but unless you ever-so-cautiously place each cube into the glass, the inside lining will crack. I've been afraid to take the last sip or two of a drink because if the ice slides to the top for that sip, it will also slide back to the bottom with unfortunate results. Bodum has replaced two of the four sets that I purchased, but I will not buy any more."
3,Great but very easy to break.,I bought these for my mother's birthday because she has always liked double walled cups; unfortunately they weren't out of the box 5 minutes before one was broke and what a shame considering the cost!!
4,great but fragile,"My glasses arrived promptly & on a humid day. They were much wider at the top & bigger overall than you'd expect from the picture, but they work as advertised : almost zero condensation even on a humid day. And the ice cubes don't melt for several hours, which is amazing.....Too bad I already lost one thanks to the tail of my Golden Retriever, after my girlfriend set hers down on a coffee table; it quickly broke despite falling about a foot or two onto a carpet."
2,Try the competition's glass...,"I read all of the review warnings and my Bodum glasses also suffered the same demise-which is a good thing really, because treating them like priceless heirlooms was making me mental.I then found glasses called Strong Double Wall Thermo glasses on Amazon that were cheaper and stronger than the Bodum's..They are heavier and may sweat just a bit more than the Bodum glasses and the 14 oz. really holds about 11.5 but what a relief to not have to panic everytime you use a double wall glass.Cheers."
3,A little BIG,I must have missed reading the description exactly. These are huge. Maybe 22 ounces?? I was wanting standard beer glasses but without anything of scale in the picture you do not know these are huge until they are yours. I have since found another pair of Bodiums closer to 13 ounces which hold a serving of beer better but they are more pub glass shape than beer glass shape.You would think it would be a no-brainer to produce a double wall beer glass that looks like a beer glass. And holds a 12 ounce serving.
4,A comfortable and well-written read,"This book is an excellent introduction for those familiar with computers, but is neither for dummies nor for rocket scientists.It is a well-balanced book suitable for both IT students and those working in the industry who want to know what goes on in PCs and system servers. The clean layout, the sequence of information presentation and the author's writing style makes this diffcult topic a joy to read about.Some criticism - the presentation of numbers could be reduced, the appendices on logic could be expanded and a chapter on client-server architecture would be the icing on the cake. Another worthy book but a bit dry is 'Silberschatz et al.'. Check it out before you buy."
2,Practice questions without giving any answers!,"Yes, it seems to be a readable book. But what kind of crappy book contains practice questions without giving you any answers? How am I supposed to use this book to study from if I have no way of knowing that my answers to the author's questions are right?Also, I would say that although Irv's writing style is readable it is wordy. It would be a much better book if there was a summary section following each section of each chapter. And if the damn answers were in there!"
1,I hate the book.,This book would be outstanding if the questions provided as a guide would be straight forward. The author tries to confuse the reader which just confuses the concepts.
1,For ages 5 and under,"This book is only helpful for extremely young children that want to learn about basic computer architecture. There is extremely little redeeming value about this book. The explanations of basic concepts are ludicrously laughable. The title should be changed from ""The Architecture of Computer Hardware and Systems Software: An Information Technology Approach"" to ""Watered Down Computer Architecture that is even too basic and elementary for even dummies and idiots"". Any money spent on this book is better spent on a pyramid scheme.If you want to learn about computer architecture, I would recommend: ""Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"" by John Hennessy and David Patterson."
2,"Too much useless detail, not enough context","Required text for a computer course...very poor. I would suggest a Scott Mueller book instead. Lacked context, went into too much detail."
1,This book is crappy..I use it for a course,This book tells you a lot about the computer but the problems at the end of the chapters are very BAD. The problems really don't correlate with the text. The problems are too vauge.
3,pretty ok,"it's not bad, i guess this album falls in the category of good enough. i'm bummed cause i loved their first album. just burn this from your buddy."
1,cheaper than buying CLEC stock,"Buying this book is a lot like buying stock in a CLEC - but you will lose less money! For $, you get 325 pages with no references or documentation of any kind. McDermott makes myriad assertions as with RBOC use of the regulatory process: ""They know how best to use it while their competitors looked at the process as a necessary nuisance to be put up with in order for them to get into business."" No substantiation needed - this is not an academic treatise but a statement of ""truth"" from somebody who has been there. The only remaining question is whether this book offers true insight to the CLEC industry and how it thinks of itself, or if this book is merely McDermott's attempt to capitalize on the fact that he was an important player in the industry. In the end, it is a lot like buying CLEC stock: is the business case real or hype?"
4,Good boot,Runs slightly bigger than my regular size. Very comfortable for a person who is not usually wearing hills.
4,I was a good price,I put this on my car in hope to reduce the vibration but it didn't help not that it wasn't good there is just something wrong with my car. It seems to be a good quality mount though.
3,Ghostly period drama -The queen of spades,"The 1949 origina cinema version of Pushkins short story the Queen of Spades, is a grandscale lavish period drama from Rusia that focuses upon greed, gambling and selling one's soul to the devil! This movie is not really a ghost story, it is more a lavish period drama that has fine acting and a credible story line that is quite impressive. But for the ghost conniseur, it is likely to leave you a bit dissapointed because there is only one short scene that really causes any fright or creepiness! The story is about a poor Russian army captain who is desperate to learn the secret of the cards and will do anything including stealing the secrets from an old countess who is believed to have sold her soul to the devil to gain the knowledge. The captain is a rogue and gets his in the finish. The movie has fine acting and some polished performances and is worth a look but don't expect too many thrills or chills.Alan Hollway"
2,Not as big as it looks.,Its just like the title says. Its really small when you get it. Batteries are included but its not what your looking far as real light goes.
1,Stop if you think you are buying tracks like CM!,"I have purchased over 300 cd's in the past 6 months and this is the worst.....I did not pay attention and thought it was a 2 cd set of Crystal Method, but no, it was a collection of the most lame wannabe 'afraid to be' techno I have heard.......if you like it, don't tell anyone!"
3,Rent (If You Can); Don't Buy,"This is a somewhat risky set to buy. Of the twelve or so hours available, I find very little to recommend to anyone. Guests at my place see the set and have my initial reaction (that being ""wow,"" or something like that), and are ultimately let down. Things like, ""That's it?"" The dry booklet that accompanies the set does't help alleviate things, either. I wathced and wathced, have found a few pieces that I adore, but regret that I spent so much for them."
2,"This is a Shell of a ""Set""",How does this set represent film history? I wasted my money. I want my money back.
4,A Different Kind of Food Fight,"My wife gave me this book as a not so subtle hint about how we fight a lot about what we eat. She diets frequently and feels that I'm not much of a help in that department. Well, I have to say, I'm not much for these types of books, but it definitely helped me to understand what she goes through and how I can help her while not curbing my style too much at the dinner table.It also talks about ""food cops."" Those are people that tell you what to eat and when to eat it. My wife used to do that a lot with me, but since reading the book she understands why it upsets me.The book gives a lot of tips on how you and your wife can compromise on the foods you eat to keep a happy relationship. I still wish my wife would have a pizza with me once in a while, but at least now I understand why it's not a good idea to just bring one home without asking her."
5,Finally!,"Finally! A book that addresses the food fights that couples experience. This book is chocked full of great advice, funny scenarios and more!"
4,the best book in the trilogy,"I was less than inspired by the first two Crystal Singer books. Killashandra was a fun heroine, but not too appealing, and her adventures were somewhat...silly. However, I hate leaving loose ends, so I started reading ""Crystal Line""...and was quite pleasantly surprised! Oh, the adventures here are still rather irrelevant. Killa and Lars could have been doing anything, that's not really the point. The point is, in THIS book, the profession of Crystal Singing, the joys and triumphs it brings and the hazards of the job are finally explored, and it's...haunting. Lars is sweet, though he still doesn't do much for me. Killa, however, finally stops being the diva and faces the past she struggled for so long to suppress and has to find what her heart is searching for. Through the course of the book, several loose ends are tied up (it's recommended that the reader not wait too long between reading ""Crystal Singer"" and ""Crystal Line""), and the ending is...perfect."
2,Barely makes the grade,"This book does not live up to first two books in the trilogy.This book was poorly written, although the ending is somewhat satisfying. Everything in between the beginning and ending could have been better,though.I recommend it only to die-hard McCaffrey fans, with the caveat that they will not find the quality work of ""Crystal Singer"",""Dragonflight"", or ""The White Dragon""."
5,A fine end to a great serise,"Killasandra and the love of her life, Lars, have both become experienced crystal singers. They enjoy all the perks of the job, lots of credit and long life, but they also suffer the draw backs, loss of memory. But, while Lars wants to remember the past, Killasandra doesn't care. This will eventually come between them.This book is a fine end to the serise, even though we do see, or atleast realise, that many of the origanl minor characters have died. It also finaly confermes the hints we got in the other to books that the series is set in te same universe as the brainship serise (eg Helva)The end part of the book made me cry because Killasandra forgets Lars and just when she remembers what they had it looks like she has lost him forever.This book is a must!"
3,Great ending to the trilogy;,"I love the CRYSTAL SINGER trilogy----KILLASHANDRA is my favorite of the three, although I like this one as well. Make sure you read the three CRYSTAL SINGER books in the proper order (CRYSTAL SINGER first, then KILLASHANDRA, then CRYSTAL LINE)---if you don't, you'll have a hard time following what is going on. This end to the trilogy does have a few minor flaws and inconsistencies, but as always with McCaffrey's writing, her plot and universe is so compelling, you'll keep reading anyway."
5,McCaffery's Crystal Line,Ann McCaffery writes a strong story. Her protagonist is always well developed and the plot holds your attention. If you have never read her before you will enjoy the experience.Jim H.
4,The Conclusion to the Crystal Singer,"Crystal Line, the third book in the series, had it's high moments. But unlike the first book, which I would give 5 stars, this book lacked a bit of movement. The plot seemd a bit slow compared to the first and second book. Perhaps there was less of a life or death moment in this book. There also seemed to be fewer characters to brighten up the dialogue. And now that the readers have been in the ranges a few times, a short return to them seems rather mundane. But for a conclusion to this series, this book is spot on."
5,Crystal Singer Series,"I love these characters, and I am glad this book gave me a chance to see them evolve. New ideas for the series are presented, so I hope we get another book soon about the Junk Jewels."
5,"Glorious cinematography, compelling acting","One of the most cinematically beautiful films you will see this or any year. It is a treat for serious cinephiles; but is probably too subtle and slow for most mainstream tastes. Jeremy Irons is wonderful, as usual, and Patricia Kass is hauntingly beautiful and compelling. The story is thought provoking at times, slightly quirky, and implausible with moments of subtle humor; but it is all thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The script too is mostly perspicacious with a few memorable lines such as, ""Life is a deep sleep. And love is the dream."" The film is mostly in French with some English. The subtitles are easy to read on the widescreen DVD format."
4,"Simple, Complex, Delightful",I'm sorry this film disappeared from the theatres so quickly. I wanted to see it again and take my friends. The story is a new twist on the old theme of the erudite jewel thief. The balanced mixture of French and English languages was stimulating and pleasing for me. I felt the love story was just the right blend of disappointment and satisfaction. The location shooting in France and Morocco entertaining. Jeremy Irons' acting was superb. The story and dialogue over all was multi-layered and mysterious - an experience worth repeating.
5,"IRON""S PULLS OFF ANOTHER GOOD PERFORMANCE","This movie takes place in Morocco, Iron's performance is great as usual. The scenery is beautiful, when I was there last year I kept looking for him around the towns I visited. Talk about wishful thinking."
5,super,one of the most interesting and well acted stories i have seen for years. in hawaii it would be called hana ho..or do it again. jc
2,It takes an iron will to sit through this one,"Jeremy Irons makes this worth a look, but it takes 45 minutes too long to get where it's inevitably going. There are some good comedic bits, but most of the movie is given to French characters reciting their lines in ennui-laden tones. A lot of screen time is spent on lounge singing numbers; it might be more pleasant to listen to the soundtrack than watch the movie."
1,This is NOT Bill,"I'm sorry to say it but I dont think this is a very good Bill Frisell album. It sounds a bit over-pretentious to make covers of orchestral music and it doesnt come out very well in my opinion. Besides anything that contains a song by Madonna, by definition cannot be good, right? These songs are all cover stuff that might be ""interesting"", if you like these songs in their original format, but for jazz-people: obviously there was a reason why we chose to listen to jazz and NOT to pop. Instead I would highly recommend listening to Ghost Town, Good Dog Happy Man, Nashville or Sound of Summer Running to get some real fresh genuine samples of Bill's harmonic world and abilities as a composer."
1,goes on and on and on and ...,"Not sure if it's all the good tech books have made me picky, this is one of the worst tech books I've read. Imagine an old school teacher keeps telling you all the theories about something without telling you how to do it? This is it. I wish I could return it for my money.For the 1st half of the book, it seems the only thing XML::Parser can do is to print out what's parsed. I refuse to believe so."
4,Convenient & Cost Effective,"I am just grateful to move from the tradional 35mm and flash. I tried it the old way when I received a camera for my high school graduation 20 years ago. I missed a lot of good pictures through assembling my previous camera. Naturally, just turn this camera on, point, and shoot! Love that! My only dismay is battery life. It's short and maybe Olympus should include rechargable batteries with the camera. I read some of the other reviews, and I'm sorry people aren't as thrilled. The first thing people say about my camera is how jealous they are of the LCD resolution [lol]. It is like watching a minature TV! I used the self timer and video capability... Great! No sad stories to tell..."
1,So Disappointing - Broke on vacation in Hawaii,"I had this camera for 14 months. I took it on vacation in Hawaii and the lens motor went out. There was nothing a technician could do, and my warranty expired two months prior."
4,Good for the job but screen a little hard to read,Has a lot of nice features but the screen has to be held looking directly at you in order for you to read it. This could be improved but over all a good calculator
1,I have used this calculator before but would not buy it from this supplier.,I have bought and used this calculator before but not from this supplier. I was traveling went it arrived so I didn't open the package for a month. When I did open the calculator didn't work and when I contacted the supplier they said it was two late. I was 3 days after the cut off. I would never buy from these people again.
5,Calculator,"I've owned the HP 17B for several years and it has work well for me. The controls are easy to use, and it only shows you the keys you need. I like the simple layout of the keyboard."
2,OK until the keys quit,"Great calculator, and HP's excellent manual does the job. HOWEVER, it should last. The early HP25 could be dropped off the table, and I still have one - unfortunately the battery died, or it would be active still. The operator keys stopped working on my 17BII. Power came on, self-test wouldn't test, and the operator(+ - x, etc. ) had no effect. People should buy HP calculators because they work well, they are well documented and they LAST. No matter how marvelous a calculator is, if the keys don't work, it is less than a paperweight.Charles Elliott"
3,HP18's Algebra mode: No precedence for multiplication/division over Addition/Substraction,"I bought this calculator on the basis of good review here.True, most of the good things mentioned in reviews here are indeed true but I found out one major flaw in the ""algebra mode""for this calculator.In the past, I have avoided HP calculators becuase HP insists on RPN. So I was happy to have an HP calculator with both algebra and RPN until I found out about ""Algebra mode"" in this calculator.In other algebra calculators, it is clear that the following is true:3 + 4 * 5 = 23But HP 18 gives me the following result:3 + 4 * 5 = 35In other words, it is not algebra, in the sense that is taught in the school."
5,Great calculator for those in financial services industries,"One of the best features of this calculator is that the calculations (i.e. present value/future value calculations and basic mortgage payment calculations)are menu driven using a series of buttons at the top of the calculator. You simply input the data per the associated input button. In addition, this calculator is a lot easier to use than the 12B which is the standard in the leasing industry. The 17B version allows you to input your data in a straight forward fashion rather than the ""reverse"" data input method of the 12C. HP also did a good job with the instructional booklet you receive with the calculator. The booklet gives you numerous sample problems and does a good job of highlighting the capabilities of the calculator in an easy to understand format without all the technical jargon. I wouldn't be without this calculator."
4,This calculator is NOT allowed by AIMR !,"Contrary to several reviews espousing this calculator and simultaneously mentioning the CFA exams, as of this past year the 17BII is NO LONGER allowed for use in the CFA exams. This may be a wonderful calculator, and I am thinking of buying one for other purposes, but if you plan to buy one for use in the CFA program, do NOT buy this calculator - buy the TI BAIIPlus or the HP-12C (the latter is my favorite)."
5,This is a great financial calculator,"I've had one of these since 1992 and I love it. I just came across this site when I thought I had lost mine and I was freaking out wondering how I'd get by without it.I'm a little surprised that it hasn't dropped in price over the years and I'd like it if it had a rolodex-type function, but you can sort of get that by storing addresses and numbers as functions.The financial functions rock, as does the solve menu. The menu-driven format is also neat, as it saves on clutter on the keypad."
2,Flawed display,"I have owned an HP 12C for years. I thought that getting this more modern calculator would be better because of it's menu driven interface. I like the interface although i still like the form factor of the 12C better. But what really bothers me is the display. The contrast to get the menu's to work is awful. You have to look at the display at just the right angle to see the numbers. Really poor design. If they corrected this flaw, which i consider major, then i would vote for it over the 12C. With the display flaw however, my vote goes to the 12C. It is plenty fast enough for the majority of standard financial calculations. It's form factor is great. It is a classic."
3,Glaring omission,"I bought a book club edition of this work several years ago, and was immediately disappointed to find that it did not contain entries for ""science"" or ""scientific."" This information could be particularly useful in relation to the current public debate over ""intelligent design"" versus Darwinian natural selection for use in high school science lessons as explanations for the origin of species. Otherwise a useful little reference no home should be without."
5,Very Capable for Business or Personal Use,"I bought this calculator as required equipment for my CFP program. It is far more capable than the old TI BA-II I had used for years. I spent about an hour going through the well written manual and doing practice problems to familiarize myself with the calculator's logic. You can do all kinds of cash flow analyses with it that are not possible on the TI. I use the Time Value of Money calculations frequently, and you can even change the payments and rate of return in specific periods. The only thing it won't do is print out the information!I would recommend it for any financial professional or a serious do-it-yourself financial planner."
1,Worked for 3 minutes,"My HP 10B finally busted, and i ordered this one. It worked for all above 5 minutes and then entire rows of keys quit working (similar to what mine did). Companies should not sell products that are not thoroughly tested. Unbelievable."
3,JUST OK,"WORKS FINE, BUT THERE ARE DENTS IN THE CASE SURROUNDING THE SCREEN. I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
4,You get used to it,"Rose is kind of tired of being seen as just a maid. Her sister, Norah, has just been fired from her waitress job. Rose's married boyfriend, a cop, assures her that her skills are useful - cleaning crime scenes pays well. Talking Norah into joining her the two start a business doing just that. It's not easy or fun, but Rose is proud of her work, still managing Norah, raising a son, dealing with dad, being the other woman? It's not such an easy life to live. Can any of them really handle it?It did feel like there could have been a little more done with this movie, still over all a good movie."
4,DVD movie,"I like the movie it has several funny parts and the story line is great. There were a couple of sex scenes that I felt could have been left out and still had a great movie...not a ""family"" movie by any means."
3,Fun with good acting,"Sunshine Cleaning is a fun, light movie but nothing very special. Amy Adams and Emily Blunt are very good at their roles, although Adams is almost too good at being pathetic - you want to throttle her at times for being so mousey and passive. Alan Arkin rehashes his role in Little Miss Sunshine, so he is a disappointment. The movie is entertaining enough, but quirky employment aside it is a pretty standard plot with no surprises and a big fat happy ending as expected."
2,Cute little movie,Clifton Collins Jr stands out in the movie. It is a nice little film but nothing great. Alan Arkin is a favorite of mine and his role is a bit blah. The two girls are good but again just nothing outstanding. It is kind of depressing too.
4,This quirky movie touched me,I liked the bond between the sisters who both are longing for a mother who died in their youth. Amy Adams is fun to watch as she tries to make things work in her life with very little family support and she inspires her family to support her.
4,Sunshine Cleaning,"I liked Sunshine Cleaning, it has a good cast, it moved along nicely and had a bit of humor thrown in."
3,"Loved the trailer, liked the movie","The trailer for this movie really peaked my interest in seeing it. I love the idea of a couple of sisters starting a crime scene clean up company. I was expecting it to be a bit more of a humorous movie than it actually was. Of course the movie was riddled with bits of dry humor, the indie way of making people laugh, but it wasn't what I was expecting after watching the preview.There are long scenes without a lot of dialogue, that can be a bit exasperating. There is also a lot of dramatic emotion in the film. I think that I would have liked it more had I not been misled by the trailer.Not a bad movie, but not something I would strongly recommend."
3,"Stars for Blunt, Arkin, and Adams.","The stars are for the three main actors here, and maybe a nod to Steve Zahn, who appears all too briefly. The kid is just okay. The lesbian angle goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing.Adams, Blunt, and Arkin do a good job with a script that isn't such good stuff. It could have been funnier, more poignant, with a less disappointing ending....spoiler ahead...There's no way Norah could afford to go on a road trip.There just isn't much to say except that this started out with a decent premise but just didn't get the job done."
2,Colorful melodrama,"An Albuquerque close to dysfunctional family never seems to get a break. Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams) has a son (Jason Spevack) that is too smart for his own good, a father (Alan Arkin) that has all kinds of economic get rich schemes, a sister (Emily Blunt) that does not seem to be able to hold a job, a married boyfriend etc.As circumstances, have it Rose gets and opportunity to make it big with a biohazard cleanup company, SUNSHINE CLEANING. Of course, even then she has her usual luck. With a little help, maybe one day the tide will change for her. Then again, maybe the film will end.I have only seen the Blu-ray version and I am surprised at the lack of extras."
1,Tedious,"Rose (Amy Adams) is a down-on-her-luck single mother and her sister Nora (Emily Blunt) is a perpetual loser. Together they decide to open a crime scene cleaning service.Although heavily advertised as by the makers ofLittle Miss Sunshine, this movie has none of its charm, wit, and poignancy. ""Cleaning"" suffers from a weak script, a complete lack of humor, and characters that are tragic but unlikeable. Adams alternates between whining too much and grinning too much and Blunt is just annoying. Even Alan Arkin is boring as the girls' father (who looks old enough to be their grandfather).24's Mary Lynn Rajskub does her ""Chloe"" character in a completely pointless subplot.The story is depressing and the writing is unimaginative. Not recommended."
4,A bright little movie,"""Sunshine Cleaning"" is a charming little movie that stars Amy Adams and Emily Blunt as two down-on-their-luck sisters living in New Mexico. In an effort to increase her income so she can afford to send her troubled son to a private school, Rose (Adams) recruits Norah (Blunt) to help her start a cleaning service that specializes in crime scene clean-ups.While more melancholy than I expected, ""Sunshine Cleaning"" is an endearing film that never lost my interest. I recommend it."
5,Good Movie,I enjoyed this movie. It deals with real issues without being overly sentimental or cute.Two hours well spent - ENJOY!
3,"Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Alan Arkin shine in ""Sunshine""","this is what I would call a ""character piece"" movie...normally a movie like this will focus on one main character, but here with get three characters, two sisters and their father, and their interactions. The plot is interesting, but I found the acting and the interactions among the characters even more fun.essentially, it shows you the struggles of a family- an unwed single mom who is trying to work and care for her child at the same time. Her younger sister, who's a bit of a slacker and doesn't have any goals in life. And their father, who is always trying to scheme to make a quick buck.at times funny, other times sad, other times melancholy...it is a realistic movie about a financially struggling family trying to stay together in difficult times."
2,This Film Is Not Complete,"There is something missing with this film - it is not complete. There is only a glimpse into a few days of these character's lives. Amy Adams is great, but Alan Arkin is turning into a caricature actor - this is NOT Little Miss Sunshine. The film's setting is New Mexico and is beautifully filmed. Amy Adams' Rose is ""strong and a winner"" as she tells herself each morning from a Post-It on her bathroom mirror. Then why is she stuck in a going nowhere affair with her married, ex-jock high school boyfriend? Emily Blunt's Norah also has issues - she cannot keep a waitress job at a ""restaurant"" that is really a lunch counter which does not need a waitress. There are tragic family issues beyond the Dad's business schemes that do not work out. And the crime scene cleanup business does not work out the character's or the family's issues. There are some cute scenes and some touching scenes; but this film leaves many, many questions unanswered."
2,Not!,"Although it has a few funny moments, I did not appreciate being brought into the ever-present gay-friendly relationship that you seem to find now in so many movies that seemed designed to teach us that we are NOT supposed to think that homosexuality is aberrant or wrong, or other raunchy things that this movie has. I give it a 2."
3,"Not quite what everyone expected, but not bad","A lot of the early buzz on this movie expected it to be the next indie film to break the genre barrier and cross over to mainstream audience, as did Juno and Little Miss Sunshine. The trailers left the impression of a film both lighter and edgier than Sunshine Cleaning turned out to be.That said, Sunshine Cleaning is a perfectly decent little independent tale of family disfunction leavened with a little quirkiness and humor. There are good performances all around and Adams and Blunt are credible as sisters. If you like independent films or are an adult fan of Amy Adams or Emily Blunt, Sunshine Cleaning is worth your time."
4,Real movie with real people,"My wife and I picked up this movie as an afterthought and we were glad we did. Another review mentioned that they were dissapointed that the movie ended so soon. I felt that as well - in a good way, like I wanted to see what else would happen.Acting was top notch and as others pointed out, the scenes and situations were more like real life. As the two sisters went about their new ""job"" my wife and I were asking questions like, ""whoa, can you do that without the health department or some agency not having issues with it"". The movie does not dissapoint and addresses those things in a realistic manner. Good character development which lead me to care about these people."
4,Quirky,"I like this weird little movie. I didn't really expect to, based on the subject matter. Two sisters decide to get into the ""biohazard removal"" business...which translates to cleaning up after crime scenes...YUCK! Hey, it's a job, and someone has to do it...and apparently it pays very well. I related to Amy Adams character and the way she is ""stuck"" in her own life. She and her sister are haunted by their own mom's suicide and this storyline just underscores what a selfish act suicide truly is. The movie should be depressing, but somehow, it's uplifting. It's one of those quite little movies that makes you think...whether you want to or not."
3,Little Miss Sunshine: Part II,"Okay, it's not really that similar to LMS, but you have yet another eccentric performance from Alan Arkin and that indie feel throughout the rather short running time. I expected more humor in Sunshine Cleaning, but it plays as more of a straight forward drama, with some funny moments popping up few and far between. The cast is very good, with Amy Adams and Emily Blunt turning in strong performances that keep this little flick watchable. Alan Arkin is okay here, but he is given little to do. At least he had some funny lines to work with in LMS (though he didn't deserve the Oscar). The story of two women cleaning up crime scenes sounded interesting to me when reading the description, though they didn't spend enough time dealing with that unique line of work. Nothing special here, but not a total waste of time thanks to the two female leads."
2,Left Me Wanting More,"Pretty good movie. Kinda seems a little thrown together and choppy. I wish it had more race footage and insight into the sport. I feel like it was trying to sell me the whole time and never really followed through. If you are a big fan of supermoto and are very knowledgable of the sport, than this is probably not for you. If you are new to it and don't really know much, you may like it. It does have some really good rider interviews, though."
2,Scary ....,"If you want to scare the daylight out of your guests, keep one of these in their room. When they go to sleep and turn the lights out - all the animals sound off in unison, they would never suspect the harmless looking peg puzzle for the noise it makes. Even with the pieces in place, it starts making the ""farm animal"" noise when the lights are turned on/off."
2,Irritating puzzles,"My son got 2 of these puzzles for Christmas....and they are not worth the extra money for the sound. They are controlled by light sensitive technology, so even when the pieces are in place, they make noise if I turn off the lights or a shadow walks by. We took the batteries out, they were so disruptive and scared our son when they randomly went off. Just buy the regular peg puzzles, they are just as effective, and not annoying like these!"
3,You too should get U2 with Collins and Dan,"A very nice compilation of artists for the easy listener. The archive film footage and interviews with the members of U2 and Phil are very interesting and informative. But most importantly, the songs sound very good. I can remember hearing ""With or without you"" on the radio and wanting to buy the audio tape when it came out, but this is even better. I enjoyed it, having grown up around these artists, but I'm not sure I would suggest it for the younger generation or for people who just don't enjoy Phil Collins type music. I enjoyed it so I give it three out of five stars."
3,"Not bad at all , but still","I havent heard all of the other DsotM albums so i cant compare this album to the others. I can however compare this album to other ambient/dub albums available. Overall the albums starts out pretty good, but by the second track the overall use of comb filters on the voices just dont do it for me. It sounds very dated and i cannot listen to most of the tracks where this filter is used (which is almost all tracks except for number 1).also they tend to over-use the same synthesizer patch on the album which makes one feel like you are listening to some mad performer on his Synthesizer. Its not bad , but when it starts sounding like improvisational Jazz being played on a Synth it gets a bit much and i have to skip to the next track.Personally i still like the album, but would rather spend my money on something else unless you want to collect the whole series of these albums."
4,Tick.. Tick..,"There have been very few triumphing bands that have ever came out of the U.K. since the 1960's. During the past 10 years, there wasn't any really until Coldplay came along in the late 90's. The music they've made is very melodic and unbelieveable. It is just too bad that there are very few of them to have the drama here in the U.S. Their latest, Clocks, taken from the album A Rush Of Blood To The Head, is a melodic, seducing rhythm that is still as fresh as it was released later on down the road. I thought it was an unbelieveable voice that Chris Martin, the lead singer has, and the band itself has definitely tried to own. They're definitely keeping up the pace with this song. With their latest single, The Scientist starting a storm of its own, Coldplay will definitely be around for a long time."
2,"Over-played, ""soaring"" anthem!","Despite sounding good after a first listen, this track has suffered from overexposure. I hear it on tv ads touting s__t products; as background music for ""inspiring"" sports highlights; girl violin groups (you know, the ones trying to make classical ""sexy"") doing renditions; generally, any person or group looking to create some sense of majesty! oooh! excitement! grandeur! I'm getting chills! Fake nonsense like that. It's not Coldplay's fault. The best thing would be for this song to be deleted as a single and removed from future pressings of ""A Rush..."""
2,Not crazy about this one,"I have read other books by Stuart that I really liked - ""Glass Houses"" is a particular favorite - but this one was too dark for me. I like Stuart's writing style, and the first third or so of the book is wonderful. It is about how Danny and Katharine first fell in love, and I really did believe that he loved her. Which is what made me dislike the rest of the story. I was nearly as distraught as Katharine to realize that the man who supposedly loved her so much was able to make himself forget her completely for a decade, to the point that he no longer even recognized her. That's not only unbelievable to me, it is also unromantic. Mac was able to convince Katharine that he had re-fallen for her, but Stuart didn't convince me. I will avoid any more of her books that have a time gap/reunion theme, because this was not a fun read for me."
5,The best choice!,The best programable calculator is right here. Thing every engineer must have. Version 48G+ comes with 128K RAM at the price of 48G with 32K RAM. Relly powerful tool - I like it.
3,Disappointed,"I am an engineering student and now see why my university recommends the TI-83. I'm sure the HP 48G has more features and is generally more powerful, but the user interface stinks. This is so hard to manipulate that I must carry a second calculator just in case I need a quick calculation. The RPN format is absolutly miserable and I have no idea why one would want this on a calculator. Another drawback is that the users manual falls FAR short when it comes to programming. The calculator falls even shorter and doesn't even have a If/ GOTO command for loop structures. If an engineer in training can't easily use this calculator, you'd better be a rocket scientist to expect much more. Unfortunatly I will have to buy a TI-83 to overcome the programming shortcomings, a move I should have made originally."
4,Seems to help with cramps!,"I was having a problem with leg cramps and monthly women's cramps. Adding this to my diet when I would start having muscle cramps or menstrual cramps seemed to help subside the cramps, however, the best remedy for intense muscle cramps has been the Caleb Treeze Muscle Cramp relief that you just rub on and I swear your muscle cramp is completely gone within 2 minutes and doesn't return for at least 24 hours or more. I buy both from Amazon."
4,Solgar Magnesium Citrate,"I tried this product to help with my restless legs. While it did work for this problem the side effect of diarreah caused me to quit using it. A lesser dose of it did not help with the restless legs. If you can handle the dosage, it is a great product."
2,Not 400 MG TABLETS!!!,They are not 400 MG each tablet. It is 200 mg tablets and you need to take two to get a 400 mg dose. You cannot see the mg per tablet on the bottle in the picture. Be careful.
2,Too academic,"I was drawn to the notion of 800 hundred years of carols. Much to my chagrin, the collection gets bogged down in medieval and renaissance stuff which is not all that tuneful. The selection is too restricted. I'm sorry I bought it."
1,"It arrived with NO HARDWARE!!!, no M8 or M10 bolts!!!",The package arrived taped up and the box was completely ripped.How am I supposed to put this together??? I now have to go and buy $20 worth of bolts!Terrible
5,Pure Pleasure!,"Whether it's Perdido, C'est Comme Ca, or Flying Down to Rio, Daryl brings a unique and delightful touch to her selections. I listen to this CD all the time."
4,one of the funniest h/k movie!,"get this dvd if u like hong kong movies and stephen chow,it's really funny.i cant stop laughing when i watched it.even if it is not as good as hail the judge(stephen chow's best)"
5,A Point,"Teagen Phillips is a rich teenager that thinks that this will be the best party of the century. But what Teagan finds out is not what she expects! When trying to get wine from a cellar after she found out that her dad cancelled all alcohol from her party, she falls down the stairs and she is dead. When a strange woman in white appears above teagan when she is awoken she gets to look at few things she wasn't expecting. She finds out that her best friend and her boyfriend were secretly making love behind her back,and she is forced to find out what her future holds.When Teagen finds out what her future holds she is given a second chance to change things before she experiances an early death from cosmetic surgery. And her life was coming better by the time she awoken!"
1,caution,I caution teen and tween readers about this book. It talks about having sex with her boyfriend and getting wasted and drinking on her 16th birthday. I don't think that this sort of stuff needs to be written about in teen books.
5,Very happy with DVD,"We are just starting to teach our four and five year olds Spanish, so we bought a few teaching aids, including Learn Spanish with Carlos & Chiquitita. Some items didn't take, but the kids really enjoy this video! The animation is fairly primitive, but for some reasons the kids really like it. The video packs a lot into a half hour (the family, vowels/animals, parts of the body, food, basic phrases, etc.) and the dialog intersperses some more challenging word along the way, so the kids learn more the more they watch. The DVD works particularly well at combining entertaining songs with animation, which our kids ask to watch again and again. It also comes with a helpful guide book to help parents, and includes subtitles in English and Spanish, to help parents who don't know Spanish. I only wish this company had more than one Spanish teaching aid!"
3,"Not the best alone, good as a supplement.","I bought this to review it for my students - I had some mothers ask me if I thought it would be a good teaching aid. So here's my take on it, as a Spanish teacher:As a reinforcer to a Spanish class for 3 to 5 or 6 year olds, I think it's a good DVD. It is quite short for the money, but you can bet that the children will get more out of it each time they watch. Alone, I don't know how helpful it willl be - maybe to motivate your child to want to learn more. As an addition to Flip Flop Spanish (a workbook my students use with a CD) it fits very well, and adds a lot - presenting the information in a new format.All in all, you can find better sources for less money, but my three children (ages 4, 2, and 1) did sit through it and repeat a lot of the words, but I speak to them in Spanish frequently, so it didn't give them anything new.Sra. GoseAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 & Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 2"
4,Good Video with a few small flaws,"Que dice el pato? From watching this just one time I learned how to ask my son what the animals say, and he knows what I am saying. The video is primitive yes, but as another reviewer said, the kids like it. The sound quality gets very loud during the songs and you have to keep turning it down, so it is a little pricey. However if it had perfect sound quality the price would be worth it. I think this is one video that we can watch over and over and over again and learn something/reinforced every time. The scenes are all relevant, bathing, playing with sister, animal identification, family, etc. I would recommend buying this, just dont overlook the sound and the animation. I didnt like it at first, but the more I watch it with my son, the more I see he is learning from it (and I am too), and that is what is important."
3,Learn Spanish with Carlos & Chiquitita,Not as good as ROCK N' LEARN:SPANISH but your kids or you can still learn some good stuff. Also the DVD was a little shorter than I expected.
4,Easy to learn . . .,"I am a single mother of a two year old daughter living in Chula Vista, California. I am wanting my daughter to learn and speak another language, spanish, other than english. After purchasing ""Learn Spanish with Carlos & Chiquitita"" and practicing the spanish with my daughter, I am amazed at how quickly she and I are learning spanish together. The DVD has made learning fun and easy."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"This DVD is terrible! The graphics are awful, the pace is too fast, and their is nothing appealing about the characters. I am a Spanish speaker and a Speech/Language Pathologist, I decided to buy this for my 4 year old to aid in her acquisition of the language. She did not even make it through the first 5 minutes and I can't blame her. Who really cares if a duck says Cuac Cuac? Instead of introducing words like ""mama"" and ""papa"" in isolation first it begins with sentences. The whole video is in Sapnish except for an intro to each section, since my child does not know Sapnish and is being told sentences with no explanation she was not able to follow along.This DVD is definitly not worth the price!!!"
2,Poor sound quality and low budget at best.,"This was done very poorly and my kids are not even slightly amused. They jump at a chance to watch anything on the TV, because we have no channels, and they asked me to turn it off.Poor sound, so the annunciation during the songs is not discernible. The music is louder than the words, which is typical of Hispanic music, but not really functional here, lol.Pay a little more and get a better program.I thought it would be good for the car entertainment system, but it's a little too unnerving for driving.It seemed to me it would be something with a story-line, maybe about a boy and his dog, but it's not really. I'm sure my kids will get it's worth in a few words learned, concerning parts of the family and how to chat about the number of people in it, though. Not a total loss maybe?"
4,Good complement to the study guide,"Although I have not tried to pass the real test, I've found this book to be a good companion to the study guide from the same editor. The focus/spirit of the exercices looks different to me and that is interesting for the exam, or for the real life.I like the structure . Most part of the book is actually filled with exercices. This is a test book for people wanting to practice before the test."
3,It's ok,"I bought this book about a week before I took the exam (because it was onsale and [inexpensive], just to get exposure to more questions. One good point about the book are the detailed explainations for practice question answers. But some of the questions were similiar to the ones I'd already seen in books I'd read - Network+ Passport and the Network+ Cert Bible. Also, they didn't relate much to ones on the actual test (which I passed with no problem). While it didn't impress me, it may give some people exposure to information that hadn't seen before. BUT if you already have two solid books for reference, don't waste your money. If I could have, I'd have given it 2 1/2 stars."
4,Really cool CD,"This cd is really cool! Some of my personal favs on the CD are Least of These (feat. Mac Powell from Third Day), God Looks at the Heart, and Fall on Us. Alot of the music has somewhat of an 80's oldschool feel to it, and it is unique, but it grew on me quickly. Check it out!"
2,Not good at all,I was looking foreward to seeing this movie and it started out good but the ending scene with them going one on one was the one thing in the movie that just made it bad. Omar is great in it and the story is good but the way it was filmed was terrible.
4,Our favorite movie from when we were youngens,My husband and I love this movie. We were in high school when it came out and it's right up our alley. Love love love. A classic in our household.
5,Amazing,It's a really great love story between the girl next door and a guy who has been with a lot of women. Great twists in the story and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!
4,It's Got Game,"I was forced to watch this movie as a concession to the girlfriend, but I actually really liked it. It's got great acting and the basketball scenes don't have a staged feel. The soundtrack was good and the story's romantic but not cheesy. I recommend it for guys and girls who want to watch something together they'll both enjoy."
5,Luv this movie!,"I truly love this movie, and it was extremely hard to find. I found it on amazon, and purchased it right away. I bought it for my own personal dvd collection. I seen the movie before but had to have it! Its a must see! Even my husband loves this movie!"
4,Love and Basketball,Good movie. Was recommended to me by my niece. Our family enjoyed it as much as my nieces. It is being shared with other family members.
5,Simply Wonderful!,"Love & Basketball is a wonderful, down to earth movie. I think this is a realistic movie. I give it all A's. I am a big fan of Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan. I don't think the writer/director could have picked any two people that were better.This movie has a great soundtrack, and setting. The music is absolutely ""the bomb"", ya gotta get the soundtrack. And I thought the upper-middle class life that Quincy and Monica live added a lot to the movies message.This movie was about love, basketball, and following your dreams. I would recommend this movie to all. Epps and Lathan... TWO THUMBS UP!!!!"
5,Women and Basketball,"This is an extraordinary movie. If you think women do not know how to play tough, then you really need to watch this movie. Love and Basketball is an excellent portaryl of how women can deal with love, a broken heart, family issues, peer pressure and still make a living and play the game of basketball with all heart. I recommend the purchase of this DVD to all basketball fans and to those who love a good love story."
5,A flick for your girl and you!,"This movie is the real deal! I love to watch it all the time. SANAA LATHAN(MONICA) is hot! OMAR EPPS(Qunicy) is fun to watch! Just a great film to watch with your girl. It shows that relationships can go through hard times, but they can make it if it's meant to be...."
3,Love and Basketball,"If you are like me and LUV basketball then this is a movie for you. If you are me and LUV Omar Epps, then this is a movie for you. If you don't know who Danaa Lathan (The Best Man, The Wood and Blade)is yet, then this is a movie for you.Basically, Love and Basketball is a great movie. A little teeny-bopper and predictable and all that jazz, but who cares? It is cute, sweet and it has girls playing some awesome ball, which is always a good thing.This is a romance wrapped around basketball. Or basketball wrapped around a romance. Either way, it has all the makings of a chick flick but it isgood anyway. Girl likes boy. Boy likes girl. They go steady. For about fiveminutes. They are friends. They get too cool for each other. They grow up.They get hormones. I am guessing you are seeing where this is going by now."
5,loved it,"This movie was a really pleasant surprise. I hesitated seeing this movie because I thought it would be another guy sports movie but it came recommended by a friend. I rented it then ended up buying it. The storyline is great, the love story really sweet and the music even better than I thought as well. Highly recommend it!"
5,Finally!,"This movie is to basketball players what ""Center Stage"" was to dancers! Cheesey and romantic, yes, but so satisfying! Finally there is a movie that combines romantic comedey and athletics-real athletics- into a great story! All basketball players remember the childhood pickup game that starts this movie off...and it just gets better. The movie chronicles the two main character's athletic careers, but focuses on the female player's struggles in a male dominated sport. The conclusion of the movie is triumphant and sooooo satisfactory. This is a must-see for any basketball player-especially females!"
2,Annoyingly long,I'm not drawn in by their relationship. You end up not really caring if they get back together - at least I didn't. The guy was kind of a jerk - the girl was kind of a pushover. It will keep your interest - it's just not memorable.
5,A Romantic and Athletic film,"Love and Basketball gets a thumbs up.They had the right actors and everything. Quincy and Monica, 11, started out as next door neighbors. They fell in love with each other. Later Q tryed to play Monica's heart because of her love for basketball, her #1 priority. He got engaged to Kyra played by actress Tyra Banks. I cried because he knew his heart was with Monica Wright. In a game of one on one basketball they showed their true love. They used expressions like ""Where's the D"" and ""Double or Nothing"".I am a true Omar Epps fan. He is so handsome and definitely a sex symbol. I really enjoyed the movie.Much LoveE.Alicia"
5,One of The Best Movies That I Have Seen In A Long Time!!!,I didn't go see the movie when it was out in theatres because I didn't think that it would be that enjoyable. Once I rented the movie and I had immediate regrets for not supporting while it was in theatres. I have watched this 5 times so far. This is a must-see for die hard romantics.
4,Love it,This movie is the best love movie I have ever seen. It is great to see with a date. Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps really do a wonderful job and they are also a great real life couple!
4,Great date movie,I thought that Love and Basketball was a sensational movie. i saw it the night it came out and i definetely got my moneys worth on this one. the relationshiop that is kept and changed all throughout the movie is what makes the movie interesting and watchable. the ending is phenominal. if i could take a date to any movie it would have to be this one.
5,nutritional supplement that can help some diabetics,"I read about this supplement as an aid for diabetics to help manage their blood sugar levels and,for me,it has helped. I would also suggest the book;'Prescription for Nutritional Healing"" by Balch-I've found this to be a great reference book for all health issues in general and particularly for my diabetes management."
2,disappointed,"i really, really, reallllly wanted to like this album, but, even after multiple listens, the majority of the tracks here just seem like filler. i fell asleep halfway through the record. it's a shame that the bonus tracks steal the show here [""transistor"" and ""making ladies"" especially]. it's almost as if they were trying too hard to sound fresh... when all they had to do was let their new york roots grow out. the packaging seems very gimicky. i like that they took risks with this one, but sadly, it doesn't work. *cringe* despite my opinion of this album however, the scissor sisters ROCK and more power to 'em."
5,Scissor Sisters DELIVER!,"If you loved the first album, you'll LOVE this new addition. Each song on the CD leaves you wanting more, and once you have heard the entire album a couple times, you'll want even MORE! I feel sorry for the people that don't know about the Sisterhood, but I'm quite happy to keep them to myself."
2,"I Don't Feel Like Dancin' Either, Boys and Girls","First time was a fluke, a sweetly ode/retread of AM disco swathed in Elton style camp-pop with a flair for glitz. Second time's a dud - less dance oriented, more dance-psychedlia from the same era. I was never one who took them for that disco label, anyway; too many Cat Stevens-style pabulum within the grooves. They are still, to overuse and already overused cliché, all style over substance, and the new-wave aesthete they adhere to results in static cling with nary a toe-tapper in earshot. It's still camp. But there's no pop. My grade: C+"
1,Sadly Disappointing...,"The best I can say about this music cd is the first song ""I don't feel like dancing"" is a great dance song no doubt about it. But one good song does not a cd make...and the song does get boring over and over again. The remaining songs are either just plain bad, strange or both. I listened to it numerous times hoping it would grow on me but sadly it has not. ""She's my man"" is passable but only because of the beat really, otherwise it falls short as do all the other songs. It goes from dance to rock to country sounding and somewhere between all of them at once. I know others like or even love it however I gave it a big chance and was sadly disappointed..."
2,No soul.,"I like the first album because it has a lot of soul and it has a quirky playful sound to it. This album fails to deliver in the songwriting department, save 2 or 3 songs. Even though their debut sounded retro, it still sounded completely original in its delivery, and thats what made it special.This album sounds like a carbon copy of late 70s songs, and extremely boring ones at that. I was extremely dissapointed, I was hoping for a more original direction for this band. I thought they could stay around for a long time. Maybe they still will be popular after this album, but I found it quite a step backwards from their debut."
1,This is bad,"Like most songs here in Europe, the single 'dont feel like dancin' mysteriously came out almost simultaneously on ALL radio stations. The song has since been played relentlessly non-stop 24-7 on all stations. Even if a song I liked was playing, I'd certainly get sick of hearing it so much. Didn't need to wait that long to get sick of this one though. At the first sign of the manufactured falsetto vocal, my skin cringed. The bridge to the song is a blood curdling synthesizer that pierces one's ears like a chain saw - a truly horrid tone. It's like the totally annoying whine of an infant at 4:00am - impossible to ignore. The 'music', if you can call it that, must have listeners attention, though it offers nothing. Brings no heart to the table. I can usually tune stuff like that out but this is appaling.There is absolultely no orinality whatsoever. Beegees with no smooth. Great marketing though(hence the 1 star). Five years from now you'll never admit to your friends that you bought it."
1,Sister Sludge,"I am an open minded person and I like many different genres of music but I can not beleive the praise the some are heaping on this group. It is one thing to be a cover band on a local sceen, it is another to call yourself a tribute band and tour, but the Scissor Sisters rip off so many artists that is is pathetic. Not just sounds and vibes mind you, practically entire song structures... At least when you hear Al Yankovic you know he is a put on... I had to endure this band live as they opened for Depeche Mode and it was so hard to respect their campy-rip off act. Sure, all artists borrow and steal a bit... the trick is to add something of your own to the mix... and that is where these Sisters fail. One star for being out and proud... they should save the rest for musical theater."
4,Ta-Dah cd by Scissor Sisters,This cd has a good selection of pop music including some danceable tunes. I have listened to it several times and have enjoyed the upbeat and lively tone of the music.
4,OMG!!!,"This whole CD is non stop fun and excitement. I felt like a disco dancing Queen when listening to this CD. It has a little bit of everything--dance songs, love songs, breaking up songs, getting together songs, etc. Love every minute of this CD."
5,A real gem!,"The Scissor Sisters have done it again, folks. This album just may be better than their first one. You might even catch your mom dancing to it, or at least tapping her foot. The world of music just wouldn't be the same without the Sisters!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible.","The first CD was inspired, but this CD is a complete failure. It seems like the band produced a CD just for the sake of producing a CD. All the songs sound similar. Please, save your money this CD is a waste of time."
4,The Evolution of Talent,"Granted, Ta-Dah isn't chock-full o'catchy tunes as the first was. However, musically, artistically and technically this one is far superior. I wasn't impressed at first listen. Most likely because I was expecting and wanting more of the same of the first. More chances have been taken here and it works well. This work shows an enhanced sophistication.I threw on the Sennheiser HD650's and cranked up the amp. AMAZING!Hey Scissor Sisters..... Oh YEAH! I'm really looking forward to following your evolution as phenominal artists and experiencing where your vision will take you all with your next release."
4,Take a Time Machine to 70's Glam,"Take two parts Bee Gees, one part Elton John, one part Queen, add a dash of eighties techno and shake vigorously ~ Ta-Dah. When I first purchased this album, I shyed away from it because of the abundant use of falsettos in the vocals. And so it sat, purchased but unused in a pile of music obtained over the holiday period. It was my loss. While I still find the falsetto a little annoying at times, it isn't used on every song on the album and sometimes it hits the mark dead on. The quirky (sometimes dirty) lyrics play along a bouncing beat that remind me of some of Freddie Mercury's more tongue-in-cheek creations. ""I Don't Feel Like Dancin'"", ""She's My Man"", and the darker ""The Other Side"" are more then worth the price of admission, but some of the other songs sound more like enjoyable, well-crafted filler. All in all this is a great second album from a band that deserves attention."
4,cleaned up a little I suppose,"I do love the scissor sisters and have since I first saw ""Take your mama out tonight"", on some music channel late one night. There seem to be a couple arguments as to the originality of their music. Of course that can be debated but what is really the point? My opinion (which I'll make short), there is rarely any original music anymore. Anyone can be compared to anyone. It's unfortunate but true. What I feel about the scissor sisters is they took quite a few different genres and ran with it. Honestly, they have songs for the club queen all the way to the rock ballad lover. I suppose the cd as a whole is most suitable for the eclectic. Those with say the violent femmes and Mika in the same playlist. You get my drift. Now I didnt give it five stars... and that was on purpose. I dont feel it was a groundbreaking album- but it is quite a ride, should you choose to let it be."
5,Must Have for all people interested in Kundalini,"This was a great work done by a great man. It tells the story of the horror and delight a yogi went through when he accidently tapped the powers of the serpent. Kundalini dwells within all of us and this book forwarns all who wish to awaken it. This book is Gopi's account of the changes which took place inside of him self and the complex bioelectric changes which must occur for Kundalini awakening.Although this is a great account of Kundalini awakening, it is not a book of exercises or practices. It is more of a warning of the pain one will go through if not prepared for the ""Evolutionary Energy"". Gopi has written many other books which deal with meditation, exercises, preparation, and the like.Even if you wish to find books which teach how to awaken the Kundalini through practice, this is still a must have. It tells of the different effects the Kundalini awakening will have on your body and also and added comentary from a respect psychologist."
4,required reading for spiritual emergencies....,"Everyone who thinks shamanic illness / an awakening kundalini / Spiritual Emergence is all fun, light, and rainbows ought to give this book a pre-shaktipat gander, written by a man brave enough to suffer through and go public with his own version. If the rather quaint, New Ageish attempts to explain the phenomenon in scientific-sounding terms get on your nerves, bear in mind that he had no better concepts with which to work. Thank God that he wasn't a citizen of the U.S., where he'd been given a diagnosis and medicated senseless."
3,"As usual, there's always a downside.","If you like adventurous music then this is an excellent pick, 75 minutes of interesting sound effects and rhythms. But, as is often the case, there are no liner notes which, especially when listening to composers with whom one is unfamiliar, cheapens the offering. Borrow it from a library or buy it second hand. Maybe Kronos will eventually get the message."
3,very inconsistent,"Like other Kronos releases, the music on one track will be fantastic, and on the next will be awful. I love Elliott Sharp's ""Digital"" (how he did that with a string quartet is beyond me), Henry Cowell's ""Quartet Euphometric"" and Stephen Mackey's ""Physical Property."" The Johnson, though, is tedious, and the Zorn piece is fantastically irritating and goes nowhere, and the Pandit Pran Nath is extremely boring. Oh well. Buy it if you can get it cheap."
3,Classic of the hair band days!,"I got the cassettes of these 2 albums in my collection. As far as late 80's radio freindly pop metal, these guys were perfect. The musicianship and guitar work on both albums are great as well as the production quality. Sadly on my part, these album got old really quick. Thrash metal had more of my attention at the time."
4,Excellent NFL Films Music,I enjoyed the music and John Facenda. I can visualize those old hi-lites when that music is playing...I got chills from it. I hope NFL Films comes out with a second edition with even more quotes from Mr. Facenda!
5,Revisit the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field and Lombardi,"Anyone who has ever enjoyed watching NFL films has to have this CD. Listening to the CD causes you to remember the legendary NFL games between Bart Starr and Dick Butkus; Daryle Lamonica and Len Dawson; or Johnny Unitas and Joe Namath. The late John Facenda adds commentary to some of the musical selections , but his voice is not obtrusive but is a pleasure to enjoy. My favorite selections are ""The Pony Soldiers"" and ""Lombardi"". The music on this CD has not been available to the public since the early 70's when NFL films issued some LPs that were difficult to locate. The only thing missing when listening to the CD is the snow and cold of Soldier Field and Metropolitan Stadium in Minneapolis."
3,"Meh, like the vinyl version better","This is a fun disc for those of us who watched ""This Week in the NFL"" way back when. I'm not too happy that they've updated the between-song comments with modern coaches. This did have a couple songs I didn't have on Autumn Thunder, though. Those two albums make for great background music during the fantasy draft!"
5,"This CD is ""The Bomb""! (from D. Lamonica to Warren Wells)","Whenever I listen to this CD, I think of all those old ""NFL Game of the Week"" TV shows, or throwing the football with my cousin when I was a kid, humming the great NFL music while pretending to make a diving catch for the winning touchdown. Gonna play this on SuperBowl Sunday! If you love the old NFL Films shows of the past, buy it. My only question is... when is vol. 2 coming out?"
3,Some good numbers,"A bit like Dick Dale would do, these songs are largely variations or altered renditions of existing songs. Even so, one can't help but see the wide shots at the snap of the ball to the sounds of Ramblin Man from Gramblin. One can't help but see the coach carried off by the SB winners when listening to The Raiders, even if it was not the Raiders. In fact, I think Raiders fans often know this particular tune.Other than that, there are some good numbers mixed in with audio clips. But it's somewhat inconsistent. And I wonder if some numbers that might have been more interesting were not included. I don't know. I like to think, that is, that I can put together an interesting 'mix tape'. I often wonder about those putting together 'greatest hits' albums, though. What have they left out that should be there?"
1,AWFUL!!!!!!,I ordered a cd from this seller. They said it would be here in 3 -21 days. 21 days for a cd? after 21 days and no cd I e-mailed the company to ask where my cd was and received no reply 2 days later a refund was given to me. I looked on the website and the cd was still for sale. instead of a refund why not just send me the cd that I ordered. there are 3 steps to this process. 1. I order cd. 2. they charge me for cd. 3. They send me cd. I am not sure how much simpler it could be. I will not be ordering from this seller ever again!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Facenda is God,"When John Facenda talks, mortals listen. The problem is that most of this CD comprises musical soundtrack intended to be the backdrop of video. What is lacking is the video. This CD should not be sold; instead, it should be only a DVD so that you could see the football action that was originally intended to be the focal point of this music.The best of this CD: The Autumn Wind, of course. It's poetry. It's pure John Facenda. It's legend. It's football. The rest of the orchestration should be relegated to the soundtrack of what I am now longing to see on my television, which unfortunately is staring back at me without any expression whatsoever.Long live John Facenda. (Now how about showing us his face in the recording studio?)"
5,THIS IS GREAT!,"Some of the best memories of my youth were watching the NFL GAME OF THE WEEK, THIS WEEK IN PRO FOOTBALL and the other weekly highlight shows on Saturday afternoon. Forget the (live) games on Sunday, they didn't have the Sam Spence soundtrack. This CD is great and proves Spence was a first class composer/musician. I have wear marks on my copy, especially PONY SOLDIERS. Where is Volume 2?"
5,Good sampling,"This CD contains classic NFL Films music and is interspersed with some classic comments by John Facenda. There are only two problems with the disc. First, the tracks containing players comments are stupid. Second, it doesn't have my favorite song, which goesDaaaaaaaa nanuhnananuhna na naDAAAA na nuh na na nuh na na naDuuuuuuuu duuuuuuuuh duh duh duh duhDit Duuhhhhhhh dunt do dut dutNAAA na nuh NAAAAA nanuhna naanuhnahnanaNAA na nuh NAAA nuh nuh naanuh nuh nuh nuh(repeat)oh, and it also doesn't have Spence's version of Greensleeves, which can be heard as the background to the ""Lombardi"" track and is often used in conjunction with Billy Kilmer clips.And yes, I am dead serious."
4,Must-have for NFL Films fans,"The stentorian narration of Facenda, combined with the brillant poetry of his words and the uplifting sheer power of the music will overwhelm you, make your hair stand on end and give you the feeling of lining up on the goal line to defend.Only one small nit-pick: a couple of the more famous tracks (the music and narration from ""the splintering impact of a forearm shiver..."" part about the linemen in the trenches, and the ""linebackers, the search and destroy men of the defense"") are missing. If these tracks had been included, I would have given it five stars. but still, this is a must have!"
5,"Great color, perfect video, uncut","These are some of the older Tom & Jerry's, uncut and in perfect video and color. An excellent value. Some of the scenes that are cut on TV are on this tape (such as the scenes with the Maid)."
3,Thank You!,Very accommodating and helpful. Gave prompt responses to my inquiries. Would do business with you again.
1,falling apart after 12 months!!!!!,"after only 13 months they are completely rusted and 1 literally broke into pieces! the other 2 are rusting and about to fall apart, for $50 each they should last longer than a year!!!!!!!!!!"
5,great cooking,"After replacing the heat plates on my grill, the cooking process took on a whole new deminsion. At first, I was reluctant to purchase the plates because of the cost so I purchased only two plates. After using them, I purchased the remaining plates and I have not been sorry."
2,Viking Stainless Steel Heat Plate,"Product works as described. One question - why does the original range, which was quite pricey, come with flimsy non-galvanized metal plates, which obviously have a short and planned obsolescence?"
4,Great for getting to know your friends even better,"This game was a blast to play with some friends of ours. I would recommend it highly for playing with friends you already know but would like to get to know better. I don't think it would be nearly as fun to play with people you hardly know. But for people you are getting to know, or good friends you think you know, this is the perfect game for a night of laughter."
5,This game had family Thanksgiving rocking!,"I have a very competitive family, so I was looking for a game that would be a bit harder to fight over. This was perfect! We had so much fun that most forgot who was winning! Also great because everyone can participate and have fun - unlike Trivial Pursuit where often younger people have a harder time. My only complaint would be that the board is not long enough - it takes about 30-45 minutes to go around the entire board. But, then we would just start all over again! A lot of fun - I highly recommend this one."
5,SO MUCH FUN!!!,"We always have family game night together. This game, by far, is our favorite. It is SO much fun. You find out a lot about each other, but it's also fun to try to trick the person. It's so funny to hear some of the answers. I would HIGHY, HIGLY recommend this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,C. Patterson,Great game for adults. Children under the age of 16 don't seem to understand the concept of true answers. Marvelous game for family or close friends. Allows a deeper understanding of each other. Lots of fun but takes longer than an hour.
5,Great game for older kids and adults,"This is a great game for parties or just a group of 4. I've played it both ways and everyone laughed and had a good time.The player who's turn it is to guess reads a question (for example, ""If you were invisible what would you do?"") and everyone else answers by writing on a piece of paper with their name at the top(it comes with a pad but we've used them all up). Everyone gives their answer to the person to the right of the guesser and that person mixes the answers up and then reads them aloud (without telling who's answer it is). Then the guesser has to guess who's answer it is. For every answer that the guesser chooses the correct answerer he/she moves forward one space.The answers can be as real or as goofy as you like. We like to mix it up. It makes them more fun.The only thing that would make this more fun is if there was a refill deck of cards since we have done most of the questions."
1,Bad game - annoying questions that no one cared about,"I got this game to play with friends when they visit. We played this one time...and hated it. It wasn't fun, and it was annoying to answer the questions. The questions were dumb and if you know the people you're playing with, it's way too easy to guess who wrote them. If you like games that ""break the ice"" then maybe this is a good game for you, but it was just kind of dumb trying to pretend you cared enough to answer the questions. Returned it after 1 play."
1,Terribly Boring!!!,"Got this game in the hopes that it would be as much fun as ""Apples."" Although the instructions are simple enough, as we played, we all thought that we were missing something... there really was no surprise, laughter or enjoyment produced from the ""crazy"" questions presented in the game. (nothing to really consider ""loaded!"" more like mundane) Perhaps the adult version was more of what i was looking for to spark a night of interesting conversation but since this was so lukewarm, i doubt the adult version is any more risky."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this game and thought it would great but have to agree with the other reviews - the questions fall into the who cares at allI looked through most of the cards and there were a few interesting questions - very fewDon't waste your money
4,Lots of fun with a group!,I recently purchased this game to bring on a group ski trip with friends. It was a lot of fun!! A couple of drinks makes the game even more interesting!
5,Laughed so hard...,"My family are avid board game players, and we absolutely love this game. We are a family of smart asses and it feeds right into our sense of humor. You answer the loaded questions (e.g. What is your best body part? What do you wish you never had to hear about again? What rich person do you think doesn't deserve it?) and try to guess who gave which answer. We work inside jokes into the questions and often answer sarcastically or try to throw each other off with answers we think others would give. Sometimes the person reading the answers cannot even get through them for laughing so hilariously. It depends on the group but I've nearly wet myself everytime I've played this."
4,loaded questions review,"I bought this board game to play with some other lady friends and learn about them as they learned about me and have some fun doing it. This is a really fun game, it can get a tad bit long though, and can be loads of fun if you are playing with fun people who can laugh at themselves. It definately brings up stories that have to be shared on why people wrote down the answers they did. The game isn't so much about winning as the fun you all have getting there. Both this game and ""true colors"" are great. Personally i like this a bit more tho."
3,Kind of Boring,"I was eager to play this game with friends. But after about 10 minutes, it became rather boring. Of course you can outsmart the game and throw the answers if you want to win. But then it's really not fun. Did not produce much laughter."
5,Night of laughter and TMI!!,We bought this for a get together over dinner with two other young couples like ourselves. We had such a blast playing it and it was the perfect activity for our group. The three wives all knew each other since high school but the husbands only knew each other through occasional get togethers with all three wives. I wondered if it might be too hard to play considering they didn't know each other well but it never became an issue. I highly reccomend this game!!
5,Good game,Great quality as you would expect from an official game like this. The game is very interesting and can be very revealing! Best played with more people. And don't be so serious when you play it! :D
3,Not all that fun. . .,"We played with 3 people and it is too easy. Maybe it would be better with more people, but with 3 there is a 50/50 chance of getting it right and if you know the people well, you get the right answer almost every time. This game is not that great."
2,Meh,"Played with a close group of friends, there's really nothing to the game. The object is to pose a question, and then see who would have answered it a certain way... with friends that know you well, especially in a smaller group, it's more fun to just read the cards than play the game.Seemed like a great idea, but when we sat down to play it was outright boring and predictable. For a group of people who really don't know each other at all, it could be a great way to open up and have some fun; I wouldn't recommend it for less than 4 or 6 players even then."
5,great game,My daughter received this for Christmas. She had played the game previously and had it on her wish list. It is one of her favorite games.
3,Not as good as reviews said.,This game is not for everyone. It is more for the serious board game lovers. My family and I occasionally like to get together and play some fun board games. We love the game called Say Anything. It is a lot of fun. This game is more involved and one family member commented that it took too much thinking and not enough fun. We probably won't play it again soon but it did arrive quickly and promptly.
2,"Not Bad, but not what I was Expecting","Overall ""Loaded Questions"" is not a bad game, but it lacks the type of questions I had expected. Really the game in concept and organization is fine, but some of the questions are simply boring not ""loaded"". For example: ""What kind of deodorant do you wear?"" and ""How many pairs of jeans do you own?"" would fall into the `who cares' category for me. We played the other night with friends and finally got so tired of the boring questions we started making up our own. We had a few good laughs out of the games questions, but really had fun with some seriously loaded questions. However, I would like to see a version of this game with truly loaded questions and less questions that I could care less about. I would say this game is great for early teens but lacks the punch for adults."
3,I have only played this game once with my family,and there are only three of us. I think it would be much more fun with a group of people. Not educational. Could be played with kids as young as nine as long as you just are mindful of your answers.
4,Even for non-gamesters!,"I love this game and was able to talk some non-gamesters into playing it. They all had a ball! (These were adults at a church event!) Very funny if you get people to just ""tell the truth!"""
4,Fun and always entertaining,This has been great fun when we have played with it. Great for group parties in keeping everyone involved. Does require some imagination which makes it all the more fun!
4,Lots of fun,played this game with family. It got into very funny situations and lots of fun. Simple and easy to play and understand. You could make it very personal or not.
3,Nice product,"This is a nice product. I do agree shipping seems to be overpriced, but I ordered with several other items including the bon appetite book with the 5 x 7 recipe cards, page refills and these... This item does not fit in the book. I tried too find a place that would let me know if it did or not and they are much too large. So beware when they are recommended too you as another item too buy along with the book."
2,Commercial and disappointing,"If this CD has made this fantastic quartet known to a larger number of people, then, it's fine. But what a desappointment in terms of music ! A few interresting songs, but i can't feel any great inspiration in this commercial CD poorly surfing on the ethnic wave. A shame."
3,OK CD,"Unfortunately Sofronitsky's Rachmaninov is not nearly as stellar as his Scriabin, where he really reigns supreme. This is not a must-have disc. There are far better Rachmaninov prelude & etude recordings available - and almost all with better sound! I listened to the usual suspects as well as Moiseiwitsch, Pletnev, Weissenberg, Orchinikov, et al, but my favorites are by Sokolov (he is simply the best) and Cliburn who plays Rachmaninov's solo piano work better than any Russian inlcuding Richter and that should say something.This is a Russian CD, recorded in the mid to late 40s. Sound is a 3, but some of the Lyadov recordings sound horrible and more like a 2."
2,Difficult read,"I found this to be a very difficult read for someone, like myself, who never read anything by Collette and did not really know anything about her. We chose it for our book club and most of us felt the same way. The beginning was very difficult to get through while both trying to get used to Thurman's writing style and trying to keep up with all of the people she introduces. There was no real depth behind anyone's introduction. I didn't find myself caring about what happened to anyone. Collette was not a nice person, a horrible mother and yet I felt that Thurman was trying to show her in an abused wife role which didn't really fit. I couldn't really figure her out or where she was coming from. I know this is a biography and that Thurman is just telling the facts, but I found it very challenging to read and try to make sense of all of those pieces of information."
2,Not Very Engaging,"On the strength of reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post, my book club selected this book as a must read. To a woman, we found this book difficult to plow through. Thurman is enamored of subordinate clauses, tangential references and elliptical thoughts. If she were a journalist, her editor would tell her that she buried her lead at every possible opportunity. The book club came away not giving a hoot about Collette, who her mother was or who either of them slept with. Bottom line: if you are a huge fan of Collette, this might be an interesting book. For the rest of us, it is not."
5,Superb,"Judith Thurman is an intelligent, thoughtful biographer with a superb prose style to boot. It's an extremely satisfactory biographical experience to experience Colette through Thurman's filter."
2,Writing seems tired,"In the first half the writing is abysmal, but it gets much better in the second half (despite the repetitions). In the second half Thurman glides into the smoother tone used by Francis and Gontier (another biography of Colette), whom she quotes along with myriad other authors whose ideas she uses. There is little fresh or original in this book (unless you count Thurman's opinions, which I find jarring and not always based on sound evidence). As you can tell, I wish I'd got this book at the library."
4,Colette's life is fascinating,"Colette's life makes this a 4 star , she is so interesting that I have to recommened this book. I found it a good read."
1,Not a very engaging book,"On the strength of reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post, my book club selected this book as a must read. To a woman, we found this book difficult to plow through. Thurman is enamored of subordinate clauses, tangential references and elliptical thoughts. If she were a journalist, her editor would tell her that she buried her lead at every possible opportunity. The book club came away not giving a hoot about Collette, who her mother was or who either of them slept with. Bottom line: if you are a huge fan of Collette, this might be an interesting book. For the rest of us, it is not."
3,"Well written, and it held my interest, but.......","The farther into this book I got, the more I got the very strong feeling that at some point in her research and writing, the author came to intensely dislike Colette, particularly in her roles as daughter, wife, and mother. And after reading the book I came to dislike her too, which is a shame. I also didn't appreciate what I think was almost condemnation on Thurman's part--almost as though she thought Colette didn't deserve the respect and accolades she received throughout her life and after her death, because she was a neglectful daughter, an unfaithful wife, and a truly awful mother. Maybe, maybe not.Colette was a favorite author of mine, 25 years ago or so while I was in high school and college. I knew many of the details of her personal life from what little biographical information I could find at that time, but not this much. Perhaps ignorance is bliss! C'est la vie."
5,Great practical as well as theoretical book.,"This book is incredible. It is done in such a logical manner and helps you develop your skills as well as help you understand a lot about music theory. I play guitar and I've bought a lot of books on music theory and developing a practice, but this is one of the best, for any instrument."
1,nothing in it,"this book is for the starters in harmony; there is no jazz here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""jim jim"" and ""first things first"", you are completely right."
4,Hauntingly sexy,"Here's an example of how an author can take a genre like gothic horror/romance and come up with a book that breaks some rules and shocks the reader. The identity of the person in the book who is able to break the spell of the man who believes (or is) the Devil is very shocking indeed.This book was very entertaining and the sexual innuendos are unusual in this genre of books in which the heroine is usually a virgin who saves herself somehow, despite the male romantic figure's efforts to save her.""The Devil on Lammas Night"" was a titilating read, making one wonder about the power of suggestion."
3,"Pem America Tamanu 4-Piece Wicker Hamper Set, Honey","I just got my honey colored wicker hamper set today. I would rate the durability and quality 3 stars. I was hoping for a better or higher quality wicker since the retail is $100. But since I got it for $19.99, it is still a good price."
5,How to analyze handwriting,This is a good book for anyone starting graphology. It's simple and accurate and you can be a fairly entertaining graphologist by the time you finish this book. Hal Falcon's experience is an important factor in determining the accuracy of analysing handwriting. I have learned much from this book for the last thirty years and what it has taught is still relevant today.
3,Not for Dollhouse Landscaping,This book deals mostly with miniature landscaping in an outdoor setting and is not very useful for landscaping a dollhouse. Many of the plants recommended are very difficult to find and require an outdoor location. Very few indoor plants are mentioned. It's a Great book for someone interested in outdoor gardening in miniature.
3,Good information that's hard to find,"An older book, nevertheless some good information not usually found in books here in the States."
3,Flash Gordon Box set 3 dvds,"I watched Flash when i was a tyke,i stayed riveted to the tv.Anything space always was watched,when i saw this onsale through amazon it was a much wanted item for me. I enjoyed rewatching them after all these some 44 years.I hope my grankids will enjoy them."
4,Flash Gordon Boxed Set Perfect for Collection,"Where would science fiction films be today if there had been no Flash Gordon comic strip or movie serial. Yeah, those rocket ships and ""Strato-Sleds"" look pretty comical shooting out sparks and sounding like over strained electric orange squeezers. But those who remember seeing Flash Gordon in the movie theaters will tell you, these serials had kids sitting on the edge of their chairs and bursting to see what was ""to be continued"" next week. I first saw my first Flash Gordon serial on T.V. in the early 1950's and I'll tell you, I found it exiting then. Now we can laugh about much of the bad acting and the ""odd"" mistakes now and then, but this is real film history folks. Check out the titles on the intro of ""Space Soldiers"" and see if you notice where George Lucas got the idea for the intro titles for his ""Star Wars"" films. I give this collection four stars for it's worth to any collection! RAM."
2,Unfortunate Packaging :(,The physical quality of this set left much to be desired. The disks are so flimsy that one cracked while being removed from the folder. One of the others was not properly inserted and was loose in the package. It was scratched and not playable. The third disk was *very* carefully removed from the holder with much caution.What I saw met my expectations but I only was able to view one of the three included DVDs. I will not buy products from this company.
4,fun tapes,Brings back many memories from both the movie house and many years later the TV. Thank you for a Fun Time
3,Flash Gordon Box Set HWK,"I loved having the complete set of the Flash Gordon Series and to watch them from beginning to end. The video portion was everything I expected. Unfortunately, the sound is of very poor quality. (I would rate this 5 stars except the sound is so poor.) I could barely hear the sound on my HD TV. I needed to pump up the sound on my sound system to get some sound. My message, you need some power to get some sound.However, once I was able to get the sound up, it was very enjoyable. It brought back memories of the Flash Gordon Show and my youth. I will keep my set.Herb"
4,Flash Gordon,Loved the serial. Its kinda hokie and definitly before my time but i totally got into it. Picture was perfect and it was fun to see what passed for science fiction in the past. thanks again
3,Cute story but awkward to read aloud,"Cute story about numbers with simple, colorful illustrations. My only problem with this book is the rhyme--reading it out loud, it's hard to find a rhythm to it, so it just feels awkward a lot of the time."
5,"GREAT, GREAT BOOK.",Absolutely loved this book - Gave it as a Christmas present to my 3 year old grandson. The story is absolutely perfect - an easy read but also has a deeper meaning. The best is the graphic design. This is definitely one of my favorites and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
5,Quality Over Quantity,"Company of Wolves' first album has been one of my favourite records for a few years now, and I was completely unaware of this 2nd studio album until I had a chance conversation with the band's singer Kyf Brewer via email. I was initially a little bit disappointed when I saw there were only 8 tracks, but after having listened to the album, I can say that whatever this album lacks in quantity, it more than makes up for in the sheer quality of the tracks. There is not one bad song on here. Too many bands put out albums with 12 - 15 tracks and half of the songs, more often than not, end up being filler. From the upbeat acoustic number ""Rocks In Your Head"" through to the excellent feel good ""Rhythm & Booze"", this album will not disappoint fans of the self titled debut."
4,Worked great price was a little high,It worked like a charm and was longer than the ones you usually find in the box stores. I would have liked the price to have been a little lower but I got my money's worth out it. It is reasonably sturdy given the compromise between weight and length that is required.
1,Total Junk,Pros: I could return it no questions asked.Cons: Pole too flimsy for use. Clips break easily.I tried working with this device for about an hour. The primary problem is the very flimsy pole that does not remain stable when extended beyond it collasped length. The clips break when bent too much. I was able to hang my lights only after I replaced their pole with a professional painter's pole that can be extended without bending or collasping. Do yourself a favor and buy just the clips and the adapter. They sell them separate because they know the pole is garbage.
4,It works.... but...,"I found this to be the solution to taking down the Christmas lights that go across the top of the house but I have not been able to put them back up that way. The reason is, the pole is much too heavy to try and hold it up as well as trying to hook the lights at the same time.After purchasing this one, I found a light-weight aluminum pole that is much easier for me to use. I suppose this would be okay for a guy with lots of strength but for a small person, it's a NO."
4,my private review mach 5,"a strange movie, based on a true story, but ended up just the same check out the movie!"
5,Anatomy of a hate crime,"When I watched this film, I was completely unprepared of what I was in for. I knew nothing about the Brandon Teena case, so watching the story unfold before my eyes was something of a shock. Hilary Swank won her well-deserved Oscar for playing a woman living as a man in rural Nebraska. She befriends two ex-cons who later strip, beat, rape, and finally murder her when they find out her true gender. It's a film that is not for all tastes, but if you can stomach the violence, then this film should be added to your ""must-see"" list."
4,Horrific and Teriffing,"When I saw a preview for this movie I not only knew I had to see it but I also had to buy it. When I saw it for the first time, I was heart-broken. This movie, although a little graphic, is a well written protrail of this girls life. It is and awsome movie if you are willing to see the truth, not the normal cover-up accepted life!!!"
5,I Never Want to Cry Like that Again,"Boys Don't Cry is a very, very painful movie to watch. I loved it, but it evoked such emotion from me...I am afraid I will never, EVER watch it again. I loved Hillary Swank in this film, and I understand why she won Best Actress. Chloe was wonderful as well. I agree with the person who wrote that Hillary was not pretending to be a boy, she was a boy. She did become Brandon. This is definitely a film that everyone should watch."
5,"A ""must-see"" movie for everyone","Reasons to see this movie: 1. Hilary Swank's performance isoutstanding. I have racked my brain thinking about the last severalyears' Oscar winners for best actress and she absolutely outshines them all, hands down. 2. It's not just a gay film, or a transsexual film, or a anti-bigotry film, although those are important elements in the film. In its own way, it's very much a love story. You can't always help who you fall in love with, regardless of sex, ( or race or religion or whatever.) It's Romeo and Juliet, it's the Crying Game, it's the Hatfield and McCoy's, it's West Side Story. As Lana finds out the truth about Brandon, she realizes that she (unlike other characters, notably Tom, John, and Lana's mother) can't just switch off the deep feelings she has for Brandon, just because it doesn't fit in with society's expectations. 3. See it and learn the lesson that we should accept our diversity and live with our differences in a humane manner."
2,Watchability,"I think Hilary Swank did an excellent job with this role. But, in my opinion, the movie seemed to be thrown together. I had heard it was a good movie and it got a B, but it didn't make a whole lot of sense. Perhaps if didn't feel so rushed, it would have been better."
2,picture was dark,"The majority of the film was dark, the scenes I especially wanted to see were very dark. My picture tube is fine, brand new TV but I will watch it again when I have nothing to do."
3,"overrated, simplistic","This was very good, for a TV movie. For a film, it was sub-par. Although fairly well acted, it was melodramatic and didn't amount to much beyond a simplistic political statement - an important political statement, yes, but a simplistic one."
4,hilary is really a beautiful wamon!!,"i only go for girls, but i am not the same kind of person like brandon. while i saw this movie, i felt his pain. he had been suffered too much during his life. i haven't got the chance to be his friend. i know i'll stand up for him no matter how bad the situation is."
2,I'm still trying to figure it out...,"More like 2.5 stars... Well... The movie had me completly lost until about the late middle of the movie. I wish they would've explained what he/she was running from in the first place, why he/she had to be in court, who the other characters were...? I can't say it was a horrible or even a bad movie. It kept my attention(a little) and touched me in a slight, saddening kind of way. I just don't think it was my ""type"" of movie..."
4,Difficult to watch,"A powerful film and Hilary Swank deserves the Oscar. No contest. Too bad Chloe Sevigny's nuanced performance wasn't recognized as well. Really tough to watch some parts of this movie. Although films about white-trash-trailer-park life are almost always unbelievable because of the attractive cast (with the exception of ""Gummo"", natch), there were many little details about this segment of society that felt authentic."
4,A Superb job by Hilary Swank!,"This movie was difficult to watch and it had a disturbing, unoriginal plot, but Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny are absolutely brilliant. Hilary Swank should have won hands down and I applaud the Academy for NOT being politically- correct and giving the coveted award to the deserving actress, Hilary Swank rather than the expected winner, Annette Bening for AMERICAN BEAUTY. As for Ms. Sevigny, she was brilliant, although one can't make a very good case for her with Angelina Jolie against her for her equally haunting performance, in GIRL INTERUPTED. Sorry Chloe, Angelina was just great. Over all, an incredibly disturbing film, which probobly should have been rated NC-17. Lastly, I congratulate the producers and financers of the film for taking a risk, and creating an exceptional film."
4,Good Film Very Intense,Hilary Swank does a Fantastic Job here.this Film started kinda slow for me but it picks around the Middle&it never lets up.it keeps your full attention on this Tragedy.this film shows what Pure Hate can Lead to.this film was well written&Directed.it stayed Focused without being overly Done.it made it's point with a Very Sad Ending.
2,Terrible ending.,"Boys Don't Cry is a cruel and violent film. Hilary Swank pulls off her best male impression but her accent and mannerisms just fall flat. I could barely see the movie, and what I mean by that is the picture quality is very dark. It was like the film was shot in complete darkness, bad lighting and cinematography. There is no happy ending and you just feel no lesson is learned, Boys Don't Cry tries to make a point but fails to deliver a hopeful message."
1,Get your facts straight,"I would just like to point out that Brandon Teena was not a butch lesbian, as some people have stated in their reviews. Brandon Teena was a F2M transgendered person who should be referred to as a he, not a she, and most definately not as a butch lesbian. If anyone was confused by his identity in the movie, I suggest you read up on transgender identities and issues before you post an ignorant review."
2,Too Violent,"When this movie first starts, it doesn't seem like it is going to be too bad; but as it progresses, it becomes worse and worse. More violent and more sexually violent. By the end, I wished I had not watched it. Hillary Swank did a tremendous acting job, but sometime I think some things are better left not done or known."
4,What are little girls made of?,"This is a gutsy portrayal of prejudice, ignorance, and intolerance among a small clique of disenfranchised white trash. The cast all perform well, especially Hilary Swank as the gender dysphoric youth, Brandon, and Peter Sarsgaad as the simmering sociopath who boils over once he discovers Brandon's secret. There's a grim inevitability to the tale as Brandon runs headlong into disaster; she ploughs on regardless of the fact that it's patently clear what will eventually happen, and this refusal to recognise her fate makes it a tad difficult to sympathise with her at times. Nonetheless, this is a sobering and harrowing take on the inability, or unwillingness, of some people to empathise with those who they perceive as different, and consequently, in their ignorance, as a threat."
4,Very Well Acted,"Hilary Swank is so believable in this movie, I kept forgetting she is really a woman. She gave an outstanding and heartbreaking performance. The director of this film really captured the ugliness of this horrible scenario that occurred in Nebraska in late 1993. In a way this movie was hard for me to watch, but it really touched me. There are two reasons I did not rate this a five star film..first, is that Philip DeVine, one of the of the actual victims of the crime, was cut entirely out of the film and never mentioned. Second, I didn't like that Lana Tisdel (portrayed by Chloe Sevigny in the film) was seen present at the murders, when in truth she was not present. Overall, a very good movie with five star performances."
4,"Strange, but good.","The story was good, but the people and the trailer park atmosphere really got on my nerves. I got the story from the beginning and was wondering about the rest, but it pulled through. I hate that it had such a tragic ending and that was heartbreaking. There were a few violent scenes so this isn't a movie for kids. But all in all the movie was pretty good."
3,"Good film, but there are issues!","Hillary Swank gives a great performance as the doomed victim, Brandon Teena. She deserved the Oscar! However, there are problems with this film. As a drama, it works well. But as a docudrama, the facts don't measure up. For starters, there were three people who were murdered that night, not two, as portrayed in the film. The third victim was Philip DeVine, a black disabled man who was staying at the house. Second, the story also doesn't explain about the two men's affilliation with a white supremacist organization. They may have been targeting both Teena or DeVine or both. The movie purpose seems like it has an ajenda towards the advancement of gay rights. If that's the case, it should have been explained in the credits at the beginning or end of the film. For those who study the case history, you'll be either disappointed in the story like myself or enthraled by it's purpose. Despite that, it's a good drama."
1,ashamed,"Okay where do I begin, First of all this movie made me feel ashamed to be a resident in the state of Nebraska. I mean seriously, do I really want the people who see this movie to think that we're all like this? NO we are not all child abusing, pot smoking, alcoholics."
1,An Exercise in Easy Self Congratrulation,"It's remarkable that one year features two Hollywood films that win all the awards yet fail to challenge the thinking of the big city people who pass them out. I didn't think a stronger exercise in big city (non-suburban) self congratulation than ""American Beauty"" existed, but I had not yet seen ""Boys Don't Cry."" Who is honestly challenged by this complacent examination of homophobia in small town, white trash America? As regards the majority of the kinds of people who will flock to such a film, isn't ""Boys Don't Cry"" banging on an already open door? There's no real conflict of views, since one side is obviously sympathetic and ""advanced,"" the other benighted and beneath contempt. Neither the skill of the acting nor the technical polish of the photography and direction can remove the inevitable boredom that always afflicts tales of Giant the Jack killer."
5,A Superior Film,"A haunting, touching film. Superb acting by Chloe Severgny (sp.) and Hillary Swank. Very convincing love story. (Which I think this movie is.) Stunning."
4,CURE ME,"BOYS DON'T CRY, director Kimberly Peirce's first movie, is a winner. The film is emotionally violent, the actors perfect and the description of a dozen characters found in a nowhere town of the U.S. frightening. Why ? because they're real, because such people can be observed anywhere in the world, in your city, in your neighborhood, in your family.For a first movie, BOYS DON'T CRY looks very professional with a clever editing, a few arty effects ( sky and lights) well integrated in the story and a sense of the rythm admirable.Great video transfer, a director'commentary, a featurette, spanish and english subtitles and a trailer.A tolerant DVD."
1,Scratched DVD,The DVD was scratched and would not play. It was a very poor quality product. I don't know if the movie is good or not since I could not see it.
5,Boys Dont Cry,"It was truly an amazing movie, very sad but it was well directed and the actors were so much like the real life people."
4,Boys Don't Cry,I thought I had already reviewed this product. Got it to be part of my movie list.I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
3,Boys don't cry,I like the acting and the story the acting you could see the actors were still learning their craft the fact it was a true story gave it more meaning to me
3,Not a very good portrait of the real Teena Brandon!,"I had found the movie a bit boring and Hillary Swank didn't fool me at all about being a boy. Maybe it's coz I have seen her before on tv as a girl and I could not think of her as a guy. I didn't thought she looklike a guy. The movie is only base on the time she was in Falls City, when she meets Lana Teisdel, her friends and when she was rape and murder. I had wish to see more about Teena life before, about her family. I don't think this movie tell the real story of Teena Brandon, it was more fiction then anything. It's not a bad movie but it's not also a good one!"
4,"SAD, COPELLING TALE","Teena Brandon was one mentally screwed up girl. From her wrestling with her sexuality (denying she was a lesbian) and her self-destructive reckless attitude towards the law. Hillary Swank gives a very brave performance which as tragic as the character is, it's a refreshing change from the cliched ""TOOTSIEish"" portrayals of people who may ot seem a part of ""everyday"" society. I personally think Swank still looked rather feminine, but, hey, she IS a woman! Her Nebraska accent and mannerisms are excellent. Chloe Sevigny gives an equally brave performance in her own right as the object of Swank's affections. This film will propel both to the forefront in Hollywood-at least it SHOULD. What a 180 degree turn from ""the Next Karate Kid"" for Swank! Too bad the film distributor, Fox Searchlight, seemed too timid to release this excellent film to a wider audience. Oh well, I guess that's why video was created."
2,This Boy Cried...,"... and not because of the tragedy depicted. This film stirred nothing but fear in my heart. By the end of the dizzying experience that was 'Boys Don't Cry' - I could only wonder how the Academy found any part of it worthy of an Oscar.Though Hillary Swank is convincing as Brandon/Teena, the circustances of the character are all too pathetic to make a true connection.It seems everyone behind this film had an ""agenda"" with the American public. ""Hate is alive and well in America""... hmmm, I guess we didn't know that. What is even worse is that it fails to deliver the message by focusing on the jealous rage of Tom over the relationship between Brandon/Teena and Lana. This film left me feeling abandoned and cold."
1,"Well Acted ""Documentary.""","Hillary Swank definetly puts in a stunning performance as a sexually confused girl trying to masquerade as a boy. The raw emotion that drips from her character you could almost grab in your hand. However, if you want entertainment, this movie is not for you. The graphic (and I mean graphic) violence only serves to illustrate the hatefulness and intolerance of society for people having a sexual identity crisis. The rest is just backdrop."
1,LOOK FOR ANOTHER SALER,"BY THE WAY AWESOME MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IT PLENTY TIMES, BUT DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND GO TO WALMART OR TARGET TO GET IT. I ORDERED THE MOVIE AFTER A MONTH OF NOT RECIEVING ANYTHING FINALLY CONTACTED THE SALER, NEVER GOT A TRACKING # NO NOTHING ALL THEY HAD TO SAY WAS WERE NOT HERE TO TAKE PPL MONEY ""WHAT"" well cleary you did after back and forth emails I just wanted my money after 2weeks I finally got my refund, actually had nerves to offer a comp movie and to no surprise I never herd nor did nothin ever come these ppl are a joke in this case save your self a headache n juz go to the store"
3,Why Does TI Continue to Needle HP By making calculators,"In a Nutshell, look, TI is of course a fine company, well meaning, and surely ""no"" Enron!! Yet, I ask myself, why do they continue to manufacture financial calculators, calculators which, though I suppose well meant are surely outclassed by the HPs! Everyone has their nitch, I suppose, but in the area of financial calculators I suggest that TI stop bleminishing their otherwise good name and just defer to HP where financial calcularors are involved.Ever have keys repeat on your HP? Tragically, you just cannot put full confidence in the TIs due to their problems in this area. To that I would add that it is more difficult to use the TI than the HP.Hey, TI, you are great in your areas but... it in and get out of financial calculators!!""A friend""!"
2,Worn out and thrown out,"This calculator was very easy to learn how to use and was inexpensive. The problem however was that you had to press the keys ""dead center"". Any deflection on any key stroke would not give a result. This got old very quickly. After 6 months of use no amount of care in pressing the keys would allow a valid calculation.This time I'll try HP."
1,bad buy,"I am disappointed in the product as it is a Texas Instruments BAII Plus not the Real Estate mortgage calculator that is on the screen now nor the one advertised, or the one I needed. I doubt very much that I will buy anything used this way again."
1,Not what I expected,"I had been using Maguires vinyl protectant on my cars' vinyl top and thought it was all right, but I needed to re-apply every week to keep up the good look. I tried this product in hopes of having the top looking better longer, but that is not what I got. The top looks okay, but it doesn't quite have that look that Maguire's gives, and I still find myself re-applying it often. I guess I have to keep looking for that one product that will give a good, long-lasting look (even if long-lasting is 2 weeks).In an experiment, I did half my roof with Maguires and half with Eagle One, the Maguires lasted more than twice as long than the Eagle One. Next I will try it against Nu-Vinyl, which I will get in my next order from here."
5,Thanks Paul!,"What a DVD! Seriously, this is one of the best and most emotional rock performances I have ever seen! Paul out does himself and give so much. There are some incredible moments. I've Got a Feeling is so raw and Paul plays some great licks on the electric. Another that totally left me in awe was She's Leaving Home! Not one of my favs from Pepper, but live it takes on a whole new dimension! It is flawless and the harmonies are sublime. I love how the camera roves through the audience and you see the emotional responses from the fans. Tears, smiles, and just good 'ole boogying! Another classic that sounds so much better was Let Em In! Fantastic. It also must be said that Paul's voice is the best I have heard live! His band is phenominal and you can tell they are fans and put their heart into the playing. The back-up harmonies echo The Beatles...all in all a can't miss DVD! GET IT! AND GET BACK!"
5,McCartney - Post Glasnost,"As McCartney said, his parents ""Would NEVER believe we performed R&R; in the former Soviet Union."" Do you remember watching the TV clip of Kruschev banging his shoe on the UN podium? Did you hear the term Glasnost, Gorbavhev's policy of publicity and openness? Now you see your life-long musical idol performing behind what was formerly The Iron Curtain. How cool!Watch the faces of the audience young and older get in the groove. In the 60s and 70s many of them smuggled and listened to the Beatles and secretly celebrated their birthdays in St. Petersburg. Now see your favorite songs performed by Macca in DVD format with the Kremlin and the turreted buildings you only saw in textbooks come alive. A definite Yeah Yeah Yeah Experience. Thanks for taking us along for the ride, Paul."
4,Very Good but could have been Great,"There are some great performances by Macca on this DVD, but unfortunately the feel for the concert is somewhat disrupted by the interjection of the documentary commentary. The documentary is good but I feel should be totally separate from the concert footage.The one thing I found very frustrating is the sound quality on the bonus concert in St Petersburg. It is terrible, the sound fades in and out & is of a very low quality. It maybe that I have a faulty DVD, but I fouund the sound quality of the Red Square concert to be good. Strange.The above aspects detract from what would otherwise have been a great DVD."
4,Rock in Red,"This is a very interesting DVD, besides the music that is excelent, it's a social document about the influence of the Beatles in the falling of the former U.S.S.R. It's amazing to watch President Putin in first row enjoying (but not showing it) the concert or hearing the Minister of Defense saying how proud he was when he could get the LP Beatles collection. I really enjoyed the music selection, the sound is very good and no doubt, the Red Square rocked that night in 2003. Paul keeps alive the Beatles heritage."
2,Awful Sound quality,I was so looking forward to watching this... for the Beatles songs and Paul's own. I was very disappointed by the sound quality. Lots of fading and drop outs. Probably caused in part by all the cutting and editing. I too wish it was just music. Please remaster the sound!
5,McCartney at his BEST,If your foot isn't tappin' throughout this DVD then you must be deaf. Not only is the music great but the commentary regarding the effect on the young '60s population and its role in the fall of Communism is eye opening to say the least. Add to that all the great pictures of beautiful Russian architecture and this is a MUST SEE for everyone!
5,Paul Rocks!,"Saw Paul McCartney in concert a few years ago, and it was every bit as good as this DVD! Great sound, good camera work, and of course, interviews mixed in with concert footage to really put it in perspective.. Think about it. A Rock and Roll concert in Moscow, by an Artist who was banned at the the time he became popular with the Beatles. It doesn't get much better than this if you like music!"
3,"Video pains, but music and story good.","I have to agree with Mauricio on the fact that the video editing was very poorly done, if it was that good. I know they wanted to show the Russian audience reacting to the music, but that didn't have to be in 1 to 2 second shots.The storyline, interviews and music was great."
2,Worst actual concert footage I've ever seen,"The directors predilection for 2-3 second ""swooping"" camera cuts make the actual concert footage almost un-watchable. Show the artist, who cares about the crowd?"
1,who is the idiot behind producing this DVD?,"This DVD is simply unwatchable. I can't see why there are so many good reviews. There is not a single scene that stays for more than 3-4 seconds. The scenes keep on switching frantically and in a irritant way! The sound quality is not good; the crowd is too noisy and the volume keeps going up and down. I am dissappointed in this DVD, and I don't recommend it. Oh, I forgot! every few songs, you get some documentary!! This is a DVD that is certainly not enjoyable."
2,Worst concert DVD I own.,I own about 40 various concert DVD's and must say this is about the worst of the lot. The reason - the concert footage is almost unwatchable. I can't for the life of me understand why they felt the need to change camera shots every 1 or 2 seconds (you get 3 seconds if your lucky) but that's they way they put this together. I actually counted the number of changes over the course of 1 minute during the performance of Jet and it was 51. 51 camera changes in 60 seconds of footage - you do the math on that.It's really a shame too because the concerts really seem to be excellent. Paul has a great backing band and the songs sound fresh and filled with energy. In the end it doesn't matter as it's not possible to sit down and enjoy watching it.
3,"Good Show, mediocre sound and visuals","Quite Simply this is a very fine spirited performance by Paul and his very good back up band. The Russian audience is most appreciative and enthusiastic. The draw back for me personally was the constant camera changes from band members to audience. It was enough to tire me out to the point I had to stop the show. Another weakness is the mediocre picture and sound quality. Not up to DVD standards and really shows on high def and dolby digital surround sound. The DTS sound option is actually poor at least on my system. Overall though due to the great musician performances, it is worth the purchase price."
1,Save Your Money - The Worst Concert DVD Ever!,"This DVD should be called "" A LOOK AT A RUSSIAN CONCERT AUDIENCE WITH BACKGROUND MUSIC BY PAUL McCARTNEY"". It is the poorest edited concert DVD ever, with more shots of the people in Red Square than of the band on stage. The relatively few shots of Macca and the band are too short and are quickly cut to either the over used boom camera, another shot of the audience, or another quick shot of a band member.Originally broadcast on A&E; Networks, this is more of a documantary about east-meets-western culture than it is about the music. I turned it off after three songs. You will, too."
4,Paul McCartney - Live In Red Square,"Sir Paul provided an outstanding performance - his voice is as good as ever, jam packed with great sound and energy. The only downside to the DVD was a little too much time spent touring around Moscow. Some of it was interesting,some was too drawnout and uninteresting. A great job overall on this video, I especially enjoyed the back referencesto the Beatles."
2,Another Mark Haefeli edited disaster DVD,"Like some other reviewers said, great music, great scenery, great everything, except for the 15 to 20 frame (less than a second) constant jump cut editing by Mark Haefeli that makes the video unwatchable. Watch a strobe light blinking for 2 hours and you get the idea. When you have absolutely no talent for editing video, you dump every damned unrelated shot at the viewer so fast that the audience sees nothing but a blur of crap.If I could get my money back for this piece of Wayne's World schlock editing, I would. If you see anything directed or edited by Mark Haefeli, save your money. The guy has less than zero talent.If they would just release the music on CD, buy it. The video is a total waste."
2,A documentary NOT a music video!,"Someone somewhere obviously said ""OOOOH we don't want just an ordinary boring old music video do we?"" NOOOO We must place in historical context! Great! Let's get the HISTORY CHANNEL in and RAMBLE ON AND ON AND ON about how the Beatles provided hope to the Russians! ZZZZZZZZZ. This DVD is really a documentary with music added on- the chapters annoyingly don't link to the start of each song and you often can't tell when the song has started as you have scenes of Russian life instead of Mr. McCartney on stage (so you can't just scroll through to find the start of the song). If that wasn't bad enough they interrupt ""the Fool on the Hill"" with historical commentary. Unfortunately the history gets more attention on this DVD than the music. 2 stars"
4,Not bad but...,Not a bad collection of Funk jams but it features mostly cuts from the Stone Jam album which was recently re-released. Now if they would just re-release Showtime I'd buy two copies of it. Showtime was Slave's best album and is not as well represented here as it should be. But Slave is so good and so important in the history of Funk music that I still give this best of collection four stars.
3,Gary Hoyt,Wasn't to hot on this DVD. Story lines weren't the greatest and for some reason the cameraman goes up down left right at high rates of speed almost making you dizzy trying to keep up with the changing (too rapidly)scenes. My choose is Hill St. Blues over NYPD.
4,Still good -but not as good without David Caruso,"N.Y.P.D. Blue Season 2 is still a good show without David Caruso but it lacks the magic sparkle that the 1st season has. There are many guest stars who went on to become big stars : Michael Imperioli ( 'Christopher' on ""The Soprano's ),Peter Boyle ( the monster in ""Young Frankenstein"" movie)and more guest stars- but without David Caruso's character providing the sexy romantic luster =this is just a good cop show. How they thought that the high pitched voice and dull lack of appeal of Jimmy Smits could ever replace Caruso is a big unanswered question. If you want to see why this program became a hit- buy Season 1. If you want to just see a good police program with good guest stars- this is your season to buy on dvd."
5,Why didn't I watch this show in 1994,"Season two is just as good as season. I never watched the show and realize now what I have been missing. Several powerful episodes. Sipowitz is a great charecter and Simone comes out strong. I was worried when Kelly keft the show, but Simone is a better, more well rounded charecter."
4,Very Interesting series,"I purchased this DVD because of David Caruso who starred in its first season. Then when I got into it I had to have the other seasons as well. It is a well written and very well acted series. Pretty raw for the 90s when it was shown, but tame by todays standards.I just wonder IF New York city is that conjested and crowded, the 15th precinct shows a down and dirty part of the city. I enjoy the series, but sorry NY is a place I would definately wouldn't want to live."
1,NYPD Blue Season 2,I must have recieved some very poor quality discs. Won't play in several drives. The drives it will play in is the worst quality I've seen.
5,Great Series,"This is the second season of NYPD BLUE in which they change main characters, from John Kelley played by David Caruso, to Bobby Simone played by Jimmy Smits. The show is very well written and directed, the cinematography is also excellent. The acting I believe is superb; their cast is great. It's also really nice not to have the annoying commercials. That being said, however this is a show for adults."
4,"Transitional ""Blue""","""NYPD Blue"" never fully recovered from the abrupt exit of David Caruso in Season Two (1994-95). Despite his solid performance as Bobby Simone, it was impossible for Jimmy Smits to fill the void created by Caruso's departure. Nevertheless, Dennis Franz's complex portrayal of Andy Sipowicz remained integral to the series - thanks to the guiding hand of creators Steven Bochco and David Milch. The six-DVD set is worth having for the final Caruso episodes and the evolving chemistry between Franz and Smits. However, the dramatic uniqueness of ""NYPD Blue"" was dead and gone after Detective John Kelly left the 15th Precinct."
4,good book but only decent translation,"I happen to know that this book is extremely hilarious in the original Polish. The english translation is not bad, but somehow doesn't capture the heavily language based humor. The thought provoking stories are still there, so it's a decent book for all that."
5,Way Cool,"This is one of the great collection of SciFi shorts of all time. Yes Joe, the 20th & 21st voyage drag on too long. But no one should miss the 7th & 28th voyages. Lem examined, with humor and insight, some futurological problem WAY ahead of his time."
2,skip this one,"Possibly Lem's worst novel. A lot of bad ideas mixed with his obsessiveness led to the worst collection of short stories imaginable. Cheap humor, unimaginative and predictable storylines... a couple of stories were alright, but by the time I finished the book I'd forgotten about them; the 20th and 21st are just dreadful. Skip this one."
1,WORST BEST OF TITLE......,"this cd advertises as having 80 some odd tracks...but what they fail to mention is that it's only ""about"" 2 minutes per song. What a ripoff! talk about misleading advertising! the album is one continuous mix...of 2 minute songs.....and you hear dj honda's name being shouted out wayyyyyy tooooo many times. i like some of honda's music (H III), but this album was just a disappointment. i threw it out the same day that i listened to it. if you like honda's music, you're better off buying the original albums. don't waste your money here."
1,Very Disappointed,I tried this scent and attempted to wear it a few times but it's too strong. It's not a heavy smell but it's way to piercing to the nose. Sorta like Tommy Girl...that stuff just makes me sneeze. I first smelled it on a woman at a job interview and it smelled great! I ran out and bought it and it was a huge let down.
4,I remember !!!!,Sho nuff..i remember this too..To me these were the last true days RE was still Thumpin..cause EU and Chuck was on Top..Junkyard was really comin through then but u cant forget Benny and the Masters.who was just GROOVIN!!!!Ayre Rayde and Class had dropped a bit..Hot Cold Sweat was on the one too..and Reality had won of the best pockets ever...
1,A REAL LITTLE STINKER!,Is this the same composer who wrote Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer? You've got to be kidding! A album of new-age ditties.
2,fell apart,"The concept is great and I used them on 1 trip, but after opening and closing twice during the trip, the seams came apart so the compression aspect was lost."
1,Buyer beware,"OVer priced, can get equal product at local stores that will do the same for half the price.This product is way over priced and the functionality is still in question, I will know more after my trip."
4,"Great Idea, but...","Great idea. Bright colors, good variety of fish. Wood pieces are very sturdy and the ""fishing pole"" has survived being stepped on many times, used as a bat, and being thrown on the floor. It's a big hit with all the children for a few minutes, but frustration causes them to lose interest.The biggest frustration with this toy is how difficult it is to ""catch"" a fish. The magnets are small and don't attract very well. The ""string"" swings wildly with each small movement. Children learned quickly to manually place the magnet ""hook"" onto the fish magnet, but that's not the idea of the puzzle.The educational value of this toy would be increased if it identified the fish and perhaps included some details about the individual fish or the aquatic life in general."
4,Beautifully colored and sturdy puzzle,"I bought this puzzle for my son's 3rd birthday. The magnetic fishing rod gives this puzzle the extra kick. My son likes playing with it, and that's the number one reason I rated this toy highly (I gave 4 stars for the eduational value because it helps developing a little kid's motor skills: fishing the pieces with a magnet rod is not as easy as it might seem to an adult). In addition, the puzzle is well designed and manufactured in sturdy wood. I would buy it again!"
5,hand eye control,"I have an autistic son who is 5 and he loves this puzzle. As other reviewers have already said most of the good things about this...I just wanted to add that it is also good for the challenged kids out there. Not too tough and the colors and the fishing pole make it great for role play. Also, stands up to tough use...which my kiddos hand out. We also have th bug version...it is also great."
5,Fun and durable,"This was the first puzzle I ever put down in front of my son (he was under 2 at the time) and almost 4 years later he still loves it. In fact all of his friends do. It's really lasted. It's also a fun way to teach the names of various sea creatures. The pole part of the fishing pole got lost, so now we just use the string with the magnet. This puzzle is worth the money."
5,The Old One's Are the Best,"This game really is a golden oldie, but none the worse because of that. If you want to tempt the kids away from the TV or the computer for an hour this is the ideal game.It is addictive and all the family can join in, something that many families seem to have lost the knack of doing.It is a game for young and old and lots of fun and helps younger children with their hand and eye co-ordination."
4,a fun puzzle game,I love this puzzle game but I think the recommended age is incorrect. My two-year-old daughter already mastered this game in less than 30 mins and now the puzzle is sitting underneath all her children books.
5,They need to go international. They are the best,"My wife and I have used these for years. I just wish they had them for other countries too. We've used the Michelin books and others, but they aren't as good because the scale is better. They are large books, but flat (18X12 inches). They wind up in my duffel bag as they can bend. I bought this one for a friend of mine coming to visit so he and his family could plan their vacation. It lists historic sites, natural scenes, camping places, etc. The maps show lighthouses which is really good as I photograph them and more importantly how to get there. They can be used with GPS though I am of the old school and have never found a real need for a GPS device. These map books and the human brain are adequate so far."
3,Topo with clear elevation lines,I purchased the maps so I could see the elevation contours. I have a Tennessee maps and it gives the elevation changes by 100 foot. The map gives some elevation but not the contours.
3,Not what I expected,The sectioning of Arizona in this atlas was not what I expected and I had to resort to an old US atlas which showed the all at once state and major routes.
4,"Yeah, the sound is not 100%, but this is a great album","This is a great album, one that is often overlooked by folks who came to Heard's music later. Worth buying and having, even if the production is not as good as it could be. You'd grab a bootleg of a great concert, right? Sound quality is better than that, and this is some great stuff. He Will Listen To You is what fifty others have tried to write but couldn't."
1,Poor Shock quality,"I purchased these Monroe MA765 air shock for a 2001 Jeep Cherokee back in August of 2010. They were installed for about 3-1/2 months, maybe 1500 miles. Both of the shocks lost compression and rebound dampening so I removed them to see why. They held air pressure but both were leaking shock oil. I have no idea why, so I contacted the Warranty Department / Tenneco, One International Drive, Monroe, MI 48161, (734) 384-7898. I was told that these shocks carry NO WARRANTY. None, zero, not a 30 day, nothing. I was a bit surprised and disappointed. This may have been a flute that the shocks failed but the failure to warranty a product or at the very least allow for the product to be returned for inspection to determine why they failed in such a short period is inexcusable. Thanks for listening."
4,On Watch,This watch is very stylish. I love the look of it and have always enjoyed the Indiglo feature of Timex watches. It makes it easy to read in the dark. My only negative is that it is a bit hard to tell the time on due to its elongated face. You have to stare at it a second or two longer to tell the time. I would buy another one though because I like the look of it and it fits a larger wrist nicely due to the longer face.
2,Disappointing,"The formatting on this product prevented me from reading the actual music so I found it rather disappointing. It may have been just my device, though I rather doubt it."
2,Product needs improvement.,The printing was very small and unreadable for my old eyes. There is a large border that should be eliminated. Looks like a picture was taken of the pages with no attention to scaling and cropping.
5,Evil Comes Home,I saw the fog a few weeks ago and thought Jamie was good in it. I only saw the first Halloween but I can tell this is a good movie to see on halloween. So I advise you so board up your windows and doors and get on a comfortable couch and get ready to get sacred out of your life.
2,"Horrible.... Well, the first 10 minutes were OK...","The best part about this movie was the opening credits, and the first 10 minutes. The ending was gad awful, it was like a cheesy Friday the 13th movie. That's what I loved about Halloween 1 is that it is so far beyond that. This movie was a disgrace to the Halloween franchise. I wish Moustapha Akkad knew alittle something about the Halloween movies, and alittle more than the fact that they bring in money. I think Donald Pleasence is rolling over in his grave every time the movie plays. This movie made Michael Myers a ghetto joke. It was horrible. And I love Michael Myers, but buddy, it's time to throw in the butcher knife. Although, on a positive note, Cinema Secrets created the best Michael Myers mask since H2. And the one released to the mass market 'ain't too shabby either..."
2,this is a really bad movie,the first halloween is a classic and is one of the best films this is not a good sequel some fun parts but only if youre a hoorror fan i will recomened this but i say if you hav not seen the first halloween you should see it
2,A Waste Of Time And Money,"Do not bother with this one. There are so many good movies. This is probably the worst entry in the Halloween series. It is stupid, sick and has no redeeming value. Even if you like horror movies, this movie is not for you. It is a bad horror movie with poor writing and poor direction. Some studios will do anything to make money. Sad!Drama/Horror (AMC 344/3)"
1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! One word sums it up...,"...but i'll write more about how ill this movie made me. I love scary movies. I grew up on them and the first Halloween is a classic and a favorite. Even the sequels, parts 4 and 5 stand out, but this one just plain ...! I liked the fact that Jamie Lee was brought back for this, but the movie went downhill from there. The movie has a horrible script, horrible acting, horrible plot and it was very predictable. I don't look for substance when it comes to horror movies, but I at least want to be scared. I saw this in a theater and I didn't even jump with any of the murder scenes because you could tell when someone was about to get killed. If you're a horror fan you'll probably end up watching the movie anyway, but save your money and just rent it."
2,"""Blair Witch"" meets ""The Ghost & Mr. Chicken"" = Halloween 8","Remember ""The Blair Witch Project""? How about ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken""? Well, blend them together, add a few nods to other movies (e.g., ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") and you've got a mediocre pile of dung called ""Halloween-Resurrection""."
2,"Please, make it STOP","Wow, now Myers has survived decapitation. And he ""allegedly"" kills Jaime Lee at the beginning. Then some REALLY STUPID kids decide on the worst bad idea in the history of bad ideas: ""Let's hold an internet chat in the old Myers House on Halloween!"" Then of course, Mikey comes back home to kill some more people. Let's see how people escape THIS one!!! If I gave a...how the Hell anyone lives, I'd go see it opening day. But it can wait for the cheap theatre."
3,A fair effort,"Taking in mind that this is the eigth sequel in the ""Halloween"" series and the fact that it is directed by Rosenthal of ""Halloween II"" fame, this is certainly a good effort. The set pieces in the Myers' house are wonderful, with a nice attention to detail and finally breaking the dense continuity that we have seen in the ""look"" of the Myers' house in the previous sequels. The lighting (or lack of) is perfect. The elements the film lacks is orginality and a suitable plot. Although the acting isn't that bad. At least this series doesn't go to the rather desperate and cliched attempts of making a sequel funny for the sake of it, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels for example."
3,Not as bad as people make it out to be,"Okay, the movie is called Halloween:Ressurection for crying out loud, so i didnt expect to see some Shakespearean masterpeice last July. But I must say I was pleasently surprised by this 6th sequel. (Im not counting the Myer-less part 3) The web cam gimmick worked, the cast- while not that terribly bright or developed were more tolaerable than the the ones from 5 and 6, and Uncle Mike was one mean mofo in this entry. He had more aggresion in him i havent seen since part 2. Rosenthal surpassed all the sequels, except for pt 4 with this one. It was awesome. PS for the dreaded pt 9, tell Busta Bust to stay home."
2,Why?,"Why was this even made? I am a HUGE fan of the franchise and I'm sad to say this is a part of it. The only good part is the first 20 minutes or so. And why is Laurie a cameo? Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing in all the Halloween movies she was in, why would she only be a cameo in this one? Another thing is that this movie hardly has anything to do with the storyline that was well developed. I would of been perfectly fine if Michael would have died at the end of H20...but they need to get more money and go make a pointless sequel. This is by far the worst of the franchise and I'm glad Rob Zombie saved the franchise before we had a Halloween 9...god only knows how bad that would of been."
3,"""Unnecessary, But Watchable Sequel!""","Bianca Kajlich, Busta Rhymes, Tyra Banks and Jamie Lee Curtisstar in this 2002 horror sequel. Michael Myers stalks a groupof teens spending the night in his home for a reality tv show.Though this sequel could've been better and was unnecessary,It's still watchable. This dvd has nice picture and sound plussome neat extras. I'd probably still add this to your Halloweencollection."
1,90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.,"90 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Starring Busta Rhymes in the Rapper-Exchange program, since LL Cool J couldn't make it from the last picture.I'll spoil it for you and save you seven dollars.Michael Myers isn't resurrected. They change the ending of the last film to say he never really died.Jamie Lee Curtis is in the first 10 minutes of the film; the only part of the film worth watching. But by the end, you're hoping Michael Myers will come and kill you, just so you don't have to watch this movie anymore.* * * * * * * * * *Rating: F ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +F.Y.I.: ""Paul"" the weasel of the four friends from the American Pie movies is in it. And dies. So that's the 'plus.'"
1,They should have stopped while they were still a HEAD.,"Or better yet, just stopped after the first. The original Halloween is a horror masterpiece that had some of the scariest scenes in horror film history. A few of the sequels actually managed to barely pull off a couple genuine thrills while others tended to be just downright bad. This one, by far, is the absolute lowest and WORST. The whole premise is just terrible. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague."
1,LAUGHABLE JOKE OF A FILM!,"This was just a stupid idea for a film! No talent actors and actresses, lame storyline, ridiculous ""scares"". This movie is so bad it's funny! Rent it and laugh for yourself!"
2,Resurrection,I thought the movie was OK but I diss liked the fact that they killed off Jamie Lee Curtis in like the first 10 min. She has Survived all of the other ones and in this one they killed her right away. They could have waited untill the end but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
1,"STUPID, Stupid, stupid...(ZERO stars)","One word describes this movie: DUMB. Or STUPID. You could also call it boring and not-scary-at-all. Oh, and It' also cheesy. Halloween 6 is better than this! NOT Reccomended!!! STAY away from it!!!"
4,halloween resurrection,"HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION IN MY OPINION IS A GREAT MOVIE .I THINK IT'S THE BEST HALLOWEEN SINCE 1,2 .THE SCARES KEEP COMING. ITS GOT A GOOD PLOT. HALLOWEEN H20 AND RESURRECTIONHAS A BETTER STORYLINE THAN HALLOWEEN4-6 I WAS SICK OF THAT THORNSTUFF . HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION IS THE ONLY HALLOWEEN FILM THAT SCARED ME SINCE 1 AND 2 I HOPE THEY HAVE ANOTHER HALLOWEEN MOVIEIN THE NEAR FUTURE AND I HOPE THEY GO BACK TO JOHN STRODE .AND IF THEY DO HAVE ANOTHER MOVIE IT SHOULD BE IN HADDONFIELD WITH MICHAEL MYERS. IF YOU DIDNT SEE THIS MOVIEGO OUT AND RENT OR BUY IT"
2,Busta Rhymes is an insult to Halloween,"This movie was terrible. I thought Busta Rhymes completely ruined the movie with his beyond terrible acting. The first 15 minutes of the movie was worth seeing it though. If your a true horror movie and halloween fan, then prepare to be disappointed. The movie was way too predictable and I just couldnt take busta seriously"
5,"Classic Slasher Michael *Kills Told, No Names Of Who*","Michael Myers, serial killer since the late seventies, is back even though he's gotta be like 44 whomping years old. Yet, never the less, Michael happens to find out there's a broadcast in his old home, and he returns to his roots. Freddie, the main man of the project, sends six possible deaths to arouse, if not more. Upon the night, murders happen, and not much story involved. Go especially if you like ""slashing""..."
2,Better go see it in the theatres if you want it to scare you,"The only thing that made this film scary was the loud surrond sound in the theatre. Without telling the whole storyline, I will just say yes, there will be another sequal because he does not get killed. None of the original soundtrack is used in this sequal except for the main theme of course. I was not at all afraid of the shape in this one. I did like how they connected the storyline from H2O to the film, and how they used all the modern technology throught the film like the internet, those little cameras, and a pocket pilot."
2,"Not suspenseful, not inventive","I can only judge this movie based on its own merits, as I haven't seen the others in the series.Very little scared me in this movie. From the first murder to the final ""surprise"", there is no inventiveness or suspense. In a horror film, the terror comes not from the violence and gore, but from the unexpectedness of it, and the novelty in how it's done. None of the victims died in novel ways, nor did they escape in novel ways. The appearance of Michael Myers was never a shock, never a surprise, and the end of the film is as predictable as they come.My only kudos go out to Busta Rhymes, who brought a touch of humor and originality and camp, not taking his role TOO seriously, making me laugh and scream in delight."
2,so so tired of this,Man what is this halloween 25 now or something. Anyway I am a fan of the first 2 films but they just kept going and going. H20 was bad enough. I will say this one was a little better but not much. The death scence where old and predictable. The use of shadows and music where lackluster. lets face it michial myers just isnt scarry anymore since the 78 and 81 movies. It just never has gotten its flare back. I had to see it just becuse I knew it would suck plus im a film student and I went to study it. The camera effects on the kids in the house was not a new good idea I thik it disteracs from the film. Hollywood we dont want flashy camera filters on our horror movies. Givn it works for some but not for this move. It should of been shot on gritty film (not quility) With more lighting effects and better background music. Thats it.
3,not really scary,when i watched the movie the movie was funny but donna's death squirmed me so i say this movies is instead of horror its thriller and romance and adventure who wrote the script tried to make it scary well they fail so i think its not worth to buy this movie some people say bring jamie lee curtis SHE IS TOO OLD DID YOU NOTICES THIS THAT did you see her movies look at her look at her wrinkley skin i mean people give her a break she is probally about to be 62 and she is older than my dad and she retired look guy please some one comment what has to end has to end like Lost the tv show ended 2010 and Teen Titans ended 2006.so probally its the end of halloween even though its a dumb ending it has to end what has to end
2,well....,"This movie was only okay. Maybe worth a rent, I am a die hard fan of Halloween and I thought this movie was only okay."
2,Too many cliches,"The first minutes of the film with the final battle between Michael Myers and Laurie were the only high point of this film. After that happened, Halloween series enters the cliche zone. 2000 hasnt been very kind to any horror franchises. Its better then the Rob Zombie remake at least, PLEASE AVOID THAT MOVIE HALLOWEEN FANS! Myers was normal in this movie, the Zombie film made him look like he was on steriods. Probably an ode to the times. I love the Halloween series but I rank this as one of the worst films due to the dumb internet story line. If they ended this with the Myers-Strode finale then this movie would of been good. I know they had to film anther hour and twenty seven minutes of film though."
4,THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT,It was kind of stupid at the ending and Busta Rhimes too when he was like an ninja too. Laurie Strode And Josh Harnett where great on halloween H2O and they have been better if they both together appear inthe whole movie. This was great with Bianca Jaclish and Rian Merryman
1,What the %#@$ is this?!?!?!,All I have to say is that Busta Rhymes (main character) attached Michael Myers with Kung Fu and made the Bruce Lee sound while doing it... Thats worth at least -4 stars! Just look at the cover of the movie people! CRAP!
1,What a bunch of rubbish!,"This ENTIRE Halloween movie should have been a battle between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers.With Laurie finally putting an end to his ass once and for all! But no. Instead,she gets stabbed and killed by Michael Myers at the beginning of the movie.Now we dive into some stupid story about a bunch of bad-acting teens who spend the night in Michael Myers' old house and get hacked to death while doing it. What the hell? So Michael wins after all...and Laurie's dead??? She was the original survivor and the hero(besides Dr.Loomis) from the 1978 classic! She should have survived! Jamie Lee's character gets a huge slap in the face and gets killed off??? What a bunch of crap! Bottom line.This movie sucks! along with the other sequels(besides II) in the series.Buy the original and the second film,and don't bother with the rest....including this heap of crap!"
2,So Much Potential Wasted,"So they make a great slasher film called ""Halloween:H2O 20 Years Later"",right?What do they do next?Make a terrible sequal worse than ""Halloween:The Curse Of Michael Myers"".""Halloween:Resurrection""has one of the worst Michael Myers ever,one who can't kill a person without making loud noises(which no one seems to hear),or killing someone with something that has a camera attatched to it!"
2,The worst Halloween movie of the whole series,"The Halloween movies from the first to last just seems to get worse everytime a new one is released. The first two Halloween movies released ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween 2"" were the best of the whole series. They may even be my favorite movies of all time.Halloween Resurrection was just much different then the other Halloween movies. The movie was plain dumb. It had a horrible story line. The movie just gets more boring and boring the longer you watch it. I recommend that if you haven't seen any of the other Halloween movies you should watch them and leave this movie for the last to see."
1,Terrible horror movie.,"Michael Myers, never a charismatic guy to begin with, is stuck in yet another dull Halloween movie in this terrible excuse of a film.Jamie Lee Curtis' prologue is tame and very unoriginal. Blah.But then the rest of the movie is just as bland and boring.I was wishing for each teen in the haunted house to get taken out but sadly a few live. Each teen was dumb as hell and just as tedious. Heck, even the death scenes were lame. How many stabbings and slashings can we get? From the first to the last death scene there was not one original 'death.' No funny or witty killings like in a Jason or Freddy movie. Nothing. Blah.The only thing i really liked about this movie was Busta Rhymes, which is a scary thought. He had a few funny lines with his trademark curse (mofo) and his karate scenes were funny, though im not sure if they were intended to be comedic...Stay away from this movie as it is definitely NOT a treat."
2,movie too stupid and boring.,I dont know how they can make another Haloween sequels. most of the sequels were boring and they sucked. the plot is almost always the same too and what the hell were they thinking when they put Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks in this movie??? Horrible absoultely horrible script and movie and actors!
1,Horribly Insulting,"I cannot begin to describe how much this movie sucked. It's insulting to think they could kill off Jamie Lee Curtis the way they did - she sets up an elaborate trap for Michael and catches him and then just stands there a foot away from his arms as if he's paralyzed or something - you'd think that she would have learned something through all these years of being chased by a psychotic serial killer. STUPID! The rest of the movie is a complete joke. The acting sucks, which is easy to get past sometimes but in this film you don't give a crap about anyone. The characters are stupid. Stupid stupid stupid! By the end of the movie if you're not cheering whenever Michael kills someone there's something wrong with you. I was especially disappointed when they brought Freddy (Busta) back - he is so annoying. They should have left him dead. The movie would have been scores better if Michael had succeeded in killing EVERYONE in the house. See this only if you're in the mood to laugh..."
1,plain awful,"Worst movie ever. No wonder why they didn't make a sequel to this one. No the remake versions are not sequels. This movie was so bad, Jamie Lee Curtis wanted her character killed when she saw the script. She was only in the first few minutes of the film. The rest of the film is stupid, boring, and not scary. If you don't have this movie for the rest of your collection, don't get it. Just pretend it dosen't exist."
1,Big Disappointment!,"The whole movie was very predictable and just a typical teeny bopper date movie. They transformed a classic horror flick that actually had some meaning and a pretty ill story line. They simply replaced the ""Scream Mask"". The only reason I gave this movie 1 star was because of the first 15 min. Thats how the movie should have been!"
2,Go for the Rare uncut DVD,"Like the regular version of ""Halloween 6"" This has a lot of parts left out However there is a DVD out there of the Uncut Version called ""Halloween: The Homecoming"" wich is a better version at the beginning we get a scene where the Myers Family is having a barbecue and we see MICHAEL as a little boy with the devils eves Then it cuts to the Sanitarium with LAURIE . . . .I Have alot of the rare uncut DVDs they are not bootlegs but just hard to findThis is my Halloween SeriesHalloweenHalloween 2: Television Cut ""Rare""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael MyersHalloween 5: The Revenge of Michael MyersHalloween 6: The Origin of Michael Myers ""Rare""Halloween 7: The Revenge of Laurie Strode ""Rare""Halloween 8: The Homecoming ""Rare""Halloween 3 is stupid No Michael No Laurie No Fun"
4,This was a good addition to the Halloween Series.,"I think the should of let Laura live, but then again her sprit will always live thougout the rest of the the Halloween movies, if they make anymore.Because if it wasn't for Jamie Lee Curtis, Halloween wouldn't even exist and horror movies as we know it would be nothing but a piece of sh*t."
1,let's let this series die in piece before anymore of these sequels hurt the memory of the first and greatest halloween of all,jamie lee curtis at last has said goodbye to this series and not a moment to late. just not anything here that you haven't seen before and better. just a waste of time and our money. skip it.
3,Hallowen comes but once a year!,"This installment uses high tech gadgets and seemingly <a (...) to update the series into the new age. A troupe of want to be film students follow a director into a seemingly haunted house, none less than Michael Myers himself, to give the internet viewers a shock and study in terror.Of course the joke is on them as they unleash an age old terror to liven things up a bit. Cheeky at times but none the less effective, new audiences to this series will be amused.Somewhat imaginitave and creative, from a somewhat modern approach, the usual gore and shock techniques prevail. Not the best of the series, but well worth a view."
3,Needed a better ending,"This film can be enjoyable, if you draw the parallels to Halloween II. Resurrection, directed by the same guy who did Halloween II, plays on its predecessor by including homages to slipping on a bloodied floor and Michael ""dying"" by fire. Personally we could have used a hot tub scene as well, but that's how it goes.Anyways, this film needed a better ending. Namely, we really needed to see Busta Rhymes die! He was annoying and his kung fu schtick was embarassing."
2,Just buy the original!!!,"The original Halloween (1978), is one of the greatest and most suspenseful horror films of all time! Halloween 2 was a good sequel, and I don't even remember parts 3,4,5,and 6. However, Halloween H2O is much more suspenseful and entertaining film than Halloween Resurrection. Even Michael Myers doesn't seem to care about the element of surprising his victims in this new installment. He doesn't even stay hidden for very long, before he kills again, and again, and again! Halloween H20 was the perfect ending for this series. My wife and I were staring at each other at the end of Halloween Resurrection in disbelief that we actually sat through the whole movie. The only DVDs from this series that will be in OUR library will be the origianl Halloween and possibly H20."
3,alright,"I think Michael Meyers has reached retiration point. First off the movies Halloween 1,2 were the best, u can not beat them unless you make a movie straight about Michael Meyrs.Start from his chilh hood horror of madness. Shown him through the years of therapy and the mad man he is made out to be....I would watch the life of Michael Meyers...A man as evil and insane as he is made out to be would interest me more than the same old knife stabbing everyone in sight....."
4,ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE NEED A LITTLE WORK TO IT THOUGH,"STILL HALLOWEEN WAS BASICALLY THE TRUE SERIES THAT EVER STARTED.AND STILL IS KICKING MAJOR ....HALLOWEEN RESSURRECTION THE BEGINNING WAS GREAT BUT I THINK HE SHOULD OF GOT HER AT THE END,JUST TO MAKE IT MORE EXCITING.THE PEOPLE THAT DONT LIKE HALLOWEEN NEEDS TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT HALLOWEEN THE CURSE AND EVERYTHING ELSE.NOW IF THE MOVIE WOULD OF LAID OFF THE CAMERAS IN THE MOVIE AND MADE THE PLACE VERY SCARY LIK FOG AND CREEPY ATMOSPHERE,AND ALSO BUSTA RYMES TRYING TO BE A BAD...,BUT DONT WORRIED MICHEAL WILL GET HIM LATER.I WOULD OF GAVE IT A 5 STARS,BUT STILL IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE FOR THE HALLWOEEN FANS CANT WAIT TO BUY IT ON DVD.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.SO WHOS NEXT WELL LAURIE STRODES SON WELL......U MIGHT WANNA HIDE......YOUR NEXT"
3,hallo resur,"i enjoyed halloween resurection, i have only seen a little bit of the original halloween, and i really want to see halloween H20 i hope it is good. I cant beleive how a guy can survive a 1000 volt shock, getting hanged but its a horror film and its based on the serial killer ed gein, as well as scream and the texas chainsaw massacre. Michael Myers is a legend, and the 8 halloween movies r good, hopefully i can get the box set and watch every one, 3 ot of 5 *'s is my rating for this film."
3,original... somewhat boring,"The beginning of this movie was very original, but also somewhat confusing, it does not thouroughly explain what happened at the end of H20.Finally they killed of Jamie Lee Curtis, her part was getting old and the same thing everytime.Once the actual plotline gets started the movie starts to move farely slow, small background appearances of michael, but nothing major. Finally within the last 20 minutes of the film he starts his usual killing frenzy.The webcam aspect of the movie was extremely original, but not enough footage of the webcam was shown.Overall this movie was less than what i expected, but still entertaining when you have nothing else to do."
2,Michael Myers goes Blair Witch style...,"- I was extremly exsisted when i heard of this film, i followed the Halloween website day in and day out so i could get the latest info on the film. And finally, the time came. I could see it in the teathers... What did i get? A good cure for insomnia! This is the weakest Halloween movie of all times! The ""actor-cameras"" gives you a headache...the plot [is weak]... At least the beginning of the movie was good. If it wasent for that, the movie would recive an 1 star. The acting, music and Mikey's mask was good tough. But, the entire plot failed.... BR>Donald Pleasence rotates in the grave..."
4,HALL8WEEN:RESURRECTION,"This film wuz very good.The main character Laurie is eliminated after the fist 10 mnutes(which sux very bad) but the film is actually pretty good.Its the 4th best.In my opinion there should only be:John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN,HALLOWEEN 2,& HALLOWEEN H2O:20 Years Later.& if they made one more it could be Resrrection.The film is pretty good.I love:Freddie,Nora,& Sarah,& especially Laurie(although she dies).Well the film is great so buy it.As long as u have seen 1,2,& H2O but if you don't have 1,2,& H2O don't buy it.!Bye."
2,Disappointing after previous entry in series,"The premise seems promising at first. A group of college students is selected to act out an internet play at the home of killer Michael Myers...This Michael Myers is the deadly character who haunted previous HALLOWEEN movies and is presumed dead by the beginning of this one. The premise is not bad. And there comes a time in the movie when, hardly surprisingly, the notorius villian turns out to be alive after all. When the students discover that Myers is still alive and not only kicking but still wreaking deadly terror in the house where he grew up, things pick up a little. From there through the decently entertaining climax, the movie has the makings of a not-so-bad thriller. But the problem is in the middle, between the set-up and the climax. There it wallows in typical teen-movie cliches -- virile wisecracking males, and females who resist them in equally cliched wisecracking manner...the only memorable thing about the move is was pretty boring."
2,WHAT???,"OK not counting the fact that this is a sequal runned by no name actors and rap artists and just a suck cast, this moive SUCKED! And the reasons above only are a fraction of how many there are. They kill Laurie...hello...can the writers put two and two together and not get 5? Without Laurie, you have no HALLOWEEN anymore. Jammie Lee made this series and without her-good luck. Whats with casting Busta? Yea he can rap and stuff but he can't act at ALL!! I would compare his acting to Shaq's in KAZAAM. Come on! And what's with the stupid story line? Was'nt it made clear that when Michael Kills Laurie he would go after the rest of the famile i.e. Lauries son who we meet in H20. And who would be stupid enough to stay a night in the house after all the stories that HE CANT DIE!!!! I have no clue what writers and producers where thinking but if this is the end of the great series....what a sad way to go out...."
1,Save your money,"Halloween Resurrection? I think the title should of been Halloween desecration. The movie sinks to new lows as it travels further down the toilet after its predacessor Halloween H2O. The movie seems to be over influenced by todays genre of teen movies as it involves such teen idols as Busta (something). This is one of the movies most fatal mistakes, along with heavy script flaws, since the movie is geared more towards the famous rapper than Micheal Myers. My reccomendation for those who have seem the beginning phases of the series is to avoid this movie at any cost. For those who are new to the series, buy Halloween the first story, or if you want a fast thriller movie for the night buy this movie. Although I highly dislike this movie, newcomers who care for a one nighter will probably get there thrill because the movie would not make too much sense anyhow to those who had not seen the previous movies in the collection."
1,ONE STAR meaning Jamie Lee ---,Imagine 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' having s-e-x with theginsu-knife infomercial ... this would be their love child.
1,Most Idiotic Halloween ever.,"This has to be the dumbest Halloween movie out there. I'm sorry but the filmmakers are trying to hard and the little cameras that the people had on thier heads made the movie a little more boring. The acting was a disaster and so was the plot and the best character died in the starting when she could have just done him off. So this is my review and I hope it's helpful! That is All, Good-bye."
3,A let down after H20!,"An interesting, yet much less compelling entry into the long-running Halloween series. The Michael Meyers story goes high tech and loses something in the translation. What's next? Michael Meyers on PS2?Rental only."
2,Why Why Why !!,"Why did they have to make this movie? Halloween 7 (H20) made a perfect ending to this series.This movie gets 2 stars - 1. The first 10 minutes is kinda cool and 2. Laurie Strode and Michael Myers (It is a Halloween movie after all).The plot didn't even make sense, Michael Myers whole deal was he wanted to kill off every person in his bloodline. Halloween:Resurrection (which isn't even accurate, who's being resurrected??!!) wasn't even about killing off his extended family. Instead he's hiding in a house and picking off college students (whose screams aren't even worthy of horror movie status).Bottom Line - Watch Halloween 1,2,4,5,6 and 7, but stay away from this one ! It'll almost make you lose respect for the whole series."
2,Halloween 8,"Do not bother buying this DVD, unless you just want to own all the Halloween movies. It is the worst out of the Halloween series. I personally liked them all until this one came out. It just plain sucks. Bad Acting, Bad Storyline, Bad Score, Bad Everything. I was even ashamed of Jamie Lee Curtis's small cameo role. Bottom line this movie should be selling for $ brand new. The so called delted scenes are not complete either. They are missing the original intro to the film. So if you are buying the movie for that, don't bother."
2,I Am Deeply Dissapointed,"All i have to ask is what happened? This movie trilogy has been really good. This is really the only one that got me really dissapointed besides Halloween 5. First i think they have got a bad cast line up. My opinion i dont think Busta Rhymes was right for halloween. The story for this one is simple Michael Myers returns to his house while a live webcating base is filming their and Michael gets a little knife happy. Im not saying this whole movie is bad i liked it, but i was dissapointed in it. By my opinion the first ten minutes is good the rest are kind of bad. I think this movie was worth to check out at movies or rent at video store but it isnt worth buying. I said this before and i will say it again i think they should've stopped at H20."
2,Um...it's okay.,"I don't think that this DVD is that bad. Pretty much the only thing that I don't like about it is that it doesn't really follow the halloweeen story very well. I mean the first ten minutes are good but after that it gets a little annoying. In the rest of the movie it's about these teenagers who win a contest to spend one night in Michael myers' old house, but everything goes wrong when he shows up and starts killing everyone. I personally like teen horrer movies and if you like them too than I suggest that you try this movie out."
2,A joke comapred to the others,"This 8th installment of the Halloween series was kind of embarassing to wacth. I was really looking foward to seeing it because I've been thrilled with this series for years, but this movie was not scary at all, it was a joke! I mean, H20 was even better than this one. Not only is it stupid, it also holds the death of the Laurie Strode. Hell, without Laurie, what's the point of the series?! This series should have ended with H20, because it was predictable that future movies would be as pointless as they come, and this one was!"
1,DONT EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Im A Huge fan of the halloween series and i have to say this film is garbage, what kind of movie is this? internet horror? wtf i mean seriously having busta kill mike at the end? whats that all about!. dont even waste your money on this movie. i saw it when it first came in theaters and i laughed during the whole movie... wanna see a halloween movie worth the money? go see rob zombie's halloween atleast hes out killing again like he use to"
4,Good Comeback!!!!,"Had Its Moments! Mostley made up for H20. After The CrapFest that H20 was, This was a good attempt. Hopefully Rob Zombie does a Great Job on his Version."
3,It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either,it was a descent film but it is not as good as the first and second Halloween movies. I really don't recommend it because it really was a lame movie. Halloween H20 was so much better then this one. But like i said it was halfway descent. Halloween 9 is coming out Aug 31 2007 hopfuly it's good and not crap. And hopfuly they kill Michael in Halloween 9 and end the series before they really screw it up.
2,michael has lost his scare,"halloween ressurection was not nearly as good as h20, and i can't belive that they killed off Jamie Lee Curtis within the film's first ten minutes. with bad acting, and a clustraphobic atmosphere, this movie, even with michael myers, is not scary. the language that they use is not nessecary, and even i can pull off better one liners then the main people. a true dissapointment to the halloween series. not reccomended."
3,HALLOWEEN:RESURRECTION,"THIS FILM IS COOLER THAN 'HALLOWEEN' PARTS 2,4,5,AND H2O PLUS THE OTHER HALLOWEEN FILMS I LIKE TO WATCH ARE PART 1,3[THOUGH IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 1 AND 2],AND 6[THE BEST ONE TO WATCH OR OWN ON VHS OR DVD]. THIS HALLOWEEN HAD SOME COOL KILLS,BETTER CAST[THOUGH JAMIE LEE CURTIS DIED SO SHE WASN'T IN THE FILM TO LONG],AND MICHAEL MYERS HAD MORE POWER TO KILL THOSE IN HIS HOUSE.THE PLOT WAS NOT BAD AND WAS NOT AS BLOODY AS THOSE OTHER SLASHER FILMS BUT STILL WATCHABLE.THE PART I LIKED WAS THE END WHEN THE TWO SURVIVORS BURNED MICHAEL MYERS.A DECENT IMPROVEMENT OVER THOSE HALLOWEEN FLICKS.THIS ONE IS THE SECOND BEST."
2,Not As Good As Halloween H20,Why was Halloween H20 the best sequel besides Halloween 2?Simple because Lori Strode was the main character. In the television spots for this movie Lori Strode appears to have some great scenes and looks like she will be good throughout the entire movie. She would be good if she were not only in the first 10 minutes. The first 10 minutes are great but after that it shifts to this live webcast of a bunch of unknowners who you can care less about and it is obvious that Sara will be taking over Laurie Strode's place. The entire webcast is very predictable. Do not be surprised if they are in the making for another Halloween movie ;)
2,overdone!!!!!,this is ridiculous!THEY CAN EXCEPT MICHAEL IS DEAD!!!!!!!!!!! i LOVED THE OTHER HALLOWEENS BUT THIS GIVES THEM A BAD NAME! THEY DIDNT EVEN CAST ANYONE GOOD EXCEPT FOR JAMIE LEE CURTIS I AM SUPISED THE DIRECTOR WAS THE DIRECTOR OF HALLOWEEN 2.
2,Two stars because it's Halloween.,"I just wanted to tell everyone how Michael Myers survived the head chop thing. ;)I knew from the minute we saw Myers in H20 that it wasn't Michael Myers. Just look at him. You can clearly see his eyes. They made such a big deal out of his eyes in the first Halloween (and also in the pre-movie narration from Loomis in H20), about how the eyes are black, void of anything. And we CLEARLY saw his eyes in H20.So it wasn't Michael Myers. And for the inevitable ""what about his being invincible"" argument, well, chasing people who think you're the antichrist is going to give you a huge adrenaline rush.That's all. So stop bitching about it because he got ""decapitated."" Start bitching about it because it's a Blair Witch Project rip off that came 3 years too late and another installment to a movie series that stopped being good over 20 years ago."
1,Another sequel.....,"Not much really needs to be said but, I'm sure you are all asking the same question as I am...When is Michael going to die! I love the original Halloween movies but come on kill him already and end this series before you screw it up anymore. The same goes for Friday the 13th I mean Jason X with Jason...in space?! Jason needs to die, Mike Myers needs to die and Freddy Krueger needs to die. We love the old movies but please stop reviving them somehow just let them die!"
5,A Very Good DVD,"I never got the chance to see H:R when it was in theatres so I was eagarly awaiting it on DVD.I was very happy with movie as well as everything on the DVD when I got it.It had many interesting extras such as interviews,deleted scenes,3 alternate endings and all the webcam footage from the movie and some not put together to make kind of a mini movie.I've already lost track of how many times I've watched it."
1,The worst of them all,"The worst 'Halloween' in the series is definitely 'Resurrection'.This 'Halloween' made 'Halloween III' enjoyable, made entirely off of Vanessa Williams, it was like watching the first 10 minutes of 'Scream' where they made a big deal of Drew Barrymore. I've had more fun clipping my toe nails than watching this piece of garbage. The only good 'Halloween''s in the series were 4 & 5. Before Jaime was killed off by some hay bailer in #6. If anyone could have made a worse 'Halloween' it would have been Spielberg. This movie was bulls**t to the horror industry, I hated it and so will most of the fans of horror."
4,A great Horror Movie...,I really liked the movie there was some good spots and some bad ones so you could rent it or buy it you'll love the movie if you are a big fan of the Halloween series this one is a winner...
5,"Kind of off the topic, but still good.","This movie was in all a scary movie. I mean it does have Michael killing WAY too many people like one of the 2-6 sequels, but its alright. Aside from the lame decapitation, all of the deaths are good. But I think Tyra Banks should have gotten a bigger part, I mean she's such a hottie and a slightly good actress. she deserved atleast an un-cut death scene. jamie lee curtis' death was kind of dumb, i mean she's already in a psychiatric was, so kill the S.O.B. but it was a good movie. and whats the deal with sarah? hopefully it'll turn out she's related to micael, and that way the movie will make more sense."
1,So Sad!!!,"This Movie really Stinks. I love all the Halloweens except for this one and H20. Whatever marketing person hired these actors was just trying to make money and does not care at all about what Halloween means to hardcore Halloween fans. By putting LL cool J, Busta Rhymes, Tyra Banks and the teen popular actors in it was a pathetic marketing strategy. HIP HOP HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH HALLOWEEN. But I guess you have to give money hungry movie makers credit for trying to appeal to a wider audience. What happened to Jamie Loyd and the curse of thorn?"
5,A GREAT ADDITION TO THE HALLOWEEN SAGA!!!,"After the ending in H20 I was disappointed that there wouldn't be any more.When I heard about this one I got very excited.Michael crushed a cop's throat and put him in the costume when he got his head chopped off.A group of 6 students are cast to be on a new television show called ''Dangertainment''.There's only one catch,the show takes place in the Myers house!The students must stay the night in the house and they will get a collage scholarship.Little do they know that Michael Myers is waiting for them.It was too bad that Laurie dies.There are no origional death scenes so for any fans who watch it for that reason alone should stick to the others in the series.For any horror fans or Halloween fans I would reccomened."
3,Michael Myers Vs JASON ????????,I am A Long time Fan oF the Halloween Films so I will notBash this film too much to be Truthfull The only Thing ILiked about this movie was the first 10min After that themovie lost my intreast.I would Love to See Michael myersvs jason But moustapha akkad would not let new line useHis likeness come on moustapha give the fans what theywant michael vs jason we are the ones that are keepingmyers alive so give us what we want .
1,garbage,"If you absolutly must see this movie- I implore any true Halloween fan to promptly get out of their chair after the film's prelude, and exit the movie theater..... One has to wonder if John Carpenter even watched this chode of a movie. I personally would have strangled Rosenthal to death for what he did to my character. This is like Jason X all over again. This sereis, and sevral others like it are as good as dead to any of it's original fans, appealing now only to pop cultured teenage masses. Were in God's name did they get the main female lead from? Her boyish grunts, goofy yells and complete lack of any personality really compliment Busta Ryhmes powerful acting talents...let me tell you. This movie is about as shallow as foot bath...a very classic, very epic horror sereis once again is ruined by pop culture, lame actors, and a director who dos'nt know his ... from a hole in the ground.and thats all I have to say about that."
4,I don't understand?,"Ok, this I do not understand. In Halloween: H20, Michael Myers head got cut off by Laura right, but there is going to be ANOTHER movie about Halloween. Don't get me wrong, those movies scared me to DEATH. I had nightmares for weeks but now im over it. But how are they going to make a movie with Michael Myres in it if his head is gone? Weird but Michael is in the movie b'cuz hes on the cover. Can sumone help me????"
3,Not What Some Are Expecting,"Not to spoil this film too much, but don't expect to see a whole lot of Jamie Lee Curtis's character (Laurie Strode) in this one. I've read a couple of drafts for the picture and other than the scenes involving Curtis this is pretty much sub-standard slasher flick poop. I even prefer the the two films with Daniell Harris to this hackneyed mess. You get a really promising beginning to the film. It completely and plausibly explains why Michael is still alive. Believe me. It does. From then on however, it is just another lame duck, post ""Scream"" slasher film. Fans of the series are going to go see it but they are not going to walk away satisfied. Sorry."
1,The worst Halloween sequal ever,This movie realy blows because 1.its a teen slasher film 2.Busta Ryhms is in it 3.Tyra Banks is in it 4.They mixed hip hop and horror together 5.it had dumb kills 6.Sean Patrick Thomas is in this and 7.Jamie Lee Curtis appears in this movies for about 15 minuts doing the whole 'Scream Drew Barrymore' thing.Aviod this crappy movie and go watch the original.
4,NOW HE'S BACK!,Halloween resurrection rocks regardless of the bad reviews you've heard. some people make fun of halloween saying he got his head chopped off but it wasnt him and some r like man thats so stupid but jason in space yeah thats sheer genius! before the summer Halloween resurrection was in the boston herald in the top 20 most anticapated movies of 2002 do u see any jason movies being anticapated hell no! so in this genre the chair goes to the king micheal myers
4,"Not disappointed at all, very impressed","I really enjoyed this movie. I felt it was entertaining & fast paced. I wish it were a little longer, though (10 mins or so). I made the mistake of reading too much about the movie & therefore ruining some of the scenes, because I knew what was coming. Of course the TV spot/trailer ruined another scene. Sure there were flaws & Busta was a little over the top, but overall the acting gets a passing grade. And I could look past the flaws, most movies have them, anyway. BTW this movie was 10x better than Jason X & definitely 1 of the better sequels."
3,This movie was not necessary. .. ..,". .. ok explain something to me.. was Micheal's heads choped off in H20 or what? Come on ! I would understad Freddy Kruger getting choped up to bits and comming back.. he was dead to begin with.I thought that H20 gave HALLOWEEN a good finish there was no reason for him to comeback. Now if it would of been told or explained that the Micheal in HALLOWEEN resurrection was a phony or something like that, it would of made more sense then not knowing what the hell happend or where did this guy come from.I see Micheal getting thrown of a building or getting shot, getting hit by a car even catching on fire. ..but not getting his head choped off and comming back to the resurrection film. I thought that was a stupied idea.The movie did have its moments. .. i would still wacth it.I just feel that this movie should have been more thought out.( People just want to make a quick buck )"
2,H20 should have been the final Halloween,Money and greed were the only rationale for making this film. Halloween H20 was a great way to close the series. Salutes and tributes to horror were all over the film with scenes referencing scenes from the original film (the sightings out the window in the middle of class) to icon cameos (Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis's mother/Psycho star) and the return of I&II;'s chain smoking nurse) to an opening tribute to Donald Pleasance via a voice over of classic lines from Halloween I.This movie had none of that and it sucked.
2,jamie dies in the 1st 10 mins,"jamie dies in the 1st 10mins so this movie sucks.the plot sucks and Busta Rhymes is in this. halloween needs to get off the rap guys they cant act! i hate this movie.halloween should have only made 3 films (halloween 1,halloween 2,halloween h20) and thats it"
3,There should not have been another one!,"Anyone who has actually watched the ending of halloween H20 would know that, that was indeed Michael who's head was cut off. This movie was just made to countinue the series of films and introduce it to a whole new generation. Halloween Ressurection does not even follow H20's storyline because Jamie Lee is only in the first ten minutes. I dont really like the movie, but it's an ok movie only when there is nothing else to watch."
4,Dangertainment!,"The movie is great. The kills are nasty too. The movie is about a team launching an internet webcam called Dangertainment in the Myers house. From then on people start getting killed for no reason. Wierd, that there are'nt any Myers relatives in the movie. I highly recommend this movie."
2,Worst of the Halloween movies,"I can't describe the utter disappoint I had when seeing Resurrection in the theater the first time. First off, I'm a huge fan of the series and I own all of them, even the bad ones. First off, they did a rush job in the first ten minutes of the movie to resolve the Lorie storyline, then the movie become pointess for the next 80+ minutes.Michael returns to his Haddonfield home to find his house being occupied by a group of Hollywood fresh-faced college students. They're all involved in a reality tv show called Dangertainment. This premise is lame and has nothing to do with the storyline of the series. Furthermore, Bustarymes almost single-handedly destroys the franchise by ""drop-kicking"" Michael Myers. I wanted to get up and leave the theater during this scene.I gave it 2 stars because there is some suspense and fun to be had, and Michael has a cool look in this movie with one of the better masks since Halloween II."
1,stupid,The only good part was the first 10 minutes when Jamie Lee Curtis was in it. This is a reality horror movie. Come on!!!! As if we don't have enough of reality shows. Everytime we see a B rated R&B singer (like Kelly Rowland in Freddy Vs. Jason) or a hip hop rapper in a horror movie like Busta Rhymes or LL Cool J in H20 you know it's going to be a really really bad horror movie.
2,THE ONLY BAD HALLOWEEN!,"This movie sucks. Stupid Story, Stupid actors and is the worst film of the series. If you are a Mainline movie goer this film is for you but if you are a diehard fan of true horror this film this film will only disipoint."
1,Not Worth The Money They Spent Making It!,"If this movie was supposed to have picked up where H20 ended, then what happened to Laurie Strode's son John and his girlfriend Molly? They lived at the end. If Laurie was in a psychiatric hospital, you'd think John and Molly would return to help his mother escape out of the hospital and battle Michael. But no, we have to watch Laurie die and suffer through 94 minutes of Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes trying to act! I can't believe Dimension spent $30 million making this movie. What a waste!"
4,Halloween:Resurrection,What can I say? Excellent flick. I was rather bummed though when Laurie died. I love the line: I will see you in hell Micheal. I thought it was done great...I encourage all to go see it. It is definitely worth owning once it is on video.
5,Is He Dead This Time????,"Ever since the very first Halloween movie, I have been hooked on this series. I have to admit, the only ones that I own are the ones with Jamie Lee Curtis in them, mainly because it's a continuation of the original. I honestly didn't expect much out of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be pretty good, and I don't think you will be disappointed in this movie, either."
3,Ok Halloween,The movie is ok. Not the best sequel. I thought this was better than Halloween 5. The transfer onto blu ray is a little bit better than the DVD release also.
1,Another blight on the franchise...,"The original Halloween was the greatest horror movie of all time. Since then, a series of inferior sequels were released one after the other. Some were watchable such as Halloween 4. And one was actually pretty good; Halloween H20. But most were terrible drivel. Halloween 2 was a let down, Halloween 3 was an abomination, Halloween 5 was a crime against nature, and Halloween 6 (The Curse of Michael Meyers) was perhaps the worst movie ever made. Then Halloween H20 came out and surprised everybody. It was good! Could this be a trend to revive the dying franchise? Unfortunatly, the answer is no because ""H2o"" was followed with ""Resurrection"" which effectively sank the franchise back into the depths of its own miserable oblivian."
2,Evil Finds Its Way Home Again - And Now Evil Is Grounded,"Upon watching some of the bonus material on the DVD, I realized why the movie had a closed-in, artificial feel to it. It's because the movie itself was filmed in a closed-in, artificial setting. The house, the small portion of the street that is actually visible on film and the ""outdoors"" were all created on a studio filming lot. This, I feel, granted the movie a terribly fake aura.The idea for the movie is an attempt to stretch the dark origins of Michael Myers into the modern, technological day. It's a bit too much of a stretch, to be honest. It comes off as cheesy. The acting is not that bad, but the plot and the way it is played out are just short of pathetic. The movie is not scary, suspenseful or even that interesting.If you've got 90 minutes to kill, maybe it's worth a viewing, but you will be disappointed on a number of levels."
2,The worst Halloween ever!,"Enough is enough already ,geez...how many times is Michael gonna come back ?I have to admit that the idea was good but overall the movie really blew due to the casting of Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks.I mean are all the friggin rap stars and models gonna be in movies now,pathetic if you ask me.If this is the future of horror movies,then count me out.I miss the good ole 80's slashers,those people could actually act and the murders were more creative"
2,Good box office bad movie,There have been so many websites that have given this a terrible review am i going to be any different in one word no!The beginning of the movie is classic halloween and then is on a downward spiral and never looks back.This series desperately lacks the presence of Donald Pleasence god bless his soul or anyone nearthat caliber filling his shoes but busta rhymes you might better have marilyn manson in this schlok of a next installment.At times a complete ripoff of blair witch .There are a few chep scares but if the series continues it's current path i wish john carpenter still had the rights so he coud have killed michael off at the end of the classic HALLOWEEN!
3,"""What took you so long?""","This line, uttered by the fated Jaime Lee Curtis in her menial guest role for this film, is the phrase that says it all. With the remarkable (and finite) ending of H20, we all thought, and I hoped, it was all over for Michael Myers (don't get me wrong, i love these films, but why let it go too far?). However, the capitalist in us all reminded us that any film that shows any hint at success will inevitably spawn a sequel. This is it. With a plot that is way too reminiscent of ""Blair Witch 2"" (which in turn was a huge rip-off of ""Blair Witch Project""), it is only redeemed by the acting of Busta Rhymes and Bianca Kajlich. Michael himself is reminscient of H20 and 6, but with a good mask. I will admit that the final chase scene between Myers and characters Sarah and Freddie was good. Overall, not the best film, but not the worst by far."
4,Great customer service,"The unit came in and a pin that MUST be pressed into place was missing from the target assembly.I contacted the manufacturer's customer service and they promptly shipped out an entirely new target assembly. They told me to keep the defective unit for spares!Gotta love it.I'll update the review after I used it.UPDATE:The replacement unit had the exact same problem!I contacted them, they said ""Oops!"" and told me they will send a 3rd unit. I encouraged them to check the 3rd one to make sure all is OK prior to sending it.They cheerfully agreed so we will see what shows up.Finally got the issue resolved. They ship the units WITHOUT the final pin in place. So, make sure you have a firm ""anvil"" or another surface on which you can support the bar to hammer the pin into place.All works great now."
2,Do-All Outdoors .9mm-30.06 Auto Reset Target,"This target is made of metal strong enough to handle 9mm ammo. It is clearly durable. However, to be used at a minimum of 30 feet, the target is so small that it is difficult to hit dead-on to make it function as advertised. I found myself aiming slightly above the soil level in order to contact the target. Because it is so small, this target makes for a very difficult and unrealistic shoot. Also the DVD that came with the box is more of an advertisement for Do-All, and not the assembly directions, and does not run completely through. I feel this target was a waste of my money."
2,Missing parts,"Item was shipped and delivered quickly. There was parts missing, the box was open, and there was no instructions. I called Do-All, and they said they would replace the missing parts. The store that sold the item should check returned items to ensure that all parts are there before the sell it again. I would not purchase anything from that company(J&M Hunting supplies and Marine) again."
3,not a must have!,It's an unauthorised biography of christina. Basically it's a woman telling how Christina became famous and things like that. There are also a couple of short interviews. It might be interesting if you wanna know everything about her career. For me personally her music is the important thing and I don't care so much about her past and what she does and what people think about her. So it's definitely not a must have!!
5,Great for workout,"I brought this to workout in a gym. It wasn't the slickest style but sturdy and not bulky. It takes only one AAA battery which can last for a long time. For what I have paid for, the sound quality was better than expected."
2,Not for the clumsy,"I bought this after reading the above Amazon reviews. It is indeed a fine unit; all the above is true. However, the FIRST time it fell from my neck onto a solid floor a speaker busted off and now hangs by wires.Upon examination, I see that each headphone is secured only by a thin, flexible plastic joint. I'm going to try to stuff wires back in and superglue it back together, but I'd have prefered a much sturdier design!"
3,poor reception,"Item arrived quickly, packaged well, in good condition, as described, and with a battery. However, reception was poor and had static. If you turned your head, you lost the station. Would not order this item again."
3,The Headphones that have a Music Player in them,"Its sound effects are great. The idea for this is just brilliant. I love listening to music anywhere I go, but you will have a hard time getting it to stay on. Other than that its fantastic!"
1,what a joke,"I bought this head set a couple of years back for $20 and have had nothing but troubles with it, it sure isn't worth $199, save your money!"
3,"A hard read, but lots of good info","This book is basically a lit review of everything fluvial geomorphology. It is a great resource, but a bit difficult to read. One frustrating thing is that because it is so extensive in what it covers, it never give you a definitave answer. Instead it will give you every argument from every side. That's good if that's what you're after."
5,New Takes on Old Tunes,"The Assads have once again produced a unique presentation of songs some of us know by heart. This is a must-have addition to anyone's music collection, and would be an excellent starting point to begin an Assad collection."
4,"Great calculator, great deal",I bought this USED calculator and it works perfectly fine. It was shipped on time and with the bonus of being neatly packed and with both quick guide and User's Manual.
2,Not What Was Expected,I expected the book to be a children's book but the content is so varied and the material all over the map. I would not give this book to a small child and I would have to pick content to share. I was disappointed with the book.
5,Lots of Love,"It's very gentre and heart-warming musics. Although If you can't understand Japanese, you can feel it from Akko's voices and melodies. If you can understand it, you can feel from lyrics, also.This CD compiled from her two albums, ""Welcome Back"" and Love Life"" (Released in Japan). I love these Albums best in Akko's all works. Pat Metheny, Charie Haden, Peter Erskine, Anthony Jackson, David Palmer, Will Lee, Steve Ferrone, Ryuichi Sakamoto (her husband) have joined this recordings and have done good jobs! I especially like Pat's playing on ""Lots of Love""."
5,Giraffe,Our granddaughter will love this giraffe to add to her collection of stuffed animals. Wish I could have afforded the really large giraffe.
5,how can you resist a giraffe?,"I love that it is TALL and plush......Not unreasonably-tall, or hard-to-find-a-place-for-tall ---- but also not tuck-under-your-arm-tall. This is a stuffed giraffe that is well balanced so it stands easily. A good choice for ~$20."
4,MEMORY GIRAFFE,"The Star questions don't really tell about this toy animal stuffed giraffe. It is approximate two feet tall and is firm and stands on it's own. I am happy with this product & the price. It was shipped out quickly. I purchased ""EBENEZER"" for an anniversary present. It has meanings which I won't explain but the toy giraffe excellently presented them and was instantly loved by my wife. He isn't something that you can play with and still look as nice as it does. Well made, no blemishes found. Of course it is soft and cute!"
5,Plush Giraffe,"What an adorable addition to the nursery! Stands well, and seems very durable...my 2 year old loves him already. Exactly what we wanted, arrived on time and packed well."
5,Wonderful Gift for my Collector Son,After an extensive search for books on Fenton ware I found this very informative and comprehensive book which details all the glassware produced in that era at the Fenton works. The book had magnificent photos of each piece and gave the values as well as an interesting history of each piece. It is a wonderful book for the serious collector and my son is thrilled with it. I believe from my examination of the book that I could not have chosen better.
5,The pictures do the talking,"This is a beautiful book which covers some of Kiefer's best work in painting as well as his photo-montage and book making activities. A small and eloquent tribute and forward leave adequate room for many full color reproductions (some double-paged) of paintings, large black and white photos taken by the artist, photos of installations and performances and reproductions of selections from his book makings. The reproductions are bright and clear and attempt to give you an adequate view of the texture and matter that Kiefer paints with. Kiefer is one of the most prodigious and poetic artists of our time. He stands out individually in our present, sometimes cynical art atmosphere in the age of post-modern theory. These are magical paintings that contain deep myth and meaning. A truly beautiful book on beautiful and revealing art that can change your view of the world."
3,Some problems with this edition,"This edition by Cambridge lacks the corrigenda that the author added as a preface when the book was republished in New York in 1982. The Press also seems to be afraid of identifying the author as a religious, surprising the S.J. which appeared in the two previous editions of this work.Although a work of solid scholarship and thorough sympathy for the Latin theologians, Fr. Gill's inability to understand the Greek Orthodox position can be maddening at moments."
5,FORGOTTEN CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE,"One of Russ Meyer's sublime masterpieces, a tale of revenge and murder in a small desert community.Alex Rocco is perfect in the lead, and Haji is an excellent sidekick.Fits with Mudhoney and Faster Pussycat as Meyer's trilogy on the evils of violence."
4,organizer,This is a sturdy corner shelf unit to make access to my dinnerware easier...and without chipping the plates! I did look at less expensive ones in Bed Bath and Beyond....however I felt this product was more robust and not having a fixed bottom piece was ideal for those larger plates. My only critiscm is that I put cups on the top shelf and they do seem a bit wobbly due to the larger spaces between the wire struts.....however I am very pleased with this.
1,Baltimore Raven's Wastebasket,A little bit too big for a bedroom wastebook. Quality is very poor. Item came dented and we were going to try to push dents out but they were all over. As far as returning the item we had no problem at all.
5,A historical review of the tragic 1942 battle at Kharkov,"First, this book is not a nice historical novel.This book is the dry recollection of the decisions, orders, order of battle and development of the Russian offensive in the Southwestern Front by General Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko and the following counterstrike by the German forces led by Marshall Fedor von Bock and General Kleist near the city of Kharkov in May 1942. This battle was a great defeat for Russian forces that lost close to 300,000 soldiers and officers.An invaluable historical document. A delight for all military history buffs."
