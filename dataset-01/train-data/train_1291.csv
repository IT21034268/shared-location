3,"Good design, but poorly made","As far as design, I like this bag. Pockets are well placed, and while you can't fit much beyond a laptop (15"" Macbook Pro in my case), you can't get a slim/low-profile bag that you can live out of. I do wish the little pocket on the strap had a clear opening so I could put my train pass in it.The one thing I am very disappointed by is how the bag is made. There are small loose threads all over the place, and this shouldn't happen with a $50 bag."
4,not so roomy... but awesome!,"i absolutely love this bag! not only does it look sleek and serve its purpose very well, but it fits like a glove. i hate heavy shoulder bags.my one complaint about this item is that there's not a ton of room. you can fit your laptop and accessories, notebook, a magazine and a few other little things and that's about it. if you're wanting a bag to carry giant school books, this isn't it! this problem may be because it's brand new and has yet to be stretched, but i don't think it will stretch too much."
4,Belkin Laptop Sling Bag,"Great bag - very comfortable when filled. There is limited space to carry much more than the laptop, but ultimately this is a good thing because it forces you to be selective about what to carry and not overload your back."
1,Quality Issues,I was disappointed with the quality of this item. The colors are faded and the materials are second class.
5,A must have for Mac owners,"This is a great slingback pack!!! It says it's for a 15"" but it comfortably fits my 13"" Macbook Pro. Don't buy this if you are looking for a rugged fit everything backpack. This is lightweight just as it states. But with that being said it fits the essentials with no problem. The charger bag that it comes with is great. I'm surprised that all backpacks don't come with this type of bag. One more thing the laptop section is velour lined so it protects the outer shell of the laptop perfectly."
5,Great lightweight bag,"I've been using this bag for several weeks now, and it really has satisfied me. The bag is a bit small, yes, but it more than makes up for that in its light weight, and other amenities. It's astonishingly light, and yet I still manage to fit a laptop, a notebook, papers, and a the occasional massive math textbook. The strap is great too, and very easy to take on and of with the buckle. It's also very, very comfortable. There's not much more to say about it. It's stylish, light, big enough, durable, and comfortable; what more could I ask for?"
3,Its nice but i wanted something thats sleeker,The prodouct was really good in terms of quality and stability. I did not use it and had to return it because I am a women and it seemed to look big on me . It wasn't as sleek as I had imagined it to be. I think it would look great on guys.
4,Pretty Nice so far,Pretty sleek bag. The only thing is I wish it could stand vertically on the floor but other than that its a nice bag.
1,Poor quality,"I used this bag occasionally for exactly six months and watched it steadily deteriorate until the point where it is now useless. Great looks, tolerable capacity; but terrible zippers, shoddy stitching and a laughable headphone output plastic circle (it came off in about a week) far outweigh the benefits, easily making it the WORST bag I've ever owned. Invest a few extra dollars and purchase any North Face bag and you will not be dissapointed!"
4,Wanted a slim backpack with a sling and got it,"This is pretty much what I was looking for in a backpack. Slim and simple with a sling. The fabric is not as smooth as my last sling backpack, but it wouldn't stop me from buying it again."
4,Good quality bag,"This bag was a tad bigger than I thought it would be. However, it's a very good quality bag. It has enough room to hold a slim Macbook Pro, with a notebook, folders, and a textbook. The sling strap is very comfortable as well. I recommend it to others."
5,exactly what I expected and then a bit more,"Product received promptlyIt has plenty of space to store my laptop. Protection is top notch and the laptop is stopped from moving around too much. Really like all the small pockets located all around the pack as well as the chord bag to carry the power supply of my laptop.The general carrying space is plenty for carry most of my electronic supplies but is slim on space if used for school books and folders.Sturdiness is good. It is able to carry maximum space and not show signs of much stress. Carrying it is comfortable and the pack really stays in place even through lots of rigorous movement, in my case rollerblading."
5,Very Good Product,"Fast delivery; good price for good product. I bought this bag for my cousin and he absolutely loves it, it meets all his needs, and fits him perfectly."
4,Love them!,"Boots fit perfectly! A little bigger in the calves than I expected, but still look amazing."
2,Not enough cliches,"This book is fine as a joke gift - it has plenty of interesting and sometimes amusing attempts to describe the origins of many cliches. But because it devotes so much time to describing the origins, it misses most of the cliches out there. It doesn't deserve the title of 'dictionary'."
3,Fairly inclusive of most phrases,"I guess I expected more 'informative' information about the origin of such phrases rather than just how each phrase was typically used. I assumed we all would know what 'to heave a sign of relief' meant, but I was curious how it came about. His explanations are mainly research of the first time the phrase might have been recorded or used. All in all I was a bit disappointed but it's my fault. I should have purchased a book intending to give the origin of use not just a dictionary. But I do think it covers most cliches."
2,Anemic Collection of Cliches,"Really this book needs some vitamins. It's suitable for high school students, if that, and not much more despite it's clever cover."
3,Fun but pretty useless,This was fun at first but it got old pretty quick. It is definately interesting for quick pick ups but not to read.
4,This book is a keeper,It identifies or attempts to identify the origin of hundreds of cliches we use in everyday life. It is a fun book to read.
1,too little,this book of cliches was too light in content. the ones that were in there pretty obvious. this is the type of rag i would expect to find at the walgreens bookshelf.
3,Lots of good songs from Elizabeth Mitchell,"I wasn't very familiar with Lisa Loeb before purchasing this cd. I do love Elizabeth Mitchell, and that was my reason for buying this. I absolutely love all of the songs Elizabeth sings in this cd. I also like the ones where Lisa and Elizabeth harmonize. However, I don't care for Lisa's voice; I find it nasaley (sp?) and grating. I always skip through the Lisa Loeb songs to get to the next E.M. song.I think the book/cd case is a good idea, yet the book is very strange and makes no sense."
5,Really like it,"My son has enjoyed this book and cd combo since he was two (he's now 3.5). Although not his favorite, he really took to the story. The music cd is a lot of fun. We like all of the songs. It's a nice blend of mello w/ one faster and fun. It's usually my pick for keeping things at a nice quiet pace in the home. Enjoy!"
5,Simple the best.....,"I bought this cd after my 3 year old and I heard and saw the video Stop & Go on Noggin. My daughter fell in love with the song. I wanted to give her a chance to own her own collection of music. Before I bought the cd, I listened to every song sample Amazon allows you to listen to. After listening, I fell in love with the songs too. When it arrived I had no idea the cd comes with a book. Very Cool! Lovely story to read before bed. We play Catch the Moon everyday. We dance and sing to all the songs. We even have my 8 year old son involved. Lisa Loeb & Elizabeth Mitchell did a wonderful job on this cd. I and my family recommend it!"
4,Enjoyed It,I'm not going to write a plot summary since so many others on Amazon have already did it. I really enjoyed this book. I didn't know anything about show horses or competition jumping/riding. I like the idea of getting a wealthy family together and throwing in some mystery. I enjoyed how the main characters interacted and felt like you got a good picture of them. I've never read anything by Andrea Kane but I believe I will pick up some more of her romantic mysteries. I didn't like how the ending wrapped up in like 20 pages. I felt it left some things unexplained and wanted to find a happy ending for all the characters but other than that I would recommend this book to the romantic mystery readers out there.
3,"3.5, Just So-So","I have read several of Kane's books. This book, just didn't impress me very much. The story really drags along. I did not know there was some sort of order to Kane's books. She uses the same characters in all the ones I have read so far. Glad I got this from the library rather than paying for it."
2,slow reading,"I read a lot of mysteries and this one was hard to finish. It dragged on for two thirds of the book. I hope that is not how this author's other books read. If she says, "" she blew out her breath"" in any other books, I'm not interested. The story line wasn't very believable."
2,Jumstart Advance Preschool,"I was excited about getting this for my boys but the excitement was short lived as I loaded it on the computer and had my boys try it out. The program it not challenging at all. It seems to be based more on music and animation than concrete skills. After you receive a pet reward you go to a playroom to play with your pet. There is music from the older Fisher Price Ready for School Toddler program. The program froze the computer after only using it once before on the computer. Thankfully Knowledge Adventure sent me a patch to help the glitches.I am so disapointed with this version of Jumpstart. I am trying to salvage my 1999 version Jumspstart Preschool, and my boys are asking to use the older version.I'll try the Arthur version of a school program and see if it is any better. I like the indepth description of it but I run Windows XP and may have to adjust it for such or contact someone to get a patch so it runs with the system."
5,Great way to spend an evening!,"Randomly enough, I was actually down in LA recently and had this film recommended to me by a lovely lady at a bar. I must say, I'm not the most into Indy films, but this one has made a believer out of me! From start to finish the film was a fun one to follow - a lot of quality, well placed laughs and an entertaining story as well. What really did it for me is that the characters were a lot more ""real""... it made the film a lot more engaging than it would have been if I were watching the standard cardboard cut-out characters that you get in pretty much every mega-studio production now. I do know it's only a few weeks into the year, but getting this film will probably be one of the best things I did in 2011!"
2,Bill is a dull dude.,"This movie is clearly missing a beat. It tries to move slow and real and then degenerates into high school level humor too often. (Funny how all the high school kids in the movie celebrate the weak points...) It's not a particularly good movie. It tries hard to have that Euro simple minimalist feel to it but American directors that try to do this are basically always missing a beat. It's a high school play at best. The fireworks gimmick is pretty inane. Yes, it moves along like an extended Saturday Night Live skit. The attempts at profound observations are well, silly and predictable. Okay, let's call it like it is: Another American waste of a movie. It says much about the movie that the best performance is by Jessica Alba. Don't pay to watch this movie.Jim HarrisAuthorA Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez""We are all illegal immigrants once in awhile.""Bob Slick, Texas Border Guard"
1,Crass instead of Class,IMDB says: 140 Uses of F***. Really? We didn't even watch the film. Hollywood keeps putting out trashy films and these get exported worldwide. It is no wonder so many people are disgusted with our country.
4,surprisingly entertaining,Quite an entertaining film. Went in with little expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Film should be enjoyable for fans of most agegroups; funny premise and executed well.
4,Entertaining,"This was a very entertaining movie and got a lot of laughs! It has some somewhat inappropriate material in it for younger viewers, so do be careful if you want to watch this in a family setting. It's a slightly awkward story line, but overall it was an enjoyable movie!"
1,New Meet Bill movie,"The scratched DVD received. I watched the movie and when I tried to re-sell it or exchange it at those shops at the mall, they told me it was not worth anything due to the scratches, not good."
2,eh.... no,"bought the movie for the cast. pretty decent line up. aaron eckert was awesome in ""thank you for smoking"". jessica alba and elizabeth banks are gorgeous. but, this plot was dull and the events remind me of a slap stick ""american beauty"". some parts were just plain weird."
2,borderline watchable,"The screenplay is not God awful, just really bad, and not even a great cast can do much with it. A couple of laughs, though, and that's basically it. TV rerun quality but definitely not worth paying for to watch, sorry."
2,Anolon 16-Quart Stainless Steel Covered Stockpot,I used my new pot to make fig pickle and it did a super job! It is deep enough so I didn't have to be concerned with boil-over and as the figs and vinegar have to remain in the pot for a number of hours after cooking I decided a stainless steel pot would fill the bill. I would recommend this stainless steel stockpot without reservation!
4,"Good, solid pot","I scanned the internet to make sure I was getting a good price at $32, and am very pleased with the quality of this pot. Sturdy,heavy; does not appear thin to me (I'm not an expert chef, hence the 4 stars, to acknowledge ""professional ware"" may be ""better""). I wanted a large pot after exhausting every available little pot I had during our last family gathering, boiling potatoes, etc. I used this pot immediately to cook a large batch of corn on the cob for a backyard barbque - perfect size! Nice stainless steel; easy to clean. Great deal!If you ever cook for more than 4 or 5 people, you will get your use out of this size pot!"
4,outer limits,"a uniquely mind-opening work that deftly explores the ""cutting edge"" of severe anatomical explorations.A forbidden work that surely upsets conservatives everywhere."
4,"Blurring the lines between body, mind, and machine","This book contains interviews, essays, and art from some of the most cutting edge body artists, authors, and fringe culture critics from around the world. Stelarc, Franko B, Ron Athey, and Orlan all give their take on why they do what they do. Sex, cyborgs, freaks, and the eroticism of destruction are all examined. This is a book for those who think without boundaries. Only a few selections which drag or seem out of place keep this from being a 5 star work. For more content like this, also refer to 'Suture : The Arts Journal', edited by Jack Sargeant (also a contributor to this work)."
5,Disburbing but necessary book,"I am alarmed at the new and growing theological movement known as Hyperpreterism, which Keith Mathison's expose examines. I am mostly alarmed that here is another example of superficial Christians going off the deep-end.Dr. Mathison and his assembly of Reformed scholars provide a fine critique of this strange new movement (cult?). Several other reviews have shown the strange doctrines being promoted in this movement; I will not repeat those.I will just say: If you are a concerned, evangelical Christian, you NEED to get this book. Just read the negative reviews posted on Amazon.com and try to imagine a movement with such people promoting it getting into your church!If you love historic Christianity, you won't like this new movement. If you want to keep up on such deviant theologies, you will need this book. It is very well written by a number of reputable Reformed scholars."
1,WHOLLY COW,"THIS BOOK IS SO FULL of holes you can fly a blimp through it. Strimple writes that scripture consistantly speaks of the ""resurrection of the body"" but where are his references? One wondersif he has heard f the resurrection of the dead?When will the positive reviewers go to school and drop the ad populum fallacy.Sve your money or buy russell's ""The Parousia"".AMEN"
1,Beware the Creedalism,"Here is a book by people stuck in the sixteenth century and unwilling to reform. It is eisegetical, unsound, and denies the perspicuity of scripture. The contributors brazenly ignore the fact that you can't prove anything from history.Gentry and Mathison show themselves to be creedolaters without shame. Along with the positive reviews, Gentry and Mathison dismantle the Bible WORD by WORD.So Mathison and Gentry went to Whitefield in Florida, what accreditation does that seminary have?Save your money and wait for a book that exegetes scripture."
3,shows the weakness of hyper-creedalism,"this book shows the weakness of hyper-creedalism and biblical exegesis. i imagine that there are better books out there that critique hyper-preterism from the dispensational camp. it is easily refuted by a ""House Divided, Bridging the Gap""; david Green editor.that being said, this book accurately sums up the criticisms of hyperpreterism from amillenial and postmillenial theologians. i recommend both books."
1,Very unhappy,I have the same problem as the first review. The electric is one positive and one negative with one red wire going to the light it self. I am a musician and a electrician buy trade so as long as you know black is positive and white is negative you pretty much can't go wrong.I do not recommend this product at ALL.
2,"Beware, Compact Fluorescents Bulbs don't work!","After spending the time to install this light and quickly burning out the compact fluorescent light bulbs, I called their toll free number. They informed me that the CFL's don't work in Dual Brite lights even with the Dual Brite switch turned to OFF. Something about the circuitry of each device interfering with the other's. I asked why they didn't state that relevant item anywhere in the instructions. ""Because we wouldn't sell any"" is what he should have replied.Thus I would have to rate this light as OBSOLETE! Who uses incandescent? And thus this light is NOT energy efficient, as it tries to lead you to believe on the box."
5,Professors must be neutral in instruction .,So much has changed on the college campus of today. Parents have to be extra vigilant about helping their children to pick the right college. This informative book by Mr. Yardley will help you to understand the radical thinking and changes of the Administration and Staff of many educational institutions today. Young minds can be swayed in the political and religious personal direction of the Professors. This author points out why the emphasis should be on formal education and not the current mind-bending.
2,Batman and Robin,"I knew this movie was in trouble from the opening credits when Arnold got billing over Clooney and O'Donnell. Not all bad though, and alot better than much of the stuff that passes for action films these days, but it could have been alot better if the ""suits"" at Warner Bros. had kept their hands off the script. Clooney is actually a very good Batman and the rest of the cast delivers, but the script and storyline are a mishmash obviously lumped together to create a rather large commercial for action figures and movie merchandise. This really could have been a much, much, better film."
1,Batman Lite,"This piece of excrement that calls itself a Batman film should have never seen the light of day. After ""Forever"" WB should have canned Joel Shumacher and got Tim Burton back. You could basicly see this coming by how campy ""Forever"" was. All of the characters were so poorly portrayed, it was like the Brady Bunch were wearing Batman, Robin, and Batgirl's costumes meaning these were not the same characters in the comics. They were different people. I don't blame the actors but the director and the writers. In my opinion, they should have hired Paul Dini and Bruce Timm, the geniouses behind the animated Batman. If you want a good Batman story that involves Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and Mr. Freeze, I recommend ""SubZero"". I also recommend ""Mask of the Phantasm"" which is the best of all the Batman films. If you haven't seen this movie, you are lucky and I envy you."
1,POOF!,"This movie should have been called, THE AMBIGUOUSLY GAY DUO: THE MOVIE.Or maybe [...] EYE FOR THE BAT GUY.Men die from kissing Uma Thurman, the bat suit has nipples, the acting is beyond campy, the camera is flamboyant, the colors are simply fabulous!!!Yikes, this was bad. Joel Schumacher became known as the director who killed the Batman franchise...and it never slowed down his career, no matter how many movies he wrecks.Thankfully, BATMAN BEGINS hit screens this year and proved that the Dark Knight can survive just about everything.Even assaults on his manhood."
1,Turkey of the Year goes to..........................,"Embarrassing for all involved.Bad editing,badly directed...the worst in the series.Joel Schumacher brought the franchise to a halt and buried it..Shame on you,Joel!! Not good enough to watch it as a guilty pleasure..All is missing is the POW's and the BOFF's from the original series....VERY BAD!!!!"
1,Unacceptable,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen.What I don't understand is how so many good actors can make one horrific movie. The plot is absurd, the characters ridiculous and cartoonish, and the backdrops obscene. See Robin race a motorcycle. See Alicia Silverstone lisping in a private schoolgirl uniform. See George Clooney smirking for two hours. HUH?!?If this is the future of Batman, the future is very bleak indeed. Do yourself and your sensibility a favor and stick with the first two in the series. Take comfort in Michael Keaton's masterful performances, Kim Basinger's unparalleled ability to scream, and Michelle Pfeiffer's absolutely breathtaking and superb performance as Catwoman."
2,So Bad It's Good,"Over the years, after what seems like weekly airings on TBS, this movie has earned quite a reputation for ruining the Batman series. Yes, the acting is awful, the script is horrendous, the jokes/puns are so bad you'd think a first grader wrote them. But over time and with multiple viewings, I have put this movie into the ""so bad it's good"" category (Lara Croft Tomb Raider is another that comes to mind). Even though it's the worst in the series, I just can't help watching this movie whenever it's on (hence the extra star). It's almost like watching a car crash, or a two headed dog. You know it's awful and you SHOULDN'T watch, but there's something compelling you. Over the years, I have come to be able to laugh at the jokes in this movie (not because they're funny, because they're so bad) I'm obviously not the only person to feel this way. Yes, this movie is pure trash, but it's fun, campy trash."
1,"Whoa, dude! I want a car!","Everything about this movie sucks. Everything. Never in the history of humanity has so much money been spent on something so pathetic (outside of the federal government). They should have had Neil O'Donnell playing Robin. It would have been more entertaining. Did I mention that this movie was unspeakably horrific, crude and vile? If you do nothing in your entire life, you can still avoid watching this crap and have a successful existence."
2,"WOW! BIG STARS, BIG BUDGET, BIG PIECE OF S***!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","My god this movie sucked. I cant believe the bad acting, the stupid pointless plot, the annoying as hell one-liners and everything else. George Clooney really sucks as batman, and he just doesent get the hang of being Batman at all. Val Kilmer was the best and Micheal Keaton wasent bad. Batman and Robin was just terrible. Dont see it at all. Your not missing anything special!"
1,One big mess!,"This was great film only if you're the kind of person who didn't grow up reading the comics and think that flashy special effects, big, marketable names & lots of movie-related toys are more important than plot or character development. Number 1 - Batman is psychotic! No one portrayed this better than Keaton. Number 2 - Quit messing with character development (anyone who loves the comics will agree with me, especially on the topic of ""Bane""). And lastly, why all the damn jokes? This isn't the sixties, we don't want to se re-hashed episodes of the old TV series. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this movie!"
1,Holly Lame Movie Batman!,"This movie is the worst. Caught up in the success of Forever, writters threw in a bad script and decided to give it more of a Power Rangers feel than Batman. Clooney was bad as Batman, O'Donnell was annoying, and what is up with those villians. This movie was, I was shocked, too colorful. Lame."
2,Not very worthwhile spending time on.....,"---(SIGH!)What can I say? Alicia Silverstone really got on my nerves....her lines were soooo cheezy and her acting was sooooo once again fake! George Clooney and Chris was fair....not much to say about them. Uma Thurman thinks she's everything, and her voice started to get to me.... Arnold, I thought he was smart enough to pick a role like this, but I admit his character was very sweet and funny. About the set and designs, it was obviously FAKE! With the money that HOLLYWOOD has, couldn't they at least make sets seem REAL? The plot was really dumb and dead. I like Alicia, it's just her role in this movie blew it!!! Sorry for being tough, but it's really how I felt about this movie, god! I want my money back! I can stand to watch TITANIC three times a week, but watching this every several months is ENOUGH!"
1,The worst movie ever made,"As a fan of the superhero genre, I was offended at the extreme nothing that this movie was. I cannot sit through five minutes of this steaming pile. I feel angry and upset just thinking about it. I hope they make a fifth one, and I hope it's good."
1,SSSSUUUUUCCCCKKKKSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh my god! This movie should never be allowed to be viewed by any human being ever! It would be cruel. I would choose the electric chair over whatching this movie. Joel Shumacher is too ""happy"" to direct a batman movie! I felt ashamed after i walked out of the movie theatre because i sat through the whole thing. :("
1,"Holy Bat-Disappointment, Batman!","The one-line summary says it all. No plot, stupid one-liners, bad acting, horrible script, awful neon junk, etc. Please, if there's any mercy at all, kick Joel Schumacher out of the Batman franchise and bring back Tim Burton! Or if Burton ain't interested in returning, at least consult him. I'm surpised there isn't a ""zero stars"" option, because that's what I would give this movie."
1,Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na BATMAN!,"Is this movie based on the old Batman TV show with Adam West? Actually, I've seen episodes of the TV show that outshined this piece of garbage. Outlandish sets and special effects cannot begin to compensate for all the lame one-liners and pathetic story line this movie has to offer. There are only so many puns one can make using the words ""ice"" and ""cool"" and Arnold manages to use every one. Joel Schumaker, I want my money back."
2,*sigh* what a crying shame.,"This film was lousy. I think there were some good parts, but Kilmer's arguing in Forever turned out to be a good thing (proven in this film). Somewhere on the set (1995).... Director: Alright Val, when Twoface punches you, do a triple backflip. Kilmer: That's ridiculouse! Can't we do something more realistic? After several hours of arguing, they agree on a jolt of the head. Two years later... Director: Alright Clooney, when Freez punches you, do a triple backflip. Clooney: Duh, okay. Director: Bwahaha!And that's how it came to stink. No Kilmer = no good. The cast was good, exept for Clooney. Robin's suit wasn't traditional, and it resembled that of Nightwing's. The characters spent half the time cracking jokes instad of kicking some butt. This is Batman here, not the joker."
2,insultingly bad,"Honestly, I think I'd rather stare at that flash animation of Adam West going ""ughabuggha"" for two hours than sit through this again."
1,TOTAL CRAP FEST,"first off i would like to say that i would have given this 0 stars but that wasn't an option. after seeing the first 2 i thought that this would be just as good because of the series reputation but i was wrong. i first saw this on HBO and it was really really stupid. there was a horrible plot and bad acting, getting Uma Thurmin to play poison ivy was a bad idea. i swear they were 1 step from going ''pow'' and ''bam'' after they hit each other. the plot was totally stupid, freeze trying to freeze the city, not to mention him saying ''I'm going to kick your ice''. the worst part of it is getting george clooney to play batman, thay mine as well have gotten adam sandler to play the dark knight. the movie is littered with bad puns and bad actors. in conclusion watch the first 2 they will bring you happiness, the bat man the way he was meant to be.peace out!"
1,Soon to be seen on Mystery Science Theater 3000,"I don't know what is left to say about this film. (...) This movie stinks. It is smelly. It needs a shower. I don't know what anyone involved with this movie was thinking. I also don't know how many zero's Warner Bros. put on the paychecks of all the people involved to get them to degrade themselves like this. It really is a god-awful movie. It is way too long and the effects are so hokey (Look! Ice that bends! Neato!). All the action sequences are fake. The actors are at their all-time low. I love Arnold to death, but come on, I would have taken a Kindergarten Cop sequel over this anyday. The scenery is overkill, I think Batman Forever was better because it wasn't so harsh on the eyes, but giant hollow naked statues? Someone's got to draw the line here folks."
1,"If I Could Give It Zero Stars, I Would","Batman is such an awesome character. He's dark, mysterious, serious, intelligent, exciting. . .well, at least he's supposed to be. He's not any of those things in this movie.Well, what is he then? Shallow? Dense? Comic relief where none is needed?This Batman movie is absolute [bunk]. It's like a bad rip-off of Batman. If anyone knows anything about Bane, you know that he is actually thinking, mastermind. He's the one who broke Batman in the book, ""Batman: Knightfall and Beyond,"" by Alan Grant. He's not supposed to be some big dumb, drooling hulk. They totally wrecked his character.Alfred is truly the only good one in this film. But then again, Alfred's always good.Don't buy this movie. It's a waste of good money."
2,The Skippable Batman,"The least of the Batman movies, which is a shame due to the caliber of talent in the secondary roles. Fine performances by Uma Thurman and Michael Gough get buried under a ponderous plot and far too many special effects that really aren't that special. That said, this is a pretty good DVD - notthing really special here. Looks pretty damn nice, though."
2,It has everything but the plot...,"Action was good, very funny, chicks were hot, the acting was well done, the lines were pretty good, and the most important thing was missing:THE PLOT!This movie had just about no plot, making it horrible! The tried to turn Batman into a comedy, failing miserably. The other three had good plots, and this one was missing that. The other three were very good, this one was horrible (notice a relationship between plot and how good the movie is?) If you really want to see this movie, don't waste money buying it. Just rent it so you can say ""might as well use that money I saved on something worthwhile."""
1,Too mind-numbing to think about...,"I'll keep this brief, as I'm still recovering. This movie has terrible acting, little to no plot, special effects that do absolutely nothing to disguse the two points mentioned above, the world's worse one-liners, and is nothing more than a coloful picture on a Burger King cup."
1,"Mr. Schumacher, we need to have a little talk . . .","Once upon a time, there was a film called Batman. It was a dark, moody film, about a dark, brooding figure trying to find some kind of revenge for the death of his parents. It was about urban decay and the need for romance and mystery in tawdry, hum-drum lives. It starred two of the greatest pieces of casting of the eighties - Keaton as Batman, and Nicholson as the Joker. And what have we arrived at? A children's film, starring superheroes who attend parties, villains who mustn't be allowed to die, and lines that Pee-wee Herman would reject as improbable. Tim Burton was the man for this series - Schumacher is not. Ladies and gentleman, I give you one of the most badly written, trashily directed, awkwardly acted, stupidly plotted, and nauseatingly conceived mangled finger-painting of a film it may ever be your misfortune to gaze upon in disbelief. Be warned."
5,Great Batman Movie Ever!,If you Have not seen Batman and Robin you need to see it! it is about Batman (Geroge Clonley) and robin (chris O'donnald) trying to save gothem city from Mr. Frezz (Aronald Swartenguzer) and trying to kill Posin Ivy (Uma Therman) Before she kills everyone from her deadly kiss! But with the help of Bat Girl (Alicia Silverstone) Can these 3 save Gothem City before it is too late and Mr. Frezz frezz everyone! this movie you have to get!
2,it is like the dark knight,"i like the movie. batman and robin have really cool stuff. the only problem is that it was descusting when robin wanted to kiss poisen ivy.returns is not bad , forever is horrible , batman is cool , begins is too into adults , dark knight is he best out of these 4.but this movie sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,bat man&robin,this movie is great but still not as good as the others but close. subzero is better.forever rocks. return and the1rstok batman and robin r all right.I like robin better but its just my opion. ps buy this
3,True Comic Book Style,"George Clooney is a very unassuming and brooding Batman. Given that, I think this film would have come off much better if Tim Burton had directed. The extravagant performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger and the films over the top slant cancels all of Clooney's efforts to explore the dark side of Batman and his motivations. Despite this, the film emerges visually as a true comic book adventure. The scene where Batman and Robin sky surf is the stuff comic books are made of. It could only have worked in this film. In all this is not a bad outing for Batman and company but perhaps it could have achieved something more lasting for the viewer."
3,Really more of a 3.9,"Okay I may be in the minority but this is actually my favorite of the Batman movies. The first two were shocking and bizarre - and a bit sick. My husband likes Michael Keaton best as Batman but he's too quirky for me, and though I like Val Kilmer in some parts he's just not Batman to me. But George Clooney had the right mix of charm and reticence and sanity. He was probably too low key for some but I thought he's was just right. And I like all the supporting cast - Alfred gets his own story (even if it is a bit hokey), Batgirl doesn't have the traditional history but Alicia Silverstone did okay, and I like Chris ____ as Robin. I even liked the villians this time - Freeze and Ivy had decent motivation for once and were amusing in their own way. Bane's the only one I really can't stand -"
1,BATMAN 4 IS THE WORST BUT DID HAVE SOME SOME GOOD MOMENTS,"Batman's fourth outing shows that Warner Bros. has some stupid writers. Overly campy, pathetic ""plot"" that is only recognized for stunning SFX, and just lame lines. I was shocked to see such respected veterans of the first two films appearing in a trashy flick. The plot is the same as FOREVER with some new villains, who played their parts well- for a horrible script. I really the special effects, but this movie deserves to be forgotten. It is a real shame that Batman turned from cool, dark, and with a touch of humor, to appear in such an atrocity. Tim Burton brought greatness to Batman, then Shumaccher(or whoever he is) screwed it up. Please come back Tim Burton and Michael Keaton!"
3,BAD MOVIE BUT DVD IS WORTH IT,"Batman and robin is the most dissapointing of all.It reminded me of the TV series. JOEL SCHUMACHER makes Batman and Robin funny characters than dark and mysterioso.The DVD is worth it because it has the ultimate bounus features but,the movie sucks."
1,What Happened?,"Unfortunately, it's only a silly waste of time. If you liked the first 3 movies, you won't like this one. Keep in mind that this was the movie that caused the Batman movie franchise to stall for 8 years."
1,SUCKIEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!! HOLY GAY JOKE BATMAN!!,hmmm what else can i say about this tripe?? its pure crap!! it sucks pure and simple..its not even worth reviewing..i mean..a frigging sing along with mr freeze?? !! WTF?!! give me some aspirin now please ! i dont know anybody who would want to buy this..even in a special edition..the casting was poor dont get me started on mr freeze or poison ivy...this film makes batman forever look good..im sure george cloony bumped this off the resume.. worts movie ever..next to showgirls thank god for graham nolan and his awesome BATMAN BEGINS single handedly brought back the dark knight to his night prowling fear inducing status..:) stay away from batman and robin !but ONLY ONE good point of this film..i liked the side story about alfred... michael gough will always be alfred in my book with michael cane being right up there as well :)
4,I Liked This one Alot,"My favorite batman to this day is Michael Keaton but George Clooney, so far, is my second favorite ( I do hear that the guy playing Batman in Batman begins is really good). This movie is really fast paced ands has some GREAT special effects. I LOVE Alicia Silverstone as BatGirl. Most Importantly my whole family loves it, so that's what counts."
1,Pathetic.,"Batman stinks alot.This movie was weak,and not very good.Don't watch any part of this trash,because its made for 2 year olds.The plot is bad,and Batman stinks.Don't watch one part of this lousy trash."
1,Should have been a trilogy,"Have these people ever even heard of Batman? Because they sure didn't make a movie about him. If I were you, I would check out some good Batman stuff. Try the first live action movie, which is good, and then try some of the GREAT Batman material. Stuff like The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, The Killing Joke by Alan Moore, and Knightfall so you can see how good a charater Bane really is (Bane is in this movie, but is about as far off base as you can get from his comic character). For a story that should have been a movie, and probably the best one, check out The Long Halloween by Jeph Loeb. One of my favorite Batman stories and a true detective story, because folks..Batman is a detective before a superhero.Batman and Robin is a superhero movie..A really, really bad one."
1,Who would have thaught Batman could be so boring.,"I love Batman. By far the best comic book hero of all time. But just because of my almost religious devotion to the dark knight, doesn't mean I'm not going to notice when a movie reaks. I saw this in the theatre and I swear I was checking my watch hoping this would end. Arnold Schwarzennegger pocketed a cool 25 million for portraying Victor Freeze. He should have had to return it to Warner Bros for the terrible job he did. As for Clooney. Keaton and Kilmer were great Batman. Clooney wouldn't make a good Alfred. Joel Shumacher is an idiot if this is the best he can do. They should have let the director of the animated cartoon make this instead of that hack. Hey was I the only one who screamed in terror when I heard Robin scream ""Cowabunga"" This is Batman not Kung Fu Turtles. If Amazon.com had a 0 star I would have used it."
2,"Great Diappointment, Movie Could Be Better","In my opinion, Joel did a reasonably good job with Batman Forever. However, with this movie he really blew it. It was a totally LOUSY movie. It was commendable that George Clooney got the idea of lightening up the mood of the character of Batman. After all, like he said, Batman wouldn't want to grieve all the time. It just isn't normal. The BIG problem was that he overdid it, and as a result the Batman we knew in the past was 'transformed' into a clown in this movie. It is indeed great that the next movie is going to be a whole lot darker than this movie. I am sure that all fans of Batman would want to see a darker version of the hero i.e as in Tim Burton's movies. I really miss the subtly moody touch of the first two Batman movies."
1,The Death of a Franchise,"What can I say I am a BIG BATMAN fan and I don't mean I'm fat, I have been a fan since I was 6 and say the TV show in reruns in the early 70's. The movie sucked no other way to say it no plot no seperation of chareter, Clooney acted like he was just collecting a check, I could go on but why. The first two were the best and Forever wasn't bad, the commen thread, Tim Burton. This guy can direct. If you love batman and have to have it at least wait until a better DVD comes out, like some real special features (hint to AOL TIME WARNER)"
5,Ths Movie Is Cool,"That idiot who said ''WORST MOVIE EVER'' is completely out of his mind.I must say the part where the city is getting thawed the guy opens the car door and ice flaps that's CHEESY!But the movie has it's cheesy,campy,corny,and hokey moments at times but otherwise it's pretty good.So ignore all those idiotic reviews who say this movie was bad because it wasn't.In my opinion the first will always be the best one and that's that.I love Mr.Freeze and I'm disappointed cause I couldn't see him on the 60's series and buy this movie if you want a good movie.BYE!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,ARNOLD AS A BAD GUY??????????,"My mom and I could not stop laughing when we saw the big bad ''Terminator''playing Mr.Freeze.The storyline was OK,but did Batman and Robin really need to act this dramatic?I just hope that they get another director for Batman 5."
1,The worst Batman film of them all. A nightmare to watch.,"This film is truly a waste of time. The acting maybe quite good (except for Arnie) but the storyline is VERY unrealistic. Who`s ever heard of Mr.Freeze anyway? Trust me on this on - do not watch it. It is truly one of the worst films I`ve ever seen, Charlie Chaplin is better!!!!!!"
3,"George is wonderful, but Arnold is a bit ""campy"".","I think George Clooney does a wonderful job picking up the role of The Caped Crusader, but the plot does not live up to the fabulous sets. Arnold Schwarzenegger unfortunately had bad luck with his script writer--50% of his lines are really cheesy puns. Uma Thurman did a great job as well as Alicia Silverstone and Chris O'Donnell. Final analysis: Rent, don't buy!"
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I saw this movie when it first came out on the big screen in June of 1997. I wasn't expecting much, and I wasn't disappointed. This movie is awful! There is no plot; most of the dialogue consists of one-liners and bad jokes; there are far too many gratuitous butt-shots; and most of the acting is so bad that it makes what you might see at a high school play look professional. While there are a few good scenes between Bruce Wayne and Alfred, even these are spoiled by the frequent inclusion of hallucinations of scenes from Bruce Wayne's past (none of which, incidentally, seemed to have anything to do with his decision to become Batman.) Don't waste your money on this movie. END"
1,Very unhappy,I was very upset to discover that when my son finally opened it to watch that it was only the special features disc.not the actual DVD.
1,It is scratched on all the CDs !!,It sucks because it is scratched all over all the CDs that they have it also has 1 layer of paper for protection
2,.....?,"Pretty questionable movie here. How questionable might you ask? Bad enough to the point where they had another Batman movie written and decided to cancel it. This movie runs off of one liners....the whole time. The plot is descent, but the one liners and acting impact it negatively. I only say its worth the buy if you'd like to reminisce on the movie from when you were younger."
2,Ouch!,"So much has already been spewed about this turkey, which leaves me with little to add. Arnie and Uma are the only bright stars here (hence the 2 stars); the ice effects and Freeze's costume were awesome and Ivy DID have nice horns. ...but... Yep, there area buts (and butts) here. I appreciated the movie's cheezy quality because I love the 60's TV show, but the motorcycle contest with Robin and Batgirl blew chunks (the day glow paint was nice); Bane as a mindless tard blew bigger chunks; George Clooney is the cheesiest, emo actor in Hollywood and he made Batman blow the largest, greasiest chunks of all...and the nipples on the suit...bwahahaha!...such a sad ending to a promising franchise that would wait nearly a decade (God, maybe IT was an entire decade!) before Bats appeared on the BIG SCREEN again."
2,"Uma Thurman, the Best Thing in Here, is Awful","Uma Thurman has little to do but strut around in spandex and ""seduce"" the dynamic duo (I've seen more inspired love-sick expressions on my dog as he eats) and Arnold Schwartzenegger is downright pitiful. He's not funny, he's not cold, hell, he's not even frozen!As for Alicia Silverstone? Nice try, but let's stick to Clueless type films and Aerosmith videos.George Clooney? He was just too... boring sounded. He never seemed like he was having fun, while Chris O'Donnell took every oppurtunity to bitch about how great he would be on his own. Vendella and Elle Macpherson should also come to realize the ""Cindy Crawford"" film rule: supermodels are not actresses.Memo to Joel Schumacher- Batman Forever: good. BAtman & Robin: Bad. Next time, why not just have it Batman & Poison Ivy. No, let's just have it Poison Ivy!"
2,It was fair,I agree that the movie wasn't a oscar winner but I liked it because it was more like the old comic books. I think that was the idea to make it like a comic book.
2,Serious lack of direction and purpose,"They should turn the making of any future Batman movie over to a new team of director/produers, cause the Schumacher studio have obviously run out of steam/ideas etc.Here's a great concept for free: Ressurect The Joker and have him played by Jim Carrey! He's the only actor that could portray The Joker as he's featured in the comics, but since his movie career handn't started when the first movie was made they had to choose a differnt approach and portrayal of The Joker that would suit Nicholson acting style."
1,You can make better things out of Bat Droppings,Holy Bad Movie Batman. This a collection of actors (you might like) destroy the batman franchise. Skip this one if your a fan of Batman.
3,Don't Blame George Clooney,"After all the hype and anticipation, seeing George Clooney as Batman was disappointing. I think Clooney did all he could to keep Batman going, but with a poor script and even less dialogue than the other movies, he did the best he could. Like James Bond, there are certain actors who are Batman, and Clooney is Bruce Wayne. He was just saddled with a poor script and the director's desire for more special effects than ever before. Don't blame George Clooney for the fall of the Batman series; blame the writers and director. George Clooney is Bruce Wayne and with a better script, could've turned this franchise into a dynasty. END"
1,Worst Batman Ever - Top 7 Reasons Why,"In no particular order:1. Mr. Freeze wears polar bear slippers!2. Batman and Robins' costumes have nipples.3. George Clooney - good actor, very bad Batman.4. Chris O'Donnell - once again, good actor, very bad Robin.5. The dialogue was terrible. Ex: Mr. Freeze yelling ""Kill da heroes!""6. Bane was a mindless brute who did next to nothing. For those of you not familiar with who he was in the comics, he was extremely intelligent and he broke Batman's back for cryin' out loud!7. Plastic lips?! Is there a deleted scene where Batman watches 'Get Smart' before going against Poison Ivy?"
1,Oh god. Why? Why?,Every single person involved in the writing of the dialogue in this movie should be forever banned from the film business.
1,"Holy Crapfest, Batman!","This film needed a cameo by Adam West and Burt Ward just to let us know that this was a remake of the 60's TV show! If viewed with this in mind it's a fairly desent movie. But it was very painful to watch one of the most powerful movie franchise's of the late 80's & 90's go straight to Hell. Everything that Frank Miller, Anton Furst, Tim Burton, Neil Adams, Denny O'neil and all the rest of the people who resurrected the Batman name was shot down with this abomination of celuloid.Thank God Warner Bros. had the good sense to let Batman have an eight year rest until Batman Begins was made."
4,Not as bad as people portray,"Batman and Robin has plenty of big name actors, George Clooney plays a good batman, Uma Thurman is extremely attractive as Poison Ivy and Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good Mr. Freeze. It does not have the same intense drama of Dark Night but its a entertaining movie to watch. Also there are plenty of one liners to make you laugh."
1,CIRQUE DU SOLEIL: BATMAN AND ROBIN,"When this movie came out in theaters, I was 10 years old so of course I was excited, seeing Batman and Robin do all those acrobatic acts to defeat evil. Then Batgirl joins to fight become the triumverate of good against evil and all three of them shaking hands showing Gotham has three heroes now watching the streets...yeah, I was 10 and watching this movie again now, Mr. Schumacher, the Cirque du Coleil manager called: he wants his set back. WHAT IN THE HELL WAS GOING ON IN THAT MOVIE? This is not the batman: he has a nipple stand throughout the movie, for christ's sake. They usually give an epidural for this kind of torture. The days of Schumacher are over, may they rest in peace.In comes Christopher Nolan, our messiah, one small step for man, on giant leap for batmankind!"
1,Please get Michael Keaton and Tim Burton for the next film,Will somebody please get Michael Keaton back as Batman. And how about getting Jack Nicolson to once again play the Joker. And Tim Burton to direct.It will be the best batman yet combining REAL talent and the orignal movie formula.I am sure people wont think of my idea as a repeat but rather as a blessing because every new batman movie except the first gets worse. Batman And Robin was the worst and only Schwarzenegger 's character saved it.
1,Have You Ever Loved A Puppy?,"Although Batman and Robin was a mockery, of a tragedy, of a film it did have it's high points. Like when the credits first rolled. Imagine it. You're back in that theater, the lights dim. You're an avid Batman fan. The opening credits roll and the title flashes, BATMAN AND ROBIN. You almost throw your popcorn in the air with anticipation. And then the movie started and you caught up on some lost hours of sleep. But the n movie ended, and that same feeling came back. Because you stared death in the face and survived. Ahh, to be young again."
2,"Holy Creative Fiascos, Batman!","This is a perfect example of how even the most popular film franchises can be ruined by forgetting what made them work. Gone is Tim Burton's provacative exploration of the soul of the Dark Knight; here instead is a one-dimensional festival of agrivating camp and visual overkill. The acting is paper-thin (except for Uma Thurman and George Clooney who, although he's good, can never match Michael Keaton's brilliant performance in Burton's two modern classics), the action is far too over-the-top, and the entire movie is completely empty. Next time, Warner Brothers should ditch Joel Schumacher and bring back Burton!"
1,The Worst Film I've Ever Seen,"This is the worst film I've ever seen. Watching this film is like watching someone burning millions of dollars in cash before your very eyes. In other words, it's a loud, boisterous spectacle that is also depressing. It's so horrible that I almost cried. Seeing a once respectable film franchise being mercilously slaughtered is a grim experience. While watching this film, one feels that the director had a deep, dark, personal contempt for the Batman franchise, and that this film was part of his ""master plan"" to destroy it.Most of this film's cast has gone on to do bigger and better things. This is the one miracle to emerge from this disaster; one would think that this film would be career suicide for any accomplished actor. Oddly enough, the cast survived to do other movies. Yes, it's that bad.And now there is a two disc special edition! How did such a thing happen?"
1,Question for the director.,I want to hear the Joel Schumacker commentary just so he can justify in my head why the bat suit had nipples.I would have given this less stars but that was as low as I could go.
1,WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK,"One of the worst movies in motion picture history, the only redeeming quality that this ""film"" has is its fantastic use for a ""Bad Movie Night"" to have with friends. This movie made me outright angry when I went to go see it in the theater and the only way I have enjoyed B&R; is to joke about it and I have yet to find a movie that is so perfect for doing just that!!If you want a good movie:RECOMMEND TO AVOID AT ALL COSTSIf you want a movie to razz and make fun of:A+++"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND BUDGET MONEY,"This movie sucks and is a shame because Batman started out so great and just got worse over time. George Clooney was okay in From Dusk till Dawn, but is dreadful in this movie and every other one he has been in. Robin should have been left out of this fourth Batman film because he is the worst character. It is too bad to because Robin was so cool in the comic books and he should have been the same way in the movies. Batgirl sucked too. Christian Bale will hopefully save the franchise with his portrayal of Batman which will I hope will be a dark, morbid throwback to the Michael Keaton days! Thank you Warner Bros. for my giving me back my DARK KNIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A sad ending for a great franchise.,"This fourth addition to the Batman franchise is the one to blame for bringing a great franchise to a sad and dismal ending to a legendary movie legacy. This movie absolutely fails on every front and in every possible way. The whole idea of Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze teaming up seems completely out of line as plants and cold temperatures do NOT mix, except maybe for pine or evergreen trees. This movie also is destroyed from the very beginning by a really weak cast and even the better actors involved give miserable performances in their characters. Even the background music fails as well. I can't believe that the movie franchise went from a dark and moving start with 1989's ""Batman"" and came crashing down to the ground with this trendy MTV-Oriented ""Batman & Robin"". A terrible end to such a great superhero. Even ""Batman Forever"" was miles above this garbage."
1,When marketing met special effects.......,"This one was putrid, okay? There was no attempt to find good actors, to write a decent plot, or to do anything but squeeze more characters in that could be turned into action figures for sale. Clooney was an unimpressive Batman, Robin came off as a vinidctive li'l brat, and the ""villians"" were plodding and sophomoric. It is so bad that I seriously wonder why anyone would give it more than a 1. When will Hollywood learn that special effects and potty humor can never replace a good story well told? My cat could have made a better movie."
1,An adomination,"I tried; I really did, to come up with some sort of redeeming factor. A really funny line, a well done custom , a well choreographed fight seen, anything... Unfortunately there is not a single redeeming factor anywhere in this film.Denis O'Neil in the afterward to his excellent ""Knightfall"" novalisation talks of how despite the wide variety of incarnations Batman has gone through (even Adam West) his soul has maintained intact throughout all of them. That is not the case here. The people behind this movie has amazingly managed to make a ""Batman"" movie that is less in tune with who Batman is than Adam West as a self mocking comedian who dances around in tights in the daylight while Robin sprouts out horrible puns.Often a ""die hard"" fan will feel the need to see everything related to Batman ""just because."" Save yourself the trouble here, this film has nothing to do with the Batman."
1,Do not buy this,"The only positive aspect of this thing's creation, was that it was such a terrible movie, the franchise had to be rebooted. Thankfully we now have Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two of the best comic-hero movies ever made(and the best film of 2008, sorry Slumdog.) So if you really need a classic Batman fix, buy and watch the 1989 Tim Burton film followed by a viewing of The Dark Knight. Enjoying and examining the differences of those two films would be a much better use of your cinematic time."
3,Not that stupid.,"Batman & Robin got some of the worst reviews of the Batman series so I had to see this film for myself and to my surprise, this 4th installment isn't that dreadful. Uma Thurman and Chris O'Donnell are the best actors in this action adventure, I love Poison Ivy! Thurman is a hoot as the seductive femme fatale. Alicia Silverstone should have never been cast as Batgirl, she's so boring in this. Arnold is a ham so I expected him to act like a clown. I am not a George Clooney fan at all, he's the worst batman ever! This movie is a mixed bag, decide for yourself."
1,Simply Avoid,Avoid it like it's your worst nightmare. It's THAT horrendous. Stick with the Tim Burton versions and leave this one (along with Batman Forever) out in the freezing cold/scorching asphalt.
3,Not as good as it souould be for a Final Installment,"I cerntnly hope their will somewear in time be a Batman V, Becuase if this as the fina installyment it sure could have fooled me if I wasent familler with the Batman world.Since this was ovesly the Final Installment, there is always the BIG SECRET!! of something always missing! I know this is usealy only play in Triligys but from Star Wars to Psycho and Scream 3 there is always some sort of secret always reveled..In this nothing at all, I think Coleny makes a good Bruce Wayne but just like they pretty much did in Batman I stick with the stuntduble for the actual Batman.....Arnold does his usealy good job and Gothem city is no longer a dark,cold,snowy and a place thats constantly in the cross fire of evil plans it seems like anymore. Its a bright city.....All in all get it if you want"
2,THE WORST MOVIE OF 1997,This is the worst movie i ever seen becase its a very bad movie that i would not buy.
2,"A useful film, if applied correctly","Now that waterboard torture has been banned a proposal that this film should be used as a replacement has been whispered in the dark halls of the Pentagon. Highly classified reports, exposed at great risk by agents of TCSSAASSG (The Canadien Super Secret Agent And Skateboard Society Guys), tell of sickingly sinister experiments where foreign extremists are repeatedly shown this film using the Clockwork Orange Ludovico Treatment eyelids clamped open method. Even the most hardened are completely broken down blathering idiots after an average of 5.34 hours continous exposure. After several days of quiet recuperation just the mention of another ""Treatment"" is enough to pry the deepest secrets from the previously unreachable buried vault in their conniving brains. Reports also tell of those exposed waking up from nightmares incoherently crying and screaming of visions of closeups of rubber clad crotches, butts and nipples."
2,"Badly casted, embarassment to Batman","This is a dreadful film DO NOT spend your money on it. Arnold was a terrible choice for mr.freeze he is good in action films but made a dreadful Victor Fries. I give it a two instead of one because Poison Ivy [Uma Thurman] was ok. I am not big on robin as a character batman is better by himself. George Clooney is a good actor, but did not make a good batman leave Batman to Michael Keaton."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS EGGS!,"I hate this film. It is a piece of crap. Terribly acted, terribly cast, terrible effects, terrible story, and terrible atmosphere. Avoid at all costs and stick withe the two Tim Burton Batman movies and the new Batman Begins."
2,"BAD DVD, BAD MOVIE","THIS MOVIE WAS STUPID. THE ARE TWO PARTS IN THE FILM THAT I LIKED WAS: SPECIAL EFFECTS, AND AT THE START WHEN THE WARNER BROS MORPHES IN THE BAT.THIS MOVIE WAS A BIG BLOCKBUSTER BUT IT TURNED INTO A FLOP. THE ACTORS WERE GOOD. BUT WHY DID BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN AND ROBIN THIS FILM GO SO FAR IN THE FUTURE HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN 1,2 WERE IN THE 40S HOW IN THE WORLD GO SO FAR IN THE FUTURE. JOEL SCHMACHER IS A WERID DIRECTOR.TIM BURTON THE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST 2 DID THE BEST JOB. I WANTED HIM TO DIRECT 3,4 BUT JOEL SCHMACHER WANTED IT.BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS WAS IN A DARK SIDE OF THE WORLD. AND BATMAN FOREVER AND BATMAN AND ROBIN WERE IN A LIGHT SIDE OF THE WORLD.TRUST ME THIS FILM IS WAIST OF TIME. SEE BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS THEIR BETTER....."
1,Worst Batman ever.,"This was one of the worst Batman movies that was ever made,ever.I hated the script,and the action.This movie could'vebeen alot more good If they had another Director,and someone else to play Batman.Out of Five stars, this movie gets a One."
1,This movie is BEYOND bad!,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The attemp at ""camp"" is even bad. Don't waste your time with this one...Buy Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park instead. At least that one never attempted to be legit..."
1,What happend?!?!,"This has got to be the WORST batman yet..This movie is filled with the worst acting I have ever seen. And who thought it would be a good idea to cast Arnold as freeze? BIG MISTAKE. Same with Uma.. I liked her in her other films but she was HORRIBLE in this one.. I really wish Tim burton did back off on the last two.. Anyway, Don't waste your money on this garbage!!"
2,A Bad Movie!,"This is the worst Batman movie I have ever seen! I am a big Batman fan and in this movie they just make a fool out of him! When I think of Gotham, I think of a dark, crime-infested town. But in this movie Gotham is a colorful, present day city instead of the 1960s type Gotham I know of. Also the script was horrible, the worst I've ever heard! The only reason I gave this movie two stars was because of the cool costumes, but overall this movie ....!"
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen!,"I only have to say that when I went to the theater to watch this, for the first time in my life, I seriously thought of getting out. I only stayed because I wasn&#65533;t alone. Anyway, avoid this trash and stick with Batman, Batman Returns, and even with Batman Forever. R.I.P. Batman."
1,Make it Stop! MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (zero stars),"............NOOOOOOOOO!!!! This series even further demises than before!! This could be the worst movie I have ever seen. Wow. Talk about COMPLETLEY losing all of the edge, the darkness, and the evil that was found in the first two films. I'd rather watch ""Pearl Harbor"" five times in a row..."
1,This is bad.,"I repeat this movie is phemoninaly bad. It's terrible. Where is good old Tim Burton when you need him. I strongly advise you not to waste your time or money on this trash. Too bad zero stars is not an option, because I'd give it to this terrible movie. This is the worst movie I have seen sinceI can't remember!"
1,Oh dear...,"I certainly didn't expect much from this movie, as I knew how poorly it had been treated by critcs and the public alike, but this unfortunate film could not even meet my already low expectations. The acting was poor all around, with flat jokes and cliches abounding. The sets, tastelessly overdone with neon lighting and mismatched coloration, were often painful to view. Even the special effects, which might have redeemed an otherwise mediocre movie, were far below the current industry standard. The vehicles, particularly, looked entirely unconvincing, resembling (perhaps intentionally) plastic toys. I don't think the storyline and plot even deserve mention: there was no suspense or tension, and no character (including Batman) ever had much to say beyond the corniest imaginable quips and puns. The only upside to the film is that the viewer may find him or herself laughing during the movie (as did I and several friends), not because of any humorous dialogue, but because it was so TERRIBLE!"
1,I thought it was just like the third one!,"This was the worst Batman movie I have ever seen. It's just like Batman Forever except new characters. The acting is bad, it doesn't have a good plot, and the whole movie is just plain dumb. Alicia Silverstone was pretty disappointed I bet when she had to play in this movie. What are they going to do now make a fifth one and have a new charcter named Batgirl in it? If I were you don't even think about wasting your money on this movie because it's the worst Batman sequel ever made, stick with the others."
1,Bat-Fan,"What were they thinking? This movie was all wrong from the beginning. The origins of the three villains was wrong. Batgirl is Barbara Gordon not Barbara Wilson, Alfred Pennyworth had no living relatives. The Dialogue was pathetic. If the movie was darker and the dialogue believable it might have worked. I just hope that the sequel to Batman Begins doesn't become a dissapointment. The fans can't deal with that again. Trust me."
1,"Some days, you just can't get rid of a BOMB","Batman and Robin is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Where to begin? Hammy acting from the worst possible choice for Mr. Freeze (Patrick Stewart was tapped for the role, but was busy with another film), the degradation of the Bane character into a monosyllabic, rubber-suited buffoon, far too much neon, tight-fitting rubber costumes with **nipples** (shudder)...no, there is far, far too much wrong with this film. George Clooney was not playing Batman, he was playing Adam West playing Batman, and he was doing a terrible job of it. If the moviemakers had decided whether they wanted a serious film, or a campy parody of comic books, like the 1960s TV show, then it might have had some potential. Unfortunately, the constant waffling between seriousness and camp, along with all the other myriad flaws, make this not just a bad movie, but downright painful to watch."
1,pure dreck,"i don't know why clooney was chosen for batman. his everyman feel and charm just don't suit the dark knight's personality. i really missed michael keaton's machiavellian performance in this movie. as for schwarzenegger as freeze.....puh-leeze. the accent was very difficult to wade through, so most of his dialogue in that plastic fishbowl on his head was garbled at best. there are other massively-built actors that could've filled the shoes more effectively. and uma thurman as poison ivy.....yeech. i don't find her seductive or charming. and she's just not evil enough. the villains for this movie were too cartoonish. the heroes were not very heroic. and the color was too annoying. reminded me too much of the dick tracy movie."
1,Don't waste your time!,"George Clooney as Batman? BARF! Chris O'Donnel as Robin is sooo annoying. Schwartzegger is passable as Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman is HOT as Poison Ivy and Alica Silverstone is piping hot as Batgirl. What's the plot? NONE! Forget it!"
1,"This movie totally ruins batman, bring back Tim Burton!","OK...I loved Batman, I loved Batman Returns, Batman Forever was okay, but it still didn't have that unique style of Tim Burton...but now this movie just sucked. It really ruined gotham. In Batman and Batman Returns gotham was always dark and it was always christmas and even though it was the eighties everyone dressed like they were from 1945. That was great stuff. Now on this movie batwoman, who really shouldn't have been brought into the movie, was motorcycle racing and robin was beating up neon gang members. It looked like the year 2000! And in Batman bruce wayne was actually human, on this he's some kind of super hero. He's like jumping forty feet, and then robin gets frozen and thawed out, that's just extremely unrealistic. Please please bring Tim Burton Back, and michael keaton."
3,"Goham City looks great, as for the plot.....","This movie lacks in story and plot, I personally think that the action is fun to watch, but not a classic like the first Batman films. I think that Joel Shumacher isn't at fault, It's the script writers fault. I think he had a good vision in mind but the story that the lousy script writers wrote was trash and should of been abandoned. Maybe since Tim Burton wasen't co-producing this one went bad. The only positives of this movie is the special effects, good set design, and a wonderfully creative score by Elliot Goldenthal. This movie is eye-candy but an extreme dissapointment in the plot section."
2,Could go on,"Honestly, I could go on about this movie. It's done in such poor taste. For starts it's a big cartoon with the action sequences. Clooney seems uncomfortable as Batman while Schwarzenegger goes overboard as Mr. Freeze. Thurman is the same as Poison Ivy. The story is just laughable. It's thin and incohesive. What was Schumacher on?... Given two stars because of the stunning visual effects, the only asset saving this from being bottom of the barrel."
1,A remake of the campy TV show not the comic,"Complete and utter camp. The set of Batman movies by Joel Shumacher are transitioning to the campy television show from the 60's with the cameo guest villains and cheesy, yet colorful (literally), diabolical plots. There are hints of the first two movies but its only the background upon which this is placed. I seriously believe that this movie was made only for the promotional money they exacted from Taco Bell. The only Batman that followed the original's lead is the animated series. Its a little lighter because its an 'American cartoon' but ""Mask of the Phantasm"" is great and ""Batman: Subzero"" is everything this movie should have been.Shame on you Joel Shumacher."
2,What happened to the Batman franchise?,"This is absoultely the worst Batman of all. The makers of Batman&Robin took the new and stylized look of Batman Forever and went to far! George Clooney is ceratinly no Batman. Robin is just annoying(unlike in Batman Forever). And even the idea of Batgirl is stupid. The film is filled with cheezy comic relife, and bad and boring action. When is saw this I said where is te fun that was in the first three. Batman fans are advised to stay away from this trash. The only high points are that the film is occasionly fun and some of Gotham's looks are pleasing to the eye."
2,Losing The Touch,"Well, it finally happened. The Batman line of movies lost steam. I remember looking at this around Christmas 1998 and thought it stunk. It is not true to the comic book or the movies before this one. The one thing that got me was that, What are Batman and Robin doing out in public at a social function? Batman and Robin are vigilantes, and they stay away from the public eye. Also, the Character Bane is way off the mark of the comic book. He is portrayed as a lackey who can only say one or two words. He should have been given his own movie because in the comic book, he broke Batman's back. And why did we make Batgirl/Barbara, a relative of Alfred's. In the comic books, she is Commisioner Gordon's daughter. In the past, I let the minor variations slid, but this movie goes beyond minor. It ruins the mystique of the Batman legend. I just hope they don't make another sequel."
1,"Jesus, what a terrible movie!!!",Although starring George Clooney and Arni this movie was a total catastrophe!!! DON'T WATCH IT!!!
1,Batman and Robin: An Epic Disaster,"If making bad films is an expertise, than Joel Shumacher is GOD!! How could any human being, living or dead, have any less of a clue about film making than Joel. Batman and Robin has leapt up and completely annhialated the original concept of Batman in one neon covered swoop. Batman's creator Bob Kane must be furious to see what a hash that hack Joel has done to an empire of class and high standards. I would analize the plot, but I couldn't seem to find one when I was watching it."
1,100 megaton bomb of a movie,"I resisted seeing this movie in the theatres but finally broke down and rented it on video. I had heard it was bad but nothing could prepare me for the sheer stench this movie gave off. Being a big Batman fan (Tim Burton's version anyway) this just disgusted me. With the kind of budget B&R had and the quality of the actors there was no excuse for this travesty. Bad plot, hokey acting, stupid dialoge. Errh! Just makes me mad thinking about it. Undoubtebly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Joel Shumacher should be banished to Siberia!!"
1,Watch Spawn instead,"Batman and Robin was an extremely corny and dumb movie. The acting was poor and the story was even worse. The usually good Joel Schumacher hurt the movie with sideways camera angles and a fake looking Gotham City. George Clooney isn't quite as good as Val Kilmer as Batman and is nowhere near the standards of Michael Keaton. And why is Bruce Wayne looking cheerful?! The only reason he became Batman in the first place was because of his parents' deaths. He seems to have forgotten they were deceased. It's hard to believe the movie's budget was 110 million dollars. I hear Schumacher wants to place an unknown teenage actor as Batman/Bruce Wayne for the next Batman movie. That is only going to make the movie worse, and with an unknown actor, the movie might not even gross 30 million dollars!! For a much better (although not excellent) comic book movie, watch Spawn, which has a better plot and great special effects on a much, much lower budget."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"This is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life. I was obsessed with Batman enough to see it more than once and confirm the fact that this was just a terrible movie. I know this isnt coming off constructive, but anyone who has seen this film knows what I'm talking about. Joel Schumacher is a great director... infact, one of my favorites. Batman? Not the film for him. I wish they had ended his riegn of terror with Batman Forever. Though, Batman Forever was no where near this terrible... I saw it coming... there were signs like neon lights everywhere, overexaggerated landscapes, nipple on the batsuit, Robin, Batmobile scaling wall, and especially the poor story line. As I watched Batman Forever, I knew that it was only a matter of time before Batman clapped his boots together to activate his ice skates. I hope Warner Bros have learned their lesson and follow a more successful path with the Batman Begins sequels."
1,By far the worst Batman movie or movie ever made,"Batman and Robin is no doubt the worst movie ever made next to House of the Dead. The movie is a real fiasco with cheesy graphics,truly bad acting,a bad cast(especially Arnold Schwarzenegger as the villian Mr.Freeze),and the worst part was the movie had no plot or point at all, It feels like your watching an old Batman TV show. Its a mystery how George Clooney,Chris O'Donnell,Uma Thurman,Alicia Silverstone,and Arnold Scwarzenegger got their careers back in order after this bomb. Please avoid at all costs and if it's TV don't watch it and read a book instead. This movie makes Howard the Duck look like a Best Picture winner. Reviewed by Skippy Johnson"
1,bad.,"This was a bad movie,and its for kids.This movie can't be recommended to anyone because its bad.One out of five stars"
1,"Golly Geez Batman, this movie stinks",All I can say about this movie is that is sucks big time! I thought Uma and Arnold did a decent job but the storyline and the other actors just didn't make it interesting. The picture and sound in this movie is fantastic though.I was very disappointed with this one. Do yourself a favor and rent it or borrow it before you lay the cash down for it.
1,I walked out,"The first Batman film was great, the second one was pretty good, the third one was bad but tolerable, but this one.... I admit it, I did'nt listen to anyone. I went to see this trainwreck of a movie at the theatre despite all the warnings. What an over-blown mess! I walked out right after the scene with the Ice-Batmobile or whatever it was, I could'nt take any more stupidity. The best actor in this mess was the guy who played Bane - he delivered his lines perfectly: ""EEEEEUUUUGHARGH!"" As for the rest of the cast: The Arnold was almost passable as Mr. Freeze, almost. George Clooney was a very bland Batman and O'Donnel needs another job, he's no good as Robin any more. I think that Mr. Freeze should have sealed Alicia Silverstone and Umma Thurman in a block of ice forever! What a bunch of Hams! Save your money, don't buy this crazy garbage.I would'nt be surprised if another Batman film is never made due to this mess."
2,Not Bad,"Quite humorous, actually. It was funny to see The Governator playing such a goober. Alicia Silverstone & Uma were hot, of course. Entertaining."
1,i have seen it,"batman and robin is very good the mr freeze,poisnivy and bane the batman and robin keeps a power the mr freeze was kept in jail but posin ivy saved him"
1,AHAHAHAHAHHAH,"THIS MOVIE IS SO HORRIBLE THAT ITS SOO HILARIOUS!!! GEORGE CLOONEY AS BATMAN, ARE YOU KIDDIN ME?? LOL LOL LOL, MAN THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC. ITS SOO STUPID YOU WANNA CRY YOUR EYES OUT WITH LAUGHTER!I THINK THE BEST PARRY WAS... THIS IS WHY SUPERMAN WORKS ALONE. AAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHATHIS MOVIE IS WORTH EVERY CENT OF DUMBA**SNESS."
2,Another bad Batman movie,"I did like this film some but it's not a great movie. In this movie MR Freeze blanketed Gotham City with ice that he shot out of the telescope. It is impossible to shoot ice through a telescope. That was stupid. When Batman tried to thaw Gotham by shooting sunlight out of the telescope, that would've been possible.In a scene Bruce Wayne told Dick Grayson that Alfred was dying. During this scene, George Clooney had a smirk on his face. That was bad acting on Clooney's part and bad directing on Schumacher's part. This entire scene should've been reshot.Batgirl starred in this film. But she didn't become Batgirl until around the end of the movie. And she wore a tiny mask instead of a cowl that I expected her to have.I didn't hate Batman & Robin but I have to admit that it wasn't a good movie. I give it a 2 star rating."
3,Not so bad.,"This movie has possibly the greatest sequence ever captured on film. I am, of course, referring to the Poison Ivy - Gorilla strip scene set to the wild arabian music. I nearly jumped out my seat in the theater!Sadly, she is the only saving grace in this film, well aside from Chris O'Donnell's body in that suit.Clooney and Schwarznigger were horrid! Though Arnie's speech impediment is quite hilarious. Especially when he instructing his goons to sing by shouting, ""Thing! Thing!"" Too funny.Alicia Silverstone, or 'Chubs' as I like to call her is an absolute bore! Bane was poorly misused as well.Still, I rate this higher then the nearly unwatchable Batman Forever. However, all the film really cannot beat Batman Returns. That film was absolutely brilliant."
3,"Not bad, not good and not one of the worst super hero movies ever","The Incrediable Hulk takes the nod for me as worst super hero movie ever; This movie was funny due to Arnold's famous one liners that made him a faviorte in the over blown 80's action films like Commando and Predator. The acting was very cheesy and predictable, but there is some parts that boggles my mind...GEORGE CLOONEY AS BATMAN?! How they decide on Clooney? He is probably the worst choice for Batman, the addition of Batgirl made the movie over crowded, and they killed Bane by pulling a cord? Why not try that earlier? Thats like killing Jason from Friday the 13th with a butter knife! The end with Freeze in his suit at prision was anther, what the heck were they thinking moment? They change into new suits at the last major fight scene for no reason whatsoever, but other then that the movie was still enjoyable. Not as bad as people make it to be."
2,"GEORGE CLOONEY is a Good BATMAN, but BATGIRL Movie Sinks!","The Villains ruined the movie. Nobody cared for Mr. Freeze or Poison Ivy. It's no classic Joker (Nicholson) or Catwoman (Pfiefer). George Clooney was a great BATMAN, dark and full of energy, but did not get enough credit, due to a very, very bad movie and bad costume. I would have enjoyed the movie more if they stayed to the comic books on the ""Batgirl"" story. Barbara Gordon, the Commisioner's daughter would have been more interesting to watch then Barbara Wilson, Alfred's niece (Alicia Silverstone). Best BATGIRL Costume was on the ""Lady Shiva"" episode of the really bad show, BIRDS OF PREY with Dina Meyer. This movie is only for hardcore Batman fans, but I would stick to BATMAN & BATMAN RETURNS for your DVD Collection."
1,It hurts to see a Knight fall....,"This movie should not have gotten made. In a way, I'm thankful: if not for this complete flop, Batman Begins would not have happened. It just hurts to see a great hero like Batman get treated so badly. I'm sure if Bob Kane were still alive he'd sue Schummie for all he's worth. This movie is too corwded: 3 heroes, 3 vilains, in 2 hours. not enough room for character development but plenty of time for poorly executed gimics like credit cards whose expiration reads ""Forever""! Trsut me, this one movie to avoid, or if you watch it, only watch it to mock its horridness."
1,"Holy bad movie, batman!","Didn't Arnold Schwarzenegger once say that after the first ""Terminator"" movie that he would never play a villian again? Well, he went back on his word when he plays ""Mr. Freeze"" in this, perhaps the last batman movie ever.Posion Ivy tries to woo both Batman and Robin and even Mr. Freeze himself. The only good thing about the movie is the scence-stealing Gotham City landscape. and SOMEONE needs to explain the reason for editing."
2,What were they thinking?,"I actually was not disappointed by this film. The Trailer made the movie look stupid and it was. However, I was actually surprised what I actually did like about it. Arnold, while still acting like every other Shumacher villain actually had some good scenes; the Sculpting of the Ice globe in Arkham, learning his wife was dead; and the only problem with Clooney was the script and direction. The same goes for Uma and Michael Gough. the biggest Problem, besides the script and director, was Alicia Silverstone as a really annoying person who thought she was Batgirl. Also Elliot Goldenthal's music is no match for Danny Elfman's contributions.The lack of extras makes the DVD pretty boring."
1,Some people should know when to give it up.,"Bad-bad-bad movie. Word of helpful advice: AVOID AT ALL COST.Uma Thurman, George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, Alicia Silverstone and Arnold Schwarzenegger could not save this movie from becoming a box office bomb."
1,"It's not ONLY the worst ""Batman"" ever made...","I won't be very original saying this, but that's not only the worst Batman ever made (even the TV series was better) but also the worst movie I've ever seen. They even made Bane (an intelligent, sophisticated and educated man) into a brainless zombie on steroids. Please, someone resurrect the Joker, so he can take out Clooney's ""Batman"", O'Donnell's ""Robin"", and especially the annoying team of Silverstone & Thurman - they're responsible in 40% for making this movie such a pile of waste. But, of course, the ones who deserve to be given a dose of Smilex are the two people responsible for killing the Batman series - director Schumacher and writer Goldsman (or whatever their names are spelled). For God's sake, bring back Tim Burton and Michael Keaton before Goldsman & Co. try to prove that they can make a Batman movie worse than ""Batman & Robin"" (and I'm sure they can!)."
2,Worst Batman flick ever,"The Batman movies used to be some of the best made up until ""Batman & Robin"" came out. I liked the original ""Batman"" movie and ""Batman Forever,"" but ""Batman & Robin"" is one of the most overrated movies ever, if not the most. Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy are unconvincing character additions that should have been left out. Clooney and O'Donnel also don't act good enough for them to be the duo of Batman & Robin. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl also isn't convincing and would be better left out of the movie. This is without a doubt the worst that the Batman series has ever produced and maybe the most overrated movie of all time. I don't recommend this movie to nobody, it's a waste of a couple of hours. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because some of the special effects were cool, such as when Mr. Freeze froze something, but that's about the only good thing about the movie. ""Batman & Robin"" is a major embarrasment to what used to be a good series of movies."
1,What the hell happened to Batman,"Well, Batman has hit an all time low with this film. There are so many things wrong with this film that it is to much to list. But this piece of filmaking crap actually did some things right, they arent major things done right or the movie would have been decent. one thing that i liked was some of the things Arnold did with Mr. Freeze, it showed how much he cared for his wife and the thing he makes in the prison which is a nice touch to Freeze. The other thing i liked was Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. She played the part well to bad it wasnt in a better movie. George Cloony plays a crappy Batman, he doesnt even have a dark Batman voice. And Chris O' Donnel plays a whiny and annoying Robin who just wont shut the hell up. I dont recommend this shame on the Batman series but watch it if you just have to see all the Batman movies."
1,Talk about a complete 180...,"Standing directly opposite from Tim Burton's magnificent Batman & Batman Returns is this sorry piece of trash. While Batman Forever - as bad as it was - at least made *some* attempt to balance the cheesiness with some kind of serious drama, this movie jettisons all pretense of intelligence and depth. Blaming the actors for their performances is pointless and unfair, as they had a) a remarkably stupid story to work from (even making allowances for typical action movie plots), b) inane dialoge to utter and c) horrible direction by Schumacher. This movie truly is style over substance, and it's not even good style at that. The sets are ugly, the effects unimpressive and obnoxious, and the whole look of the film is enough to give one a headache. It doesn't get much worse than this."
1,Batman was not inspired by neon,"When the change of directors brought us Batman Forever, I didn't mind too much what was done with the character. The extra colors in some parts (like the blacklit Robin / Street Gang fight) was kinda cool, but didn't seem right. With this film, everything about Batman was perverted into a too-cute version of a childrens comic book. Batman, who was driven by his parents death, ceased being the dark nightmare that he is supposed to be. The banter between EVERYONE, that means sidekicks and villians and heros, was so horribly cheesy that it sounds like a third graders dirty jokes. This movie was very obviously designed with one purpose in mind, to make money. Las Vegas was also, but at least Las Vegas has entertainment value, and the neon lights seen EVERYWHERE (freeze's costume, for example) in this movie. Dont waste your money here, get the originals with the Burton /Keaton team."
1,Holy Horsedung!,"Not only is this by far the worst of the four Batman films, it is possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Clooney was accused of ruining the franchise with his performance in this film, but the astounding awfulness of this picture has nothing to do with him. Writer Goldsman and director Schumacher have discovered a new low in filmmaking by demonstrating a genuine contempt for their audience. The jokes are insulting to the viewer, and the wretched ""everything is possible"" take on the action scenes reduce the danger to the heroes to nothing, and thereby destroy any sense of suspense or drama. A bunch of very talented actors are wasted in this schlockfest. If there never is another Batman film, it will be the fault of the overpaid hacks who wrote and directed this offensive mess."
1,Quite possiblly one of the worst films in the history.,"This is a movie that should have NEVER been made. The acting, directing, scripting, etc. were all F-grade (NOTE: I wouldn't even call this a B Grade movie). If you have a desire to seen a Batman movie. Go see Burton's Batman and Batman Returns. My advice to you is run as far as you can from this stink fest."
1,"Puaggg!!!, Schumacher doesn't know what Batman means","Batman is a dark guy, Gotham city is a dark city, batman will never go to a party, batman is smart, strong, like Sherlock Holmes. Bruce Waine, is not so funny. Please Tim Burton come back, and Keaton come back too, we need that kind of batman, not a funy guy running like a clawn in a nice city. Schumacher think that Batman is the tv series, I will say that he never read a Dark Knight Comic."
1,The caped crusader returns again /and again and again,"I wish they would've stopped this chain of films after Tim Burton left.Really people, the audiance can only take so much of a good thing.This travesty is directed by the sometimes brilliant Joel Schumacher ( 8mm and A Time To Kill for example ) and sometimes rediculous. ( Batman Forever and this one ) The script is such utter garbage it seems as if it was done by a fifth-grader. A FAILING fifth-grader. I am a huge fan of the Burton Batmans but this probably just nailed in the Dark Knight's coffin.Good ridance to such ridiculous rubbish."
2,Only thing that saves the film is Uma Thurman...,"This movie was a terrible letdown. A waste on uneeded lavish sets, terrible direction and worthless acting (except on Uma Thurman's part). George Clooney is terribly boring and stiff as Batman and Arnold Shwartz (ah forget it! I can't spell his name!) turns in a stupid macho role churning out cheesy lines like ""Chill, People!"" and ""Learn my name well, for it will be the chilling sound of your doom."" God. The only thing worth it in this movie is the funny, outlandish Uma Thurman as Poisin Ivy, but even then uses cheesy one liners and has ridiculous plant costumes. Gotham is terribly overdone and doesn't live up to any of the other Batman movies. Except Batman Forever, which was just as bad."
1,The worst film ever based on a comic book,"Batman and Robin was an overblown action film that was incredibly stupid. Easily one the worst film of 1997 and one of the worst of the decade, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman just couldn't put together a decent plot that's believable. The acting doesn't fair any better as we have a cheerful Bruce Wayne in George Clooney and a spouting one-liner Mr. Freeze."
1,i hate this movie with a firey passion,i strongly disliked this movie i disliked it and hated it for alot of reasons it is just this movie is terrible just terrible from begining to the very end from start to finish this movie is one big epic fail
1,"They should do an ""ET"" with this sorry movie.","This movie is a TOTAL DISGRACE to Batman's character and name!!! Bob Kane would have been rolling over in his grave,if he knew about this god-awful film! They should take EVERY single copy of this movie...dvds,vhs tapes,laser discs,and dump them all in a landfill somewhere,and bury them,like they did with the ET Atari game,years ago.That way,our future generation would not have to suffer from the pain that we suffered from,from this total disaster!"
1,Terrible movie,All I have to say is this was one of the biggest dissapointments and worst movies I've ever seen.
1,this movie is lame and boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this movie stinks its not even watchable its one of the worst movies ever made do not buy this lame movie buy star wars books instead like the new jedi order legacy of the force and fate of the jedi and the amazing thrawn trilogy and the hand of thrawn duology and the x wing series as well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I Dare You to Break My Record!,"I bought this on VHS from a thrift store, and the previous owner had stopped it at 25 minutes. I lasted a full 35 minutes before my popcorn ran out and there was no more reason to sit there watching this Truly Awful Thing. I bet you can't last any longer, unless someone ties you to a chair and pries your eyeballs open with toothpicks. Or maybe if you're drunk.How in heaven's name did they get so many big names to sign on? It must have involved either blackmail or a legally binding promise extracted by a dying man. I can't imagine that George or Arnold or Uma actually read the script and said ""Wow, this is really good!"""
1,Bat Credit Card,"If anyone saw the Nostalgia Critic's review of this movie, you know he considers it one of the WORST films of all time. And so do I, for various reasons. 1: I don't really like George Clooney (especially since I'm not too familiar with him), and he doesn't make a good Batman no matter how hard he tries. 2: There are too many cliches in this movie, like the sidekick wanting all the credit and Poison Ivy screaming ""Curses"" as she's getting eaten by her own plant. 3: While I never really liked Robin to begin with (really, who does), I hate the design of his suit. It's nothing like the original. At least Batman keeps the suit from before. And finally: A BAT CREDIT CARD, YOU IDIOTS! WHAT. WERE. YOU. THINKING?!?!?!?!"
1,Holy Bat Crap!,"I don't know what I hate the most: this whole absurdity excuse for a film or the fact that Batman and Robin ran around Gotham City with nipples in their suites. This is by far the worse film ever, and reason to be besides almost destroying the franchise it had a repulsive script that even made young ones upset.I cannot understand what was going through Joel Schumacher's mind when he was filming this debacle. There are so many things that you can point out from the film that you can even write a book about it and sell it under the joke section. I know he apologized years later for it but it still there's no reason to flip everything around from Tim Burton's first two dark knight movies to this junk. If it wasn't for Christopher Nolan the Bat would have probably never be seen again.I don't think I can watch this movie over even if they paid me to."
1,Worst Ever!!,"This is THE worst Batman movie ever in any medium. I don't hand out 1's haphazardly. Some movies are bad but at least have something positive. This is just utter trash. The only ones allowed to like this are women and little kids. Anyone else liking this has no excuse. Even Forever wasn't this bad and intolerable. If they wanted to make this fun for the kiddies, they could've at least stuck with the Forever formula or make it look something like what came later in The Batman cartoon. They totally disrespected the character here. Blah!"
1,At first a good movie but them...,"when i first saw it, whoa! what a great bat-movie, but them... this is the most boring movie, and Batman Forever is way much way much way much way better!!!"
1,BatBrain & Slobin,"This movie is so cliched you can see the lines & scenes coming a mile away. It also has alot of lame one-liners and over-the-top stunts. Mr.Freeze's ice puns are insufferable. The Moral is pointless as Peter Griffin's Cow-Kite. Like the live-action He-Man film,this movie also has homoerotic over-tones. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
1,Seriously??!!!,"Honestly, how did this one get into theaters? My GOD, Arnold Schwarzenegger is atrocious here, and the acting is pretty corny/cheesy/horrible throughout. It's overdone - it's like the actors knew what a bad job they were doing and parodied themselves.The latest editions of Batman (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight) do a lot to rectify this movie, bringing a seriousness and a validity to the story and the developments that this film utterly lacks. Thank everything for Christian Bale and our dearly-missed Heath Ledger!George Clooney must still be cringing over this one, and it's no wonder Ah-nold went into politics..."
1,Amazingly terrible,"This is probably one of the worst films ever made for any franchise.""alcar"" doesnt really have much taste in film making. Look at his comments on the fellowship of the ring book. Boromir dies in the two towers but they put in it the fellowship of the ring for a reason. Isnt very smart this guy is. This probably wont get posted but I hope he or she somehow sees this."
2,Not The Best Film Ever...,"...but not the worst film either.The only person I didn't mind watching was Uma Thurman who played her role really well.The rest of the cast are merely making up the numbers which considering the poor script is no surprise. It's a shame because Chris O'Donnell had possiblities as Robin when he starred with Val kilmer but him and Clooney just don't seem to have the same rapport.I say give it a go if you love anything Batman, if not then you're better off watching the first Batman film again!"
1,[*] ugly Batman film by Schumacher,Schumacher turns the Dark Knight into a cute Rainbow Knight trying to save gotham city from an even more cute villains.
1,TRAGEDY !,"Schumacher, why did you give us, Batman fans, this terrible demonstration of film-making? Why one of the most charismatic comic characters of all times had to be destroyed in this brainless history ? he (Batman) was at least ""surviving"" in the other three pictures, maintaining some credibility ( isay some because comic characters always loose their real charisma when going to the big screen(. Sad picture. It's not Clooney's fault. It's pure bad screenplay."
3,"A huge piece of sugary, gooey eye-candy","Though it's really pretty to look at, with all those dazzling special effects and color-drenched backdrops, I just can't seem to take it seriously, nor get any goosebumps at all. In comparsion to the serious, dark Batman of 1989, this film here makes a very dizzy but thrilling carnival ride and costume parade with a good deal of sexuality (both in males and females alike) and saucy friskness thrown in. The director probably attempted some serious sophistication in the vein of the old Tim Burton touch, but he didn't really come close in most places. And not all of the scenes are accurate to real life - for instance, telescopes are usually located in remote areas, not in the very middle of a huge, sprawling metropolis, nor do they need all those flashy images of animated planets constantly rolling across their surface. But again, it's still a fun ride and an very amusing fantasy for anyone who would care to indulge in."
1,the Power Rangers on acid,"This movie was just not good at all, and I normally make quite an effort to find redeeming qualities in even the most underrated movies. The dialogue in this one could have been from a Saturday morning cartoon, only not quite that intelligent. The acting was non-existent. The story wasn't there either. It had star power, to no avail. What happened to the fantastic first Batman with Keaton, and directed by Burton? Face it: Batman died at the box office."
1,Why Did They Bother Making This?,"Ever since Tim Burton and Michael Keaton left the ""Batman"" series, it's gone straight downhill. ""Batman Forever"" was lame, and this movie was embarassing. The new Batman movie with Christian Bale is good, however, but I would not recommend this one or ""Batman Forever"" at all."
1,An Insult to everything Batman(even Adam West's Batman),"This movie is so awful that it almost killed the Batman franchiseand comic book films altogther. Joel Schumacher really doesn't understand anything about Batman and it's rich histroy of characters and storylines.It's hard to say it but the 60's Tv show is more serious than this film and that's no joke.The Batmobile looks like a big Neon male sex organ(not kidding) Arnie as Dr. Freeze is a joke in itself, Uma Thurman wasn't that bad as Poison Ivy she was one of the film's stronger points. To sum it up this movie just makes fun of Batman, it is an insult to anyone who has liked anything of batman comic, film or Tv."
1,Schumacher kills Batman,"Batman is dead. This movie is so easy to make fun of. I agree with all of the 1 star reviewers. This movie was bad because of too many reasons to mention. If you love Batman, avoid this movie!"
1,Had to write a review in an attempt to lower the score.,This movie is only for the die hard masochistic eye candy wannabe batman fans
1,STALE POPCORN MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD,"Lets get the good in first....wait, there is not good. Batman is suppost to be dark and gothic. However, once Joel Schumacher took over the movie looks like a giant circus. Bright colors and less sinister villians make this movie too cartoonish. Plus adding Alicia Silverstone to the film, only makes your realize this is a hollywood movie, and stars want to be noticed as much as possible. It's not the actors fault, but Warner Brothers needs to get Michael Keaton back and get the films to a darker level like the comic books. I would give this film ZERO stars if I could."
1,An Insult to the Character,"If you're a Batman fan, you can't help but be insulted by this travesty directed by Joel Schumacher. Over-blown, over-done and over-acted, this film practically trashes all the elements that made this series popular. When this particular film series started there was a deliberate attempt to give fans a non-campy Batman after the old Adam West TV show. At least the 60's TV series was SUPPOSED to be over-the-top, but having a more ""serious"" approach to the character treated this way is inexcusable. Only George Clooney's underused Batman and Michael Gough's solid-as-always Alfred have any dignity to their roles. Everyone else overacts in one way or another. Schumacher's style was OK in BATMAN FOREVER, but he went overboard using a paint bucket rather than a brush in this travesty. (For those politically inclined, Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura has a cameo as an Arkham guard who gets poisoned by Uma Thurman's Poison Ivy.) A film to avoid, unless you want cheap laughs."
2,Batman & Robin Blu-ray review,Batman & Robin i didnt watch this movie since i was a kid.i used to like it when i was a kid but now nope.you can tell it's a bad movie when you are older now.i like how the movie looks but that's all i like about it the rest of it is just bad.the acting is bad and you dont care about batman & robin that's bad for a batman movie.it seems like they focuse on the villians more than the heros.i hate how posion ivy talks it's so anoying it kills the movie alot.the movie laste a little too long and the story isnt good and the actions seens are boring and slow this movie is a pass.
1,Average customer rating --- 2 stars...,"Yea, it is kinda bad. This movie is an insult to the batman series. Number one was the best. Number 2 rocked almost as much. Number 3 was pretty good although a step in a different direction. This movie is just plain crap.The cast is boring. The bad guys have resorted to cliches every other second. Robin is pretty good as he was in the last film. George Clooney blows as batman. He isn't cold or dark. He is probably the worst thing in the entire trilogy. Alicia Silverstone makes a fine Batgirl, but then again batgirl is rather useless. Arnold is the worst mostly because he says cliches that make him out to be an idiot. Don't even touch Ivy or Bane, they sucked.The plot has gotten pathetic slightly. I really could care less though with such a craptacular cast. Save your money and go buy the other films because this one isn't really worth it."
5,Painless Way to Learn Philosophy,"This series of books, popular culture and philosophy is fantastic. It seems that any popular movie, or TV series immediately generates a backlash. Two recent examples include the Harry Potter books and movies, and Me. Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. In the case of Harry Potter, fundamentalist Christians have lamented that the books are teaching witchcraft. In Passion, the movie is being charged as being anti-Semite.In this series of books, prominent philosophers are being asked to comment on these charges and on the story contained in the movie. In contrast to the shrill, loud, emotionally loaded comments being made primarily to get attention to the commenter, here are thoughtful, reasoned essays that challenge the reader to think about and decide for himself about these charges.These books make for absolutely delightful reading. It is a way to bring philosophy to the public in connection with a story that is familiar to a broad range of people."
3,Stay with earlier stuff,"This one is an album produced by Camilo in a specially difficult period of his career, but had interesting arrengments and compostions. His voice is not the same, but is Camilo"
5,"Fingerpickin' magic...smooth, rich, and delightful.","I discovered this cd when I popped it in the stereo of my car one snowy night ( it had been left behind by a friend of my brother). The owner never saw it again.This has become my favorite music to brew beer by. A cd full of fingerpicking delights, it features guests like Doc Watson. Starting with the toe tapping ""Steel Guitar Rag"", Hull & Co. progress through classics like ""St. Anne's Reel"", and ""Blackberry Blossom"" to finish with ""New Camptown Races"". If you are a fan of fine ragtime guitar, this is going to become a very well-loved addition to your collection."
2,A collection of random chapters,"Do not believe this book's title. The best title should be ""Something about heat transfer calculations."" Do not believe that Mr. Myer Kutz is the author of this book: he is just a compiler. A professional compiler. This is bad practice of some publisher to misguide readers by placing the compiler's name on the book's cover as the book's author. All the chapters are written by the experts in the appropriate areas, but selection of subjects is quite random. If you are one of this book's authors, buy this book, put it on a shelf, and be proud. Individual chapters can be interesting to the specialists, but the book as a whole is intended for large university libraries only."
2,Doesn't hold a candle to Grosse Pointe Blank,"This movie is an unofficial sequel to Grosse Pointe Blank, which is a true American classic. With a lot of the same actors and writers, War Inc. tries to be Grosse Pointe Blanke but with a quasi-political slant on today's events in the Middle East. It drives home some great points and decent comedy on certain events if you know about these things. For the average viewer a lot of the comedy will be lost because they don't follow NPR, or watch anything but Fox news.The movie as a whole fails completely, in cinematography, direction, and overall story. John Cusack's charm isn't enough to save it. You rent it and you'll see that if you're a really big fan of GPB, this comes off as like a spoof on GPB, instead of an unofficial sequel. It's an extremely odd feeling, after watching the same actors who graced us with GPB, to end up with a lame duck of a movie.I know that GPB's magic will never be recreated. And this movie is proof of that statement."
1,Grosse Blank,"I actually loved ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" even turning my very liberal son onto it, which DVD he then bought. This movie is a pretty ""grosse"" attempt at a sequel. I have a feeling that the question they asked when they casted this flick was, ""who would most like to disrespect America and our troops in Iraq?"" Where I was rolling in the aisles for the original, I found myself struggling to achieve a smirk in this attempt at humor. If you are one of the foaming-at-the-mouth haters of the last administration, you probably rated this 4-stars. As for this clear-thinking patriot, I thought it sucked!"
2,"so, so","I am a fan of John Cusack's work, but this was not my favorite movie. It was boring, rather disjointed...silly...I suppose if you like ""Airplane"" you might like this. View at your own risk."
2,Good idea + bad script = Bad movie.,"John Cusack plays a sort of mercenary for Tamerlane, a company headed by the ex-Vice President of the US. Tamerlane is establishing itself i Turaqistan, after the US has invaded and ""freed"" the country. Cusack is hired to take out a man named Omar Sharif, who plans to build a pipeline through the country, thus destroying Tamerlane's plans to do so.The movie starts out as a clever satire of how American companies, often with ties to the government, profit from the war on terror. I wanted to like the movie and after the first ten minutes or so I thought I would. But it doesn't take long before the story completely loses its focus. It seems to be heading in all sorts of direction but doesn't go anywhere, all the while taking itself too seriously, forgetting to be funny. After an hour or so I had lost all my interest and was waiting for the movie to end.War, Inc. was a good idea wasted on a bad script. I wanted to like it but I didn't. Not recommended."
1,Worst Cusack movie ever,"You get the point 5 minutes in. Zero funny, 100% boring. A very painful movie."
1,"Not Funny and Not ""Smart""","Ok, just because this movie bashes the Bush administation doesn't make this a ""smart"" movie.This is a ""bad"" movie.it reminded me of a mix between the awful ""Southland Tales"" and the horrible ""Home of the Brave"" - except worse, because I had to shut this off not even half way through."
1,Bad,"One of the worst cluster ****s of a movie ever produced. This piece of crap is nothing kore than leftist venom directed at the right. It is desperate and poor crafted. The leads are all awful. The message clubs you over the head repeatedly making it's political point. The story is so absurd and clownish, it is insulting. It's just awful. If you can even watch the whole thing without becoming hostile, more power to you. You are more forgiving or dumb."
1,Not what I expected,"I saw the good reviews of this movie online, so I rented it. I figured John Cusack would be really good. However, the movie proved to be very crude and ridiculous. The satire was so strong and outrageous that it wasn't very good at all. It wasn't entertaining either. It was not funny, the jokes were just awful and most of the time not understandable, and I had to turn it off after twenty minutes. I regret spending my money on this movie."
1,"War, Inc",John Cusack - Great Actor - bad materialHilary Duff - Potential there - total wasteMarisa Tomei - Great Actress - bad materialJoan Cusack - Great Actress - bad materialDan Aykroyd - Great Actor - bad materialwas hoping it was a spin on Gross Pointe Blank. Not in the same playing field at all.sad. Fantastic Talent wasted
1,"I love John Cusack, but this is definitely NOT his best work!","I rented this movie figuring how could it really be a bad movie if it has such a great cast. Well, now I know! Yes, the idea of the movie is a good one, but the in-your-face crudeness, and over-the-top satire really just ruins the movie. Yes, he is a hitman, but the character doesn't work. Grosse Point Blank was great, even with his sister Joan playing a similar character, this is just a bad movie. John Cusack wrote this (or produced it) and he should stick to his straight man off the cuff roles he plays so well (way back, ""Better off Dead"", ""Midnight in the Garden of Good & Evil"", ""Grosse Pointe Blank""). Save your time & money. This is just a really bad movie with questionable performances by everyone."
3,"My review of War, Inc. (Blu-ray)","The picture and sound quality are good. The movie itself is decent. It's your typical Hollywood liberal propaganda, so it's obviously biased and not quite accurate."
3,"Political art is ""meh"" art","Very political, a little funny, visually OK. Meh.A completely privatized war, with the strings pulled by the CIA and managed by a remorseful operator.Not even the talents of Hilary Duff, Ben Kingsley, and Marisa Tomei (generally very good) could save this from mediocrity. To be fair, Ms Duff dealt with a subtle and complex role very well. She was cast as a pop starlette from Central Asia, who was looking for a way out of an awful third world country, with a few extra secrets. Ms Tomei played an idealistic journalist who falls for the operator and still wants to unveil corporate and political corruption. Kingsley does well as the puppet master, managing the fall and rise of kingdoms and pulling our hero's strings.It was OK; rent, don't buy.E.M. Van Court"
3,Barely three stars,"I have to agree with the average of review stars. This movie wasn't that good. The story was supposed to be a sendup of CIA-type flicks, but it fell a bit flat, and didn't ever get the laughs it seemed to be going for. The black humor was more of a gray color... Joan Cusack, I could have done without, in her shrill, typecast role. I like Marisa Tomei, but she was not well directed as the ""normal"" one. You could be excused for confusing Ben Kingsley with Patrick Stewart in X-Men... This movie couldn't make up its mind to be one thing or the other, either a campy but semi-serious spy flick or a total crazy sendup, and it floundered for that reason. If you want a good movie of this type, try Wag the Dog, or Dr. Strangelove, or even Primary Colors (tho that does not include war, just politics). Or any of Pierce Brosnan's Bond flicks. Or even Sneakers. They're all better than this."
3,"Good, not great.","This was good, but not great. I think I need to watch it a second time, actually. I did find the actors to be absolutely wonderful. I adore John Cusack and usually not so much Joan, but her style of acting fit this part absolutely perfectly.I got a bit lost in the storyline, somehow missed the significance of the hot sauce (and am now obsessed with it actually)... but it's worth a watch - but pay attention to this one, I was a bit distracted. Will give it another watch when I can pay attention closer!"
1,Need the capability to give zero stars,"I had high hopes for this movie given the star power in it. John Cusack is one of my favorite actors, and his sister Joan is usually hilarious. Marisa Tomei is a comedic and dramatic genius, and of course Ben Kingsley is an acting ace. Dan Aykroyd is another favorite actor--loved him in Spies Like Us. In this movie, though, they all fall far short of their true potential. The plot is hard to follow, the characters are either muddied and incomprehensible or nothing more than cardboard caricatures. It was hopeless drivel, and after watching it for far more than I really wanted to, I finally just popped the DVD out and gave up. I would not recommend this movie to anyone but someone with nothing else to do and no prospects of ever having a good time anywhere else. On a scale from 1 to 5, it's a definite 0. Even watching John Cusack didn't make up for the lack of a credible plot."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I mostly like John Cusack's movies but this one was the worst. Not funny, even though it had been pushed so hard with a senseless and childish black comedy humor. For me a total loser of the year.Oguz Senol"
4,A good political satire,"In Turaquistan, an American company is occupying the country after it's defeat. The company's president has sent his hitman, Hauser, to assassinate a Middle Eastern oil minister. Hauser is now struggling with his dark past. He must pose as the corporation's trade show producer to pull off the hit. Now he must entertain a pop star before her wedding, and keep a left-wing reporter off his back. All these things may be more than he can handle while keeping his sanity.This movie is really funny. It stars John Cusack, who is one of my favorite comedic actors. The story is interesting, the characters are compelling, and everything is completely off the wall, yet almost believable. I'm really glad I saw this film, and I recommend it to anyone who need a good laugh."
3,Spiritual Sequel to Grosse Point Blank Does Not Disappoint,"This sharp and witty political satire may be remembered as Hilary Duff's finest hour a decade from now, but most viewers will be occupied and intrigued by John Cusak's return to material that was so brilliantly spun in Grosse Point Blank. Though lacking the subtlety of the earlier film this movie has its moments and what priceless moments they are. Don't let anyone spoil this one for you and watch it with as open a mind as possible. Enjoy!"
1,Action is continuous but I was bored throughout,"This 2008 film is a try at political satire that fails miserably. The premise is that an American Corporation runs the world. John Cusack is cast in the role of an assassin who follows the orders of his boss, an American ex-vice president played by Dan Aykroyd. After an opening scene which shows Cusack murdering three men in an Alaska bar, he is sent on his next mission, which is to assassinate a Middle Eastern oil minister. The country is a stereotype and there is never a dull moment because there are explosions everywhere. Hillary Duff is cast as a local superstar, Marisa Tomei is cast as an American reporter fighting for justice, and Ben Kingsley is one of the bad guys. Action is continuous but I just didn't care. And in spite of good performances by the cast I was bored throughout. Frankly I hated the film. It gets absolutely no recommendation from me whatsoever."
4,"A good Cusack movie, worth seeing","""War, Inc."" is a good, solid John Cusack movie, but that's about it. It's not as funny or as political as I had hoped. Most of the funniest bits are in the trailer. The storyline is predictable but the writing is good.The performances are fine, and Marisa Tomei is irresistible on every level. Hillary Duff's character has a scene with a scorpion that, like Princess Leia's slave outfit in ""Return of the Jedi,"" will haunt any hetero male's imagination for a long time.Worth seeing."
4,"Name names, no games",If I say what I think Amazon won't publish it?These times summed up without naming names.Obscene profits on death by American corporationswith political ties to well known public officials.I actually don't think it is all that funnyor I'd give it five stars.
5,Support Our Troops,"I like the Cusacks, and Marisa Tomei is always a joy to watch. The story is interesting and well paced. The backdrop of aggressive war as a corporate profit center puts the characters and their actions in perspective. Great entertainment and a good way to understand some of what our troops are actually doing ""in harm's way."""
2,"Couple laughs, but mostly misses the mark","Had some amusing moments, but overall this satire misses the mark. For every memorable scene (such as the artificial-leg line dance and the ""virtual embedding"") there are five more that fall flat. Marisa Tomei looks as great as she always does but is asked to do little; and John Cusack reprises his Grosse Point Blank character, but with far lesser effect. The only surprise was Hilary Duff, who I only know as being a Disney singer - couldn't name a single song - but did a half-decent job as the local wanna-be diva. I really wanted to like this, but just can't really recommend it very highly."
3,Great potential wasted,"Being a followup to the excellent Grosse Pointe Blank, I had high hopes for this, but was let down by it over and over again. The nut of the problem was that it kept falling back to overtly political attempts at comedy. Some of it worked, but mostly when this movie ventured into the period political it was both unfunny and unpersuasive.Three stars because there is 60% of a good movie here. The performances were decent, the parts that focus on character development are solid, and production values were pretty good (some below par set/effects work).Ultimately, though, yet another potentially great movie ruined by the Bush era and the repeated, failed and painful (to watch) efforts of Hollywood make a movie that is both good art/entertainment and really, really against Bush and his administration."
2,Disappointing Sequel,"I hadn't heard of War Inc. When it was at the movies or when it was released on DVD, so when I saw it in a video store last week I was surprised. I picked it up because I saw John Cusack on the cover. Then I started to read the synopses, and saw that it is a sequel toGrosse Pointe Blank, which I loved. Seeing the all star cast, I thought I had found a treasure.Sadly, the story has a few of the characters from Grosse Pointe Blank, but lacked the wit and humor of that great dark comedy. The film tries too hard to work the ""Evil American Corporation"" thing. And while there are some funny parts and some excellent violent action scenes, War Inc, fails to live up to it's predecessor.2 *"
5,This movie was great!,"I thought this was very canny, dead-on satire of corporate policies in the Middle East. Cusak did a great job. His nuanced performance expressed a lot of backhanded humor. All the caricatures were dead-on, and Hillary Duff's character was hysterical. The story had moral and philosophical depth. Surrealist Mark Leyner's influence can be seen throughout the film (he wrote the screenplay, along with Cusak and Jeremy Pisker), yet still it is not very much more surreal than what I know to be happening in Baghdad currently. Very symbolic, very relevant to current affairs, an absolute must-see."
3,"Alright movie, bit patchy at times, some good laughs","This is the story of a hitman hired by a large arms company to kill a political leader of a small country that the company has major interest in financially. Basically, the small country is owned by the company and the Leader is possibly blocking the full potential. John Cusack plays the hitman, with (no surprise) his sister Joan being his coordinator. Dan Akroyd has a small part in this as well as a Retired Vice President of The US. Overall, interesting premise, good mix of satire, but overall choppy, and tought to track at times. I found myself easily loosing interest and having to re-watch a part to get myself back up to speed. This is available to rent at most movie places, or to watch here on amazon. As for investing in it, save the cash until you see it."
4,Very well done,"Interesting take on many of the controversies of the past. Good use of science, as opposed to heated opinion, to come up with some answers to ""did they or didn't they""? I liked the author's historical approach, using cases to trace the development of forensics over time. Overall, a very good read."
5,the celtic vision,"wonderful book but it should be read after reading De Waal's, The Celtic Way of Prayer. I view ""vision"" as a companion piece to the other book."
1,Defective Product,"After getting two of the same receivers from J/R Music through Amazon, both had the same defective headset jack. The first was an obvious return repackaged; the second was new. I called Onkyo tech support who assured me they'd test it out and get back to me. They never did. After 5 weeks trying to get the product and the absolute lack of support from the manufacturer I would never buy Onkyo again."
4,Reference for the Neurologist,"In allopathic medicine there has been an increasing interest in integrative and alternative medical practices driven in large part by the interest of our patients. In short, the patients want it. It can be easy to quickly dismiss their enthusiasm for naturopathic approaches but a wise physician might look for a way to incorporate alternative medicine in their practice. This volume provides a basis to do so. It thoroughly reviews a broad spectrum of approaches not found in traditional medical training, and provides an honest and evidence-based evaluation of each. It will help, particularly the neurologist, to discern when to incorporate herbalism, accupuncture or chiropracty into your standard of care and when to caution patients who maybe considering such practices in lieu of appropriate medical care. It will also provide a framework for understanding approaches patients are already seeking and encourages awareness of this trend in patient preferences."
5,Truman a Hit with the Grandkids!,"This is a beautifully illustrated picturebook. The water colored pictures are so vivid that Truman seems to come alive. He is a huge mischievious dog that makes you laugh and steals your heart. As the words are few, we have fun using our imaginations in adding to his antics. We love him no matter what trouble he gets himself into. Therein lies the lesson for the little ones. Their faces light up everytime we pull Truman out, and that is quite often!"
2,Disappointing,"I gave it only two stars because I was disappointed in the amount of chocolate included in this basket. The packaging and presentation were very nice, but the contents left my wife looking for more. The candy was fresh and tasted good, but the portions were very small. The box and packaging weigh five pounds, but I would estimate there were only about 14 ounces or less of candy. For $39.99 plus $9.99 shipping, you could do much better shopping at your local HEB or Rite Aid. Next time I will buy her a two pound Whitman's Sampler as they know how to pack a box with chocolates."
2,Chocolate lover,Ordered to put treats in stockings. Disappointed to find that in each box the treats were only half the size of the box. I guess they wanted individuals to think they were getting more than they actually are. Will not purchase this product again.
3,Decent Presentation for the Money,"I've bought a few different types of gift baskets on Amazon. This particular gift basked is the first one that I've received (under $40) that I could give away without feeling like a cheapskate. It has a good size and presentation. If you're looking for a gift basket that doesn't clearly show you intended to get off spending very little money, I'd start with this one."
5,Page Turner,"Locals will enjoy this book because of the familiar landmarks and the enduring ranch lifestyle. Others will find the historic detail couched in thrilling fiction to be both informative and gripping. Hats off to Mr. Little for sharing the geography, lifestyle and history of Eastern Montana and Western North Dakota."
3,From the mans perspective.,"I am a man that tried to put this book to work, but it is written in the form that the cheating spouse wants to return, and is a man who will lose their kids if they chose to leave or stay and still gets a divorce.I have my kids strictly because my wife cheated...3 times...and allowing her back in the home to have the face time destroys the chance of me keeping the kids. My wife has shown no sense that she really wants to work on the marriage, but seems to want to get the kids.I will have no problem with following what the book suggests to get the trust back, but not until she is dedicated to coming back to the marriage. And I am affraid I can't totally trust her motivations to return till the divorce goes through.I will say that the book does give some good advice, but it needs to have a spouse ready to come back before any of the advice can be applied."
1,Tough love causes more pain,"I read this book when I was in panic mode. I took all of his advice, and now today I am sorry. Getting angry only made me more bitter and resentful toward my spouse. Telling all my friends and family, and his friends and family burned so many bridges that are going to take more time to rebuild. I am sorry I followed Dr. Clarke's advice. Any counselor that claims to have all the answers and do not teach to go to God for the answers first, is misleading. There is another way to heal your marriage. Check out the ministries online, called Covenant Keepers and Rejoice Marriage Ministries. We are called to follow Christ, not manipulate our spouses into programs.""Love covers over a multitude of sins."""
1,Questionable Theory,"I think the action plans in this book could easily back-fire, leaving the spouse who wants reconciliation in more trouble than before. I would advise those who read this book to carefully consider how the book fits with what the bible says concerning marriage."
5,Mary Lou Parks,"Duets of motion is a clever collection of short stories and poems that explores the hopes and fears in our innermost psyche. The author uses many senerios to help us reach into the dark as well as the bright parts of our soul. Mr. Heffernan takes us to forboding places where we often don't want to go, but then he brings us back into the symphony with his verses of ""Small Cars,"" ""Summer Dreams"" and ""Planting Trees."" Even the busiest person in today's high tech world will find this book a fast and facinating reading experience. You'll enjoy every minute of it!"
2,forget it,"i ordered this television twice around christmas. it's beautiful but both times it arrived broken. it was shipped by UPS and they obviously threw it around - so much so that the styrofoam was busted, the tv plastic casing was broken and there were parts of the interior floating around - twice! samsung needs to package it better because the UPS punks just don't care. Samsung did easily refund the money though."
1,"Another Camelot Movie, another reason not to make them...","While a big fan of the Arthurian legends I failed to enjoy this movie at all. Helena Bonham-Carter, as per normal, was fantastic, but I don't know where Isabella Rossellini learned to act. I began to wonder what at all Merlin would see in her. The main character (Merlin) ran around saying the rather poor lines in a New Zealand accent while silly Martin Short stuck to his American one. Maybe with a different Merlin this movie would have worked. Arthurian movies should estrict themselves to Merlin-like concepts, where we know it is a complete farce, but are enjoying it too much to care."
4,"Maybe not authentic, but quite entertaining...","I was perplexed when I read some of the extremely negative reviews.Though the movie definitely takes some liberties with the original Arthuriantales, I found it to be well acted and very entertaining. I thought the special effects were better than any fantasy type movie I've ever seen."
1,Not even close to Excalibur,"This movie is typical of how an American film company takes mythology from other countries and trashes it so bad that the unsuspecting American viewer thinks it's great fun, and that what they're getting is also an education on other cultures. ""Merlin"" is a travesty to Arthurian legends, which comes as no surprise to me with the US film industry these days- compensating good storylines and acting for the sake of turning out no-brainer SFX marvels. If I wanted to see great special effects, I could easily accomplish the same on my pentium. If you want to witness a great movie on Arthur, then go see John Boorman's Excalibur. Unlike Merlin, Excalibur is another US (Warner) production which is exemplary of what Hollywood used to be capable of, and could be again someday."
4,Great Movie!,This movie was great! Wonderful special effects. Its truely one of the best made-for-TV movies that I have ever seen!
1,Don't waste your money!,"I hesitate to give Merlin even one star...I thought it was pure drivel. I wanted to like it and truly tried to keep an open mind about what I was watching. Instead I found it to be alternately laughable and embarrassing in its depiction of Arthurian legend, as well as in its obvious bias against all things pagan. The plot was bizarre and disjointed and the characters were shallow and narrow minded. I kept waiting for Sam Neill to either chop off Morgan's finger or run screaming from a velociraptor. In fact, I think that death by velocipraptor would be preferable to being forced to sit through this utterly worthless and entirely obnoxious film ever again."
1,"Call it what you want, but this ain't Camelot!","This video ambigously portrays Merlin as cold on one hand, and compassionate on the other. He was neither. Often the mysterious recluse, he was motivated only by his own interests. Absent are the brute savagery and violent blood-letting commonplace during Merlin's time(5th century). The cost of historical and literary integrity results in a slick, commercialized rendition pandering to a more family-oriented audience. Many of the familiar mythologies are either stripped down or missing- The Knights of the Round Table, origins of Excalibur in detail, the purpose of the Quest for the Holy Grail, King Arthur, etc.,. What we end up with are snoozy speciel effects, corny dialog, and a `happily-ever-after' ending which the 3 to 10 year-old age group will find very apealing. If you're a true lover of Arthurian mythology you'll most likely look elsewhere for chivalrous inspiration because you won't find it here."
5,"Great movie, one of my favorites!","I loved this movie, and it's one I come back to and watch over and over again! It's not the first story about Merlin, but it's a great one! So much better then 'First Knight'. If you're pagan you'll appreciate Queen Mab! And if you love good acting, good special effects, good storyline, and good endings you'll love this movie! I'm really surprised this movie hasn't been more promoted! It's probably because ignorant people don't understand the Old Ways and this movie is a turn off for those stingy few who don't believe in magic..."
3,good,This movie had its good points and its boring points. This is a good film dont get me wrong it is grate for young and older kids. It is a interesting story line and the carictors are grate too it is just that some points just dont quite chetch your attention.
3,The Only Thing I Liked,"Must be The Lady of the Lake... she was indeed the most artistic feature in this movie. Her necklace, her appearence, her voice... oh, she was so incredibly well made and acted.But the rest was more or less childish. Something meant for children."
2,The home video version was CHOPPED!,"The original movie was great. I would easily give it 5 stars. However, Hallmark saw fit to cut the movie down to a horrid rag before slapping it on to video tape. A grave wrong doing! In its full glory this movie is spectacular, breathtaking, and simply wonderful. I suggest you find someone who recorded it off of the television and make a copy of the original. Do not bother with this watered down confusing cut."
3,"A comment on the Special Edition ""5.1 Circle Surround"" ...","Don't buy the Special Edition for the Dolby Digital 5.1 with the expectation that it will sound superior to the 2.0 presented on the first DVD release. The Dolby Digital 2.0 actually sounds far superior to what they term on this disc's audio menu option as 5.1 ""Circle Surround"". The 5.1 upper bass is exaggerated and muddy throughout, to the point of distraction. Faint detail sounds, such as the chirping of birds in the background, are clearer and more detailed in the 2.0 presentation as well. The 2.0 audio is recorded at a somewhat lower level than normal, but raising the volume control solves that. This is one of those rare instances where the original 2-channel recording offers a superior audio experience. The Special Edition offers both audio options, so if you want to buy the SE for the special features and audio commentary, just remember when you watch the movie to select the 2.0 audio option."
3,Movie should be called Queen Mab!,"Some things about the movie are OK like Queen Mab and Flic. But the movie portrays Merlin as a weak wizard and King Arthur as a weak king. Arthur never seems like a great king in control of his kingdom and Merlin never seems to have helped Arthur let alone himself. Half the time it seemed like Merlin had no power. Overall the plot development from the Merlin side was poor. On the Queen Mab side it was great. She seemed like the central character in the movie. The movie is OK to watch once. If you want to see a good movie, see Excalibur. I've seen it at least 15 times and love it as much as the first."
1,An insult to King Arthur's mythology,"If you enjoyed this movie it's because you never heard of King Arthur's story before. Or because you hated it and want to make fun of it. It's even worse than 'First Knight' in some ways! Everything in this version was wrong: concept, story, script, dialogue, characters, acting, cast (miscasted some actors, wasted others), effects, unfunny jokes, anachronisms, talking horses... Stay away from this piece of crap. Or, better, buy all the copies you can find and burn them. All thinking persons in the world will be grateful. And if you want to see a true great movie about Arthurian legends, check John Boorman's 'Excalibur', and enjoy a masterpiece. If I were somewhat involved in the making of this 'Merlin', I would be really ashamed of myself."
1,A big disappointment,"I am a great fan of King Arthur & Merlin and eagerly looked forward to this movie. What a disapointment. This movie had no story, no character developement, and meaningless special effects. What a waste of talented actors."
4,A different view of Merlin,"I really enjoyed this mini-series despite it's handling of Morgan La Fey as a deformed idiot with a speech impediment. It was a little campy, but in a good way and I thought Sam Neil was a wonderful choice for Merlin. All in all they did an decent job with the smaller small screen budget and seeing people like Rutger Hauer (long among my favorite actors) in it was a bonus."
2,Good effects but some overacting,"This is a movie that has beautiful sets, costumes, and a cast of excellent and well respected actors. However, as one who has always enjoyed the King Arthur/Merlin stories, this is not the typical King Arthur story. I am not sure if kids will like this story because it has some very scary scenes. Miranda Richardson's character is interesting and irritating, the actor effectuates this very weird and almost whinny voice in playing her character as an Evil fairy queen or something. Sam Neill and Isabella Rosilini are good. However, Helena Bonham Carter was terrible and there is a lot of overacting (or maybe just bad acting). The ending is also a let down. But overall, its entertaining to an extent, but I am not in a hurry to view this DVD again."
3,"The special effects were cool for 1997 or 1998, whenever it came out.","Aside from the special effects, the movie was just kind of blah. It was nice to see Rutger Hauer in action again, but even this star from the fabled Flesh and Blood film couldn't make it interesting. Just stop making Arthur films already."
5,This is the best movie about Merlin/Camelot EVER,"This movie has an EXCELLENT cast, superb writing, amazing computer graphics, and such a great spin on the Camelot legends. I loved ever second of it! If you haven't seen it yet or just if you love stories about the days of Excalibur, please check this selection out! It's enchanting, entertaining, romantic, exciting, and endearing!"
1,How to turn King Arthur into an uninteresting movie,"This is a painfully bad retelling of the Arthurian Legend. The bad guys look more like the bad guys out of Welcome Back Kotter, The good guys look like a high school production of Camelot. Camelot itself looks like part of a cheap 1970s TV show set.The story centers around Sam Neill as an unappealing Merlin, Martin Short as Merlin's sidekick stooge Frik and HB Carter(Morgan la Fey) who, despite being the high point of the film, is completely unable to convince us that she has any affection for the bumbling Frik.Bad guys grimace, music sweeps heroically, rousing speaches and predictability ensue, followed by a forgettable conclusion.Not worth it even for fans of the genre."
1,A Lousy Arthur,"Recently when at the video store I got ""Merlin"" mixed up in my head with with a BBC production of the same name, mistaking the former for the latter. When I got home and realized my error I figured, 'Go ahead and watch it, how bad can it be?' Heck, it has Sam Neill, Martin Short, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Rutger Hauer in it!The answer is that it can be pretty damn bad and a complete waste of time. So much so, that it's difficult to find anything good to say about the movie. Casting: Sam Neill as a believable Merlin? Maybe if the film were made in 1975 and not 1995. Acting: it's as stiff as can be imagined. The actor's have to be treating ""Merlin"" as just a paycheck. Direction, cinematography, score? Forget 'em, they're no improvement over the casting and acting.Don't make my mistake; this one is a loser."
1,It could've been better,"Merlin could've been a better movie. I could point out all of its faults from beginning to end, but that would be wasting my time. There's enough here to add a commentary audio track on the subject alone. Unlike many bad fantasy films that are awful from the get go(DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS to name one), Merlin could've been one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. That's what really burns me up inside. The pieces to the puzzle were definitely there, but never quite fitted together. To make matters worse, Kathryn Bigelow(the talented director of POINT BREAK, and the horror classic NEAR DARK) was originally slated to direct Merlin. But negotiations fell through, and they had to settle for Steve Barron(who?!?!?). For NBC, the rest is ""kick yourselves in the head"" history. For viewers, another waste of time."
1,Abosolutely the worst Arthurian film of all time.,"Merlin is the worst Arthurian movie, I think, of all time. It contains boring scenes, wasted acting talent (meaning the greatest actors money can buy on a script worth less than a bottle of water), and unbelivable romances. Young kids who don't read books may enjoy _Merlin_, but this film is way too overrated for all the hype it got prior to its initial airing on NBC. I must admit that the special effects were great, but a movie can't ride on effects alone.... especially when it's almost 4 hours long. I thought it would never end. Even _Excalibur_, which I consider to be far superior than _Merlin_, was a bit too long for me at nearly 2 1/2 hours."
5,Excellent movie that just takes you off to the middle age!,"I must say that I had my doubt when I saw the cover at the store..Why? Because this kind of movies kind of have a tendensy of letting you down in some way. This movie was far more than I had hoped for and the clothing , and acting spesially from Martin Short and Miranda Richardson was brilliant, not that the other actors wasn't good either...Just my type of adventure movie..Superb..and this from Hallmark?!?!...Great!"
1,Slop-Fest '98,"Very sloppy, indeed. This show could've done without half of the sequences filmed. At 1 1/2 hours I would've given 2 stars for a much better film. Now I have no choice but to grade it 1 star. English-speaking horses + toe tapping broadway numbers in a castle hall is not my idea of a medieval fantasy. It's bad enough with Camelot and Kid in King Arthur's Court that we don't need anymore new additions to the ever-growing list of cheesy fantasy flicks. Bypass this one if you can. Movies with the best portrayals of Merlin that I can recommend off the top of my head are 1) Excalibur, 2) Merlin of the Crystal Cave, and 3) Any of the numerous documentaries on Merlin available."
5,Far better than I expected,"I'm shocked to say I found this 3 hour TV mini-series moreentertaining, more human, and more emotional, than almost all the hugesword and sorcery epic features of late (Lord of the Rings, The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe, etc.).By staying closely to the legend of Merlin and King Arthur, and puttingcharacter first and effects and battles scenes 2nd (though there areplenty of both) I felt I understood the story of King Arthur for thefirst time.I was very caught up and rarely bored, and even quite moved by afairy-tale which has a happy ending tinged with bitterness and loss.The cast is generally first rate with Sam Neil, Martin Short andMiranda Richardson all doing excellent work.This felt true to the spirit of stories that are not just about goodpeople winning, but also about loss, grief and moral compromise."
4,Wonderful TV movie,"This is a TV-made movie, to tell the story of Merlin.Sam Neil did a wonderful job in this movie to tell the story of Camelot, from Merlin's side. The raise and fall of magic.It's something worth owning, review it later days and never get tired of it."
1,WAIT FOR THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!,"This one is a mind boggler. Many of the scenes were vague and saturated with SFX sequences. I don't even understand why they had to include King Arthur. All he ever does is complain to Merlin about his illness and other problems. Both him and Frik were quite annoying. They accomplished nothing other than to waste valuable time and space which could've been used to help fill in the many holes in the plot. Don't waste your money on this soon to be obsolete DVD! WAIT FOR THE DIRECTOR'S CUT, INSTEAD! It should be available sometime early next year and will differ significantly from the current version. Roughly 30 minutes will be replace by 27 minutes of never-before-seen footage to help make the film more comprehensible. Merlin will finally get the treatment it deserves and become a perennial contender to Excalibur. Until then, it's just another ""Kid in King Arthur's Court""."
1,What a wasted cast,"Ridiculous special effects that remind one of a Saturday morning kids' show riddle the entire film. If you're looking for a great ""Arthurian"" movie... this isn't it. Try Boorman's ""Excalibur"", instead. How in the world such a group of talented actors could be so wasted is a shame. Worth watching . . . if only to see how fine actors don't necessarily equal a fine film. Martin Short holds his own but Sam Neil, Helena Bonham Carter, Miranda Richardson and Rutger Hauer all drown in poor production and dialogue. Isabella Rosellini should have called in sick for this one."
2,Merlin was a major disappointment,"I strongly advise anybody considering the purchase of the video release for Merlin to reconsider. I don't know if the mini-series broadcast on TV was better, but the video was really bad--probably because it was a condensed version. Though special effects were good, the dialogue was impoverished and the plot was a clunker. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was Martin Short's portrayal of Frick."
4,Another view of the Arthur Legend,"Merlin is a movie, originally made for TV, that presents a different view of the legend of King Arthur. The cast is excellent, the concept well thought out, and the historic details quite correct. The story line has a unique approach to a well worn subject. Like the real legend, this has mature content handled in an appropriate manner. It is not a children's film. Done on a modest production budget, it lacks the very sophisticated computer generated effects that would elevate this to a theater quality release. If you are a fantasy fan and enjoy knights in armor, dragons, and sorcerers, this is a film for you."
1,"Like the SCUD, this one mis-fired!","Merlin misses its mark like a deaf bat hungover on a Sunday morning! It is so far off the beaten path that the title seems unjustified. The sets and costumes were from the wrong time period. The acting and script just awful. This movie reeks. There's no other way to put it. What were they thinking? Any chance it might've had of redeeming itself disappeared once Frick walked onto the set. The time of Merlin was poignantly one of sadness, tragedy, wonder, and grace. For a Martin Short or Jim Carrey to partake in such serious literary work of importance as this is a recipe for disaster. Unless Merlin was intended to be a parody, National Lampoon humor has no place in a film like this. My dog even threw up while we were watching! It may have all been a coincidence, but I have my suspicions..."
5,More Than Mortal,"If your a person of good values and of Celtic heritage this is the movie for you. I was sitting down last night with my bottle of Jameson and a bag of potatoe chips and I have to tell you that this movie told me alot of why we cannot and should not return to the old ways. Being of Irish and English descent this movie showed me alot of what it was like and where to go from there. I would recommend it to anyone who dreams about what I do. As far as a movie goes I thought it was quite well done. After watching Excalibur, The Druids, The Celts, and a few others, I would have to say that no movie with the exception of Braveheart does The Celts any justice."
3,Charming take on the Arthurian Legend,"Bottom line: a nice telling of an old story from a less common angle.While the FXs are not earth shattering and the acting and dialogue are not gripping, these elements *do* play quite well in the context of Merlin telling the story of his life. The quirky FXs and the plot pace give it a dreamy quality appropriate to an old man looking back on his life.Some of the magic scenes (like the candle flames floating away) or the panoramic scenes, like the tidal flat, are memorable. The setting and costumes are much less anachronistic than most tellings of this story.It's a good lazy Sunday afternoon watch. And considering the general lack of fantasy DVD titles, a good addition to a fantasy fan's library."
1,"VERY, VERY DULL.","This film has been described as a `Family Movie' but I can't think of one reason why any kids would want to watch this 3 1/2+ hour dud. Nothing kept my interest. The film falls flat on almost every level, apart from the music. When you watch this, remember it is called MERLIN. And what do we associate with Merlin? Magic. Something that this film has NOTHING OF! I don't get it. Queen Mab constantly refers to Paganism as `The Old Ways'. I had no trouble understanding that she was referring to Paganism because I have knowledge of this subject. But how on earth is anyone else supposed to know? Nothing is ever explained about the history and friction between ""the old ways"" and christianity. The dialogue and acting throughout the entire film is absurdly lame(very, very bad). That's it. For almost 4 hours! Buy the incredible soundtrack CD, but don't watch this movie!"
1,Dismal. Never has a film been so pretentiously named.,"Not so much one bad movie as three or four bad movies haphazardly stuck together, Merlin lurches from one embarrassing and baffling scene to the next. Terrible dialogue, bad acting, laughably inappropriate theme music, and a special effects department that thinks that enough fog can make anything look good (they're wrong). Gee, how could one possibly resist this?"
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"GEE... I wonder about the so-called ""sources"" people here have been talking about. Poor acting, writing, and the absence of ""sources"" fans claim it was based on makes this one fall short of its mark. ""Merlin"" ranks way down there with the likes of ""A Kid in King Arthur's Court"", and ""Arthur the King""....maybe even lower. If you want to learn about the real Merlin or anything Arthurian, I'd suggest that you watch ""Excalibur"" and read the following books: ""The History of the Kings of Britain"" by Geoffrey of Monmouth, ""Arthurian Romances"" by Chretien de Troyes, ""Le Morte d'Arthur"" by Sir Thomas Mallory, and ""The Traveller's Guide to Arthurian Britain"" by Geoffrey Ashe. It sure beats the comic book ""sources""of ""Merlin""."
5,Enchanting and compelling 'mystical' adventure,"I have studied this movie in great detail and was not at first impressed with all the media hype that came with it. However, after watching it I found myself glued to the screen with nothing detaching me. Miranda 'Queen Mab' is truly a standout in this cast of distinguished actors. She played the part very convincibly and with her gasping voice, long black hair and eye-makeup, and her fantastic powers you couldn't help but not BELIEVE in her. Merlin is a great family movie with hundreds of special effects, mystical creatures and a dual theme which is the demise of the old(pagan) ways and the rise of Christianity. It is also mainly a love story which I strongly recommend you watch."
1,family use,"I was excited to see this movie on dvd, the dvd arrived on time. But I went to watch it and nothing showed up, tried on three other dvd players an still nothinf. So it was returned."
5,This Merlin will blow the others away,If you like Merlin you need to watch this show. It will blow away anything you have ever watched on Merlin. I introduced it to my daughter and she loves it more than the BBC Merlin series or any other Merlin show. You will love it.
1,UNFORGIVABLE,"This film is a complete disaster. What a waste of time expecting something grand like a big screen event after watching the eye-popping trailer on NBC. Merlin, as it turns out, is nothing more than a below average TV movie. Never in my entire life have I ever witnessed a more horrible miniseries. The film's title is a misnomer, as the depiction of Merlin here is about as accurate as that of the Police Academy movies on life in the NYPD. For the producers to put out sloppy dreck like this is totally unforgivable."
1,Undeniably the worst fantasy film ever made .,"Merlin is the worst fantasy film ever made hands down, even worse than First Knight. The original myths were very dark and violent. I can understand the toning down of the violence to make it more suitable for children, but was it necessary to sanitize it to the point of being nothing more than a nursery rhyme fairy tale? Even my kids were so bored by it that they fell asleep half way through the movie. Definitely not worth the price of a rental, not even on Dollar Day Wednesday."
5,Impressive,"Maybe I'm just blind, but i got absolutely no racial prejudice out of this film. For a television production, this movie was superb. I can't find fault with anyone's acting, it encompased a huge scope without leaving any one part feeling stretched or thin, and the story was great. The ending was a little disappointing, but aside from that, it was well worth watching."
1,Go see Excaliber!,"If you are reading this, what are you thinking? Go to search video and check out the reviews for Excaliber!"
1,Teribbly inaccurate!,"I rented this video a few months ago and it was quite annoying and inaccurate. Merlin never converted to Christianity, and ""The Old ways are dying"" part was dreadful.The old celtic religions like wicca have always been very much alive, and it was not until the thirteenth century, which takes place long after Merlin, that witchcraft and everything that went with it in any way disrespected.Morgan LeFay was never ugly, something this film ceases to realize!!!!! (The 'Fay' was gaelic for ""Faery"", and Merlin never gave a damn that King Arthur slept with her.).And nobody even MENTIONS that Morgan LeFay was the protectress of the realm of wales, or that she is synonymous with Nimue and the Lady in the Lake. Like many other false retellings, they do not realize that Lancelot was not one of King arthur's knights, and never even SAW the round table! The bad gal, Queen Mab, was an IRISH goddess of WAR and REVENGE, not an English goddess of witchcraft and magic!"
5,This movie is a MUST!!!!!,"I first saw this movie when I was in Virginia with a few of my friends,and it is great!(it still is!!)I have seen the movie 11 times since then, because I am a big fan of Aurthorian stories.I like the part when Merlin vows to forget about Mab and just walks away."
1,No.,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and the only reason I'm reviewing it is because I have nothing better to do. Frankly, the acting was horrible, the character development was minimal, and the plot was completely distorted. The special effects, while flashy, did not make anything better unless you are attracted to flashing lights and noises (not literally). The ending was thin and unrealistic; and the talking horse seemed to be a last-minute injection into the movie to appeal to kids. Judging from the amount of positive reviews I've read, with titles like ""Classic... a masterpiece"" seem like desperate advertisements and lower my opinion of the general population. I enjoy the Arthurian legends, but this movie was a disgrace."
3,Childhood dreams...,"I remember watching this movie on TV many eons ago, when Merlin was young. My brothers and I were so happy to watch this magical movie. We taped it to perserve for our enjoyment in the years to come. Now I am an adult, and I purchased the DVD. The magic is gone, and my imagination is more vivid with how magic works. Not bad to have nostolgic moments, but will not compare to Harry Potter or other magical movies these days."
4,Merlin,"When I saw this movie in my business trip in Mexico, it gave deep impression to me. I was caught by the story about King Arthur and knights. There were romance and adventures I dreamed. At last I faced the another story. Merlin, Mistic Magician who brought up King Arthur and seed the Knights Story. This is fantastic story you have ever met. You should keep this movie. This is last chance you meet in this centuries."
1,Not even worth buying on DVD.,"Wished I had watched it on TV instead of wasting my money on the DVD. Sam Neill plays a great clown-magician but there's never any real chemistry between him and Paul Curran like there was between Nigel Terry and Nicol Williamson in ""Excalibur"". The plot stretched credibilty to the point of comical proportions. The film had a very Disney-ish make believability about it, the kind where you'd leave the theatre were it not for your 3-year olds tagging along. The effects were so-so and obviously more money was spent on them than a good script. Hopefully, Neill, Short, and Rossellini will be more discerning in their next film roles."
1,Another example of why Hollywood should get its act together,"""Excalibur"" proved that a movie can provide the setting for a spellbinding/magical story, action, intelligent character interactions, and nail-biting suspense. Unfortunately, ""Merlin"" fails miserably on all four counts. The culprits here are obvious plotting, mediocre acting, and pedestrian direction. The film has one legitimate surprise (no plot spoiler here), but it's way too easy to figure out the rest of the action before it happens. Martin Short fares the best of the cast, but he's stuck with the stereotypical role of the bumbling side-kick often found in most slapstick comedy films. Sam Neill shows no screen presence as the main character of Merlin who has to make things right. As for the direction, the film moved too slowly (especially at the beginning). Since I was always sure of MERLIN's outcome (unlike ""Excalibur""), the special effects were the film's only lure, and they were poorly done at best."
2,The mini-series was better.,"The mini-series was fantastic, and although watching the version I had taped off of the television took a long time (approx 4 hours) every minute was worth it. The whole thing had a cohesiveness and momentum that is ruined by the cuts made to fit it into the shorter running time of the commercial release. If you didn't see the miniseries, ""Merlin"" is still a decent movie. For those of you who've already seen the full version of ""Merlin"" ignore this abridged version."
4,Merlin,"I thought this movie was quite good, but it could have used some fine-tuning. They should have worked a bit more on the acting, which was cheesy in parts, but the special effects were great. I would recomend this to anyone who is a fan of Arthurian legends, but if you are new to the the stories of Merlin and Arthur you should probably wait on this one."
1,Way too long for its own good...,"This movie is just way too long. Scenes throughout drag on while failing miserably to reach clear and concise objectives. Take, for instance, when Nimue was tied up as a sacrifice to the Dragon. It ends up being slain by Merlin, but not before Nimue's face is badly burned. The only purpose of this scene: to show Merlin healing it at the end of the film. Then there's Merlin's jesting sidekick Frik. 10 minutes of perfectly good film wasted on his shapeshifting during a dance number in the castle hall. WHY?!?!? Way too long and drawn out, Merlin would've fared no worse had it been cut in half to 1 1/2 hours. Most of this could've been easily accomplished throwing out Frik's character, which does absolutely nothing for the story. It's ironic that the last line in the film was ""No more magic"", because that's the impression I got from beginning to end. NO MAGIC."
2,Falls Flat.,I was so excited about this movie. I watched it when it was on TV and was so disappointed. Totally unmemorable.
5,Fantasy Film That Should Not Be Missed!,"Merlin is one of the most well crafted piece of fantasy tale ever filmed. Never has a film captures the spirit of King Arthur as much as this one although it's base more on the life of Merlin. For a film made for TV, it had an actual cinematic feel to it! Special FX are amazing for a Hallmark miniseries and the film actually executes better than most of the other miniseries such as Arabian Nights and the 10th Kingdom. As for the DVD, it doesn't dissapoints. We are given a HBO making-of(with unseen footages)and detail filmographies of the actors and film makers. The 3D menus themselves are very impresive with a D&D feel to it. The picture quality is as good as you can get; the print is clean and does not show much signs of artifacts or blocking. Sound is in Dolby Surround and displays well at key action scenes of the film. Overall, it deserves to be in every respected DVD collector's shelves. Highly Recommended!"
1,Better in a half hour than in 3 hours,"When my teacher for English told us that we had to do a project about King Arthur, we thought of making a video that would mock a movie that depicted the story of Arthur in a bad way, and we chose Merlin. I must say that Merlin tells the story in a completely different way than was written in sir Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte d'Arthur"", and some of it seems to be made up. Such as, Morgan Le Fey wearing a 20th century leather costume. Arthur didn't get Excalibur from pulling it out of a stone monster. Oh, and about Merlin... he does not live until the very end, he is trapped (by someone other then the evil Morgana) long before that. Well, enough of stating what is wrong with the movie (there is more, but..), because there seems to be a lot of people who really like it. I will say, though, that once we cut down the movie to about a half hour spliced version of it (instead of 3 hours), it was much better to watch."
1,Bad!,"It is beyond my comprehension how such a fine cast would agree to work on something as bad as this. Many of them deliver fine work but don't get much to work with so... This TV-movie suffers mostly from bad script and weak directing. Make better use of your time and money and watch something else, like ""Excalibur""."
1,Is this Merlin supposed to be a mythology or a comedy?,"I laughed throughout the whole movie, because I found it sooo funny. The legends as portrayed here were grossly inaccurate. The bad acting was quite hilarious as the actors seemed to be bumbling through their lines as though they've been hit with a bad case of nitrous oxide or something. Never before has such an assembly of all-star names gathered together to produce such ridiculous poppycock. Almost as ridiculous as Hallmark's other flop, ""Noah's Ark"". As is expected in Hollywood, shelling out millions of dollars for whatever big name star available wins out, while chemistry with the right personnel hardly ever gets a nod. And, coming soon from Hallmark...""The Lost Chronicles Of Jesus Christ... watch as we show you how Christ parted the Red Sea, how he started a revolution in Russia, and how he later went on to found Micorsoft Corp. Hallmark Entertainment. Entertainment par excellence! Entertainment your way!"""
1,Bad script !,"You know after I finished watching this movie I thought to myself that this script had to have been written by 8 year olds! I can't imagine anything else other than a group of second graders sitting around saying.... ""Hey I got a great idea for a movie! Lets get that funny guy from SNL to star in a magical fantasy and have some Kiwi be Merlin and perform unbelievable magic tricks like that David Copperfield... stuff like freeing himself from his chains or making flowers appear out of nowhere. I mean come on! This is totally insipid. Don't take my word for it though, just check out the other horrible comments it has received. I would comment on all the things I found wrong with this film but I dont want to sound like a broken record. I feel my fellow AMAZON users have pretty much covered all the bases."
1,Bad editing = bad movie????,Merlin is the very bad movie. The story does not work very cohesionly(sp?) in a film. Mostly a montage of moments and flashbacks pasted together. Sam Neill did not play the magician well. He looks like how do you say in english the man at the carnival who gets the attention of the people?!?!? I think it's called 'carnival barker'?!?!? King Arthur is ill most times. It's amazing how he can rule competence for 3 hours the land of Britain! I apologize for my very bad english!
1,Good news and bad news.,"The feel that one gets of this movie being geared towards children through the use of sanitizing special effects is quite deceptive indeed. Some of the material herein are questionable, as well is the length of the film. 3 hours is way too long for any child to try and not to sleep through. Having braved through many a cinematic epics myself, I couldn't help but close my eyes from time to time. That was the bad news. Now here's the good news. A special ed. of this DVD is planned with tons of deleted alternative scenes re-inserted and some deleted. The coming new dvd will include the new as the original tv version. From what I've heard the newer version is the director's cut. It's supposed to be way more edgier, so hopefully there'll finally be something available that's almost as good as Excalibur."
3,Does what it needs to.,There's nothing too exciting in the world of filters. It does what it needs to. What else is there to say?
5,Brilliant Book for New Lovers,...Mr. Masterton takes into mind not only women like me but also women who are recently divorced or split from their boyfriend and gives each of us tricks and advice that really teaches you how to make love to your man for the first time. How to please him and make sure you are still enjoying yourself.I would recommend this book for anyone who wants help on how to handle starting a new sexual relationship whether you have prior to now or never have before. It is an excellent book.
3,sensitivity not very linear,"It works, but the sensitivity seems to go from zero to 100% at exactly 3/4 of the turn of the sensitivity dial. Also, I cannot seem to get it to properly come on when it should AND go off afterwards. The problem is that the heat from the bulbs sometimes cause the thing to stay on - ALL NIGHT. If I push the detector down at all, then it doesn't properly detect anything. Lame."
2,Motion Sensors,Range said to be 70 feet but in reality it appears to be more like 25 feet. Next time I will go with a new LED model.
4,Pretty Good Replacement Unit,"My old sensor unit went dead (the front plastic lens decomposed)on me after 10 years so I purchased this unit because of the good reviews. As it turns out, my old unit was the same model as this one.After installation, the unit would not turn off during the first night. Next day I used a small mirror to reflect the sun light directly at the bottom light sensor for a second and that did the trick. It's been working flawlessly ever since.The only complain I have is that the 1-minute on position left the light on for 5 minutes not 1 minute. That's OK with me but it does reduces my options. Haven't checked what the 5-minute position will leave the light on for yet."
1,Worse item I ever ordered!,I cannot believe how cheap this thing was made. Handle fell apart the very first time I used it. There are 4 sections and 2 broke. The cleaner Bona) is good. I have always used that on my wood floors. The pads work good too. Why the handle has to be in sections I do not know. The sections are connected with plastic and not metal........
3,mop handle broke on first mopping,my mop handle broke during my first use of this product. I sent bona an email and within a couple of days I had a new (better) mop. The cleaner does a great job cleaning my hardwood floors. Great service from this company!!!!
3,No assembly instructions and mop fell apart!,"I just ordered this mop and it came with absolutely NO instructions for assembling the mop. The assembly was not ""common sense"", as I tried to work it out with no instructions and the pieces kept falling apart. Finally, one of the connector pieces got stuck inside the tube way down. So out comes the duct tape. It's helpful to know that CS replaced your mop. Hopefully, I will have the same success. I haven't even tried the mop yet, but hope that it works better than the assembly went!"
2,Bona does leave a film,i tried that Bona on my dark hard wood floors and it leaves a film. I have tried at least 3 different cleaners and they all left a film. I don't know what else to use.
2,Great cleaner. Lousy mop handle.,"I recommend getting the cleaner but not the crummy mop handle. It broke the second day. I won't even bother to complain at the store. What are they going to do? Give me another bad handle? Well, maybe I'll do that anyway and also complain to the Bona company.Note to self: Don't buy any more 4 piece plastic made in China mop handles.The cleaner did polish the floor well, however. No complaint there."
2,The mop handle broke in less than two weeks,I like the cleanser; it is non-toxic. I like the pad; it is washable. I ordered a second pad so that I would always have a clean pad ready. But the handle broke in less than two weeks. I have to confess that I had read that it had happened to someone else in an earlier review. I figured it must be an anomaly. I have trouble applying enough pressure to use a rotary cutter and yet this mop handle broke at one of the joints.I personally would try the cleanser with another mop and pad system.The mop rates zero stars.This is the first hardwood floor cleaner I have purchased. I do not know how it compares to other cleansers.I just didn't want someone else to get ready to use the mop only to have it break and have to wait to clean until you can purchase another mop.
2,disappointed,"I was looking for a floor cleaner that would give the same shine as my previous one (It used to be the previous owner's cleaner and I thew away the bottle without checking what the name of the cleaner was). I tried floor cleaners which were available in stores but they didn't give the same shine as my old one. So, I started looking for cleaners online and I came across this product with pretty much good reviews. I really thought I found the right cleaner to my hardwood floors but I was very disappointed...the mop works good but the cleaner just didn't do much. I eventually had to switch back to orange glo and and just used the mop with it...I think it gives a better shine than bona."
3,UPDATE...... I now give it a ***** FIVE STAR.,"While we did like the BonaKemi 4-Piece Hardwood Floor-Care System, and do believe that it is a good product, our item came with a piece missing. Therefore, it obviously cannot work properly. I did leave some feedback on this item, and hope to receive a solution to this problem. This is why I only gave this item a 3 star review. Had all the pieces been in the package, I would have given it a 5 star review.I just talked with Amazon.com customer service, and they are sending me a return label, for this item, and, so we were very pleased with this gesture. They placed a new order for me and the new BonaKema 4-Piece floorcare system should be here within a week! ***** :)Amazon.com is really a classy company. I will update my rating once the new one comes. I have a feeling it will be getting a FIVE STAR RATING! :)"
2,Bona hardwood floor care system,"The Bono hardwood floor care system is a great product, however, the handle is made very cheep and fell apart on us after a few uses. It must not have been an American made product."
2,I love the cleaner but the mop stick broke after one use!,The BonaKemi cleaner is amazing. It leaves no residue and cleans very well. I love the microfiber mop cloth but the stick is so bad. It broke on just one use! I would recommend just buying the cleaner solution alone...
4,Great Product-junk handle,"The BonaKemi Wood Floor Cleaning system was recommended by a professional home maid who I hire on occasion. Product works great leaving shiny woods floors without the residue of other products. Like other reviewers, the handle is weak and broke the second time time I used it. To the manufacturer's credit, they shipped a new telescoping metal handle (much stronger) and extra pads without charge that arrived within a few days of my call. The new handle will be included as standard in the near future per Bona. Otherwise, product really works well. Customer service was excellent."
2,Cleaner is great - mop is really poor quality and broke on third use,"I have been happy with the cleaner, but the mop is incredibly poorly made and snapped off in two places on the third use. Could not believe it. Skip the mop (which had it worked would have been great as it has a wide sweep and the attachments are easy to put on with the velcro system). Really disappointing."
5,Best Product for Wood Floors,This is the best product for wood floors. The mops is worthless but the product is great in cleaning and maintaining a great clean shine throughout my house.
1,Broke within a year,I have no complaints about the cleaning solution or the cleaning pads. The cleaner itself is flimsy and broke within a year. You have to push down fairly hard for the wet cleaning pad to actually clean the floor. The cleaner broke at one of the joints along the stick. Poor design and a waste of money. The Swiffer cleaner is much stronger and easier to use.
3,The Quiet Invasion,"Kinda silly alien\human contact story. It was particulary difficult to get into the long winded interactions of the weird aliens. Trying to remember alien names is a pain. Who was the bad guy? Who was the good guy? Who cares. How does a biological based creature survive the extreme atmosphere of Venus without artificial protection? What did these aliens evolve in an acid pressure cooker? I think a brief explanation of how that might have come about would have helped. But, it wasn't a total wash. Not the best, but interesting enough that I finished it. Okay, that's it."
2,Cannot Recommend at Current Price,"This is a decent salsa that I paid $14.70 for in November 2011. The price has more than doubled in four months. What was a relative bargain, is now overpriced for the level of quality, and is one of the most expensive salsa's that Amazon lists.What you get is a very tomatoey salsa with a bit of bite."
3,embasa canned salsa,"There was nothing wrong with the taste, but there were too few vegetable bits, contrary to what's shown on the label. This makes a nice taco sauce, but if you want a satisfying dipping salsa, look elsewhere."
4,"As Ingrid Hoffman says, ' Simply Delicioso ' , Food Network","Easy to Open. I like this small, Red Can. Very cute. Slightly, Spicy.Delicious. Love this, espec for, Soft Flour Tortilla - Amazon Prime.As Food Network's New Star, Ingrid Hoffman, from Miami FL; says - Adore her - Saturday Mornings, Repeated on Sundays; Love the Commercials, It's'Simply Delicioso'.

2,Didn't work for me,"For some reason this just leaves my face patchy, my old 805rx worked better, maybe the new SpeedXL is better."
4,"Good Shaver, but some questions","I have bought this shaver,quite good.but there are still questions about this item:1, I can't fine the manufacture of this shaver body, is this shaver made in Holland?2, The model charactor on the back of shaver is dim. Is this shaver reconditioned?3, The full shaving time is 35 minutes not 45 minutes as ads.4, The price was $57 and now is $97.but anyway, it is a good shaver. I like it."
5,Twelve Months of Monastery Soups,"Twelve Months of Monastery SoupsI bought this book to help with my column in my Master Gardener newsletter. My recipes are chosen to utilized the bounty from our gardens. This book does this well, I use it often, always giving credit to the Monks. While reading this book I can almost feel the Monks next to me. It is a lovely feeling any time I use it. Each month they feature a recipe using the produce that is in season, Squash soup for November and so on. If you love soup this book is one you will enjoy. You will also like some of the comments at the bottom of the page for each month."
4,seasonal soups,This is a wonderful book. I really like the fact that the soups are arranged by season so that one could purchase fresh ingredients. There is enough variety to choose from for each month according to time available and budget. I wish that they would have included more information about monastery life though.
4,Great oldy but goody soups!,"I like soups in the winter in particular, and this book caught my eye because it has many of my favorite ones that I had almost forgotten about and new ones that got me even more intrigued."
1,Bland-tasting soups,"Our family loves soups and that's basically all we eat in the wintertime. After reading so many postive reviews, I decided to purchase this book hoping to add a few more favorites to our reportoire. I was very disappointed though. The soups ranged from bland-tasting to downright unpalatable and we tried several of the recipes. I recommend ""Skinny Soups"" by Ruth Glick and Nancy Baggett instead- wonderful flavors and many vegetarian soups and meat soups that taste good even even if you decide to leave the meat out."
3,"Okay for Beginners, But Not a Lot to Offer for Most Cooks","These are easy recipes that call for readily available ingredients, so beginning cooks may find this cookbook a place to start their soup making adventures. However, those who have learned to love making soup ""from scratch"" will find little new.A second weakness that keeps this from being no more than a 3 star book is that many of the recipes are only slight variations of each other. Rather than ""almost 200"" soups, it seems as though there are perhaps a dozen or so basic recipes included--predominantly vegetable, based on onions, carrots, potatoes and other additions and bean, with only slight variations in the remaining ingredients.The book would have been better had it been arranged by basic soup type with suggestions for variations. In this way, the novice soup maker could start with the recipes and then begin to make his or her own variations to suit the seasonal ingredients available."
5,Great soup recipes,"I've had this cookbook for a couple of years now. A couple of things I love about it is 1) it has a easy to use index so if you have some particular ingredient you want to use, look it up and it lists the soups page number. 2). Many of the ingredients I have on hand and it is not an exhausting amount either. One more 3) it has recipes from different countries which makes interesting history table talk:)"
4,Japan Horror new experience,"Slit-Mouthed Woman is a great movie for horror fans. I recomend it for everybody. Befor I only watch American Horror, but now new experience. But about Zombie Dead, which come in the same DVD it is a crap."
4,First Sue Foley Album For Me,"Sometimes impulse buys work out. My thanks to the Amazon reviewer. It's hard for me to believe that this is an unrehearsed, 1st take, live performance. Sue and her band must know one another inside and out. They're unplugged but on fire as they plow their way through the set. Sue is sassy and sexy and definitely in charge of the room. The song ""Sugar In My Bowl"" nearly melted the fillings in my teeth. LOL Now if I could get somebody who's reading this review to tell me which Sue Foley album to pick up next."
2,Later cd much better,"Sorry Sue. I loved ""Used Car"" but this one leaves a bit to be desired. Will look for more of your latest music. She has a wonderful voice and all the music on the Used Car cd are good."
2,Didn't Grab Me,I have a couple other Sue Foley CD's and really like them. So I bought this one based on the reviews listed here only to discover that they must have been written by devout fans suffering from buyer's guilt. The disc seems to lack emotion and to call it raw is an understatement. She can do much better and has in the past ...... this a poor effort.
2,This is not an original book.,"This type of story has come up before. There is at least one novel that I know of the Classic Trek series that is pretty much the same as this novel. This Novel is pretty much predictable in all senses, and you know, as well as I do, that none of the main characters ever die. Just the ones that are extras. Deana could have died, but she was saved. I don't recommend this novel if you want to read something that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Yet, this novel does keep you slightly intrigued if you let it."
2,The plot is absurd,"Data's ""revolutionary scientific experiment"" is unbelievable. The outcome is predictable, so it simply wasn't enjoyable. There are far better TNG books to read. Also annoying is how Deanna Troi is addressed as ""Lieutenant Commander"" despite the fact that she is a full Commander (even the three solid pips on her uniform on the cover of the book indicates this)."
2,Ah! Another one of those save-a-planet books.,"I found this book to be boring and unoriginal. Also, I'm not much of a scientist but I don't really think you can make a planet travel through a wormhole."
4,ELO Jeff Lynne Remastering!!!,This is a great remastering of a fine album! ELO and Jeff Lynne are getting some well deserved respect in 2001 that's looooong overdue. Congrats to remastering albums and to the new album ZOOM!
3,ELO runs flat,I'm a big ELO fan from the 1970's when A New World Record was released and drugs were big and mostlyNo big deal LSD was King! However this work seems to be a bunch of leftovers mix and match withoutThe thrill and excietment as before but who knows maybe it may take some more spins and a few moreBongs and some greydot(lsd25).
3,Great Sound - But Beginning Of The End,"ELO was out of place in the pop music scene by the time this was released in 1983. Some flashes of the old ELO are present, but the sound is dated compared to the band's 1970's work. Still the reissue sounds great and the bonus tracks are a welcome addition, especially when compared to the 1986 release ""Balance of Power"", which hasn't been reissued yet."
5,Trojan Football History,An entertaining review of the glory times in USC football history. Interesting for any college football fan and a must for Trojan fans.
3,Enjoyable mainly for USC alum and fans,"As an alum I couldnt wait to get this video as soon as it came out. It was entertaining as an overview of the history of 'SC football, but left me hungry for more. Especially more highlights of Marcus Allen, OJ, and the other Heisman winners. Also, some more dwell time on the greatest games vs Notre Dame, UCLA, and the Rose Bowls. Wish it had been a 2-disc set more along the lines of the NFL Films history series now out."
4,Workout on the beach,"We homeschool and need exercise routines for days we just can't get outside or mom's too busy to come up with indoor games in small spaces... :)I like this video. 2 different workouts, manageable length, even the 4yo (now 5) can do most of it. 8yo says he'd only give it a 2.5 star rating because of a couple aerobic moves that are tricky (I have trouble with them, too), but I think on the whole he enjoys it as well. Pleasant scenery, everyone's mostly covered (I do wish his female co-leads wore shorts instead of leotards, but at least they're covered.) Gilad has a sense of humor that's a little different, but my boys seem to enjoy it.All in all, I like it well enough that I will be purchasing another (there are 3 separate DVDs available).We also recommend Billy Blanks Tae Bo for kids - it's longer/harder but high energy and good workout. We alternate between Gilad and Billy. ;)"
5,Hermoso y refrescante,"Este disco es uno de mis preferidos. Es cierto que no conoci a Serrat en su epoca dorada, porque si bien lo eschuche un par de veces era muy chica para poder disfrutarlo como ahora lo disfruto. Este disco se presta para escucharlo a solas o acompanado, se disfruta mucho y sus canciones tienen un gran sentido. Lo recomiendo a todos y se que quedaran fascinados con este tipo tan especial que es Serrat"
1,Don't be tempted,"I bought this DVD expecting to learn about the challenges of bringing ever increasing power to the road, about electronics, engine layout and architecture, about the changing regulations, etc, etc....What a disappointment.None of the above. Actually I have forgotten already what is was about : some tame and lame, generic PR blah blah like ""honda remains committed to racing"", ""changes for 2008 were: improved traction, better stability, increased turn in..."" (that's what I say about MY road bike after some suspension set-up or bling...) It goes on like that, unbelievable absence of content or matter, brand after brand with remarkably little variation.What a waste of money - and time."
4,Good Gift,"I purchased this item for my boyfriend who has nearly every motorcycle racing DVD out there. He really enjoyed the overview of the different teams and their evolution. The music was a little cheesey, but didn't really interfere with the movie overall."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Waste of time!!! Don't even bother wasting your money. Volume 1 is way better, and had more performances than this one."
4,enjoyable,My nephew was very happy with the dvd. I only order these type of dvds for him; i am not into rappers at all
2,"Well-played, yet boring","Walls of Jericho play tight and ferocious metalcore, but the breakdowns are predictable, full of second-rate Pantera riffs. Pedaling on open strings can only go so far, and without solos, melody, or other textures, the songs eventually run together. Singer Candace Kucsulain has an interesting voice, but ends up sounding same-y after a while. Seldom has music so well-played been so boring."
3,Its ok,"Ok im a big fan of metal bands with chick singers and i will go out of my way to listen to them cause the really are so few and far between. And i bought this cd just because it was a chick singer but i was a little disapointed it all kinda sounds the same to me nothing really memorable in any of the songs it. and all the lyrics are done in the scream and it just kinda get old after awhile. i enjoy screaming as much as the next guy but i also like clean lyrics as well i think it adds to the music it mean that the singer can actually sings and have melody and that is important. SO what im saying if you like girl screaming 100% of the time then go and get this cd but if you want to listen to the best chick fronted band of all times then listen to otep, she can sing she can rap and she and growl like no other girl on earth execpt maybe the girl from arch enemy but thats just insane."
4,Real info for Everybody,"Love this book! I purchased three books in preparation for my community college dance concert. This one was the best for my needs--well-written in a friendly, accessible style. Definately a guidebook for the non-engineer, non-technical, non-mechanically inclined person. A big help!"
3,interesting Czech film,"This movie was directed by Jiri Weiss, a Czech filmmaker that was part of Czech's film new wave. It's filmed in an fascinating way and it has a good jazzy score. Murder Czech Style is about a plain middle-aged clerk who marries a beautiful woman, much to the surprise of his co-workers. But there's a catch in it, she only comes down on weekends and their marriage never consummates. He soon learns the reason why, his wife is having an affair with the office manager. The last hour runs out of steam as the character goes through a few murder scenarios. 2.5 rounded to 3."
4,What's the difference?,I couldn't tell any difference between these less expensive cables and some more expensive ones so you better believe that I will buy these again if I need to.
4,A very good representation of this genre of music,"Having been bred on rock n' roll through most of my life, I am uncertain why I am drawn so inexorably toward this type of music. It must be due, in part, to the inherantly sweet sound of the dulcimer. It is played nicely here in conjunction with other instruments such as the fiddle, banjo, etc. and acts as a nice compliment to all of them. There is nothing profound here. It is merely good, early American music showing well its Celtic roots. It'svery soft, sweet and soothing and, even in its livelier moments, quite relaxed. Some of the tunes, such as Lochaber No More, are rather touching. If you fight traffic to and from work each day, or experience other tentions, this can be a soothing antidote."
2,Short Life....No Response at Sales or Customer Service,"Product works well initially but beware of product life LESS THAN the 10-year warranty. I have 7 on my home. The motion sensor has now failed on two of them. I called the 800 number at Desa and chose ""Sales"". No answer after 25 rings. I then tried ""Tech Support"". Put on hold for 20 minutes with music....never got through....I just gave up. Suggest you find another supplier. Maybe they are all poor products."
2,Can it really be cool?,"This product keeps the 360 cool to a certain point, but then it constantly freezes the game system up and shuts it down. Since I have remove it from my system I haven't had the problem anymore."
4,Intercooler works for me,"There are alot of negative reviews of the product, but so far it's been working great for me. I just got done playing about 4 hours worth of gaming and my 360 is the coolest it's been ever. Normally, i.e. without the Intercooler, the 360 would be pretty warm, but is much cooler now with this device. I tried a couple of positions and found setting the 360 horizontally raised without covering the vents on the bottom to work the best. Again, I've never seen my 360 run so cool until this particular setup with the 360 and the intercooler..."
2,way way too loud,couldnt notice much variation in temp to the touch....and also very very loud and always on....not worth it unless u have serious overheating problems
1,Do Not Buy This Product,1. it is very noisy2.it melts the back of your xbox3.it doesn't keep it cool
1,Over time its wrose for your xbox360,I got my xbox360 early June2006 I was so happy to finaly have one. The one thing that worried me was that the 360 can over heat very fast and do damg and here I am with my new 360 right in the begining of the summer with even more heat.So I got this about July2006. The first few months it worked really well....but in september2006 my 360 became corrupted. so I had to do a system restore and I lost all my game data.Next month it happend again.so now I've lost my game data twice now. I called the xbox360 support line about this and its like what everyone been saying.this intercooler starts out nice but then it starts to HURT your 360 over time. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Ineffective if console already overheated,"I bought this device 3 days after my console began freezing up after 15 min of play w/ the ""red circles of death"". Unfortunately, it has had no effect. I am reasonably sure that it is a console overheating problem because the back of the unit gets very hot as well as the game discs while the battery brick remains cool (because I have a fan directly blowing on it).However, I still have hopes that it will be an effective PREVENTIVE measure once I get my replacement unit."
1,Nyko Intercooler,I was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system. I sent it back and got another one. The second intercooler did not work either. It makes a nice paperweight!!
3,Dont know what people are complaining aboot!,"Everyone elses intercooler fan seems to be melting their xbox 360, i have used mine for the 3 years ive had my xbox 360 and as a result it has never overheated. It is true that it is loud as hell i just for the first time turned on my xbox 360 without it and i thought it was broken because it was so quiet."
2,Worked for me.. Didn't melt but LOUD!!!,"Forgive the short review but the subject pretty much sums it up.. Mine actually helped in terms of cooling and made a noticeable difference but it is so ridiculously loud brand-new out of the box you will be debating if you even care to use it. Then after a few months when the bearings in the fans get dusty or whatever, it gets REALLY loud.. After it runs for a while it quiets back down but still inexcusable in an era of bearing-less fans.Not recommended."
1,Damages XBOXs,"We had an XBox 360 for 2 months. I purchased the cooler thinking it could only help. Next day after plugging it in we got the ring of death. We shipped the xbox back to the company we got it from, and recieved another refurbished unit. Before we even started this unit we put the Intercooler fan on, and {you guessed it}the ring of death happened. We shipped the xbox back again and never used the intercooler again. System has worked great ever since."
1,It SUCKS,"Plugged it into my xbox autmomatically got red lights for poor power connection. wiggled it came on. xbox took longer to boot then normal. started playing it and the system suddenly crashed, friend who is a manager at game stop said remove that @#$@ fan. Did as directed no issues, says gets the xbox's and fans coming back all the time, never works and only damages the systems, or causes issues. Not sure why but thats what he told me and i can atest to that to this day no issues since i removed it, if u have one on ur system remove it asap so u dont have to buy a new 1!!!!!"
2,Never cooled off the xbox,"This never cooled off my friends Xbox. I got him this to avoid an overheating issue he had been trying to avoid like all other people at the time. Bottom line was it's intended function didn't perform and his Xbox shut down as a result of an overheated circuit board (To be fair, my friend plays games for an extended period of time, none the less this should have at least helped."
1,Xbox 360 melt down,DO NOT GET!!! This cooler melts the power cable port on your xbox 360 and makes it unusable. get one that uses its own power source
2,Works but NOISY,"I've owned two of these. One of the original ones (plastic power adapter) and newer (metal power adapter).Pros:Does it's job very well. 360 was noticeably cooler under stress.Looks decentIf it fails (noise only), it still pumps air out [see TS review below]Cons:Both units became very noisy after a few months. Not unbearably loud, but annoying (bearings in fans fail)Steals power from the motherboard...possibly leading to RROD/failure?Also...newer TS model seems better since it has its own power cord and temperature sensor.HOWEVER if this unit fails as some say it has, it will actually block air from exiting your xbox since the fans don't turn on. This pretty much guarantees you frying your xbox. Not worth the risk in my opinion."
1,Makes ZERO sense,"Ok this item makes no logical sense whatsoever. The fan sits on the back. The back is the main vent of air and why the heck would you want to blow the air back in? I dont know about you guys but that just doesnt make sense to me. If you are going to buy a fan for your 360 then buy one of the stand fans. They make sense because they blow air in the RIGHT way, through the actual intended vents."
1,a piece of junk,this system will mess up your 360 it started to make my system crash so i removed immediately now 360 is working fine
1,Terrible.....,"This item does indeed melt your system I cant tell you how many complaints i recieve everyday at work I currently work at Cirucit City and im a product specialist for 360 the intercooler overheats the system and/or makes it impossible for the system to read discs. My opinion is to keeps your system ventilated and on top of solid surfaces, not carpets."
1,"NO GOOD, DON'T BUY EVER!","This product fries and ruins XBOXes!!! Once you put this on your machine, Microsoft voids the manufactuer warranty... Basically, it steals needed power from the XBOX and uses it for the cooling fans. This creates an issue of overheating--in some cases frying the XBOX and or melting the plastic and singing the intercooler to the XBOX! So there, DON'T EVER BUT THIS PRODUCT. DAMN YOU NYKO!!!"
1,This thing sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i bought this a few months ago and it worked well....... until i rearanged my room. the new location fo the xbox had it so it was on a shelf laying sideways. not only is it loud but it has no clip for the power cable. THE POWER CABLE IS CONSTANTLY FALLING OUT. IT COST ME 120 BUCK FOR A NEW HARD DRIVE BECAUSE IT FELL OUT WHEN I WAS DOWNLOADING SOMETHING AND IT CRASHED MY HARD DRIVE. THIS A PIECE OF @%$&. DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,Do Not Buy!,All I can say is I know 4 people with this device and these same 4 people had to send in their 360 for component failure. Do not install this device or a surge protector on your Xbox (already has a surge protector) as the loss is power draw will cause the failure. Not sure why Microsoft has not stopped this company from selling this damaging product.
1,Please save your 360 and don't buy this,I want people that are thinking about getting this to know that it's not what it's cracked up to be. Because it sits between your 360 and the 360's power cord it's actually taking some of the power that the 360 depends on and in which case the system isn't getting all of the power that it's depending on. This just isn't good for any system. Please look for a different product because this is going to cause a headache that just isn't worth it.
1,No good!,My xbox overheated even with this thing on. It eventually shorted out and stopped working altogether. Defenitely not worth the money as it pretty much does nothing but pose a hazzard to your xbox.
1,Another One Bites The Dust,"Like so many others , my 360 was destroyed by this piece of junk . The connections were all secure and I rarely play for more than a couple of hours at a time . Not only does this product void the warranty , Microsoft service will refuse to even look at the melted 360 . So if it happens to you , you might as well throw it in the trash and buy a new 360 . The XBOX360 has a great warranty do not void it with this product !"
1,crap,this thing fried my xbox power supply. and caused the xbox to get a red ring several times before frying it. if your looking for a cooler for your 360 get the pelican one or the fan stand. draws almost no power and keeps the xbox cool.
1,"Does its job, just not well",Basically this cooler will probably kill your console but it does make it cooler since you'll have a system that dosent work. Microsoft will not replace you console for using this third party peripheral and nyko will not give you a refund for their product or your now useless 360. It leaves you screwed from every aspect. I reccomend just letting your 360 break on its own and take advantage of microsofts guaranteed warranty that last until 2011.
1,Noisy but Functional,"These coolers seem to have a problem with getting very noisy suddenly, like something is binding up inside one of the fans. It has happened to me twice, i traded the other one back in now my new one does it too. They start off fine then suddenly BAM!That being said the cooler is very functional and helpful in cooling off your xbox. I couldn't believe the amount of heat this pulled out."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! IT WILL BREAK YOUR XBOX,"I recently had to pay a third party vendor to PRY this item off of my Xbox 360 Elite. You see when Xbox was created it wasn't designed well, it generates too much heat inside the case and that heat WILL FUSE, MELT TO, PERMANENTLY ATTACH, this device to your Xbox.Oh and it's from a NON-MICROSOFT Vendor, so it voids the warranty when you send it in to them, or remove it yourself.Buy a usb laptop cooler instead, airflow is really all you need.P.S. I gave it one star because 'no stars' was not an option!"
1,Nyko Intercooler is NOT an accesory that Microsoft recommends!,"I happen to process calls for Toys R Us. Just a few weeks ago, I received a call that involved a complaint from one of our Toys R Us guests in regards to this cooler causing glitches, freezing up the console, etc. The guests Xbox 360 console had to be sent by the Guest out to Microsoft to have the console repaired. Plus the guest had to pay the shipping charges to send it out to Microsoft. When the guest had spoken to Microsoft prior to the repair, the guest was told by Microsoft to remove the device from the console completely and informed that such after market parts should not be used on the console and that this device is something that is NOT recommeded by Microsoft. After my work shift, I myself called Microsoft to confirm this and it is true...they don't recommend you use this device...The Nyko Intercooler."
1,Brick-maker,"I had a 360 since launch. It worked fine and I could leave it on for days downloading from live marketplace. I could also leave a game on pause for a day or two. I did swap it out due to a faulty vid card, so when I got a brand new 360 (manufactured 5.20.06) I thought I'd try to prolong its life with an intercooler. Too bad it didn't last a week before I got the Red Ring of DEATH on a brand new 360. Buy at your own risk, but I honestly think we should leave the cooling to what the MS engineers designed."
1,Read This it is the TRUTH,"This product is meant to cool down your Xbox 360. However a very bad side effect is that it builds up moisture. Moisture is, as you can imagine, VERY bad for electronic devices. It does not allow all the hot air to leave, so it gets trapped and evaporates.My Story: I purchased this item thinking it would help cool down my XBOX 360. When my xbox is on it heats my room up about 10 degrees. At first it worked. It was noticeably cooler in my room. After about a week I experienced the ""red ring"". I researched a little bit and found that people had been having the same problem. However, from what I have heard not everyone has this problem. So, in conclusion, I suggest you stay away from this, but if you want to take your chances, I can not guarantee this will not work for this."
1,Terrible,I bought one of these for my new 360. The stupid thing wouldn't plug in because I got one of the new falcon chip jobs with the different power supply. Then my buddy who had one on his original-release 360 had it killed it. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone I actually like.
3,Nyko Intercooler - Its a Jet engine in disguise.,"I purchased this for my Xbox 360 Pro, thinking that it would have cooling problems like the others. I am all for cooling however with this new revision of the 360 the Intercooler is no longer necessary (unless your house is a kiln). The device attached easily and without much tension. I was able to install and play within minutes. The one thing that I don't like is that there is no throttling based on temperature built in. Thus the device makes more noise than it should.Overall, I prefer not to use this device as it really annoys me with its constant hum. However it does provide a decent airflow for the already bulky system."
1,!!!!WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"WARNIGN EVERYONE DO NOT BUY THIS!!! first of all, this will DESTROY your Xbox360, and microsoft will NOT repalce or fix it because this device is not made by microsoft! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"I bought this hoping to increase the lifespan on my 360. I hoped that cooling the 360 would be better for it in the long run. Unfortunately, I might have done the opposite. A red ring blinks around the power button every time I tried to turn it on, and it turns out the culprit was the burned Nyko Intercooler. Seriously. There were scorch marks along the inside of the power input. This thing is a fire hazard. Please do not buy it!"
1,beware,"you should not, for any reason, EVER consider buying one of these. when i purchased my brand new 360, i wanted to protect my investment in every possible way. since i heard rumors of the system overheating, i bought this cheap intercooler for 20 dollars. BIG mistake. my 360 worked flawlessly until i started using this device. it effectively ruined my 360. luckily, i was still within my 30 day return limit, so i got all my money back for the system. otherwise, i would have been totally screwed out of 400 bucks.the reviews you are reading on here are NOT isolated incidents. i repeat, do not, under any circumstances, buy this product."
1,Red Ring of Death Imminent,"This cooler causes more problems than it solves. It killed our Xbox 360 and gave us the ""Red Ring of Death,"" (three of the rings around the power switch blink red, indicating a component failure). If you haven't heard about this you should do a search and read about it. The first thing the Microsoft tech asked when we called was if we had a cooler on the Xbox. Using an unlicensed product, which this is, can void your warranty. Use at your own risk. You shouldn't dismiss this issue out of hand, too many other people have reported similar experiences."
1,Not Recommended,I bought this item thinking the 3 fans would keep the 360 from overheating inside my A/V cabinet; it did not. I still have issues with the HD-DVD player overheating when connected to the 360.After about a month the fans started making awful noises when first powered on and would take about 2 minutes for the noise to go away. I've recently noticed that 2 of the fans have now completely failed and do not spin. This could potentially cause more heat than cooling since it covers the back of the 360.I'm going to give it one more try- I'm sending this one back for a replacement. Based on this experience I would not buy this item again or recommend it.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"the first time i put this on and turned the x-box on the system ran for about 30 seconds and the front light on the x-box that is usually green starts flashing red and then the x-box just shuts down. i tried taking it off and turning the console on and everything ran fine, i put it back on and the same exact thing happened. this is absoutely not a quality item and is a waste of money!"
3,it works...sort of,In the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well. But as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it.
1,Its not a game,"Amazon has the star rating for this as a game. Its not a game, but still deserving of one star. It was more of an obstruction than help. I wound up replacing the stock internal fans with some good stuff."
1,"Great idea, but very bad design and quality","Do not buy this all you will do is more harm to your xbox and your self then is necessary. First off the thing is extraordinary loud (you think the xbox fans are loud now, this thing is like being next to a airplane engine) second the bottom fan died on me with in a week (I only used it twice because of how loud it was), so on in on it's very bad product that if you do buy your not going to use it for more then 10 minutes before you think, wow I could have used that money for something better that won't sit in its original box in the attic for a year in a half like mine has and will continue."
2,Cooler,Cooler takes away power from Xbox. Sometimes creating problems with function of Xbox. The new version has a seperate plug not requiring using the power for the xbox. Recommend that cooler rather than this one.The seller is a good seller though.
4,So far.... So Good....,"So after combing the internet and finding information about the nyko intercooler, I must say I was (and still am) skeptical. So far I've had the cooler hooked up for about 2 weeks. I havent had any of the complaints listed here as well as other internet sources yet (melting plastic, power drain, etc.). The 360 does seem noticably cooler to the touch and games on my HDTV do not seem any different. The increased noise is very noticable, especially since my console is on a desktop and I am sitting at a desk playing. However if it was in a component shelf I dont think it would make any difference as the 360's fan is already fairly audible.Overall, I am happy with the performance of the product. It does what the box says it does. I am worried about long term effects of the product simply from the comments I've read on the internet, HOWEVER none of the major game/hardware reviewers (i.e. Gamespot, CNet, 1UP, etc.) have mentioned the potential hazards to the 360."
3,Works Great,What I like to do is set up a bunch of downloads in my xbox live queue and just leave my 360 on all night. Well in the morning the 36 would ultimately be burning hot and the surface it was on would be extremly hot as well. I don't feel the heat on the surface anymore and I feel safe leaving my xbox on all night knowing it wont burn up. Cool to the touch the fan gets really hot although. Not sure if that will eventually cause damage to the fan but the 360 stays cool and thats what matters to me
2,360 Intercooler,"Now I dont know if it is just the XBOX but this ""Intercooler"" did help to keep my XBOX 360 cool to the touch but I have had to exchange my XBOX twice for internal overheating. The second time I actually had the INTERCOOLER and it still overheated....not to mention it sounds like a jet engine when fan is fully engaged....XBOX needs to do something about this!"
2,not working,"i might just have a lemon, but after plugging mine in the first time, my system wasnt getting power, so it wouldnt start-up. havent tried it again since last week."
1,"Re: Nyko responds to so-called defects..., November 16, 2006","In response to their message ""Any number of reasons from a power spike, to using the Xbox 360 without a surge protector could have caused damage.""I have spoke with a 360 tech and the big grey box between the plug in the wall and the plug into the 360 is a surge protecter. She said most people don't know this and should not plug there 360 into a surge protector because it could cause errors.Just FYI!!!"
2,NyKo GONE bad,I bought this cooler about 7 months ago Just to make sure my Xbox 360 wouldn't over heat. Well it did its job for the first 4 months. after that The thing just got louder and louder. Now it makes horrific annoying noises. I also have found that my green light turns to red and gives me two diffrent errors. one is 67 and the other is 68 I don't know what they are. I have the extended warranty so i called them to report the problem just for future references.Overall IT did its job just didn't Do it long enough.
1,This killed my 360 too.,"This is not a good product, before I bought this product my XBOX 360 was working perfectly fine for almost a year and a half. The thing is I had no idea what the reviews were for this product before I bought it. I found out it was a terrible product, so I had it returned. As I am speaking right now it is three months after I bought this product and now I just bought a two year warranty and shipping my 360 for repairs. Moral of this story, don't buy anything if you have no idea what you're buying or how good it works or in this case doesn't. And secondly, don't buy anything that is not backed by the manufactorer in this case microsoft."
1,Too much trouble.,"Loud. Poor fitting connection, so much so I even returned one thinking it didn't work. Took a great deal of muscle to complete the connection, and still the power cord keeps working its way loose. A waste of $20. Better to ensure your XBOX has proper ventilation in the first place, and take a break now and then."
1,Xbox intercooler,"This was a Christmas gift. It never did work right. Did not return because of time, but can't get it off my mind. BIG waste of money. Bought one at Walmart and works great."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"although the intercooler is a perfect idea, there are allot of problems with it. The XBOX 360 does get very hot because it has extremely powerful components. The intercooler does not work. If the intercooler fries your system, which it probably will, your warenty will void."
1,No need to spend money on the intercooler,"I was thinking about the intercooler and the other cooling device that's on sale. But I realize that their are other inexpensive ways to keep you 360 cool.Right now, I've placed my 360 near a fan and it's keeping my system pretty damn cool. No more heat issues that were scaring the hell out of me. Imagine making an investment for this device and then getting burned when you touch it. LOL.So as an alternative to buying the cooling units, you can just have you 360 near a fan that can blow cool air.Hope this was helpful.Laters."
3,Unnecessary,"don't waste your money on this. you don't need it at all. the only reason your consoles overheats is because you probably put it vertically. if you look at the bottom (talking about it verically) you would see a bunch of holes and that is where the majority of the hot air flows out and when you put the 360 vertically it blocks off this hole. thus letting the 360 overheat and turn off or freeze. so if you just put it horizontally (on its side) the hot air will flow out with ease. i think this product is a waste of money and i would think you do too. ever since i put my 360 on its side, i have had no problems whatsoever. so do this instead of spending money on an unnecessary product."
2,Worked good for 45min,"After that it was dead!! I think it's kind of a short life span... I must admit though, when it did work, it did a good job of reducing the heat.Very disappointed"
5,Worth shellin' out some scratch,"Before purchasing this product I read a lot of customer reviews. The most common complaint was the noise of the fans. Let me tell you that the noise level is GREATLY overrated. Yes, you can hear them, but they aren't THAT loud. They won't interfere with your gaming experience.It is difficult to properly attach the component, though. It took a couple of tries but I found that you can, with a little patience, attach the device along with the wireless adapter.All that aside, despite the noise I can play with a little less trouble on my mind knowing that my investment in this product will lengthen the life of my 360."
4,Cheap Insurance,"Having read all the debate on whether or not this intercooler helps or not, I went ahead and purchased it anyway. My logic was that it's inexpensive enough that I wouldn't be too upset if it didn't do anything. Installation is very easy, and I haven't had any problems with it at all since I started using it (about 5 weeks now). It's definitely a little louder, but I barely notice it. It does seem like my 360 runs cooler now, so as far as I can tell it's doing its job. If you're worried at all about your 360 running hot, or you're into marathon gaming sessions, then I'd personally suggest you pick one of these up. Considering how much you've probably spent on your system and accessories, another few dollars for a fan really doesn't amount to much."
1,YOU WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY,"I got one of these on the recommendation of a friend and it seemed to work pretty well. However, I started talking to OTHER users of it who told me that:- Not only did it cause the Red Ring of Death on their 360s (this was according to Microsoft Repair).- The use of it voided their warranty and they had to PAY to fix their RRoD problem on their 360.I ripped my Intercooler off that night - you should do the same."
2,developed noise problem,"mine hasn't melted the 360 yet as with other folks, but it did develop a horrible noise problem. the 360 is already noisier than it should be. the intercooler adds even more noise (although more like a normal wisper fan would - still it's noticeable). and now, only a couple of months later, it makes a horribly loud sound. can't see how anyone could use the HD-DVD add-on with as noisy as the 360 and intercooler are even when they do work properly.other than that, does it work? i guess. it blows out hot air. does it create more hot air (since it powers from the 360) to blow out as others have suggested? who knows..."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I bought this for 15 bucks at a Gamestop and it was a piece of junk. It worked, for about 2 and 1/2 weeks.. and it was quite noisy.. I tried to take it apart but there was no need. One of the fans broke. Also when you connect it the power cable for the 360 is kinda wobbly in there and its just not safe.Instead of paying 15 bucks for this.. get a fan, quiet but powerful, at a local bargain store."
1,Do not use this product. Period.,"Microsoft will void your warranty if they determine you were using an Intercooler, which is not an approved add-on device. Some machines have characteristic scorching as a dead give-away. I had one, and it developed an annoying vibration, so I stopped using it. Shortly afterward, the reports of problems started coming in. I have at least one friend who lost his box in part due to this product. Look for the Pelican cooling stand instead - it is officially approved for use by MS."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"We bought the intercooler 5 months ago, it was a little noisy but that was ok.We started getting ""the red light death"" last week, we called Xbox and they told us to how to reset the unit and it worked, today the ""red death"" came back on I decided to look at the power terminals, and the intercooler was burnt at the input and the Xbox 360 power supply output was burnt and melted... Nyko has not retuned my phone calls or offered any assistance, and Xbox says sorry but now your warrenty is ""void"" because we dont authorize the use of the NYKO intercooler and Xbox says the NYKO unit is made of inferior materials and the intercooler is a fire hazard and danger please dont use the product...they said the Xbox material for the power input was made to withstand the heat from the power supply. jeez talk about telling me too late especially when we called them last week about the problem and nothing was said to me. STAY AWAY from this product and save yourself a headache and money!!!!!!!!!"
1,First time my 360 overheated...,"...was when I plugged this in. I hadn't had a problem with my Xbox overheating before, though it got hot enough to be a concern, so I bought this ""remarkable"" product. Little did I know that it would cause my system to overheat. I promptly took it back, and I reccomend that no one else has to take it back either."
1,not the seller its the product,"dont ever buy this, if the power chord is shifted at all it turns the xbox into red ring mode so you have to reset it, probly not good for the xbox either"
2,Does NOT fit into my xbox,I cannot give a proper product rating for this because it would not fit my xbox 360 form factor. Maybe it was meant for a slim console or a newer black console. The pictured product suggests tht it is for the original fat consoles but i'm not so sure.
1,Bad,"Do not buy because its badly than better solutions, change the console for garanty, that 2006 not has problem with hot, this adapter overhot de electric conector."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I did notice a HUGE difference in the room temp after installing this device on the Xbox 360. It goes down quite a lot, however... The temperature around the box apparently is screwing with my xbox 360s video cable sensor. I've had the 360 shut down several times due to ""inabillity to detect video cable"" Which is 4 flashing red lights.This error has not occured for me without the cooling unit. I really want to use the device, but whenever the system completely shuts down due to an error that isn't really an error its quite frustrating, especially right in the middle of playing saint's row."
1,Loud and failed i less than a year,"This thing is loud enough that you can hear it being on from the next room. I wouldn't want to watch any content that had quiet parts with this thing in the room. On the plus side the XBox didn't die in the last year with moderate use, but the Nyko didn't last a year. It still looks brand new, without even any dust on it, so it's not exactly a harsh environment. As is typical with small dollar purchases and the high price of gas, it makes as much sense to throw it out as to repair/replace with the same annoying device."
3,May not be needed.,"I ordered this the same time I ordered the xbox 360 arcade (no hard drive) based on info here that indicated that it would be needed. The xbox came first and I ran it for hours on end and the console continued to feel cool, so when the Intercooler came, I never even opened it.Six months later: I have added a 120GB hard drive, so expecting it to add heat, I put the cooler fan on at the same time. I don't know if it really helps, but it is loud enough to be heard over game soundtracks."
1,So lucky it DIDN'T connect...,"I just purchased this product and was excited to see it when it arrived. I must say, it fits perfectly onto the back of the Xbox 360, but that is where the great experience ends. I don't even know if this would have worked on my console because after I plugged it to the back, the power supply cord then would not fit into the intercooler!!! After thinking I just needed a little more elbow grease in trying to snap the two together, I looked at the Xbox power cord and at the connection on the back of the intercooler. I then discovered that the newer Xbox 360's (assumably mine is one of those) have a slightly different power plug that won't fit perfectly into this cooler due to a small piece of plastic. After reading all these reviews and horror experiences, I am so GLAD that my cord wouldn't fit into it!!! THANK YOU! I am happily sending this back to Amazon for a refund :)"
1,Bad Purchase,"I bought this product, and combined with other reviews and my own experience, I'm taking this thing off asap. When you turn your xbox on there is a good chance you will mistakenly think a leaf blower was turned on around you. Combined with this awful noise and the comments of component failure and warranty problems, this product isn't worth a glance."
3,Noisy but effective,"If you use your 360 to play DVD movies, you may wish to look elsewhere for a cooling solution as this thing is so loud it detracts heavily from the movie going experience. It seems to work fine for games though, lots of hot air blows out the back. ;)"
1,Pointless and LOUD!,Installation was EASY! Removal was EASY!Anyone who can't plug it in/out has issues.This thing is FREAKING LOUD! I'm not an audiophile but the constant white noise this thing puts out is annoying. When friends come over and the XBOX goes on everyone is like 'What the heck is that noise?'I've removed the unit and it is now collecting dust because it so LOUD.
4,Works fine for me!!!,"PURCHASED NEW and have used mine since the day after I first turned on my 360 about a year ago. Noisy at first, but the noisy dies off after a few minutes. Never have had a problem with mine and am glad that I purchased this item. MAINTAINING GOOD AIRFLOW AROUND ANY ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IS KEY TO ITS LONGEVITY!!! I can understand if some have had bad experiences with this item, but it if your read into their reviews it appears that it was more Xbox 360 hardware related and/or poor airflow around the 360 than Nyko's intercooler."
5,Excellent insurance for your Xbox 360,"I have had the Intercooler connected to my Xbox 360 for the past month and can honestly say that it does exactly what it claims to do.You can feel the difference this unit makes when you put your hand behind it.It very effectively draws the hot air out of the console and is much more powerful than the stock 360 fans.Yes it does add decibels to the already noisey console but that I can live with and when your in the middle of your favourite game you don't even notice it anyway.I recommend it, if only for some extra peace of mind.Buy it."
2,"Too loud, doesn't do much","I got this thing when I first bought my 360 because of all the crap I heard about the 360 overheating. My first complaint is that the fan noise is even louder than the xbox dvd drive noise (which is pretty loud). Unless you have whatever you're playing/watching turned up pretty loud, this thing will noticably drown some of it out. I ended up taking it off because of this.As for the cooling aspect, I have played many hours both with and without this fan and have noticed no difference whatsoever. I have noticed that the air coming out of the 360 feels cooler, but the system never crashed regardless of whether I had this thing on or not.The only reason I am giving this thing 2 stars is because I would imaging if you WERE having a problem with cooling (like if you lived in a hot climate or had a lemon), then this would probably keep your xbox cooler."
2,item does not match picture,"i had purchased the Xbox 360 Nyko Intercooler but the item i recieved does not match picture on the page. mine doesnt have a switch to turn it on or off. it stays on so i cant play it when my family is sleeping, (due to the fan sound which they are really loud. i dont know where they get the parts from becuase they dont last. after about 30 hours of non-continous use, one of the fans stoped working. i would say be carefull of what you see, and what you get."
2,Enjoy while it lasts,"Well before you purchase yes this item does do what it says, lower my temp and system ran smooth. Well a friend of mine got the same thing after seeing how well mine worked after about a month his system went to freezing up so he took the intercooler off, after that he got the blue screen of death. When it was sent in microsoft said he had voided the warranty from putting the intercooler on and he would have to pay shipping and repairs. It seems that the intercooler causes your system to draw more power than it is supposed to and ends up frying your power supply in the end. So before purchasing I would say you think about taking the risk, I took mine off after i read more reviews on the net that i found by simply searching yahoo for xbox 360 intercooler reviews. Sorry to rain on anyones parade and i hope this gets the information out."
4,xbox 360 nyko intercooler,"This is a cooler for the xbox 360. It is easy to attach and set up. It is alittle noisey when it comes on and gets warmed up, but it moves a good bit of air through the 360. You can feel the amount of heat being pulled through the 360 by these 3 little fans.I have been using this product for a few weeks now with no problems."
3,Works well,"The intercooler screams like a jet engine, but it does keep your 360 at a very cool temperature. I just clips onto the back, easy to install.I'm happy with my purchase just wish it had an ""Airwolf"" whisper mode."
4,Cooler,It's great for my xbox360. When I play it for long hours I don't have to worry about it over heating. The only thing is that when you first get it if you have a new xbox360 you have to take a plastic piece out of it with needle nose pliers or it will not fit.
5,Great Product,"This is a great product, and necessary to keep your Xbox360 cool. The product is engineered well, no modifications needed."
1,Inter-heater,"We purchased this device to ward off the much feared ""red ring of death."" With it attached, we experienced our only hard drive failure and the attendant red ring. Once removed, our 360 returned to it's heretofore seamless performance. Obviously, this device did quite the opposite of its intended purpose - to cool, NOT heat."
1,Please do not BUY!,"This product was not designed by the 360 team, and really most products that aren't aren't very good for your 360.This is no exception, it can and has been known to actually damage, and destroy your 360. A statement from an 360 representative is to not but this product, it has caused numerous problems for a lot of people. Mainly because it actually draws power from the 360, and that's not good, and leads to a lot of other problems."
2,Buyer Beware,"I used to be a big proponent of the Intercooler. After three straight hours of GOW, my 360 would be hot enough to fry an egg on it. At least the Intercooler kept it at a low sizzle. But lately, it's been causing my 360 to act like it's possessed. They tray sometimes wouldn't close when the system was off; occasionally the fan would even stay on. The last straw was when I got the three rings of death. At first I nervously laughed it off and restarted the system. Things were fine till it happened again and then again. I went through the standard troubleshooting checklist, i.e. unplugging the power cord, removing the hard drive, shaking the system up and down, etc. I finally removed the Intercooler and my 360 has been running fine ever since."
1,a pox on this piece of puke,"all xbox owners have to face the truth... the console generates enough heat to warm my house in the winter and there's nothing you can attach to it to cool it off. the heat builds up inside the case and the ventilation is simply inadequate.the only way to keep it truly cool is to either MOD it with water cooling or to open it up and aim a Vornado fan right at it. either way cancels the warranty because you've opened the case, but what's the point of having a warranty if the internals crack from the heat? remember, damage from usage is wear and tear and not covered by the warranty anyway.i simply took the chassis out of the case and use my room fan to power cool air directly onto the chips. works great. and free!btw, i bought this Nyko thing and all it does is make noise."
1,cooler does not work on new xbox,are Xbox had to be replaced after we ordered it and it dose not work
2,DO NOT BUY!,This Device will void your XBox's Warrenty due to the fact that it can cause your xbox to eiter melt because the power supply is not ment to power this product and the xbox or it will cause loose connections within the xbox because of vibration caused by this device. Also it is very loud...
1,It causes the problem it is supposed to solve!!?!!??,"the very first time i used this device, it caused the RROD. i took it back immediately."
1,I'd give 0 stars if I could,"The intercooler can, and in my case did, damage my 360. It sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360, which caused component failure. The worst part? As it's not an approved accessory for the 360, any damage it causes will void your warranty and you'll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket."
1,Proven effective! (at killing your system),"I work at a videogame retailer and I've seen multiple 360s being returned because the Nyko Intercooler melted onto their system. These were under normal conditions.It will fail, it will hurt your system and your warranty will not cover it. Avoid this.If you absolutely must buy a fan for your console, get a ""fan stand"" or ""the cooler"" which use USB for power but stay away from the actual 360 power cord. Otherwise, just give the 360 some space and it'll take care of itself."
1,Killed my 360 aswell : /,"Stay away from this product, my intercooler, while noisy as all hell worked for a good 3 months, but i continously got random red-circles-of-death until my 360 got another one today and couldnt recover. This product will mess up your 360 because of the way the power cord has to go through it first.Terrible product that cost me 140$ and a whole month without my xbox while i wait for it to be repaired."
1,This can damage the 360,This intercooler fan can actually damage the 360. It melts to the console and drains power from it during usage as well. I recommend anyone to avoid purchasing this unit.
1,BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"When you think about it this ""cooler"" is a great item. But the only problem with this ""cooler"" is that it doesn't cool. Yeah the first two seconds were great. The $20 wont break the bank. But if it burns, catches fire, or gets stuck to the back. You wasted $470 (tax included. And it also voids your warranty if it breaks your xbox 360. Now this is a product that is way betteri reccamend this if you are a hard core gamer or a regular layed back gamer. This keeps it cool and is te same price as the inter""cooler"". 19.99 IS THE PRICE. Anything higher go to your locale Circuit City and pick one of these bad boys up!Antec USB-Powered Notebook Cooler"
3,intercooler,it didn't work for about a week and then it began to work. We'll seee how long it lasts...
1,Interheater,"My 360 is still running extremely too hot with or without this thing. You can't even tell if this thing is running. Microsoft needs to make a fan on the hard drive and on the bottom of the system not ""Nyko's fan stand"" that thing is worthless as well. I keep a small fan in front of my system in an enclosed area and it cools it down alot. Or void the warranty and put a hydro-cooling system into it."
1,THIS WILL MELT THE BACK OF YOUR XBOX 360----XBOX KILLER,DO NOT BUY THIS INTERCOOLER ALL IT DID WAS FUSE TO THE BACK OF MY XBOX 360 AND IS A $600 PAPERWEIGHT. I CALLED MICROSOFT AND THEY SAID THIS PRODUCT DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. YOU ARE STUPID IF YOU BUY THIS.
1,"Listen to the other reviews, I didn't","Many people have complained about this melting or burning to the back of their 360. I didn't heed those warnings and decided to purchase the product anyways assuming it must be something they are doing wrong. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. First I keep my system in a well ventilated area but figured the extra fans couldn't hurt right...WRONG...Everything worked fine for a few weeks when all of a sudden the intercooler had some sort of freak out session that sent a puff of smoke into the air and left the plastic melted to the back of my 360. I literally had to get a utility knife to cut the plastic apart to remove the unit. My 360 still works; however, if something were to go wrong with it I don't know if I'd still qualify for the warranty as my case has burn marks which I'm sure Microsoft would consider neglect or abuse. Trust me, stay away from this product."
1,Not compatible with the Elite,"I bought this in a bundle with a battery charger, 4 batteries and a faceplate. It wasn't until X-mas eve, while setting everything up, that I found out that the power supply will not plug into this product. It is a design issue with the intercooler itself, not the 360. Now you know."
1,It melted to my 360!,There's a reason that Microsoft does not recommend or support the use of this product. I purchased my 360 from a friend and it came with the Nyko Intercooler. I used it because I was under the assumption that I had to to prevent the 360 from burning up. The exact opposite ended up being the truth. I played A LOT over the first month. After about two weeks I started receiving the red ring. I decided to take the Intercooler off but couldn't! Finally after much pulling it came off and that's when I noticed it had actually begun to melt/burn where it connected into my 360's power cord. There are now brown burnt marks on both the intercooler and my 360. I have not used the Intercooler since that day and have no longer received the red ring of death. This company needs to be sued. If I had bought this product directly (instead of through a friend) I would be raising some hell with them.
1,Wrecks your 360,"Do not use this product.I had it in and my 360 started randomly making odd noises and giving E-codes on boot-up (not all the time but enough to cause concern). I read some cases on-line where the InterCooler had caused similar types of problems or worse and decided to remove the device.With the cooler off for over a month now, my 360 is running fine with no problems. A few extra degrees of cooling from this product is not worth the risk, and if you're hard-core, there are other alternatives that do not draw current from the 360."
5,You need it!,"If you run your xbox 360 much, or even turn it on, you know it gets very HOT. This Nyko Intercooler, while louder than I would like (it moves a lot of air!), does the job of cooling the xbox down.Microsoft should be ashamed they didn't provide a better cooling system for the platform!I'd just about pay twice the price for this item!"
1,Bad Product,"i bought the intercooler when reports started coming out about the RROD issue. I figured any way of keeping my machine cool was better than having to send it in, right? wrong. it attaches to the 360 shoddily and a power arc between the power outlet on the back of the 360 and the intercooler fused the intercooler to the back of my system. I had to use a hammer and pliers to get the damn thing off. it took a couple of the little plastic thingys that cover the prongs with it. I've also read reports that the intercooler actually CAUSES the RROD issue because it draws too much power away from the system."
4,Nyco intercooler works but with some Caveats,"OK here is the deal, this cooler DEFINITELY moves more air than the stock fans and keeps the 360 MUCH cooler to the touch.That being said, here are the caveats, the cooler MUST be attached firmly in the power socket otherwise one of two things might happen, either you will get red rings because ALL the power pins aren't in contact(make sure IT IS SNUG) OR far more serious you will cause arcing in the power plug and get melted plastic(very bad may permanently damage your 360)also DO NOT buy the original model with the switch, running a 360 with the cooler fans shut off is FAR WORSE than NO cooler at all.Also I don't like the fact that at startup the fans are ""out of balance"" and take a minute or so to get in sync and to quiet down(not sure if this is because they are cheap fans) also if more than one fan in the intercooler fails remove it and get a replacement."
1,Defective XBOX 360 accessory,I purchased this unit in the middle of April - I tried setting this up few times but it did not work - a case of bad luck or GOD knows - i went out of country on Business then vacation so I could not returned it back on time - I got stuck with a NON working XBOX 360 accessory - did they ever QOS this product?
1,never purchase any intercooler,"Thanks to Microsoft, I got my third xbox 360 consol. When second time I had Hardware failure, I asked XBOX support guy, what might be the reason. He said, that xbox technical team found that intercooler actually heating system instead of cooling it.BEAWARE...... Save some green, XBOX works fine without it."
1,piece of junk,not only is it hard to get in to the back of your system correctlyif you forget to turn it on a few times like my bother didto my xbox the cheap plastic it is made of will melt into your systemi just was lucky that i paid the extra money at lunch and got the 2-yearwarranty if you want a cooler get one that is a stand and does not plugin to your system the 360 produces alot of heat and it's plastic is made to stand up to that heat this thing is not.
1,"Kept my 360 cool, till it killed it","Worked great for about a month, my 360 ran cool to the touch compared to running warm before saw temps go down about 10 degrees and stability improved greatly my system locked up alot less. It was terribly loud though. And then after a month of use my 360 died, I blame the nyko and so did MS, thankfully they fixed it for me though"
1,Do not get this. plain and simple,"Do not get this fan. It will burn out your 360 and the warranty will not cover it. If you buy this, you will get screwed. There is a kit that is out made by Pelican. It costs about the same and comes with more stuff. It has all kinds of stuff in the kit including a fan that plugs into the usb port and not the power source. It will not burn out your system and works just the same to keep your 360 cool. Do not buy this NYKO junk fan! REPEAT!!!DO NOT BUY THIS NYKO FAN!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Xbox 360 InterKILLER!!!,"Wow, this product is such a POS. You buy it so that it can extend your xbox 360's life, but what it does is actually damages your xbox 360. This thing kept making my xbox 360 overheat within an hour or two. Eventually I got the red ring of death several times. What this product does is it builds up heat and draws power from the power supply which doesn't give enough juice to the other components. Xbox 360 psu was designed to specifically power the 360 itself, nothing else. Anyways, after removing the Nyko intercooler I played Armored Core 4 for 8 hours and left it on for 24 hours after that. Guess what? No red ring of death. I also touched the xbox 360 every hour to make sure it wasn't as hot as it was with the Nyko Intercooler on. It wasn't hot at all. Seems like stock cooling works just fine. Warning everyone out there, beware of this! I'd go with the pelican stand since MS recommends that compared to this junk. Anyone want a free Nyko Intercooler? haha *smirk*"
1,Don't Purchase,"this thing will burn out your power supply, and leave you Xbox 360-less if you're not careful. I was lucky enough to remove this trash before it did any ""real"" damage.DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!"
4,Great cooler,"I bought this to prevent my xbox360 from overheat. It's great because when I turn of the console and bring the DVD out, the DVD is not hot as it was. Just warm. However, this cooler makes a lot of noise but I don't think that it's that much noise because when xbox360 read DVD game, it usually makes a lot of noise as well."
5,How to understand the basics of a balance sheet,"Edward Fields' Essentials Of Finance And Accounting For Nonfinancial Managers tells how to understand the basics of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and annual reports. Newcomers to reading company financials will appreciate the clear explanations on investment returns, analysis ratios, and other methods of understanding business reports."
4,Excellent Financial/Accounting Resource,"If you are new to finance, budgeting, accounting, and management as I was, this book will help explain key terms in a way that is easy to understand. Some of my fave quotes: ""Accounting is conservative. It requires that the least favorable interpretation of events be presented"", and ""Business is risky and filled with uncertainty. Accounting is risk-averse."""
4,GOOD STORY BUT ----,"Story already covered so these are my comments on -----Joe Redhawk - Native American - seems like a dreamboat but only gets a daughter? And she has problems. Still she is a good girl.Charlie Redhawk - corrupt, abusive - he gets a son! Delightful boy and a credit to his mother.Annie Redhawk -- puts up with a lot -- Don't remember her offering Joe the ranch. Can't have any more children? realistic but not very romantic. Leaves me very dissatisfied for the characters.This is not a put down, just how the story left me feeling! Too much angst! Excellent supporting characters! Still worth reading -- Very, very good --M"
5,Advice on marriage and family from a trusted source,This book is available for free from any one of Jehovah's Witnesses in your local area. The book discusses preparing for marriage and making marriage a success by following biblical counsel. Chapters also delve into parenting (children and adolescents) and caring for elderly parents.
1,Expected More,"With all the reviews on this book I expected more, but I guess BDSM just wasn't my thing or I need more of a ""what to do"" kind of book to show me different ideas to preform, not just how to tie knots."
1,Don't Bother,"Got this book because of the reviews that it was the best. Nope. Don't think so. If you are into dungeons and heavy stuff, okay, but for just a little bit of fun now and then, this is not the book to purchase. Lots of pictures of bondage and heavy flogging instruments. Not your average everyday information on fun diversions."
5,I ALMOST THREW THIS BOOK OUT THE WINDOW OF MY TRUCK!!,"I was so shocked at the photos and drawings in this book that for a few days I actually would pull it out look, and skim through paragraphs and put it away. And I really did almost throw it away. I was shocked to even discover anyone would involve themselves in this kind of activity.But, I RECOMMEND THAT YOU HAVE A SEAT AND READ THIS BOOK! Though I have not become involved in this life/lovestyle as of yet, my interest is strong and I feel prepared to safely explore my curiousity obout BDSM after reading this very informative book.THE SAFETY ADVISE IS WHAT ALL US SHOULD DO IN ANY RELATIONSHIP WE INVOLVE OURSELVES IN! I am also very impressed with the idea of the love, caring, and trust that are a part of true BDSM. The things I am looking for in a relationship.SO, GO AHEAD AND BUY THIS BOOK, READ THE WORDS AND ENJOY! It is an eye opening experience, and one that will enlighten you and just maybe shake your world -- just a little. All for the good!"
4,pretty for beginners,"As a friend of mine asked me for a book to show to her hubby ,for getting him into bdsm ,i told her to buy this book.""Screw the roses ,send me thorns""is a fun to read beginner book.It definatly takes the fear of ""strange kink"" away from any vanilla reader.For me, as profesional Dominatrix it was amusing,but not really helpfull.Nothing new for a advanced or experienced player"
3,"Well written, yet unprofessional looks",A well written book on a very interesting subject. Gives a thorough and somewhat detailed overview of bdsm issues. For experienced and novices alike.The cover of the book doesn't however tell the truth about the graphical / visual quality of the book. Those looking for a beautiful book worth leaving on the coffee table - forget this one.
3,Decent,"This book is decent and tries to give you useful BDSM info, but I would not recommend getting it until you have read more crucial books about the lifestyle. Make sure to buy SM101 before this."
4,I feel confident,"I purchased this book from Amazon.com and found it to be very worth the money. I am a novice with no experience whatsoever, with the intent to encourage my unknowing partener to be my 'dom.' This book includes terminology tips and safety warnings that I found useful to my building know about SM. The one setback is this: it does not say much about how to encourage a man to be dominant, only how to encourage a woman to be your submissive. I am looking for more information about that. Otherwise: a wonderful book."
4,interesting read,"This book is a good view into the real world of bdsm. As a person experimenting ""alone"" and just trying to figure out feelings that are normally considered taboo, this book was a great eye opener. It showed that even some of the strangest urges can be rather common if you know where to look. This book is great for anyone interested in the why of bdsm and how do do it safely. Also the other information that is provided is great. There are lists of how to make your own toys, groups that are into bdsm, and other things that are better to experience when you have a good recommendation into what you are getting into."
4,Works Fine.,I bought this gate nearly a year ago and it works pretty fine till now. I use the pressure mount since i'm a renter and don't want to mess the door frame. I use it to block the kitchen but since my kitchen is open from two sides i'm buying another one because my son just figured out that there's another entrance. The only draw back that i came across that it's not easy to pass over but other than that i'd recommend it.
3,Okay gate,"This gate is decent enough for us to keep, but I am not completely happy with it. The more it is extended, the less secure it feels. It took a little bit for me to get accustomed to unlocking and locking it. Even after I got used to it, it still seems to require a lot of pressure to get it locked into place and tight enough that I feel it is secure. We haven't had any problems with our child getting past the gate, so we have kept it. It is reasonably priced and does work--I just think there are probably more user friendly gates available."
3,Fine simple pressure gate,"I actually think this is a pretty good gate, but my husband hates it, so I averaged it out. It is excellent if all you are looking for is a sturdy, inexpensive pressure gate. It is a hassle to move and replace, so I just swing my legs over it, but my husband refuses to do this and moves it every time, following it up with a good twenty seconds of strongly-worded complaints. If you mount it to the wall, you supposedly can swing it like a door, but that wouldn't work well in this doorway so we haven't tried it. If we move, we will be getting the kind that has an inner swing gate for the kitchen and use this in a less used doorway."
2,toddlers crash right through,"This gate is a real piece of junk. (I have 3 of these things- bought at the same time b.c they were cheap.) It tore the paint off the sides of my wall, it marks the parts of the wall where the paint actually remains, my son bursts through it with minimal effort, the handle is really difficult to operate... If your door frame is the slightest bit uneven or off in any way, the pressure thing is totally useless. We are constantly tripping over it b/c the pressure points don't stay pressed to the wall. It just doesn't work well. I have never used it as a wall mounted gate though so maybe that works better. (I have lived in apartments for a while and need to use the pressure mounts so as not to drill in the wall.) Long story short, I don't recommend this gate."
2,Doesn't work as advertised.,"Firstly, they call it a pressure-mounted gate, but fail to inform you that if you need to use it as a true ""gate"", you need to hardware mount it. Otherwise it is a pressure-mounted barrier, not a gate. You need to hurdle it or pull it out to pass.Secondly, the mechanism was awkward. It kept sticking. Neither my wife nor I could easily slide the two panels.We returned this and bought the more expensive, but infinitely more usable First Years Hands-Free gate."
2,Works ok...,We have this using the pressure-mounted setting. It does stick and then it's really hard to work. I have two of them and wish I'd paid a bit more to buy ones that work better. My husband hates it and is insisting we buy another one... that works better.
2,"hard to use, quit working","I never really liked this gate because it is somewhat hard to use. I bought another one because I needed two gates and this one was the only one available.The first one that I bought no longer works. The handle used to open and adjust it will not lift.I have the new one pressure mounted at the bottom of the stairs and it works ok for this. My banister post is round and tapered so it is smaller at the top. The pressure mounts on this gate adjust a little to fit, so it is working as a temporary fix.It would work fine for a plain pressure mount, but it is hard to step over."
1,terrified!!!!!! Extremely dangerous!!!!!!!!,"I have a very active 1 year old, I got this gate and put at the bottom of the stairs, I was happy thinking my son wouldn't go up the stairs so I turned my head for two minutes, and when I turned around my son was on top of the gate standing on the middle bar with his head almost on the other side, about to cross to the other side!!!!! thank God it was sturdy!! if not my son would have had a terrible fall!!!!!! I got so scared I returned it immediatly for me it was extremely dangerous!!! DO NOT GET IT IF YOUR CHILD IS ACTIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,NOT a pressure mountable gate!,"This item is listed as a pressure mountable gate, but it is not. It is only a gate if you hardware mount it. Using it as a pressure mounted devise it is simply a removable wall, which is not very easy to use with one hand. I'm returning the item today."
1,Hard to use,"As mentioned in other reviews, this gate is not very user-friendly. I have only used the pressure mount option as I am a renter, the handle does not life up easily, the two panels are very difficult to slide, and once you have it mounted, you better leave it alone. We've had ours for less than a week, it's already bending somewhat from one side to the other. It is extremely inconvenient to step over especailly when you are carrying a baby. I would recommend going with a more expensive unit and stay away from this one."
2,non user friendly...gathering dust,"I bought this gate for four reasons: it looked sturdy, it looked portable, easy to use, plus the price was right ($20 at Target). Well, it is portable, and was reasonably priced...but that's it. Since I can't find the receipt...it's now in my basement waiting to be donated. My husband doesn't mind it as much as I do, but it's just awkward, hard to use, not sturdy and even has some sharp plastic edges kids could cut their hands on. Also, my kids have already knocked it down (my husband said I didn't have it put in properly), but if I didn't, it's just too much of a pain to have to deal with when used as a pressure gate. The good old fashioned wood gate is better in that regard. That's what I'm using now. One other note, it's acutally not very tall so if your kid is taller than about 34"" they might be able to climb over it."
5,CD - Time by ELO,Brings back fond memories of the concert I attended in 1981 in Philadelphia. Great concert; great music. One of my favorite musical groups.
5,Far Ahead Of Its Time,"I have listened to this album regularly for many years. It is among the best albums by one of rocks greatest bands. Their music is in a select class of rock including Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Pink Floyd, that will always stand the test of time. ""Time"" does just that."
5,One of the Best Albums ever made!,"This was my first ELO album, bought in 95' I listened to it at a CD store, trying to find some new decent music. From the first listen I was blown away. I'm not too crazy about all the old tunes.. Evil Woman, Showdown, etc. This album is very ahead of it's time. The production is crazily great, from huge drums to echos in the background.. great writing and imagary. Just buy it."
4,ELO finest '80s release,"I always liked Secret Messages, Time, and Balance of Power. Time is probably the best of the 3 combining the latest in production technology and fantastic melodies. Why this band has not been inducted into the R'n'R Hall of Fame is unknown."
5,Excellent!!,"This CD is just fantastic! It is by all measures a concept albumwhich ironically came after the pop fluff of ZANADU. It is a statement of Jeff Lynn's talent and vision. It is NOT a pop singles CD. Truly great, it easliy stands with Moody Blues or Beatles concept work and hopefully in 'TIME' will take it's place for recognition."
3,Not the best sound but good to own,"I have been looking for this cd for ages and when I saw one in a stand in a supermarket I couldn't afford it. Wouldn't you know? When I went back a week later the stand was gone!So anyway it's great to hear this fantastic album on cd at last. just wonder why ELO's catalogue sounds so bad....I mean it was the late 70's but some of the masters sound like they were made on a cheap cassette, even after remastering!!"
5,We Can Choose a Family,"Nancy Atherton's AUNT DIMITY AND THE NEXT OF KIN has the underlying theme of we can't choose our family, but we can choose our friends. Lori is at loose ends, she volunteers at a nursing home and meets Miss Elizabeth Beecham. They quickly become friends, but Ms. Beecham dies leaving Lori a desk.Investigating, Lori discovers that one-by-one the most important people in Ms. Beecham life disappear leaving her alone on a pier. The pier is a symbol of the start of a journey in developing friendships.A soft cozy that is delightfully written and the raisin bread is good too.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
2,Not up to par,"I am a huge Aunt Dimity fan - I have read all the books. This one was a disappointment. The ""mystery"" was barely a mystery at all, with a very anticlimactic and unfulfilling ending. Plus Lori, who started off in the series so quirky and likeable, has turned into a preachy goody-two-shoes. Atherton tries hard to make Lori seem like a regular ol' down-to-earth mom in spite of the fact that she's rich and spends her time volunteering for a million projects, but it doesn't work. Nancy Atherton: please give us a meaty mystery and show Lori as a loveable goofball again!"
3,"Classy, modern but not too bright.","This is a very eye-appealing fixture which was easy to put together and install. Wiring was simple. The light adds a nice modern touch to the bathroom and we installed a dimmer switch for the fixture. When dimmed, the fixture gives a beautiful soft light which is nice and doesn't blind you in the middle of the night.My only complaint is that the bulbs are 35watt and, when the dimmer switch is on high, it doesn't brighten up the bathroom (the room is small (about 6' x 8'). My husband complained he had a hard time seeing when shaving and he was standing (obviously) right under the fixture looking in the mirror underneath. We are going to buy 40w bulbs in hopes it makes it a little better so he doesn't miss any more spots when he shaves (lol)."
3,Good product with a but,"The light is stylish and of good quality. Mine might have been damage in shipping, though. Everything got here in one piece but one of the shades was a tight fit and cracked a couple of weeks after mounting. Anyone know where I can get a shade for this lamp. Other than that it is a good product and I recoment it."
2,"Pretty, but not practical, and poorly packaged for shipment","This fixture is attractive, but from a functional standpoint is poorly designed, and the packaging for shipment is poor. The first one arrived with one of the glass covers broken. Amazon (with its excellent customer service) promptly sent a replacement. Only after the light was installed did I notice that it throws its light upward and outward, but not downward like you would expect from a bathroom vanity light. The bottom of the fixture has semicircular metal pieces with very small holes (pinholes almost) that sit under the bulbs and block the light from projecting downward. Because of the way the glass shades fit in the fixture, it is not reversible (they would fall out if installed in reverse). The result is that a light over the mirror does a very poor job of illuminating your face (which seems to be the whole point of having a light over the mirror). I would not recommend this fixture."
2,Very cheap,"Not at all worth the money. It does't put out much light and the metal housing is very thin giving it that ""cheap"" look.Also, after it's been up less than a week, the middle light comes on/goes off when it's in the mood. Three lights don't provide enough lighting for even the most mindless task so TWO lights? Forget about it.I've already written this off as a loss. I'm thinking about painting the cheap housing with a textured metal paint to make it look a little nicer. Can't hurt...."
5,The Perfect Gift: Vivaldi's Viola Compositions by Bruno Cocset,"According to musician and artist John Farlow who recently purchased a viola da gamba, this CD is a classic recording by supremely talented musician, Bruno Cocset. I presented John with the CD for Christmas, and he thanks me every time he sees me. He LOVES the recording."
5,Good advice to plan and overcome a surely trying period,"It's always scary changing jobs or careers. I'm a Naval Officer with some very solid management experience. I'm leaving military service for a private sector job and I was extremely impressed with the systematic and thourough preparation this book gives you. It was definitely a ""glad I read"" it book!"
3,Interesting,Some very interesting ideas. The relationship between Joseph's economic policies and the later enslavement of the Israelites was great food for thought.
5,Leading the Passover Journey,"This is the best book on the Passover Seder feast and all its symbolic meanings that I have ever seen. Author Rabbi Nathan Laufer finds the scriptural and historic roots to the foods and items on the Seder plate. His insights are genious, and very enlightening!"
4,Knape & Vogt plastic slide track,"I was surprised to find these, as I thought the item was out of production. The previous owner owner of my boat had upgraded the galley shelves with sliding teak panels 15 years ago, but age and cabin temps. had caused them to become brittle and they began to break up. Happy to report they were easy to cut and glue into place and the sliding panels look and operate beautifully."
5,Just what i needed...,I needed this for my custom bearded dragon cage. I wanted sliding doors on the cage and purchased these to accomplish this. They are very hard to find locally so I looked on good old Amazon and there it was. Couldn't be happier. They do come with directions on how to cut your glass or Plexi to fit the tracks...
5,Love it!,"I used this for a music video and it looks great. I can't speak about quality because I own a different mic to record, but if you're looking to capture visuals, this mic is excellent!"
4,"Nice iPod Speakers - Makes a small ""hum""","I've enjoyed the iPod speakers. It came with different adapters to plug in various iPod types and it fit the ones we had. It also came with a cord to plug into the headphone jack of other mp3 players that aren't compatible with the iPod dock.The sound is great and the volume is loud enough.The only problem is that when the music is not playing and the device is left on, we can hear a little ""hum"" that is annoying enough to catch our attention and go over and unplug the speakers from the power source.Other than that, it's been a great product."
5,WOW,"This is the first SB4 CD that I own and all I can say is WOW!!! Ever since I bought it I haven't turned it off. This is by far my favorite CD in my collection and seems poised to stay there, at least until I can get my hands on ALL their previous releases!Salsa Hits is full of wonderfully written and beautifully performed songs that either make you want to get up and dance or sing out loud. GREAT JOB GUYS!!!"
3,hurt back,I did the workout and had back pain for the next day. I think that this stretchy band if not used exactly right can harm the lower back. I would discourage purchasing this product and opt for the workout with the ball. Much better.
4,Borom Sarret- A day in the life of a village donkey cart driver,"Note: This review only covers ""Borom Sarret"". Ousmane Sembene creates a sympathetic character who is down on his luck in post-Colonial Senegal. The donkey-cart driver simply wants to earn enough money to feed his family at the end of the day but customers who are too poor to pay him and parasitic foreigners and their colonial collaborators cause him to lose his cart and all his money over the course of a day. Even the little he has left, his pride in his heritage and ancestors, cause him nothing but financial ruination. The donkey cart driver himself speaks in the voice over narration with a dripping cynicism about the current state of Senegal and the effect modernization has had on the country and its people. The ending is left open to interpretation. Overall this is a realistic and cynical portrait of Senegal just after colonization and should not be missed."
5,A Must See!!,"A wonderful look at Senegal, racism, and colonization, done through symbolism and language.Everyone should see this film!"
3,Pure image quality,"The delivery was as announced when I placed the order.The only thing I did not like is the pure quality of the video.I understand that the two movies are old ones, they date back to the 60's.But I would expect some workout to restore the quality of the original versions."
2,Errors abound,"After reading just 3 chapters of this text, I was forced to put it to rest. The number of errors, particularly in the examples, were frustrating and confusing. I am an IT professional. My company would never accept work that wasn't as error-free as possible. Obviously, the editors are not placed under similar expectations."
2,Too many errors!,"I can't believe this was the required textbook for my ""Introduction to Oracle"" class. Luckily I had taken an earlier class that covered the basics of SQL, because this book has so many errors in the examples that it can be very confusing. I'm very disappointed in the quality of the proof-reading of this text."
4,SQL from the GROUND UP,This book starts from scratch(from the ground up) and takes you to creating useful products. Uses tables(and data)from the free Oracle sample database(which was an education in itself loading on my machine using Oracle's documentation!) also has downloadable examples from Osborne Press and Microsoft.
1,"Bad examples, very confusing and unclear","This bought sounds looks like it has a lot to offer, but once I got into it I discovered that there is no real substance at all. She works thru some examples, but never tells you what the tables look like or how to populate them! It's near impossible to follow the examples, and the book is full of typos. There's better stuff out there."
2,Needs a lot of work!,"This book looked rather comprehensive when I flipped through it in the bookstore, but I was unpleasantly surprised to discover how much it lacked when I tried to use it at work the next day. None of the items I looked up were covered in any reasonable amount of detail, and many items weren't covered at all. For example, I found nothing regarding how to insert data from one table into another table! I had to borrow a co-workers book instead. This book is going back to the store today!"
3,"Good, but lots of typos","This book is good for someone new. However, there are several typos in the book that may make you go crazy if you don't realize they are just typos."
3,Uhhhhhh,Just too difficult (even for me) for the 6 to 10 year olds I thought otmake book covers with. You must really just want to get into this.
3,Bird X pro,"Product does work. Except I bought two and one did not function at all, so had to returm for a refund. glad i bought two."
1,Bird-X worthless,Wasted good money on this device. Woodpeckers drilling holes 5 feet fromit as it blasts away. Bothers nothing except my neighbors.
4,saving souls,"I putchased this item as a tool to winning souls to Christ, I pray that the books with enter into whoever reads them and it will bring them into our Family."
4,Outstanding Book,"Excellent book. This is a must read for every violinist. However, as much as I admire his discussion of finger patterns I think that his nomenclature for the patterns is problematic and there are many very useful patterns that he does not describe."
2,"Listen to the Britten only, please","Unfortunately I purchased the CD for the recording of the Walton, looking forward to what an artist of Vengerov's calibre could do with the piece. Unfortunately what he managed to do was mangle it. The tempos are dreadfully (actually painfully) slow and he forces too much to get a large sound from the viola. Vengerov's foray into viola territory was a nice experiment, but not one that he should repeat. The Britten is up to his usual standards."
5,Britten flawed?????,"Britten's Violin Voncerto is spellbinding. Hypnotic. For one of the reviewers to call it ""flawed"" means he must go to Suffolk, sit on the shingle beach, listen to the seagulls on a grey cold day. This is one of Britten's most awe-inspiring works. The last pages would bring tears to your eyes. Walton, a 2nd rate wife-beater doesn't even bear comparison. One of, if not the greatest violin concertos of the 20th Century. Vengerov is superb in his reading, and only challenged by Nadia Grumlikova, a recording to die for. Avoid Ida Haendel's ghastly scraping like the plague. But don't die without listening to this stupendous concerto."
3,Okay recording of Walton,"Vengerov plays the viola concerto pretty well, although it is a little too slow for my taste. Of all recordings of the Walton Viola Concerto, Paul Neubauer's is by far the best. He has a superb sense of musicality and style for the piece. His bow control is something to strive for."
4,Good beginner's book about astronauts,My 3 year old son loves this book. The words are easy for him to understand and the pictures are great. We read it again and again.
2,A few nice ideas but too long,"Asking questions is an important skill and this book contains some useful ideas and techniques. However, it would benefit from some serious editing as it is far too long and is badly arranged. About 150 pages less would be about right."
2,"High hopes, but disappointed","I have always been a strong advocate for intelligent questioning, so was excited to see a book devoted to this topic. There were definitely some good points, but overall, I felt like I do after seeing a long movie I was anticipating to be wonderful, but turns out to be a waste of my time...I want my money back!"
4,Gillian Welch - Revival,"Sweet, Soulful folky Style. Beatiful songs. Mostly acoustic guitar. Love it! jp"
4,A pure voice,"Gillian Welch has such a pure voice, and most of the music in this album is simple and clean to match. The Paper Wings song I dislike intensely - the music is horrible and it sticks out like dogs balls from the rest of the songs. I like hearing that slidey noise when the guitar is changing chords, it's like listening live."
2,a little too country,this wasn't really what i expected. i bought it for 'paper wings' and was really disappointed that the rest of the cd didn't seem to follow that same style of music
5,Clarity,"One could question the ""authenticity"" of a couple living in Los Angeles who make music that sound like pure appalachia (post-elvis). Truth is, I never get tired of this record. T-Bone Burnette is an amazing producer, and it's no accident that this record has a clear direct vision.No fluffy instrumentation, no cornball lyrical flourishes. This record is a clear and direct artistic statement, and as such, is nearly perfect.Not for everyone, I'm sure, but if you appreciate good songwriting, and a no b.s. approach, give this one a try.Possibly on my all time top ten!"
5,You MUST buy this CD,"I had my computer on Spinner.com and I heard this voice, and checked and it was Gillian Welch. I had never heard of her, but immediately jumped to amazon.com and ordered the CD. It arrived about a week ago and I can't stop listening to it. All originals by Welch and her partner David Rawlings, it is one of the best CD's I have bought in years. The music is so sweet and rich it makes me want to cry every time I put it on."
5,Very impressive!,"I happened to listen to this cd when I visited a CD-shop in Amsterdam. I was impressed. During my vacations in the USA I visited her concert twice, in Annapolis (md) and Hickory (nc). I consider Revival as the CD of 1995, 1996 and 1997!."
5,Splendid,"This is truly a ""splendid"" CD, I had not heard of Gillian Welch until Amazon reccomended it several times. I finally listened to the sample tracts and really liked her voice. This is a great addition to anyones music collection,especially if you are a folk song lover.This is one of those cd's where you really will like all the songs, money well spent.My favorites were Barroom Girls and Only One and Only.Give yourself a treat and let this one be your first Gillian Welch CD...it won't be your last."
5,Never get tired of hearing it......,"I first stumbled across Gillian Welch and David Rawlings late at night on ""Sessions at W57th"" and immediately was entranced. I had to go out and get the CD, something I usually never do. The acoustic guitar work is heavenly, the simple harmonies are addictive; I love to sing along and harmonize. I have had this CD for years and never get tired of hearing it!"
4,Unexpected,"Not really what I was expecting with a title like ""Revival"", but then again, who expects upbeat from Gillian Welch? Several gems. Worth every penny."
5,old time music with an attitude,"I bought this cd with some trepidation. I'm a serious fan of old time music and traditional bluegrass, and I was afraid most of the tracks on this cd would be singer-song-writerish. But although all the songs are originals, almost all are great. And I have to admit, these two Californians--Gillian Welch and David Rawlins--have those mountain-style harmonies down cold. It's also nice to see them get some recognition with the release of the O Brother soundtrack. I also hear there's a documentary in the works of a concert they and other artists from the soundtrack gave at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, and I believe a companion cd as well. I can't wait for their new release at the end of July."
5,"I went out on a limb with this selection, and I love it.","I usually get burned when I purchase a CD without first listening to a few cuts. Not so with this CD. There's not a bad cut on the entire CD. This is the sort of Country Music I long for, modern but reverently traditional. No flashpots, no bare bellies, no lingerie passing for clothes. Just home-style music so pure you could sneak it into the local Bluegrass radio program."
1,heath zenith is junk,Heath Zenith products are JUNK! I have purchased their motion detector floodlights that do not even come on when I drive my car right under them!Real crap.
2,Zenith SL-5412,This fixture does not accommodate compact fluorescent flood light bulbs without removing the shades!!! These bulbs are wider above the screw threads than normal flood bulbs and this section does not fit through the opening in the shade making it unable to reach the socket threads. You have to remove the shades if you want to use compact fluorescents.
3,Stopped working after 1 year,"I bought two of these and they worked well enough when new (although I think the range is a bit less than stated) but after about a year one of them stopped working. It seems to still 'detect' as the LEDs flash, but the lights never come on (and no, it isn't the bulbs). Just replaced it with another Heath/Zenith, model 5326, hopefully I won't regret it."
1,Worst product I've ever purchased,"Installed my first Heath Zenith motion light and after a couple of months it wouldn't shut off - I thought I had a bad unit so I returned it and got a new replacement. This one didn't even make it one month before it failed (wouldn't shut off). This ""made in China"" product means you're going to be up and down a ladder frequently to install, remove, reinstall, remove, etc...."
1,Wanted to give it a zero,"Have now had three of these fail. They're junk. What good is a warranty when they can't even send you back the same color light. Sent them a white one, and they send back brown!First two were halogen purchased at Home Depot. Home Depot didn't even have the right replacement bulb."
1,Not worth it!,Junk!!I purchased 2 of these. The first one worked for about six months.I thought maybe I just got a bad one.I replaced it and the second one only lasted 3 months!!
4,Grace Towns Hamilton and the Politics of Southern Change,"The book is full of good Atlanta history prior to the 60's., that really shows Ms Hamilton's importance. I regret the authors did not include more direct quotes from her. At the time the book was written, her health had not declined due to illness or age. Wish they had taped some interviews,and found a way to incorporate more of her reflections on the events.Book arrived in excellent condition,"
4,informational book!,This is a wonderful biography on one of Georgia's greatest legacies. If you are interested in the life of Grace Towns Hamilton this is a must read
3,no surprise,"Although it is not the Warren Commission party line, it is still a very close version. Curry appears to make a statement that he is his own man and acknowledges that things may not be as they appear that is about it."
5,THE OTHER SESSIONS - ESSENTIAL COUNTRY !,"I bought this album in June this year - after a few listens I thought ""this guy sure writes and sounds different, but he's pretty good"" - after a few more listens I thought ""this guy not only writes well, but the way he sings is really starting to grow on me too"" - after a few more listens I thought ""this guy is one of THE BEST songwriters around and I LOVE the way he sings!"" I'm still listening and Jim Lauderdale is now in my favorite artist list along with the likes of Dwight Yoakam,Buddy Miller,Rodney Crowell,etc.'The Other Sessions' is essential REAL COUNTRY for 2001!"
3,Merle World,"As he seems to do from time to time, Laurderdale loaded up a bunch of co-writers, and set out to write hisself a straight country album (as opposed to his bluegrass efforts). The result is pretty mixed. It's an enjoyable album - most of the songs are pretty good. But it doesn't seem to have that subtle Lauderdale tang. The slow songs come across as sappy rather than heartfelt, and the faster ones are a bit formulaic.Lauderdale seems to have immersed himself a little too far in ""Merle World"", and lost his own unique touch. We've still got Merle! Admittedly, Merle himself is pretty uneven, but no one can match him at his best. So don't try - no one can match Jim Lauderdale at his best either. Sadly, this is not his best - it's his ""pretty good"". ""You'll know when it's right"", and this just isn't.Overall, adequate, and listenable, but I don't look to Lauderdale for classic country cloning - even if it is good quality."
4,One potential hit after another,"It's amazing these songs aren't on the radio. Cover versions by more well-known country artists (and Lauderdale is a fine performer in his on right) would be very welcome on what passes for country radio lately. Please, would members of the particular female demographic the programmers target please buy this CD? Thank you. :-)"
3,camping for boys,it was a nice read as it took me back in time when i was a boy. i would recommend it for any one wanting to experience a good ole campout.
4,A standout novel,"I read this a while ago, but remember it being a refreshing and intelligent story that included issues not normally seen in contemporary fiction. The characters seemed very real and the information is thought-provoking. If you're looking for something different, that takes you to a higher level, Fate's Redemption is an excellent and highly recommended choice."
5,KEITH AT HIS BEST.,"I finally read Fate's Redemption. Oh My Gosh What A Book. This is a book that once you start it you can't put it down. Although this book was written 5 years ago it is still very much on target today. This book has made me give serious thought & truly analyze my true attitude on the subject of black men with whie woman. Keith takes this subject & presents it in such a honest & thought provoking way. While at the same time,Fate's Redemption give us romance,sex,action in an excellent plot. I could go on & on but I will end by say You will Love it. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK."
4,Intellectually Stimulating!!!!!,"The Urban Page Turners reading group chose this novel as our FIRST for discussion. We found the novel to be both descriptive in background and setting, and respectful in character development. Although we were divided in whether or not ""Fate's Redemption"" was fluffy in regard to the introduction of unnecessary characters, we agree that it is a wonderful novel to discuss as it touches serious topics concerning race and interracial relationships. All and all, The Urban Page Turners, definitely considered this novel as a page turner!!!"
4,Lessons,"The things that I thought I knew I really didn't know. Will is phenominal in this book. He addressed issues that we have been talking about amongst ourselves and have been too scared to talk about outloud. For a while I forgot that I was actually reading a 551 page novel and not a modern day history book.Keith's main character is Will, a pyschologist, falls for none other than a white woman. She is not the typical white woman. oops he teaches us in this book that our choice of words and theories can play a big part in our lives in the future. Their lives are full of comments and troubles not only from the outside world but Will and Terry's family as well. Can these two fight off the cruelty of people to keep their relationship afloat?"
2,Maybe a bit premature (Boring),"I have not finished reading this book but am half way through, so my review may be a bit premature. Thus far, this book has not done it for me. I've read three of Mr. Johnson's books, Pretenses which was EXCELLENT!, Suger&Spice, just didn't get it and the Honeymoon is over, which was great as well. I'm not sure what Mr. Johnson was thinking when he wrote this book, it's too long, there really is no story line and it just seems like he's saying a lot of nothing. I guess i'll have to finish the book to see if i'm in fact premature in my critique of BORING!!"
4,Better than Lego . . . Almost.,"So far I like the game a little bit. My reservations may come from the fact that I have trouble with turn based strategy games (where is my bum rush?) or from the fact that this genre at some point can feel like a job as opposed to a game. But this game has the feature to end all features, the shipyard! It is like have legos and building spaceships all over again. This strategy really sparkles when you build the ships to your design and send them out. The design has little impact, but gives your race a feel of it's own. Noticed a bug so far where I can't load save games (ouch) but hopefully there will be a patch soon.The game is very similar to the civilization series, but has a flavor and humor all it's own. If you like the civ series you will like this for the same reasons. If you didn't like civ, then you should not pick this one up."
1,Warning: You Can't Patch Without Registering,"Beware. If you spend you hard-earned money for this game, you cannot patch it without giving out your personal information. And also typing in an incredibly long number (which is all run together in a small font) without making any mistakes. And the game needs patching.Stardock has a long history of no respect for privacy, and for going to ridiculous lengths to make sure you were as inconvenienced as possible after buying their games. They've really gone overboard this time, and the game is going back immediately."
2,I want my money back!,"DON'T BUY THIS GAME. Whoever said that this was a worthy successor to Masters of Orion II should be killed. This game is awful! You don't get to DO anything. Neither the fleet combats nor the ground combats are interactive--all you get to do is watch. The micromanagement gets old if you have more than a few planets and the technology-tree is difficult to use. Considering how little you get to do, you might as well go watch T.V. instead. This game is garbage. I wish I could get my money back."
3,so so game,"This game is certainly updated with better AI, graphics and such. Unfortunately it moves like a snail and over time is kinda boring. I lost interest after a few hours. It doesn't hold the same entertainment value as the new RTS games. I wouldn't buy this game new"
4,I Preferred MOO:3,"Don't get me wrong; this is a fine game, worth the price. However, I'm the kind of weirdo that LIKED the mystifying complexity of Master of Orion 3; GCIV2 is a bit to simple and straightforward for me, a little like a ""spreadsheet game"". In MOO3, the player gets to control friendly forces in tactical battles on ground and in space; in GCIV2, one simply watches them happen. Never mind the fact that this is more realistic: given the distances involved, battlefield commanders would enjoy great freedom of action in this context. But I play Turn-Based Strategy games to indulge my inner control freak (strange, considering that my persona is pretty laid-back and messy). Still, a good game, and if you were overwhelmed by MOO:3's byzantine sophistication (or appearance thereof), this is the answer to your wishes."
1,Spyware warning,"All other things being ignored, Stardock still has not learned from its first releases. My objection to this game and manufacturer relates to the fact that in order to get patches, updates, and expanded content, you MUST register and download software from the manufacturer. This software was identified as spyware by all 3 spyware programs I have running. The 2 spyware programs that identify 'threat levels' gave it the highest threat rating possible. The company claims that it is not spyware, but if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...It is up to the individual consumer to make the choice whether they want to trust this manufacturer to install potential spyware on their system. However, I feel it is important that consumers are aware of this before they make the purchase. Since this game CLEARLY needs patching based on the sad state of its release, unless you're willing to take the spyware risk, steer clear of this title and manufacturer."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this expecting an imaginative fictional version of the Civilization series. This game does not live up to any Civilization title in depth or playability. The races are functionally indistinguishable from one another except by colors, and the technology tree is woefully shallow and limited. I would not reccommend this game to anyone."
3,tired and repackaged,"This game is nothing more than Gal Civ I repackaged with (slightly) better graphic. It plays basically the same - you don't need the tutorials at all. If you played the first game you can play this right out of the box. It was a big disappointment. After four days of having the game, its now just click, click, *Yawn*, click, click, *Yawn*, click..."
4,A great game for Master of Orion II fans,"Basically MOOII was one of my favorite all time games and I was dying for MOOIII to come out. I was even posting on the forums at the time it was being developed, the developers would come on and say all these great things about MOOIII and basically they were completely full of it. Never saw a worse, more disappointing game than MOOIII. But the good news is that its like literally the good part of the development team got away at some point and made Galactic Civ 2. Basically same strategy components but better graphics and more fun. So have at it old school Master of Orion playas!"
3,"Wonderful, but no multiplayer","Gal civ 2 is one of the greatest strategy games ever, sadly there is NO MULTIPLAYER WHATSOEVER! This means that sooner or later you get bored not fighting acutal people, but creating ships and ruling an empire is great fun!"
3,worth a try,Strategy element is nice but there is really no tactical control - there is no real control over the battles and that is what is missing most from this game.
3,"Good game, but doesn't take enough risks.","Like a lot of you, I really liked master of orion 2. Not only did a lot of cool elements come together, it had a kind of goofy charm with characters, artwork and whatnot.Then came gal civ and gal civ 2. Better graphics, some small tweaks, but basically the same song and dance.Remember the glut of RTS games that came out in the 90's? Gather resources, build, create army, fight. Some were better than others, but weren't they all just variations on a theme? How about first person shooters?Gal civ 2 is a good species of a game archetype, but not particularly exciting or different compared to moo2. I also find the atmosphere a bit sterile. There's no ""oomph"" to it, for lack of a better word. Very sedate.Again, not a bad game at all, just a tad ho hum."
5,Galactic Civilizations,I bought the first galactic civ when it came out. The second was even better. You can make custom ships and reaserch new technologies and there are even more races to choose from. I like these game for replay value. Not the same boring thing. In the first I go into the xml and add new stuff such as technology and new stats and so on. It is too easy. Both galactic civ one and 2 are a safe bet for a fun stratagy game.
2,Buggy Mess,"This game crashes to desktop an amazing amount of times. The technology tree was large and interesting (ala MOO2) enough I decided to play through the crashes. I could not however, play through the horrid bugs and exploits that allowed you to win at the higher levels of difficulty. The worst example is building galactic privateers, which protects your freighters from attack...the enemy fleets chase around after your invulnerable freighters and after some trigger (I didn't bother to try and find out) your home planets (and the enemies) become invulnerable to attack by troop transports. With your worlds invulnerable, you cruise to a tech victory. Long story short: game uninstalled, disk thrown away."
5,Excellent Garbage Disposal,"This garbage disposal is priced well, quiet and does the job. However, if you are hooking it up yourself and you are connecting it to a dishwasher, make sure you take out the plug in the dishwasher connect, otherwise your dishwasher won't be able to drain. :)"
4,GREAT REPLACEMENT,"This unit was slightly smaller than our original, but just as powerful and actually gave us a little more room under the sink. Very easy to install: good directions. Very good value for the money"
3,5 Year Life?,"Installed this to replace an old Insinkerator. I bought it for it being more compact which gave more space under the sink. It worked as designed but it is more noisy than the old model. The inner blades finally rusted in place after two months of disuse. As I recall it was easy to install, but my expectation would have been a useful life beyond 5 years. The warranty is only 2 years, so the only option is to buy another one...."
4,good one,"I received this item on time, it works good, I replaced old 1/3HP whirlway with whirlway 291 1/2 HP. resonable price when compared to local stores"
1,No power cord!!,Be warned!! This product DOES NOT come with a power cord. The instructions mention that some units come without power cords. It sure would have been nice if somewhere in the description of this item it would have mentioned that fact.
2,Works for a while,This disposal was installed by the builder of our house probably because it is one of the cheapest available. I guess I'm lucky that it did last 5 years as it is very cheaply made.
5,All her recorrds are five star!,"The best cuts on this one are ""Field Behind the Plough"" and the two closing numbers; they perfectly convey the texture of her warmly expressive voice, which is always, and completely, put into the service of whichever song she is singing. The only other singers whose voices I feel this way about are Judy Collins, Harry Belafonte, and Fred Astaire - all of whom, like Priscilla, can do no wrong musically - and Ian & Sylvia (who are, um, two voices perfectly combined).I wrote this review because this is the only one of her records here at Amazon that had no stars...an oversight I'm happy to redress."
3,Not very memorable.,"Sarah Chang gives an uninspired performance here. I agree with others that the tempo is very sluggish and most noticed in the last movement. The interpretation is dull and forgettable. It's a shame because I know Chang is capable of so much more. If you want an incredible recording, take look at Akiko Suwanai's rendition of the same concerto."
1,HORRIBLE RECORDING TECHNIQUE!,This recording was a huge disappointment to me because Ms Chang sounds as if she is played from somewhere out in the alley while the microphone (such as it is) was inside in the midst of the orchestra. I can't comment on the Ms Chang's performance (I'm sure it was well done) because it's next to impossible to hear her over the orchestra. The artists should be ashamed to have their names affiliated with a shabby product like this. Note to EMI: hire some recording engineers!
3,Disappointed,"After reading a glowing review, and loving Dvorak, I bought this CD. I was disappointed. The concerto seemed to lack momentum and for me never really 'got off the ground'. I have a recording of Stern and Ormandy. That one soars, has direction and is satisfying when finished. This one never really comes alive. Sorry Sarah (but I still wish I could play like you)."
2,Violin just plods along...,"The orchestra is vibrant and alive, but the violin just sort of plods along. I agree with the former reviewer from Washington that this is most noticable in the finale. The Orchestra hits every downbeat hard and the violin just muddles through it. The conductor needs to pick a direction and run with it.Not a bad CD. But not a great cd."
2,I Regret buying this book,As was stated by others this book is a step by step book for readers that are limited in their technical ability.I tried using the index on how to do something and I came up short.Save your time and money.This book was a major disappointment.
2,Be Aware!,"Be aware that the style of this book is almost entirely to step you through one report project after another, building various kinds of reports step by step. As such it is not useful as a technical reference whereby you can look up a topic in the index and go straight to a ""how to"" section relating to that topic.If you wish to learn by completing multiple projects step by step it is fine.I prefer a technical reference style publication."
2,Beginners Only?,"As a very experienced developer I needed to learn about SQL Server Reporting Services as quick as possible as for a project I am starting. I bought this title primarily based on the great reviews, I must say I was very disappointed. If you are already a developer or report writer then I would say this book is not for you.The book started out alright but when I got to chapter 3 titled 'DB 101 : Database Basics' I kind of figured I may have the wrong book. Next chapters were on various levels of report creation, no explanation of the report to be created or it's features, just a very detailed list of step by step instructions to make the report.I know many learn by example but I learned nothing here as I can not take the time nor do I learn from following mindless step by step direction. After a few chapters like this I quit reading the book."
4,Great Book,This book is full of acknowledgement. Step by step teaching of everything related to Report Server 2005.
1,"Sql server 2005 Reportin Service, Brian Larson","SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This is a book seems to be targetting retarded. There is a chapter on datbase concepts - if some one does not know, it is unlikely they will be reading reporting services. Too much fluff and descriptions are buried in the fluff. If you skip the fluff, you may find yourself difficult to connect dots. Too much details on formatting fonts, colors which is completly useless."
2,It Assumes You Are A Little Slow,"I felt like this book thought I couldn't connect the dots. I guess what I should have looked for was more of a reference book. I had no experience with SQL reporting services, but I already knew my way around a SQL query, and although I am mostly a sysadmin by trade, I have dabbled in Microsoft developement products for many years. If you've never seen visual studio and/or you've never touched any kind of relational database or any kind of reporting tools in your life, maybe this would be a good book for you. If you just need the bullet points on how it works and someone to point you in the right direction on some of the more complex things SSRS can do, this book won't work for you.Most of what I have learned about SSRS so far, I have learned from the Internet and Microsoft's included documentation."
5,"Simple, inexpensive...perfect.","This was a stright up, simple purchase. Product was shipped quickly and arrived ontime. Oh, and of coure, it worked perfectly."
4,Good twist on the original legend!,"I am a Native Speaker Spanish teacher in Texas. My students are all Hispanic and have a strong fascination with the legend of ""La Llorona"". They absolutely loved this movie!It is somewhat low-budget, but the acting is pretty good for a horror film. The ending is not very good, however, because it leaves part of the characters' storyline hanging.Overall, I would recommend the dvd to anyone who is fascinated by the legend of ""La Llorona""."
2,May be I am not the gourmand guy,"I know this product is genuine but I just could not work my way around this. I love Boss Bottled which I believe is a gourmand as well. But Lolita Lempicka has a kind of very sweet sugary spicy smell which my nose could not stand. It is very sharp and I would not recommend this for people with sensitive nose. I thought my nose just needs to get used to this type. So I tried 3 times and I had to wash my hands off because I might throw up if I kept it on my skin. Finally, I gave this up to a friend. If you know someone who has this, try before you buy. This is definitely not a blind buy kind of fragrance.Update 02/09/2011I stopped by at my friend's place and I was curious to try this one more time to see if I have developed a liking towards this. Fortunately I have not. It still smells bad on me. I am sorry, but I will not recommend this to any man."
5,Fabulous,1. Items literally came 2 days after I purchased the online item.2. Good quality product. Love the smell.3. The cheapest price compare to the rest out there for this particular brand.4. Would buy them again in the near future.
4,Unusual but very nice men's frangrance,"I like this a lot, though I do have to say that the smell (on me anyway) is extremely long-lasting and can become a bit tiring by the end of the day. It may be better as an evening fragrance - a couple of sprays before you go out will give you a somewhat exotic, black licorice aura."
5,Awesome!,The cotton candy smell is great. One office lady said I smelled like I just got out of shower. This is my favorite EDT.
2,It was alright.,It took me a while to read it. It wasnt terrible. It was actually a pretty decent read. I just wasnt the biggest fan.
3,"Life in Israel, Army Life, Teen / Young Adult Angst","I was not swept away in this book, but I do feel it offers a glimpse of life in Israel and what it's like being in the army. Valerie Zenatti moved to Israel with her family when she was 13, and after completing high school (or taking the Bac) she enlists in the army. The writing tone has a teen ridden angst to it that I just couldn't overcome at times, and frankly, found the book a bit dull as a result. While she documents her army life, visits home and an old boyfriend shen she can, she realizes that she is changing away from her old friends and her old life as well. So, there is nothing new in that message. Even so, I think it was a valuable look at life in Israel from a young adult point of view. Maybe more books that question the whole Israeli precept for being a state and having their war with Palestine (whose land got robbed and stolen in order to make Israel) will contribute to some kind of peace and understanding in that part of the world."
3,DC Harvard Alums Book Club gives 3.5 stars to The Emperor's Tomb,"The DC Harvard Alums Book Club recently read THE EMPEROR'S TOMB and the group recommends this fascinating, first-person ""history"" of the end of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. The 1st person narative was surprisingly effective and holds your attention through out the story. Club members felt that Roth seemed to ""get away with"" breaking most of the rules of fiction, e.g. Roth tells, he does not show. Roth captures the boredom and general uselessness of the cafe society prior to the WW I and how the main character changes with the war, his marriage and return to Vienna. The club members concluded that you do not have to read Roth's masterpiece, RADINSKY'S MARCH, (another club selection) to enjoy THE EMPEROR'S TOMB."
2,Dull,"Joseph Roth's `The Emperor's Tomb' is a curious work of nostalgia about the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the reconstruction of modern Austria through the eyes of a single individual. Unfortunately, one gets the impression that Roth's prose never really gets through in translation as the English remains are often clunky and awkward. Additionally, the novel is filled with unremarkable scenes of peasant life which fail to capture any of the idealism that Roth was apparently striving for. We are left with dull flat characters and dull flat scenarios, often with clumsy marks of emphasis and detail. This may be the result of the fact that `Emperor's Tomb' is essentially a transitional work in Roth's epic quasi-trilogy. Nevertheless, a tremendously overrated novel."
3,"Who kills, will be killed","This book is a long jeremiad on the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the 1st World War. It expresses the nostalgia of the nobility for the spirit of the ancient monarchy, where a preferential place in society was reserved for them. But the war destroyed everything: position, class, estate, money, values, past, present and future.The central theme in this novel is `death': literary (no instinct of procreation)and also symbolically (no fatherland).Written in a profound melancholic tone, this novel is mainly based on a fundamental contradiction. Joseph Roth (through the words of Baron Trotta) believed that only the Habsburgs could maintain and manage a federation of all the people of the Balkan. But, the Habsburgs themselves are responsible for the war disaster and, concomitantly, for the collapse of their empire.Only for Joseph Roth fans."
2,Unfortionately it's poorly made,"I don't mind that the dish is small (the size is clearly stated), but what really bothered me is that it is poorly made. The painting is inferior. Is it really that hard to take an extra minute and not slop the purple color on the green leaves? For 25 dollars per piece you would expect someone to take a little pride in their work."
5,Nice one,"A real page turner, plenty of insight into outsourcing and globalisation, very impressive piece of work!"
5,Grand Finale,"Jubilee is definitely the Grand Finale in this trilogy. While I enthusiastically enjoyed Prelude and Cadence, the way one would enjoy the fireworks on Fourth of July, I eagerly awaited the ""grand finale"" and BJ Hoff certainly delivered! Beautifully wrapping up all the overlapping storylines, I actually was crying by the Epilogue. Bravo!!!"
2,Not for phone number searches!,I purchased this product based on Amazon.com's description that this product's capibilities included searches by phone number. The product box does not indicate such a search is possible and my multiple tries at communication with the CDUSA have gone unanswered. I'm now searching for other product to fill my needs. Other reviews on this conpanies products seem to indicate that CDUSA is a good company not to buy from. Good luck!
3,Too Expensive on Amazon!,"I bought this toy on Amazon for 39.99!!! What a fool I was because I went in to Toys R Us and it was 19.99!! I sure got ripped off! How could these people who sell it justify selling it for twice as much??My son likes playing with it and it is a good toy, but buy it somewhere else!"
5,Great entertainment and education,"My 16 mo boy loves this. Although he does not know the alphabet, he loves the songs it plays and the interactive nature of the sesame street characters. Entertains him for at least 5 times a day!"
5,Must Have for Toddlers!,"This Alphabet Bus is awesome helping toddlers learn their ABCs. It not only sings the alphabet song but it tells you the letter when pressed and it tells you words that begin with the specific letters. At 19 months, my daughter loved it! The alphabet song can be memorized with time but this toy teaches letter recognition... awesome for learning! I would HIGHLY recommend this toy for learning ABCs and Letter Recognition. Money well spent!"
2,Elmo tries to say the alphabet!,I think this would have been an enjoyable learning toy for my granddaughter had it worked properly. Elmo only said the alphabet to the letter h. I don't know if that was all he learned so far or if it was a defective toy! I sure am glad I played with it before giving it as a gift! Really may have put her in state seeing that her name starts with an I! I hope everyone plays with the toys before giving them as gifts! That is what life is about...playing!
2,Everyone I purchase has failed within 2 years or less!,"I have purchased about 15 of these over the recent years. The lights function as they should and provide a sense of security. Unfortunately they do not last long. The lifetime of the motion detector varies from 12 to 24 months. At that point the light either does not come on or stays on 24 hours a day. I then buy a new one and throw the old one away.They come with a 10 year warranty now but when they don't work trying to get a warranty on a 25$ item is a hassle and if you have to send in parts and receipts it really isn't worth it. I have to tell you that I have had 100% failure of every one I have purchased and I am installing a new one today. It can be a hassle to rebuild a new light, remove the old one and if it is high up on the house it is really a pain.I wish the lights just worked or I could find a better and more reliable replacement."
1,Worked for 1 year,"Bought a new house a year ago, and replaced a broken motion light with this cheap piece of junk. It is doing the exact same as another reviewer stated, it stay on 24 hours a day. I read the manual for the troubleshooting tips, but none worked. Then I went to the internet to see if I could find any help troubleshooting, and found a reviewer that is having the exact same problem on an Amazon review of this product. I have 4 other motion lights that were already installed on my house when I bought it, and they are still working perfectly, and look to be about 5 years older, but they are a different brand. I guess that's what happens when you buy cheap."
2,It's okay,"The lights look nice, but they come on, not only at night, but also during the day. They don't have all the settings that other sensor lights have."
1,Not Safe,After a year or 6 munths the lights motion sensor shorted out and triped my braker Panel then i reinstalled it and if it had not ben gronded to the house when i tested it would have killed me so DONT GET THIS LIGHT
3,"""Hikers"" with purely commercial interests....","While working on the Appalachian Trail in Vermont, I had the misfortune of running into this group (or at least part of it). They hiked the AT with purely commercial interests. They were a miserable lot. Overall, the book doesn't say much that hasn't been said already in countless other publications. Just go hike the trail and be happy."
4,Spectacular photograhy and differing views,"The story is about a group of journalists and photographers that decide to trek the Appalachain Trail in segments. The photography is lush and magnificent. The interesting people that are met along the way are well documented and some of the graphics accompanying the text are first rate. I only wish that journalists had been able to fully articulate their personal experiences during their months on the AT. I got the feeling that much of the human interest portion of the story was edited out of the final text. The human feelings of isolation, frustration, and ultimate triumph over the distance and natural elements are largely, and unfortunately, missing from the text. I wish that I had been able to read the daily logs of the individuals during their trek."
4,Great Reference Tool,"It's a great reference tool for those who want a quick glance-over of the Vatican II documents. It nicely captured the essence of each documents. Warning, it's written in paraphrase, a compact style of VC II documents - so that it's more accessible for those who do not have the luxury of time for thorough study. If you don't want to miss a thing, read the original documents - available in the Vatican website."
5,Oxford World's Classics Edition,"This is a great, challenging book. Much like the ominously unfolding twentieth century it so astutely depicts, this novel is fascinating and deeply disturbing. I was so enthralled by it that I had a hard time putting it down. I doubt, though, that I would appreciate Lawrence as much as I do had I not read this particular edition (Oxford World's Classics). David Bradshaw's introductions are the most illuminating and beautifully written I've ever encountered, and this one in particular provided a wealth of insight and context that proved crucial to my enjoyment of the book. Reading the essay was rather like taking a quick class from the most interesting professor you can imagine. I can't recommend it highly enough!"
2,Just can't get into it!,"I'm more than halfway through this book, and I'm still incredibly annoyed by the characters. And I can't say why, but despite Lawrence's beautiful writing, this book is just boring me. I guess it's because I don't like any of the characters. And their endless, self-centered philosophizing is irritating. There have been a couple interesting parts in the plot, but mostly it seems to drag on. I read Sons and Lovers years ago and enjoyed it, and I recently read Lady Chatterley's Lover--that one I greatly enjoyed. Does anyone know if Lawrence wrote other books that measure up to Lady Chatterley? Because it certainly isn't Women in Love!"
2,I must be missing something,"I couldnt' stand these people- usually I don't mind books of great reflection and little action, but these people were dreadful! I'll try again sometime, but not when I'm dealing with unlikeable people in real life."
3,Annoying yet engrossing,"The ideas and relationships explored in Women in Love are intense and fascinating although they are undermined by Lawrence's unneccessary verbosity and his seeming obsession with his own cleverness. The impersonal style employed would, I feel, better suit a philosophical discursive essay than a novel."
3,Women In Love,Gerald Cricha richstud wonGudrun(Poorly chosen:He got frozenout)Ursulalacked her colourbut for Birkinthrew her work in(Same old plot:they tied the knot)
1,Very offensive,"I had just started the ""humanities"" requirement for my degree program and was assigned this book to read for a literature course. I did not expect, from the title, that it would be a book for a Christian, but I believe in respecting authority, so I tried to read the book. But I was not able to finish it. It was so dark and full of all kinds of morbid things, that were almost as bad as the pornography. It had no redeeming feature. I felt ashamed while I was reading it, and it was so bad that even the places which were all right seemed suspicious. I thought, how will he find something weird and ugly here? This book was written back when England was full of labor unrest and socialism and paganism and what they called ""free love"" so I suppose this had something to do with it.Some of the Christians in my class wanted to complain to the Dean about a hostile study environment for Christians, but we were afraid of retribution by secular humanists."
5,The tortures of love and relationships stripped raw,"I first read this book when required to in college. I did not appreciate it at all -I found it boring and hated it. However, since then I've lost track of how many times I've picked this book up in my life. Sometimes I re-read it in its entirety, and on others, only excerpts that were moving to me. This book is full of scenes and passages that are so pulling on emotions and stir such deep introspective thoughts that it's almost disturbing.The story contains characters whose relationships are difficult to relate to, and yet, somehow are familiar at the same time. The passions are mostly emotional and under the surface even though there is sex and are lots of discussions about it.In the very first chapter, one of the sisters, Gudren, feels ""I shall know more of that man."" From this scene on, it's torturous for both the characters and the reader as this is not a love story, but a story about what love does to people."
4,Keep reading--it gets great!,"I found the first couple hundred pages slow going. My mistake was to read it before The Rainbow, which I also intend to read, since it too is on the Modern Library panel's list of the best novels writtten in English in ths centruy. But I found when I finished the book I thought it well worth reading, even tho the characters are too cerebral for a commonsenseical person such as I think I am."
3,Women In Love,"This melodramatic novel self-consciously revels in the new freedoms of post-WWI Europe. As a newcomer to Lawrence, I can sense his enjoyment in attacking taboo subjects. Unfortunately, the character development is unconvincing and ultimately condemns the book to an interesting period piece instead of an enduring classic."
1,I hated this book despite the great message it conveys.,"Okay, I normally love classics, but while reading Women in Love I couldn't help thinking what a horrible book it was. Although in the novel Lawrence tries to portray the effects of an industrial world on the mind and soul, a very interesting topic, the novel itself is dark, frightening, and way too wordy. Reading this book is like being on an intellectual merry go round that never ends. Even the love story of the novel is demonic and twisted. The story just seems so farfetched from reality -- the characters are just not people you can connect with and the women seem either stupid, cold, or calculating. The story could have been told so much better, and if Lawrence wanted to comment yo such an extent much on man's mind, why not become a psychologist and not waste a reader's time with so much intellectual blabber! Far too dark and wordy for my taste!"
2,"brilliant writer, dreadful book","Women in Love is a very tedious read. Sure, the author does use the English language brilliantly. But perhaps too brilliantly; some passages take repeated reading to understand what is going on!But the most frustrating aspect of this book is the characters. None of them are the kind of people you'd want to know. And I never met any people who talk drival about love, relationships, their insecurities, etc. Worse, one of the characters is a thinly disguised D.H. Lawrence - and this character is the worst! :-)I was very disappointed with this novel, but not with its author. With such a rich command of the English language I can only hope that he had put it into better use ... and thus deserving his fine reputation."
1,What a waste of time.,"This book has no likeable characters, and because of this, no one really cares about the characters' feelings and actions. In fact, I wanted them all to be miserable, because they made me so miserable. The characters are too self-centered to enjoy them."
3,It was a chore getting through this in one piece.,"I recently read this book (finished it April 30th of this year, actually), and while it didn't take me terribly long to read (three weeks, if that), it was really difficult to get through it. At times it was terribly confusing, and I had to re-read passages to get the full meaning every once in a while, but once I did, I found myself not terribly impressed with it. Unfortunately, my English teacher spoiled every book we read this semester (Fathers and Sons, Madame Bovary, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, A Portrait of a Lady, and Women in Love), so nothing in the book came as a surprise, which disappointed me even more. One good thing she did, however, was explaining some of the more difficult scenes [...], which helped me appreciate the novel more than I normally would. I have to say, however, that I just didn't like it very much. I also have to say, that I don't regret reading it, and I'll always remember it."
3,"Slow start, gets better.","I finished this book on the second try. It's wordy - focusing more on the psychological turmoil of the characters than in physical action. Hence most of the time they sit around and talk to each other or sit around and stuggle internally with their own beliefs and emotions. If this book hadn't been such a ""classic"", I would have given up on it. However, I forced myself to continue and found after struggling through the first 75 pages, that I really enjoyed the characters and found Lawrence's views on the nature of humanity and love intriguing and relevant."
4,Airtex fuel pump,"Airtex fuel pump appears well make and fitted my Toyota truck without problem. However, picture from Amazon is confusing. It shows a drawing of entire assembly included bracket and most important, the strainer. Upon receiving the package, I found there no strainer and gasket (another must have part); I had to place new order for that. It was not only surprisingly expensive but wasting of time. Airtex strainer size is half of my original strainer, I am not sure like it? Amazon also not listing Airtex gasket, I had to order the Bosch made."
5,cassette tape purchase,"My car's radio takes CD and tape cassettes. The 110 minute length cassette are becoming hard to find and a two-hour radio program fits this size very well. Since I still record these shows I needed more of these and the seller not only was very helpful but gave me tips on how to make multiple orders. This is my second order with him, am very satisfied and would recommend doing business with this seller."
4,Sweet and heart warming,"This book gives us a warm place in our hearts to share a cup of tea and sweetness. A reason to renew old friendships and perhaps bring back the art of afternoon conversation. Celebrate parenthood, friendship,and just being human. My mother and I shared many things over a cup of tea some good and some not so good, but we discussed each topic and I remember that today."
5,A breakthrough in covering gaming soundtracks.,"It's very fitting that this album is as complex as it is; Chrono Trigger was one of the most groundbreaking games of the decade that birthed it. This soundtrack is as much for fans of music as it is for fans of gaming. The songs comprise a fusion of sounds, from bluesy bass to overpowering jazz horn sections to killer guitar riffs. The songs are covers, not remixes, with a variety of musicians giving their own take on the songs that are so familiar to fans of the game. Of all the gaming-related albums I own, this is the best. If you're even the slightest Chrono fan or just love the game's music, you need to add this concoction of interest to your collection, the same goes for fans of the jazz genre overall."
3,Pointless,"I did not understand why this movie was even made. It seems to glorify vigilante justice. I suppose it would be popular with the Phoenix, AZ sheriff."
3,Violent and dark,"The main actor is the Christopher Lambert (""Highlander"") of Brazil. He plays the role in an almost totally deadpan manner. It is very hard to put yourself into his shoes, because he appears to be a morose sociopath. Brazil is depicted as corrupt and violent. A very, very dark and depressing film."
2,"not happy, no english subtitles","I have already done 1 review, but here goes with another 1. I bought this dvd for my Son (English) & Latvian Daughter-in-law.They were expecting the film to be with English subtitles, but sad to say its not. They are Very Very disappointed, so am I as Its a complete waste of my money.PLUS THIS DVD NOT COMPATIBLE WITH UK DVD PLAYER...........BEWARE!!!!!!!!"
4,Roaming Tuscany with Romer,"Life and Food in an Italian Valley (subtitle) is a memoir, cookbook and record of a Tuscan farm family. I found the book to be a better read than Mayes' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" for it gives a more comprehensive look at daily family life rather than one person's experiences. The tweleve chapters--January through December--provide the reader a glimspe of the monthly activities of the Cerotti estate offering a look at their lives including their food, work, family and celebrations. Romer gave me a sense of being a part of the Cerotti household for I became engaged with them as if I were a family member. Sitting at Silvana's kitchen table allowed me to learn much about traditional Tuscan food which has been handed down from one generation to the next."
2,ONE TUSCAN HOUSEHOLD,"I found this book very disappointing. It could even be said to be boring. I guess I didn't read the description/reviews properly as I was expecting more of a story line, perhaps like Frances Mayes in Under the Tuscan Sun or Peter Mayle in A Year in Provence."
1,found it boring,"I read this book solely based on the author's fantastic first book ""time love and memory"", but found this book to be utterly boring. Instead of an entertaining read filled with scientific facts, we get the tragic and predictable story. Given the slow pace of medical research on most complex disease, the odds of even a billionare being able to save a brother in a short time frame are near zero, let alone a family of more modest resources. The writing style seemed overly simplistic, and i kept thinking that there were many facets of the story that to me, would be much more interesting, but didn't get told for whatever reason. With great respect for the author, i found this particular book unappealing."
5,The Best Weight Loss Program I've Been On,"I bought ""The Calcium Key"" about a month ago, and have had spectacular weight loss within an abbreviated period of time. I love the meal plans, and I am also thrilled with a diet that includes additional calcium in my daily food intake. What an interesting book, too. I have recommended it to all my friends, and feel that everyone will find this book extremely beneficial. It is tough wading through all the weight loss books on the market today, but I think that ""The Calcium Key"" should be way up there with the best of them!"
1,Self Serving...Me...Me...Me,"I think the research and concept behind this book is sound, but the tone is very self-serving. There have been many researchers in many universities, not only around the country, but around the world working on this topic, and they should have been given much more recogition for their efforts and their contribution. For that reason, I found The Calcium Diet, by Edita Kaye to be a much more balanced approach which talks about all the new research and gives a time-line as well as generous credit to all the researchers working in their field. If you have a choice and would like more information, I would go for the Kaye book."
1,Self Serving,"I was very interested in the new research currently available about calcium as a weight loss nutrient, but I was very disappointed in this book. Zemel, is very self-serving and it reads as though he were the only one to discover the calcium-weight loss connection. In fact, there are many researchers making significant contributions to this effort, not only here but around the world. I found The Calcium Diet by Edita Kaye to be a better pick. Kaye lays out a very comprehensive time line and tracks the research. Kaye also gives great deal of credit to all the many researchers working in the field. I found the Kaye book comprehensive, easy to read, and for my money and interest, a better choice."
5,Classy beadwork designs,"This book is written in detail and in a manner that you can follow easily. Each design gives explicit details of what materials are needed and how to complete the item. Most items are not difficult to accomplish or find the necessary materials for them. You can make assorted Native American style or antique looking earrings, necklaces and bracelets. There are also beaded watches, beaded brooches, and other styled necklaces."
4,Bringing to life,"Beautiful settings, terrible circumstances (understatement) and the will to survive left a legacy to this day. The name Draper is all over the New River Valley because of the perseverance of this one person. Thanks for bringing this life story alive again!"
1,Awful - home movie,I enjoyed watching Follow the River and reading the book so I decided to buy this movie. It is awful. How in the world did I pay $24 for this on Amazon? It's like a homemade movie. Ugh!!! I would give it zero stars if I could.
5,Captivating,I am kin to Mary Draper Ingles. Good film for children as well. What a brave role model for this generation.
3,"despite cute cover, not an ideal introduction to topic","Despite the book's cute cover, for most people this is not an ideal introduction to ethics and animals topics. The problem is that it's just not an ideally clear and straightforward example of philosophical writing. It's not an easy book to read. Perhaps this is because it's in translation, but I think many -- unless they are already skilled in reading philosophy -- will have a real hard time with it. Try DeGrazia's book or the ""Magpies, Men and Morals"" book for a more accessible introduction. The content of this is good, it's just not as accessible as it should be."
4,Good service,"This product came exactly as it was promised. Shipping was slower than expected though.Overall, I was pleased."
4,Worth Buying,"The video and sound quality are excellent on the DVD. You get ten songs and the making-of and it is definitely worth buying if you love the band. If you are a casualy fan, you may think it is not worth spending $50 for something that isn't long at all. If you are fan obsessed, love the band to death and have the money to spend, then this is way worth getting! I bought it and am glad I did. The only downer is that it is the concert version video for the song Obscure. I would rather have the real video. Oh well."
1,BEWARE OF TOSHIBA,"I sent my Toshiba Satellite to the company for warranty service and never got it back and the company has ignored all requests, including those by the Better Business Bureau."
3,Okay Laptop.....,"This was one of the first laptops I bought from Amazon, and I mist say when I bought it, it was a good price and a very good configuration. Other then that, it was one of my worst purchases and money wasted. It was a gift to my brother, who hated this machine like anything and envied me with the Vaio I had. I am hoping to buy a Sony Vaio or a Macbook Pro for him next time."
4,Definately a step back in the right direction...,"After their disappointing second album, it's good to have Vast getting back on the right track. Granted, ""Visual Audio Sensory Theatre"" set the bar pretty steep, but looking back on it, ""Music for People"" was just a weak, overly commercial effort. Does the music on ""Nude"" reach up the lofty heights of quality set by their debut? Quite frankly, No. It feels a bit stilted, while the debut had an effortless flow. The music isn't as diverse as either of the previous albums, and lyrics, while personal, aren't as powerful as Crosby's lyrics have been in the past. However, there is a lot to like here, as well. ""Turquoise"" and ""Desert Garden"" are great as bookends, ""Be with me"" is great and ""Japanese Fantasy"" is just cool. And I'm glad to hear that Jon Crosby has some more good songs in him. It gives me hope for the future."
2,Pretty average Im sorry to say,"I am a HUGE VAST fan. But wow, I am really disappointed. The first 3 songs are great, but as soon as you get to the 4th song the rest just bore you. It's like Jon got really bummed out, began taking some ""mood altering drugs"" (because his big record label dropped him) and then started listing to John Tesh CD's. Way way too much piano, and way way too depressing. I hate say it, but I see why Elektra records dropped him. I hope he doesn't go down the MINISTRY trail and start making a bunch of bad CD's. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because I'm a big fan. You may want to check out the Kidneythieves. Female singer, with an edge that VAST used to have. As you can see I don't write many reviews, but I had to put my 2 cents out there this time."
3,Where's the energy?,"There's a lot of good music on this cd, it just sometimes seems devoid of life, as finding a progressive tempo in any song can be rather difficult. ""Music For People"" was definitely a better album. Still, if you really enjoyed the slower and quieter songs on that album, there's a lot of good music to be found here... the low rating really just reflects my expectations for more energy... I wanted more of a rock record than this is."
4,"Excellent, but not as good as the previous two albums","I'm a huge Vast fan (if you haven't noticed). I bought ""Visual Audio Sensory Theater"" when it was freshly out. I bought ""Music for People"" at the first opportunity. I leapt at the chance to buy ""Crimson"" and ""Turquoise"" and salivated at the chance to listen to a new, fully-realized Vast album.I was, alas, disappointed. Don't get me wrong, ""Nude"" is an excellent record, but it just doesn't measure up to Crosby's past efforts. I had extraordinarily high expectations, justified in view of the brilliance of ""VAST"" and ""Music for People"". Many of the songs are phenomenal, however. ""Turquoise"", ""Thrown Away"", ""Winter in my Heart"", and ""Desert Garden"" are mind-blowing. Unfortunately, most of the rest of the record just doesn't match up. It's good, but not great.Still, I would highly recommend this album to anyone, particularly in this era where emo rock has turned nauseating and hip-hop's descended to the depths of idiocy."
4,This is a STRONG CD,My sister turned me on to this artist after hearing his work in a surfing video. The music is just different enough to engage. I strongly recommend getting this CD. His guitar work is mui cool.
2,Vast is capable of so much better,"They've proved it on both of their previous albums. ""V.A.S.T."" was a riveting album with an astoundingly original sound that captivated the mind as well as the ears. ""Music for People"" was a big departure stylistically, but featured several brilliantly crafted songs. ""Nude"" fails to measure up. ""Turqouise"" and ""Don't Take Your Love Away"" were the only songs that stuck in my head for more than a few minutes after they were over. The music doesn't sound very dynamic at all, and the lyrics sound a bit more trite than they have in the past. Vast is certainly an artist that is worth hearing, but ""Nude"" is not the right album to use. Listen to ""V.A.S.T."" and ""Music for People"", and hope that the next release is a return to form."
3,Repetition,"Once a band finds its sound, it does one of three things: refines it, repeats themselves, or does something else entirely. On Nude, Jon Crosby's third release as Vast, he mostly repeats himself. That's not terrible. Crosby named his band correctly - Vast's sound from day one has been mock-gothic and cinematic, and he's in fine form on the CD openers ""Turquoise"" and ""Thrown Away"". He's also adept at sad and gorgeous ballads, as on ""Winter in My Heart"". Elsewhere, it's business as usual, though he does offer himself an escape route in the closing ""Desert Garden"", where he strips all instrumentation down to guitar and voice and comes up with the best Dashboard Confessional song since they went electric."
2,Rip-Off,NO ONE needs three feet of cable for $30 ($10/ft). Think before you buy- longer versions of the same cable can be bought for less money on this very site.
5,This is a great song!,This is a great song! And very fresh too! Valeria is a great singer and dancer. And she sings really well.
2,*It's Ok*,This isn't really my style of music. I've listened to it only a couple of times. Maybe it'll grow on me~1. Main (or Ooh La La)- Its not bad. It has a nice beat. Its just not really focusing on lyrics. A good beach song :-)2. I Think I'm Falling in Love- It seems kinda Latin.. I like some Latin like Gloria Estefan but this isn't my favorite.
2,Ooh...I Mean Oh,"When female pop sensation meets latin girl, you see Valeria. Ooh La La isn't a very good song if you ask me. I think that she has childish lyrics and her songs are very low class. Sorry guys, by Valeria isn't very good. Since looks are diseving, you won't like this.1. Ooh La La - Teenie bopper song. Low class lyrics with teenage girl seeking record deal voice. Latin song. More of a Brittney Spears than a Shakira. 1/5 stars.2.I Think I'm In Love - Latin song as well. Better than Ooh La La. But still not very good. 3/5 Stars.As I said, not a very good single. You can do better Valeria.2."
5,Democrazy: even gets teens interested in current events,"Michael Legge's latest movie may well be his best yet. It's got plenty of humor, but the cultural zingers are bang-on enough that they make you cringe. My teens try to see how many of the references they know, and are doing pretty well. I have a feeling it won't do as well in ""Red States"" as in ""Blue States"" -- but if you're feeling Blue and want to watch something bitingly satirical, extremely clever, AND having the appropriate touch of stupid humor, watch ""Democrazy"" -- preferably, over and over. With any luck, it'll save the world."
1,"Just bad, not clever or funny.","I don't really rate movies, but after seeing this movie I felt two hours of my life were stolen and I must warn others. I was lured in by the name, thinking it was some good political satire. However its not at all clever, and the humor may appeal to six year olds, but thats probably about it. This is really the worst movie I've seen since I had to sit through a few hours of student films at my friends graduation (and even a lot of those were better). The budget on this film must have been counted in pizza slices given to the actors. I could only wonder how the people making this film could not see how bad it is and would actually decide to publish it. While watching I had to remind myself that this isn't someone's homevideo shot back in 1988. Everythig is bad, the story, the acting, the production. Unless you enjoy harping on realy bad films, avoid this one."
4,Una lectura original.,"Como una persona curiosa he encontrado este libro altamente satisfactorio. El autor expone la tesis que muchos de los genios históricamente relevantes (la mayoría incluso) han sido individuos aquejados por un mal maniaco-depresivo, en el cual han sido increíblemente prolíficos en sus momentos de manía y sus momentos de depresión (en mucho de ellos) explican el comportamiento aberrante históricamente registrado. Es un libro que se lee en poco tiempo, un excelente acompañante para una lectura de fin de semana."
3,Tends to leak,"This is a good quality product, but unless perfectly worn, these swim goggles tend to leak. The manufacturer says not to use tension on the straps, but to use suction on the eyepieces. That is what causes the problem...the suction breaks sometimes. The field of view is excellent. I do recomend these, but wear them using tension AND suction."
5,Great,They are very comfortable and look good. They don't decrease the brightness of the sunlight much though.
1,Remake of an old style -- NOT GOOD,"The new Baja googles do NOT fit like the old ones (which are no longer available). These hurt my eye sockets and nose. I tried the new pair several times and each time could not wait to take them off. Speedo, bring back the old design!"
4,"Goggles are great, directions are poor","The new Speedo Baja swim goggles have great, panaramic views underwater (wider than most other goggles, including other Speedos). The directions on the package for adjusting the size of the strap are from another world. ""Lift lever to release"" (loosen the strap) really should be ""push button down to release."" After I got the size adjusted, the underwater views were awesome. These are definitely adult-size goggles by the way. Not a Junior size."
1,How to screw up a good thing,"This product sucks the big one! Whatever chink who made the decision to change the style really blew it. The old ones were the best Jerry, the best."
4,Swim goggles,"This product is good for swimming. It fits well. Although the lens suck. They are not clear for viewing, they don't leak, but the inside of the lens don't bead moisture like it should . In my opinion."
2,Just OK,"The goggles are fairly comfortable and large, in fact a bit large for me which was a bit of a surprise but they do seal up fairly well. My complaint with these, and the reason for the two rating is thus.1. They fog up almost as quickly as my old Speedo goggles (several years old) which is after about one lap of the pool. Of course I do swim in cool water, that may render a different result than using them in the tropics.2. For whatever reason, these goggles distort my underwater view. Could it be the tinting? I don't know, but what I do know, is that my old goggles are clear and even though scratched up, they still provide a clear view.For what it's worth, I would not purchase these again."
2,Not as good as the old style,"The old Baja style had large curved lenses and soft comfortable padding. The new style is smaller in all dimensions, and does seem to leak more--for me at least. Of course leaking is almost always about the shape of your eyes vs the shape of the goggles, so I would just say that the goggles don't fit *me* as well as they used to.But that begs the question: given how very important the fit is for goggles, why on EARTH would you change the fit and keep the same name? Just call it something else.Summary: these are not 'Baja' goggles, they are something new. They aren't bad, but they aren't the same."
1,Beware! This is not the product illustrated,"The illustration shows the original Baja googles and they were great - very comfortable, great seal, etc.The new googles are absolute junk.o The eye-pieces are MUCH smaller, they really do not even deserve to be called ""over-sized"".o They leako They simply feel cheap.It is clear that Speedo ""redesigned"" the googles to cut costs, not to make them better."
5,Best one I've tried,Highly recommended for any amateur swimmer. Minimal fogging and minimal leakage. Slightly larger than the standard pair (but not like you are wearing a space mask) which really helps with visibility.
1,Very dissappointed,"I did not receive this text and had to contact the seller only to find out that the book was out of stock and my money would be refunded. Very unprofessional business ethics. I paid extra to have the shipping expedited and had I not contacted the seller, I would still be waiting for the book."
3,Life on the Wire,"Good insights into life as a telegraph operator with many interesting stories. However, without footnotes and bibliography it is just one persons view."
5,Carving techniques,The video was very informative and thoroughly explained the the techniques of carving. This is a very good resource for anyone strating out in carving.
4,Don't Buy TWICE,"This is recommended when you buy Mary and Max but it is a bonus on that DVD so if you buy Mary and Max don't buy this seperately, it is a fine alone though. Just a heads up cause I bought them both because Harvie was only 6.53 but when I noticed my mistake it would cost over three to send it back so I am just going to keep it but it is completely uneccessary."
1,Do Not Watch,"I saw this film in an animation film fstival by where i live, and i can say that i did not like it at all. the story was very boring and moved very slowly. this movie was just completely unappealing. i would not waste my money on this movie, not even to rent it."
3,Gothic Cabaret?,"Once you get past the falsetto Lotte-Lenya-meets-Kevin-Coyne voice, you can concentrate on the meta-Gorey lyrics. The words come from original Gorey texts that have been liberally adapted. If anything, they emphasise the commonalities with the world of Charles Addams. The musical style is, as the group itself says, avant-garde cabaret. The Kronos Quartet, despite being co-stars, do not seek to upstage the Tiger Lilies.Definitely recommended for Gorey fans and Goths who love serious (?) cabaret (if you are out there)."
1,disappointed,I have tried to put this CD into iTunes and it will not appear even though my mac says it is in there. I am disappointed as this is how I planned to listen to it [ and on my iPad]. If this option is blocked in some way I should have been told in advance of purchase.
2,Kronos fans need not apply,"I got this CD because I am a longtime Kronos Quartet fan and I have all their other CDs. Compared to most of their other music, this is toy music; you shouldn't expect Shostakovich. I found Martyn Jaques' falsetto singing really irritating; about the best I can say for it is that it's better than Tiny Tim's singing. If you're looking for camp, you might like this, but I wasn't looking for camp.If you're a Kronos fan and you really intend to get all their recordings, buy this one last. (Get ""Night Prayers"" first.)"
4,The French Rivera at its best!,"Having been to the French Riviera several times, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere portrayed in this movie. There is quite a bit of Nudity which is absolutely authentic for San Tropez. It stars the mostly naked Valerie Kaprisky who you may remember from the Richard Gere movie - Breathless! This movie is actually well made and interesting; with a plot that involves the personal relationships of several beach loving families, vacationers and party animals. If you enjoy beautiful people, jealousy and no tan lines, you'll enjoy this movie. However, speaking French would certainly make this movie more enjoyable. Subtitles are provided."
1,Still no Delivery,"This is the worst seller ever. I bought this book in January, this is march and the book hasn't been delivered. I mean how long does it take for a book to be delivered.I feel as if I've been duped.Buyers beware"
5,A fine work of fiction by a great American novelist,"I was mesmerized by this poignant tale of a Lakota stranded in late 19th Century France, trapped by circumstances almost beyond his control. This powerful, thoughtful look of an alien trapped in a culture almost beyond his understanding is one worth reading. Although I won't spoil readers by divulging this novel's ending, I will say that it is a captivating tale about how Charging Elk confronts his loneliness, deals with what fate has brought him, and ultimately, finds redemption and hope. I was very pleasantly surprised with James Welch's fine prose and apt skill at story telling. I certainly look forward to reading his other works soon."
5,Infused with quiet power.,"Without going into into the details of the story of ""Heartsong..."" I would just like to state that this was one of the most engrossing books I have read of late. A rare view into the human heart and soul of a man trapped in solitude. I met Mr. Welch at a book signing. I had not read any of his books and did not know what to expect from this one. I am a new fan and will definately catch up with all of them!"
1,Very disappointed,"I had hoped to learn about the Indian ways of living and beliefs etc. This man could have been from Spain or Brazil and been the same book.I had bought it to read then send to my Pop but ended up only scanning the last two chapters and gave it to the thrift store.My hubby read it first (I was still reading another book) and likewise was ""underwhelmed"" by it.Would not recommend it for any reason."
1,Heart Song of Charging Elk,"Those who find this book riviting and exciting should read the true life story of Black Elk, the Oglala Holy Man, from which this story is taken. My opinion of this book is that it is another form blasphemy against not only a Holy Man, Black Elk, but to the Oglala and the Lakota people. Another way to take something that does not belong to you......."
4,This one will get you!,"I think that taking a good look at the cover of this book will tell you a lot of what is inside. The depth of the eyes of the Indian on the jacket just draws you in, like the story. My, my what a good read. Locations described in South Dakota and Wyoming bring back memories of traveling through these areas. I have not yet read ""Fools Crow"" by Welch, but reading the reviews of it indicate that it too will not disppoint the reader. I too would agree that the ""love scenes"" are discribed in a more Collins fashion, but hey, a little sex can perky up any story."
2,The idea has so much potential....,"I think what Welch lacked was a good editor. The character of Charging Elk is very difficult to identify with, not because of the historical or ethnic distance, but because the reader rarely gets inside of his head. In addition, there are some hard to believe inconsistencies in language, etc., an ending that, though not your normal ""happy ending"" was too neatly tied up too quickly, and a mechanical, naturalistic approach to sex that is less than inspiring. The story has so much potential, but I was disappointed in the realization of it. (Also note: if you are easily offended, several passages may disturb you.)"
2,Wrong color.,Got this paddle because i love halex and i wanted a orange and black paddle. i got the paddle but it was blue and green. looks completely retarded. still a good paddle though. i wish amazon would have provided a color selector
1,Don't bother,"This book is useless. They miss Sango and Shippou for one thing. and for another, NONE OF THIS INFORMATION IS NEW. I THOUGHT I was buying the novelazation of Inuyasha that was released in '04 in Japan which contained the first chapters redrawn by Takahashi and some other information, like what happened to Kagome's dad. Turns out this is just useless, everything in it you can find out from watching a episode or three of the series. And it's CONSTANTLY repeating itself. Yes. We know. Kikyou died. Now she's not. Why do they have to repeat it every other paragraph!?"
3,OMG!!!!!,I haven't read the book yet but I watched the youtube series and boy was that good so I'm hoping the book will be too. bye! (I gotta go read it!!)
5,awesome,i loved the inuyasha series and even got the box sets. this book helps with some untold mysteries from whem the show would end. Very good and hope this bppk gets far.
2,Tastes like tin...,"I bought this thinking that it would be a good idea for those evenings when I'm too tired to cook - while it's easy to prepare, it has a nasty tinny flavor.I won't be buying this again."
5,Saved the Day!,"This is the first gluten-free product I found that my daughter likes. Perhaps ""likes"" isn't the right word -- she eats large helpings every time I serve it. For a little variety, I put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix.This is THE favorite in our household."
5,Fantastic Rub Recipes,This is a great way to make ruba to give as gifts. In the past I have gotten recipes and then had to make up cards etc.. If this one it gives you the recipe and then also gives you 2 sets of cards to put with the mixes. This gives you everything you need and then you also still have the recipes if you want to make more than what it available.There are some interesting rubs to be used for all different kinds of meats etc...
5,Gifts From the Heart,"After a frightening illness diagnosis I changed how I ate and cooked and started growing my own herbs spices and veggies. I purchased this book to use as guideline for my homegrown items to make various rubs for myself, and to give as gifts to family, and friends, guests and others as a healthier way of enjoying their foods. It was received quickly in excellent condition and has already been put to use. My decision to buy was based on comments and reviews. These are gifts made from my labor, & my concern,and that can be used and appreciated by everyone, it saves money for recipients as well as eating healthier! Good rubs are costly! It's a hobby I do all year and enjoy making and giving to others. The book itself makes an excellent gift as well. Very glad I made decision to purchase from this seller and will try other offers as well."
2,Why was it open?,"Package came with no receipt and item was opened but not the envelope. Bu neither, guys came to talk to him"
5,A fun read!,"When I used to read the Saddle Club books, this was one of my favs. I loved the way Stevie schemed Bob and Lisa's relationship and Veronica's failed scheme added to the hysterias! I love this one!"
1,Buggy...don't buy it yet!,"As a user of Bryce 3D and Bryce 4, and very satisfied with them, I'm very disappointed that Corel apparently felt they had to rush this release out before they debugged it. On 3D graphics discussion boards across the internet, folks are saying they had to deinstall it.There are several serious problems with this release. It renders extremely slow; at least twice as slow as Bryce 4. It hangs machines (I've had this experience with W2K machine with 512 memory), crashes machines, loses track of where files are. The tree lab has possibilities, but the trees are still extremely polygon intensive, and more than a few trees duplicated in your scene may cause a crash, or rendering errors that leave parts of the trees missing.Corel is supposedly working on a patch right now; I'd advise that if you have Bryce 4, keep it...don't bother with Bryce 5 until they get the problems ironed out."
2,Have 4 - stick with it!,"Well Metacreations/fractal/Corel has finally decided to grab our wallets again. I raced to buy this but was confounded to find out that the valid bryce 4 password that starts bryce 4 DOESN't work as the upgrade and the customer has to reach customer service. Unfortunately, they refer you to tech support. So for the addition of trees, a bigger interface, ""lots of new features"" that really aren't even outlined in the new manual, I have to kill this release and warn those to buy 2 good animation books instead!"
3,Good but not realistic,"The book is interesting for the amount and variety of submission holds listed. I picked several very good moves that I had not seen elsewhere. However many/most of the moves require that you have either an incompetent or nearly comatose opponent. While I don't doubt that they would be quite painful, actually getting someone in many of the exotic holds listed is not realistic."
2,So-So,"I like the watch. However, on line the description said, 'red leather band'. On line it looks tan and does not give a true dipiction of the color. The band is red, but it is bright orange/red.....not exactly what I wanted"
5,Vic Firth rules pepper mills,"The first time I purchased a Vic Firth lighthouse pepper mill, it was for a little beach cottage we owned. I wasn't expecting that it would be the best pepper mill we ever owned, and we owned several high end pepper mills. That first Vic Firth pepper mills grinds as well today as it did 10 years ago. I lost it in a divorce. I've just purchased this new one and recommend them to anyone who loves pepper or loves cooking. It has a perfect grind and is easily adjusted for individual tastes. And it never wears out!"
1,WRONG LISTING,Buyer beware. This book is listed as the solutions manual for the 5th edition textbook. WRONG! This manual does not match the text...
1,Lacking...EVERYTHING OF IMPORTANCE,"As an educator, I expect a study guide to go beyond supplying the basic multiple choice answers. I was dismayed to discover that it neglected detailed explainations regarding the asnwers. Furthermore, the book totally ignores the essay portion. There were NO sample essays. I was also disappointed that Barons had not publshed a book of their own to show these kooks a thing or two about true test prep. It was a loser for me :("
1,AHHAHAHAHAHHA,"I give this book one star without actually reading it and heres why: cause you guys think your vampires. Now...do you actually think your vampires, as in undead powerful immortals, or do you use the term to mean emo goth blood fetishist? I realy really hope its the latter. I know A LOT about vampires, spent most of my life researching them and have an extensive library, and not one of those books is written by a ""vampire"", why? Because, at least in the literal sence, they do not exist; and if they did, would they be posting comments on Amazon? Pfffft..."
2,Pass on this one...,"I had high hopes that this would be a great set. I purchased this comforter, the matching sham, sheets, and the decorative pillow. The quality is very disappointing. The fabric is thin and cheap, and the stuffing in the comforter is very stiff (even makes noise when you squeeze it). I was so excited to make a nice bed for my ten year old son, but I will be sending these back. I expected more from the Nautica brand, but this just did not deliver. Also, the navy fabric is a cotton chino material that everything sticks too! With it being navy, it shows a lot of lint. I liked some of the other Nautica styles I saw here on Amazon, but I don't think I will trust Nautica again."
5,Awesome product. Super comfy...,"Extremely comfortable, a little heavy but will keep you winter warm. Super soft and looks great. The price is right too. The same comforter is 60 more on some other sites. Grab it while you can"
5,Well made and excellent for a teenager's bedroom.,"I bought this comforter (actually I've boughten several nautica comforters this christmas season) along with the Seagrove sham for a teenage boy. The colors are perfect, construction is excellent. As for teenage boy's bedding set up - it's 'cool' - as in the good kind of cool =)"
4,never released in america 'til now!,"this is another of my all time favorites, i had this album when i was only 20 years old....this is a japanese import complete with japanese liner notes, the correct title is ""kooper session"", not ""volume 2 kooper sessions"", but it is one and the same. shuggie otis was fifteen years old at the time, but boy, does he rip on guitar. my two favorite tracks are #'s 5 and 7, ""12:15 slow goonbash blues"" and ""shuggies shuffle"", a definate MUST for all blues/rock lovers."
4,enjoyable romp from an unlikely duo!,"Al kooper's previous album(supersession)set the standard for superstar jam albums so this record,released just one year later,was bound to be overlooked.However,since most of shuggie otis' discography has been reissued in recent years it only seemed natural that eventually they would dust off this little gem.The record is broken into two sides:side one consists of concise readings of more tradionally based blues material while side two is where shuggie and al decide to stretch out in the form of three lenghty jams.All and all this album is a nice little record that if you dig shuggie otis is well worth forking over the ten or twelve bucks for the experience."
4,should be called otis session (with al kooper),"Excellent guitar work from 15-year-old Otis. He outshines Al Kooper at every turn. A must-own album, especially for lovers of the rockin' electric blues style of the late '60s and early '70s."
2,Follow in Your Father's Footsteps,"This was my first autographed book. Sammy used to drink at my Uncle Midgie's WHITE ROSE TAVERN in Brooklyn in the fifties. It was my introduction to Murder, Inc. and the Jewish mob in Brooklyn.Fifty years later I found a copy through ABE.My copy had been inscribed: Follow in your father's footsteps and you'll be a champion."

5,A True Classic,"You will never, ever tire of this music. It is timeless, classic, sophisticated and moving. I have owned this for probably 9 years and love it just as much the first time I listened to it. Superb!!!!!!"
3,Not arranged alphabetically!,"While this encyclopedia is in-depth and informational, it is not arranged alphabetically by vegetable, fruit, or herb, so we found it rather difficult to navigate."
4,After 2 months of use,"Bottom Line Recommendation: Buy these for the style factor, maybe buy these for active use, do not buy these for hard use.I wear size 11's and as of late, Pumas' and Adidas'size 11 offerings have been been fitting very narrow. I turned to these and I've been very happy with them. They have little arch support so I wouldn't suggest being too active in them (track running, tennis) but to wear out and about, they work well. And you have to love the retro styling (they were worn in the 1968 Summer Olympics held in Mexico City)."
1,Great style-- uncomfortable shoes,I love these shoes- design and style but fit and comfort- no ; feet hurt! returning cos my feet hurt!Asics please redesign the sole!
5,great price,The price is the lowest I found and also they sent the shoes the same day I put the order
3,"Great Look, kinda uncomfortable","I think these shoes look very european and unique. If you don't want your shoes to shout then these would not be the shoes for you. I did not like wearing them because while there is arch support, the rest of sole has poor support. I feel like I am walking on the cement. I think using orthotics may alleviate this issue. I personally returned these shoes because for the price I expect at least comfortable shoes."
4,Comfortable,Actual show is a little grayer than displayed in picture. Otherwise a good and comfortable shoe. Highly recommended for everyone.
2,Cheap,"I thought these shoes would be more comfortable, and felt like they were cheaply made. My heel falls off of the sole, and they hurt my feet. I may try a different pair and see if they are all the same, but didn't like this pair."
1,someone left their trash in the shoe box,"i was excited to receive this package because i read that the shoes were very stylish and comfortable. however, upon opening the box, someone left an empty can of diet pepsi in it. it was gross. not a happy customer."
1,didn't fit,Didn't fit and wasn't quite what I was expecting. Going to give them to my girlfriend's brother for xmas. Looking for a different style of Asics
2,Poor comfort,I have 3 pair of ultimate 81's. Two fit perfect and weirdly one is quite snug (all 10.5). These and another Tiger (I forget the model) also fit poorly at 10.5. I really hoped to be able to enjoy all of the Tigers. But unfortunately they don't all fit the same. 10.5 is the best size for me for the Mexico 66's. But they start to bother my big toes after 2-3 hours of wearing.
5,Asics Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66,Amazon made purchasing this product easy. I had a lot of trouble finding a company that would ship these shoes to Australia.The product was exactly what I wanted and shipment was less than a week. Fabulous!In future Amazon will be my first stop when buying anthing on the internet.
5,WONDERFUL SHOES!!! <3,"I love THEM!!!! :)Comfortable, stylish, unique.These shoes are what you expect, fancy, they look good with anything you wear, chinos jeans, shirts, polo shirts!"
4,Good Combination Average Quality,Here's the specs for the PYRAMID Pro 15 pc Home mechanic Tool Kit with case- Allen Wrench set (2mm-6mm)- Universal Chain Breaker- Shimano Lockring Remover- Chain Whip w/BB Spanner- Universal Crank puller-Fits Splined/Square Cranks- FW Remover for Falcon/Shimano- Universal BB Tool Fits Shimano or ISIS Splined BB and- Universal Spoke Wrench in caseJust the right set of tools I needed after having bought the other tools separately before.Not bad quality at all for the price I paid. however I'd not rate it as high as pedros/park/inline tools.
4,Great deal!,"It's a great beginners kit for everything you need for bike maintenance and installation.This has everything you need and they all have worked great so far.The only thing I was disappointed in was the chain breaking tool. It was very hard to use and not very well designed. After a few very crucial mistakes and nearly ruining my chain, I figured out how to deal with those problems and IT WORKS OKAY ONCE YOU FIGURE THAT OUT. (would suggest getting the parktool chain breaker, it's much better)Other than that I love it and definitely recommend it."
3,Not very many tools,"I just bought this and I can't say that it with worth the $50+ that I spent for it. It hasn't come in too helpful for repairing my bike's crank and removing the freewheel. When it arrived, I realized that I wasn't buying very many tools. I wish I had just spent $5 or $10 on the individual Park Tools specific for my job. I might add that I have primarily early 1980's bicycles - just to let you know how my opinion is biased."
5,Tool kit,Nice tool set in a solid case. like the clear front: makes for quick ID of contents on tool wall w/o opening.
4,worked for me,"There are so many variations of these tools depending on what year and model bike you have. This one worked for me, but make sure and research before you buy. Quality of tools is good enough for shade tree mechanic. Fixed my broken bike and was able to sell it for $500."
1,Worst designed product I ever bought!,Insert a Sony Pro Duo card and you cannot remove it without the aid of needle nose pliers or someone with really long fingernails!!!! Go ahead and buy one to see if you don't believe me. You would think they would have made a couple indented areas for FINGERS TO REMOVE THE MEMORY CARD!!...AHHHHH! This is going in the trash where the designers hopfully are.
2,Unreliable,"I bought this quite a while back as a cheap way to read my Sandisk Pro Duo cards... glitchy, unreliable. Half the time i'll have a card mounted on my Mac or PS3 and it will unmount and completely corrupt the data or just not read the card, totally useless most of the time. The cover never snaps all the way shut, it's junk. I wind up using my PSPGO to read and copy files over this trash."
4,card reader,"Does what I need it to do. A little hard to get the tiny Sony card out, but I don't know what I'd do without it."
4,Not a bad memory stick reader for the price,"Overall I like this card reader. It is certainly more resilient than the one it replaced. I would have given it 5 stars except for one annoying characteristic - it is very difficult to remove the memory stick. Ironically I did read about this problem before I purchased the reader, as it was mentioned by a earlier reviewer. I bought it anyway, thinking it might just be an isolated issue. It wasn't, and it can be very frustrating."
2,Very poor material quality,"Product works fine for some weeks, but the plastic outside is of very poor quality, so it broke after some time of usage.Better prefer:Sandisk MicroMate Reader-for Memory Stick"
1,Cheap,This reader is not worth the $$. When used with a MacBookPro the connection is very tenuous resulting in corrupt file transfers. Stopped using it. Now it just takes up space in the drawer
4,Great Product,"once i got it, i was ready to use it because i have a sony phone which uses a memory stick pro duo 2 gigsonce i opened the package, i was kind of confused on how to put the stick in, then i realized that it actually opened up like a clamshell, instead of sticking it into a slot like on most card readersit works perfect and transfer files pretty quicklythe only downside about it is that everytime i plug it in with my memory stick, it asks to scan for viruses and stuff, but i think its my memory stick, and not the reader"
4,IOGEAR Pocket Card Reader Supports Memory stick Pro Duo & Memory Stick Duo Cards (GFR202MSDW6),IOGEAR Pocket Card Reader Supports Memory stick Pro Duo & Memory Stick Duo Cards (GFR202MSDW6)I bought 2 of these as I travel a lot and it's handy for attaching pictures to my emails. However the catch for the compartment where the memory card is inserted is not very sturdy. I now have 2 of them with broken hinges on the catch but they still work great.
4,The Elmore Leonard segment,"The popular mystery writer Elmore Leonard makes his tenth or so appearance on Charlie Rose. He has with him a new book of stories , something a bit different from the small novels through which he has made his reputation. He also talks to Charlie Rose about his Ten Rules for Writing which are essentially 'ten rules for not writing' or perhaps more correctly 'Ten Rules for Writing like Elmore Leonard'. They essentially are rules for a minimalist kind of storytelling in which dialogue plays a central part. Leonard is a writer of great reputation in this area and speaks in a reasonable, competent way about his work."
4,Best Tarot Book I have read,Definitely the best book for learning Tarot have I read in a long time. Written exactly for beginners and makes the concepts clear. I really like the last chapter where it teaches the reading and spread concepts. I would always recommend this book to any level of Tarot learners.
3,"GOOD FOR A ""TOPICAL"" VIEW OF THE TAROT","This is a book for readers who do not desire to go deep into the tarot. Though it does describe each individual card, the meanings are vague and often leave you confused and wondering. This book is suited for intermidiate tarot readers with some experience. Do not buy this book as your first tarot book or you will undoubtly be left confused and kicking yourself over wasted money. The authors writing stlye is easy going and humourous but that in itself is simply not enough. A good attempt but a more thourough approach should have been taken."
5,A Must Have,"Mutants the Children of the Atom. This book has it all. Everything you ever wanted to know about those Uncanny Marvel Mutants. This Supplement to the Marvel Super Heroes RPG will give players a much needed referance to play anyone from Cyclops to my favorite Beast. Since this book is an expansion to the RPG you will need the other books to use this material.The book is categorized by team so all mutant entries will be found under there repective team. So buy and enjoy playing Wolverine and watch out for Sabertooth Huh (sniff ,SNIKT) hey bub bring it on."
2,NEVER AGAIN FROM THIS COMANY....,"First and only time I would order from this company. Even though transactions was within time frame for receiving an order, all of the ""right side"" pages of the book have the last line cut off, either completely missing or half or more of it missing. Looks like the company has this book in a PDF file format and sent it to a press to print/bind the book themselves. Will never do this one again..."
5,"Simple, pure... Beautiful Compositions","These tunes are ""hand-crafted"" by some of the best musicians alive today and is an album to be listened to from beginning to end, over and over."
4,Big Fan of Janet Dailey,"This is the 4th book in this series. It's nice to read a really good series with a good a storyline. Janet Dailey is a great author. I have most of her books.With this series being generational, one book leads into another. Each is as fascinating as the one before. Each, in their own turn, was hard for me to put down and kept me waiting to see what the next would bring. I thoroughly enjoyed this one for itself, and within the series."
4,Janet Dailey Fan,"I really enjoyed Calder Born, Calder Bred as a single book and as a generational series. Ty pretty much turned outlike to his father, Cal.For a series, Janet Dailey did a fantastic job. I have enjoyed all of her books in this series, as a series and as individual books.The research and knowledge she puts in her books about ranching is fantastic. I come from a farming community, as a young girl, and their were lots of ranches around us. She hit the nail on the head with the way the family career in ranching is done, or at least to the way it was done back then."
2,Too many misspellings,Good story but the typos drove me crazy! I spent a lot on this book to continue the story of the Calder family only to have so many misspellings that I lost count!
5,Outstanding Guide to Word-of-Mouth,"I've read numerous marketing books over the past five years. The Sercrets of Word-of-Mouth reallys stands out. It addresses perhaps the most powerful yet most overlooked (and least tapped) area of marketing. Few books or marketing courses outline or discuss word-of-mouth marketing as clearly as George Silverman does in his book. His easy to read book offers numerous recommendations on using word-of-mouth. While I already do some of the things recommended by Silverman, I gained valuable ideas on how to improve what I am currently doing and learned other strategies. I highly recommend this book."
2,Book is geared towards big companies...pass it on,"This book provides a functional introduction to the concept of word-of-mouth and what is sometimes called viral marketing. However, it definitely won't be the last book you'll need on the subject. The examples presented in the book mainly focus on larger companies with significant budgets. They also tend to have either established brands or established products. The products neatly fit into clear categories. In other words, any type of marketing campaign with a significant budget and well-written copy would have worked.Most small businesses without a large marketing budget or pre-established brand or product won't find much of this book relevant. I find this ironic since word of mouth is generally regarded as a method accessible to smaller businesses. If you work for Coke or Dell this book is for you. If you just started a new online business or small restaurant this book is probably not for you."
5,The Secrets of Word-of-Mouth Marketing by George Silverman,"As a marketing consultant to several financial services clients, I am constantly on the look-out for new ideas. Silverman has provided a new path -- far away from the Calf-Path trod for 300 years! Practical checklists - proven techniques. Can't wait to meet the author as a mentor, and continue to share new ideas. Excellent for academic coursework, too!"
2,"Not enough pracitcal steps, limited to a few industries, too much padding.","I just finished reading the book this morning and here are my thoughts.The book covers some important concepts like the importance of working out the steps in a customers decision process and is interesting to begin with, but towards the end of the book I really had to push myself to keep reading. Some books I simply can't put down, but this one I had to push myself to finish.This book talks about the importance of things, but doesnt give enough practical steps to put them into practice in different industries.I felt like this book was written as a promotional item for the author as opposed to a practical down to earth manual and there seems to be too much 'padding' and not enough practical steps.Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I read the book, but I dont feel like I could apply most of it to my business and I feel like the same content could have been put across in a book half the size."
1,Waste of Time,"I'm annoyed that I actually spent money on this book. It took the author 217 pages to write 10 pages of content AND it was boring.Get ""Anatomy of Buzz"" instead."
4,Good in general,"at first i was a bit disapointed,because the author sounds like he is exageretely trying to sell his book to your friends, and he says at least 100times that he is the first and the greatest and the...in the domain of word of mouth.i would have given the book 3 stars,if it didnt turn to the better, as he goes into more details about methods and principles of word of mouth.in the end he summarizes the main points in a remarcable way, and i actually learned a few things. he also provides a list of recommended reading.so: good book, useful information, easy to read, even if you could cut down about 50pages of rambling about how great word of mouth and the author is."
5,So far so excellent!,I am only a 1/4 of the way through this book but I had to write a review just to let people know how much I like this it. Silverman has a great flow to his writing style and his methodology is very authoritive and practical. He has organized his methods in an easy to follow guide including his theories and case studies. Everything is clear and easy to understand.I am a dreamer and a visionary and this book helps me to see clearly how my dreams are and will be increasingly fruitful.I will update this review when I'm done.I think you will be very pleased with this book.
2,"huge, parts missing...all plastic","it is mildly attractive, yet all plastic giving it a cheap feel..and even at 8bucks no real bargain. the paperwork mentioned a s-hook included so as to hang it...none there. i hate getting stuff with missing parts!this thing is huge! better have a lot of h-birds to suck up the juice, otherwise it will set there and turn bad. they even advise washing often...all the more so if that juice sits there for more than a few days in hot weather....i prefer our smaller feeder. we get 4 birds and the small one needs refilled every week. this thing would last a month, but then be filthy and raunchy inside.ADDENDUM....THIS THING LEAKS AT EACH AND EVERY OUTLET...A TOTAL WASTE!!! VERY DISAPPOINTEDi might ad, that the missing s-hook would be needed based on the weight. using some wire would be next best.i figure a 3 star as it is just sort of average....the pic looks better than fact. had i seen it, well iffy then of we'd have bought...certainly not at the 11buck price."
1,Good product,"This is a nice product, shipped well, received in record time and good item. Would recommend."
3,DENTS!,Ordered two trays and was happy they seemed sturdy but disappointed they were both dented. Not sure if they were sent that way with where the dents were located or poor packaging for shipping.
4,Almost Complete,"The book overall is fabulous! It contains every song in the show, with accompaniement piano and vocal. I was trying out for The Music Man, but the director wouldn't hand out tryout music until a week before. Being a musical enthuisiast and wishing to begin practicing immediately, I ordered this book and had it shipped express. It arrived the next day, to my satisfaction. I didn't make the lead, but I got into the show when few my age did. I only wish the libretto was included."
2,Not Detailed Enough,"I realize that this is supposed to be an introductory book, however it does not provide enough detail to be very useful in my 2nd year inorganic chem class. I am extremely disappointed by this since the book costs so much money. I wonder how much more it would cost if it was hardcover.It does have a good layout and bright pictures and colors though. I guess this is supposed to stimulate the brain or something."
5,Excellent Inorganic Textbook,"There are many insufficient inorganic textbooks out there, but Housecroft is not one of them. With the easy to follow, but in depth discussions and lots of practice questions this is a great inorganic book for anyone learning inorganic chemistry. Very recommended!"
3,Inorganic chem text,"Speaking as a student, this inorganic chem book doesn't do the best job of explaining the concepts in an easily learn-able way. However, the scope of content covered is very wide."
4,Book,This book is nice to have. It works well as a good resource and explains the information pretty well. Just nice to have a backup and another reference.
5,DuraPet is for your pets,"I've used DuraPet bowls for years, and they are great. They stand up to just about everything, and always look like they did whenyou first purchased them. One of my cats is crazy about water, and loves the mirror finish on the bottom. It allows her to watch the movement of the water in the bowl. If in doubt, just give one a try and you will be a believer."
3,Alum researchers,"Although entitled ""Manufacture of alum & the sulphates of Alumina and Iron"" it is not an historical account of the alum and copperas industries - more a contemporary account of the processes in use in the latter half of the nineteenth century. After saying that, I was very pleased to find it on a charity bookstall for 50p - I havent seen another copy on the market. For the serious alum student it is an essential component of the primary material available - otherwise go for one of the secondary sources."
2,The only thing missing is Godzilla !,"Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations in a ridiculous story including a submarine,terrorists,the evil dead,and the lamest hero that you will ever come across.Otherwise,an outstanding read.Oh,and God helps out too."
4,Excellent Page Turner,This was a great read which was very hard to put down. You keep reading because you are so caught up in the story and wanting to know what happens next. Pick up this book and begin to read. You will not be sorry that you did.
3,Unrealistic,"The story was good and plot gripping. But one thing I thought was unrealistic about ""A Ship Possessed"" was the fact that Stanton was able to fight off what was possessing the ship although he was admitted to not going to church often and only a few times we heard that he believed in God. It's hard to ignore that he wasn't a strong Christian but was able to fight off all these evil spirits. The book would have been much better if Stanton had a better relationship with Jesus."
4,"great harmony, great voices",The harmony and voice blend is extroadinary and their ability to begin and end phrases exactly together is mind boggleing. The two albums have very different styles of songs so there will be some you don't like as well as others you love but overall terrific.
5,African Origins of the Masonic Order,"Did the Knowledge of the Craft Originate in Africa? This is a great book all Black Freemasons should read it! We all know about Worshipful Prince Hall, but why did he become a mason?Why do white Masons segregate from black Masons? This book answers not only the Masonic Question,but the real esoteric purpose for separation of the race in the Order. It goes into great detail about the Masonic Orders origin in Africa, and how Europeans received it. GOOD BOOK. It deals with figures such as Marcus Garvey, Noble Drew Ali, Elijah Muhammad, and there knowledge of the origin of masonic knowledge and origins."
4,brillant,It was interesting to learn alot about the African culture that was hidden for years. There are alot of other sources to learn the truthabout Africa. But this book is a must have.
5,A MUST OWN BOOK FOR COLLECTORS,"I was very impressed with Mr. Louis Kuritzky's 1998 ""Collector's Guide to Bookends"" I didn't think a collector's guide could be improved until I recently purchased the 2006 ""Collector's Encyclopedia of Bookends"" Mr. Kuritzky teamed up with Charles De Costa, and together they compiled a wonderful, detailed book on hundreds of varieties of bookends many rare ones included. I love it, this book has it all, it is all you need to know about bookends. After all, that is what the book is about."
4,"Versitile, good choice, not best for home use.","This printer has excellent quality, features and can do just about any task you send it. The stackable trays are great for different types of jobs. I have had the printer for 3 years and have not had to change the toner yet. I do use it for home business only, this printer is pretty heavy and takes up a lot of space for home use.I trust HP quality and know this printer will outlive many similar models.The printer driver settings are easy to use, but the menu options on the printer itself are hard to navigate and save.If you do consider this printer, buy additional memory for it, because the 8MB internal memory is not enough for many jobs, and is quite slow. 64MB will be plenty for about 40 bucks more."
3,Inconsistent product,"I have been using this product to give my hair texture for styling for years, and I seriously LOVE it...when I get a good jar of it. Some jars are far too watery which causes my hair to be limp and lifeless. Other jars are so thick and full of the fibers it is extremely difficult to spread it through your hair. If Tresemme could make every jar be a ""good"" jar, I would buy 1000 of them and stockpile it! Now that it is not available in stores near me, I will find a replacement product b/c the inconsistency makes it not worth ordering."
1,I hate this book,"I am a student and I spent $120 for this book because it was required for my class. I am now having to find other books because this one is so difficult to use. Yes, almost every page has a pretty color graphic, but I would definitely have preferred more black+white images and clearer, less obtuse explanations. I will not keep this book in my library - as soon as class is over, I will be getting rid of this book."
5,give a broader perspective as regards the database technolog,This book is neither an idiot or dummy type teach yourself booklet nor an empty academic exercise but rather a general approach that tries to give a broader perspective as regards the database technology.
4,sportsmansguide has excellent products,"i am married to a hunter, and my step son hunts also. we have purchased several products that have come from sportsmansguide.com and each product so far has been high quality, well made and have done what they are meant to do! these chest waders were bought for my step son and he is a good sized young man. the chest waders fit him great! and has the clip belt with it. he especially liked the broad shoulder straps also."
4,not what i expected!,"My friend has been painting models using these, but i was using a different type of marker. This marker started off being horrendous, I had no idea how to use it. But after a little experimenting (I did this on an assembled model I did not like), I understood the way to use these markers perfectly, and they work wonders! If you mess up, you can just scratch the paint off. It's WONDERFUL for detailing those slightly indented panel lines, however for painting large scale I highly recommend spray paint. This paint lasts a while, but be careful, if applied incorrectly, it won't look smooth and on top of that it can be scratched off fairly easily. Otherwise, it's AMAZING for panel lining, and painting areas that won't be touched!"
3,Modelling With AutoCAD 2002,"I had just received this book from the post a few days ago. After fliping thru' the contents, the following are my sincere comments:1. It is well written and easily understood by those with experience but not to the novice of the subject.2. It is a solid practical approach which should be useful for those who wants to further their knowledge and experience in 3D modelling.3. Only complain is that the author should have a diagramatic approach of the lessons to cater for new starters of the subject."
5,Fine tape!,This has completely fulfilled my (rather high) expectation. It will do the same for you. The shade of orange depicted is also quite accurate.
5,Great for very dry feet!,You don't have to be pregnant to appreciate this product. It is wonderful for extra dry cracked feet and has a light scent that is very soothing. A little goes a long way and the results are amazing!
5,Great Movie for those who love to surf!,"This is a great movie with many of the world top surfers boosting serious air. Includes Andy Irons, Taj Burrow, and Wade Goodall among others and many top surf spots around the world. A great surfing video by Billabong"
4,"ER, The X-Files and Robin Cook all rolled into one.","I caught this show on the Independent Film Channel last night and was blown away by it. This kind of programming could NEVER be made in the U.S. I alternately laughed and cringed. From the ghost of a little girl to the most disgusting childbirth scene ever, I couldn't believe my eyes. I almsot wished that I could have watched it without the subtitles because this is one film you need to concentrate on 100%. I can't wait to see The Kingdom II."
3,Over-rated,"Not a bad TV series (because of its taboo-breaking nature, it'd never play in the States!), but the pacing starts to break down in the 2nd part. Also, the patronizing use of mentally-handicapped actors as kind of a Greek chorus starts to wear thin. An interesting story that never quite comes to a boil..."
1,Farcical Drama,"Compared to other ""haunted hospital"" films that I've come across, this one is way too farcical. As a result, there is an excess of absurdity and very little believability, which seriously detracts from any potiential entertainment value. The jumpy hand-held camera action didn't help any either. Subtitled from original Danish."
3,Not a great effort,"Unlike other reviewers,I don't think highly of this program. Cheap effects, B-movie acting, scares that don't scare for the most part, and humor that is more likely to make you shake your head than your belly all come together in one long tedious bore (I like my film metaphors entertaining. This is supposed to be an Entertainment first and foremost isn't it?). BUT I did watch all four episodes (it is Von Trier after all) and was sufficiently left by the final minutes wanting to see the second Season. I rate this a 2 but the ending bumps it up to 2.5."
3,"It was OK, I guess","But nowhere near as good as Stephen King's version,Kingdom Hospital. The Kingdom was rather ponderous,while Kingdom Hospital is lighter and had more humor.I enjoy subtitled movies, so it wasn't due to the language.I liked the photography style, but the movie just took itselftoo seriously. What humor it had was too ""set up"" and studied.Not natural and flowing like Kingdom Hospital.I haven't seen Kindom II, maybe that will be better. Thereviews seem to agree that II is better than Kingdom I."
5,Tongueincheek,"This TV show is not supposed to be surreal. It is a tongue-in-cheek soap opera with overtones of the fantastic and horrific. It is visually stunning with some very humorous exchanges between the characters. Listen to Lars Von Trier at the end of every episode--it's really funny, pointed stuff. It also, at the same time, mulls over some very serious issues concerning the limits of science, the sanctity of life and the role of the spiritual realm in, and contrasted to, the sciences. Don't listen to the nay-sayers: they confuse genres so easily with glib remarks that underscore their ignorance."
5,Worth the Four and one-half hours...,"This gleefully demented epic fills a void for viewers like me: not since Dead- Alive has the movie-going public been blessed with such an intense and apocalyptic vision. It's certainly more than a horror film, but with the Horror genre leaning towards mainstream, watered-down formulae like Scream and The Faculty, perhaps we should be looking elsewhere for truly imaginative film-making. And for my money, this is the best place to start."
5,"we all want the dvd, right?","I am writing this just to add my voice to the choir of the ones wating for the dvd... Lars you rock, you are the man!"
5,The quality surprised me!,"I bought this ping pong paddle just so I would qualify for free shipping on my order because it was only 5 bucks, but when I got it in the mail I was surprised at how nice it was for only 5 dollars. It also comes with a nice sleeve to protect it."
2,riddled with syntax errors,"Thank God for the libertybasic group in groups.yahoo.com otherwise I would have given up before I even started! This book is full of editing/syntax errors. Just to name the first several... Pg 84, 106, 121-123, 133-135...Trying to learn programming with this book is difficult because you are typing in these error-ridden examples and wondering why they aren't working. Fortunately, ITS NOT YOU POOR READER."
2,A lot harder than it should be...,"I'd like to start off by saying I'm only about 1/2 way through the book. I keep having trouble with the examples he puts in the book. It's taking me a lot more time and effort trying to correct his mistakes than actually learning the concepts. I feel as if these examples should have been more thoroughly checked. It would have saved me a lot of trouble, anyway. Other than this, though, the book is very good at explaining the concepts and very funny, as well."
3,"OK, but...","Beginning Programming for DUMMIES by W. Wang is not all it's cracked up to be. It starts off very good, giving concise examples on how to program using Liberty BASIC. However, from the middle and towards the end the sample programs fall apart. On several examples I had to find the correct answers on the internet (by joining the Liberty Basic Yahoo group). However, if a person has never programmed anything before, this is a good book to start. But be warned that it does require some outside reference."
1,Do Not Purchase this book,To all potential purchaser's of this book; beware the CD that is so prominently mentioned on the cover and is heavily referenced throughout the content of the book as being a helpful aid in allowing a user to work thru examples within the book IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED by the software company. In essence the CD is worthless which in turn makes this book worthless.
1,Accompanying CD wouldn't work: Trojan Virus,"After purchasing this book to teach myself beginning programming, I was excited to jump right in and get started; however, the CD wouldn't work in my computer because my virus scanner detected a Trojan virus in its programs. I restarted my computer and started the CD directly from my Start menu as an administrator but was still stopped by my scanner because of the virus. I am very disappointed at this and will be returning my copy to the local bookstore where I bought it.I did some research on google and found that another book, Java for Dummies, also includes a CD that people have complained about for having a Trojan virus. I'd just like to draw attention to this as it's rediculous that books about programming have viruses within their supplemental CDs."
3,Marginal at best,"The book does a very good job of explaining the basics in the beginning. I was able to get past his syntax errors by seeing enough code prior. However, The entire book appears to be put together half heartedly, so overall it seems to come up short."
2,Not impressed,"The book has a couple of strong points. First, it is truely designed with the beginner in mind. It's easy to read. Far from technical. QBASIC software is built into Windows, so it's accesible to anybody with a PC. And it gives the reader a look at other programming languages which he/she would hopefully want to move on to after completion of this book.Lots of weak points: The mistakes in the authors programming examples were abundant. He spent much of the book teaching QBASIC (a language few people will ever productively use except for recreational purposes). My opinion,beginners wanting to learn programming for recreation would be better off learning HTML (which is covered moderately in the book) which has some productive value. Finally, the author is trying too hard to be funny. Granted his bio states he wants to be a stand-up comedian, but it didn't work for me while reading an intro-technical computer book."
2,Okay but don't expect to be a real programmer,"Not too bad, however there are some glaring problems. For example, one of the hardest things for a beginner to understand is recursion. This topic should rate a whole chapter near the start. Instead, the term is only mentioned ONCE in the entire book and only as a passing remark in a discussion about quick sorts. Outrageous! The best thing about the book is the choice of QBASIC for the examples."
1,Programming For Dummies,"Like Most ofThe Dummies books, the author is long on nonsense and short on helpful information. I am certainly glad I was able to buy the book used at a very modest price.The book I received was used and was in very nice condition."
5,A Great Book for Learning Programming from Scratch,"First of all, every sample program in this book ran perfectly for me except for one (at the bottom of p. 264), and the JavaScript programs at the very end (for some reason, JavaScript did not work on the system I was using). Everything else - hundreds of examples - worked great, and required no reference to any outside source. The quality of the 'Dummies' books is variable, but this one is a winner. It is very well organized, and answered a lot of questions I have had about general programming for years, clearly and concisely. Wang is not only a talented programmer. He is a talented programmer who can communicate effectively to a general (but serious) audience, in English. The sample code is very clear and illustrates the topics under discussion beautifully. This is a great book for learning about programming in general, from scratch."
1,Useless if you really want to learn,"I bought the expanded with the 7 books in one reference and I mean it was only reference and a lot of stupid yuppie jargon and really did not understand it..., till I went online on free info and training in HTML HTML5 PYTHON ect...... I waited 3 weeks for the book and paid $ 27.00 with the so-called fast 7 day shipping. I learn more online than the damn Book.....the book is for nerds ..,not Dummies that are not hip too this World of programming..... Thank God for the internet !!!"
1,"disappointing, beware","I have purchased maybe half a dozen ""Dummies"" books and have been very happy with them. This one I am not happy with. Beware, the book says that the included CD is compatible with the XP operating system, but it is not. I contacted the company about it and they suggested I download Liberty Basic from their website, for an extra $30. No thanks. That's one of the reasons I bought the book - for a working CD. They ought to either adjust the disk so it is compatible, or not claim that it is."
4,Not bad at all,"A good overall explanation of programming in general. Becoming proficient in any of the languages taught, I think, will require additional reading. However, the basic concepts and building blocks of programming are well laid out for the reader. A great starter for someone with no experience in programming."
2,Too general to be truly useful,"This book introduces you to overall concepts related to programming, and thus may be useful as a secondary text or as a general introduction to ""issues you'll encounter when you actually start programming""...but as a primary guide, it didn't do much to help me get started. Having used this book, I'm now more familiar with terms and ideas and, to some extent, the lay of the programming land, but I still need a book that functions more like a text book: let's start at the beginning and get you writing some basic programs...not just talk about concepts in generalities."
3,Good start but weak toward the end,"Mr. Wang's book is a good primer to learn PC programming. The book does a great job explaining the differences between programming languages. However, toward the middle, the book does a dissapointing job in explaining the capabilities of Liberty Basic. The first edition did a better job with Q Basic. I would have prefered more in depth coverage of Liberty Basic functions.For example, the chapter on arrays was too brief."
2,Too many mistakes,"I typically like the dummies books for introductions into subjects. For basic concepts, this book does very well. However, the programming language examples are in a couple different forms of BASIC, C++ and a mac compiler.I don't know if it's the book itself or the accompanying cd, but NONE of the C++ programs work properly. I've been forced to try and learn how to correct some of the most basic mistakes off of the internet, but it has really hampered my ability to learn this programming language, especially as the programs get more complex.This is the 4th and most recent addition. I would assume that enough sales to quantify four iterations would qualify this book for a technical editor, not just someone with a firm grasp of English.Wiley Publishing, please stop making computer study aids edited by people that don't understand the technical terms and programs. I've wasted hours just trying to figure out what's wrong instead of actually LEARNING."
3,Get the newest edition!,"Unfortunately I have a copy of this book published in 1999.There are many errors. I'm no programmer but I know you can't name the same variable 2 different ways [mynum% vs number%] and expect the program to work. Those typos -and the : instead of ; typos - I can fix. Some of the others my newbie self can't figure out.I was enjoying working my way through the book until I got to Chapter 12 where the errors were just too much to cope with!I'm guessing if you have a newer edition you'll be fine, don't buy the older editions unless you like to solve mysteries."
5,A GREAT GOSPEL CD,"It is wonderful to know that they still have Mahalia Jackson's recordings in a Vault somewhere. When are they going to release the other recordings. I can't wait!!!! The song on this recording called ""Lord don't let me fail"" is a great hit!!! You can almost see yourself in a live concert with the Queen of Gospel music. Mahalia is still the Queen of Gospel on this CD. I can't hardly believe that she has been gone from this earth for almost 30 years. It seems like yesterday that Mahalia was singing over the radio or TV. Again, I would like to thank the record companies for releasing this great music collection of a fantastic singer. There are no words to describe the feelings and excitement that Mahalia brings to this Gospel tradition. She can sing anything. The song ""Lord don't let me fail"" brings out the Mahalia swing like no other song. I recommend this music very highly!!!!!"
2,Nothing but doom and gloom,"I remember earlier sci fi collections having stories with a variety of outcomes; positive and negative. There's nothing uplifting in this collection. Makes me wonder if the the writers and the judges are all a bunch of depressed souls. Unless you're looking for that last book to read before you off yourself, I'd skip this one."
2,there are much better third person shooters,"With being a huge fan of final fantasy, this game just doesnt belong in the genra. They say its an RPG shooter, but its just a third person shooter in which I found devil may cry to be a much more injoyable game. So if you like games like devil may cry, you might like this. Otherwise if your into Final Fantasy and RPG, I wouldnt recommend this."
4,Fun but short game!,If you love Vincent and you like shooters and would like to know more of the side story of Jenova this game would be right up your alley. The game is a little dark in coloring but its shooter action game . My only negative thing I would have to say is that this game is really short . I finished this in 3 days ( no not 72 hours or even 24) I played for a few hours each day. But aside from that its a nice game with good controls.
1,I don't like this game,I like being able to save frequently and often and you can't do either with this game. Some people can't devote all day to play this game. I gave it away to a friend who can devote time to this game that I can't afford...
3,I can't put my finger on it.,"This game is different from the final fantasy formula. Your just playing as Vincent Valentine, and their is nothing wrong with it. I was just expecting to play with Cloud and Tifa again, but this was still an interesting experience.Pros1. The story was interesting, but felt like an extra long dlc content for the orginal game.2. I like the expansion of Vincent character in this game.Cons1. The game is very short, and you only play with Vincent.2. The enemies are dumb, and the boss fights are way too easy.3. I would have rather known more about Barret pass then vincent future in FF VII, but beggars can't be chosers I guess.Overall this is okay to be honest, but don't play this game expecting FF VII your dreams will be shattered. I went into this open-minded, and felt good after I beat this on a weekend game fest. 6.5/10.Game on my Fellow Gamers."
5,novice gamer loved this game!,This is my first shooter game. You have to use both the right and left control sticks together. (that gave me a bit of grief! ha!) I am not sure why this game didn't get better reviews because I have really enjoyed it. I am a 42 and just started gaming about a year ago. I never got stuck anywhere and couldn't figure out how to continue the game... so that also made me happy. I am playing it on the normal setting. The hard setting might be different... but why make things harder if you don't have to? HA! I would recommend this game fo $20.
3,For loyal FF7 fans only,"I've only just started the game, and am unsure of what the outcome will be. It is different from the normal Final Fantasy game, as it isn't a typical turn-based game, but a mission based ""shooter"" type. I'm not usually a fan of shooters, and so far I'm not overly impressed, but I love Vincent Valentine so I picked it up. The opening movie was fantastic, and hopefully the rest of the game will be as good."
3,"Meh... watch ""Advent Children"" instead.","I don't blame Nomura-san for not wanting to direct the game. The original game and ""Advent Children"" were much better, and this was...just OK.GAMEPLAY: 5/10: WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too easy. I beat the game in 3 days. Some nice action and CG cut scenes, but It was way too short.GRAPHICS: 9/10: Some cut scenes have amazing CGI, and the game graphics are good too.WEAPONS: 4/10: A real bummer. Vincent's weapons are less capable of anything, and some you can't use materia.SOUND: 5/10: 5 for the sound effects, 5 taken off for the dialouge.MUSIC: 10/10: Spectacular. Plus, ""Longing"" and ""Redemption"" are spectacular.OVERALL: 4.5/10: A real dissapointment.So rent it, but don't believe the hype. Not worth buying."
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I got this on the basis of it being a Final Fantasy Game. I was Disappointed to find out it was a FPS and not a RPG. I guess FPS games are Ok, I'm just not big on them. That having been said, The graphics are good as well as the story. The sound is good as well. I had to give it two stars only because it was a FPS. If you are a fan of FPS type games then you will enjoy this one. As for me, it will be going to the used game store, as I won't be playing it. Charlie S."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a game like Final Fantasy XII. This is more of a one person, role playing, shoot 'em up. It is cool. The graphics are pretty good. But it is not what I was looking for."
1,Unfortunate Gaming.,"As was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for. They gave us Advent Children, cell phone games, and finally Dirge of Cerberus. This game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under-used and least interesting character in the Final Fantasy Series. Its the creators way of telling us that they will never re-make Final Fantasy VII but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man."
3,Worst music ever,"I still think it's a great ""shooter"" game, especially when compared with other shooter games. But since it's an FF game...it kinda sucked. Making this game a shooter game isn't the problem. Graphics are still great, but too few CGs. Music sucks the most, there was pretty much nothing orchastrated, just some idiot called Gackt singing some Jpop. And it sucks even more when you compare the orchastration, and the theme songs from previous FFs, like FF 8, 10, x-2, which had amazing music compositions. Music is a big disappointment."
4,Great game!,"I loved this game, it was really fun for me. It's a wonderful shooter with good controls. I liked the having a Final Fantasy game that was a shooter and I love the character of Vincent Valentine. However, if you don't like cut scenes then I'd stay away. It's full of 'em and some of them are pretty dang long.-Emma Easterly"
3,Decent but not great.,The game is ok. It really fails to reach anything spectacular. The only thing thats really good about the game is the storyline which is something Square Enix knows a lot about. Another part that is good is the weapon customization element and it is pretty cool addition to the game and I wished more 3rd person action games had this feature.The game is at decent length and I think most people would find it adequate. Controls are responsive enough and are easy enough to pick up and play. The interface is a little bland and menu driven. Sound is standard. Graphics are good but the level design is linear and generic looking. The challenge is good enough but sometimes I felt like I was at a shooting gallery instead of taking on some baddies. The game is far from being bad. It just has a been there done that feel you can see in other games. Basically get this game for the story because thats what this game excels at.
4,Not as bad as people say,"They're right. This is not the best game in the world, but people complain to much. Just because its name has final fantasy on it, they expect amazing things.This is a good game, it's entertaining and has an amazing graphics and story.Gameplay is a little off but its not that bad.If you love vincent and final fantasy vii story, you should buy it"
4,Short and sweet!,"I thought I was getting a FF RPG (yes I got it because of the FF name), but this is a 3rd person shooter, and I was really bummed at first, but I thought since I paid for it I should try it out. WOW, this was a really fun game, it was a great break from RPG(s) and I had a blast with it! It's challenging but not that hard, has a good story and plays in about 12 hours or so. Enjoy!"
5,Love it,"We love the warm mediteranian vibes of this lady's deep voice and have more than one of her cd's. This one does not disappoint,"
5,Verdaderos clasicos,"Este CD lo había buscado durante mucho tiempo. Tenía algunos de los temas en formato LP de vinilo, pero ahora están remasterizados y suenan mejor que nunca.Musica de todos los tiempos, muy recomendable para aquellos que tengan excelente gusto."
4,Your liking for the record grows as you play it.,Like her singing style. Her music and style grows on you as you replay the selections on this CD.
4,"Definitely brings back memories!,Lukky13","This a compilation that's good to have in your collection, it'll bring you back memories. A classic! Lukky13"
5,Superb!,"The little known Spanish Foreign Legion forged a well deserved reputation for valor and professionalism during Spain's early 20th century struggle in North Africa. Unfortunately, very little has been written in English about this extraordinary force. Dr. Alvarez has written a superb account of the formation and early history of the Legion capturing the unique Spanish elan of both its leaders and men. Here was a tough, truly elite military force in the best Spanish tradition. This book fills an important gap in military history which I hope will encourage other historians to explore the role the Legion played later during the Civil war."
5,"A home wine maker's ""bible""","I'm a home wine maker - strictly an amateur who loves making wine. This publication is only 34 pages long, but invaluable for the dedicated (didn't say EXPERT) home winemaker. Dont let the 30+ year publishing date deter - there's nothing like this ""wine makers cook book."" I've used it for various grape, pear, apple, strawberry, and tomato wines. So far, I have not been steered wrong. Like any cookbok, the cook adds his or her own ideas. And so, with this I have done so as well. For a small fee (i.e. purchase price), it's a resource I go back to through the year, and year after year. Cheers all!"
2,cardboard oreo alternative,Horrid. I give it two stars only because it gave my oreo loving son an alternative. I'm make my own from now on.
1,pied piper of reflexivity,"Soros's intention in funding left-wing groups such as moveon.org is to allow their message to dominate the democratic party's platform thus creating a backlash from the voters and ensuring the victory of pro-market forces which should lead to more freedom,prosperity,ecological realism,and peace.But when dealing with reflexivity everything is illusion so maybe he has an actual plan for a society that restricts freedom more then ours but is somehow more ""open""."
2,A terrible Miss-assesment,"In 1898 Mr Soros would have predicted a `bubble' and he would have predicted the same `bubble' in 1945 and he would have been wrong both times just like he is now. Mr. Soros whose home country of Czecheslovakia was twice saved by America, first from the Nazis and then the Communists, is now whining about American power in this weak account. This book assaults America and the `bush doctrine' and the criticism is `how dare America defend itself against terrorism'. This false account attacks American policy of confronting terror because secretly this book is pro terror. Its pathetic how someone can write a book attacking the very country whose liberal economic policies allowed them to a massive fortune. Had Mr. Soros grown up in Saudi or Communist Russia he would still be a penniless peasant but he is now using the very money American capitalism allowed him to speculate on to attack the hand that feeds. A terrible miss-assessment."
3,A businessman's take on the neocons,"Critiques of the neoconservatives often come from liberals, journalists, environmentalists, and pacifists. This is one of the few from a dedicated businessman. Drawing upon the history of other once powerful nations such as the Soviet Union, Soros gives his opinion on how and why the US is powerful. He then explains why he thinks this nation is more powerful than it should be, or is taken to be. He describes how recent actions by the US is creating enemies and impoverishing other countries in the world. He then lays out a series of proposals that the US should implement to help the poorer countries in the world. Overall, this book's ideas are not new, though the author is. It is a short and easy read, and worth the time."
5,I am new to marvel but this thing ROCKS!!!!!!!!!,I am new to marvel but this thing rocks!!!!!!!!non exageration this is my first in my entire marvel collection and beleive me because of tis bad boy it will be a collection.First of all the detail is better than any toy I have ever owned I love that it can bend alot really for me the only problem is that sometimes if you put some pressure his left arm will fall off but my favorite is the guns BOOMBOOMPOWPOW!!!!!!Well anyways ROCK ON AND ROCK HARD!!!!!!!!
2,"Very Fragile, but nice looking","This toys hand fell off within two minutes of light play. We glued it on and it broke then the other hand did the same thing. And finally, the leg popped off at the knee. We returned it. The cape is fun and flexible. The color is good."
2,catherine could have done better,"i don't hate this book... it's a book i would call in between.. itz just that itz not one of catherine's best.. the age between the two lovers was so huge, i was shocked.. the guy was like 16 when that girl was born... seriously.. wowee.. one advice to catherine in romance stories: never let the women be older than the men... and if the man is going to be older than the girl.. then please make not such a long period... thanks~!! i take much pleasure from reading your books~!!"
4,A really fun & exciting read,"I think Catherine Coulter's Aftershocks is a good read. I read the whole thing in a matter of hours and I have read it through 2 more times since then! I think George and Elliot were great characters and I laughed with them got annoyed with them and felt like I knew them really well at the end. I would really recommend this book, although I didn't think much of Afterglow!! The follow on book. Although it was interesting to see how Elliot & George were getting on!!"
5,ONE OF HER BEST!!!,"Right From the beginning you have to love Georgina ""George"" Hathaway, and Elliot Mallory. This book kept me turning pages untill three in the morning when I finished it!! I'm probably one of her youngest fans (16), and found this book her second best. (""The Heir"" being her first) So if you feel the need to sit back and enjoy one of the best books ever written, get this one and relax. You won't be able to put it down."
3,"A good book, but author's no Fabio","Aftershocks is a pretty good book, but doesn't quite measure up to the romantic fiction currently being turned out by the masters of the genre, such as Fabio. For one thing, too much time is spent on the protagonist, not enough on the antagonist. And given that one of the characters is a 38 year old man, I think a more sensitive treatment of the subject of hair loss would have been in order. Also, the book would have been more interesting if the protagonist had been a pirate or exiled prince or something more interesting."
3,Powerfinder 2000 - This is an upgrade ?,Previous versions were much faster and user friendly. Since Info USA bought the product the cost has gone up and the performance has gone down. Network prices are outrageous. This was a five star product two years ago.
5,"Real history, by a great automotive historian","Books like this one are rare. A technological history that is fully cognizant of the times and the state of the world and how all of that affected the final product. And the product, in this case, was one that changed the world. An astounding piece of research, and a book to read, enjoy, and read again."
3,"Light, but pricey","This very light, portable projector is perfect for small conference rooms. It is easy to set up and connects in a snap to your laptop. Don;t leave home without it, if you can afford it!"
3,minnie mouse,"Teresa Brewer's squeaky minnie mouse voice leaves me cold.It's amazing to me she has made so many albums.The Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands are excellent on this cd.Too bad Kay Starr wasn't the singer here.The audio fidelity reproduction is not very good.This is a budget lable and it sounds thay way.Probably a good cd to purchase if you're a rabid Teresa Brewer fan,otherwise forget it."
5,Great for Excelsior's Research Methods in Psych test....,"Although I never ended up taking the test myself, several people advised me to buy this book, which in fact is the recommended textbook listed on the content outline for the ECE Research Methods test. After skimming though it, it appears to cover what is on the test (according to the outline). But get a used copy, unless you want to pay $100+ for a new one."
5,The woman's book of yoga and health,"I love this book! It was recommended to me by my yoga instructor and I am really pleased I took her advice. The book contains chapters and sections dedicated to different issues women face through their lifetime. The book is divided into chapters and sections that address different issues, and the suggested sequences are well described and illustrated and very achievable. I particularly like the way the poses are offered in sequences as in the past I have had difficulty deciding in what order to practice poses at home. The illustrations and instructions for each pose are very clear, and an explanation of the effects and benefits of each pose is included. Overall, a great book and one I believe I will continue to use for many years. My 18 year old daughter and 25 year old niece have also been reguarly reading and using the book."
5,A must-have,"As a long time practioner of Pilates, a relative newcomer to traditional yoga, and a woman who has, and will, experience some of the health issues, I found this book a great source of reference. What I found most useful, aside from Patricia's yoga poses & Linda Sparrowe's easy-to-read writing style, are the suggested herbal & dietary alternatives throughout the book. Not only do I have a copy, I bought one for all my closest girlfriends!! This book is a definate must-have in any woman's bookcase!!"
5,a guide for women that works,"I teach yoga in a high school and also in a private studio. The majority of my students are female and I have found this book to be a wealth of information. I have developed a curriculum that meets the needs of all my women, from teens with PMS to seniors with arthritis. No, you don't need to invest in lots of props, pillows, blankets, men's ties, all these work in lieu of (purchasing) props. I have seen how my students have come to appreciate and respect their bodies. Thank you Linda and Patricia."
3,"Informative, but....","Be prepared to spend alot of money on props. I understand that having two bolsters and a special backless chair enables people to adapt to their abilities and add to the restorative qualities of yoga. But unless you are prepared to make that much of an investment in equipment or already know how to do the poses without props (or are good at improvising with blankets, etc.), this book is not for you. It seemed that more than 75% of the poses in every sequence were demonstrated with props."
1,Does Not Work,"I ordered this to replace the old stopper for a Whirlaway 191. The shipping charge is ridiculous but I was willing to pay it just to get this ""impossible to find"" part. Unfortunately this part DOES NOT WORK. It is not a valid replacement. I'm glad I only ordered one -- which went directly into the trash since it isn't worth returning and I will never recover the almost 7.00 I paid for shipping."
1,Too Small for my Whirlaway,This was a great price so I bought two! Be careful when ordering as it was too small. I bought white rubber ones that come in a pack of different sizes for about $2 and one of them fits down in the disposal so now I can use my sink as a sink!! Postage was very expensive and many times the cost of the product!
1,NO STARS! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"The EZ-Flo ""stoppers"" [sic] are NOT valid replacements for the original stopper lid that came with the Whirlaway disposal. These parts are advertised as perfect fits, fully functional replacement parts for the Whirlaway garbage disposal... However, when trying one of them out, water would not hold in the sink and drained out instead in a matter of seconds, a total contradiction to the concept of a ""stopper."" It's not merely to provide a cover over the disposal, it SHOULD make an adequate seal and keep water within the sink. However, your cheap ""EZ-Flo"" stopper [sic] FAILS. I want to return these worthless parts that don't deliver what they promise AND obtain a FULL refund on the parts AND the exorbitant shipping fee (that cost more than the parts--It's ridiculous that a reasonable choice of shipping methods isn't proffered... the USPS would've been much more economical.)"
2,The tone of the writing determined my low score,"One thing I observed almost immediately in this book, is what I would describe as a ""strong-arm"" temperament by the writer concerning ecclesiastical authority. Kind of a ""obey me, your supreme and holy superior, or suffer the consequences"" undertone within the writing which I found as a consistent irritant.If one can get past the somewhat harsh, cold and clinical tone of the writing, one can glean some information tid-bits... such as the 12 primary names within the Pauline servant-group, and the listing of Greek words which Paul used to describe them functionally. (e.g. Diakonos, synergos etc) which peaked my interest for a further focused study.For a book you might find as informational without the ""dark-ages"" tone, I would refer you to F.F. Bruce ""The Pauline Circle""ISBN 0853643970Bruce, in MHO comes closer to touching the warmth of Paul's heart.The tone of this book is my reason for the low score."
4,Userful and Reliable,"ERwin is a great product for modeling and generating databases and DDL scripts. However, this product hasn't been significantly upgraded in years, especially since Computer Associates bought it. It does all the basics but does not allow for much in the way of optimizing the SQL that it generates, particularly for views. Fantastic for Logical Modeling, Adequate for Physical Data Modeling. Don't count on platform specific extensions (Oracle, Teradata, etc.). Don't count on them being added anytime soon either."
4,Beautiful but not the color I ordered,"I ordered this dress in Sage and got a near Lime colored dress. Although I was under the impression I'd be getting a soft green dress the bright green suits me just as well. I'll post photos after it's altered a bit, which I knew would have to be done based on the measurements posted. That being said the dress is true to size compared to the sizing chart."
2,Not happy! Size runs small!!,"Dress is no where near the size chart indicated. Runs very small. Color was beautiful, just the sizing is way off. So don't go by the size chart."
1,1 star is 1 to much for this dress,"this is a horrible horrible dress. The proportions are off, the top of the dress is way too big, and I am big on top. This dress would NOT look good on anyone without major alterations. If this review stops 1 person from wasting their money on this dress it was worth my time!!!"
1,Quality SUCKS!!!,"The quality of this dress SUCKS!!! I ordered the dress to wear as a bridesmaids dress for my best friend's wedding. When I took the dress out of the packaging, the metal beaded thing on the front was falling off. I tried the dress on and had some trouble zipping it up, the zipper was bent. But I got it up and thought nothing of it. But when I put it on for the wedding, 30 minutes before the ceremony, we couldn't zip it up or unzip it. The zipper was stuck. So another bridesmaid had to sew me up, and after the wedding we still couldn't unzip it, so they cut the zipper so I could take the dress off. Amazon won't take any responsibility for the broken zipper, and now I'm out the cost of the dress plus shipping for a crappy dress that I'll never get to wear again. I'll be sure to never buy anything from Amazon again."
2,Cinched,"This dress is truly beautiful and the material is definitely of high quality...but the measurements suck. It was awkwardly long, going almost to my ankles when it's supposed to be around my knees....I'm an average 5'5"" so that seemed unusual. The hips were made big while the waist was tiny. The boobs were also quite large. I commend the women that are this shape, but it's not me! Buying this dress really put me in a bind since I had to return it. Beware of the measurments!!"
4,Gorgeous dress!,"I bought this dress in the brown. It is a beautiful copper/brown (not a boring brown). The fabric is shiney and sensual. The fit is true to size. I wear a 12 and bought the size recommended for 12-14. It fits beautifully. Due to the style, the bust is a little baggy, but a few tucks will help it. I'm 5'3"", and the dress is mid-calf, which adds to the elegance. It's a great dress for a wedding or fancy party. It also twirls nicely for dancing."
4,Great Dress :),"I'm a harpist and I bought the dress to play for my harp teacher's cocktail hour. The dress was a beautiful color and the perfect shape and length for the occasion; I got a good amount of compliments :). The only thing that bothered me was that it was a little difficult to iron since it was so delicate, and it says plus size but it fit like a normal dress which was fine since I'm only a regular small, but other than that it was great."
4,perfect dress,"this is the dress lm getting married in soon ,l love color, the style of dress and lenght as well and the feel of the satin ,its pefect for me as lm pear shaped"
3,Sadness,"I gave it three stars because it's a beautiful gown, and it shipped here in less than a week. But sadly it didn't fit right. It fit everywhere except for being very tight in the back. I decided to return it and get a different dress since it would be too big everywhere else if I got a bigger size."
4,Picture Perfect!,"I ordered this dress in the gold color for my husband's military ball. Let me just say, I felt like Marilyn Monroe. It is very sexy and elegant, but without being too revealing. The dress is tea-length (in-between the ankle and knee) so it is a perfect coctail, bridesmaid dress. I did not even have to wear a bra or any jewelry. My only problem was the rouging on the bust...you have to constantly fix it. A small concern, though."
3,Hmmm,"Why is TS so afraid of narrative?Most surfing movies f up story telling, so TS deals with the problem by not telling a story.Some nice images.But that is all it is."
2,blahblahblah,read it or use it to start a fire. it could have been written in half the space. not bad if youare really really into this self help stuff. you can do it man.!!
5,HOW TO BE CONVINCED ABOUT FASTING,"I'VE READ LOTS OF BOOKS RECOMMENDING FASTING BUT NEVER A WORD ABOUT THE REAL EFFECTS IN YOUR BODY, APART FROM LOSING SOME EXTRA POUNDS. THIS BOOK OFFERS A VERY DOCUMENTED REPORT."
5,Fasting and Eating for Health,I think this is excellent for someone who is serious about getting healthy and fit!
3,Good info but redundant,"I bought this book from my local books store b/c it was the only book on fasting available w/o having to be ordered. I read it all that night, deciding to skim through the rest of the book after about page 100 b/c of the authors tendency to repeat the same thing over and over again. The info is good but the book could of been half the length if edited better. I also didn't like how it told you how good fasting was but didn't give a lot of info on the actual act of fasting. I let a friend read it and she had the same complaint about the redundancy of the info, which gets annoying after awhile. My advice rent it from the library."
3,For the Non-Vegan as Well,"I bought this book knowing the author based his dietary recommendations on The China Study which has had holes punched in it so large a tractor-trailer could easily pass through (Google Denise Minger for more). I bought this book even though I don't eat the plant-based diet he recommends but instead eat a diet rich in virgin coconut oil, unrefined palm oil, grass-fed beef, pastured eggs and organic vegetables. And I DO recommend his book because of the data it contains regarding fasting. You see, water fasting plays a big part in my life."
4,Non-condescending Health Book,"Dr. Fuhrman practices what he preaches. He writes very candidly about the benefits that fasting entails, and the disaster food eating lifestyle that most Americans ""endure"". He doesn't though, really help identify with the anxiety, discipline and headaches that fasting personifies...rather he is very nonchalant.For anyone who wants to fast but doesn't have ""what it takes"", I would suggest supplementing this book with The Sugar Blues which illustrates how refined sugars not only damage the human body, but entire civilizations as well. I find that I can fast much more frequently and easially on a sugar free diet. Also another book, The Miracle of Fasting by Bragg, which is really the Bible on fasting, but his writing is somewhat flamboyant."
1,Fasting and eating for Health,The book is not helpful by itself. You must have the authors other books on fasting and eating. The book talks about the benefits and success stories only.
1,Okay we get it....,Mr. Furman spends too much time expounding on the benifits of fasting and too little time on technique. Very little information here.
2,Poorly Organized,"The main point of this book is well received: Prolonged fasting yields amazing health benefits.That being said, this book is extremely poorly organized. I think Dr. Fuhrman could've used a better editor, if in fact he had one at all. There was poor grammar, wandering topics, and the same points being repeated. I found it painful to read.As a side note, from a practical perspective I wouldn't recommend multi-day fasts as tool for losing weight. As Dr. Fuhrman notes, people often become extremely irritable. So, for someone who wishes to lose weight, an intermittent fasting regiment would work better if you still wish to remain functional at work. Use this book as a reference for getting rid of disease only."
5,Good Advice!,"Excellent advice, but I wouldn't do it without a health professional's supervision. Fasting can be dangerous for some with certain problems, like diabetes."
5,problem,"Hi, I'm an MD from Holland (age 25) and really liked the book. However, I tried complete fasting to remedy my recurrent depressions and tinnitus, but after 5 days I felt very weak and breathless. When I had my blood tested I had low red bloodcells (4.17 milj), low Hemoglobin (13 Gm/DL) low White blood cells (2.8 *1000)and High bilirubin total (2.5 MG/DL). Does any reader (doctor perhaps) know how to explain this? Was I breaking down cells in order to have enough energy supply? The doctor in Las Angeles that I visited couldn't explain it. He tested my liver enzymes but they were normal. So,I quit the fasting. Who can explain my problem?Greetings, Daan Timmer"
2,A feast for the faster,"This book is really for people who fast already. Very detailed discussions of the physiological affect of fasting. If you are looking for inspiration, this is not your book."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this book on accident with two other purchases, wanted a different title, but I read this because I have been sick and wanted to see what fasting could do. I was shocked with how long Dr. Fuhrman suggests fasting, although to his credit it is always recommended to be under a doctors supervision. If you are sick and at wits end, it may be worth looking at, but it is highly involved and must be with doctors supervision. I love Dr. Fuhrman's other nutrition books, however, and think he is fantastic overall."
2,Pseudo-Science,"The basic problem with this book is that, like much of what passes for health knowledge, it is based on anecdotal evidence. Thus, because a particular therapy seemed to help, or even genuinely helped, one person, does not make it a valid scientific method. There is no doubt that eating more vegtetables and fruits is good for you. Fasting may have some good benefits. But the book is woefully lacking in any valid scientific proof. For instance, there is a claim that fasting helps reduce build-ups in coronary arteries. If this is true, it would be fairly easy to run a scientific study doing before and after scans of those arteries using the lastest, non-invasive procedures that are available. Beware of following advise merely because someone has a MD degree!"
5,The ultimate book that covers every part of fasting & health,I have read every book I can find on fasting. This book is by far the best resource on fasting and proper eating than any other book I can find concerning this subject. This book has all their medical information backed up with references. I personally have followed their advice and have lost 26 pounds in 24 days and never felt better. Don't pass up this book unless you're not serious about fasting or losing weight.
4,a book that points out north american society is insane,I have to stop and think a lot about the information Dr. Fuhrman presents because what our modern medical system is doing makes no sense at all. The section on heart disease is very thorough and enlightening. Why are we so stupid as to not follow nature's way to heal ???????
2,Anecdotes galore!,"Crazy as it sounds... don't buy this book if you are already interested in trying a fast. This book is for the skeptics and naysayers, allow me to explain.So I buy the book, read read read several cases of anecdotal evidence regarding the benefits of fasting and all the while I am getting psyched to give it a try. I get to the end of the book only to read a disclaimer stating that your doctor should conduct the fast and that this book will not cover how to do it.I threw the book up in the air on a crowded train and yelled, ""Are you kidding me!?""Now listen, if my doctor knew anything about fasting I wouldn't have needed a book in the first case. It was my own stupid fault for not realizing that no doctor would risk the liability of publishing health advice or a how to that could be remotely harmful if screwed up but man... I was disappointed.In this book and my naivety."
1,"suggests microwave, unbelieavable","started reading the book, and on page 53, the writer suggests microwaving vegetables. it is very well known microwaving food is bad for health."
3,Dated,"This is the only bio of BT, so there are not many options besides this book if you want to learn more @ the dragoon. More than half the book is his career and love life AFTER the American Rev. Dated prose."
5,It Does Improve Your Tone,"I was skeptical of getting this cable at first, I thought that a cable was a cable and it didn't really matter to much what you use. I was wrong. Upon opening the package, you can feel the quality of this cable, it is thicker, stronger, and better looking than any other bass cable I have seen. When I plugged it in, I immediately noticed that my bass sounded better. It sounder fuller, and more bassy. The cable doesn't change your tone, it makes whatever tone you use sound better. Even my tone deaf dad said that the cable ""makes it sound a little better"", I say it makes it sound a lot better. While it is a bit on the expensive side, it is worth the money. The life time warranty is definitely a positive aspect.A final note, this is not the exact cable that I got. I needed the 21 foot cable. If you don't need that much cable, save some money and get the 12 footer. Get the combination of options that works for you. Whatever you choose though, this cable will not disappoint."
2,Spend a little more and get something else,"Broke my old Fender cable so I thought I'd give one of these a whirl.Pros:Definitely feels well-made; can probably take a beatingCons:Didn't sound any different (better or worse) than my cheap Fender - sounds fine, but didn't get any extra ""low-end punch"" it advertisesDoes not stay straight very well, which means if you like to move around you will get tangledIf this cable significantly removes crackling, it means you were using a REALLY cheap cable before. IMO, the increased price is due to better materials and durability, not superior sound. Worth it if you are looking for solid sound + durability. NOT worth it if you are looking for superior sound + durability."
2,"Sounds great, looks great, twists up badly","I was intrigued by the Monster idea of their wiring this cable as if it were balanced -- two conductors in the core instead of just one. Normally, I think Monster Cable is a lot of hype. I was impressed with this cable until I took it out on gig. I moved around a little during a few songs, looked down and saw the cable was all twisted up on itself, making it about six feet long. I unplugged it, twisted it back so it was straight, and played some more. Same result. I tried the same remedy again, and got the same result a few songs later. I'll continue to use this for practicing, but not for gigs."
2,Use with caution,Covers a fair amount of background for the neophyte in Hindu studies... but should be used with caution as there are several errors of fact and interpretation.
5,An Insightful Twist on the Golden Rule,"Very helpful. The Art of Connecting has several nuggets that you can take and apply immediately, built around what the authors call the ""Titanium Rule"" -- ""do unto others according to their druthers."" It's a powerful concept, yet a real challenge; how to know how others want to be treated, especially people from very different backgrounds?The focus of the book is how to ""tune in"" to these ""druthers""; the subtle clues that we often just let float by unrecognized and don't build upon. There are chapters on connecting one-on-one, taking other points of view, and working in diverse groups. Once the concepts are out of the way, the authors provide lots of examples and case studies to build on the learning.Bottom line...these concepts have helped me connect better through greater awareness of cues I had been missing. It's easy to put into practice and start to see benefits, if you're willing to invest a bit of effort. I don't think you can go wrong with this book."
4,Clear instructions for establishing rapport in a diverse business climate,"After studying people who have a great ability to connect with others, authors Claire Raines and Lara Ewing analyzed what you need to do to become a ""people person."" They present easy-to-follow guidelines. The most crucial tip is that you can find a point of similarity with anyone, no matter how different he or she seems from you, if you believe you can make a connection. First, learn to listen carefully and, then, once you uncover that similarity, you can build on it to communicate. Raines and Ewing fill their book with anecdotes from actual experience, and lots of ideas for fostering communication and overcoming differences. We recommend this manual to managers of diverse groups and others who want to learn to resolve conflicts."
3,Pretty Good....,"This book was adequate in the description and explanation of music theory, however it is not my favourite . . in several areas there are details that are not very clear - the instruction seems to start off very basic (which is exactly how it should begin) but then ramps almost too quickly into sketchy but complex explanation . . it is a slim volume and brief, but a bit too brief for some of the more difficult to grasp concepts. For just about the same money you can get (from Amazon) Learn to Read Music by Howard Shanet which is much more thorough, still starts with the very bare bones basics, but then is more consistent with the explanations as the concepts become more and more difficult."
5,"Very good, easy to use book.","I found this to be a very good book to learn the basics of how to read music. I sing in a choir and always had a hard time following the music in the sheet music books. The book helped a great deal, and I only wish that it contained a bit more instruction.. but I think that for less than ten bucks, it's a great deal."
3,"Pretty good, but some glaring omissions.","This is a pretty good book, but my biggest problem with it starts on page 54, ""The Structure of the Minor Scale"". In it, Helen Cooper writes, ""There are two forms of the minor scale...the harmonic minor and melodic minor."" The problem is there are really three. She neglects to mention the natural (or pure) minor scale, which is really the most common of all three. If you play the first eight white keys on a piano, starting with A, that's the natural minor scale. She also doesn't mention modes at all, which the major scale and natural minor scales came from. The major scale is Ionian mode, and the natural minor scale is Aeolian mode.The book I come back to over and over is ""Every Musician's Handbook"". Major scales, minor scales (all three of them), and modes are covered on pages 7 and 8."
4,learning to read music,"My son likes this book. He is interested in learning several instruments and this is the start to all of that. I was disappointed as it did not come with the DVD like I had purchased it for (and with Christmas craziness, I did not send it back). It is probably even better with the DVD."
3,Music,"This book helps so much. I bought a wookbook required for a class, but this book mentions everything the wookbook doesn't. It helps so much"
5,"A ""must have"" for learning music.","It is a good ""must have"" book for all music students. Easy to read and understand! - Artie"
3,"Useful as a reference guide, but that is about it...","I picked up this book after seeing it, by chance, on the shelf at a local bookstore. I was amused to see that someone was trying to throw all of the aspects of Wicca into one thin little ""pocket guide."" I was, however, a little surprised at what I found!Unlike some other books which contain too much mumbo-jumbo, this book seems to get straight to the point. The authors have some good layouts of circle casting and rituals...As I said, I would suggest this book as purely a reference guide - not for first time readers. Once a basic knowledge of Wicca is attained, this book has some good info!"
3,"If you're a real fan, you don't need this","I bought this book hoping it'd answer a few questions I'd never found the answers for(like what months does the series cover and how many years was it from start to finish).But sadly, none of those questions were answered. It often didn't reveal anything-- just asked more questions or repeated itself from a few pages before.If you follow the series through the anime or manga, you'd know everything they have in the book."
3,UNofficial guide,"I feel that this guide is more about the manga of YuYu Hakusho than the show. It spouts some lies. For example, Hiei's mother wasn't killed. She killed herself. Any of her kind that has a male child is shunned. For the disgraced their tribe. It was still a good unofficial guide. I wish it went more into the background of some characters like Yen."
3,"Very little ""new"" material. Don't bother.",The book is comprised of mostly Q / A and tries to pass off as new material. Almost every question could be answered by watching the anime or reading the manga once.Don't bother unless you want most of the series regurgitated at you with rare small tidbits information that you might not have known before.
3,Works,"Works fine, nothing special. I am not sure how long the lights will work as they are not LEDs. It would be better if the contacts clipped."
2,Falling short...,"I purchased this book hoping it would help me show a novice how to start modeling for games. While the author covers the overview and technical terms, the essential modeling instruction is severely lacking. The book talks about creating detail but fails to deliver quality examples.I bought this title because I own a few of the author's other works including the 3ds max bible. This was a dissapointment because it fails to provide the information on technical skills while it raises false hopes of earning money from games, if folks use this resource. (Read back of book cover)The up side to this book is in the overview. It does introduce the information and resources needed for the game industry, and it covers the basic concepts of animation and modeling, but does not mention many important pit falls common to many an aspiring beginner."
5,An Excellent Study,"This series of essays which was compiled by Lossky himself contains a great deal of insights into the topics treated - including Trinitarian theology, anthropology, Mariology and ecclesiology. As always Lossky shows an incredible knowledge of Patristic theology, while keeping apophatic theology and deification central to his thought. While the book doesn't quite back the inspirational power of his famous ""Mystical Theology"", the essays do connect well if you follow his nuance and for my money it is still one of the best theology books I have read. Blessings."
2,Disappointing,"This is the only time I can say I have not thoroughly enjoy a Lossky work. This is not a book but a collection of essays, articles, and papers which are compiled together into this volume. It's choppy and jumps. The theology is of course totally consistent, but the way he describes it, the more specific themes, etc. are explained in a way which leaves a lot of gaps. I don't recommend it."
1,A Legend in His Own Mind,"This is a TERRIBLE book, the most ill-conceived, self-contradictory tome on the subject it has ever been my misfortune to encounter. Lossky makes sweeping statements without a shred of evidence for them with a breath-taking non-chalance that virtually left me with the feeling that he felt he was speaking ""ex cathedra,"" a man who had begun to believe his own legend in his own time and his own mind because there were not enough actual scholars working in English at the time to challenge him. Of course, that's still true of most Eastern Orthodox ""authorities"" working in English to this day, and small surprise, since most of them are produced by the institution on which he and others of his generation (particularly Florovsky) left their mark so indelibly and where they left such a questionable legacy, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary."
3,Twin draft guards will work on some doors,"The three twin draft guards arrived today which was surprisingly fast. They will work on my doors because the doors aren't routinely used. One is an attic door and two are closet storage doors. I was also surprised by the fact that the guards are not 36"" as advertised. They come in two lengths of 18"" each. This difference in configuration, 2 pieces as opposed to 1 piece might not work well for some doors."
2,Waste of money!!!,"I received my twin draft guard in a timely manner, but when I did receive it by mail it was bent so this affected the product. I TOTALLY wasted my money. I used it for a couple of days but, my god it was such a hinderance to open and close the door. The twin draft guard was bent so the material could not adequately cover the draft under my door. It could not even stay attached to the door, so I had to use tape, which was ridiculous It is now back in my closet. It is a purchase that I deepely regret."
5,Review of Twin Draft Door Protector,"Saw this add on the TV and the door to my apartment has a significant gap where I can detect cooler aid entering. I was just fortunate to see the add on TV and immediately took down the required information in order to make the order. Thus far, totally satisfied. Am using masking tape to connect the interior section of the door protector to the door itself because it was not secure after opening and closing the door."
1,does not work,"This product does not work. My front door rolled over the foam padding causing the padding to get stuck under the door. I put it on my office door, which is an enclosed porch. It rolls a little smoother, but still does not block cold air."
1,twin door gaurd,Product not as it appears and not condusive to carpet areas. Waste of money to purchase this item
5,I love this product!,"I'm not quite sure why the other reviewers seem to have a problem with this product. I have two of them and have been using them for a few winters now. I love them. The foam is easy to cut and the nylon fabric is light enough to fold back over onto itself. It moves easily with the door when it's opened and closed (I have hardwood floors). The only slight problem I've encountered is that from time to time it will slip out lengthwise so that I can't close the door. But, it takes a millisecond to slide it back into place with my foot and I'm good to go for quite a while again. At $9.95 it's definitely worth giving it a try. I recommend this product."
3,Draft guard slips a bit when door is open,"Overall pretty happy, but the draft guard slips out of place and requires a bit more effort to keep it in place as designed. Especially problematic when it becomes wet on outside--concerned about it holding water...."
2,You get what you pay for,"A very simple solution. Unfortunately it doesn't fit all doors.The foam is too soft and as such ends up rolling under the door, creating a tripping hazard."
2,Didn't work as expected.,"My partner and I purchased this for our front door in order to eliminate the need for the ""door snake"" to stop drafts however it didn't work.We followed the directions to trim the Styrofoam inserts by measuring the door length however when trying to close the door it didn't work, the door wouldn't close properly. I am assuming that this is due to the rubber seal at the bottom of the door to eliminate water coming into the house.I can see how this would work in an interior door, however that doesn't make sense if you are trying to control drafts.Bottom line - be weary about purchasing this product if you are looking to stop drafts on your exterior doors, it didn't work for us."
1,Not a good product,A waste of money. Door must be very flush to floor in order for guard to stay put and the foam inserts don't do anything. Very flimsy.
2,Wouldn't buy again,Picture a tube of styrofoam. Now picture a sock over this tube of styrofoam. That's what you can expect. It gets bunched up alot but seems to be getting the job done for now. I don't expect it to last more than a few months. Next time I will look for something more durable.
1,Not goiing to stop any drafts LOL,This looks as shown but does not work as anticipated. Dont waste your money. A towell works better
4,Good Reference if Driving In Ecuador,Nice compact book of fold out road maps for driving in Ecuador. Used while driving in the Andes and around Quito. It was very helpful.
1,Minimal Range & $80 FCC License = Poor Value,"This GMRS 2-way radio claims to have ""UP TO 16 MILE RANGE"". However, on the back of the packaging there is a statement in very small print that reads, ""Maximum range can only be achieved over water or open rural areas under optimum conditions."" I live in a housing development in FL that has one small hill running through it. That small hill and the houses (all one story ranch) limits this radio's range to less than one mile! That's no better than a non-GMRS 2-way radio! The lack of range is reason enough to not recommend this radio. However, the real ""kicker"" is that in order to leagally operate these GMRS radios, you must pay a $80 fee to obtain an FCC license! Bottom line: Save your money. This radio's ""long-range"" capability is ""incapable"" unless you live in the ""flatlands"" or on a boat."
5,Very Informative and Interesting!,This a great book for homeopaths and homeopathic students to learn about the sequential method of prescribing. I highly recommend it!
3,Good on the surface,"The book goes into a fair amount of detail on certain topics, like server log files, and the generalized architecture of modern web sites. However, it doesn't really drill into any detail on the issues that may come up, such as cookieless browsers, ideas for cleansing dirty URLs, and methodology issues (when do you not count a pageview?).As for the construction of the warehouse itself, it does provide some good generalized schemas that you can use for ideas, but nothing that you couldn't dream up yourself with a few days on a project.A good overview, but no substitute for on-the-job learning."
3,Good book for beginners and intermediate,The book is a good intro to web data warehousing. I am not disappointed with my purchase but I think my purchase of Kimball's data webhouse book was a better buy (used). Question: Is there a new edition of this book?
3,Need to spend more to reduce ghosts & flare,"I got this filter a couple of years ago to use on my Canon EF-S 18-200 lens. I was hoping it would be a good compromise between price and quality. The filter usually works OK, but I do occasionally see ghosts or flare on my images. I finally gave up and ordered a B+W XS-Pro. It cost more that twice as much as the Tiffen, but I can really see the difference.As a test, I put both the Tiffen and B+W filters side-by-side on a table top in a room with ceiling lights. I then positioned my head so I could see a ceiling light reflected by each filter surface. With the Tiffen filter, a bright reflection appeared. With the B+W, the reflection was barely visible.If you are want to get the best possible quality images from your camera lens, then I suggest you pass on this filter and spend more money for a better one."
4,"Good quality, so-so fit","It's a very nice pair of shoes, takes a good shine, looks good and is not falling apart after a few uses. Unfortunately, even though I have a relatively high instep, the shoe is built so high that it slides fore and aft on my foot, and the heel bounces up and down as though this were a pair of flip-flops and not a closed shoe. I'll have to come up with something to cover the top of my foot to provide a bit of height to hold the shoe on tighter."
4,Good shoes!,These shoes are made with excellent construction and materials. I also think they fit just fine.
1,Agreed. Too small.,I ordered these on sale. Great deal - wish they were true to size. A 10 is normally a bit large on me and they were significantly small (mainly narrow). Shoes were light and nice looking. I knew right away after trying them on.
1,NEGATIVE STARS - BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS GUY,"Do some research on this man. (Really, I would hope no one would be viewing this page anyway... but just in case...) you can check this at three ""w's"" dot edresearch dot c followed by o followed by m. Look under ""Hall of Shame."""
4,Beautifully Written Little Book,Giamatti writes with love and intelligence about the very poetic game of baseball. A must read for any real baseball fan.
3,Ok...,The language of Giamatti is wonderful and there are some interesting stories in here. It is nothing more then that and it really wasn't my cup of tea. I would have liked to see some more intertwined stories about his life in baseball. I guess this was as good as it was going to get.
2,A work whose excellence shames the character of the author.,"For all of his literary and academic accomplishment, A. Bartlett Giamatti did not outlive the incontestable fact the the one thing, the only thing, he did with his office as Commissioner of Baseball was to singlemindedly drive Pete Rose from Major League Baseball. For all the broken hearts and green fields, he should have included the dark, greasy underside of shabby power politics and the smug, heartless, endless free ride that went with his tenure."
2,Shoulda sampled more before purchase,"So when Jerry picks bluegrass, that's one thing. When some other folks ""cover"" him and do pure bluegrass renditions of his (and GD) stuff, it's not quite the same.This album was a bit too instrumental with electronic accompaniment. A bit too much like sitting in the doctor's office somewhere in the Ozarks."
3,It lives in the cloud?,"Well, I thought I would try this video library service since it was the one reasonable way that I could view an episode before the new season started. The video was viewable on my laptop and was excellent quality. The issue that I had with this service is that unlike DVDs. I have to be hooked up to stream the media. I can't just download it and burn it to DVD, at least not eazily. The result is that I cannot share this video with my Mother who is now hooked on season one. I don't mind the video library, but I must have a way to view this offline. Oh yeah. My TV in the living room is internet connected through an X-box; however, the only way to view the video is to subscribe to Microsoft through some Gold membership. Quite expensive for a video wouldn't you think. I will now search for the DVD so that I can watch it anywhere I like!"
5,Suits season 2,After seeing season 1 expectations were high in our household for season 2 and it does not disappoint. Well written and smart with plenty of twists and turns. To many lawyer series are predictable this one isn't. With amazon prime we can watch it on our schedule. What could be better. Can't wait for season 3.
3,great show,"Good show about lawyers. The only downside is that its pretty predictable. But, overall good. Louis cracks me up. fun, fun!"
1,Borng,This was one of the most boring episodes. I've watched the show from the beginning. You may want to skip this one.
1,Very impressed,I couldn't find Season 2 anywhere. I was very impressed with the procedure and quality of the videos. Great set-up!
5,Great show,"Very addicting. Well written. Great characters. Funny. Show builds from pilot episode, I recommend watching it from first episode of first season and in order for maximum enjoyment."
2,"fragmented, disappointing and thrown together","Suits is by far one of the most intriguing glimpses inside the environs of law without dumbing the audience down. Not so with season two's finale, ""War"". It was presented as a quickly thrown together mishmash of story lines straight off the chopping block. It was confusing to say the least. The characters seemed disoriented and distracted with where they belonged in the story as well. Suits is crisp, smart, a no-holds-barred saga that has been watched from its beginning. This is the first of which a commentary was felt greatly needed. It will continue to be viewed faithfully, yet with the hope everyone wises up and gets some apparent greatly needed off season rest.Best of luck to all involved."
5,Good balance of comedy and drama!,The characters on Suits are absolutely fantastic! The chemistry between Harvey and Mike has definitely matured but the writers put enough humor into the script that it doesn't hinder their relationship.
5,"Suits, Season 1, Discovery","OMG! This is the best show on TV right now! Please make this show's season longer, thereby giving us more episodes to watch! Gabriel Macht makes his character so interesting and fun to watch. He is really a hot guy. Move over Matthew McCoughney, Gabriel Macht is in town! Patrick is cute too. This show is so cute when all the characters banter back and for - the writing is excellent. Love Donna. Bring her back. Love all the actors in this show.Josey Newman, Atlanta, GA"
5,Addicting!!!,Can't wait for each new episode....fabulous! The characters are well developed and endearing. Season 2 is just as good as Season 1 and hasn't fizzled out....
5,Stellar Job Once Again,"The cast and crew of Suits have overtaken themselves this season. In this season plot twists are twister, comebacks are wittier, and feelings are stronger. In all a stellar performance that stretches far and beyond last seasons. I highly recommend this series to everyone because I feel that this series has something for everyone. See you there..."
5,Fun Stuff!,It is fun to watch. It is easy to get hooked on their world. Gabriel and Patrick are hot! Not crazy about Jessica - this role needs to be recasted.
4,Season 1 of Suits,"They are all fantastic to watch. I download them to my Kindle Fire and watch them at work, during break time and lunch. I'm addicted :) Just kidding they are really good."
5,nicely done!,Simple and sweet. Love the recap and especially want Donna back. She is a big part besides Harvey needs his sidekick.
5,In a class by itself,One of the best shows on cable television. Definitely in the top 5. The second season has been the best.
5,I like it ...,"I think i would prefer to see more of Mike Ross' mind at work ... but right now the story line within the ""office"" is working ... the personal lives of Ross isn't really necessary .... It would be nice to see the personal life of jessica and donna .. ??and yes, Rachel and Mike should get together ..."
5,my opinion,"the funny thing about my ""crush"" on Gabriel Macht is that I didn't have it until the last eposide of Suits season 2 when Harvey & Mike were stoned in Mikes apt and he smiled....the lines around his eyes and he was fun......I am addicted !!"
4,Kindle Watch,I was able to watch the series on my Kindle Fire during my flight. Great video. Great story line. Believable?
5,More of Harvey,Harvey is back at it again showing that he has layers to his personality. To see Harvey outside of his slick polished demeanor was great!
4,Suits Season 2,"Interesting, somewhat dramatic and occasionally witty. Season two has a great plot line as Harvey fights a lawsuit that could end his career if he doesn't win. There are some twists with Donna at the firm. Mike struggles with a blowing loss not related to any cases. All in all a good season."
4,Interesting and Fun Program,We are still getting segments added to Season 2 and enjoy each. We really prefer buying a programming season rather than spending money for a TV channel that gives you lots of uninteresting and stupid programs.
5,Suits hits it out of the park again,The action and plot twists keep me coming back every week. My favorite series this year! Team Harvey and Mike.
2,All hype,"Okay, maybe I got a lemon out of the bunch, but I would never recommend this printer to anyone. Constant paper jams (even with extensive cleaning and maintenance), paper errors, and I can run a mile in less time than it takes this thing to warm up.Print quality is very good (after it's warmed up for 5 minutes), but with all the other headaches I've had with this printer, it's not worth it. I spend more time fixing this printer or having a warranty call on it than it spends printing.Go with Canon or Xerox. Stay away from this overpriced printer."
2,There's a Reason This Thing is Discontinued by HP...,"Let me start out by saying that I'm an HP-certified printer tech, and I generally really like HP's printers. The HP LJ 8550n has excellent print quality, reasonable print speeds, and a high capacity for upgrade. Unfortunately, it's also a constant problem. Even lovingly maintained, this printer is a royal pain in the pocketbook. In the course of 6mo, I've had to replace 1 formatter ($1500), 1 duplexer ($200), 3 transfer kits ($300), and countless other parts that shouldn't be replaced that often. Take the advice of an HP guy and avoid this money pit. HP has many other printers which are far superior to this monster."
3,Nice. Just Nice . . .,"A pleasant, if forgettable little soundtrack. Just like the movie. Light, fluffy. As intended.Doris Day is at her best here.And the best thing here is the joy (really!) in hearing the personable Durante (as ""Pop Warner"") singing (and that IS his singing voice!) on a few tracks. You'll smile in spite of yourself.A great 35 minutes of happiness and contentment from an age long ago . . ."
4,Orquesta de la Luz,I enjoyed the the classical Christmas songs with that salsa beat. a very enjoyable CD.
5,Feliz Navidad-from Japan,The Japanese salseros have done it. A Christmas Album with the funkiest salsa sound around. A must own for collectors.
5,GREAT headphones,"Ordered them in white, to match my iphone.The bass in these are AMAZING. i spend hundred's of dollars on previous headphones, including shure's and bose, and for price, and comfort, these are the best headphones I have ever purchasedPros: Great Value, comfort, sound, and some noise cancellation. Awesome and sleek design and fit.Cons: They DO NOT work with the iPhone. The jack is to thick, and the iPhone has a deep jack socket so they are not compatible. Therefore, to use with an iPhone, you need the Belk Adapter, which sticks out like a radio antenna because its so long.Otherwise. AWESOME deal and Product. Highly Recommended."
3,"Love these headphones, but only sometimes.","If you enjoy bass-heavy music, these buds are awesome.I myself enjoy all sorts of genres, given a ton of bass-heavy things, but when it comes to the more ligher, poppy songs with less of an emphasis on bass and basslines, these headphones could possibly ruin some of them. Unless you like your music with a ton of bass, then go for it! take it as a pro!Overall though these headphones are NOT very durable, sadly. Would give a higher rating if they were more durable, but hey, what earbuds ARE durable anyways?3.5 stars, if that were possible."
1,"Started out great, but completely died after a few months of use!","I usually don't write reviews, but I was so upset when these headphones suddenly stopped working. The product (when still functioning) was to my liking, as they canceled out noise and had a decent bass boost. However after about 6-7 months of using them (not even frequently, I might add) the wire right at the base of the headphones needed to be toyed with in order to not get static, or just the right headphone. It was annoying and once that was done, it stopped working completely and now there's no sound at all.I wouldn't spend your money on these. As much as I liked them, they malfunctioned way too fast."
2,So so head phone,Bought this after reading good review. I am not impressed with the poor quality and cheap looking head phone. Would not recommend this.
2,Sound good but do not last,The v-moda earbuds sound above average but do not last; one earbud died within 6 weeks of purchase and the customer serviceis sub-par (+ they require me to pay shipping for their faulty product)
3,"Generally good, overly loose bass","The Vmoda earbuds make for decent in-ear phones at a reasonable price, but compared to similarly priced headphones, the bass is loose and overpowers much of the mids and highs. Otherwise, they're attractive, seem to be reasonably well build and the cables don't have excessive microphonics like some other sets. Mostly the audio quality is sub-par, even in this range of headphones."
2,Don't Bother,"Nope. Had three pair, and all three fizzed out after a short while. Terrific while they are new, but they have no longevity. I'm sure it's just poor quality control and cheap components. These things should last longer than a month. Sorry."
3,"They were nice, but they broke after 6 weeks","I bought these after my old headphone broke, I use 'em at least 3 hours a day walking to and from class and everywhere in between. They are stylish and discreet, they have 3 different bud sizes to put in your ear, but I wasn't too comfortable with any of them. Good Bass, decent noise canceling for earbuds thanks to the earplug seal. After 6~7 weeks of use the left earbud stopped working, or it only works when the cable is bent a certain way, it's quite annoying. The color pairs seem to bee cheaper, I don't know if that has anything to do with quality (I bought the red ones). Satisfactory for the price, but I wish they were more durable, might buy again to see."
2,Fail to Work Properly after 2 months,"I bought these in December 2011, and now only sound comes out of one side of the earphones. It sometimes doesn't have any sound. The sound quality is superb for the price, but it doesn't really matter if the headphones start to fail after 3 months."
1,"Okay earphones, but died within 3 months","Usually I use headphones for walking around or running and my last pair of headphones lasted me over a year with no problems. This pair failed within 3 months. The left earphone still works fine, but the right earphone has such little sound coming out of it that it is hard to tell it is even playing. This makes the headphones almost useless and really unpleasant to use. I've never had headphones fail so quickly and am really disappointed. My last pair of earphones was made by V-moda, and I loved them, so I bought these with high expectations. Don't buy these headphones if you expect them to last more than 3 months."
3,Great earbuds when they work,Great sounding earbuds with excellent bass. Only problem is the build quality. Even with excellent care won't last over a year. Still a good deal as long as you know what you're getting.
4,Awesome little headphones for the price,"Not much to say here that hasn't already been said...outstanding quality sound for the cost (I got these for under ten bucks). They feel like quality buds, but also maybe a bit delicate as well. I can't speak to the durability, but at this price, it is more than worth it. If I am going to do something that breaks these buds, then it would also probably break a more expensive pair as well. For the price, they can't be beat."
2,Durability is an issue,"Now I really love the sound quality and the sleek look of this headphone, but durability is an issue. I purchased less than two months and it already stop functioning properly. It’s actually bizarre. I hear the music in term of the sound, but not the singing/words of the artists. I thought it was my Ipod and Iphone, but unfortunately it was the headphone."
3,Only lasted 3 to 4 months.,I had just put out a good review on these earphones since i had them for about three to four months. I kidd you not the next day i started using them the music started sounding choppy and I had to hold the wire a certain way to get it to work. I plugged them into my computer to make sure it wasn't my phone and sure enough it was the earphones.I gave them a 3 because prior to them not fuctioning..I loved how they worked.
4,Good Quality for the price,"I bought these for my iPod, and since their earbuds are really comfortable and don't hurt your ears after a while worn. Don't expect these to be the best sound in the world as compared to products that cost $200, but don't think these are crappy either. These have really good bass, are comfortable, and at a good price. Have had them for months now and still working great."
5,Great sounding headphones!,"These headphones are well worth the price! You can get some colors for cheaper, if you're not dead set on the black or white. The bass is punchy and the mids and highs are well represented. Listening to music through these earbuds just make music listening sooo much better! However... there's one downside. Where the wire goes into the earbuds and to the 1/8"" connection... it's not very secure. I've had to buy several of these pairs because of how easily the connections get ruined. However, this time I got smart and put some duct tape around those connections to help secure them. If you don't mind putting a little bit of duct tape on your ear buds... I definitely suggest them!"
4,"+tasty sound, +comfy,+rubber cones stay on, - stiffish wires","I enjoy these buds on my itouch and Sansa Clip, both. They sound deep and even to me, but I can't claim to have golden ears. The V-modas just make me smile.Somehow, they don't squeeze me ear canals like other buds I've owned. So no headache.Wouldn't it be sweet if the wires were as flexible as, say, Apple original equipment. Just an aesthetic thing.The rubber cones - yeah, they stay on there. No hunting."
4,Amazing sound but not durable,"I have purchase two sets of these earbuds.. They have amazing sound and superb bass. I also have a pair of Quietcomfort 2 Headphones, but many times I would use these because their sound is good enough and they are lighter to wear.However it appears that after a year the chord shorts out.. I wish they would make the chords more durable, but otherwise its a great product.."
3,V-Moda Bass Freqs,"I really like Bass Freqs, but it didn't last very long for me, the wires broke... I guess they're pretty thin."
3,Earbuds,They work fine but I don't think the sound is that much different than earbuds that are in the $10 range
5,Wow! Light and Powerful!,"I never knew that mini buds could sound this good. Yes, it is another $35.00 you put out but believe me...these are excellent. They are very light and fit comfortably in your ear. They do not bounce around like standard buds do and they give you a sound that hits hard. It gives crisp highs and pounding lows like you would expect from high end headphones. The set comes with three pair of ear inserts and after listening to the smallest ones, I was less than moved. When I replaced them with the mediums, my whole outlook was changed, you have to experiment! The plus about these is that they actually are noise isolating and the outside world is not even there when you listen to your music. I don't recommend wearing them while jogging or driving or anything that requires your attention due to this feature. Lastly they look good, come in different colors, and hey...you've done worse with $35.00. Get these today and hear the difference they make."
4,Great Buy,"Great sound, much better comfort than most. Wires seem a little fragile.Best buy for the price."
2,"Good sound, bad quality","Compared to the stock earphones they are great. The bass is much more noticeable, and the same mp3 will come out richer and more enjoyable to hear. However, these broke down on me in a week. And I just used it like any regular person would."
3,"Great sound, but not very sturdy","These headphones provided amazing sound for how small they were, but they lasted me for about two and a half weeks.Within that time, the thin plastic casing around the earbuds cracked and tore open, ruining the sound for both of them. The sound still played, but was very quiet and not worth the use.I suggest purchasing these, but take very good care of them and don't just throw them into your backpack or anywhere where they can be damaged, because they will not hold up."
4,Five stars for the price!,"I purchased these to use under my hearing protection while during yardwork. The sound is quite good, the bass strong but not overpowering, and I can play my ipod at a level that will not leave me deaf. Would buy them again."
4,Fit is Everything,"I was about to press send on a review lambasting this product as being so different from expectations set by the c|net review, but other reviewers mentioned the ""bud sizing"" needing to be right. Out of the box, they appear to have the smallest silicon insert. The fit felt fine, so it didn't occur to me to change it. However the sound quality was awful, especially the bass.When I changed to the middle size the sound quality difference was remarkable. The silicon is soft, so the larger sizing is not uncomfortable and the sound is great.I'm not sure why V-MODA ships with the smallest silicon insert as the default, but they do a huge disservice to themselves for the ""out of box"" experience. I'm an average sized adult and with the larger insert, they are a great pair of comfortable earbuds.FYI, others have commented about getting the buds out of the packaging. I found cutting completely around the crimped edging of the clamshell was the easiest way to get them out."
3,Revised Review,"Overall I am happy with the V-Modas. They fit my smaller ears, are comfortable, stay put and do a great job reducing noise and out of courtesy to others, nobody can hear my music either. I did have to adjust the EQ setting on my iPod; the bass is that strong (my music of choice, electronica). The only thing I would be concerned about would be losing the silicon fittings in which case I would be SOL... otherwise, I highly recommend these.Revision to review: 5 stars to 3 - after approximately 6 months of use, sound in one ear bud began cutting out. I figured it was the cable to the left bud and taped it tightly. This lasted pretty well for a while until it went out completely. Granted, I used mine everyday even though I took great care with it. They all go at some point... I would still buy them again."
4,Great price for great sounding earbud headphones,This is my second pair of vmoda bass headphones and I've tried others and these are by far the best for the money. I hghly recommend them.
4,Lives up to the name!,"Bought these because the stock iPod earbuds don't fit me. Sound quality is excellent, with very full, well-defined bass (as you would expect from the product name). It's astonishing how big a sound can come from such tiny devices. Fairly good noise isolation too. The 3 different sizes of tips are OK, but I still find the buds slipping out occasionally, and getting them situated just right in my ears for the best sound seems to take more fiddling than I think it should, but I'm picky."
