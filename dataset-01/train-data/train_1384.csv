1,Just not worth it.,"I purchased this very cheap item with the intent for it to be a practice strop to work on my technique. I knew the quality would be poor, but I was surprised how completely unusable this product was even for just practicing. The strop arrived in expert amazon packaging but with a huge deep bend in the center of the leather (see picture attached to item). The bend caused deep bumps and ridges in the leather which makes this just unusable. The fabric side doesn't have this problem, but it is of very low quality. Even if the product arrived with out the crease, the quality of the strop is very poor. I could only recommend this as a decorative prop."
1,Horrible quality; suggest not buying for any purpose.,"Ordered two of them to cover in paste and use for sharpening. Leather looked so rough out of the package on both of them that I never used them for anything. One came scarred up with knicks in it, the other had a 2 inch square section that was all messed up as if it were a knot in a piece of wood. The leather had deep cracks in it.I wasn't expecting much when buying from prior reviews, but I got even less than that."
1,WRONG,"I got this for a straight razor, and as others have noted, the canvas is too course and the leather is of poor grain and quality. But this tool is also heavy, akward and entirly too wide for a straight razor. This might be the right strop if you wanted to do a poor job sharpening an axe"
5,Sturges at his best!,"Preston Sturges is one of the best directors -- ever -- and this is one of his very best. Unlike some of his later films, Sturges keeps the film moving quickly. He packs it with thoughtful lessons about love, friendship and success. The film is warm and sincere but also sharply observes human failings and the humor they generate.Sturges' later brilliant comedies often cause this one to be overlooked. It is fully their equal, and deserves a much broader audience."
4,"What would you do with $25,000?","Christmas in July is the story of a man (Dick Powell) who struggles to make ends meet every day. He enters a slogan contest for a coffee company hoping to win the $25,000 prize. Some co-workers hear of his dreams and decide to play a joke on him; they forge a telegram congratulating him on winning first place. He goes into a frenzy buying things left and right being truly happy for what seems like the first time in his life. Eventually the bubble bursts, but even the ending of the film is fun rather than sad.Dick Powell is wonderful here. It is great to see him outside of his light musical role; here he is much more realistic, less innocent and happy. It is interesting that the screen illustrates how poor the characters are and how dull their lives are; it is unglamorous and more realistic than one might expect."
4,great fun for all,"What if...you entered a contest and then believed you won a large sum of money, when it turned out you didn't win?that's the basis of this fast-paced film when Dick Powell gets a telegram that was bogus, claiming he won.He is able to collect the prize and buys for everyone like being a ""Santa"" in July giving out gifts. Then it's discovered no winner was picked.The story moves fast and like many films has a happy ending. But you will enjoy it from start to end. Written and Direced by Preston Sturges, who had many hits within a short time. Other hits are The Lady Eve and Unfaithfully Yours. This is perhaps the shortest film he mad, lasting just over an hour. If you like comedy, this is for you,"
2,Not a masterpiece,"This film combines a rather dull, predictable and contrived plot with inconsistent characters. William Demerest plays a minor role in the movie, but ""Uncle Charlie"" is by far its highlight. A couple of slapstick scenes including a fishfight (yes, a fishfight) prevent the movie from having no redeeming aspects. Potential purchasers, beware! This is not a Christmas movie. Set in July, it takes its title from one line in the movie. Not worth the price of admission or even rental."
2,Dull and unlikeable,"I am a big fan of classic films and watch very little recent fare. I was looking forward to this film based on critical reviews of Preston Sturges' ""genious"". In 67 minutes I chuckled once or twice. It is dull. The hero and heroine are dolts. Are all Preston Sturges films this bad?"
4,Towing Mirrors,Got these towing mirrors for my hubby before we went on a trip with the camper and they worked very well. Amazon had the best price & they shipped very fast. They were easy to install/remove and did what they were suppose to. I talked to other people and was told to get these because they just slide right over your existing mirror rather than the kind that you have to strap on. Have only used them twice but so far so good.
5,cipa mirror,"these are easy on and off, i didn't want mirrors hanging on the truck when not in use. i just drove about a 1000mile round trip pulling my camper these worked great, very little vibration, and the view was adequate from the mirror."
4,Cheaper than installing OEM trailer mirrors,"You can't go wrong for the money, and they look pretty good when installed. The fit seems to be a little sloppy, but I don't think there is any danger of them coming off. Much better than the universal ones with the rubber straps. OEM trailer mirrors are over $300.00. For 10% of that, you get these. Unless you really need power mirrors, this is the way to go."
3,dont fit quite right,bought these for my 1991 suburban. they dont slide all the way on like i think they are supposed to. i will have to do some trimming on the bottom of the plastic to get them to slide all the way on. otherwise they seem like a good add on for towing.
3,Attention to Detail,"I received these mirrors within three days of placing the order. They appear to be of good quality material, however, neoprene strips were not included, the directions were too generic, and no invoice was included."
4,Rear view mirror extensions,We saw these mirrors in use on a friends truck and were impressed by the added visability they provided. Installation was straight forward and easy to accomplish. We are satisfied with the purchase.
1,Not very helpful,the format is too confusing. very few questions with mini lectures as explanations. It is very difficult to find the exact question to help with the hard to grasp areas.
5,Very cool book,"From the Playboy magazine, this is a wonderful archive of some of the greatest tricks and tools a man could ever know. Designed to be a 30 second teach, with step by step picture instructions, this book makes a great gift and something worth having around. Going to buy another for my dad right now actually... A+"
4,AMUSING AND INSTRUCTIONAL,"This is a nice little collection of the over 50 of Playboy's Mantrack blueprints. The categories are broken-down into Dressing & Grooming, Giving & Receiving, Drinking & Smoking, Eating & Entertaining, Sports & Survival, and Cards & Dice. While I find the bra strap clasp an amusing addition (and sneer that they advocate 4/5 fingers needed to unhook said clasp instead of 3), anyone needing this blueprint (or clasp to practice on) is a sad individual who is in need of more help then is offered here."
4,decent,"I have owned plenty of work gloves and since I collect dewalt tools, I figured these would just add to the obsession. They are comfortable to wear and seem to be rugged. They are synthetic leather although you wouldn't know it when you put them on. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because they take a while to dry. I sweat a lot and these seem to soak up the sweat more than traditional leather gloves and take a while to dry (days). Other than that, I would highly recommend these gloves."
1,I GOT MISTAKEN,"OH NO WHEN I BOUHT THIS CD IN THE LATIN MUSIC STORE I THOUHT THEY WHERE LOS DIABLOS A CHICANO GROUP FROM CALIFORNIA,LOS DIABLOS WAS THE MUSIC THAT MY JEFITO USED TO LISTEN WE I WAS A CHABALITO SO NOW I WANTED TO BUY A CD OF DIABLOS BUT I GOT THE WRONG ONE MAN THIS DIABLOS ARE NOTHIN BUT...THERE NOT THE REAL FIRME DIABLOS BUT FOR YOU PEOPLE LOOKING FOR LOS DIABLOS THE CHICANO GROUP IS ACTUALLY CALLED LOS DIABLOS INCOMPRABLES OK AND BE TRUSHA BECAUSE...DOLLARS SOMETIMES ARE HARD TO LOOSE IT ON... LIKE I DID."
3,Half right..,"Caution. This item is listed as a valve cover set, but is really only for one valve cover. You would need two to change both valve cover gaskets on the V6 engine it fits. Somewhat disappointing."
5,Great book dealing with life issues in a realistic way,"Awesome story of life, and how anyone can come to know Christ, but we still have struggles. Life is full of its ups and downs, and this book has them all. From an incredible love, to murder, to drugs and full of poor choices; this book will keep you glued to your seat to get to the next page. This book is for anyone, while there is a bit of mature theme, there is no sex in the book, but it does deal with drug addiction."
2,Not my favorite,"I had a difficult time getting into this book. I wasn't totally sold on the concept of the rock star turned Christian singer. For me, there was a disconnect between his story and the guy who got high on meth."
3,Gritty Faithwalk,"Creston Mapes' second novel, Full Tilt, rocks with suspense especially throughout the last page-turning half.The whole world as Everett Lester knew it has changed. His days are spent learning to live as a new Christian, and attempting to help his family find God. He sheds the comfortable darkness of his past and the light reveals the damage he did to those he loves.Mapes did his homework on the insidious and dangerous addictive power of methamphetamine. Under Meth's influence, Lester's nephew veers out of control toward self destruction, and Everett is compelled to save Wesley.This book is overtly Christian, with prayers and Bible verses quoted.If you are a fan of Dark Star, you should love this book. If you have issues of faith that sometimes border on doubt or self-hatred, this novel may encourage you. If you or someone you love struggles with addictions, this novel may hold some insight."
5,Still Rocking...,"In this sequel to Dark Star, Creston takes us on a thrill ride. Everett is still rocking but the born again believer is now doing it for the Lord and not everyone is happy that the wildly popular group, Death Stroke has disbanded.Everett wants to begin a new life with wife, Karen, but they are plunged into danger again and again, first by their Meth addicted nephew, then by Everett's gambling addicted brother who is in deep with the mob.Murder, drugs, rock n roll and redemption. This book has it all. It also includes a fair amount of prayer, ministering, and scripture quoting as well.You do not have to have read book one to fully understand and enjoy Full Tilt.Creston's writing is even better in this novel. He doesn't shy away from tough issues and once again proves that no one is beyond redemption. I recommend Full Tilt to anyone who has suffered from addiction or knows someone who has and to those who have sowed some wild seeds before coming to Christ."
3,Not what I expected,"The storyline was good, the characters were decently fleshed out but the religious references were sometimes so unnecessary that they actually were a distraction from the story itself."
2,very complicated,"This is the most confusing electronic purchase I have ever made. My son is a computer wizard and agreed with me. The manual is worthless and we spent hours trying to figure it out, and ended up returning it to Amazon. It also seemed as if the picture was stretched to fill the screen, causing the faces to be distorted. I would not buy this again."
1,Not worth your money.,"I agree with the second review. I just got this frame yesterday and I am returning it back to Amazon. This product does not deliver! It is sold as 7"" display frame (the box says so as well) yet when I measured the screen it is only 6""?!?!?! Page 4 of the booklet states that box containes 2 additional frames (SIlver & CHerry) I looked and looked and I could find those."
2,Bigger isn't better,I was just looking for the biggest frame for the price and didn't think about digital quality. When we turned it on there were lines through many of the pictures and they didn't look crisp like digital photos more like copies on photos. Also you cannot change the slide show effects or speed.
5,Just Dandy!,"This is my Fourth GPX Digital Frame! They work great. Wish they'd show Windows movie's, though. The thumb-jump-flash USB interface is useful."
2,Not satisfied,"There was a thin white line running down the left side of the screen, about 1/4"" in from the side.All of my pictures were oriented vertically, but the frame showed some horizontally. I could figure out how to get them to rotate, but the next time that photo came up it had to be rotated ""manually"" again."
5,AWESOME Digital Photo Key Chain!!,"GREAT little digital photo key chain for the price! I prefer to accessorize my purse with it! It will hold up to 180 PHOTOS, that is a lot of pictures compared to the other digital key chains I have seen out there. I LOVE it too because it keeps my younger children entertained standing in line at the grocery store, post office, doctor's office, etc.. I keep photos of my children, their grandparents, cousins, friends, & more. At this price it also makes an AWESOME gift. I have given as a gift to friends and family, with a few pictures already downloaded for them to enjoy and then they can add their own. My 10 year old daughter has also given one as a gift to a good friend with some FUN pictures of them hanging out. I would definitely buy another one again!"
1,Never worked!,"I purchased this as a gift. The first one I ordered wouldn't do ANYTHING!The second one I received as a replacement wouldn't do ANYTHING! Gave up on this item, Amazon was GREAT though, fast and efficent customer service."
2,Poor quality display,"Once again I learned a great lesson - you get EXACTLY what you pay for.This deal sounded like a great bargain - you get 9"" frame for $79. But when I got this frame and turned it on, I understood why it was so inexpensive. Display quality is very poor, I could not get it to work right out of the box - usb connector was loose, display would not turn on - it would light up and nothing would show.To make a long story short - I sent it back. I have give credit to Amazon. Fantastic customer service, got return labels in minutes, refund was issued within days.Then I bought a frame made by Philips. What a difference in picture quality."
1,Software doesn't work - so cannot get photos loaded!,"The software bombs even though I'm using Windows XP with nothing crazy. It just errors out and says ""No Photo Viewer is found, program termined!"" (even the last word is misspelled in the error message). Looks like a good product, but I can't get my pictures over to it, so it's junk. Good luck."
4,Tekken,"What can be said here, Tekken.It is nice to see a major fighting series hit the PSP. I enjoy DOA and most of the other series but this one is good. It hits the spot when on the go or going from place to place. The same characters, the new customizable features. The 'movie theatre'."
5,JUEGO,"Excelente producto, muy buen juego, volvere a comprar nuevamente juegos de PSP gracias por todas las atenciones y los requerimientos"
5,Best PSP game series ever,"Tekken is the best series from PSP, mainly because all you do is fight, and none of that strategy nonsense."
5,One of the best!! A+++++,"A fantastic game, great gameplay with top of the line graphics! There is plenty of extra features and anyone not familiar with the series can learn all the right moves to win. My only complaint is the omission of a couple of my old favorites, namely Ogre, Dr. Boskonovich, and yes even Gon!"
4,Pretty Decent for What it is,"Very awesome graphics in this game, decent game play. My only problem is that I got bored with it after awhile and some of those special moves are incredibly difficult to pull off when you have one of the characters coming at you with full force. Over all, decent for kids - kinda dull for adults."
5,"first year culinary student, first day review","I bought this knife at the last minute because my 8"" Henckels chef's knife didn't meet the 10"" requirement I needed for class. This knife is solidly constructed, well-weighted and very workable. Most of the students bought a knife kit the school had assembled from a local supplier and this knife has twice the heft of the full tang 10"" chef's knives in the school kit. The contemporary handle looks more comfortable than the traditional style but I don't really use the handle to cut so I can't really speak to whether it's ""better"" or not. This knife has a respectable blade and it's heavy enough to power through all the classical cuts you'd ever need to do. It may not last to get passed along to the grandkids (as maybe the Henckels will) but at this price, I'd highly recommend this particular knife for your consideration. It will stand up to professional use and it will certainly perform in the home kitchen."
5,"Fantastic product, stays sharp, looks great","I bought a complete set of these knives almost a year ago--and the 10-inch chef's knife based on the previous reviewer's recommendation. I have to double that rec--it's everything he says and more. The extra length of the ten-inch blade is just enough for cutting through large pizzas, focaccia, frittatas, etc., plus slicing large meats. The knives have been durable and have a wonderful hand as well. Feels good to hold, great balance, great looks. And I run them through the dishwashwer too!"
5,Wow - English written in English,I can't believe people moan about the fact that this is written in English when British people have to put up with everything IT related written in American.Welcome to the real world !
3,"High price book, minimal value","I was hoping to receive a really good reference book for BO 5.1, but that's not what I found. The book is a very basic guide that offers minimal value, yet is very expensive.There are tons of grammatical and spelling errors that make you wonder who proofread it before publishing.If you want a very basic introductory into BO reporting, this book may be useful to you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a more intermediate or advanced reference, search for another source."
1,Disappointed,"Is this a book? Once I got used to the typos and weird European grammar, I realized that there was nothing to this book. It is so simple that I had more questions after reading it then when I started. Luckily, I purchased another book at the same time and it has answered most of my questions."
2,Would not buy this one again!,- Connectors rusty- Did not like the way the connector clamped on the jacket of the cable.- Was hard to assemble.- Let's hope is dosn't fall apart!
3,"30amp plug, no markings","The condition of the plug was fine, it is just that at the wire connections to the plug, there are no identifying locators such as black,white,green,or red."
3,Just an obersvation,The title of the ad calls the plug a L14-30P. The verbage calls it a L14-20p(20amp) I have both plugs in the shop and they will not interchange unless I'm missing something. All of the consumer model portable generators that I have messed with have a L14-30P receptical in addittion to 120 recepticals. The correct male connector is more expensive than the L14-20P. Just be careful.
3,plug,"plug is okay for the money. insert gasket for wire is to tight and comes off when inserting wire, but plug serves its purpose"
1,Piece of garbage,"Very inferior plug. Would not recommend this at all. Shoddy construction, not up to par with other plugs. Screws were stripped and do not line up with holes properly."
1,Very unhappy customer!,I received the product broken. E-mailed the company twice. Got no response either time. I will never purchase anything from the company again nor will I use Amazon.com ever again. I am an extremely dis-satisfied customer.
5,"Great book, be sure to buy the 3rd Edition","This is a great book, but make sure you're getting the latest edition. The author published a 3rd edition in October 2005, which you can find on Amazon by searching for ISBN 0782144470."
1,hardcore horrors with hardcore problems,cheesy plots but that's ok the problem is the sound tracking was so far off the voices did not match up with the actors if it was a flowing scene. at first it was funny than it got to be very annoying!
1,"awful, to say the least","films that have the writer,producer,director,and starting roles should ring a bell that its not going to click with horror fans looking for good acting and realism."
4,What's it going to be like?,"The day my childbirth class was to start I was put on bed rest. Although I had read a lot about pregnancy and birth, I still didn't really know what it would feel like to have a baby. Reading these accounts of births helped a lot -- I felt I was much better prepared for the experience. I also liked Labor Day, edited by Ann-Marie Giglio, but that collection was relentlessly positive. This book include stories from women who weren't thrilled with their experiences, which seemed more honest.The stories are organized by where the birth occurred: hospital, birthing center, home. Reading the different accounts reassured me that I had chosen the location that was right for me.I'd recommend this book for anyone wondering what it's like to give birth."
2,THESE ARE MID 1980s RE-RECORDINGS - NOT ORIGINALS,"If you want the original Petula Clark 1960s classic recordings, then buy ""Ultimate Petula Clark"" or ""Platinum & Gold"" on BMG or ""Petula Clark Anthology"" on Hip-O/Univeral or one of the Sanctuary/Castle collections."
2,Why fix it if it ain't broke !,"I was expecting a compilation of Petula's hits from the 60's. What is on this CD are recently re-recorded versions of her songs. Petula's voice is a clear as ever, but the arrangements are somewhat different. When you are used to hearing the original verions of these songs, it is a bit of a disappointment."
1,"Sadly, a disappointment","If you are expecting to hear the original hit recordings, then don't buy this CD. Sure, it's Petula Clark singing, but the arrangements are slightly different, so the songs won't sound as good as the original hit recordings. I bought it, listened to it, but I don't plan to keep it in my collection. Instead, I plan to wrap it and use it in a White Elephant Christmas Gift Exchange, where we give away stuff we don't want anymore, but don't want to discard."
1,Not good,"I've bought and listened to other Roy Rogers and Sons of the Pioneers cds, this rates at the lowest. Sorry to say, I found the music to be too polished and very bland. I only liked a few songs of this collection. Most songs don't have the old time sound that to me make the sons of the pioneers who they were. Save yourself some money and the pain of having to listen to every track hoping somehow, somewhere you'll like a song."
3,"Bedtime stories? Some, not all.","As usual Richard Scarry's illustrations are wonderful. However, the first story in this book is about pirates and a ""ferocious monster"". Not sure why you would include a story like this before bedtime?? The other stories are fine, but if your child gets scared easily maybe the other stories would be better."
3,Not really bedtime stories....,"Ordered this for our two and a half year old. He likes the stories and they are indeed cute stories but they are not bedtime related stories which is what we were expecting. Of course, ANY story could be a bedtime story which I'm sure is what the compilers of this book had going on."
1,Poor formatting ruins this,"I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of this book - despite being a picture book, the text is independent of the pictures and the pictures are tiny on an iPad. As far as kids go, it's a sad excuse for a book. Not worth buying and I'm sorely disappointed in the quality of the experience. Save your money."
3,confusing little book for my 2 year old,a confusing little book for my 2 year old who loves richard scarry books. ended up returned it. Should have bought the $10.99 hardcover book.
1,Bed Time Stories with the Aminals,"Mr Scarry was my children's favorite author. Again, as I read Richard Scarry's books to my grandchildren they loved every character. There was a clear cut character trait and lesson on life to be learned. I bought this book expecting to find my friend Richard Scarry but, this did not even sound like his other books. I was very disappointed. Will I buy another Richard Scarry book. Probably not."
2,Review for the Kindle Fire readers,"I loved Scarry's books as a child. So, I was excited to see this advertised as one of the ""Kindle Fire Books for Children."" I am very disappointed on the formatting of the ebook. The pictures are tiny. In addition, there are some pages that are only text, that correspond to the picture-only page before it. My 2.5 year old son wants to turn the page to the next picture before I'm done with the text. Stick to buying the real book."
5,A superb work,"This is one of the richest orchestral works I have ever heard. Not only because of the impressive number of instruments used but also because of the variety of styles. Like Rosenman says it stands alone as a musical work, but if you enjoyed the soundtrack when viewing the film you will love this. There is much more to be heard in this digital, stereophonic version! Oh yes, this is a marvelously orchestrated score. And you can actually understand what the male choruses are singing: Mooorrr-dooorrr... Very creepy indeed. Those who appreciate contemporary classical music will be pleased as well. To top it off, the sound quality is top notch. Oh yes, this CD is awesome: if this is tempting you in the least bit, DO NOT HESITATE! You will be blown away."
3,could be better...,"Now, I have this movie, and that could be better, and so could be the soundtrack. While this CD has interesting song titles (aka. Gandalf Throws Ring and Trying To Kill Hobbits), the song I'd say is my favorite would be Helm's Deep, a (slightly strange) battle piece. It is filled with unusual choral-er-eruptions. Another song I like is Mithrandir, an almost angelic song deticated to Gandalf. Summary= it could be better."
1,read carefully,"While this looks like the ""original soundtrack"", Read carefully and note that this is a Japanese reissue and doesn't sound anything like the soundtrack I was anticipating from the movie. My error in not reading the details, but the CD cover and wording of the page are somewhat misleading."
4,A bit heavy,This album is a strange mix of new age music with slightly Arabic (read Turkish) influences but not in the traditional sense. It is a beautiful album but not suited for every occasion so to speak.
4,Hit the road driving at night with this thing in,"You will notice it differs considerably from Chroma Key. And you will have a really hard time into it if you are a Dream Theater fan. Also, remember this is a soundtrack, not an album with 5 min or so tracks. And add to it the fact that the movie is somewhat weird, beginning with the country it comes from. I haven't seen it (don't plan to), but still the music in this soundtrack reflects KM's current ethereal, surreal, ambient, meditative and somewhat esoteric style. I can only recommend this for people with a VERY WIDE musical and artistic sensibility. I'm not saying I have it, but just to warn you."
5,Practical and Mathematical,Clearly explains the fundamentals of the subject from a scienctific and a mathematical perspective. It is useful for students and researchers of many engineering backgrounds.
3,"Decent, but too cheesy.","The book was decent. The romance was sweet and I especially liked the father/son bonding that took place. The problem was the dialogue was a little trite, and the characters too square.I usually really enjoy Dinah McCall / Sharon Sala stories. This book just seemed too pat for me. It is a fast read, and the plot twist at the end was interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a little romance and doesn't mind suspending reality for a while."
1,Extremely Disappointed!,"I expected the author, at the very least, to be consistent about how smart the hero was. If his experience, gut and survival instincts allow him to conclude that a drug dealer (that fooled the entire staff of a federal prison) was faking his death, then I'm sure he would be smart enough to think twice about anyone working in the government (since he knows there is a mole.) I am extremely disappointed when I figure something out at the beginning of the book (the identity of the mysterious traitor known as the Snowman) that I hope will twist in the end but doesn't. Is it too much to ask that one of the best CIA agents (with the paranoid survival skills I don't have) is smarter about his own safety (as well as that of those he loves) than I am?"
5,"Excellent value, vintage style, beautiful finish",Vintage styling complements my older home as does the beautiful polished nickel finish. Polished nickel fixtures are scarce and expensive and often starkly modern. This unit is a welcome difference - polished nickel with lovely lines at a good price.
4,Excellent Book!,"This book has an excellent blend of the practical and theoretical aspects of the wireless and cellular scenario. A must read for all graduate students and Professors to obtain the ""big picture"" of this fast emerging and important area."
5,wave propagation characteristics,The textbook is very useful for who want to learn more about UHF propagation within indoor environment.The professor is very good at teaching and researching.
2,Not very helpful,This book was not very helpful in my preparations for the PMP exam (which I just passed). The style of the questions is not anything like the exam and the materials focused mainly on the PMBOK rather than a wider view of all PM concepts. I would not recommend spending the money for this book...rather spend you money on the ESI materials and sample tests.UPDATE:The ESI materials are:PMP CHALLENGE by Ward (published by ESI International)PMP EXAM: PRACTICE TEST by Ward (also published by ESI)
3,Not so great PMP prep book,"This is not a very useful book for preparing for the PMP exam. The answer format does not match the actual exam, e.g. (A) I and II only, (B) I, II and III only, (C) IV only, etc. The actual exam does not follow this format ... maybe the older exams did. There are four possible answers for each question on the exam, not five as it is in this book. Several questions/answers were taken pretty much word for word from the PMBOK rather than well crafted questions which force you to think instead of simply memorizing the answers."
4,Project management,For a step by step overview of project management PMBOK is the way to go. PMBOK is very informitive and shows you how to organize the chaos of running a project. It anticipates your needs as a manager and tells you how to overcome the potential obsticles.
3,"Good, but","Sometimes a little too terse. It's occasionally hard to figure out what is going on (or how old the narrator is, or what he's doing or where he is). A nice little introduction to northern Michigan, though."
5,EXCELENT CD,"THIS CD FROM LOUDNESS IS THERE FIRST ENGLISH SPOKEN OFFERING. THE SINGING IS VERY GOOD ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. MINORU HAS A DECENT COMMAND OF HIS STYLING'S AND THERE ISNT MUCH LOST IN THE TRANSLATION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE REST OF THE REVIEWS ON THIS CD THEY WILL PROBABLY STATE THE SAME THING .................""ONE OF THE BEST"". PICK IT UP AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY. P.S. THE GUITAR SOLO ON CRAZY DOCTOR IS OUT OF CONTROL. THE SONG AND SOLO ALONE ARE WORTH THE PRICE OF THIS CD. DONT MISS THIS ONE KIDDIES!!!!!"
5,The most useful thing in my kitchen!,"I didn't know how much I needed this knife until I had it. This is my first ""good"" knife, and boy does it make a difference. For a long time I had heard that one good knife can be your most useful tool in the kitchen, and it is the truth! I used to be a kitchen gadget collector, but I use this knife for a lot of the things that I used to have gadgets for (frees up a lot of space in my kitchen!) I also invested in a sharpener, and try to sharpen the knife every three or four uses.The balance of this knife is great, and it fits my hand perfectly. It was a little heavier than I anticipated, but I got used to that very quickly. This knife has replaced most of my other cheap knives, and I don't miss them a bit."
5,Better than I expected!,"After I bought my Calphalon cookware I knew I would continue to buy their products because they are very good quality, especially for the price. I know their cookware & kitchen utensils are good, but I wasn't sure about their cutlery (some companies make quality cookware but poor quality knives). So I decided to take a chance & get the 8"" Chef's knife and I am so glad I did! I think this knife is beautiful & the perfect weight. I really like the handle & it feels nice and balanced in my hand. It didn't come out of the box quite as sharp as I'd like it to be, but it's definitely sharp enough. I can't wait to get more knives & the maple block! This knife is great for everyday use!!"
5,The Knife that Converted Me,"I was using ""regular"" knives, nameless utensils that cut things for me, until I bought this knife as part of a set that was on sale. The first time I used it, I saw the light. This knife was sharp, fit beautifully in my hand and made cutting much less of a chore. We've since purchased several other knives in this line, but this one holds a special place in my heart.Though we've been using it for several years, it's only been sharpened occasionally and the only sign of wear is that the Calphalon insignia that was on the blade has worn off after many washings. Compared to more expensive brands, like Wusthof, these knives are an incredible value."
3,STEVIE RAY & ERIC CLAPTON CLONE,BECAUSE OF GREAT LOVE FOR SVR AND EC I REALLY ENJOYED THIS CD. LOT OF SINGING FOLLOWED BY ALOT OF GUITAR RIFFS.TO ME IF YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES YOU WOULD THINK I WAS ON EC CD
1,blech,"I'm NOT new to blues and over the years have heard some of the best players around.Sadly, ""Blue Drops of Rain"" doesn't even come close to a ""blues"" CD. Pushing further, I'm not sure that it deserves being considered even a bad musical attempt at blues.I've found that, with the new digital tech. equipment, virtually anyone can make a CD nowdays. This is a pretty good example of why this artistic freedom is NOT a good thing. Make a CD, manufacture it yourself and push it on the market.Frankly, I'm pretty disgusted with this one."
3,Not great/not bad,"Corey never really convinces me that he's 100% committed to the material on this CD. There are some fine moments but some equally disappointing moments as well. He seems to be searching maybe a bit too hard for an identity here. The SRV look is a bit much in my opinion. That being said, he is not the ""blues anti-christ"" as other reviewers might lead you to believe. Playing music outside of the standard blues realm is really OK. There are other just as legitimate forms of music. Most of these self-proclaimed ""blues lovers (translation - EXPERTS)"" wouldn't know it if they were beat over the head with a National Steel anyway. Corey followed this effort up with a much more identifiable release, ""Road To Zen"". That release is not a blues CD but has alot of good rocking, fun moments. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this particular release but I wouldn't avoid it either."
5,Corey Steven Ray Vaughn???,"The look, the hair, the sideburns, the little ""v"" shaped beard, the sound, the phrasing, the voice, they're all Stevie Ray Vaughn. Currently, I'm listening to track 8, ""Lenny"". It could have been called ""'Little Wing' as done by SRV was cool, and I want to emulate him so bad!"" He picked a good artist to emulate, I guess that's something. There's something missing... Let's see... Oh yes, that's it! Originality."
5,Great Blues Rock,"This is what blues rock is all about.Great rockin' blues and beautiful ballads.Great vocal and guitar,I can't recomend this cd enough."
3,Not Quite,"I was enthused about this book when I bought it, and have been pleased with how the recipes I tried turned out. However, I have to take issue with the use of the word ""Healthful"" in the title, because some of the dishes contain too much oil and other fats to be considered healthful in my book. I still managed to get good results while using less oil, etc. than the recipes suggest. The recipes are good, but if you are watching your fat intake, be forewarned."
5,An outstanding cookbook,"I have a lot of vegetarian cookbooks but recipe for recipe this one never fails to succeed. The ingredients are simple, the instructions straightforward and the results can't be beat. The author primarily uses tofu, seitan, tempeh and lots of other recipes that use beans, pasta, etc. She has a chapter on one pot meals which is great when you want to keep things simple. The only thing I don't like about this book is the title. The recipes are so outstanding that this is really a gourmet book but you'd never know it from the title!"
3,Not a vegan cookbook!,"I was disappointed to see that this book was not advertised as a solely vegetarian cookbook. Though no egg recipes seen so far, give this a miss if you're looking for a guide without all the dairy references"
5,Wonderful,"This is one of those classics that everyone should see. There was a movie a few years ago that as I watched I saw a lot of the storyline from ""It Happened One Night."" Needless to say remakes are never as good as the originals. If you are a Gable fan you can't miss this one. It just never gets old."
5,It still sparkles,"What's not to like with this classic, original screwball comedy? It still holds up after all this time, and Clark Gable is as sexy as ever with those pervasive dimples and ironic grin.If you crave some real star quality, some Hollywood [as well as American] history, get this film now. The chemistry between Gable and Colbert makes this movie hum, and compared to the drek we get today both in our ""stars"" and the scripts, it is a stellar piece of art.Heartily recommended!"
4,Classic,I love old movies and this s an oldie. Classic actors and a lovely story. A must watch. Would recommend.
5,Classic classic movie,One of my all time favorites excellent video quality great story line and classic actors. I highly recommend this movie. Beware though I had bought an earlier one that has a color cover on it and it is so dark that some scenes are hard to see details of any kind. This black cover one is from the film co. and the quality is excellent.
5,A classic!,"Truely a classic movie that any film fan, and definitely any Clark Gable fan, should own. It never seems to go out of style or seem dated. I enjoy it every time I see it."
5,IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES...IT ALSO HAS JANET GAINER IN IT. YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE IF YOU LOVE OLD MOVIES LIKE I DO!!
5,"A charming, witty classic!","What a fun movie! The prototypical ""road flick"", this just isn't to be missed. The script is clever, the leads have wonderful synergy and spot-on timing (particularly Mr. Gable)."
3,"Cute movie, but the download is another story.","The storyline of the movie is a cute romantic comedy. But the download has issues. If I pause, FF, RW, stop and come back to it they all have the same issue. That issue is that the audio will continue to play as normal but the picture is frozen on the screen. If you move the video bar, same story audio will start to play but the picture is frozen. Kinda annoying."
5,"""A Great Classic""","If you have never seen this movie, go get it! It's truly an enduring movie and a masterpiece for all times. My brother said that back when you didn't have special effects and explosions, all you could rely on was the charm and talent of the actors/actresses and the wit of the dialogue between them. Nothing else can explain this movie better. There is no doubt that this movie was and is influential. I only wish that it was available in widescreen (I hope the status of the original reel is okay)..."
5,Love it.,"This is a great Frank Capra film. Gable is fantastic and so is his leading lady, who was a bigger star than he was at the time.Copy is clean and looks much better than others that I had seen. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the transfer. I have watched it several times and enjoy having this classic in my collection."
5,Wonderful Classic - A must have!,"I'm so glad this is out on DVD. The quality of the picture is excellent! Extras on the DVD are a nice added feature. This is a wonderful classic you must have! They don't call it the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"" for nothing! Simply the best! Highly recommend you also get Jean Arthur's films ""You can't take it with you"" and ""The more the merrier""."
4,Review of the SACD content of A Treasury,"It's already been discussed on what should of been include / removed from this collection, so I will just talk about the improved sound and 5.1 mix. The stereo SACD lived up to my expectations to the format, the songs had the a warm quality that I expected. The improved sound was noticeable even on the ""new"" version of Magic (as listed on the cd), I noticed some distortion and background noise on the cd version of the track but not on the SACD. The 5.1 mix I thought were well done, even with the acoustic tracks such as Black Eyed Dog. The vocals are mixed in the center channel and the rear channels and the guitar is in front and rear channels. Other SCAD with just acoustic/vocal tracks just had a three channel mix, which didn't add much over the original stereo mix. Anyway I give the sound 5 stars and the song selection 4 stars."
1,Bad Experience,"I purchased this SACD version of Nick Drake - A Treasury and looked forward to hearing his material in this format. Popped it in my SACD player and it would not load. So I went through the proper steps to return this and get a replacement copy. All of this was expedited quickly. I received the replacement only to have the same problem. I thought I'd save Amazon and myself the trouble of going through the return steps again and included both CD's in the same package. I assumed they would understand what the deal was, but that's what I get for assuming. I was credited $2.87 cents for the shipping charges and still have no disc or credit. Thanks"
4,Great filter replacement.,"I bought this filter 5 months ago to replace my ITG free flow filter that crumbled. This K&N, like any K&N I have used before is excellent quality and functionality."
5,What a man!,This is an excellent recording! I heard about Craig David and thought I'd check him out and it sure was worth it! Even though the CD doesn't have much tracks I love it anyway because the tracks that it has it has!
5,Wow! I was looking for just this kit!,"I got an issue of a German women's magazine Freundin and theyfeatured this Booklover's Repair Kit. I'd been looking all over for a proper set of materials to repair some old bindings. This is simply brilliant.It would take me many trips or orders by mail, phone or internet to assemble all these necessary items. Not only is everything you need in this kit, but you can also use it to make your own bookbindings (you need some kind of press, but that can be a piece of wood and some clamps, and a bone folder which can be found in craft stores that carry scrapbooking items.) If you like to scrapbook or do your own journal OR if you collect old books, this kit is a must."
4,Makes a stunning gift for the book lover in your life,"This kit comes beautifully packaged in a very sturdy, compartmentalized box. The hardcover book with the set is lovely as well as helpful and clear. The supplies are useful - yes, some things (like the glue stick) you could get at your local office supply store, but many other included supplies are more difficult to come by and are very high quality.As for the issue of whether or not you get real value for your money (given the high price tag) - I'll be honest. I bought this kit for less than half the ordinary retail price, so I'm extremely happy with it and feel that I got my money's worth. Had I paid over $100, I'd be a little disappointed."
1,Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With Great Respect and Love,"All respect for ones path and their own interpretation. Please people stop writing bastardized versions of the ancient texts. This book is just that. Most the meaning is lost and this is what is being taught. A very beautifully poetic version that has little value or meaning of the depth of the original text. If you want a real translation please check out Swami Hariharananda Aranya's translation. If you can understand the deep version keep reading it over and over and practice. It comes with practice not watering it down for the masses. The depth of info is only meant for those that can transcend and embody. Tapas, tapas, tapas.Hari Om"
5,AMERICA'S BOY: A Memoir,"Great book, couldn't put it down. Interesting some funny some real life. Now I am reading the rest of Wade Rouse books. Good reading"
5,"Sweet, sad, funny, icky memoir.","I just stumbled upon this book and it looked like something I would enjoy. What an understatement, I LOVE this book. It made me laugh out loud as well as squirm in discomfort. I read a lot, and Wade's book captivated me more than anything else I've read recently. For the reviewer here who says ""he doesn't get all the facts right"" - well, who cares. Write your own memoir. Same to the guy who says ""my family is funnier."" The important thing is Wade wrote it down and published it, and it's awesome. America's Boy made me start asking my husband questions about his own brother who died (who was also gay), and really led to some deep conversations that we have never had before. That's what a great book does."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Just shows what great cover art will do for a book. I bought it impulsively based on the great graphic on the jacket. Ooops, that was the first and last time. It is also the first and last time I buy a book based on the collective start rating on Amazon. Who reviews these books, 14 year olds?I found this book hard to finish as it just didn't seem ""authentic"". I had a hard time relating to many aspects of the main character as he just didn't feel ""real"" to me. I also had a hard time with the way he rushed to finish the book and tidy up his life in a nice little package.Perhaps if you grew up gay in the midwest during the 70s/80s you can relate to this book but the only decent part was his description of his relationship to his relatives. Like most ""coming out"" novels this one seems to be another self absorbed recount of a fairly boring life."
1,I couldn't even finish this book,200 pages into this book I just couldn't take any more of it. I didn't care about the main character at all and the story was horribly boring. My family is funnier and more interesting than this group of people. I felt the stories were forced and not even worth telling. For the first 20 or so pages I thought I was going to really enjoy this book but after that each page got harder and harder to turn.I can usually find merit in any book - making it worth reading for some reason - but I would have to search far and wide to suggest reading this book. Maybe if you are serving life in prison - this book could be more interesting than staring at the walls. Skip it!
4,1970s Midwest is Best,"What a sweet, well-written book. And I don't think I say this because I grew up in a small town in Iowa around the same time period and so many cultural and corner-of-the-country references resonate with me. The story was poignant without being sappy; just a sweet memory of childhood, really, despite the nonheavy handedness (as dealt with here) coming out questions and the sadness and death surrounding the middle part of the story. I'll admit I found the transformation into a partying, kinda shallow-seeming gay man in the big city a little abrupt. Couldn't see much of the child in the man. And the author loses my sympathy over his admitted shoddy treatment of women. Kudos for honesty. Writing style kind of ran out of steam at the end, and the short ""chapters"" started to bug, especially once we were out of the Ozarks. But really well worth the read."
3,"Not bad, but not the best",The Mother was recommended to me by friend so I purchased it. I expected it to be much better since my friend thought I'd enjoy it. I have to say I was a bit disappointed and felt it could have been an excellent film if it had only been a bit more thought out.
5,The Mother,"Extremely well acted. Hardly a chick flick! Subtle and intriguing. Anne Reid is excellent in the title role, but who would ever have thought that Daniel Craig would go on to play James Bond?!! Worth the money!"
3,An odd kind of romance,"The recently widowed mother takes up with a young carpenter who is already having a fling with her daughter. Um...wow. If you can believe that, you can get through the rest. The acting is quite good; it is just a very odd kind of romance."
4,Family Drama,"Not often does a film evoke such memories of true family life. Moments of tenderness are outweighed by tension, secrets and bad behavior. A great commentary on the family experience behind closed doors. Anne Reid and Daniel Craig are fabulous (very bold, daring and erotic). Wonderfully written."
5,"Cool Songs, Good Music","Love this CD. My daughter (8 years old) enjoys listening to it. All the songs are positive and kid friendly. Many songs about self esteem, confidence and friendship."
4,Bratz Diamonds CD,"My 12 year old loves this CD.Unfortunately even though it was advertised as new,there was no bracelet.Not only that but 2 songs are mysteriously missing from the CD,My younger daughter has the CD and that included all the songs and bracelet so this is how I know.Seeming this is a review and not Feedback,I will just say this is a great CD for teen girls!"
5,soothing duo,"Some musicians just don't bother to pigeonhole their music as 'jazz' or 'blues' or whatever...They just play, and try to put their message across...This is such a record, with a relaxing, soothing blend of vintage jazz and blues...Perfect for a long, smooth drink of whisky...and maybe even a cigar...Health freaks, please excuse my lowdown wicked ways."
2,They don't wear well over time.,"I love the knife set that came with these shears, but these haven't worn well. I've had them for about 3 years and they have gotten very stiff and difficult to use. I have treated them carefully and usually hand wash them. Can't figure out how to take them apart to clean them more effectively. Would not get them again. I will be contacting the company."
2,Olive did not do it right...,"Even though WUSA is a downer, to say the least, one should be able to enjoy the DVD, right? Wrong! Even though the video is 2.35:1 and visually great, the audio leaves something to be desired. The audio is in 1 channel and one either gets drowned out by the music OR cannot hear the actors. The audio dialogue is at a very low volume and yet the music drowns out any dialogue. There is even a scene between Newman and Woodward where the dialogue is drowned out by a fountain. It might be tolerable IF there were subtitles...but there are NO subtitles! Paramount has leased several of its titles to Olive Films. That would be great if the quality stood up to Paramount's. But in this case, it doesn't. Olive did not do it right...in my opinion. This was a very disappointing experience."
3,"Ok, but, not great - Consider the Fiskars 1400 DuraSharp #7","I was looking for a reasonably inexpensive par of sheers for cutting hair. These will do the job, but, I think the Fiskars 1400 DuraSharp No 7 Barber Scissors at about half the price do a better job. The Fiskars are not serrated like the Mundial sheers, so the cutting action is a tad smoother. Of course, you can spend a lot more on hair cutting sheers as well..."
5,Like the other 8 reviews so far have said: 5 stars,"I have read the second edition and recently bought this third edition that has ANSI standard C in the main body of the work, rather than K&R; C. I am using it to brush up on C that I have not used in a while. It is still a great book.I have read the other reviews from December 1997 through February 2004. I do not have much to add to what has already been said, other than what the others write is true. I wish all technical books were this well written."
4,Pull String Woody,My little grand sons are really into Toy Story and Woody completed their figures from the movie. I think my son enjoys it as much as the little ones do.
4,Eensy-Weensy Spider in the Middle of the Night!,"Fantastic book for kids of all ages! I love it as much as my three-year-old grandchildren do, and every time we get this book out, they want me to read it several times. The fabulous colorful pictures are fun for the kids and for me, and are detailed enough to give us lots to talk about on each page, but not so detailed as to overwhelm young eyes. The only problem I have with Eensy-Weensy Spider is that I find it running through my mind at odd times, including when I wake in the middle of the night!I just changed my rating of this book from 5 stars to 4 stars because the cover came off after just a few uses. I'm not talking about a dust jacket, but the actual cover of the book. Still a fun book to read, but I hesitate to order others in the series because I'm disappointed with how the book was put together."
5,Get this to give.,"The pictures are really charming, and there are lots of fun verses. This with Miss Mary Mack makes a good baby present."
5,Best pic's from the beautiful & hard to find Bhakti Point,"Hauntingly mellow & yet at times upbeat, this is a best of selection of songs from a premire new age artist. The selections from his first & almost impossible to find first album 'Bhakti Point' is worth the price of this cd alone. Get it while you can, you won't be sorry."
2,obscene pictures drawn with permanent markers inside multiple pages,a lot of profanities and obscene pictures were written/drawn in permanent marker inside the pages of the textbook. it was awful but I guess that's what you get for when you purchase a used book. it's just that it was that cheap to warrant such defacing of important pages.
1,Be careful which used edition you order,"Be careful which edition you order. I ordered a used OLC Part III and received a green book. I've been using OLC for over 10 years and was completely unaware that the first edition was still around. If purchasing a used version, be sure you are aware which edition your seller is providing you."
5,I went back a bought more for gifts!,I loved this book. My 7 yr old couldn't put it down. Everytime he looked at it he saw something else. The colors were so beautilful. I know she had fun creating this book.
5,My Son loves this Book!,"My son loves this book. Our copy is old and torn because he has used it so much. He is 4 years old, but has been playing with it for over a year now. He loves the pulls and twists on each page and has a great time pointing to whatever child I am reading about. It is a fairly delicate book (rips easily in 3 year old hands) but he doesn't care that half the pages don't work. He still wants to read it at night. I will probably get him a new one this year since he is better able to care for it as he gets older. Definitely would recommend to others."
4,historybuff,"incredible amount of information and depth is presented in this book. however, some portions are extremely dry and monotonous especially when judt deals with politics, which is naturally a large portion of this book. nevertheless, it is an essential piece of literature for anyone who wants to learn more about europe"
4,An impressive tome,"Caution: this book is not for the faint of heart or the faint of butt. It looks long, and is actually even longer: the text is packed in very densely, with very small margins and thin paper. However, it is fascinating enough to overcome the initial ""it'll take me years to finish this!"" gut reaction. Very informative, very meaty."
2,No photos,"I expect that this is a very interesting book, as I have read Reappraisals by the same author.But the inset pages with photographs seem to be missing. I have leafed through all 960 pages. There are maps, but no photographs, but according to the Photo credits, there should be four inset sections with each 8 photographs.I hope this will be remedied!"
2,Too much opinion.,"Lots of facts and lots of opinion, some of which I didnt agree with. I was hoping for a more unbiased account."
3,"Postwar, by Tony Judt","Tony Judt's Postwar deserves the praise it gets. But why no sources?That absence is a grave defect. No bibliography, no essay on archivalsources, no notes to documents. We have to take it all on trust andJudt's reputation. That it's meant for a popular audience is no excuse.I just finished Timothy Snyder's Bloodlands,also good for a popular audience, and it is fully documented."
4,"Excellent, inclusive, a bit l ong-winded",For some reason the modern history of Europe doesn't seem to catch the attention of many writers so I was glad when I saw this book. Most of what I know about Europe in this century revolves around either of the two world wars. I think Judt does a great job of filling in the blanks. I especially like that this history concerns all of Europe - so many books focus on France or Germany or England and leave out the likes of Czechoslovakia or other `lesser' countries. The book is long and not always easy reading as would be expected with a book of this breadth. Judt does an admirable job with such a complex and detailed topic. I think that the history of Europe as a block is just beginning and this is a great foundation to understanding how they got where they are and where they are going.
2,No source notes or bibliography--what's with that?,"Much as I admire Judt's writing and breadth of knowledge, I'm appalled that he allowed this book to appear without source notes and bibliography, which are relegated to a website. I imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript, but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers."
4,An Opus,"""Postwar"" by Tony Judt is a mammoth (960) opus written in text-book style, except for the odd and disappointing fact that no facts were footnoted. Beyond this decision, the actual facts presented present a view of post-WW II Europe that is balanced and detailed. Its coverage of East and West, and its discussion of the role of the US will create discussion for years to come.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of ""Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction"", ""Soul Physicians,"" and ""Spiritual Friends."""
2,Is this a joke?,"Can anyone please tell me why this book appears to have been HANDWRITTEN? Maybe someone thought it would just look cool to publish an entire book by photocopying Faulkner's notes. The book is somewhat useful and is good for translating certain stubborn Egyptian texts, but frankly I expected much more. The book seems literally thrown together. Add to this the fact that there is NO English to Egyptian cross-reference. You have to buy the supplemental reference at additional cost (review on that coming soon).An Egyptian hieroglyphic dictionary is the single most important tool a student can possess. Either the publishers have some specific copyright that prevents someone else from writing a similar dictionary, or there is simply no market for one because professors receive a kickback for requiring Faulkner's book. I recommend this book for one reason: It is the only one that exists."
3,"Love, sex, scandal, secrets...a great romance novel!","After reading, ""The Mists of Avalon"" over the holiday season, I was hooked on Arthurian Romance. I have also read the first book in Woolley's trilogy, Child of the Northern Spring. This book, Queen of the Summer Stars, starts out slow, but proves to be a good read after the first 100 pages or so. The romance between Guinevere and Lancelot heats up, and Arthur's secret reason for hating his sister, Morgause, is finally revealed (can't say too much more for fear of giving away all the really good parts). All in all, it was an enjoyable read. I would recommend it to other historical romance fans."
4,"Guinevere, Queen of Arthur","Enjoyable interpretation of the King Arthur legend where Guinevere isn't just a tragic character. She has strength, common sense and is a very realistic character."
4,Shows human side of Guinevere,"Ms.Wooley does a tremendous job of giving readers insight into the heart and mind of literature's most storied queen. Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere are fleshed out better than by any other Arthurian writer. If you read only one chronicle of Camelot, make it this one."
2,Didn't read it,"After attempting to read the first one and giving up, I didn't even attempt to read this one. I knew it was likely to be like the first one, Child of the Northern Spring."
2,Lost paragraphs,Persia woollens well written book should deserve five stars if only I had received it in its entirety. Several paragraphs or pages were missing lending incongruity to the train of thought.
4,Liked it,"Takes a while to get the story moving and for a while the plot seems a bit meandering. I skimmed over a lot of Gwen' s thoughtful reflections because frankly, I got bored of them. Otherwise, it's a sweet story with characters that are easy to love. Glad I read it and will be reading the last book."
5,Stocking stuffer,Wonderful. I bought this for my husband since it matched the lanyard I put in his stocking last Christmas. I already know he'll love it. Once he switches out his nfl lanyard in the spring I know he'll get asked about it at work. Yankee fans are everywhere!!!
4,Ridiculously funny,Bought several at Christmas for stocking stuffers. Kids and adults alike played and laughed at them. Some didn't flip right all the time no one really cared.
2,Wrong product shipped,I was supposed to get a monkey and I got a dog. It works well but the person I bought it for LOVES monkeys. It was not worth sending back.
3,Overpriced but works well.,"It is simple design and does what it is supposed to. Having said that, this thing is incredibly overpriced for what it is. With shipping I paid $40 for a wire separator, totally ridiculous."
1,National Geo Southern Appalachian Mtns Explorer Software,The software shown for sale is out of date. It is not the latest version. The new version includes the Pisgah Ranger District of the Pisgah National Forest. Amazon should inform its customers that it is selling out of date software.
2,Southern Appalachian Explorer,"The software function is very good. The maps used in the application are very detailed and the tools allow a user to create custom trips and hikes and provides very helpful details and info on the trips created. Unfortunately, this package was purchased to use while traveling on the Blue Ridge Parkway, which is claimed to be covered. But there are major gaps in the Parkway in two of the most interesting areas. The company was contacted and they replied that they are not planning on making any upgrades to the program or expanding the coverage area. I really like the app, and very disappointed that it doesn't cover all the area advertised. The Blue Ridge is the heart of the Appalachians, and the AT is a major part of the hiking system there."
3,"Pretty good, but...","I'm a Bosch tool fan but this router disappoints in several ways:1. The switch is not located in a convenient location, and it's too small.2. The handles on the plunge base are getting loose & sloppy.3. The dust collection hood is absolute cheap plastic junk, and poorly designed. It will break on you in short order.4. Don't like the fact that I have to use two collet wrenches to change bits - other routers have a single-wrench system that is more convenient.Other than that... not a bad tool."
2,WHERE'S THE BEEF?,"Amy Gerstler seems to be missing a left brain. Her half-baked meanderings are mere word play, not poetry in the true sense. If you get a buzz from words alone (and don't give a damn about a poem's meaning - or lack of it) skip Gerstler and read Sexton or Ashbery. They dazzle. It's hard to see Ghost Girl when she's wearing the Emperor's clothes."
1,Worse quality- scam - Becareful,"It said, its water resistant but in rainy days it got misty, fogy thing which stays inside the watch atleast for 2 weeks and make it hard to see time..."
5,Tear jerker,"I bought this book for my daughter. The Dear America books are good books for young girls to read. I do recommend the book, One Eye Laughing, The Other Weeping. This book will make you cry. My daughter wasn't sure if she could even finish the book, but she couldn't put it down."
3,My Fascination Was Not Encouraged By This Book- Mary Sanders,"I am Mary Sanders, a 14 year old reader from Cabridge Massachusetts. I LOVE reading about the occult, and since I am a New Englander, grew up hearing all about the Saleb Witch Trials-which fascinates me greatly. I was overjoyed when I heard the Dear America series was coming out with a book about the Salem Witch Trials. However, when I read it I was quite disappointed. For, this book just describes daily life of the puritans, which I expected only little of that to be mentioned in this book and not enough about witches.[...]"
5,Great book!,"I bought this book when it first came out because it sounded really interesting. It was.I've been studying about the Salem Witch Trials for awhile now, and this was a neat addition to the collection of info.It's very realistic, there's only a few things made up, and it hits pretty close to home.For instance, a close friend of the family is being accused of being a witch, her sister's best friend is having the fits that inevitably send someone else to jail, and the author even managed to sneak in a bit of romance.It's very interesting and I'm giving it a 5 star rating."
3,"Does well, but doesn't cut well!","I purchased this masking product so that it would make taping and masking a breeze. I usually use a sprayer to paint, and you must protect everything from overspray.This product does a great job at putting the tape and the plastic out at the same exact time. I don't know if I just need more experience, but I have difficulties trying to tear the plastic from the roller. I'm sure there's a trick to it, but it seems like whenever I do, I just end up with what looks like a torn apart plastic bag. To prevent this, I usually use a utility knife to just slice the plastic away. This works well, but that is the only thing wrong that I don't like about this product."
1,Rented in Error... what a waste.,I rented in error. Watched a bit just to save face. This movie is a waste of money. Cheaply done junk.
1,CnC 3 bummer,"Nothing against Amazon but I ordered this through Amazon and received the game in a week. That was a good thing. I put the disk in to install the game and it was blank. Bad thing. I went through the return procedure online and sent disk back. Amazon was quick to send out a replacement to me with no further costs to me. Good thing. When I got the 2nd disk and tried to install, it too was blank. Bad again. Again, sent it back to Amazon and my account was credited. No money lost for me but now the game was selling for $5.00 more. Do I try a third time with Amazon? No, I went and purchased the game locally. The game is FANTASTIC! The game from Amazon - well, it didn't happen 2 times. I hope they got the problem resolved with their distributor."
2,Unplayable Online,"Good game, very fun to play, very fast paced. Not huge emphasis on micro management which is good IMO.I would give this game 4+ stars if the online interface wasn't so bad. On the rare occasion I would actually get a game started I would get kicked off-line afterwards only to find my previous win wasn't recorded. You see a bunch of people with a {0} after their screename, it's because they are logged in twice due to some sort of network problems.Also, you need to create an account online w/ EA games and you need .NET Framework installed to play online. Oh and if you are trying to find a friends game on the list and it's not at the top good luck, the game list is constantly refreshing and every time it does it brings you back to the top of the list, very frustrating.This game has the potential to be a great RTS granted they fix online play."
1,Didn't work in Windows 7,"I installed this on a new computer with windows 7 64 bit ultimate and I couldn't get the game to work. I get an error message on my monitor 'unsupported screen resolution'. I have a regular 1920x1200 monitor that as far as I know supports everything but 2560x1600. I couldn't get to the screen to set options, so I couldn't change the resolution.On my old vista computer it worked fine and was fun to play. Just beware if you plan on ever using on windows 7. Also, other games work fine in windows 7, so it's probably not my computer with the problem."
2,Boring game-play. Boring story-line. Just boring.,C&C3; is just boring. Reminds me of Red Alert 3. I am going to go back to playing Red Alert 2.I don't recommend trying C&C3; unless you have trouble sleeping. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep.
4,A must have for RTS fans,"Command & Conquer 3 is a definite ""must have"" for C&C and RTS fans all around. Once again, you get to choose whose side you want to fight for. The Global Defense Initiative or The Brotherhood of NOD. The graphics are great, you don't need a super computer to play and the controls are relatively easy. The only thing I didn't like about the game is after you beat it playing both sides, you unlock a third race called the Scrin. The army is cool but there are only 4 single player levels to their story mode. I can assume there will be an add-on coming out eventually."
2,Didn't meet expectation.,"Hello,I've played C&C; since the first one came out and I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately I'm really disappointed in C&C3.;Very short matches/skirmish. Average 8 - 20 minutes.The units are Cartoonish in style.The Map sizes are really small - Insuring a short match.As someone stated before you can have everything built in a matter of a few minutes, so your best units are out on the battlefield.I personally felt as if though the matches were more centered around the idea of who ever rushes first will win.If your a die hard C&C; Fan and really enjoy short RTS matches I would recommend you pick it up - I did. If your really into RTS that require real strategy / Huge Maps and tons of options. I would recommend other games such as Supreme Commander or even the Older Game of Generals Zero Hour I picked those up as well.Take Care and Good Luck RTSing."
2,"mediocre singly player, boring mulitplayer","The only improvements this game shows are the graphics and the addition of third race ""Scrin"". C&C games always sucked and will suck forever. The cutscenes between missions were unbelievably cheesy and boring (even though they used some famous actors/actresses) it was painful to watch them. I recommend getting World in Conflict."
3,Claustrophobic view but OK game,"The program does not allow you to zoom out to see a broad field of view. What's in the little view is nice - good animation, etc. - but every time there's action on the map you have to scroll around to find it. It gets frustrating. One would think a modern game could be programmed to trade off between graphics and width of field, but this game doesn't even try."
1,Don't Purchase !,"First I had problems installing the game. If you have Windows 7, you need to get on the internet and download missing files for the game to even run. Nothing new or outstanding, but even on the easy setting, the advanced missions are impossible. Excitement runs out very quickly."
3,Any help on this?,Does anybody know why this game will not work on my Dell 6400 laptop? It crashes about 5 minutes into gameplay back to windows. What I can tell of the game from what I have seen it is amazing with really good graphics but cannot review it to the full extent since I have not played the full game. Any help is appreciated and yes I know this is not a help forum but have done a lot of research with no good results.
3,dkb,still not as good as the original C&C its to much like ea sports generals.westwood was still the best
4,Good,It was a good time waster while deployed. If you are looking for a game to kill some time and have a decent system this is it. Long gone are the days of westwood studios and real games htat people spent time makeing.
3,story,"I have been a C and C for a long tine, yet this game does not follow the story ending of firestorm very well. While game play is great the story is lacking, it doesn't follow the ending of firestorm.Tech wise, we can forget units like subterranean tanks and hover units. The bansee and disrupter are gone, no Cyborg units and GDI's airforce sucks and is imbalance.For a good story go back to tiberian sun"
2,Boring,"Older CandC games kept me entertained for months but for some reason this one just bores me. I guess i just don't feel like im being challenged in any way. Only a basic level of strategy is involved and the units offer little in the way of variation. Build a few tanks, put some rocket-soldiers into an APC, send them off to war, job done. The graphics are great and a woman from Battlestar Galactica makes a few guest appearances but I'm afraid to say this game just doesnt live up to its legacy."
5,C&C 3:Tiberium Wars is Amazing,This game is by far the best since Red Alert 2. I like how they brought the movie clips back into the story. The graphics are so amazing on this game compared to the others. It's also cool how they stayed to the original story unlike Red Alert and the games after. I would definitly buy this game. It's worth it.
5,If you liked the last ones...,"Its basically again all the same but different. minor controls have changed for like the first time ever. Great new units, and strategies to go with them. Perhaps the best part tho, was seeing some recognizable faces from some of my favorite sci-fi's durring their great as usual between level videos. I also purchased supreme commander around the same time. based on the old total annihilation game, it goes a little farther as far as large scale troop control. But C&C wins hands down for graphics, in game and out. I only wish I could zoom out just a little farther. Its like they spent so long on the units they want to make sure you see all the details :)"
3,Calphalon made in China,"It may say Calphalon, but the knives say China.I have taken care of these knives really well and STILL I see rust on some of the knives....not the brand I was really hoping for but they do work really well if you keep them sharp."
2,not so great for the brand,"I was expecting calphalon quality, but these knives just don't feel like they are quality knives."
4,"Nice looking faucet, seller is pleasant and responsive to any problems/issues.","We received this faucet from Plumber Surplus, and although it does not have the hot/cold writing on the handles, it is a very nice looking quality faucet. After a problem whereby we received two left handed handle stems, Plumber Surplus handled our request efficiently and an entire new faucet set is in the mail."
5,Longman Crossword Key - invaluable,"This is an excellent book for assisting in solving all types of crosswords. It is a must have. I have an old, rather sad looking copy of this (due to lots & lots of use!). I am looking for a hardcopy which I am hoping will last better (or a better condition soft copy).I do not know why they have discontinued this publication - I am sure it is/was well used."
4,"A little cleaner, but still raw and ROCKING!","The first Shanks release I got my paws on, a couple of years ago. Great, great garage-influenced UK pub/punk rock. More produced and ""mature"" than their first record, but not TOO much. Too bad there are no audio samples here... They are part of the whole Medway/Billy Childish scene, if that helps. If you like your rock punky, passionate and clever, with a slightly dirty sound, give it a shot. It didn't leave my CD player for over a week! A snotty good time.There is a hilarious bit on their website where they explain some of more obscure UK references to us Yanks, plus photos, a funny band history, etc. Guess I can't list the address here, but just Google the band and you'll find it. If you like the website, you'll probably like the music!"
4,A little rembered episode on LA History,This incident in LA changed how the law is administered for all of us. It is a landmark legal case for white/Hispanic relations.By the way the lady lawyer in the case lived to her 90s and only recently passed away.
1,In Unity,"I have Tim Wheater's ""Incantation"" album, which is what prompted me to purchase another of his albums and I was VERY dissappointed in this album. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not even close,"A good recollection of a mediocre game. To label it as the ""Best Ever"" is ludicrous. Super Bowl XXXII ranks somewhere in the 11th to 15th best. Just because elway FINALLY won does not make this the ""best ever""."
5,one of the greatest lost singles of all time,"Not included on Arnold's awesome Hillside Album, this fell-between-the-cracks single from 1997 is a mighty white noise slice of self-loathing. A one-sided conversation between a dysfunctional booze-hound loser and the girl he's dragging down with him, it's unbearably sad and hugely fun at the same time. ""I'm not what they wanted for their daughter/I won't provide them with their first grand-daughter/I won't sleep with you/You don't want me to.""Then, three minutes in, all the pathos gets too much. Arnold cut the snare and thrashy drone and relax the bones of the song until it morphs into a gentle, almost pastoral lament. A stunning match of form and content. Not many bands can do that.Flanked by the Hillside title track (a #1 record in a fairer world) and Holly Lodge, another mordant outtake from that album's sessions, this is a piece of music you need to own.In ten years' time you'll be claiming you bought it back in 1997."
4,I did not have the same problem,"I did not have the same problem as the other reviewer. The item information clearly says ""2 Volume Set"" on this page, and when it arrived today, it came as two shrink-wrapped volumes.The entries are lucid and authoritative, written by some of the best scholars in Taoist studies today, but I find that occasionally the contributors are unaware of developments outside their field. The entry on Guangcheng zi, for example, should have discussed the Warring-States manuscript ""Rongcheng zi"" (now housed in the Shanghai Museum) and its possible relevance."
1,Amazon stupidly thinks that selling only volume one is good enough.,"BEWARE GETTING RIPPED OFF when you buy this title. I had to go thru enormous hassle and return this book. Amazon advertises it misleadingly. The book title on the webpage has no words about ""vol. 1"" or ""2 vols."" The picture supplied by a customer (it seems) shows a ""Vol. One"" but hell, that is just a picture of one of the books. It doesn't mean ""You ain't gonna get volume two."" For the approx. $250 price, one should be supplied BOTH VOLS., not just vol. 1, which I rec'd and which has only 700 pp. The publisher lists the exact same title, but declares it as a 2-vol. set. Amazon later told me that they do not carry a vol. 2. Without vol. 2, the title is worthless. Better to buy it for $300 from the publisher."
2,good holder if you don't need to retract the chalk....,"The previous chalk holder I bought, which was one of those spring click mechanisms, didn't hold chalk very firmly. Often I would find the chalk slowly slipping back inside the holder as I write.On the contrary, this one holds chalk way too firmly. In order to get any chalk out, I have to unscrew the tip and then poke the back end with something thin to get chalk out. Just unscrewing it and shaking the thing doesn't cause chalk to come out. This happens with the chalk included in the holder, so I'm not using incompatible chalk or anything.Unfortunately the back hole is too small for a standard pencil or anything, so I don't really see this being practical if one's intention is to carry the chalk holder around (as the pocket clip suggests) and thus needs to retract the chalk."
5,Wonderful Product,"Of the three chalk holders I purchased, this is by far the best. The others were either too thick (plastic) or the chalk would slide in when writing on the board. This one holds the chalk well - the clip prevents it from rolling on desk - nice touch. The free, clear case is wonderful - keeps my bag clean. Yes, you have to unscrew the bottom when sliding out more chalk but that takes less than 2 seconds. I do it while talking to the class. I will be purchasing a couple more; One to have ""ready to go"" in case I don't want to stop for a few seconds. The other will be for colored chalk. Great product."
3,good idea but not worth it in the end,I hate getting chalk everywhere (it always seems to end up on my black pants) so I thought this would be a good idea. In the end it sits in the chalk dust under the black board and gets covered any way. On the bright side my students love using it.
1,Nice design but not so nice purpose.,I bought this with the hopes of rarely having to touch chalk and I was super disappointed. It's difficult to insert the chalk and it's even more troublesome to slip the chalk out whether to use it when you run low or to replace.
2,possibly better in your hands...,"Could not easily advance the chalk as it was worn down while writing, essentially the primary deal breaker. If you do a lot of continuous writing (teaching), this is not for you."
5,Great chalk holder,"The chalk holder came shortly after I placed my order. I used it the second day and loved it. It holds chalks real tight. It doesn't hold thick chalks, though."
1,Did nothing for my joint pain.,I was recommend this for my ankle joint pain. I used whole bottle and saw no noticeable effect.
1,not definitive enough,"Read an article about this herbal helping with pain so ordered it. To my dismay, the bottle is labelled not advised if you have gallstones, which is not in the info above. My dr said it is too risky so I wasted my money!"
2,My Ears Are Bent -- A Little,"I enjoyed this collection of Mitchell articles, but it is really something that I think is for his hardcore fans. Readers will notice that some of the material -- in some cases, almost word for word -- became more polished articles later that appeared in his better known ""Up in the Old Hotel"" collection, and others in ""Bent"" simply aren't as lyrical, as you would expect since he was writing for newspapers and not, as later, The New Yorker."
2,Rather boring,"Stories are well crafted, but the subject matter didn't interest me. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,work's,"this item works like it is supposed too, I am pleased to say this because it says on the item that it was MADE it the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , not in CHINAa good unit. I give it 4.5 stars and have told others about it ."
5,Super smooth cutter,I am using this with a reciprocating handpiece that is a tad underpowered and this bit makes it cut quilted maple like butter. Flexcut bits strongly recommended in general.
3,An amazing journey into the jungle music.,This is a very important discovery in the jungle music. Asian Dub Foundation can make you feel the real sound of drum and bass in a very special way. I think this album can open your mind to the ADF's world. You should live the emotions with the people of the Astoria in London (where the live themes were recorded). Don't forget this title.
2,save your money,"and simply hire a good wedding photographer whose portfolio (or part of it) you have seen online or in person. Have a sit down with your photographer with a list of times and types of shots you want based on the wedding photos you have seen of others (example see the Knot wedding site). Really, this book was unnecessary."
4,"Great shoe, needs a little more support.","The shoes are excellent. The soles need more padding because they are lacking that little extra support you will need. They look great, but need a little more support. The Italians make great shoes, but they are more for style than comfort."
5,""" Rare Treasure ""","If I had't taken my vacation in Seattle,WA in '85,I would never have known about this album until now. I grabbed this at a record store there and couldn't wait to get home to hear it. It was worth the wait! Every song on the album is great in my opinion and I took giddy pride in the fact that I was the only one in town ( as far as I knew ) that owned it(to this day, I have never seen or heard it anywhere else). There is an excellent variety of song styles on this album and the arrangements are superb. My two favorite cuts are ""You can't stop the rain"" and the title track. They both have that melancholy ""rainy day"" feel to them that I love. Overall, I love this album for all the aforementioned reasons. It is to my pleasant surprise to see that it is available now on C.D."
5,The second coming,"This is the second Album of the London based Soul Group. This Album is more refined than the debut with the introduction of Nick Martinelli as producer. The group has an varied mix of Jazz and soul tracks. ""You can't stop the rain"" is by far one of the best soul tracks of the 80's and ""Hanging on a string"" is another flagship track. Listen to the Funk of ""Golden years"" and recline to ""Silent talking"". This album shoul be purchased if you want to play real classic UK soul."
3,Unlistenable in places ...,"Following their superb album ""La Revancha del Tango,"" I purchased this CD without listening to it. This one is a disappointment in several places, not the least of which is the ridiculous rap remix, ""M.A.T.H."" by Al-Shid (the quality of that one rhymes with his name). Why would these excellent musicians presume that someone who likes their tango remixes would necessarily like to listen to a rap remix? In any case, whereas the remainder of the CD is certainly not up to the quality of ""La Revancha del Tango,"" it does shine in places, especially their take on Chet Baker and ""Triptico."" Even their (yet another) re-remix of ""Santa Maria"" (see also ""Santa Maria 1"") is an excellent addition to this collection. Nonetheless, if you're a fan of Gotan Project because of ""La Revancha del Tango,"" take a pass on this one and have a listen instead to their much better follow up, ""Lunático."""
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this CD because of La Revancha Del Tango and was disappointed. While I appreciate their desire to not make all their CD's sound the same, most of it was too different for my liking. I have never liked music that begins with talking and interviews, it sounds like someone held a tape player to the radio and walked away. I will give them one more chance though."
2,Too much of a (re)mixture,"I like the first three songs (Cité Tango, Round About Midnight, Confianzas -- La Cumparsita is too short to really be considered a song). But then the CD starts to lose focus. The Man takes too long to really get going; Percussion is just a bore; and then you find that there are remixes of La Del Ruso, El Capitalismo Foréno, Tríptico and Santa Maria from La Revancha del Tango, not as good as the originals IMO -- simply annoying. If GoTan want to do remixes, fine, but put them on a CD of remixes, not one that customers think is new material. Tres Y Dos isn't GoTan style material at all; M.A.T.H even less so: English (and rap, at that) on a GoTan CD!!! Puh-leese! As well as this CD, I have La Revancha del Tango, Lunático, and Tango 3.0, and I love them (even Tango 3.0, which many fans seem to be disappointed in also) -- but I can't enjoy most of this CD."
5,A well-rounded look at African Americans,"If anyone ever doubted that African Americans live diverse lives this book will prove otherwise. In his travels, Mr. Keenan interviewed blacks from various backgrounds. It was definitely an eye opener for myself at the great diversity. The region of birth and circumstances of environment determine how these blacks viewed themselves and their place in society. I found the chaper on blacks in Vermont and Louisiana as two examples of what the world does not see as exposed by the media. Yes, there were a few mistakes, but the people who nitpicked at this let these mistakes overshadow the purpose and revelations of this find memoir. This is a book that should be kept in all Americans libraries and in particulary African Americans. I commend the author on all the hard work and time he put into it."
5,"""IIt isn't Black history, its American history,""","AS pbs PUT IT DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH. RANDALL KENAN'S WRITING IS INTELLIGENT, ARTICULATE, POETIC, RYTHMIC, HUMOUROUS AND DOWN RIGHT FASCINATING! A SEARCH FOR THE MEANING OF 'BLACK,' EXPECTED TO END IN ONE OR TWO YEARS, TOOK AN ENTIRE SEVEN YEAR CYCLE OF RANDALL KENAN'S LIFE. WHAT A MARVELOUS JOURNEY IT IS. THE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE HE INTERVIEWED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES ARE RIVETING AND ENHANCE OUR LIVES AND EDUCATE US RICHLY. I DID NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN, SAVORING EVERY PAGE. I AM HONORED AND MOVED TO SHARE HIS EXPERIENCE. NOW I WANT TO READ EVERYTHING ELSE RANDALL KENAN HAS WRITTEN."
4,Expect it will be fine,"Haven't finished reading yet but am enjoying it. I saw Kenan interviewed and was very impressed. He's done his homework, knows his terrain."
4,"Johnny Pacheco, Jose Fajardo and Pupi Legarretta came together in 1980 to create this very nice Charanga album.","This 1980 release was a significant one because Pacheco abandoned the Conjunto/Tipico sound which had been the hallmark of his recordings with Celia Cruz, Pete ""Conde"" Rodriguez"" and Hector Casanova and went back to the Charanga style that had characterized his 1960s recordings for Alegre Records. Of course, the contributions from the equally great Jose Fajardo and Pupi Legarretta can't be ignored and add plenty of sabor (flavor) to this classic Cuban Charanga-influenced album. Both ""Presente Y Pasado"" and ""Me Voy Pa' Moron"" are the album's masterpieces but the others are by no means bad. Hopefully, this album will someday be reissued and remastered by Codigo Music Group (Fania's current owners)."
1,The Worst Phone I Ever Had,"I've been through quite a few phones in the past couple years (Nokia, LG, Motorola, and now this Samsung) and I have got to say that this is by far the worst of the bunch. This phone fails at almost everything that makes a cellphone good. The reception is terrible (A two minute conversation takes 10 minutes because you and the person on the other end always need to repeat yourselves), It does not keep your contacts organized very well (multiple entries for the same person if they have more than one number...), a ludicrous ""Push to talk"" feature that is entirely worthless...even the alarm clock is needlessly complicated.If you are shopping for a cell phone, DO NOT GET SUCKERED INTO BUYING THIS MODEL. You will be disappointed, I promise you.I decided to write this review after being swindled into getting this phone for my 2 year contract upgrade. This is a downgrade and a half, that's for sure."
5,Great for homemade Vanilla,"This item is PERFECT for making many things, not to mention reasonably priced. I love making my own vanilla and kahlua to give as presents...and, of course, to use myself:) These beans appear fresh and ideal for what I need. Can't do without them!"
3,Silverware Chest,"This chest is attractive and relatively inexpensive compared to others I found. It's a bit small to handle a setting of 12, plus no room for extra serving pieces. I bought it for a set of silver I was giving to my daughter. If I could have seen/compared others I likely would have selected one that was a bit larger. However for the price, this chest is a good by."
5,Great customer service,"I had to return a different style platter and in exchange I got this one. You should know that the products from this company are very rustic and you can tell they are handmade, so if you are looking for something without imperfections, then head to the chain store. I love is that each piece is not only beautiful but unique. What I really have to say is how amazing the customer service Alexandra at Le Souk provided me. The process was simple and resolved in a way that exceeded my expectations. Many companies these days don't place much value in making their customers happy, Le Souk made sure that my satisfaction was a priority, and because of that I will continue to be a loyal customer."
1,To Weave a Web of Magic,"This was one of the worst books I've read! The stories were all slow and boring and pointless. I love most anything Lynn Kurland has written, her story was tolerable, but that's the best I can say. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,Hmmm,"The stories were good, but they left me going ""What, wait it can't be over"" and not in a good way they just seemed unfinished like the authors got to the word limit and stopped. I'm glad I bought the book to add to my Lynn Kurland collection but was still a tad bit disappointed."
3,"Some Stories Good, Some Not","Lynn Kurland and Sharon Shinn wrote beautiful stories -- and good reading. I've read all of Kurland's other books and this one was nice, too. I've never read Shinn, but I am going to start. I love her angel world.The other stories were a disappointment. The last one had a sad ending -- nobody was happy. The romance soured and they all lived horribly ever after. Byuk! The first story was almost a romance. It was more a story of falling out of infatuation than falling in love.Read this for Kurland and Shinn, but skip the other two stories."
1,disappointed,"I found all the stories in this book to be way below each of the writer's usual standards, especially Lynn Kurland's. I have read every book she has written and really enjoyed them. Her story does not come anywhere close to any of her previous novels or short stories. It is flat and the ending doesn't conclude the story or satisfy the reader. I wish I hadn't even read it and I feel I wasted my money buying the book. The other stories were dumb."
5,A must read for anyone with a keen interest in WWII France.,"More of an encyclopedia than a dictionary, this reference guide is eminently readable.Gordon has done a first-rate job of covering just about every known and little known facet of WWII France."
3,It is an interview cd.,"It is, like most other interview cds, hard to hear unless with headphones. Its always cool to hear the band just talk so if your a die hard fan -- buy it. It has a cool picture of the band on the back of the case(Siamese dream era photo)"
2,Caution on kids' cuts- it really hurts!,"First, this is the next best product for making a nice flexible bandage layer other than the professional ones I use in the Emergency Dept (IE, Dermabond) But, unlike the others, it hurts a lot (likely due to the alcohol solvent). When I used it on my 3 year old's cut, she screamed for 15 mins after I applied it. Then, last night that I tried it on my own small superficial cut. I thoroughly agree that with her, it was incredible painful for about 15 minutes. And, given its nature, I don't think you can really wash it off once it starts hurting. Unfortunate for such a great product. Be careful, maybe it is best for cuts after 24hrs, when they have already started to seal off and then it would not hurt too much"
4,Great at what it does.,"This product is great at what it does. It creates a flexible skin over the top of a cut or scrape. I use it often for cuts on my hands that would be hard to cover with a bandage.Yes, it stings when it's applied. But life is tough, suck it up. I would recommend using two or three coats to create a good seal, wait a minute or two between coats for it to harden. Stays on when you wash your hands or take a shower."
1,Does not work for finger skin cracks!,I work with wood and mechanical stuff a lot so my hands are always getting dirty and dry. Washing them with hand cleaner makes it worse and the dryness causes cracks on my finger tips. I've tried all kinds of products and lotions and nothing really worked except an early Band-Aid product which is no longer made. I have repeatedly tried Skin Shield and it doesn't work for finger dry skin cracks. It might work for other uses but definitely not for this problem. And it stings when you apply it. And it tends to peel off like it is clear paint.If you are looking for a product to seal dry skin cracks then skip Skin Shield as it will not help.
1,Hurts like Hell!,Just bought this hoping I could use it on my grandkids. No way. This stuff stings like a bee.
4,Product Good/ Customer Service Bad,"The produce is exactly what I expected, Quality is first rate, but when it came time to contact Calphalon Customer Relations, the staff left a bit to be desired....I still havn't heard from them and it's been 10 days...very poor customer service..."
1,staining,"I purchased the 15 piece set, thought they were a good price. After using for a couple months they started staining. I had cheaper sets of knives that didn't stain at all. They do hold a nice edge, but everytime you go to use them you have to clean real well so the people you have over don't think your giving them dirty knives. Upon contacting the company they say it is normal for them to stain and you have to dry them right away, removing any water on them. seems like good knives shouldn't stain at all . I will probally throw them out and purchase another set from another company. The price may be right but the aggravation isn't worth it."
4,Great variety and quality of knives for the money....,"I have this set for about a month now and I am very happy with it. The set contains a good variety of knives that are well made and seem to hold their edge. I understand that they need a bit more care because of the type of steel used, but I prefer the extra care over using a poor quality knife. I wash and dry them individually and I haven't noticed any staining.I think for the money the block could be made bigger to hold all the knives. I also think the steak knives are not quite as sturdy as the other knives in the set. However, these are the only shortcomings I've noticed. I also like that the set includes a bread knife. I find this very useful and a lot of inexpensive sets leave one out.This is a good value for the price. I also like the labelled handles, it's a very nice touch."
4,great set of knives,"I've never had a ""nice"" set of knives before. These are great! They have a nice feel in my hands. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart. The scissors I bought at Smart & Final come apart for easy washing and drying."
4,What a cutie!,"Totoro: 12"" Smiling Dark Gray TotoroI wish he was just a little softer (as in squishy) but other than that, he's a cutie with nice, soft fur and an adorable shape."
1,Horrible! Steer clear!!,"I have about 5 friends who have this stroller and love it. I recently got one and absolutely hate it. It's impossible to push and turn. Too bad because it's lightweight and easy to fold, but what's the point when you can't push it? I called the company and they were not helpful or kind. I thought I must have a defective stroller. All they could offer was for us to try a silicon lubricant on the wheels. They should replace the stroller. I will never buy another product from this company again. Clearly you are paying for the name, not quality. Save your money and DO NOT buy this stroller."
2,Very overpriced for what you get,"I bought this stroller for when we had our second child. My children are 19 mo. apart. I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it. This one is definitely not the same. For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps. The wheels are always getting stuck. Second, it is hard to close. The most frustrating part is the steering issue. Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago. I've only had the stroller for nine months. One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun."
1,works only for light weights,"I bought this double stroller a few years ago when I had my second child. I used it a few times at the beginning, and it was very irritating the way the wheels dug in so I could not maneuver the stroller at all. TERRIBLE for shopping or anywhere you will be stop and go, also TERRIBLE if you will be going over any cracks or bumps at all on the road. So basically terrible. It's actually easier to chase my kids around than to try to use the stroller.As my child grew bigger the problem got worse and it is totally unusable.it can't handle weight beyond newborns? Come on, Peg Perego.Now I'm about to have my third child. I was expecting this stroller to last. knowing how terrible it is I can not in good conscience sell this stroller to make money and buy a new one. I am in an extremely tight financial situation and I can not buy another double stroller, even a cheaper one used.Thanks a lot, Peg Perego."
1,THE WORST STROLLER!!! Pretty but Useless,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Do not buy this!!!! I hope you listen because you will be very very very sorry. I was attracted to it because it is sleek and cooler looking that the bulky frumpy Gracos, but once it arrived I was sorry I bought it. The cupholder broke the first week and is long gone. The fold up and stand option never works. It falls over everytime. However, the worst and most annoying part about this thing is that the stroller has absolutely NO manuverability. The wheels constantly get stuck. The plastic is so flimpsy and they used such cheapo materials. Peg Perego should be ashamed they are charging so much for such a junky stroller. I am tossing it and buying a different one."
2,Save your money - buy the Maclaren!!,"If you are looking for a side by side double stroller I recommend the Maclaren over the Aria. I am not happy with my stroller at all. Although it is much lighter than the Maclaren, the product is not as durable. I have a 2 yr old and a 4 month old, and the stroller clearly pulls to the heaver side. What I am really dissapointed about is that Peg Perago does not stand behind their product. 2 months into using my stroller the clip that holds the seat broke. I was unable to recline or secure one side of the stroller. (The Aria decale on the side of the stroller also came apart). I called customer service for a new clip and was charged $7.95 for ""shipping and handling"". I have friends who have the Maclaren stroller, and it is very durable. If something does go wrong with the product they ship you the pieces free of charge!!"
1,Misleading,"I bought this particular stroller because of it's name (thinking quality), because it is so light weight, and lastly because of the snack trays(it's hard to find a light-weight double with snack trays). However, it is so not worth it. It digs in whenever I am pushing it due to the weight??? or poor design, but it also slides around and kills my back because I can't get the wheels to go where I am headed as they are constantly spinning. The snack tray is a joke because you can't even fit a cup in in. The shades about don't cover anything and the kids are constantly in the sun. On the plus side, the bottom has room for my purse and it's only 14 lbs so it is easy and small to get in and out of my Toyota Corolla."
1,Don't purchase this stroller!,"This stroller is very poorly designed and constructed. The small wheels make it very difficult to maneuver, the seats are hard to adjust, and the carrier drags on the ground. It also started to fall apart soon after we purchased it. The cupholder broke immediately even though it had never been used, the carrier fabric tore with very little stress, and numerous screws and tabs fell out. Not only do these missing parts make the stroller nearly impossible to open and close, they create safety issues as well. All of this happened with light to normal use. I paid $330 for this stroller, and a year later, it's nearly unusable. (By contrast, my Graco single stroller, which is much older and more heavily used, is in perfect condition.) Peg Perego customer service is absolutely terrible -- worse than any I've experienced. I'd never purchase a Peg Perego product again."
1,Horrible Stroller,"We bought the Aria Twin Stroller because it seemed the best that was out there and the Peg Perego name. What a waste of time this thing was. We took it back to the store after about 30 days because the wheels were sticking and making it difficult to steer. We stupidly took a replacement Aria and after only 2 more weeks took that one back for the same problem. We have an 18 month and a 7 month old, so we needed a stroller that was manueverable and reliable.We ended up getting a BOB double stroller with a swivel front wheel. If you have a chance to read up and research BOB it's well worth it. What a great buy that was. We were lucky though, we got our money back for the Aria stoller. We should have just spend a few more bucks and got the BOB to begin with."
2,Don't waste your money,"Alert - Don't waste your money. This stroller is terrible. It is very hard to use and the wheels are a nightmare. The only good thing I can say is that it folds up nicely and is fairly light weight, but the less expensive competition has started to buy into this trend. I have found Gracco to be the way to go."
4,Mom of 3 - loves this stroller,I went through 2 HEAVY double strollers with my 1st 2 kids age 3 and 5 now. I purchased the Aria 4 months ago when my son (3rd kid) was 4 months old. I LOVE it! It is so lightweight and it can hold either the 3 or 5 year old alongside the baby. This stroller works for us because we are in and out of the car all day long and it is quick to collapse and doesn't weigh a ton.
3,Disappointed,"I thought Peg Pegero was suppose to make strollers that were really good. So I decided to purchase the Aria. I wish I hadn't. It is light and folds easily. However, my wheels get stuck so it's hard to get going. Next, the cup holder didn't even clip on! Never mind being to small. The stickers fell off the stroller. I really am disappointed with the quality. Like many other moms I have the graco stroller which I didn't like because my kids would kick each other's chair."
3,"One Step Foreward, Two Steps Back","This thin book has only bare bones information that is now mostly out of date. The photographs have all appeared in several other TFH published books about guinea pigs over the years. For example, photos of red cedar being used as bedding AND cages with wire mesh bottoms are included. It is now known that red cedar is one of the worst bedding materials for guinea pigs, and that wire mesh bottomed cages can often cripple or kill guinea pigs. The best thing going for this book is the CARTOONS! Yes, guinea pigs may seem cartoonish enough, but these dozen or so cartoons will definately make you look at your piggy differently! If you're looking for guinea pig caretaking information, don't look in here. If you collect guinea pig books and want to see something a little different with the cartoons, then step over to it."
5,Terror in the Staduim,"This book isn't one of the best of the Left Behind for Kids, but it is still pretty good. Judd and Lionel convince Mr.Stien to take them to Israel for the meeting of the witnesses. While Judd,Lionel, and Mr.Stien fly to Israel, Vicki is trying to turn the old schoolhouse into a place where nonbelievers can learn about Jesus. When Judd,Loinel, and Mr.Stien finnaly reach Israel it is hard to find a place to stay. They find one and stay there till the witness meeting starts. Carpathia says no witness will be hurt, during the meetings, but will he keep his promise? like I said, this book is good, but it is not the best in the series."
4,Terror in the Stadium,"This book isn't one of the best of the Left Behind for Kids series, but it is still a pretty good book. Judd and Lionel convience Mr. Stien to take them to the meeting of the witnesses in Israel. While Judd, Lionel, and Mr.Stien fly to Israel, Vicki is trying to turn the old schoolhouse into a place where nonbelievers can learn about Jesus.

Carpathia says no one will be hurt during the meetings, but will he keep his promise? Like I said, this book is good, but it is not the best in the series of Left Behind for Kids books"
2,A nice clock but...,"The temperature from the outdoor sensor is as much as 12 degrees warmer than a mercury thermometer in the same place when the temperature is below about 10 degrees F. I believe the advertised lower temperature limit is something like -4 degrees F, which is not very useful in much of the Northern US during the winter. The scale does appear to go a bit lower but the accuracy is very questionable. Several nights this winter (in central vermont) have caused the device to go off scale which then appears to set the minimum temperature to LL-L. The humidity sensor also seems to have a lower limit of 20% and it is unclear what the accuracy is near that limit.The external sensor does not have a button to turn of the display and conserve batteries nor does it have humidity sensor, which would be useful.The clock seems to work well."
4,Abundantly Adequate,I found the Weather station very satisfactory and a good value for the price. I would have prefered a different location for the reset buttons. I have to remove the unit from it's hangar on the wall to reset the maximum and minimum temp's. All of the other features are top notch.
3,Tighten Up Vol. 1 (Remixes),"I like ""Hangin on a String"" as it's the original version. The rest of the disc I rate as ""passable."" Three stars..."
3,Maybe I was expecting too much...,"This CD is just OK. Maybe I was expecting too much. The 'Slow Down' remix is cool. Nothing else really jumps out at you. It's like if this was playing in the background while you were shopping, you might not notice."
2,not that great....,"what started as an interesting premise was lost by the manner in which the author wrote the hero's dialogue. She used the excuse early in the book that he's Italian and doesn't say ""thee's, thou's, etc"" but learns them to marry Elizabeth-but it's WAY overdone! What should have been funny quickly became annoying. To the point that I didn't finish the book cause it was headache inducing:(2 stars for an interesting premise-try it you may have better luck than me:("
3,Arrived quickly. I did not continue to take though.,"The product arrived quickly, but I did not take it consistently. Sorry, I do not know if it works as intended."
5,best ever,"Nice and long, so it's comfortable to write with. Adjusts pretty well, so most chalk sizes will fit well, even the thinner chalks that my old holder could not grip onto. Overall, a great chalkholder"
4,chalk holder,"I gave this product to my instructor as a gift and he loved it, however he could not figure out how to move the chalk up."
1,Wrong Translation.,The kindle edition is NOT the N.J. Dawood translation that is found in the Penguin paperback edition. Saying that a completely different translation is the same book is very misleading.
1,Hard to Follow,Good concept. but very hard to follow. I wanted to read the Koran. not have someone elses interpretation of it in with the verses.
1,koran,"It does not tell you how you should live your life, It does mention Jesus but not in the way our bible does,"
1,Not in proper order,"The suras (chapters) are not in normal order. This makes it difficult to find anything. And Kindle does not properly search in the titles. For instance type Sura lviii, you will get content inside chapters and notes but not the title."
4,nice,"i always wanted to read the koran for study purposes. koran's are not as easy to get than bibles, so this book is very good to have."
1,Out of order,The order of the chapters makes no sense...Sura 1 is burried in the middle...everything is upside-down and backwards. I wish I had bought a different version.
5,rotten,"""rotten"", Ross Thomas' characters would say. It's more rotten than the other 10 novels I've read so far."
4,It is a good book.,"As a non-native English speaker, I need a dictionary in my office. It is an easy book to read."
2,MegaFox: 1002 Things You Wanted to Know about Extending Visual Foxpro,"This book will not be of help to the novice.What is 1002 things? I expect that there will be '1002-things' bytopic in this book, but that's very obscure.The topic explained in this book seems not essentil for those programmedin Visual Foxpro, but it's better have one than not in lack of books concerning about VFP."
5,Better than an iPod,"I bought this for my son so i guess I'll let him write the review from here on in. Hell yeah this is better than an over hyped mp3 player(iPod). I've had it for about a day now and to be honest the only complain that I can make is that Archos is cheap. This product deserves the 5 stars it's just that you have to buy simple little things that should've came in the box. My brother's mp3 player came with a/v plug that could connect with the tv to record or play on-screen. Archos wants you to fork up $99.99 for the DVR station, when I buy mines i'm getting it from Walmart for less than $74.00. The camera and camcorder is great and the built-in speaker is superb. The clarity and crispness of the 3.5"" screen is eye-orgasmic when watching pictures or videos. Pros: It's a damn good mp3 player/camera/camcorder Cons: Archos wants you to pay for certain things that should be included in the box"
4,Best bang for your buck,"This little bugger is great. While, like some of the other reviewers, I was torn at first with some of the bugs, I quickly downloaded the firmware updates from the Archos website. It fixed every problem I had and I just love the way this thing does it all pretty well. It's no camera or camcorder replacement, but the picture quality is better than most any cell phone camera.The controls and UI are easy to understand and figure out with only minor exceptions (adding songs to an existing playlist took me a bit to figure out).I downloaded the codec that allows you to play podcast and iTunes files for $20. Well worth not having to convert all my music.Only con is that it doesn't come with a charger. It charges via the USB cable rather slowly, and the docking station/charger is sold seperately.Considering what all this little thing does and its price, you can't really go wrong."
2,Archos Product and Customer Support,"The low price of this item is deceptive. Upon receipt, it will perform minimally as an MP3 player, but hardly anything else. Each added feature requires an additional purchase. One can expect to spend another $60 to $100 to bring it up to 'advertised' capability (recorder, multi-mode viewer, photo vault, etc.) .My experience with Archos customer support was disappointing. In trying to replace a part for a legacy 402 Gmini, I found the support to be unfamiliar with the products and unwilling to help. I will not purchase another Archos product. More expensive products may actually be less expensive after factoring additional purchases for increased functionality and subsequent replacement due to nonsupport."
3,I wear them for cold-weather biking,"They are like really fuzzy, soft socks for above your feet! I wear these for cold-weather cycling to keep my shins warm. They seem to do the trick when bundled with thermal pants."
2,Leg Warmers are not the same as they use to be.,Bought this product several years ago and it was great but the new ones are so much smaller they don't fit wellaround the calf and are too short barely go up to the knee and keep slipping down the leg.
3,leg warmer - warm but odd odor,"leg warmer is cozy, but acrid odor around tops. washed them once,slightly lessened; hope this will go away after a couple of more washes."
4,Good winter layer,"I was late to the party on leg warmers, but I have found them to be a useful layer in cold weather. If I get too warm, I can tuck them down or even remove them without disrobing completely (as in long underwear).Convenient and comfortable."
3,had potential,These could have been so awesome but they formed a hole at the top on the very first day. The hole got bigger after every wash but it seems to be in stable condition now.They were/are comfortable and stayed in place. No weird tags or material inside to itch or scratch and they are comfortable enough that I forget I'm wearing them.
1,Extremely Poor Quality,These are awful quality. The began to come apart after only twouses. The threads are already coming apart drastically. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,Not so great,These are made for thin legs or children. My legs are average size and these aren't really working for me.
5,Perfect!,"I was searching Amazon for foot heaters that I could use under my desk, while working on my computer at home. My whole house can be toasty, but my feet would be like ice, given the expanse of hardwood floors. Then I remembered about leg warmers and switched direction completely. After searching and reading reviews, I settled on these.And they are great! Warm and fuzzy and cosy. And they get the job done. If I pull them down, over my toes, I get completely toasty in just a few minutes. They are also stretchy enough that I can pull them up over shoes that I am wearing as well.They did leave some little black lint around the house, but this stopped after the first day or so.Complete and unashamed two-thumbs-up!"
5,Warmth,"I have an office in my basement which obviously has cement walls. I did have a heater installed, but my calves would be cold all day. I finally got sick of rubbing them and had to think of something that would work to keep them warm in lieu of a space heater under my desk.I honestly do not know what made me think of these ""Leg Warmers"", but I took the time to research Amazon 1st then ordered two pair for a trial.Needless to say I am kicking myself for not resolving this dilemma sooner. They absolutely serve the purpose."
2,Nice but smells funny,"These fit well and are nice and fuzzy, but they have a very distinct odor that is rather unpleasant. I have washed them once and am trying it again to see if I can get rid of the smell. If it helps I'll keep them, otherwise away they go!"
4,Great leg warmers!,"When I decided to wear leg warmers, I had no idea which type would be the best. I now have 5 different materials and brands, and the biggest complaint for most of them is that they don't stay up very well. I loved the first pair of these leg warmers so much that I purchased a second pair, and will probably order more -- they're warm, soft and, best of all, they stay up!"
5,These things are great!,"I was initially skeptical of these because everything is itchy to me at this point. I am 8 mos pregnant and can't wear pajama pants because I am carrying so low, so my legs get really cold with just a gown and robe at night. My mom suggested I get legwarmers, but I was afraid everything would be made of the sweater knit fabric and fall down/ itch. These are wonderful, though! They are really soft, silky, and furry. They stay up really well even on my skinny legs and come up over the knee. My mom ordered them for me in black, and my daughter says it looks like I have hairy gorilla legs when I wear them, but hey, at least my legs are warm! I plan to order another pair in a different color to wear if my legs get cold when I am in the hospital having the baby so the nurses don't refer to me as the lady with the gorilla legs or something ;) Overall great product!"
1,terrible product,"the cripping tool is very low quality as is all the terminal connectors, the only thing that is good is the tape!"
3,Cheap but it works,This was a great little set. The box it came in was fine and the tools and pieces that came in the kit did the job. There is room to add items if you want and you can let someone borrow it without having to give them your good stuff. You should buy a few of these and place one in your car and one in your boat or RV.
5,RealReader,Mistress on His TermsGenerally I'd review the book...but in this case I'll like to add that this writer is one of the best HP writers--if not the best one. I've been avidly catching up on reading her books since I just recently discovered them. This book is pretty good--the other reviewers that said positive things were right! The negative reviewer I'm not sure what they read--but this book rocks! five stars.
1,Jerk of a Hero,"The H in this book was just too childish. ""On his terms"" is the key here. From the first chapter when the h steps off the plane H is condecending, rude, and obnoxious. It doesn't get any better throughout the whole relationship. He barley shows any caring when h is having a tough time coming to grips with the loss of her parents just six months before. He's accusatory, there is never any trust and while h stands up for herself at a few points it is not enough to make H really see her as a person and not just someone he can use to get his own way."
5,This is so TRUE!,"I really liked this book. It doesnt tell you anything you don't already know. In fact, it's like a slap in the face, Hey PEOPLE, spend some quality time with your children! The dishes can wait. The laundry can wait. But your children can't and time ticks on. I keep this book on my night stand to remind me and to reflect on. Get the book and spend some time with your wonderful children. Time ticks on."
2,Not pick of the litter,"Susan Conant's books are generally enjoyable, but something went wrong here. Is Holly taking herself way too seriously? Was the whole Geraldine Dodge theme a dull way to keep the plot connected? Why have Holly own a cat and continue to harp about how much she dislikes the ugly cat? (I don't even LIKE cats and this bugged me) This book should have been culled by the editors."
3,Interesting but not wonderful,"I greatly enjoy this series and understand that the 12th book in a series must break new ground but perhaps this ground was not a fertile as it should have been. It was a fun read and I laughed outloud at times but would like a trip back to the main stream. Maybe it is time for Holly to get another dog. Since I have a new chessie puppy, I promise that lots of stories will come from it."
2,Series has lost its charm for me,"I've read all of the previous Holly Winter books, and generally thought they were entertaining. I hadn't read any for a couple of years, and picked this one up on my Kindle. I'm not sure if the books have gotten more ridiculous or if I just don't get it anymore, but this was not good. I have a problem with a book when the main character just annoys me. Between Holly's utter disregard for the humans in her life and her looking at the entire world as being all about malamutes, I couldn't take it. (And I love malamutes - dogs, cats, I am an animal lover, which is why I usually enjoy animal mysteries!) The author needs to bring Holly a little closer to reality."
4,Only the people are evil,"I love this series of mysteries. Evil Breeding was especially fun with heroine delving into history of dogs shows, Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge and her influence in the world of dogs in the U.S. The authentic Boston setting is another reason I find this one of the best dog themed series. Though I wonder why the ending did not tie up the deceitful breeding practices of the villain's family. I also appreciate how she showed the research process of a freelance writer"
2,Forced myself to finish it...,"I am a loyal Conant reader. I love all of her books but this w=one took a wron gturn. What happened here Susan? I hated this one! If this was your first time reading her books and you hated it, don't give up! I suggest The Wicked Flea. That one is my fav. I've also read this, Bloodlines, Black Ribbon, and one more that I cannot remember. Don't give up on her! This is the best series ever!!!!"
4,"Please, Holly, no more horror stories about dogs!","One of the reasons I often avoid stoies about animals is bacause they die, or are tortured. If I want that kind of horror, there is plenty of it in the real world. I was given several of Susan Conant's earlier books, and found they had far too much of this type of information, meaning I stopped reading at a certain point, and passed the books on to others less squeamish. I always approached them like a hand grenade with the pin pulled, never knowing when it might explode. Her talent is terrific, her dogs wonderful, but I can't, and don't want to, become hardened enough to enjoy these books. If she were to concentrate more on Steve (or he's going to be history), and the good parts of her life, and less on historical atrocities, I would become a loyal reader."
2,A Dog Lover's Mystery? Not really.,"Love the series, but this entry is below par. I miss the usual characters, especially the dogs, which were in this book seemingly only as a token appearance to keep the ""Dog Lover's Mystery"" tag line. Disappointing."
1,Dismayed enough to write,"I loved Ms. Conant's early books in the series but lately and in particular, this book, is unbelievably bad. I could not follow the story line, the dog training or any dog topics were almost non-existent, and what type of character Holly is becoming is getting stranger and stranger. The publishers really need to give this author a good editor. This book is very bad and it is a shame that her previous success and her well-known name allows the customer to think they're getting a good read. Disgraceful."
1,For Alaskan Malamute Lovers Only,"This is the only one of the series that I've read, and now I doubt I'll bother with the others. Conant has hung a bunch of red-herring plot twists and turns on a simplistic semi-mystery that in the end is nothing more than a guilty-family-secret story. Nazis, eugenics, dog shows in the thirties, a Rockefeller heiress, the Isabelle Stewart Gardner museum -- all turn out to be irrelevant to the story line...."
1,Evil Breeding,"Never have I disliked a main character as much as the woman in this book. The character was so self-centered, rude, arrogant and obsesssive about controlling her dogs that it interfered with the marginal plot."
1,This book is no good,This book contains only one chapter that makes sense. Everything else is outdated system that was popular when charts were not available.If you want to learn more about trading read Toby Crabel's articles or some John Ross.
1,just dont work no more,"The old saying is the harder something in the market is , the more likely it dont work.This is a lot of mombo jumbo.It may have had its time but the s&p moves more know in 5 min then it did all day back then."
3,Wish I had a 50% wining record!,"50% accuracy is not as bad as the former reviewer suggest, provided you win 3 times the amount you loose. even a 2 to 1 winning record would make a 0,5 dollar net profit on every dollar risked in the long run.So if you combine this technique with a good money management system such as optimal f ( The Mathematics of Money Managment by Ralph Vince) it could make you a billionaire.So the question is: how much expectancy does this system produce?,The answer is not so straightforward. Backtesting and stop loss optimizing might be necessary to answer this.Francisco"
3,Got this book for my 16 year old Son who is very artistic.,My son is in the art academy at his high school yet I need his math skills to improve. great for artist. like him.
1,"Sigh, yet another book that doesn't give the proper origin or credit.","All of these books that keep popping up saying you can do the math in your mind in seconds, are correct in one way. Yes, you can do it...in fact you can do pretty massive equations using #'s in the millions or below, (or higher). The thing that is terrible about all of these books is they sound like a modern day memory book or such. They are ALL based upon what is called Vedic math. It was the math form used thousands of years ago...generally dating around the Summerian culture.Vedic math really does work...in fact it's quite mind-blowing to put out answers to a large group of #'s just as someone finishes reading the problem! : ) Check out websites based upon Vedic math, or buy books directly relating to Vedic math...there's more to it than just putting it in print."
5,Regarding 13*54,"First, a great book. I'm enjoying putting some of these methods to use!Second, in response to Nehal from 4/7/05:""But what happens when we want to multiply 13 x 54? In this case, we would like to start out with 10 (for 13) and 50 (for 54) giving us 10 x 50 = 500. In other words, we use 2 Reference Numbers: 10 and 50. Next, we make the corrections from here.""13*54Use 10 as the reference number for both. Mentally write+3 +44over the 13 and 54 respectively.Gives54 + 3 = 57, and 57 * 10 = 570so 570 +44 * 3 = 120 + 12 = 132so the answer to 13*54 = 570 + 100 + 32 = 670 + 30 + 2 = 702Sure, problems in general get more difficult as you stray from the reference number, that's a given, but it is no big deal."
5,GPX Digital MP3 Player,MP3 player works great! It even shuffles. It also has room for expansion with an SD card.
3,Good for advanced beginner or journeyman level,"If you are an advanced PB programmer you will not find much here unless you have been stuck in versions 6.5 (or maybe even 7 but less so) and earlier. The authors give a reasonable overview of the new IDE and source control integration. There is also discussion of the newer features such as Powerbuilder Native Interface, XML datawindows, command line deployment, and error handling. Over 200 pages are devoted to database connectivity which may be of interest if you support multiple platforms.Aside from some minor factual errors and the occasional typo, the information and examples are concise and to the point (although many leave out even rudimentary error checking which is vital in any 'real' application).I bought the book since there haven't been any 'real' PB books since version 7 and this one details the new IDE."
4,Brilliant,"Bill Plympton does it again. Bringing us a unique, funny and interesting, dark film that will keep you entertained the entire time. The lack of dialogue makes it even more enjoyable, seeing how he makes up for it with the story and sound effects, along with music and his unique style of drawing. He has a very strange, warped imagination that has never failed to amuse me! If you liked this, I highly recommend watching his movie ""I Married a Strange Person"" and vice versa. That is my favorite Plympton film and by my opinion, even much better than this one."
2,ehhh,This really wasn't that great. The humor is not... well its not funny and that's kind of disappointing. Don't buy this.
4,ORANGE LIGHTSABERS ARE IN THE MOVIES,"In episode 2 after mace windu (samuel jackson) says this party's over, and Dooku (Christopher Lee) is focoused on a green lightsaber twirls behind, and for a second you can clearly see an orange lightsaber!"
2,Numerical Analysis for Dummies its not...,"This book covers all the topics a reader would expect of numerical analysis and comes with a CD of pre-built code for many of the analysis techniques. From my perspective, the authors' present theorem and proof with relatively few examples. I found myself referring to Gerald and Wheatley's Applied Numerical Analysis (among others) for the duration of my college course to attain the level of understanding expected by the university. Gotta love libraries! At $.., this is the most expensive math book I've purchased, and I can say that I wouldn't value it at this price if it had not been selected by the university. Best of luck to those who read it..."
2,VERY DRY,"I normally do not review books, but I feel so strongly negative towards this one.The book is very dry - there is an example at the beginning of each chapter to serve as a motivation, but other than that, the examples are very plain. In addition, he does not give enough material to work all of the problems. The examples are very basic and full of horrid notation. There are a lot of holes in the logic as well.A plus side is that the algorithms are not difficult to implement with only a few notational quirks to deal with (but none of them have detailed explanations).From a student's perspective, you should steer clear away from this one."
2,If you are a beginner at numerical analysis do not buy this book,"There is not much to say about this book except that it is often extremely confusing for the layman. The examples skip steps, there is usually no explanation as to how to apply the theorems and one is often completely clueless as to how to do the exercises, or much guesswork must be done on how to apply the given formulas.If you are already knowledgeable on the subject of numerical analysis this book might be a good reference for refreshing your memory but for the beginner it is for the most part going to be a frustrating waste of time."
2,Get another book!,"I took a numerical analysis course last semester at my university and had a horrible time understanding this book. As many reviewers have already stated, there aren't very many examples and the explanations aren't very clear. I had to refer to a number of other books from the school library to actually figure anything out. Don't waste your money on this book, there are much better books on the subject out there."
2,Confusing,"This is an expensive math textbook which is confusing and has errors here and there. The answers to some of the exercises are incorrect. The algorithms provided in the text are very hard to understand and the code from the attached CD did not really match the algorithms in the book. If you're looking for a straightforward numerical analysis textbook, don't waste your money on this book like I did."
2,Not for beginners,Examples are few and offer little explaination.I find this book so hard to follow.On a good note: algorithms are clear.
2,Poorly written,"This book has been, unfortunately, my first introduction to numerical analysis. I wish that I could have chosen a superior book myself, but this is the one prescribed by the university I attend.The examples in this book are mostly short and insufficient, especially when they are most needed. The lack of good examples wouldn't be so much of a problem, however, if the text itself were better. Unfortunately, many topics are poorly explained. The notation used in this book is often awkward and confusing.I'm used reading math textbooks and understanding them. Unfortunately, Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires expects the reader to understand concepts that aren't even fully explained in the text. Avoid if you can."
2,Numerical Analysis,"I bought this book for my Numerical Analysis class. It proves theorems very un-rigorously. I've only seen the first 3 chapters so far, but a frequent phrase that comes up is ""and by the results that we will show in Chapter 6, (statement) is true""."
4,Good introductory text,"This text is very good for introducing the reader to many different concepts in numerical analysis. The book is definitely written from a mathemetician's point of view. If you just need algorithms and aren't looking for the math behind them... I wouldn't reccomend this book, but if you are looking to understand what makes an algorithm work and the tools to know why one algorithm will perform better for your problem than another, I heartily reccomend this book as a good text to start from. One of the best tools included in this book is a large and complete Bibliography which will lead readers yearning for more information on a given topic to good sources. Enjoy"
2,get a second book for class,"If you are reading this book one of two things is going on, either you are teaching a class or taking a class. If you are taking the class I suggest you buy another book to learn from in addition to this book.The book gets two stars only because of the algorithms. The algorithms are clearly stated and can be transcribed into the language of your choice fairly easily. However if you want to understand what the algorighms do this is a lousy book. I'm not familiar with the others, I've heard they are not any good either. I guess my advise to you is to get a good teacher."
2,Mediocre,"I am a Math/CS major in my senior year and I am learning Numerical Methods in spite of this book it sometime seems. It has all the necessary information, but the examples are all given through algebra (never a good proof machine except when you are in need of being pedantic) rather than through logical arguments. It seems to provide only information and not intuition. I don't know what other books are available, but you might want to check them out first."
5,I had to return and full refund with no problems!!!,I ordered the wrong edition and I wanted to return the book. I just wrote return to the expeditor on the original package and I got a full refund with no problems at all. Very satisfied!!!
2,Not a good example,Learning from any kind of Math book is very beneficial with a set of good examples. This book could be improved by 80% with more examples. Not worth (the money).
2,Very dense,"This book is very hard to get into....few examples, and fewer lines of practical ""how do I solve problems of this type?"" info. You're left on your own to do the problems, which are long and very tedious."
5,This is Chekhov's REAL Masterpiece,"I still can never figure out why ""The Cherry Orchard"" is hailed as his masterpiece and put in all the Drama anthologies to represent his work. To me ""Ivanov"", ""The Sea Gull"" and ""Uncle Vanya"" are his great works. ""The Sea Gull"" however ranks on the top of my list as his best work. A tragic tale of the meaning of love and being an artist with comic tones and timeless characters. All of the emotions and situations are realistic to real life. The play is more personal and has more meaning than average Realism. The first time I saw ""The Sea Gull"" I fell in love with it so much I saw it the next day again. It's one of the rare four act plays that I can enjoy the whole performance and not be bored. Anyone who wants to see Chekhov's brilliance should read this play and the others I mentioned."
2,Wonderful until its washed,"The concept is perfect. It's perfect to take with you for those times like traveling and wanting to let your baby roll around in the airport while waiting for your flight. First time I washed it following instruction, I noticed little bit of stuffing came out. No biggy. Next time I washed it, it came covered in its stuffing that is stuck on and does not brush off. With a young baby licking and sucking on everything, I cannot use this anymore. I was heartbroken since I am still not able to find a travel mat like this that is cushioned enough and folds up so nicely with handle. Beautiful concept but I will be returning this product."
1,Imitation Perfume,"I'm fairly certain that this is not an authentic product. It smells completely different than the Jivago 24K that I had from Nordstrom. I'm very disappointed in the quality and would certainly not recommend purchasing anything at all from this retailer. I thought I would save some money, but I ended up with a substandard product. Very irritating."
2,Jivago 24K?,The perfume that I ordered did not smell like the Jivago that I have been wearing for years! I had my friend and Husband also give me their thoughts--they both agreed it wasn't the same. The pump on the bottle also did not function properly... :/
2,I must have made an error .... Book WAY TOO BIG,"Silly Sally is one of my very favorite books. Apparently, I made a mistake when ordering, because I was SHOCKED when I received this book. It is too large to even look at. Disappointed, and will return."
3,Just OK,"The pictures are fun and the rhyming is good in this one. I just don't think it's that great is all. It's not that funny. I love Audrey Wood, she's fantastic. Maybe if you're in on the joke or have a child named Sally or something then it's funnier. Really, it's ok.... I guess I just had higher expectations considering the author. My son, age 3, also thought it was just ok. It just didn't make either one of us laugh and he's never asked for it again.If you're looking for a great book by Audrey Wood I'd recommend Quick as a Cricket or The Napping House instead."
5,The Kids Love It!,"Silly Sally went to town, walking backwards, upside down. On the way she meets some more silly characters in this short, cleverly rhymed book. Preschoolers love to hear it over and over, and older kids and adults just memorize the rhymes, and we can ""read"" it (recite it) any where, any time!Great fun."
5,Stars for Silly Sally,"Can Audrey and Don Woods go wrong? I have not seen a single book by this pair that I haven't liked. I love the illustrations as usual, but I really love the meter of the text and the way it is combined and placed with the illustrations. It has a very musical quality and really lends itself to being read aloud. I have it almost memorized after only a few readings. I think I probably like to read it more than my daughter :-)"
4,Cute book,"Repetitive rhyming and cute illustrations makes this an easy book for our independent 2 1/2 year-old to ""read"" to us. Short sentences per page. Love the ""silliness"" of the story for little ones. Glad we could purchase as a board book, so it will last."
3,review for Silly Sally,"Silly Sally is a great childrens book, it's a book for bigginer readers. It's fun and easy to read with an easy vocabulary and its rhyming format. The book Silly Sally is about a girl named Sally who goes to town walking backwards upside down. On her trip through town she meets different animals who she engages in different activities with. Then she meets Ned Buttercup who walks forward rightside up. Ned tickles all the animals as well as Sally who is sleeping. He wakes them up and they continue there journey together animals and all."
3,A silly story indeed.,"Silly Sally offers rhyming rolled into a cumulative tale à la ""This Is the House That Jack Built"" not to mention Audrey Wood's ownThe Napping House, the latter of which I prefer over Silly Sally. For a buttercup, Neddy is a bit of a fruitcake.This is a short, silly book whose reading experience will be optimized by paying close attention to the objects in the background as Sally approaches town. I don't think many people will find a reason to dislike this book but nor do I expect it to be everyone's favorite.3.5 stars. Rounding down because it simply isn't a book my kids request."
5,Amazing!,"My 2 1/2 year old son is crazy about this book! I never write reviews, but this book is so amazing that I had to say something! We read it over and over, it gets him up to bed eagerly instead of my having to chase him around the house. That in itself is worth it! It is also enjoyable for adults, I have not gotten tired of it either. A couple of sentences a page, great pictures and really fun. Perfect for a 2-3 year old who wants a story, but not too many words on each page. Also perfect for boys who like being ""upsidedown"". My son has at least 100 books, and this is in his top 3, he wants to read it every night."
5,Must have!,"This is such a great book! My 2 and 4 year old love it! It's a must have, espcially for little girls!"
5,Silly Sally review,The book is my daughter's favorite. She loves that she has her own copy of this book. Amazon got it to us extremely fast!
4,"Good printer, excellent features for the money","The printer has mediocre graphics output, so if you need high-grade graphics output, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a decent, mid-grade quality color laser, you won't get more features and better performance for the money. Duplex and network support come standard. Power consumption isn't bad either; note the reviews of many other color lasers that people put in there homes only to blow circuits. Network configuration is a little clumsy, but even a novice should be able to get through it."
1,Unreliable Printer,"This printer is terrible. You cannot print more than 5 pages at a time without the printer rollers heating up and damaging the paper. It is very sensitive to the weight of the paper. Essentially, you cannot you any medium to heavy weight paper with this printer. Worst printer I have ever bought and/or used."
2,"Prints Well, Too Expensive to Maintain","We've had this printer in our office for 12 months and now it is no longer able to be used because the transfer belt and imaging unit have reached their predetermined copy limit. Even though they work just fine, after x amount of prints they stop working. It costs $300-$500 to replace these parts. What a joke. We even bought an extended warranty and we were sent an even more used printer without the parts in question! They're considered consumable and aren't covered by the warranties at all. I would NOT recommend buying this printer."
5,good stuff,"I have five wolfhounds, and they love to chew on these things. It's their favorite rawhide product."
2,What happened?,"Why is it that RJD2 and DJ Shadow insist on straying away from the formula? Im all for creative outlets but build on that foundation and keep the party going in each of your individual ways. Im on my second listen of the ""Third Hand"" and im not feeling it, very sleepy and for christ sake RJ sounds like Sting.Bring back Blue Print and find someone who can sing with your beats."
2,Wow. This is not what I expected at all....,"It's not like the album is bad. It's just not the RJD2 that we all knew and loved not so long ago. It's definitely pop. A blend of Jon Brion and (you'll hate me for saying it) Badly Drawn Boy. Both those artists are great, but RJD2 what have you done?!"
2,I Like the Cover Art but thats About It,"I gave this album two stars instead of one because, hey, it's RJ we're talking about here. He played most of all the instruments on the album and that is commendable. I saw The Third Hand live and he did it all. Other than that I can't stand this album. It's whiny, I can't relate with the lyrics one bit, I have no idea what he's trying to say. I'd rather listen to Brittany Spears latest album then this. I love all RJ's other work. I think he's a genius. I'm sure he was attempting to put out a brilliant album but everything went horribly awry. I feel bad for anyone who paid good money for this record, myself included. This and Shadow's Outsider are the worst albums I've heard in a long time from greatly loved artists. Hopefully his next album won't disappoint."
4,"a very-good album of the greatest spaniard ""rocker""","for all those people who would like to ear a sample of the kind of rock that we play in Spain. This is a classical album with some of the most famous songs of Loquillo: La Mataré, Mis problemas con las mujeres, El fantasma de Elvis, Siempre Libre... Loquillo keeps the flame of the pure r'n'r in Spain."
4,what a shame! it could of been perfect,oh well i guess a doll cant be perfect like this one.1.the clothes fall of or the stuff you put on the shelf with just one touch2. polly has awsome clothes but i lost many shoes and her pink slippers ripped so i had to throw them away.3. you have to have more than 3 dolls to totally enjoy it and you must have the other playsets for full enjoyment.i love this doll and this shop but what i paid for really was not worth it and it probably could have been better!
5,An interesting stick,"I admire all of Billy Cobham's work, so when I spotted these, I wanted to try them out. They are a far cry from most other sticks, being heavier and having different balance (not to mention the really interesting and useful pinky holds) than most other sticks. I highly recommend almost anything from Vic Firth. In this case, these are sticks that can actually teach you something about the art of drumming."
4,trail vs treadmill,I got this to watch while running on the treadmill and it inspired me to run on trails. Great fun!
2,Same footage used over and over and over....,"I purchased the dvd based on the previous recommendation. I did not find the dvd helpful and wish that I had saved my $29.99. I will be donating this dvd to my local library. There are some helpful tips but they could have been stated in a 5 minute podcast. The dvd uses the same running scenes over and over. I was really looking forward to some really helpful tips for ""normal"" runners. I do not see myself flying down the trails at the speed of the ""actor."" It would have been cool to show some scenes of him flying down the hill but then show techniques of running down the hill - for normal people. It reminded my a lot of a Monte Python movie, the scene where they keep running up the same hill. My recommendation, if your really want to watch it, would be to go to your local library or borrow someone's copy. I am sorry to say that it was definitely not worth the money."
5,Essential for everyone who wants to serve the Lord,"After a long period of prayer and searching for God's will for my life and having purchased already two other Dr. Kendal's books, it was a pleasure for me to read this book. I got very useful insights from the many personal stories reported as well as started to see clearer how the Holy Spirit is working in all over the world.Many times we expect from the Spirit to work in our lives and in our church as we have been used to, but the truth is that ""as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are God's ways higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts"".From now on, I will let the Spirit ""purge myself from these, so to be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work"". Because I don't want to be a yesterday man but a tomorrow one.God bless all of us..."
4,GRANDMOM BUYS BIBLE FOR ME,"YOU WILL NEED TO CHECK FOR ACCURACY WHEN READING THIS BOOK. IT HAS RAIN STARTING AS NOAH IS GETTING THE LAST ANIMALS ONTO THE ARK. WRONG! RAIN DIDN'T START UNTIL AFTER NOAH, HIS FAMILY, AND ALL THE ANIMALS WERE SAFELY CLOSED INTO THE ARK. GUESS WHO SHUT THE DOOR? GOD DID IT HIMSELF.THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE CHARMING AND VERY APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. I LIKE THE MULTIRACIAL FACE TONES OF THE CHARACTERS."
2,This item does not work as advertized,"Printed all over the box are the words ""with infrared heat"". The instructions state that you must add warm water to the machine before you start, and the infrared mechanism is supposed to maintain the water's warm temperatures. This wouldn't be the case. The water cools in a matter of minutes after turning the bubbles and massage functions on. Turning on the infrared light on top of the machine looks nice, but does nothing at all to keep the water warm."
3,For the price it is great!,This would not replace your significant other giving you a message but it is a nice relaxing way to soak your feet. Putting hot water in the basin stays warm for 15-20 min which is just about right.
4,Comforting,"Worked well and everyone in the family enjoyed it. Only downside is you have to add heated water, it does not heat the water. Still using it today and the kids love using it."
5,Dogs LOVED them!,"They are pricey, but the dogs just love them! They ate them up fast compared the the ones I buy locally. The quality of these seem much better. They are thick and have a heavy ""basting"" to them. Plus, I feel more confident giving these to my dogs since they are from Harpers uses only American rawhide. That gives me a little more reassurance in this day and age of Mad Cow's disease. I will definitely buy more."
3,Not Great but Good,112 never lets me down but this is definitly not their best... still worth the spin... best songs are NOWHERE and WHY CAN'T WE GET A LONG. The rest are just good listening.. the type the songs you groove to on a long drive!
4,welcome back,"First of all, i wasn't that keen on hot n wet, but pleasure and pain is definately in my cd player at the moment. it's definately one of their best, along with part III.My fav slow songs are nowhere, what if and that's how close we are.Basically i love every song. Even though the songs seem to be similar to that of previous albums, 112 definately have my thumbs up!! - good buy 4 all u rnb fanz out there!!"
3,112 is still the bomb!!,"I just bought this album despite all the bad reviews I've read about it. The CD isn't bad but it's not that great either. To me, their first album will always be the best. There are a few tracks on this CD that I could do without listening to like ""Closing The Club"" and ""If I Hit"", I guess because I'm just not feeling the lyrics on these two. I think the best songs on the album are ""That's How Close We Are"" and ""God Knows"". Overall, I think the album was ok. I'm still and always will be a big fan though."
5,U ALREADY KNOW they were hot,"When i first heard that 112 left bad boy i though this album was going to suck, but i was wrong i went out and bought it like every true 112 fan and i wasn't disapointed.My favorite songs:3. What if (slim let his good vocals show on this one)4. U already know (The hot single)6. Nowhere (second favorite song7. Last to know9.My mistakes (Nice ballad to ride 2)10. If i hit (a club banger)13. Why can' we get along15. Closing the club (Even mike rapped on this hot matha)17. Only god knows (My favorite song on the albumThe songs i though was pain5. Damn (cant even lisen to it11. The way (JD sucks big time)16. What the hell do you wantI liked the cd and you will too so get your ass up and go buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not as good as the first one but better than the rest....,"I give this 112 CD 4 stars..this Cd is not as good as their first CD, because of course that CD is the best CD but it's much better than the other 3. I have been an 112 CD since their first CD and the other three my disappointment has gone down. HOWEVER, with Pleasure and Pain (which is a song off their first CD) is a great CD. I don't think U Already Know should have been their first single though, I felt that Let This Go should have because it's more upbeat and U Already Know should have been their second single. They have defintely matured (I'm happy they are 100% off of the Bad Boy label) and I hope they keep coming out with CDs AS A GROUP (even though I read that they are all dropping solos, NOOOOO)...The only song I didn't like is Closing the Club with 3 6 Mafia, that could have been left on the floor."
4,112 has finally come back!,"After the disappionting 'Hot & Wet' 112 has returned with 'Pleasure & Pain', which has more good songs than bad. Mostly every track is awesome. The album could have done without ""We Goin' Be Alright"", it's so short. Anyways I am very happy with this album. The reason I gave it 4 stars b/c they changed some of the lyrics of the chorus in ""U Alredy Know""Intro= N/ALet This Go= 8/10What If= 7/10U Already Know= 10/10Damn= 9/10Nowhere= 7/10Last To Know= 8/10I'm Sorry= N/AMy Mistakes= 8/10If I Hit f/T.I.= 9/10The Way f/Jermaine Dupri= 7/10We Goin' Be Alright= 3/10Why Can't We Get Along= 6/10That's How Close We Are= 5/10Closing The Club f/Three 6 Mafia= 7/10What The Hell Do You Want= 6/10God Knows= 7/10"
1,GARBAGE,"With every CD, they seem to get worse and worse. I love 112, but this CD is just awful. I listened to it once and it never got a second go round in my CD player. What happened to real music?"
3,Good... but overrated...,112 is a very good group and they did another good job on this cd... but from what people's review and comment... also news dat been going on... seems like dis cd is a must by... but not reallie when i listen to it... the best few songs outta da cd are down dur... one is a complete song.. other wun is interlude.. dats how good the cd is- im sorry [interlude]- why cant we get along .... best songtrash >> closin the club + the way
1,Worst 112 CD Yet!,"First of all, I love 112. Their first three albums are in HEAVY rotation in my iPod. But since they left Bad Bay, they have fallen apart. This last CD is worst than the previous one. They are too old to sing about sex in the manner that they do. They sound like Camron and 13 year old boys. I was appalled by ""If I Hit"" and ""Closing the Club"". NO wonder this had a parental advisory sticker. But beyond the crazy sex stuff, this CD just sucks. The lyrics are bad, the production goes from cast-off Boyz II Men ballads to Casio beats. If you love 112, stay away from this, and remember the way they were."
2,Pleasure & Pain--they're half-right,"All four members have ample singing time this time around but the material is still mediocre. ""U Already Know"" was a hit but their follow-up(s) weren't. They've been in the business for ten years now and they can sing but they got the wrong team working with them. Leave Def Soul and get some better writers/producers."
3,"It's okay, but could be better","Hmm, I'm not sure if I like it or I dislike it. Yes, it is well put together and 112 still maintain their unique stylings. But is it what I expected? Sorry, no.I feel as if this album is a bit too confusing. There are moments when I feel they have their old skool feel back on some ballads, but then again there are some beats that attempt to be in line with what we would consider pop-rnb today. Maybe it is a sense that they tried a bit too hard on this album? Judge for yourself. Listening to their old single, 'Cupid' and comparing it to any track on this album; that's where I find it ambiguous.Have they improved and grown as artists? Have they truly found a new niche for them? A part of me feels that their best feature are their vocal skills and somehow they've taken a step back in that area. What happened to heart wrenching rnb acappella?"
1,Boring,if 112 drops a Greatest Hits then I truly feel that is as good as it will ever get. also I give them Props for hanging around longer than most R&B Groups because the days of the R&B group that is Beyond there Teenage years is very rare.heck the days of the R&B group period that makes more than 3 albums is a rarity.having said all of that 112 drops a Album that is formula driven&Is tired before it even wakes up which it never does.i think they did there best work while on Bad Boy.
4,"All Pleasure, No Pain","Everybody loved their debut, which included the major hit ""Only You"" and some really good slow jams... ""Room 112"" followed, which was a great sophmore release, but didn't match up to the debut. Part III put 112 back on the map, a really good record, which kinda reminds me of 112's new effort. ""Pleasure & Pain"" is a good mix of uptempo songs ""Let This Go"", ""U Already Know"" and ""The Way"" and some beautiful, heartfelt ballads ""Nowhere"" and ""That's How Close We Are"". I enjoyed 112's new cd, and it's waaay better than ""Hot & Wet"". They are back, let's hope that Boyz II Men can do the same..."
2,A bit of disappointment,"I read about this band and was intrigued enough to pick up their CD. I like straight ahead bar room/garage rock and was interested to hear their supposedly political lyrics. Unfortunately, I found their music very pedestrian and cliched. The songwriting is rather trite... the guitar riffs and chord progressions sound like something a second year guitar student would rip out practicing in their bedroom. The singer is decent but none of the songs stand out as anything more than standard garage rock. There are probably hundreds of unsigned bands out there with more original music than this. But, if you like grinding bar rock then this might satisfy. It's not terrible, just terribly average."
5,Man of a Thousand Faces,"This is a fantastic bio. Thank your lucky stars that Universal reissued it. I only wish that the makeup dealing with Lon Chaney was not underplayed. James Cagney was terrific and so were Dorothy Malone and Jane Greer. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!"
2,what chaney might have been like,"This is what I imagine Lon Chaney's life would have been like if he had been James Cagney. Unfortunately I wondered what the ""man of mystery"" himself was really like, and care little for another soap-opera twisting of reality by Hollywood script-writers.Yes, there are people out here who are actually looking to learn something about the subjects of biopics and, once more, we have an example of the fictionalisation of fact Hollywood-style. What is the point?Don't tell me that the truth doesn't matter; people actually believe this stuff and it is apparently fundamentally untrue."
2,Doesn't fit everything as advertised,Description says it will fit a H&K P2000. It doesn't fit as advertised and isn't very concealed. It's very obvious when it is on your ankle that you are wearing a holster on your ankle. The holster has a very obvious stick when you try to remove the weapon. Not very functional or concealable.
3,go big,Went with the guidelines they provided to help determine what size my son would need - he will not even get a summer out of this shirt - my little guy sizing was perfect - older kids not so much
3,50% Failure Rate,"I bought a pair of these DIMM's. About 2 weeks later I started getting system errors & random problems when booting. My first thought was that I had a virus, so I spend a lot of time and effort doing scans with my anti-virus software and doing 'rollbacks' with Windows. Since I was running fine for a couple of weeks after I installed these, I didn't think of the DIMM's at first. Finally as a last resort, I pulled them both out of my machine and Voila... no more boot errors, blue screens or random software failures. I reinstalled them one at a time and narrowed the problem down to one bad DIMM. Unfortunatly after all that... it was too late (past 30 days) to return to the seller."
3,Quality is decent but assembly leaves much to be desired,"The quality of this item is pretty good, at least as it relates to the metal pieces. However, assembly can be difficult due to the near to hammer the poles together, and even then they never seem to fit snug. Also, the balancing act required to get the first set of poles into the shelves and correctly seat the plastic stoppers is difficult. Overall I am satisfied with the product but would have preferred something requiring less assembly that resulted in better quality overall."
2,not sturdy and wheels worthless with a load,These shelves are very wobbly and you can't even move the wheels when it has anything heavy on it. Not worth the money.
5,Sturdy and attractive,"This is a perfect solution for holding all the bulk buys I pick up at the discount club store. It has transformed the closet under the stairs into a storage unit. Love it! Easy to put together, no nuts bolts or screwdrivers!"
3,Not quite as advertised,"The description of this product indicates that each shelf holds 350 pounds (or 500 pounds, depending on which part of the description you read) and the photo clearly shows the NSF stamp on the shelving. However, the shelving that arrived is rated at 200 pounds/shelf and is not NSF certified. It wasn't a deal breaker, but I was a bit disappointed. (I chose this unit over another less expensive one because it was supposedly NSF certified.) The shelving went together easily and is of adequate quality. However, the wheels are difficult to lock."
1,Horrible customer service,I called their customer service line to ask for a missing part and had to deal with a very rude and unappreciative agent. Great product - horrible customer service.
1,Stay away from these...,"OK, so you see them on every cooking show on TV. Are they that good? Not likely. I broke mine very quickly making a 1-loaf(!) recipe of toasting bread, using King Arthur bread-machine flour. The gear-box seized after several runs where is plainly overheated(!), even though I was running it at a fast speed to avoid just that. 10 minutes of kneading high-gluten flour is too much for this machine. ""Commercial"" is just something dreamed up in the marketing department of KitchenAid. Their engineers did a really lousy job - you can read more reviews on epinions.com.So, I searched and found a Bosch Universal - a 700W unit. Tried the same bread I killed my KitchenAid with. I had to make a double batch for the machine to even sound like it was working on something and not just turning in thin air! Spend your money on that instead! (It is NOT more expensive). It beats the Kitc+henAid hands down. Hats off to German Engineering!"
1,Don't lose the manual,I've had this for over a year. You will get no support for this product. A call the HoMedics gets you to a talking box that refers everything to their meagre website. The website is of no use whatsoever. There are no links to the manual for this product - in fact they do not even acknowledge the existence of the product on their website. If you buy this product you are on your own.
1,Offensive at many levels!,"All right, I will admit that I laughed out loud when Parker compared a human tongue to a cow's udder - what a word picture! But I can't imagine who wouldn't take offense at this book. High ranking Catholic cardinals are depicted as scheming power mongers, the one black person mentioned is murderous, all of the seemingly intelligent women are doomed to impossible relationships with men, the Germans are conscienceless mercenaries, and the only Muslim is a fanatic. And this is all in addition to the concern anyone might have about an author just making up an account of Jesus' childhood and his post-resurrection relationship with Mary. I kept thinking things had to get better but they never did."
2,Flimsy,"Very lightweight; doesn't feel like a quality product. I have the Gingher pocket scissors & love them, so would rather pay the extra money for another pair of those. I lhave lots of Gingher scissors, & I love that I can send them to the factory for sharpening & readjustment when necessary. I have dropped scissors a couple of times & I would rather be able to get them readjusted than to have to buy another pair."
4,Nice bow-tie,"I ordered this for an upcoming wedding. I was very nervous as you never know what color you're really going to get. I needed a plain, crayon purple. Well, that's exactly what I got. It was such a relief. And it matched the ties I ordered at he same time.Thank you so much!!"
4,Nice quilt but listing is misleading,"I like the looks of this quilt. It really brightens up the room. HOWEVER after lengthy communication with Amazon about whether or not it was machine washable, they finally said it was. The label on the quilt, and the label on the outside of the mfr packaging, clearly states it is ""dry clean only"". How difficult could this sort of thing be to figure out???"
3,Pem America Sari Queen Patchwork Quilt,"The quilt is extremely beautiful, yet not very durable. I bought this quilt several months ago. Already, the seams connecting the patches together are coming apart. To me this suggests the quilt is not meant for everyday use."
4,HUSKY LINERS 15330 5TH W.T.G. RAM P/U 02-06,"WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE LINER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO INSTALL IF THE CABLES HAD BEEN INCLUDED SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO REMOVE THEM FROM OUR ORIGINAL TAILGATE. ALSO, IT REQUIRES CLOSING PRETTY HARD FOR THE LATCH TO CATCH. LOOKS REALLY NICE."
3,install was kind of a pain,"First, this product is beautifully welded and finished. And all the hardware seems first rate. However, on my 2005 Ram 2500, the install was more than I bargained for. The hinge ends actually had to be trimmed a bit before it would fit! I took a bit less than 1/4"" off each end and deburred them. Went right on, then. The latch strikers needed spaced out (I used 2 flat washers on each side, but the OEM washers are threaded so they weren't really necessary) and adjusted for position. Striker adjustment is noted in the instructions.And if you used an EZ Down on your OEM gate (which you don't need now) and tossed the original cable mount like I did, the EZD supplied one will need a lot of relieving."
2,"Also, disappointed in this book.","A was disappointed in this book.I also, miss the John Lloyd Branson series. Meredith has another book coming out Jan.2001 titled "" Murder Past Due"" I do not know which series it comes from though."
4,Fun and lighthearted.,"This is a fun lighthearted book. It's what I like to call a ""easy read"". This book is easy to read at work or in a waiting room. The story line is fun and made me giggle at times. Not your edge of your seat murder mystery, but It did keep my attention all the way to the end!I plan on reading more of D.R. Meredith's books in the future."
5,Terrific little book on John Milton,"This is a lovely little book on John Milton. Written in 1915 it is one of the most perceptive readings of the character of the man I have come across. While in appropriate awe of his subject, Bailey never loses perspective of Milton's flaws and humanity. Bailey's readings of the poems are intelligent and elegant. Bailey's scholarship is never heavy handed but is infused with insights and a great love of his subject. It captures, in its brevity, much more than many longer books on Milton, which might be why, after all these years it is still in print."
2,A bit loud,"This Kurt Kinetic is a very well made piece of equipment. It is very sturdy and was easy to put together. You may ask why I gave it two stars, I have one word for you ""noise"".I read reviews that the wind trainers get loud if you pedal fast. Unfortunately, mine was loud even at very low speeds. It was loud enough that I can not get a workout on the bike and listen to the radio or watch a show on my computer.The bottom line is if a very loud wooshing noise like driving a car with your windows open at moderate to high speeds does not bother you, this trainer could be what you want at a decent price. If you are like me and the noise bothers you so much you don't use the trainer, buy a fluid or magnetic model."
1,noise in kinetic,"This was a Christmas present to me from my husband who knows I love to ride and want to stay in shape during the cold winter months. But the NOISE is horrible!!!!!! I can't say enough about that. Ok, it's sturdy, doesn't tip over, etc but you can't stand the noise after about 2 minutes! TV, Itunes, forget it. You will be deaf from noise pollution before you ride a week!"
2,Doesn't brush between teeth,"It doesn't brush well between teeth. At first I thought it was gentle on my gum line so I ended up buying the bulk. Now I have to wait about a year before I buy Oral B or somekind that will brush well between teeth.If you are looking for gentle on gum, this is it.If you are looking for clean feeling after brush, I wouldn't recommend this."
3,SANFORD Works for some not all,"Hello Amazon Buyers,Before buying the product...I want you to consider a few things. First, be aware that he has a throat like symptom that I am not completely sure how he could talk...Anyway if that is a bother...I would save the $70 dollars because its on both DVDs.Also, keep in mind that this is similar to the work on his book on Acting. He has very insightful information about the craft...however it is not for everyone. Please make sure that its not STRASBERG or STANISLAVSKY...it is MEISNER.Would recommend this to anyone wanting to further educate themselves on the craft of acting.Thank you."
1,Unbearable to watch,"What genius destroys his instrument not just once but three times? As brilliant as this teacher may have been, he was not ""true to his own voice."" Before considering the purchase of this DVD, customers should know that Meisner has to ""burp"" his words since he has literally destroyed his throat through a lifetime of smoking and from several operations for throat cancer. Thus he sounds like a frog throughout, and only the most dedicated will be able to sit through the croaking. Definitely not for younger audiences. Despite the tragedy, he and many of his students continue to smoke heavily throughout the program. If it had been recorder when he could speak normally, it probably would have been a treasure, but at least for me, it was unbearable to watch and ruined the lessons which might at one time have been worth learning."
2,Boring!,"I found that I just really didn't care about any of these people. There was nothing really intriguing or surprising. People change, or don't. It probably would have been more interesting if I'd known them."
1,Simply awful; a weak attempt at meaningfulness.,"What Really Happened is a poor attempt at conjuring up powerful memories of high school. The main reason for this is a format issue, I think. Had the author only written about a few people more in depth, I think the book would have been a much more interesting read. Instead, Chris Colin has broken his whole high school class down into different stereotypes and them summed up their lives in two sentences. Garbage."
2,"Disappointing, incomplete, and exploitative.","Disclaimer: I was the in the TJ class of '94.Colin tries to argue that the class of '93 had hope, and then lost it, and is kind of lost trying to find it again. He uses learning about LGBT rights as a metaphor for the social consciousness of '93, so a substantive discussion about the ongoing study of race (or class!) has no place in his story.I do think he has a rough sense that something is wrong with this picture, and that's why he repeatedly and awkwardly returns to the issue of race. I wish he had been less defensive and made more of an effort to engage those issues.And as a friend of Sean Bryant's, I think making his story the last chapter is inappropriate and exploitative. All of the other stuff aside, that alone makes me feel uncomfortable."
3,"Similar to the first, for better or for worse","""Havin' More Fun"" is an old Bing Crosby radio show with Louis Armstrong, among others, as a guest. I would suggest to whoever might consider buying this that this CD, as the first, is a mix of solo and duet. If I have a CD featuring Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong, I personally would like them to sing together throughout the entire disc. Other CD's acommodate this, and so I would stick with those."
5,The Healing Cookbook : Healthy Heart,"I bought this cookbook on the recommendation of a family friend who is an internist, and have since recommended it to 4 physicians. I never expected to find more than 2 or 3 recipes that I would use more than once, but every one I've tried is incredibly good, and I use the book regularly. The recipes are simple and easy to follow, and nearly every one is pictured with an attractive--and accurate--photograph of the finished product. The entrees are especially successful, low in fat and yet exceptionally flavorful, thanks to the ample use of spices, garlic, and unexpected combinations of ingredients. At the same time, the recipes are not too exotic, nor do they require a great deal of skill to achieve great results. This is not your usual diet cookbook! I recommend it highly to anyone who needs to lose or maintain weight--it's a book that you will go to again and again and one that will actually make it easy to eat a healthy diet."
3,Childhood Memories,"I remember this film from childhood, seeing the coming attractions at the local theater for what seemed like months before it finally came. I realy loved this dino-drama at age 6 and have been searching for it on DVD for years. Unique ""comet sweeps up two dualing men"" plot, with old stock footage of iguanas playing dinosaurs from ""One Million Years B.C"". Sentimental value only, but worth the price to me. An added bonus: Joan Staley from ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" looks much hotter here than in that Don Knotts classic, something I didn't notice back then."
3,Great Album!,"I recently discovered Peter Gabriel's music after watching an interview he did for a music channel. I downloaded a few of his songs, and I instantly fell in love with his big hits. I decided to buy several of his albums on vinyl(Where I live most stores primarily sell vinyl plus its cheaper). This album is awesome! It's really fun and creative. I really liked San Jaquinto. It's an excellent track. In the interview he talked about experimenting with sound and trying to do something out of the box. Well on Vinyl this still holds up 25+ year later. It's a great mix of industrial and blues rock. I really enjoyed 'Shock the Monkey'. It has to be one of the more catchy tracks on the albums. I have the Touch and Kiss of Life are also very good tracks. Family and the Fishing Net was alittle odd, but It fits well with the album's theme. I would buy this album if your a huge music fan, it's worth the money."
5,A Groundbreaking Classic Album,"Tony Levin on Bass (the only bass player ever to play on a Peter Gabriel album, in fact), Jerry Marotta on drums. These guys form the low end of a masterpiece here, where another reviewer rightly pointed out the high end is where Gabriel's voice lives. The contrast hear is what is scaring many of the people. It's a harmonizing of the fear one feels at contacting one's archetypical self, and Gabriel teases that out of us, as though a mythic martial artist presenting us with our own heart before we've realized what he's done.Just The Rhythm of the Heat itself sounds like it stepped out of Carl Jung's consciousness witnessing the african drum circle Jung wrote about. Peter Gabriel makes pop and rock music more expansive and lush for his presence, all while somehow remaining memorable and catchy. Buy it."
4,Secure Gabriel,"Peter Gabriel's 4th album ""Security"" is a subtle blend of tracks, and it took me quite some time to appreciate them. My favorite track is probably ""The Family and the Fishing Net"", an intense piece that takes a twisted perspective on a wedding, and my least favorite's probably ""San Jacinto"", which gets a bit repetitive in the rhythm department. ""Shock the Monkey"" is kinda catchy, while ""Wallflower"" is profound and bittersweet. ""Kiss of Life"", with it's uptempo, soupy sounding drums, is a very unusual way to end this kind of record, I thought.I'd recommend picking up Peter Gabriel's first album before this one, as that has slightly more sonic variety. I like ""Security"", but it does feel a bit distant and set apart."
5,"What's ""world music"" ?","Until this album and Paul Simon's ""Graceland"", not too many Westerners knew. I wish I knew what instrument produced that recurring bass note in the opener ""Rhythm Of the Heat"". Is it a drum? A synthesizer? Maybe a processed bass? A killer sound, I know that. When I played it at a local gig, I had to sample both that and the ""chunga-chunga"" rhythm figure. Which tied up both ends of my sampler. Bummer. ""Lay Your Hands On Me"" is another hard-to-pin-down number. There's an element of world music to it. But does the fact that most of it's spoken make it rap-related? Not even the fact that Gabriel crowd-surfed during live performances (MTV or what?) entirely spoiled my appreciation of the track. One other thing this album is--it's the logical transition between his ""no title"" period and the P-G of today."
3,Not his best stuff,"Uneven album which features some good songs (like Shock the Monkey - what is that song about ?), but some poor ones, and which for some strange reason, features several of the songs recorded at a very low volume. Not as good as his others."
5,Great gift,The earrings are nice quality and the color of the pearl is nice and copper-y. Actual product matched description of item.
2,not too coppery,"I love copper and thought these earrings would be special, but they aren't coppery at all. The ""pearl"" is a light orangeish-yellow and not at all what I wanted."
4,LJ4240N,The printer is one we have ordered before and works very well for the application we are purchasing them for. The only problem was during shipment a part became dislodged and we had to repair it.
2,Silk Screen Effect was a deal breaker....,"Let me start out by saying despite being disappointed with this TV Amazons service was excellent. I have nothing but good things to say about Amazon and Ceva (Eagle). I ended up returning this TV and going with a Samsung LCD instead. I've looked at the HLT5676S in big box stores and never noticed this ""Silk Screen Effect"", but at home it was unbearable. I'm not sure if it was my viewing conditions or just this particular TV. After reading in some forums that this is a major problem with rear projection TVs I decided to go with an LCD instead."
1,Samsung HL-T5676S Channel Problems,"I love the TV... hate the firmware problems. When I delete channels in the 115 range, they keep coming back. I tried everything to fix the problem. I called technical support and they were absolutely no help.Great TV... sound is very poor and the channel saving options do not work properly on some channels."
2,I returned it...,"The Silk Screen Effect was way too distracting for me. I just can't justify spending this much money on a television and having everything look like I'm watching it through a piece of silk that covers the screen. 1080P and my Blu Rays don't look nearly as crisp when the screen has a visual distraction.I'm not saying the tv is awful, but for my money plasma is 10x better...even if I have to buy a 50 inch for the same price.(Check out the Panny 50PX77U. It has an AMAZING PICTURE.)Don't let the Big Box stores fool you with this tv. This Samsung looks GREAT at BB. No Silk Screen at all.Imagine your disappointment when you get it hooked up...No more DLP for me!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!,"I had this TV. Twice. Both times the cabinet was so flimsy that it couldn't hold the screen flat enough to get a true picture. On both models I had the screen was extremely bowed. I've heard it called the Samsung Smiley face effect. Samsung made the TV out of really cheap materials to make it light enough to mount on a wall, but who would mount their DLP on a wall anyway? I think they made it cheap, then noticed it was light and used that as an excuse. Either way, its a shame becuase the picture was simply amazing, you know, aside from being intolerably skewed. Don't take your chances on this TV. Your money would be much better spent on a slightly smaller LCD, like the LN-T4665 or the 4661."
4,One weak area,"With a component video hookup the set allows for an adequate number of aspect ratio adjustments to make the picture fill out the screen to best effect with just about any DVD movie source you can think of.However, if one uses an HDMI hookup with a BluRay player two of the aspect-ratio adjustment options are no longer available. Even the owner's manual acknowledges this, as did a Samsung tech rep I talked with. (He was as mystified by the lack of this feature with the HDMI hookup as I am.) With most DVD and BluRay movies this is no big deal. However, with one DVD I watched today it was, and I had to watch it on my secondary, non BluRay player that is hooked up with the component connection. Without the HDMI hookup I could not take advantage of the upconvert feature my BluRay player offers with standard DVD movies.Otherwise, this is a fine set."
1,Awful skewed partisan stance,"To use Sarah Palin as the advocate for what is right, which Ziegler later went against, seems fitting enough as an endorsement or lack thereof for this terribly skewed partisan piece."
1,one-sided bias?,"Much of what was called biased during the election were the candidates very own words. The media can't ""getcha"" if there's nothing to get. Facts are never biased --how they're reported can and usually does add bias these days.This comes off as if the media didn't persistently repeat lies, previously refuted, about President Obama as so-called ""news"".The bias during the last election pales compared to what passes as ""news"" today! Opinions should not be sold to consumers as news and are inheritently BIASED.The answer is to look at who owns the media and you'll find the bias always falls in the media owner's favor, of course, and serves the owner's best interests.Fact checking ALWAYS helps!"
3,Not-so-Handy Guide to Trees & Shrubs,All black & white with detailed written descriptions.Needed color and clearer photos or drawings.
3,"Average - not bad, but not the best cheap flashlight","Purchased one of these flashlights, along with several other cheap flashlight brands, just to have a few scattered around my home. This one is decent; functional and simple to use. It's fairly large though, compared to other inexpensive flashlights. The size might be a plus for some, especially if you are searching for it during a blackout. Due to its bulk and cartoony plastic casing, it feels cheap. Also, I found the light to be somewhat dim compared to the other brands I purchased.Of the inexpensive flashlights I sampled, my favorite was the ""CSI LUMA Flashlight"", which you can find by searching that text in Amazon. I highly recommend the CSI LUMA, although the captioned flashlight is not a bad purchase either."
4,Nice flashlight...,"I have ordered this flashlight before and every time, so far, it works well. It is simple, lasts about 2 years ( I looked on Amazon the last time I order one) and it was 2 years ago since the other one went out. When I read about this flashlight recently, it said it lasts about 2 years and low and behold, it does. The price is good and I would recommend this product."
5,Awesome Seller!,"This seller is awesome. I e-mail to request him for my prompt shipment and he made it for me. Everything's great. Before I decided to buy it with him, I have read all reviews to make sure that he's the good seller and customer will get their order in time. Yes, he is that kinda guy. I'm so happy to get my order before my friend left from the U.S to bring back it to me at home. Thank you so much for your wonderful help! I will recommend my friends to buy stuffs from you......Piyanuch"
1,StarForce!!!,"This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear."
4,Have fun playing; forget Starforce,"I too was wary about Starforce at first, but most of what you read about this copy protection is overblown rumors. It does not ""drain CPU power,"" damage your computer, or any of that nonsense. The people who hate Starforce are either ignorant, responding in knee-jerk fashion to issues they don't understand, or pirates who'd rather not have to purchase the game. Rush for Berlin is an incredibly well-done game with great graphics and fun gameplay. There are 4 campaigns with optional and secret objectives, and 5 multiplayer modes, making for a lot of replay with this title. Try the demo before you buy, both single and multiplayer, and see if you agree."
1,not working under Windows 7 and no more support anywhere,"Bought this game recently, knowing that Windows7 allows you to play older games..But this game has something called Starforce protection which is blocking any attempt to play the game under Windows 7...So DO NOT buy this game !"
3,Disappointing damaged costume,I purchased this costume for my daughter for halloween and when she received it she was so excited! When she tried it on however we noticed that there was a huge hole in one of the legs and there was not a velcro dot included to affix the contestant number on the shirt... Very disappointing in deed!
2,Mediocre,"I didn't love or hate this product. I'm just waiting till it runs out, but will probably never buy again. I use it to leave in my hair so that my curls will stay in place and be more defined (I'm African American). Other conditioners that I use to do the same thing have better results. For normal conditioning, it was ok...nothing great about it. In fact every conditioner I have is probably better at conditioning than this one. Sorry, I wanted to like it."
5,go bucks,a great product for any osu fan. perfect addition to any osu room. material is stretchy and will fit over any seat. easy to clean and well worth the money....GO BUCKS!!!!!!
1,Not what is pictured and cheaply made,"The item I received looks nothing like the picture. What I received is only red, white and gray and no black. It looks very cheap and tacky!! I was expecting a typical seat cover and got a very flimsy cheaply made item. Very disappointed!"
4,"Not as pictured, but still cool","it is still a great product. it fits like its supposed to, kinda hangs in the back so i just taped it under the back. but it does not look like the picture. it has no black in it at all. its a great product. glad i got it. i am satisfied with it. but the picture should be changed to represent what it actually looks like. the accents in my bathroom (rugs & such) are black so its doesn't exactly match."
2,More for British Historians...,"This piece came to my attention while conducting research for a thesis on the Black Death. Unfortunately, Platt's work is really only designed for British Historians. While he does recount how resurgence of bubonic plague in late-medieval England affected the country's economic and labor systems, he does so without consistancy. The bulk of this text provides overly detailed examinations of how the plague spread between specific towns and counties, with only minimal, and rather sporadic, discussion of how society as a whole reacted to the epidemic. Again, this work will not give you a holistic viewpoint of how the plague interacted with social, cultural, medical, etc factors of the day. Its only use is to those who wish to understand, in depth, how the labor system of late-medieval England changed due to the fluctuating mortality rates."
4,"A true account of life, not just disability","I read this autobiography for an Occupational Therapy graduate school course. I was truly, truly inspired by Ruth's story. It opened my eyes to what the proper medical treatment of an individual SHOULD be. Mind, Body, and Spirit all need to be addressed. Ruth can be proud that her story will literally shape the way in which I will practice Occupational Therapy in the future. Her struggles will be my fuel toward change and healing. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for having the courage to put her story into writing."
4,Sad but true,I read this as a result of being interested in the day to day operations of the school from a resident's or staff's perspective. This book was a sad account of one woman's mistreatment but inspiring in her persistence to communicate with the world. I'm amazed at what she has accomplished despite her disability. She is a role model and inspiration.
2,Metheny As Dr. Frankenstein,"The musical performance is spectacular, but the silhouette's, back lit hi contrast lighting and editing are terrible. For me this video was a challenge to view for more than 20 minutes. I'm not sure what the film director was trying to accomplish but I felt the director was filming a Dr. Frankenstein movie with Pat as Dr Frankenstein when he'd be better served filming Einstein. Visually the robots don't come alive. I was never able to connect with the performer. It was a challenging video project that lacked creativity and thoughtful story telling. I found a disconnect between the music and the video. If Walt Disney or Steve Jobs were in charge of this video how would they make this video? The saving grace is the outstanding audio quality you get from a DVD vs a CD. Sorry Pat just plain hard on the eyes. No visual creativity. Just a cookie cutter approach to making this video. BTW you get some great music that wasn't available on the CD."
4,everything you ever wanted to know about being a tour guide,"I recently took a college level course in a hospitality and tourism curriculum and this was the text used for the class. I was skeptical as to what a book could teach you about being an effective tour guide. During the class I had the opportunity to lead a group to London for a 9 day tour. I was amazed at the many tips the book gave that were helpful. He discusses the psychological aspects of ""herding instincts"" and how people can revert to childish behavior when they submit all decision making for a week or two to a tour guide. It includes tips on how to set up a tour package and how to get the best deals from hotels and airlines. He also discusses the different types of guide jobs including positive and negatives aspects of each. Very Helpful book!"
1,NOT a USB KVM cable,"I ordered this cable, expecting to receive a USB KVM cable, and in fact it is a PS/2 KVM cable. There is no USB connector of any sort on this cable. The part number is CSWUSBPS218.One end of the cable (which would connect to the computer) has a male VGA connector, male headphone and mic connectors, and a PS/2 keyboard and PS/2 mouse connector.The other end of the cable (which would connect to your KVM switch) has a male VGA-style connector, a male headphone and mic connector.If your computers or servers do not have PS/2 keyboard and mouse connectors and have only USB connectors, you will need to buy additional dongles, adapters, or USB cables to connect them to your KVM. This cable will not do it for you."
1,If I could have put Zero (Stars) I would,"You might enjoy this tape if you are either dead, fictional, or non-existant."
5,Very timely,My product came just as they said it would. The shipped the product the next day. Definetely a good buy!
3,Worth seeing!,"Jean Dominique contributed a lot to our country's history and its view of the press. Though an obvious ulterior agenda motivated this documentary it nontheless told the story of a very admired and possible leader of Haiti if were ever interested. I just wished it pushed further into rumored ""lavalas"" involvement in this man's death...maybe that's just not important. It's just sad that only half of this story was told...SEE IT SO YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF."
2,not what expected,i was expecting a group of naked guys excercising together with a lot of focus on the male pelvic region. the video showed one guy at a time in a nature scene excercising by himself. a little disappointed.
4,I'll give you 4 stars for this one,"I found this informative and enjoyable to watch. Sure they are muscle jocks, but then that's what the ultimate goal is... isn't it? - well for some maybe, but I thought it was reasonably well done. Some nice camera work, some great suggestions. Now if only I could utilize what I've learned at the gym as naked as they are :)."
2,outdated,"not impressed by the quality of image, should update to high def...or redo it with actual XXI century athletes...but the actual exercises are well executed, taking all the body into account."
4,"I loved the ""Love Story"" soundtrack!","I loved the movie ""Love Story."" But as my friends and I say, what makes the movie good is the music. The music is everything. People get all their emotions from movies from the music. Obviously, if the acting is good, as the actors in the movie are, it sure helps, but the music needs to be good. The music is wonderful, as I have already stated. Since the movie has both sad and happy times, the music matches. It brings everything to life. I hope people listen to this soundtrack. It was great and I hope everybody else likes it!"
2,Book is from Gayendra's Perspective,The book implicitly seems to think that the son killed their parents over what appears to be a minor disagreement. The only beneficiary was King Gayendra. There is a book on that - Raktakunda.Not sure who is right but assuming that King Gayendra's version as history is ridiculous.
4,Rhythm Sticks,Great construction. My children like to use them on the drum. Just be careful because your child could get hurt if not supervised while playing with them.
1,Two Dead Migo's,"I purchased Forward Solution's Migo earlier this year. The product has now stopped working twice. I returned the first one and they gladly replaced it, a little too glady perhaps. The second has just died about the fourth time I synchronized it. I am throwing it in the trash."
2,Migo and Tablet PCs,This device initially worked on my Tablet PC and then incompatibility. Just got off the phone from Forward Solutions Tech Support and they stated that they do not support the MIGO and Tablet PCs. I need to return. I am very disappointed. The Migo looked like it was going to be a great product for me to use. Initially a 5 star and now a 2 star because of the Tablet PC issue.
3,budget price,Overall budget price for medium value. Inside edges of the tines are not finished like the other edges. You have to be diligent about getting them completely clean.
2,Luke in 1989....not his best era!,"In 1994 I bought this album and actually thought it was very cool for some time. But....times and musical tastes have changed for me, and today I find this album to be quite a bore. I admit that Lukes vocals and his guitarplaying is great as always and songs such as It looks like rain, Fall into velvet and the very poppy Lonely beat of my heart are very good listenable songs. But apart from the fact that I find many of the songs to be very uninspiring, the sound is just plain annoying. Man, the whole record seems ""drowned"" in reverb, and furthermore, Lukes guitar is terribly overeffected, which he himself also admitted through some interviews in the 90es.If you feel the same way I do, I highly recommend spending your money on his 1997-album ""Luke"", which has great, raw, fantastic sound, honest lyrics and wonderful harmonies and vocals!!!"
3,"Been there, heard that","I bought this CD because my guitar teacher suggested listening to TOTO. I liked ""With a second chance"" for the groove and the ""Fall into Velvet"" for moments like the growly, brooding feel of the prelude. Don't know if any of these songs made Top40, but IMHO Second Chance could have been a contender.Overall impression: a fine example of bombastic rock, great chops but little originality."
4,"A very good cd, but needed more.","Any Toto fan will appreciate this cd. I love the style he shows in playing the guitar. I just thought that it was a bit rough and needed to be toned down a bit. Every ballad sung by Luke is always a winner to me. This cd was no exception. I would recomend this cd to any music fan since I am a fan of Lukather. I wish he would put out more cds since the fans deserve the best and in my book, he's the best. Also, amazon did what other record stores couldn't do(which was get me this cd and at a very, very reasonable price). I will and have recommended amazon to my friends."
4,Good for little kids,I watched Smurfs way back and it is still good for the little ones. The only problems with the DVD are the corny intro instead of the one I remember from way back and the fact that there should have been more shows on the DVDs for the price. (We are talking about a tv show that aired more that 20 years ago after all.)
3,Meh.,My 4 year old gtanddaughter loved the Smurf movie and I thought it was cute also. Then I bought this cartoon. Ick. Now I remember why I never really enjoyed the Smurfs when my son was a child. We didn't even finish watching. Bleh.
5,Smurfs Vol 1 review,Movie was great. Kid friendly as expected. No complaints here. Saved it on my Roku streamer. Movie is not HD.
5,It's Finally here!,"The Smurfs - Season One, Vol. OneI can't believe it's finally here! I've been a fan since I was a kid and am also a person who doesn't buy alot of DVDs - but the one thing I've been waiting for is the Smurfs on DVD! I must say the packaging is boring and I think they could have done better for this long awaited release. Hoping this first DVD is a success so they can do more for the dedicated Smurfs fans like me who want something even more special to hang on to and watch over and over.Looking forward to season 2!"
4,2 Box Sets???,"I have been waiting for eons for the Smurfs to come out on DVD! In my research, I found that this cartoon was in Dutch. Imaging my surprise when it came out in box set in September! Yes September! I purchased the box set on Amazon that is now showing unavailable........and it had six full discs of numerous episodes....so what's the difference between that one and this one with 2 disks?....Well I'm Smurfing all I can get before it disappears again! BUY BUY BUY!!! :)"
3,Not in spanish,"They already changed the languages settings, but when I bought this from amazon I did it because they said: ""spanish"", now I have a little nephew who does not speak english and a DVD that will not be seen, I usually don't buy anything online but amazon never dissapointed me before, I know this things happens but I expect this to never happen again.Good quality on the product, with extra features and good sound. English speakers kids will love it."
1,Highway Robbery,"I did the math. Every 3 episodes is one hour, that makes 2 half-hoursfor every three episodes. That makes 19 episodes six hours long, 12half-hour episodes. Even if you count the Springtime special that wouldmake it about 13 half-hour episodes for $19.99. That makes it $1.50 ahalf-hour episode. With Volumes sets we get cheated. Other shows likethe Partridge Family: Season 4 there are 22 half-hour episodes for$19.99, around .91 cents per half-hour. For a whole season of thepartridge family we get 9 episodes more for the same price as thisvolume set. This volume set of the Smurfs is not worth the price. I amgoing to wait until the price goes down to $13.99 or less."
4,Thought provoking and movin,"I must admit that I had never thought what happened after the second world war had ended, especially in Germany. This book made me realise that there were also German victims. Beautifully written with wonderful characters, this book had a big impact on me."
5,Interesting stories of ordinary Germans,"A great collection of three novellas set in Germany; the first two take place during or immediately after the war, and the third involves a man learning about his family's ties to the war, particularly that of his grandfather. What I like best about these stories is that they are each unique and don't fall into the trap of the typical stories about WWII or the holocaust, nothing is clear, just as life and the actions you take might not be clear to an outsider. The second story, focused on a teenager and her siblings' trek to find relatives in the destroyed Germany is probably the best of the three.It's been a while since I read this, but I plan on looking for anything new by this writer."
4,The endurance of the human spirit is universal,"When a friend recommended this book to me she said it was a page-turner but not enjoyable. I must say I found this to be an accurate assessment of a beautifully written but ultimately disturbing book about Nazi Germany. It has a deceptively simple style and its starkness is wholly appropriate to the subject material. The book is in three distinct parts. The middle section is a harrowing read which I found profoundly moving. The vivid images haunted me long after I had finished this book and I commend it to anyone interested in the ravages of war from `the other side'. Pain, degradation, misery, shame, outrage, cruelty, courage - all these are universal. And universal is the endurance of the human spirit with its capacity for transcending all adversity."
4,Lots of Fun,"This is a fun game and with the multi-player action, even the parents can join in or the siblings. My son spends hours playing this by himself and it really stimulates his imagination."
5,great show gotta watch it,"avatar is a fun and exciting show for all ages to watch. i have a six year old son for which i purchased it, but me and my seventeen year old son enjoyed it just as much as he did. we have watched all three seasons. a must see!!!"
5,Can't wait for Book 3!,"I just finished watching the collection of Book 2 and cannot wait for the next volume. My family and I enjoy this show tremendously. I recommend this series for anyone who like adventure epics. We tell everyone to watch this show! The action, characters, animation, and story-telling are better than anything else out there."
4,Good for kids,"My 14 year old son really likes this. I can't get into it, but its not geared at the 30s crowd."
5,Perfect!,"I bought, a while back, Book 1 & 3 at my local walmart. Then, and ever since then, I have never seen them carry a Book 2 or have one in stock. But of course, I wanted to complete my collection, and own the full of one of my favorite childhood series. So I turned to amazon. And my experience has been wonderful - it arrived exactly the day it said it would, in perfect condition. I'm watching the first disk now & so far it plays perfectly. :) Thank you!!"
5,Great Deal,Item was as described. Price offered on Amazon was way cheaper than buying it at the store or at Bestbuy.
5,Best DVD of the year!,I've been unable to put this DVD down. I strongly believe Avatar the last airbender to be one of the best shows right now on TV. Period. And this DVD collection has given me the chance to see every program over and over again. I highly recomend it. And it comes with a spanish track.
5,Show,I have no regrets buying this Book (show). It is absolutely phenomenal i recommend it to anyone who consider buying this
5,"""the kid who bends air without any hair""",great story. great characters. fun animation. good for kids and adults.what's not to like?
5,love the series since it started,"loved the series since it started, im 14 and my friends and i love it to be honest, it gets a bit cheesy in the beginning/middle of the third book but it's still amazing!i proudly give it 5 stars!"
5,Excellent Extras,"Along with the continuing story from season one, the stories do improve along with the animation quality as the series goes on. The extras definitely make it worth purchasing the dvds. I especially enjoyed the 3 Chibi episodes-very funny and cute."
2,"Brilliant show, terrible quality","I love this show and I was hooked on the 1st season when it was broadcast on a local channel. I missed the 2nd season showing and decided to support the creators by getting the DVD set. Until the DVD was delivered, I decided to download some illegal copies and watch them (its not like I haven't payed for a copy to watch).I really enjoyed watching the show - until I got the DVD box set: The video quality in the DVD set is simply HORRIBLE! the image is highly pixelated and looks like a bad computer screen. Both the broadcast quality and the TV rips I downloaded were much better quality. The encoding is so bad that it is painful to watch!Goal 1: support to creators - Achieved!Goal 2: enjoy high quality legal video - Failed!!"
3,"Great content, aweful features","The legend of Avatar continues in Season 2. However, the features on DVD are poorly thought out. Half the episodes had commentaries, BUT, it has no subtitles!WHY? when you listen to the commentary, you can't follow the dialog at all! You lose half the context of the story."
5,AWESOME!!!,My four year old grandson watches it everyday!!! HE loves it! Now we have to compete to watch something on the TV
5,Great for all ages,"THis is a great story that teaches a lesson in life in every episode. My husband, 9, 7 and 3 year old son sit spell bound thru the whole show."
5,The whole family is hooked,"This is a fantastic show. I'm 37 and have two kids. I introduced it to them and they are obsessed with it. My wife, who doesn't watch cartoons, got hooked too. It is an entertaining, at times visually stunning, and a very thoughtful (intelligent) story. The development of the characters as well as the emotional attachment to them rivals anything on television - that goes for shows with live actors too."
2,Uninteresting and doesn't cover much for the topic.,I don't see the point. There's not a lot that can be used or applied. Just reading generalizations and not offering anything near the amount of knowledge and usefulness as a book dedicated to this topic should.
2,Protocols only,I was/am looking for a book on IP Routing. I can tell you this book is NOT for the beginner. It has no description on how IP addresses work or how subnets work. All it does is talk about the different protocols. This might be helpful once the reader understands the basics but not until then.
3,"Good, but needs better editing","The book seems good, however the errata really needs to be downloaded and applied to the text.Some errors start on page 4 and the first two chapters need to be rechecked carefully.Otherwise the books is good, clearly worded and explained, enjoyable and easy to read.Check the errata on the publisher page before you attempt to read the book, or confusion will be great !---------"
4,For CCNA,"This book is perfect supplement of CCNA IP routing part. The official book maybe deep for some people. The first time I fail to understand this book , it requires immediate CCNA knowledge. After watching CCNA video training, I find this book is easy to absorb, the Oreilly writting style. I like ths book because it shows straightly how to enable RIP, EIGRP and OSPF routing commands with full examples. I also got the Routing first step from Cisco Press compare with this book , I vote this rather than the Ciso press book. Although like other comment says it has errors, but it doesn't hurt the clear logic and main body.I recommand this book for immediate CCNA level readers, it clear many ideas apart from Official CCNA study guide."
1,Too many errors making this book not worth buying.,"This books has more than two hundred of errors (I did not count them, but you can print out the errata (about 13 pages) at o'reilley site), some quite serious.It shows that this book is careless reviewed and prepared. Buy other books instead of this one since it is also outdated."
1,Too many errors !,"This should be a 5 animal O'Reilly book. Unfortunately, there are too many typos or errors in the book. A router newbie would be thoroughly lost with the examples. Interfaces are incorrectly labeled in diagrams, networks mislabeled, etc. If you have a good networking background already, you can probably wade through the book. It does a fair job of explaining how the different routing protocols are implemented on Cisco routers. Shame on O'Reilly for releasing this book - and you think Windoze crashes too much ??!!"
1,A Sad Attempt,This book was a sad attempt at discrediting Christianity and their beliefs. This appears to be written by a nonbeliever who takes many things out of context and turns them around for his own benefit. Don't waste your money.
4,still growing,"This book excels at providing an integrated and comprehensive look at the global population. Studying many trends that have brought us [the world] to the current state of affairs. Like the lowering of fertility across the developed countries. Such that many are now below replacement rates, signalling a future dimunition of population unless immigration is increased. There are explanations of various models of correlations between demographic and population growth. Though many of these are untested and somewhat empirical.The text also looks at poor countries. Where the situation is often starkly different. While fertility rates have often fallen, these are usually still above replacement rates. Leading some countries to expect continued demographic pressures to maintain, let alone improve, living standards.Unfortunately, the best available data suggests that the world population will still increase, topping out [we hope] at 9 billion by 2050. It could be grim."
1,Some fog and smoke.,"Can't quite admit to themselves about the genocide of the natives of the Americas. They should read, e.g., Ward Churchill and revise accordingly."
5,A New Affection For Sharks,"Clever, insightful, and fun to boot -- Sherman's Lagoon includes a fun cast of characters and a subtle social commentary. At first sight, Sherman's Lagoon may seem no more than an aquatic Garfield, but from Fillmore's dating troubles to the recent cheez whiz spill in the lagoon, there is more than meets the eye! I don't read comic strips often, but I always remember to flip to Sherman's Lagoon. Thanks, Jim Toomey! I only hope Sherman is swimming around somewhere here in the Pacific Northwest."
5,Blood in the Water,While it is nice to see a book that is not all nice - where shark meets human beach ape. Where else would you read that a shark would not want to eat a person because she is a Redhead and he is allergic to redheads. Will buy the next book.
3,Distant Lover,"Tandi Crawford has it all, a good husband, a well mannered son, two great female friends, house, job - she's living every woman's dream - or is she? Mallette takes us on a road that has already been traveled in the world of Black fiction. The twists and turns of Tandi's life weren't anything new, in fact, I figured out where this story was going after the first couple of chapters. The story was well-written but really lacked the spice and fire of The Honey Well and Shades of Jade. 2.5 stars - get it from the library."
1,"Essential, My Foot","Be sure to read the very fine print on the back of this one before wasting your money. The first disc, the one with all of Denver's hits, doesn't have the original recordings on it. No, it's another one of those pitiful later rerecordings he did, in the mid '90s. Horrible.I've learned to stay away from anything with ""Medacy"" on the label. But even that name is so tiny that it's hardly noticeable. Buyer beware. You may think you're getting a deal on this 2-disc package, but nearly all of it is garbage on disc 1, and mostly forgetable junk on the disc 2, with the exception of ""Calypso."""
2,warning 3- not original,"I got this CD at a used record store, not realizing they weren't the original recordings. Very disappointing. He sounds like a tired middle-aged man trying to hold on to his glory days. His voice didn't hit the high notes very well on this recording, and in those parts it sounds gravelly. The originals were much better, even on my crappy computer speakers - John sounded happier and full of energy. I will get the original greatest hits vol 1&2 and hope to get rid of this one."
3,barney draw n giggle,"this toy is kinda on the small side, more like a travel version. it was kinda pricey to be small but probably would have bought it anyway, other than that my grandaughter enjoys it...would recomend it for smaller children..."
1,I lost 98 min of my life,"The movie cannibal man is not like it says. First off, he isnt a cannibal at all. As a lover of cannibal films this is far from one. Even the description on the back is misleading. He works at a meat plant where he makes soup, wow how convenient on disposing of bodies. He does kill some people, but the scenes where people die arent that graphic so that wasnt worth my time and my friends who were there with me watching it. What is with his neighbor, the homosexual inuendos were there, and well really upfront and unnecessary. I do not recommend this film to anyone that likes cannibal films, or horror films. It sucked"
4,Nice fitting and comfortable,This fit nicely and for me is very comfortable to wear. It is sized properly and did not shrink with washing and drying.
4,Robin Auld live at my Wedding,"We have recently returned from a wedding in Cape Town, actually ours,where we had the privelege of Robin Auld singing a couple of live tunes for us, and oh boy was he the catalyst of the entertainment or what!He is the South African version of Jimmy Buffett, so get the album chinas!!"
5,Masterpiece,"Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor spent two years crafting one of the most richly layered rock albums ever made, the 1999 double-CD The Fragile. He blended instruments and sounds in previously untested combinations: using cardboard boxes and bicycle chains as a drum kit, tinkering detuned mandolins and rusted synthesizers to conjure new sounds, and subverting even traditional instruments such as guitars and pianos until they sounded like alien intruders. NIN previous album, 1994's The Downward Spiral, turned into one of the last decade's defining works on it's way to more then 4 million in sales, The Fragile has already sunk off the Billboard 200 after debuting at No. 1 last fall. The commercial setback has not gone unnoticed by Reznor, who, in a recent interview , discussed the state of a pop culture that clearly prefers Kid Rock and Britney Spears to his more emotionally complex brand of music."
4,Much Different,"Initially, when I first got this album, I was immediately disgusted with it. One absolutely cannot compare this to Pretty Hate Machine. They are totally different. Pretty Hate Machine is more heavy metal where as this cd seems to have a more industrial feel to it. I like this album now because it is different, the reason I didn't like it before. If you want a good heavy metal album, don't dive for this like I did. This album is good for rather ambient background music having so many instrumentals. I chose to write this review for people who may do what I did, buy this cd based on songs like Closer and Head Like a Hole. Basically, make sure you hear a lot of this cd or are a huge fan of NIN before you purchase it."
3,"""It didn't turn out the way you wanted it too...""","First of all, I just wanna get one thing straight for the people that don't really know what direction is headed for the anger of Nine Inch Nails...If you especially liked ""Into The Void"", you'll wanna hear ""Pretty Hate Machine"", with it's very even and progressive beats and it's catcy choruses practically making you sing along. ""The Fragile"" would probably be reccomended for fans only. Nine Inch Nails are capable of making the best of music, but when it comes to that, this album is just comes nowhere near. This is Nine Inch Nails when when held back from doing what Nine Inch Nails wants to do."
3,The Fragile,"It was ok, again not his best work, 1 or 2 song are good, the rest seemed like fillers..sorry Trent..."
1,Sorry Trent - this is a big disappointment,"I have loved everything NIN has put out since day one, but after listening to The Fragile I was very disappointed. He seems to have run out of the awesome songs that were on his previous releases. The songs are cheesy and unimaginative. Releasing a double album is always great when there are lots of good songs, but most of this seems like filler material...Better luck next time I guess."
2,Depressing and self important,"This is perhaps the most emotionally monochromatic collection of pop songs I have ever heard. This is really just bad 70s Art Rock with explicit lyrical content. If this album sells because people really feel this way about life, then I feel sorry for them. Probably the worst thing in the world for someone in that state however, would be to listen to this ""masterpiece."" I have no interest in anything Trent Reznor has to say. Further, he isn't terribly clever or even musically expressive in the way he says it. The 2 stars in my rating are due to the fact that occasionally the album is sonically interesting, but aside from that, spend your precious listening time on something emotionally and musically honest. This is contrived drivel."
1,SIGH....,"(All spoken very calmly)No no no boys and girls. Do not be misled. Mr. Reznor and all the pretty people would love for you to swoon and think to yourselves ""Trent Reznor is a brilliant genious. Trent Reznor is so very cool. Trent Reznor is so deep. Who can compare...?"" Listen, they said the same thing about Bob Dylan and he never wrote a single note of valuable music...just ...).Trent Reznor is no musical genious. Trent Reznor is a pampered, wealthy ... who has you by the ... every time you spend money on his arrogant, self absorbed tripe. He is no genious. He is no visionary. He is a basher and no more. This is folly at it's grandest. There is nothing of value here. He is laughing all the way to the bank selling you this ... (In case you are smirking, no, I didn't buy it, I reviewed a copy that belonged to someone else).Enjoy your fog and haze oh lost ones."
1,I really wanted this cd to be good. I really did.,"Wow, all those five star reviews. I just don't get it. After loving EVERYthing NIN has put out until now, this cd all sounds like one long miserable, droning song to me. I just don't see the facination. I really wanted this to be the return of good old rock in the era of boy bands & Britney Spears, but this isn't the return of anything. Sorry, Trent."
1,trent rez is far overrated,this album goes nowhere for me.it sounds like a bad outtake of depache mode on acid.to often then not trent thinks he is being innovative with board sounds and what not but it becomes noise and really loud.the words don't hit either.at best he is a hit&miss artist but not a trailblazer.
1,The Fragile Junk,"NIN started out great with their debut Pretty Hate Machine then later created a great album named The Downward Spiral. However, after disappearing from the rock scene for several years, Trent popped out of his grave and distributed a new album, just in time for Christmas, named The Fragile. The album should have been called The Junk. Every song is non-creative and has a clearance-marked Radio Shack keyboard sound. Bad follow-up to The Downward Spiral. Trent: Go back to your grave and save people their cash."
1,"Define melodramatic, adolescent pretentiousness","Answer: Nine Inch Nails. Maybe if Trent Reznor had seen a good therapist as a child, the world would be spared from all this dreadful drivel. NIN on the left of me, Britney on the right of me... God I'm surrounded by evil. :)"
2,Disappointing,"I expected something original, brilliant, and with even more more dark moodiness than his previous albums. But ""disappointing"" would be the single word to descbribe my reaction after enduring the 120 minutes of The Fragile... The lyrics are so repetative, never quite inflicting any great degree of emotion, and the vocals are dry, unimpassioned, and lacking in melody. There are a few-earcatching songs, (Especially ""Somewhat Damaged"" and ""We're in this Together""), but the rest just aren't very impressive."
2,Same old . . .,"Sorry NIN faithful, but Trent doesn't pull through on this one. One of the greatest things about Reznor was always his originality and innovation ('The Downward Spiral' being, in my opinion, one of the greatest, and definitely the most artistic and original, album of the '90's). Don't get me wrong- this album IS good, however, when put up against his other groundbreaking work, there's just nothing NEW here. The guitar is exceptional, the lyrics, as always, whiny, overdramatic and dull. I've always liked NIN's noise-rock, and, even better, when he layered it over dance hooks (check out the 'Fixed' EP), but what we have here only seems like throw-away tracks from 'The Downward Spiral': aggressive, loud, explosive, but just not as catchy (with a couple exceptions: Starfuckers, Inc., Into the Void, We're in this together). 'The Downward Spiral' remains his 'masterpiece'; do yourself a favor and listen to it instead."
4,NIN,"As someone who's not remotely interested in today's radio pop, I treat this CD like ear candy, or comfort food. It's fun, beautiful in places and perfectly produced. (I somehow enjoy the lyrics even when they're dumb). I love the flow of the first six tracks. If they could have sustained that momentum for the whole album (even making it a single one) it would have been great. But if this were a single CD it just wouldn't be ""The Fragile"". You can of course skip the tracks you don't like and leave them to be discovered in the far future. You can find this CD used anywhere (esp. this site), so it costs about the same as one disc anyway. Enjoy!"
5,Worth the wait,"From what I've heard on the single (The Day the World Went Away) and the live performance on the MTV Awards, this album is really going to live up to the fans' expectations. I can't wait to get my hands on it..."
4,Dropping a 4 in this ocean of 5-stars,"Much better. Now I know this CD is true. Been an admirer since prehistoric Pretty Hate Machine. Guess I'm not a fan because I paid more attention to abnormal fan behavior while working Event Staff at 3 NIN concerts- I recommend the experience. But buy this CD first so you know which song will trigger the 15,000 hormones in front of you. (Message to Trent- Saw you at a bar on Cromwell St., London in Spring 1994. Didn't say hi though- you looked pretty f'n tired, man ...later)"
5,Title is decieving,"The title of the album is frigle and the songs on the two disks are anything but that. With songs like ""We're in this together"" and ""Starf**kers Inc."" it is no wonder that Rolling Stones magazine voted this album best of 1999."
4,not for a new NIN fan...,"I just bought ""The Fragile"" today, and I must say, that it is not as good as The Downward Spiral and Broken put together.. but, it is pretty good and I like it. However, I do not recommend this album for a new NIN fan... I think you have to have some background knowledge on Trent Reznor before you buy The Fragile.. start out with Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, or The Downward Spiral and get the feel of Trent's music first.. Anywho=\ overall, this is a great piece of work, but I still like the older stuff better.. but, who knows..... maybe after I listen to it a few more times, my thoughts could change..."
5,best album for reznor to date,this album shows the diversity of the musical geniuses behind nine inch nails. it ties together all the loose ends of the other discs into one greatly satisfying collection. it shows what trent has been up to all these years
4,new and unusual musical influences prevail in the fragile.,"I, like every other NIN fan waited anxiously for the fragile and i must say, i am not disappointed although i expected something different. The musical influences that drift through this music speak of japanese and indonesian rhythms with complex and compelling melodies. The same sad story for trent. Makes me wonder if these musings are by a happy man who has found a marketing nitch or if he's genuinely in despair. I miss the sexual inuendo of Downward spiral, but the moodiness and the way he uses those huge crescendos to follow sweet and cthonic passages that blow your heart open are again so satisfying. The fragile is a cd to live in as was TDS. Thank you Trent for another expanding collection."
5,"Ferocious, but Fragile","First of all let me say that anyone who thinks they're a nine inch nails fan because they heard ""closer"" on the radio and want to buy the new cd, get aquainted with Nine Inch Nails first. What Trent Reznor is best at is creating a strange and unusual world for his listeners with every album he creates. And he accomplishes that with ""The Fragile."" The album opens with the ferocious ""Somewhat Damaged"" and moves across the plains of Trent Reznor's world with songs like ""We're in this togrether"" screaming attention, while songs like ""The Great Below"" are almost dream-like in their beauty. As a Nine Inch Nails fan knows, every album sounds different and has its own feel about it, so trying to assume what this album would sound like would be damn near impossible. Anyone who is a fan only of ""The Downward Spiral"" may not like this new album very much, but for long time fans or new discoverers of Trent's ten year career, ""The Fragile"" is a must have."
2,.,"As a productional feat, The Fragile is intoxicating and inspiring. There is still a lot of imagination in these tracks, even if it seems less strikingly original now than it did on earlier releases. These things are worth something. But I am a part of the circle who was hoping for something really different with this release, as Trent promised, and as the output of his Nothing label implicitly suggested. Not that this isn't different from past material in ways, but Trent's moping has never been more irritating, and his lyrics have never been more like bad highschool goth poetry. On ""Broken,"" for all its melodrama, the anger at least felt like anger; on The Fragile, the anger is vapid, paper-thin, and generally awkward in context; silly tracks like Starfckrs Inc. are absolutely uncondonable. It's just so pretentious and goofy and empty. I listen to these discs simply for the gorgeousness and originality of the production, and I often wish that all of the tracks were instrumentals."
5,The best from the best,"This is hands-down trent's best work. Its infectious and tedious, catchy and dreary, and well...just about perfect. Great pacing, great song structure, and Trent's overall musical boldness make this double-LP an EXPERIENCE.Don't pass this album up."
5,FRAGILISTIC!,"One of NIN's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
4,"4,5 stars Amazing album",I really like this album very much. Its full of songs (2 cds) and most tracks are very good. I love the production - is really excellent and the industrial loops sound really <<full>>.If you dont know Nine inch nails this is a good album to start with. One of their best albums .
5,One of the greatest albums ever,"The fragile by NIN, the most anticipated album of the year has to be one of the greatest albums ever made. The genius of Trent Reznor is unquantifiable just as his music is impossible to categorize. Savage, but beautiful - Raging tantrums and frustrations to tranquil, almost jazz like moments, the whole record is completely wonderful. All of his work so far has been outstanding, no more evidence needed than The Downward Spiral, but The Fragile is Trent Reznor's masterpiece, sure to influence just about every new generation of artists. Reznor is back, and this time believe the hype. Mindblowing."
5,Right up there with Broken,"The Fragile is an incredibly good CD. I feel that it is better than The Downward Spiral. It just seems more complete, more meaningful. I'd put it right up there with Broken."
3,not as depressing and hateful,"but actually i liked the depressing hateful part of nin. trent always could do that, but now he sings about not hateful things. i dont like it as much. but its still nin, so i like it :)"
4,The Fragile,"it's been almost 6 years, but it was worth the wait. the first disc is pure genius. the second disc is good....but not as genius. buy it now."
4,The Four Stars are for the Music ONLY,"Once again NIN, Inc. create unique sound textures and soundscapes. Once again, the lyrics are twenty-fifth rate school boy ramblings about how his life is ruined by other people(a tired, repetitve theme througout his ""career""). Also the formula of angry vocals over loud, overdriven guitars went out with Cobain's suicide. Instrumentally excellent, lyrically and vocally achieving a new level for mediocrity. Overall, a waste of silence."
3,Difficult,"I'm really shocked about this album: I had never listen to a NIN CD before. It is not simple music, and it has many things to be read between its lines. Perhaps I prefer some other sort of music, and that's why I don't rate it too well, but I must realize it sounds thrilling. It has something really weird and special."
2,very disappointing,"I've been a Nine Inch Nails fan for years, and I was really excited to finally listen to this album, since it is their first material out in a long time. Well.... maybe I've grown out of them, but I really didn't like this album. Very generic Nine Inch Nails, very uncreative, kind of dumb lyrics... overall, I wish I could get my money back. Maybe it grows on you... I don't know. But initially, I can't even stand to listen to it."
4,This is what makes music art.,"Ok, I have never been a big fan, some songs here and there were cool, ect. But I have never heard anything like this, it is rare. All the thought and emotion that went into making this album comes out in every note. There arent too many albums where you actually ""feel"" the songs. Hell, even the songs i dont like , i can feel and still appreciate them. So go out and by something rare, give it a chance and really listen to it, you wont be able to stop. The wretched is an amazing song, if this is released as a single, watch out!"
5,The Fragile-A must have,"Nine inch nails have outdone themselves with this release. Trent Reznor has proved himself one of the greatest artist of the decade. With The Fragile, The day the world went away, We're in this together and No, you don't, he displays his song writing abilities to the max. And also great instrumentals such as Pilgramage and Just like you imagened. And that's just the first CD. 23 songs in all, and i'm impressed with them all. A MUST BUY!!!"
5,"Take this aural journey, you will not regret it.","My taste in music is (to say the least) diverse. This is the most captivating and addictive album I have listened to since I first heard Pink Floyd's The Wall. Like the wall, you have to listen to the whole thing. Then do it again. You can not ignore what Trent has done with The Fragile. I love the ""acoustic"" touches."
4,"took a while, but i like what i hear","This CD will grow on you. When I first listened to it, it sounded like one really long song that lasted for 2 disks. I guess that's cool, but the more I listened, the more different they became. They still, mostly, start out slow and calm, build to something like a massive rage, and then fade out to complacency. Kind of a merging between Broken and Further Down the Spiral. I wish some of the songs were a little faster. Also wish that the rumors were true about the merging of Drum N'Bass and Jungle music into this album. Oh well, maybe in another 5 years. Regardless, it's a great CD, but I'm sure every NIN fan has it by now."
4,I'm giving it four stars for the first 7 tracks alone.,"The Left disc(the first) of this double CD set is nearly a perfect album in itself. What I didn't like though was that the Right(the second) disc had too much filler. Nevertheless it is Trent Reznor at his finest for the first half of the album and for that reason alone it is definitely worth pickin' up. Definitely for fans of ""The Downward Spiral"" it's just a shame this album didn't get the recognition it deserved at the time of it's release and at the same time ...Limp Bizkit was riding high (sigh). Obviously for NIN fans and if you like Tool(who I really dig) and Marilyn Manson(who I don't really like at all) then it's mandatory to make this one a purchase."
4,Nuttin' like new NIN,"Many have already said that downward spiral or pretty hate was trent's best, but I disagree. Granted, his past works were jaggedly delightful, but his new stuff is evolutionary. Evolutionary in the sense that he's moving on in his life, and with it, the transformation of his thoughts with his music. Fragile almost seems too soft at times, but I believe it a great mix of harsh versus sweet melody. Ol' trent is simmering down, his mind probably aging along with his body. But, he's NIN, and he needs to keep us salivating with more of the original Industrial. Another great work from reznor-mon."
4,Guess what you don't know?,Hey this CD Is even Better if you Play Both discs at the Same time...I found this out from experience I had from another Techno CD set we had at the radio station.
5,Two words - A Masterpiece,"I walked over a mile at nearly midnight to buy this cd the day it was released. I would walk ten times that knowing now as I do how wonderful the Fragile is. ""Somewhat Damaged"", the first track on disc one, is full of anger and rage and a masterfully arranged song. ""The Great Below"" is astonishing in its beauty, both in its lyrics and its sound. I could keep going, but since I LOVE every song on both discs, I would be here for a while. I highly recommend this, even for first time NIN listeners."
5,Musical Journey,"There is nothing better then some damn good music and The Fragile is just that.This is an album that needs to be heard in one sitting cause each song flows so beautifuly with the next this is something I believe that only Reznor can or do it as good as he can.Another thing that is so orginal on this album is I usually hate instumental songs. I really don't mind an opener but I usually consider them album fillers.But this is not so, on The Fragile the instrumental songs are some of the best on the album and so powerful that they need no words.I'm not some depressed person or whatever that people tend to assiocate people who listen to NIN with and of course the majority isn't like that at all.This album is more then an album this is art."
3,<sigh>,"this guy again? i won't complain about it. all i'll say is that if you think this is good stuff, do yourself and everyone you know a favor and go check out MFDMK's self-titled debut album. unless you're depressed, you'll forget all about this guy...i have. The Fragile is, to me at least, a lot more forgettable than tDS and Broken...and Broken's the only one that was really good. but that's just my opinion, and since you're here, yours must be different. THE FUTURE MUST NOT BELONG TO THE MEDIOCRE! snoochie boochies hahaPS - i gave this 3 stars to try and remain as neutral as possible on it"
5,The prog-rock concept album LIVES!!!,"Those who are expecting an album of obvious singles like 'Pretty Hate Machine' will be disappointed. Though the individual songs are given more room to breathe than 'The Downward Spiral', they still remind one of the noodlings of those German art-rock bands like Can and Faust from the 70's. They seem to make more sense in the context of the album. That is a good thing, given the current state of music. Trent has essentially knocked himself off of the playlists of the ""Alternative Rock"" stations, proving that 'alternative' still exists."
3,i wish...,"GOD DAMN! I want to be able to tell you that Trent has done it again. I'd love to be able to say ""Wow, this is a GREAT album""....but it's not. Next to ""Downward Spiral"" this is a 3 star album. It sounds like it should have been released between ""Preatty Hate Machine"" and ""Broken"" or maybe ""Broken"" and ""Downward Spiral""."
1,THis blows,"Trent Reznor wants to be Kurt Cobain so bad. The songs on this album are too repetitive. If u want to hear REAL music, listen to Nirvana, Metallica, or AC/DC."
1,Even one star is pushing it...,"I can't in good conscience recommend this album to anybody--it's complete and utter garbage, but then again, I expect nothing less from Trent. For my money, he'll never be able to top 'Broken', and 'Fragile's excessive length doesn't redeem anything. Expect to find lots of copies of this album in the used bins in no time."
2,I was rather disappointed.,"I was once a hardcore NIN fan, and then I had to wait years for some new songs. Then one day, a friend of mine showed me the day the whole world went away single. I had not known about it, I do not listen to the radio, and no longer watch MTV. I was pretty saisfied with it. So I thought The Fragile would be really good. I was wrong. A lot of the songs are boring and repetitive in a Ministry-like way. I did in enjoy a few of the songs, but overall, its quite a disappointment. Pretty Hate Machine gives you beautiful electronic music. Broken gives you some really loud guitar filled songs. And The Downward Spiral is just amazing. The Fragile gives you nothing. I feel Trent Reznor has lost it. And I noticed he had some help from Dr. Dre on The Fragile, too. It is sad his good talents will be wasted with Dr. Dre. But, all good things come to an end. It was nice listening to you Trent, now go sellout and enjoy yourself."
1,the hopelessly redundant,"This is the worst CD purchase i've ever made. I tried unsuccessfully to convince myself that i liked it - the fragile is essentially really bad high school poetry played to a repetitive techno backbeat. I'm sure this tediously long album will show up in used CD bins for years to come.This is 30 Bucks and 4.6 hours of my life i will never get back (yeah, i listened to it twice just to make sure it wasn't my imagination... it really was horrible). Thank you Trent."
3,Trent needs to bow down and thank Bowie,"If it wasn't for Bowie, Reznor never would have amounted to a thing. Bowie's haunted presence is all over the exploits of The Fragile."
3,Unimpressive,Not impressed. The music world is in a rut and so are you Trent Reznor. Has its moments though.
2,doesn't blow me away,"This record left me pretty disappointed. For a double album, the range of textures and tempos is amazingly flat. There's no ""Big Man with a Gun,"" no ""March of the Pigs,"" no ""Head Like a Hole."" Nothing that really rocks loud. Even after a dozen listens, the only impression I get is that this is a sluggish record. I wouldn't rush out to buy this record if you haven't yet."
4,Good-But Long,"Let me start by saying that this is a good CD. Don't get me wrong I like the CD and it is probably NIN's best (better than ""the downward spiral"" definately). But, it is a little bit too long. Navigating throught this two disc collection is usually a good experience, except there are some very inconsistent parts. I fell asleep listening to both CD's in a row. Still, I would recommend the CD, although it is long and inconsistent at times."
4,How I feel about NiN,I think this band is awesome because they have always released some good music and different music. Their label also carries some good bands that are out there now. You can't compare NiN to anyone else because they are unlike any band out there. They will always have a different sound and always be an awesome band.
5,worth the wait,"I don't know why Trent Reznor can never seem to get happy, but it's good to be angry again. This album isn't quite as awesome as Broken but it definitely betters The Downward Spiral. It may not have a ""Closer""-esque single-worthy dance number, yet it certainly does pack a punch as a whole. Very inventive sounds, not at all redundant. Into the Void is a huge highlight. Not for the fragile, but not just for long-term, hardcore fans, either."
5,Amazing,"This beautiful collection of lush melodies, noise, and grating industrial dance beats makes an incredible opus. Not once did my attention divert from my stereo. It is one of the best albums I have listened to, and has fulfilled the 5 year wait we've all had. Buy it, and buy it NOW."
5,"""Where were you?""","WoW, i must admit, i have been dreaming of this cd for 5 yrs. and since the last year it's been scaring me... will this nin fan like this cd? i mean trent kept saying he is trying something new. so in my mind it was... it will be good or it will be bad..... problem solved. AMAZING!! right from the start... to the very end... like any other cd, you must listen to it over and over.... catch what you missed. i mean first time i listened to downward spiral i only liked a few songs... few days later i had them all pounding in my head.... i've only had the fragile for one day and i have them all pounding in my head. plus i've never been a big fan of songs with out lyrics. (though i liked 'a warm place') i still like lyrics. but on this cd.... 'just like you imagined' and 'pilgrimage' ... OH MY GOD!!!!! WOW.... if you read this... GO BUY THIS CD>>> YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!~!!!!"
5,After a 5 year wait the musical genius Trent Reznor is back.,"Knowing how to keep you on the edge of your seat, couch, or whatever you sit in, Trent Reznor has brought to us another ""5 star"" album! All of the songs have an awsome beat. From the begining to the end of these 23 tracks you will be taking a journey through the mind of Trent Reznor, and a fun journey it is! Tracks like 'We're In This Together', 'Somewhat Damaged', 'Pilgrimage', and 'Star@#$%ers Inc.' really know how to get you pumped. Then tracks like 'The Fragile', 'The Day The World Went Away', and 'La Mer' calm you back down. All-in-all this CD get a 11 out of 10, 3 thumbs up, and since i can't choose 6, it gets 5 stars."
5,Love It Hate IT Album,"There are many people who like this album then there are many who think it is Trent Reznor's worst work to date..........i think that is a mis-calculation i mean seriously you have to give Trent credit on songs like ""The Fragile"" ""The Great Below"" ""Somewhat Damaged"" and the very good ""Into The Void"".......if anything this is a step further than The Downward Spiral i can tell that he is much more mature in this album than The Downward Spiral it is less angry and more calmer even though it has its moments it also has many flashes of brilliance through-out the whole Double Album.....i am not one to like crappy bands such as ""three days grace"" ""linkin park"" trapt"" but i do like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin and i'd say if you like those bands then get this but then agian i was raised and grown up on NIN ne ways get this album it will grow on you it is very good musical masterpiece todays modern ""THE WALL"""
5,Trent continues to play with new syling and wins everytime,Simply put this is a great album and is worth every penny! I can listen to it over and over again and never get bored. I hope and pray that this is not the last album by NIN/Trent Reznor. Get this CD if you like NIN at all. You won't be sorry.
5,"One of the best ""concept"" records","Some of the reviewers have already said that the notion of concept albums seem to have lost their favour with the general public. Seems like people expect singles that are not connected in any way to the rest of the album. The result being only one or two ""good"" songs per album nowadays. Trent Reznor has a flair for delivering incredibly composed pieces that run the spectrum of human emotions and sounds. This album (much like the Downward Spiral) definitely has to be sampled in its entirety in order to appreciate the full effect of the music. The lyrics are amazing and the music is nothing short of incredible. Even in 2005, most popular artists are (sadly) not making anything this intricate, complex, beautiful and interesting. This record is definitely ahead of its time."
2,Not THAT great!,"Geez, kids! I can't believe 290+ people reviewed this cd..why not listen to something else? More of the same Nine inch nails gothic bravado"
5,Does it even matter?,"At close to 1,000 5-Star reviews, does it even matter what I say? Even if I were to talk about how much this album has meant to me over the years, I'm simply going with the flow on this one; as individualistic as this album is, my 5-Star review is simply one of the masses. I give up; Trent: thanks, man - this album helped me through some rough patches and stands strong as one of the best dual records of all time."
5,the best ever...,"i listened to this album one night with all the lights off and by the end of the first disk i was emotionally drained - this is the most amazing, intense album i have ever heard in my life. one disc just wouldn't be enough, two discs is the perfect length for this album and you need to sit down and LISTEN to the entire album to take it all in - and even then you'll need hundreds more listens to fully appreciate it.buy this cd!"
2,"He's lost his touch, will someone please piss him off again.","I was a BIG fan of NIN, until this one, now I'm just a fan. Take away all the anger and creative dissonance from Downward Spiral and you're left with something much like Fragile. These songs lack so much of the originality of previous work that I must ask, why not a triple album, these songs could've been written in a month."
5,The best album ever.......,After 5 years of waiting and a tempting new single the world was left to wait and see if the new album was worth the wait...... One word... absolutely...... Since his first album Trent has shown us what is possible with music and ever since he has continually made his fans happy.... his newest venture has once again proven that his music can only get better...... Fragile is a perfect example of what music should be.... if there is one album to complete your collection then Fragile would be it......
4,Cool Sounds,This CD is very innovative. Trent Reznor is a very talented artist and you don't get tired listening to this Cd because the songs are so different. I would recommend buying this CD if you like any songs from nine inch nails.
2,disappointing,"I expected much more when listening to this cd, especially after waiting so long for it's release. The songs are, unfortunately, neither groundbreaking or memorable."
3,"overpriced, overblown, pointless","Trent reached his peak going down the spiral. The fragile is Trent coasting down the hill. He has painstakingly recorded another ""nin"" record, repeating himself while the youthful angst has pretty much burned out. The Fragile pretty much mirrors Downward in style, but more tired and mature( in an old type of way). I think that Trent really wants to make a ""This Mortal Coil"" record but was scared to try anything outside of his established personae.Why the ""double album"", and the high price anyway?Don't bother buying this, just sit in your room in the dark and wait until you die, and save yourself 20 dollars."
2,should have made better,"the only song impressed me is ""we're in this together"",the rest is just ok,i still think ""the downward spiral"" (4 stars)is better."
5,A dark beautiful album,"I am a new NIN fan and enjoy this album more than any other album I have.It is broken, distorted,painful,and very depressing,the feel of the songs that is, and I meant that in a good way.This is the first album that you have to listen it all to understand. It is an epic masterpiece.An album so magnificant that it is actually hard to take all at once.It is a gem in the rough.Although some people don't like the song I think ""StarFu**ers"" is great but than you'll find at least five new favorite songs on this album.My only problem is that to undestand the second disc it has to be preceeded by the first,but actually that shows talent."
1,"Embarassing work, Trent.","Poor attempt at sounding artistic. He's lucky to have great machines that create sound effects, otherwise he'd be out of a job. And his voice, the only time it sounds good is when he distorts it to make it sound interesting, when really it has nothing to do with talent. The instrumentals on this album sound good, especially the piano snipets. But doesn't all piano music sound good and intriguing when looking at it in the right angle? He could be playing 3 Blind Mice on the piano and adding all these special effects to it and you all would love it and call it original music, especially when he throws in some violin sampled loop. All this album is, is mainstream music's attempt at sounding original. You people are reaching out to fill your artist void, I just hope you fill it in with something else. Maybe the Dixie Chicks really are a better alternative."
1,This album really blows!,For once NIN actually came out with something new and not re-mixed and it sucks. They randomly throw sounds out througha computer and they call it music?!? I have the other albums (all but broken and fixed) and they are ok -- aside from the remixes... I bought this one expecting it to be good... and it was a waste of money. You cant put garbage on a CD (double cd at that) and expect that just because your name is on it people will worship it.... this NIN can stay on the shelf IMHO...
5,Incredible,"I bought this the first release day and was admittedly worried... I mean after 5 years can Trent keep his talents up? YES!!! And even more so!!! This is definitely the best NIN cd ever, TDS can't come anywhere near this. More complex and mature than the other cd's. And if you're wondering if it's deep, just listen to ""The Great Below"" and get back to me. A classic, a masterpiece, all these things and more! What else can I say but ""Wow, this is incredible."" P.S. i've never seen so many 5 star reviews..."
2,Manson has Overtaken Reznor,"What a let-down. I waited five years for this? This is artistic progression? The sad thing (for Trent) is, how he knocks Manson (his protogee,)all over the place, but in the five years it took Trent to deliver this half cooked, overstuffed load Manson progressed from the underachieving ""Portrait"" to the watershed of ""Antichrist"" to one of the best albums of last year, ""Mechanical Animals"". In that time, I became a huge Manson fan, so the mediocrity of this album was a sad revelation. Once again, the student has surpassed the Master. Reminds me of ""Amadeus"": poor old Salieri, cursing Mozart because his talent casts a shadow on Salieri's Weakness. (No, I'm not comparing Manson to Mozart, so don't even think about calling me on that!) Anyhoo, as long as it's one less album from some airheaded teenage dance pop slut/prettyboy, it has some value...I guess."
2,"Disappoinnted, I thought it would be more groundbreakin","He seems to be stuck in rut. The lyrics of each song basically say the same damn thing ""I'm in pain"" with a little dash of optimism sprinkled in. I thought he would be more experimental and colorful in his sound as he was on Downward Spirl and Broken, instead it is bland and extremely repetitious. Nada Loco about it. Wasn't moved by any of it. Take more shrooms, Trent."
3,TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!,"The thing about this Nine Inch Nails CD is that it rather different from all the others. You have to like the art of ""music"" in order to appreciate it. There's only one song that almost sounds like the classic ""March of the Pigs"" and that is ""STARFU**ERS, INC."" Don't expect much but a bunch of background-sounding music and predicatble lyrics. Upsetting because it took so long for Nine Inch Nails to release another album and I thought it was because he was going to rip out our ears."
4,Trent's back,"The wait was long but worth it. The Fragile is a great album, but it fails to overtake The Downward Spiral. Eventhough you really can't compare any two NIN albums, The Fragile most resembles Pretty Hate Machine, which was a great album at the time of its release. Overall, The Fragile is one of the best pieces of work to come out of the mind of Trent Reznor."
4,can it get any better...yea it can.,i was very surprised with this cd. trent did an excellent job on this double cd. this is one of his best cd's to date. a must have for anyone looking to broaden their musical horizons
5,A BRILLIANT RECORD,"Definitely not the Downward Spiral, The Fragile molds sounds into new landscapes, making the most horrible noise sound beautiful. Beginning with the the hammering and the sawing of ""Somewhat Damaged,"" you know Trent Reznor has not changed his sound but more redefined especially on the instrumental tracks which seem to convey more of a sense of Reznor's alienation and misunderstanding of society. For example, the French titled ""La Mer"" begins with a piano, remniscent of the Smashing Pumpkins piano ballad that begins Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness, and then with the introduction of a wild drum loop becomes the chaotic music that Nails is best known for. And despite the long running time The Fragile leaves you hungering for more with a sound that is in one word: brilliant."
5,BEST PoP EVER,"Best POP cd of the year, by the best POP artist of the decade.. ""we're in this together"" is more pop and accessible then Anything Backstreet boys and its fodder will ever come up with. Best Double CD since Roni Size's New Forms."
2,Genius? Nope.,"I like NIN to a point, but the truth is Reznor isn't a visionary, and he doesn't tread any new musical ground. Big Black(though not exactly an ""industrial"" band) put out records in the 80s that not only laid the groundwork for what later became ""industrial rock"", but also blow bands like NIN completely out of the water.... all recorded on a DIY budget that's probably equivalent to what it cost Trent to record and produce ONE of the tracks on The Fragile. The Big Black song ""Kerosene"" alone contains more genius and intensity than this entire 2-disc set combined."
2,They could be so much better,"I bought this cd hoping for something as good or even better than their first album ""Pretty Hate Machine"" but what I got was an album like the ""Downward Spiral"" with a slow beat and sick lyrics. A lot of this cd is cryptical whispering and whining sounds. I do admire Reznor though for doing the music that he wants to do. Reznor's music does have a message too but it is not a message that should be heard it is just depressing. After this I will never buy a Nine Inch Nail album."
4,a few things i just have to say....,"ok, so it isn't as heavy as nin previous works, and it is a bit brighter...but that doesn't mean it sucks. this album had to grow on me...after a while, though, i couldn't stop listening to it. i wish it was darker, i wish it was heavier, but this is what trent has offered us, and i'm satisfied."
5,Holy Sh*t.,"This is the only short explanation for this CD. Every song on the CD was better than the last. I thought that I was a Nine Inch Nails fan before this but, this CD makes all of the other NIN CDs suck. I felt a strange peacfulness even when I listened to the hard songs. I don't have enough words to explain how superior this CD is."
3,"More of the same, which isn't necessarily bad...","Fragile sounds a lot like The Downward Spiral. This isn't really a bad thing I suppose, but I would have really liked to see the level of innovation over the last album that TDS had over Pretty Hate Machine. It's not Trent's fault that so many other bands have put out recycled NIN wannabe crap (Filter, Marilyn Manson, etc..), but did Trent have to turn around and put out his OWN wannabe crap? At least he's only ripping off his own material (well, okay, with some help from early nineties Ministry and Big Black...)"
2,What?,I got into nin back in 1990. Someone introduced me to pretty hate machine and it opened a door for me and allowed me to start appreciating all kinds of new bands. I also enjoyed Broken but as time went on I felt like Trent was losing his sincerity and the fire that made his music good. The Fragile just left me questioning why I even bothered. It's two discs of very blah industrial music. It sounds like he picked up the scraps leftover from Downward Spiral and just pieced together a two cd set. There wasn't one song on these cd's that I can even remember the title to since it was all so blah.The only reason the fragile got two stars is because it's good filler music. In other words I can play it for background noise and it doesn't turn my stomach. But there just isn't anything powerful here whatsoever. If you're new to nin start off with broken.. you'll be happier.
2,miserable,"Here we go again. More of the same from Trent Reznor. Two discs chock full of his angst, depression, unhappiness, etc., etc. Despite all the praise heaped on Mr. Reznor, I think he is an extremely overrated artist. Come on, Trent. Try something other than the ""I'm miserable"" routine for your next disc."
2,"Life Really Isn't So Bad, I Promise!","It is hard to believe that music such as this was ever relevant, but apparently it was. Mr. Reznor and his cohorts continue to amaze the youth of America who have ""no one that understands them"" and bore and embarass the old coots like me who grew out of this moody brooding back in the first half of the last decade. Don't get me wrong, I would rather see a child of mine listen to NIN than be a swing kid...no wait, I wouldn't, and that's saying a great deal considering my deep DEEP dislike of that whole swing deal. Rather than let his bad vibes spoil everyone else's day, Trent should wipe off the spiffing blue eyeshadow (oooh...disturbed, man), take the money he makes off this two-disc set, buy a nice house in the tropics, and retire to a life of leisure."
4,Good album,I really like this album by NIN. I appreciate it when an artist does decide to give us a 2 disc album. The more music the better! It's definitely a different direction for NIN. It's another step in the evolution of Trent Reznor and his music.
4,NIN best album,"NIN is a product of the 20th century NOT the 19th, and there are many great double albums. Broken/Fixed offers more intensity but it's a great recovery from ""the perfect drug"" The music is derivative from Skinny Puppy however"
2,a bit too boring,"I was really looking forward to the ""maybe best album"" by NIN. After listening to it I have to say that I was disappointed and find it rather boring. There máy be two songs I like okay, but the others seem too slow and of not much variety to me.Maybe I have to listen to it more to really appreciate it, but up to this point I am just disappointed..."
3,Ain't worth NOTHING.,"I was very excited about the release of this new cd. The day it came out I took my lunch jour to go buy it. Then later I listened to it. I was very let down. There are a few good sounds, but only six out of the 23 songs were worth releasing. The Fragile does not compare to The Downward Spiral. It was unoriginal. More of the same old same old. If you don't want to be let down, don't buy this cd. Instead get the Smashing Pumpkins latest cd, Adore. Sorry Trent."
3,"don't hurt me, NIN fans","i discovered nine inch nails a couple months ago, after listening to ""With Teeth"". that album, with ""Year Zero"" coming in a close second, were some of the best i have heard, by anyone. however, the songs on this cd seem to be nothing but shouting mixed in with mediocre beats. however, lots of people seem to like it, so maybe i'm wrong. my advice is, listen to some of the songs on youtube first so you can make sure they're you're cup of tea. But With Teeth and Year Zero... amazing. not sure about ""the slip"", haven't listened to it yet."
4,a masterpiece,"This is a departure for NIN, but its still good. Expect many slow dark songs purging the depths of trents soul. Not as guitar driven as pretty hate machine or broken, but dont let that distract you from buying this cd. 5 years in the making, and its worth the wait. Very thought provoking."
5,No need to worry trent still rules!,"The cd finally came out! this girl in my school skipped and brought it back. i was fortunate to get a listen on a disk man, As soon as i can raise the money i'm buying it."
5,Reznor Matures Musically - He does it again,"Well, he's done it again - on his own terms. A marked progression, consistent on all NIN albumns, has shown through again. Refined to almost unbelievable extents, this albumn should be considered a modern masterpiece. Eclectic at times, illustrated best perhaps in the tracks ""even deeper"" and ""pligramage"", it shows an iceberg of musical exploration that we only get to see the tip of - yet at the same time following tried and true NIN themes. Take my advice; listen to it all the way through right away, it will all become very clear..."
5,what can i say but wow,"brilliant, my favorite collection of nin songs ever. trent has grown tremendously in every way imaginable in this cd, and it really was awesome."
4,Almost perfect.,"This is one amazing album. It's musically very deep, and continues to push the limits that you expect ""Nine Inch Nails"" to push. My one complaint though, is that 23 tracks is almost too much to absorb. I often think this could have been even better, had it dropped the weakest eight songs, and been just one disc of excellence. I think the same of Smashing Pumpkin's ""Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness"". But one might also say more is better, and two discs is twice as good. Another gripe is that some parts of tracks are very loud, and others you can barely hear. Still though, this is an absolute must for the fan, but newcomers might enjoy the industrial-pop debut ""Pretty Hate Machine"", or the masterpiece ""The Downward Spiral""."
5,Definatly an amazing piece of music,"Nine Inch Nail's latest offering, The Fragile, is probably their strongest to date. From the opening track ""Somewhat Damaged"" to the end ""Ripe (with Decay)"", this is one amazing album. Spanning two CDs, every song is filled with the dark, industrial sounds which trademark all of Trent Reznor's work. This CD definatly ranks amongst the top 10 of it's release year. A must buy. If you have any comments, please email me at: juannie@gracias.co.uk"
5,One of the Most Important of the 90's,"I'm a 33 year old white guy... I have a wife and a small child... a house in the burbs... an SUV... and a passion for music. I'm a huge fan of Jazz (Miles, Metheny)...... and I think this recording is one of the most important recordings of the 90's. Reznor has created a new form. ""Downward Spiral"" was the first piece... this album completes a painting of sound that will go down in the books. If you love music, in all it's forms, buy this... and explore it. At first it's harsh... listen again. You'll get it!"
5,Mastery,"Trent is god. Every album I think that he is going to lose his touch. I think he is going to tap out his artistic genious, but I am proved wrong again with this album. An extra lengthy double CD is worth at least a week in the player constantly on play. Reznor's lyrical wit and musical genious meld greatly to provide for an overwhelming feel to the album that I hope you never forget. Worth the money, and much more."
5,"Completely not what I expected, but in the BEST way possible","I picked this book up on what I figured was a fluke. I was at a used book store and the title seemed exactly what I was looking for. I had no idea how true that was! I definitely believe that this was God's plan, and boy am I glad I listened! :)This book has completely changed my life, and I am thrilled to recommend it to everyone I know! Just ask my friends... LOL I had no idea what I was getting myself into! I have always had a close relationship with my Father in Heaven, but have struggled with self-esteem my whole life because of abuse issues as a child.This book is SUCH an incredible view into the souls of those who have suffered any kind of abuse -- or for any reason have low self-worth. I could not put it down, and learned SO much about myself!Thank you SO much for writing such a wonderful book! My life will never be the same again... isn't it great! :)JL"
3,Interesting subject matter; writing a bit sparse,"I read GD as part of my book club in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. I thought the subject matter was incredibly interesting. It was one of my first exposures to Native American lore. I also thought the story line and relationships between characters were entertaining. That said, I think there was something missing.I wanted to read more lyrical prose (sorry for the cliche). The subject matter, especially the mysticism, seemed to warrant it. At times I felt it was a very well-researched romance novel. It seemed that Powers just needed someone to urge her to go deeper into some of the descriptions and to give us a few more surprises in the plot."
2,Even Traditional Oral Histories aren't this convoluted,"Sometimes the best intentions at innovative approaches result in something akin to torture. I suspect that Susan Power was envisioning a novel approach to the NA Novel genre. Instead, she sold herself short - and her readers along with her. It was expertly crafted short stories disconnectedly telling differing tales of the same connected story lines, some without resolution and some surprisingly with. Obvious talent such as this should not have as its supreme result a book so unworthy of representing the author. Let us pray she fixes these flaws and continues to hone her amazing story telling gift."
4,Intergenerational Novel of American Indian Families,"This is a very interesting novel about the mystical connectionbetween several generations of American Indian families.The story is about how the magic that is used to heal and themagic that is used to harm are closely linked, and how easilyone type can be transformed into the other.Power's style reminded me ofPractical Magicby AliceHoffman. The story line was mesmerizing, especially thejuxtaposition of person and place."
5,Practically Lyrical,"The editorial and other customer reviews do a good job of covering the characters and basic plot, so I won't go into that.This has to be the best book I've read in months. It's practically lyrical, the sentences are so pretty. The dust jacket is more than a little off on the plot, so don't read that. It's a collection of self contained stories about a messed up family living on a reservation in North Dakota.Each story is narrated by a different person and takes place a random number of years before the last one. The effect is that each new chapter gives you a different understanding of the events in the previous chapters, until you get back to the ""present"" time from the first chapter, where you have a completely new take on everyone involved.It's unusual to find a short story collection this good from such a new author. I highly recommend it."
5,Have been using this product about 15 years,"I rn across this cooker about 15 years ago in a Sears store. I bought it and have been very happy with it every since I bought it.My mother-in-law saw it at Thanksgiving when she came for Thanksgiving Dinner. She wanted to know where I got it and I told her, but also told her that I did not think they were being made any more. To my surprise when I went searching the Internet, I found the exact same product on Amazon. I ordered one and surprised her with it for Christmas.The one I bought many years ago still works great and I was happy to find that they are still being manufactured."
3,Nice while it lasted,"I have owned one of these for several years. I purhcased it for $1 at a yard sale. There are a couple of recipes that are my favorites.If you don't have the seal on exactly right, it will splash a huge mess all over your microwave. Lately the black rim on the lid separated from the top ofthe lid. I tried to gorilla glue it but it didn't work. Was trying to replace it since I did use it throughout the years... but $50? It's hard to find awhole chicken small enough to fit in it."
2,Comes apart after one use,"I just received my tender cooker made by Nordic Ware yesterday 08-16-2011. I was exicted about the idea of it and used it today to cook some turnip greens with a little ham to see how tender they would get in 30 minutes. They came out great, but the metal ring attached to the top of the cooker came off and the glue they use to hold it appears to be little more than the glue that you use hold stickers or labels on. It was very soft and came right off my hand as well. I contacted Nordic Ware and they said I could go a buy some silicone adhesive at any hardware store to reattach the part and that this was not uncommon. They of course do not carry the adhesive. I did line up everything up and used it again and the item is functional, but now I am totally concerned about long term use. Since I can use the product, I will not go to the inconveniece of returning it, but Amazon should do something with Nordic Ware in regard to this."
4,Nordic Ware Tender Cooker,"Nice bullet-proof design. I have a medium sized microwave and this just barely fits (I have to put the pressure cap on after the unit is inside to get sufficient clearance). It makes great rice in about 8 minutes but if you overfill it (more than 1-1.5 cups dry rice max), it will bubble out and make some mess. Cleans up easy."
3,Nordic Ware Microwave Tender Cooker 2.5 Q,"Overall initial impression: good quality, good appearance, fits nicely into my Microwave. Just a little small for items as whole chickens, ribs. First used to cook bonless short ribs. It is necessary to brown meat first before pressure cooking. So, not sure this is a great time saver. Took some adjusting to get the time correct. Fifteen minutes was good. Food tends to ""shrink"" under pressure so my big meaty ribs came out much smaller. I don't see my using this on a daily basis. Will be usefull now and again. Most necessary to have a book or manual to follow as timing is everything. I bought Miss Vickie's Pressure Cooker Recipies as an aid. Book was very helpful."
5,Favorite kitchen tool for 25 years!,I asked for this as a Christmas present when they first came out. My mother made fun of me but got it anyway. Within a few months both she and my sister got their own!Now after 25 years of constant use the ring just separated from the lid and I need to buy another one. I am ecstatic that this is still being made! It is the most essential cooking apparatus in my kitchen.
3,Handy cooker,"I purchased one of these years ago and loved it. The book was full of great recipes. I recently moved and my cooker and it's book were lost. So, I purchased another one. This one arrived with some discolored areas and a few dings but otherwise in good shape. I'm not too fussy so I figured it would be fine. The book is no where near the quality of the previous one and none of my favorite recipes are in there. I now have to figure out how to convert recipes so I can use the cooker again. This makes it far less convenient than it was. I wouldn't have purchased it again if I'd known the book was so anemic."
1,nordic ware tender cooker: caveat emptor,"I bought this tender cooker and never realized that it easily explodes in the microwave, sending water throughout...it fried the electrical circuits on my expensive over the range microwave and now i have to get a new microwave.....please people, be careful...i will never use this item again."
5,Absolutely great Microwave cooker!,"From what I've seen, Nordic Ware does not have a legitimate competitor in this niche, so I'm really glad they haven't stopped making or supporting the Tender Cooker. Like many people, I cannot palate raw or under-cooked Broccoli or Cauliflower and the Tender Cooker nails them with just a couple of ounces of water in 10-12 minutes without the loss of nutrients. It can handle a lot of other things as well, but we use it mostly for vegetables and warming leftovers (does a great job on those too). I bought it so I would be able to cook with two at once, but dropped the lid to my old one and broke it a few weeks after getting this one. I'll be looking for a replacement soon."
2,Gasket doesn't fit,The gasket on the Nordic Ware Microwave Tender cooker is too big and doesn't allow for a tight seal of the cooker. Please ask the vendor to send us a gasket that fits the cooker.
5,Works suprisingly well for what I use it for,"I bought mine about 10 years ago. I cooked a few meals, cannot even remember what, and then put it away for lack of space. Recently I've become a big fan of brown and wild rice but I've not liked the cook times on the stove. So after doing some research, I rediscovered this. Well it has been a real time saver. I can make a cup of uncooked brown or wild rice in about 20 minutes. Occasionally it bubbles out of the top, but nothing major to clean up. I'm really pleased to rediscover this lost treasure in my kitchen."
3,A BREIF (30 min total) BLAST FROM THE PAST!,"Okay, well the tape is longer than that, because there is a nutrition section on a low fat diet that follows the workout. The workout is an approx. 4 min warmup followed by cardio and 23 minutes into it is the ab section. This is followed by stretching. The cardio reminded me of a low-impact class I tried in the late 80's, where I was surrounded by senior citizens whooping it up. Sort of the old Jazzercise days, although the routines aren't choreographed exactly the same. I don't mind the fact that this tape is dated, I expected that and found that it made it a little more entertaining. I thought that the workout was too short, although I can see doing it in the early morning when I typically don't like to hit it too hard. Compared to what is out there now, this is a light workout, but I enjoyed it.FYI - the cover notes that this was previously released as Low Fat Diet & Exercise Program."
4,It's the size of chalkboard chalk,"It was difficult (= not possible) to tell from the picture and description how big these pieces of chalk are. ""Mini"" is a relative term, so all it tells you is that it's smaller than regular sidewalk chalk. I had to order it to find out that the pieces are just the same size as regular chalkboard chalk. Fortunately it wasn't expensive and the delivery was fast, so that I could figure it out before placing a large order. It would have been easy enough to include measurements in the description or a scale next to the picture to indicate the actual size of this item. That would also be helpful for customers who actually want chalkboard-size sidewalk chalk."
5,Great gift,"Kurama Fans will love this chibi doll version plush of him from Yu Yu Hakusho, somewhat hard to find it was a great buy and very cheap too, my friend loved it"
2,Shallow coverage - Maybe okay for beginners,"I have to agree with R. Chester's review. I found the book to be very shallow, almost like the authors were intentionally holding back information so as to not arm their competitors. For example, on page 92, under the heading of PHOTOSHOP TECHNIQUE, there is an interesting picture of a bride, groom and a young child standing on a bridge. Very nice, but no technique is supplied. The authors refer you to page 117 for more on this image but alas, no technique there either.I bought the book to generate some ideas as I'm new to portrait post processing. I learned a little about vignettes, converting to black and white, selective coloring, all very basic stuff. I found better info by doing a search on the web and perusing tutorial sites."
1,A waste of money,"This book should be entitled: ""Basic Photoshop for wedding photographers"". A complete waste of money with simple and cheesy effects. I am very disappointed as the methods in this book will not suit todays high expectations in the wedding market. The book looks like it would apply to the mid 1980's. Very simple and basic instruction methods, taught me absoulutely nothing that I don't already know!"
2,read in 15 minutes,this publisher has a habbit of using the same pictures and tachniques in a number of books and then re packaging for a different audience. I read the book in no time and lernt nothing I'll probarlly never pick it up again
2,It's alright,I thought that this book was THE problem solver as it claimed but I didn't like the format and it sure does not appeal to many college students.
4,Snobby Taffy,"I first read this book because my friend, Jennifer, recommended it to me. After reading it, she described it to me as a exciting book. Also, when I read the back of the book, it seemed really interesting. The picture looked fun, too.In this story, Jana Morgan's friends are all going out with their boyfriends, except for her. She wants Randy, the boy she likes, to ask her, but he didn't. Then when she saw Randy and Taffy hanging out together, she became jealous. Soon, she received a secret admirer letter. Jana and her friends went out to find out who it was. The answer surprised them! I think Jana is a independent girl who is just afraid to spill her feelings. She needs to be more open to guys.I really enjoyed this book because this kind of stuff relates to real life. It was fun and mysterious, yet has to do with boys. These are the things that most teenage girls have to go through. I would recommend this book to girls, especially, if they love a good, fun mystery."
4,"if my 9-yo boy reads it, it's pretty good","if my 9-yo boy reads it, it's pretty good. The poems are clever and have a draw for a child's mind. I recommend it."
3,Not Inspiring Verse,"Ruth Stone's collection of poems, In the Dark, has no real punch. The verse it not particularly inspirational, the language and subject matter not unique, crackling, creative or pungent. In fact, there are few surprises here for the true lover of language. The narrative voice is muddled and confused. The sense of trajectory of the collection is bogged down and sluggish. Overall, this collection is a real disappointment for both fans of poetry or Ruth Stone's work."
4,He's fallen and he can't get up,"First off when I bought this I thought I was buying a normal sized action figure...So I was a bit surprised to get this giant thing. That said except for the face, which looks too evil and grotesque, the figure looks pretty darn cool. There's a lot of potential for posing. The only bad thing is that it's hard to get him to stay standing up. The 1st day I got him he fell over and scratched up some of the paint on his pants. But it's a very good value, if you have space for a gaint Nightcrawler."
5,Love these glasses.,"We just love these glasses. They are durable, and just the right size for my small hands. But my husband likes them too. They always come out of the dishwasher sparkling clean."
5,Strong and beautiful,"They arrived on time. When I opened the box I was nicely surprised. These glasses have an elegant touch. They are heavy, strong and can be set with nice table settings."
4,THE KENTON INNOVATION YEARS,"For a serious Kenton fan, this is a must. This is where ""Progressive Jazz"" began. Personnel on this CD include Jazz greats Bob Cooper, Art Pepper, Bud Shank Conte Condoli, Bill Russo, Shelly Manne and a host of other classic Kenton Band members, including a young trumpet player from Canada named Maynard Ferguson.Because of the date of the recordings, thay are all in Mono but nontheless a piece of History. Also included is what Kenton called their venture into ""highly experimental"" music . (City of glass suite)This indeed was the ""Kenton Era"""
2,It Didn't Last One Trip,"This is a nice looking case and well designed. Unfortunately, the magnet inside the case is not position correctly for the 8300 and the phone does not recognize that it is in the holster.The first time I traveled out of town I snapped the case off my belt. The plastic broke off the clip. Needless to say, I didn't buy another one.Pass on this case!"
3,Not easy to learn from.,"This book is supposed to start you off on Aebersols system. As such it should be made easier for beginners to understand. Instead I recommend starting with the books called 'Chop Monsters' 1 and 2 by Shelly Berg. They also have cd's with a unique call and response system. Also the way Shelly Berg presents music theory is very clever and easier to absorb. These books prepared me for the Aebersol material, and should be done first."
4,Works So Far,I bought this exhaust manifold for my 1970 plymouth slant 6 about a year ago. I have been replacing the factory ones way to many times so I decided to try this one. So far no problems. The factory ones always crack and make noise but this one has worked for about a year now and no cracking or noise. The only thing that is different from the factory is the automatic choke. The factory one does not work on this manifold. Go to carbsonly.com and have them sell yoou the correct electric choke.
4,shimmery dream drones...,"This series of ambient & drone compositions shimmers and glistens with a crystalline digital veneer. Standouts include the stately and even majestic coolness of the filmic 'Into The Marshes They Drove Me', which features sounds sourced from the post-rock band ISIS. Further listening on cuts like 'Coral Gables' recalls a softer, gentler electro-ambient vibe, like a melding of Basic Channel, Eno, and prime Tangerine Dream maybe. Kowalsky's use of space and frequency is subtle and pristine, and his sounds emanate like a gentle glacial drift with the first traces of life springing forth. A very enjoyable and interesting release that fills the room with contemplative texture and fresh, clear air."
4,Love the Heater,Heater exactly as described. Easily installed. Works perfectly and completely heats the space for which it was intended. The company that shipped the heater was lazy with communication emails and shipping information. But it did finally arrive.
5,Great music,This was exceptional because the CD was wonderful and it is sometimes hard to find the artists you love so it filled a need for us.
4,Little album of energy.,"I love chick bassists!!! Anywho, great musicmanship and nice hooks and melodies! Great things will arise from this band. I love you Melissa."
1,Dull and boring,"I loved reading the book to my daughter. It's such a fun read that I wanted her to have the CD. I can't stand the boring drivel and my 4 y.o. wasn't much interested either. I played it for her once and she walked away after two minutes. I find it just too sweet and boring.My apologies to any fans, but the CD did just not live up to the book. Interestingly, I bought a copy of the book with a CD with Ray Charles reading it. That was a much more fun version."
3,Great CD!,"This is a great CD. The only problem I had was upon arrival the plastic case holding the CD was cracked in several places, front and back."
5,Health Through Nutrition and Aerobic Exercises,"The information in this older book is still scientific. The author believes in a no non-sense approach to losing body fat and building muscles. Along with the information on health, nutrition, how we build fat and how to fight it, the author gives common sense advice on easy to do light weight lift and aerobic exercises.The writing style is humorous as well as matter of fact and practical. Very good writing, and the illustrations are funny, brilliant and hilarious.No need to diet with this program, simply pick one or more of the indoor and outdoor aerobic exercises suggested in the book, and have fun!"
4,Wrong book,The Daily GuidePost is an excellent devotional.I ordered the 2002 devotional for a friend. The book that was received was for the year 2001
4,"sharp, works well",These are nice scissors that are sharp and cut well. I wish they had a cover on them though.
2,Mala calidad de sonido. Bad sound quality,"Desafortunadamente la calidad de sonido hace que el comprar este disco no valga la pena. Unas canciones, como Pio Pio si suenan perfectas, mientras Cali suena como la musica que oigo a veces en las estaciones AM en el medio de una tormenta electrica, y la montan~a del oso la calidad es mejor pero no al nivel de se deberia esperar. Yo no compro un CD para escuchar eso.Yo recomendaria que los interesados en la musica de la sonora poncen~a compraran el 45 aniversario, que tiene varias de las mismas canciones, grabadas mas recientemente. Quizas ese suene como debe sonar un CD."
5,Awesome stuff!,"This is the cream that never makes it to the barn! It's great on hands, anything chapped, fingernails or feet. You will be amazed."
5,WARNING! This is WORLD OF FOOD in sheep's clothing!,"This is of course a master work, as are all of Wolfert's books. I am only writing here to spell out what the book blurb above fails to make clear: This is a REPRINT of Wolfert's WORLD OF FOOD book, first published in 1988, given a new, ostensibly more sexy, marketable name. So if you already have WORLD OF FOOD, don't buy this -- but do treat yourself to any other of her books -- they're all winners."
5,Kids loved it!,All working parts are put together well and my son loved it! Sold it in a yard sale and the kid who got it was so excited!
1,If there were a 0 stars alternative . . .,"The replacement hands (no claws) are good. Other than that, this may be the worst action figure I've ever bought. Might even be the worst one I've ever seen, even in pictures. It is almost impossible to get it into a pose that doesn't look stupid. The costume is molded plastic and demands to be put in one pose to accomodate the molded wrinkles and creases.I have it two stars for durability because I tossed it into a box. I have no way of knowing whether it would wear out.I kept the hands. I'm wondering if some day I'll be able to stick them on a really good figure of some sort that needs hands that will open and close.If I'd received this figure for free, I'd still have thought it was not worth the money."
3,3 more episodes of Happy Lesson,"The first episode is a expanded version of the first episode from the series. The other two are brand new, expanded episodes, dealing with swimsuits, Christmas and sisters. The episodes are funny but not that funny. They are touching but not that touching. The extras include sketches, opening and closing songs (which are new songs) and trailers. 75 minutes of humor and moms!If you are a fan you may wish to get this disc, but get it used. With only three episodes it's not really worth getting new."
5,La Mala Educacion,"I hate long-winded reviews in the case of films that really just need to be seen, so I'll suffice to say that it had incredible twists and turns, stunning acting, gorgeous Jean-Paul Gaultier wardrobe and is definitely worth owning. Gael Garcia-Bernal is absolutely amazing and is an actor to be reckoned with.I have a love for films that make people uncomfortable, and this doesn't disappoint in that respect. Another Almoldovar winner."
5,A challenge!,"I saw this movie during the Norwegian International Film Festival in August 2004. I was a jury member in the festival and this movie was the first one we had on our program of movies we had to review. ""Bad Education"" is a movie with an important mission, a little provocative, but really worth seeing. In this movie everything is not revealed at once. One after another the viewer will discover something new in the lifes of the main characters, and it's difficult to guess how it will end. ""Bad Education"" is a challenge of a movie. Beautiful and without doubt ""Almodóvar's"" best since ""All about my mother"". It's important that movies like these are made."
1,Disappointing,"I find Almodovar's work to be patchy at best: while his ""All About My Mother,"" ""High Heels,"" and ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" deserve the attention they receive, recent efforts such as ""Talk to Her"" and this one have been unsatisfying.Almodovar's film revolves around the suspicious goings-on occuring at a Catholic boys' school. Of course, we have the requisite pedaphile subplot in several scenes, as one of the main characters finds himself gathering the attentions of the head priest. Does anybody else find this situation a little contrived? I mean, can we have a Catholic priest in a film sometime who isn't a pedaphile? Furthermore, I think Almodovar could come up with something a tad more original, without needing to retread the evening news.For a better introduction to Almodovar's genius, watch ""High Heels"" instead."
2,R Rated version comes digitally censored!!!,"I was shocked to see digital censoring of a scene in this movie.In one scene, which was actually tame when I originally viewed it at the movies, was totally blurred digitally for about 1 full minute. This ruined the movie for me. Don't buy the R Rated version."
5,Gael Garcia Bernal can go to H.....,"Gael Garcia Bernal can goo to Heaven on my back no matter how far and long the journey may be. He is right now my most favorite man: talented, intelligent, versatile, and any of another 12 to 20 positive characteristics that I will keep to myself for now. And I haven't even mentioned yet, he is as Hot as a Blackspmith's ROD!"
2,Alas! -- Wasted Potential,"This is a film that could have been an engrossing, poignant drama recounting the corruption of innocence by an abusive Catholic clergyman, but which, instead, chose to relinquish perspicuity in favor of artsy-fartsiness and wound up leading its eye-squinting audience down one confused path after another.After fifty perplexing minutes of time-and-space-disjointedness -- unable to keep track of who, when, where and why -- I decided my otherwise obsessive need for sticking it out to the bitter end could be better served screening my unopened mail.Joel Kovacik"
3,A different Almodovar,"I didnt like this movie as much as Almodovar's past films, because it's lacking his craziness. Instead you get a film noir feel, like that from a Hitchcock movie. The movie is still worth seeing, and it has some really great singing in it too."
1,Almodovar cheapens his own movie,I usually like Almodovar's films but he cheapens this one with pseudo porn which I find very boring and undercutting of the themes of the movie.
2,Not for Now People,"After listening to The Impossible Bird, I wish Lowe had never taken the Country turn in the road. He was much more potent and palateable when he stayed within the his natural abilities of pop and rock. Lost in his Englishman-goes-Country stylings is the real genius of being an English pop master that were once evident on Pure Pop/Jesus of Cool and his production efforts with the Pretenders and the Damned. This music doesn't feel true to it's roots! Lowe's voice simply wasn't made for the Country influenced genre. It saddens me that someone who could have (should have) made many more brilliant pop records has been side tracked by a fascination for American Country music, something he should leave on his record player. I found many of the tracks on Bird sounding rather contrived. And all the twanging just got on my nerves."
5,The Only Camaro Book You Will Ever Need,Wow! One of THE best Camaro books I have ever read. With a complete history of the legendary American muscle car this book has it all--DEFINATELY worth reading. This book is a must for all Camaro enthusiasts. Steve Hartsock Director- Camaro Club of Delaware
4,weird sizing,"Okay so I got this ring because I thought it looked different to what I usually have. Which it is, I bought one other ring from this company. The only issue I really have is that even though both are the same size the other ring is kinda small and this one is too big. But I didn't want to pay like $4 to get a different size because usually the other size is way too small. But I will say that it does look a lot like the picture, it is light, and a little bigger then what your first thought at looking at the ring maybe when you first get it. Over all its a nice ring for the price and the bright side is the shipping was free and it does not turn your fingers green."
1,A matter of style,"Lisa Michaels, from The New York Times Book Review, hits it right on the nose: ""Reading Can Xue's fiction is like running downhill in the dark; you've got momentum, but you don't know where you're headed.... the stories in The Embroidered Shoes describe strange, disordered worlds where people speak in riddles and time and setting are as fickle as the wind.""If this is a style you enjoy, then go for it. To me, it was a very hard, dissatisfying read. As a reader, i prefer to have more structure and more guidance from the author. I found Can Xue's stories disjointed and poorly integrated. Please beware..."
5,"Increases fun factor for kids, wii sports is still the favorite game",Boo to the negative review about covering the IR sensor. When you play wii sports the IR sensor is not considered in the interaction. I know because I play wii sports with my nephew while I'm across at the other side of the LR.I'd admit its corny for Adults but for the kids its a blast. Funny thing is that wii sports is still the game of choice when all the kids are visiting. I'd say this product increase the fun factor.
3,Not for me.,"Too hard to insert and remove the wiimote. Golf club head points in wrong direction. Bat and racket are fun to use, however both block the front of the wiimote, so you can't select from wii menu once wiimote is inserted. For me - not worth the trouble."
3,Baseball Attachment,"The baseball attachment flew off during my swing and cracked my Tv. Yes, it did click when I put it back on after pictching an inning. The attachment is not broken and it did click back on after it ""flew"" off. Watch it!!! You could break your television."
1,Doesn't work,"This was a waste of money. When you put the Wii remote in the holder, the buttons don't line up and you can't use the controller."
3,"hmmm, I must be doing something wrong","When the controller is placed into the tennis racquet, golf club or baseball bat the controller does not work. I believe it is due to the fact that the end of the controller does not connect to the Wii sensor bar; because it is being covered by the racquet, bat or club.However, the arrival time was great and they were as advertised."
5,A concise and detailed introduction to data web controls,"A must have book for anyone responsible for developing asp.net data-centric web applications. The book provides concise, yet in-depth details about the diverse functionality of the three major web data control objects: DataGrid, DataList, and Repeater, and when to use each within a given web application.Moreover, with numerous, step-by-step hands-on examples, this book is not only a great reference, but also a fantastic teaching tool. A terrific book for asp.net developers at all development levels."
4,ASP.NET Datagrid Control,"I am a professional developer and I found Scott's book to be one of the best examples on how to write a technical book. His examples are practical and usable. The Datagrid, Datalist, and Repeater are throughly examined and I use it as a reference for work."
3,Good how to get started but riddled with errors,"This is a useable book for learning the basics of the new data list controls. Even though it is riddled with mistypes and sentences that don't make sense it is a good resource to get started using these controls. Basically it explains what MS should have.This is not an advanced book as I thought when buying it, if you have worked with these controls for a few months then the book will probably not be what you expect.If you are just starting to use these controls and can remember that it's riddled with grammatical and theoretical errors I would recomend it, as the good outweighs the bad.After seeing how bad SAMS did on the editing of this book I wonder if I will buy any SAMS books in the future."
4,This is not the Tony Curtis version of Houdini,"The author certainly captured the character of Houdini perfectly since it reflects everything I have read about him (other than the TV/Movie version of his life and death). Some fans of illusional magic may not like the exposure of illusion methods while for others may find it makes it more interesting. Along with illusion, there is the paranormal aspect of Houdini's life. A very different last illusion."
5,Haunting--in more ways than one!,"This book drew me right into the mind of Harry Houdini. The author's deft handling of period details and historical facts made it easy to believe--even when the spirits start arriving. It's a fascinating blend of reality and the edge of madness. A melancholy and moving read. It took me places I'd never thought to go, and made me glad I'd gone along."
3,I enjoyed this book,"A worthwhile read, short and sweet. Really good if you're familiar with Houdini and magic history. I hope to be reading a bit more by Mr. Savile soon..."
2,Houdini's Last Illusion,"The book was an easy read, hence the rating given. I purchased the book based on the subject matter AND the ratings given it by others. Hum. The subject still holds some facination for me and I do think the author did a good job of research and for that I praise him. The presentation was lacking, the story weak, the ending poor."
4,It's a Beanie,Got this for a friend who collects Jaguar stuff. It fit the bill and fit in the Christmas stocking. :)
5,As good as Wustoff,I own an earlier model of this knife as well as a $35.00 Wustoff Grand Prix2 paring knife. Somehow I find myself reaching for this knife either as much if not more than my expensive Wustoff. This knife does not feel as sturdy as the Wustoff but holds an edge just as sharp and for just as long. It is not so flimsy though as to hinder performance. It is by far the best knife for the money. This knife is holds up over years of use. The blade does not get lose or wobbly over time. This is a very good knife in spite of the seemingly light weight construction.
5,as sharp as they get,"I ordered two of these, and when they first arrived I was disappointed at how light they looked and felt. When I started using them, however, I was very pleasantly surprised at how great they lie in my hand and how SHARP they are! If you're not reeeeally careful, it's easy to cut yourself. Ask me how I know, ha ha.These are my favorite knives now, and I will definitely be getting more."
4,Victorinox is always sharp,"I love this knife. In fact, I have two of them. They are a really great price for what you get. Even though I have other knives with a variety of sizes for different purposes, this is often my go to knife for small jobs. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is because I feel like the handle is not as ergonomic as some of their other products. Also, it doesn't come with a blade protector like some other knives, which I find to be helpful since I keep these in a draw and not a knife block. I have another Victornox bread knife which is the best thing since sliced bread. (How could I resist saying that?) Here's the linkVictorinox Swiss Army 10-1/4-Inch Fibrox Wavy Bread Knife, Black. I purchased a set of inexpensive knife guards and am very happy.Mundial Safe Edge Knife Guards, Set of 5.Overall I trust this company's products and have never been disappointed."
3,"A bit flimsy, slippery and not quite sharp enough","I have 6 other Victorinox Fibrox kitchen knives and each is very good. However, this is not on par with those.I thought I was getting the Fibrox handle, but this is not similar to the others. This is harder and slipperier. The blade seemed dull from the beginning and not much helps in getting it sharper. I have a Chef's Choice and it doesn't seem to help for long. It is not dull, but compared to the other knives, this just doesn't seem like the same caliber.Finally, the blade is a bit too flexible. Slice very soft fruit and veggies, sure, but try using it for paring or cutting firmer fruit (an apple) and it lacks strength.If the knife was $5 or $6 then I would call it a bargain, but at $9 it seems like you are paying for a name and not for quality."
3,"Good blade, but Oh, that handle!","Before I bought this, another poster mentioned how light and flimsy the knife felt. He also said the blade took a good edge and the knife was useful.I'll second that. It's a decent steel blade, certainly not very heavy, but that's OK for a paring knife, where flexibility is as important as strength.But the handle is as light and cheap as can be imagined. Just plastic molded around the tang (and I have no idea how far the tang extends into this handle). It does not give me one whit of confidence about the long-term viability of the knife.So, if you just need a economical, utilitarian Paring knife, want a sharp edge, and don't care what it looks or feels like in your hand, this knife is for you.If you expect to feel confidence in your tools, and want something substantial in your hand, this knife is going to disappoint you."
5,Surprisingly Great,We were surprised at what a great knife this is. It is a good as knives costing much more. It is very sharp and has kept its sharpness.
3,So-so.,"The knife is too light, the blade feels a little flimsy and it doesn't hold an edge as well as I'd expect. I paid a little more for a Messermeister Meridian Elite 4"" paring knife and have been a lot happier with it."
2,Just Another Disposable Knife,"I had high expectations for this knife based on the good reviews. We have a 2.75 in Henckels Twin Pro S Paring/Boning Knife that my wife absolutely loves and uses it as a paring knife. I wanted something a little longer that will hold up to my forceful ways.This Victorinox 3 1/4 Paring Knife is sharp in a dull way and the blade is flimsy. Basically, it is sharp enough to peel and cut, but you would have to apply more force with the fear that the blade may snap. For example, to slice an apple, this knife would stop at the apple core and requires more force. The Henckels paring knife would just slice right through without stopping.You actually will get what you pay for with this knife, meaning a $5 knife. Compared to the Henckels $40 knife, you can definitely see and feel the $35 difference."
2,Not on par with other Victorinox products,"I am a big fan of Victorinox, and I own several of their products along with much more pricey knives. I believe firmly that Victorinox knives are the best value on the market. With one exception - the paring knives. Yes, they are ridiculously cheap, so one should not expect much. Unlike other Victorinox products, the knives quality parallels the price. The blade is flimsy and provides little confidence that it would not break. The knives arrive reasonably sharp, but not nearly as sharp as other Victorinox knives. They dull easily and unlike other Victorinox knives, sharpening does not help all that much. My guess is that the steel used is too think and possibly different from what Victorinox uses for other knives. If you want a reasonably priced top-notch paring knive, look at Henckels, and if you want to spend the money, still look at Henckels, and if you want the looks and want to spend the money, Global western 3.5 inch paring knife is hard to beat."
2,Not as good as i thought,I read good reviews about this product. It did not meet my expectations at all. It was bending all over and I just didn't like it. Not worth the money.
4,Seems like a great value,"Only used it once so far, it felt like it just about FELL through some limes (I had to test it on something). Not much to look at if you want to show off your fancy cutlery, but for 1/8th the cost of, say, Cutco..."
4,Great little paring knife,"This knife is handy for peeling apples and also for slicing. The knife is small and lightweight with good balance and the handle is textured so it doesn't slip. And it's sharp! I've used it to slice lemons, carrots, potatoes, apples, etc. and it cuts smoothly with little effort. This is a smaller than usual paring knife; I think the standard size has a 4"" blade, but the length is great for fine mincing of garlic and herbs. Good value for the money."
4,Nice knife at a great price,"I'm getting quite attached to the Victorinox line of knives -- very good quality and a great price point. Cooks Illustrated rated their Chef's knife (~$25) as best buy -- over several other $110+ knives by big brand names.This little paring knife is small, easy to handle and wicked sharp. The black 'Fibrox' (whatever that is) handle is slip resistant and dish-washer safe as far as I can tell.Cooks looking for a big beefy blade should look elsewhere, but that's the only negative I can find ..."
5,My new kitchen baby!,"Do you want to know how much I love this knife? I love it so much, I HID it from the rest of the family. It is MY knife, my new kitchen baby and I DO NOT want to share it! It works beautifully and is wonderfully comfortable even when cutting a LOT of vegetables at one time. Love, love, love, I LOVE this knife!Can I give it six stars?"
3,"If you want chef quality knives, this isn't it.","This is not a high quality cutting tool. It works and has a decent edge on it out of the box but it is extremely flimsy. The blade is too flexible for my taste and the cheap plastic handle makes it look like something out of the dollar store. Does it cut? Yes. But ergonomically, it doesn't fit the hand very well and your control of it feels sloppy. I much prefer more professional level knives with carbon steel blades and riveted handles with some heft to them."
2,lasted two weeks,I liked it at first but it got dull quickly and the blade is so thin and weak that it did not sharpen very well.
5,Love this knife!!!,Bought this knife for my son who loves to cook and he is blown away by how much he loves these knives. He even brings them with him when he cooks here. Great value!!!!
2,Always looking for a great knife,"This knife was more flimsy than I expected, with a thin, flexible blade and small handle. I expected a fibrox handle and got a thin plastic handle. I like all the other Victorinox Fibrox knives that I have bought, especially the Santoku knife. It appears the prices have jumped a lot since I bought mine, around October or November of last year. I always wash my knives by hand and dry them immediately with a dish towel, and then let them sit out a bit before putting them away, to be sure that they are dry before putting them in their sheaths. This knife looks like it rusted or became discolored like rust toward the cutting edge. It still is sharp and cuts good, but the discoloration is ugly."
4,super sharp,"This is my third Victorinox knife, got it as a Christmas gift. it is indeed super sharp... far superior to the Chicago Cutlery that I've owned forever, and certainly as good as the Henkel paring knife that I recently got, but is a much better value.It is dishwasher safe which is nice... and as inexpensive as this knife is, you can afford to own 2 or 3 of them."
5,What a great little paring knife,I bought this paring knife about a month ago and have been using it since. The real test was peeling apples with it. It passed the test with flying colors. It took the apple peels off with virtually no wasted fruit underneath. It moved through those apples like a hot knife through butter. It is very sharp and it handles really nicely. I really love it. It does a great job on any fruits and small vegetables. I would recommend it highly. The handle is just the right length and thickness for average hands.
3,Looks are deceiving,"Functions very well. Still very sharp after purchasing about 4 months ago. However, it has a flimsy feel(lacks heft) and looks very inexpensive."
3,Blade dulled quickly,"When I first received the knife I was impressed and even frightened I might accidentally cut myself because theblade was so sharp, but it didn't last! Only after a few weeks of use the blade became so dull I wondered if I wasusing the wrong side! What a pity, already have to have it sharpened. Other than that, I love the size and it islightweight and easy to handle!"
2,A little disappointed,"Even though I usually like everything recommended by Cooks Illustrated, this paring knife does not feel comfortable in my hand the handle is thinner that most of my other paring knives."
5,Great value,"Exactly what we were searching for: Slender paring knife, very sharp - best buy in other product review(s) (TV) -and at an attractive price."
4,Good Little Knife,I tried this after reading other reviews and I'm not disappointed. It is a good everyday kitchen knife for paring needs. It would have been better if the handle had a little more heft - but I guess for the price I couldn't expect a more solid handle.
5,superb,This is the best I have ever seen. I bought a couple of paring knives from a local Bakery supply store and cut my hand a couple of times. No control at all. I saw this Victorinox on Amazon and the ad said contol. Well it is so great. I will not waste my money on any other brands. The bakery knives were not cheap in price just in usage.You just can't go wrong with Victorinox.
4,"As good as any, better than most, inexpensive","Just like its big brother, the Forschner 8-inch Chef Knife (see my review), this one does the job,and is relatively inexpensive. If it had a little more heft, and a slightly longer handle I would have given it five stars."
2,Decent paring knife.,"A decent paring knife; a little on the flimsy side, but worth the inexpensive price."
5,Love it!,"I was totally surprised when I used it the first time to cut my fruits. I didn't feel any resistance at all when cutting apple, orange,... I never felt that way with any other knives I've had. So from now, I can cut up my fruit with very little effort using this knife. Best paring knife ever at very reasonaly price. However, it's a little strange when holding the knife since it's sooo light"
3,Feels cheap in my hand,"First off - I am a ""swiss army knife"" kind of guy (my wife refers to me as MacGyver), so I was happy to buy Victorinox kitchen knives. I have bought an 8"" chef's knife (which I absolutely LOVE) and a 5"" narrow boning knife (I'm also very pleased with that one). This knife, however, was not sharp when received, and the handle seems too narrow. It is not flimsy, but just feels like a ""dollar store"" knife. I gave it three stars because, once I sharpened this knife with 3-4 strokes on my steel, it cuts beautifully! It also seems to hold that edge quite well, but I can't get over the feeling that I am not using a quality knife just from the way it feels in my hand. I didn't pay much for it but I still probably wouldn't recommend it. I don't feel like I have good control over the knife because of the shape of the handle."
5,AWESOME KNIFE,"Great knife. We are vegetarians and use it to mostly slice, dice, cut veges and fruits. NO Pineapples with this knife.You can only go right with this knife. It's awesome!"
1,"Sad and sorry,","I did not expect to get a card board box for table and chairsI amn not taking out of the box, I will send it back. Thisis not the picture i saw when i placed the order, they dida switch on me and i am not happy."
2,CardBoard,"Although it does keep my kids off of the bigger table it is made out of 100% recycled cardboard, pretty sturdy and the colors are nice. It's nice for drawing or doing small projects but isn't something that would last you forever"
1,Never advice to buy this table,I thought its a goog product in good price but its just waste of money. my sons sit hardly two or three time and its legs fold down. its totally misrepresentation on its ad. never advice to buy this item because this is not plastic. just waste of money only in 5 days.
1,Solid & Durable????...,"I bought this ""SOLID & DURABLE"" table & two chair set for my daughter, because I trusted the positive reviews of this product, but they are wrong. I have had this for about 3 weeks and one chair cracked realy but in the base. The table is unstable on carpet.Maybe it could be useful for traveling do its light weight, but the more you assemble and take it apart the worse it gets.I payed to much for a bad product."
1,Do not get unless you want to get paper!,I can not believe this. They should've put At the top of the page that this is cardboard not durable. Not for busy kids.
3,Poor material,I actually bought this last year for Christmas and right away it didn't last a long time.Cheap material and had to buy a really sturdy one non-cardboard like this one from Little Tykes.
1,THIS SUCKS,ITS CARDBOARD W T F!!!! I never even assembled the stupid thing I could have made this out of free boxes from the grocery store. NOT IMPRESSED!!!
5,This is a great album.,"Listened to this first in the 70's. They were realtively unknown. Some friends in a local Chicago Southside band played several of the songs. Guitar solos very good. Long live that early German rock. It's great! Rate it with some of Zeppelins early albums. Overall a solid album. Not one clinker in the bunch. Don't know about the bonus tracks, though. Wonder what the kids of today might think of it. album recommends playing at maximum volume. How can you go wrong with that? On Billingsgate Records, I think. Their logo was a guy with a big boot about to kick someone in the a$$."
4,An early metal classic,"If you like the first Led Zeppelin album, this one is for you! The interplay between the guitar riffs, the bass, and the organ is incredible, and the music as a whole is pure headbanger metal. Musically this is in the same vein as ""Dazed and Confused"", ""How Many More Times"", and other classic Zeppelin tracks. ""Toxic Shadows"" is the best track here, followed by ""Baby You're a Liar"" and the title track.Be advised though; later Lucifer's Friend releases veered away from heavy metal and into jazz fusion and pop. This first release is not representative of their later work."
2,graylosophy,"Tell you what - if you want to hear Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and what I think sounds more like very early Scorpions - buy these bands' CDs, they're much, much better. We're comparing apples to oranges here, my friends. This band hits on all cylinders about 10 percent of the time. Granted, that 10 percent is worth paying attention to. There's definitely some good stuff here, but I just can't gush over it. It's an oddity. Maybe that's the attraction."
4,It was decent,Well it was very decent then it froze the first 5 minutes then after cleaning it hasn't froze since then
2,needs improvement,"I just bought this game 2 months ago and I was really excited that I got the game right away. But the gameplay was really bad. Goalkeepers were a bit impossible to score. I was about to shoot the ball at like about 80-90% of power right in front of the goalkeeper. And the goalkeeper caught the ball like it was nothing (depends on what level). The ball was completely fast pace, I got a little headache so I stopped. The game has some little scenes that try to make the game look epic. In Xbox 360, Fifa 06 World Cup has great graphics and great gameplay. And I liked how they putted confetti when players celebrate when they score a goal.ReviewXbox 360: 9.1Gamecube: 8.0my review in this game: 6.4"
4,Oh the curse-ed X-Box,"I love soccer games, having been exposed to them on my little brothers X-box any time I went home to my parents house. My wife bought me this game so I wouldn't always want to go over and play and it is not near as good. The game is essentially the same, but the graphics aren't nearly as good and I still like to go to my parents house to get my soccer fix from video games. The buttons and game play and action are identical, just those blasted graphics. I wish I would have waited until the new Nintendo comes out this Christmas."
4,Nazgul,"Overall this figure is pretty cool, but his bendy rubber feet and lack of articulation ruin him. You can still find the original Witch-King on Ebay and other places. If you really like this guy, buy him WITH the horse. That is what he is good for."
3,Okay but a little flimsy,We got this armband right away within a few days. Its really tight and its hard to get the Sansa in and out of it. Also after using it for a few weeks my husband noticed that it started to pull apart at the edges. Its okay but I wouldn't recommend it for the money.
2,Broke on first use.,"The armband seems very durable, but on the first attempt to slide my Sansa e250 into the pocket, the reflective striping cracked and broke in 3 places. The actual pocket is made of a really nice stretchy material, but the outer covering has no give."
3,Good for a primer,"This book is OK for a basic understanding of the subject. However, it is dated material going back to circa 1944. Being refurbished and ""updated"" in 1989. Technology has really advanced over the last 20 years. Also the book has many address and websites that are no longer valid.It is not all bad; there is much useful information to get your creative juices going, especially when it comes to deciding what to grow."
2,Oneida-Michaelangelo,"Well, I was looking for something ornate...that it is....I wanted something ""made in the USA""...that it wasnt.....with all the reviews about ""visiting the plant in NY"", the ""thank goodness they are not shipping out their product overseas""...in my case mine was clearly marked ""Indonesia""....my heart sunk .....I was replacing a plainer pattern by Lenox...which I love but wanted a flashier pattern....this is not for me....I suppose I was just so used to the ""european, Hotel"" size and weight......while it is mighty pretty it now feels as if it's Barbie flatware...the dinner fork is smaller that my salad fork of Lenox...I will keep it boxed up and maybe one day drag it out of the attic for the annual neighborhood yard sale...BAM, for all the bad press sent ...wasnt that far off the mark...read my other reviews...I am not hard to please...I hate my disappointed more than they do!"
1,So confused!!!,"This is not a review but an attempt to gather more info on this flatware set prior to deciding to buy. I have been looking for a pattern such as this for some time and was really considering buying one or two sets until I read the reviews. Yikes..how does anyone arrive at a decision based on these reviews...they are all over the place! Since most of these reviews have been done over the period 2008-2011, it would be helpful if anyone who has purchased this set recently could give an updated review. There also seems to be some confusion as to where they are manufactured--USA or overseas. As I have discovered, the quality diminishes with most products manufactured overseas so I definitely don't want to waste my money."
1,Pure knock-off,"This is plated with what looks like stainless 10/18, and is sort of like the real deal but from the box to the pieces a real phony!!!"
3,"looks great, but a little thin","These look great, and everyone who seems them comments on how fancy they are. However, they're pretty light and thin, so they don't ""feel"" all that great."
3,Their weight feels really cheap.,The design is beautiful but when you pick them up they feel cheap and light (almost like aluminum) . It is the closest thing I found to what I want without going Silver but I can't get over the cheap feel.
2,Had some manufacturing flaws.,"Upon inspecting this set of flatware, I noticed that the manufacture had cut the forks a bit off center and the design was not the same on all the pieces. Some had a raised design and some did not. This may be intentional but did not seem to work well as a set."
5,Energized !,"Afrika meets Santana...live !This is a amazing second album from Ayibobo!The musicians in this band have their roots in Haiti & New York, but the music on this livealbum gets its spirit from Afrika, Jazz and rock.Lots of drums and vocals propels the music forward in polyrythms, topped by Jean-Paul Bourelly's awesome high-octane guitarfireworks. If you can remain still listening to this, you are made of clay...Fans of Santana or Bob Marley will get blasted away here !You can read more here: http://www.bourelly.com/ayibobo3.shtm"
1,Terrible country Goth,These guys are terrible - I've bought their cd on the basis of songs that have appeared on compilations and I would have to say that I've been duped. They have three good songs and none of them are here. Avoid at all costs
5,Excelente !,"Este es un super libro , yo admiro mucho al Padre Alberto , me encantan sus programas y los consejos que èl nos brinda son muy sabios. Les recomiendo este libro para poder forjar una buena relaciòn sentimental y este libro es una magnifica herramienta para lograrlo. Dios les bendiga !"
1,Buy a different thermometer,"The thermometer seems to read accurately enough, but like the others have said, the clip is flimsy, thin metal that only lasts for maybe one use. It isn't strong enough to hold onto the pot. I ended up holding it in place with one ""hot-gloved"" hand and stirring my caramel with the other. It was extremely difficult. I will be throwing this one away and looking for a different one."
3,missing scale,"The theromoter itself doesn't have listings for Soft Boil, Hard Boil, etc. You have to look at the case it comes in to find out the proper temperatures for those areas."
1,Shattered into the candy,"I make toffee all year long. Different kinds, different topping, different levels of crunch. I have been searching for a new candy thermometer since mine got lost in our last move. My husband found this one and was so excited to give it to me because I'd been searching for quite a while. I used it once and it was inaccurate and my toffee was too soft. I tried again and the thermometer cracked in the heat (at only 200) and shattered into the candy!!! It is hollow glass and, I guess, just couldn't stand up to the job."
2,glass broke,Worked well until I noticed the glass was broke along the base. I recommend something more durable. I don't recall it dropping every so not sure why it broke.
2,accurate but flimsy,"So far it's been accurate. All my candies are spot on as far as temperature. But it's flimsy. Doesn't like to clip to the pot and frequently falls from the boiling of the syrups, especially if you are using a small pot. Should've spent more and gotten another Taylor thermometer. The black numbers rubbed off of that one but it was accurate and very sturdy!"
2,Flimsy pot attachment,The pot clip is very flimsy and I had to fight with it the whole time I was cooking to keep it upright on the pot. But the temperature gauge must be accurate because my fudge turned out great!
2,"Decent Thermometer, Bad Clip","I also found the clip on this thermometer to be very flimsy. So flimsy that it can't support the weight of the thermometer, which is fairly light! A thermometer doesn't do much good when the end of it is actually resting at the bottom of the pan. For that reason, I would have a hard time recommending this thermometer, although I will say that it seems to be fairly accurate otherwise."
5,frying perfection,I wondered why my fried foods were never as crispy as they should have been. Turns out my fryer was 35 degrees off. Now that I have a good thermometer my fried chicken is again perfect. thanks
2,Will not buy again,This was good and useful as long as it lasted. I have used it about 4-5 times while frying.Last time I used it..the thermometer just snapped at the base where the mercury bulb attaches to the glass tube. Luckily the mercury did not spill out. I guess at its price it gave me enough service.
5,Enclosed Deep Fry Thermometer,Had one of these thermometers before. Could not find another one in stores. Excellent because it is enclosed. Don't buy one with a removable top because when you try to clean it and it gets wet inside and it will fog up the next time you use it & you can't read it even when you think it is dry. I bought two.
2,save your money and buy a different thermometer,"i found this themometer to be inaccurate and the clip is made from such cheap material that it's not strong enough to hold the thermometer so it slides through it right into the oil, (not a good thing), it's hard to read while bobbing in the fryer."
3,glass came with broken tip,"When I opened the package, the bottom of the glass was already broken and the glass pieces fell on my kitchen floor (which i stepped on a few days later and was bleeding to death...)So before you open your package, please examine it carefully. Mine looked perfectly fine. It was hard to see that the bottom tip was broken unless you look at it carefully before you opened it.I don't know how well it works since I didn't get a chance to use it, but I decided to go for metal tip ones instead."
2,3 way doesn't work,"My water pressure may be to high for the middle option, both the hand shower and the direct shower, to work. If I hold the control in place then both shower heads work, as soon as I release it the valve snaps closed and only the hand shower works. Since I bought it to replace a 3 way valve, two stars."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Well maybe not. However, neither the mathematical methods used nor the algorithms used to implement them are well developed. These fundamental shortcoming when combined with abundant typos and errors in the included code make this book more of a headache than it is worth. Save yourself the pain and skip this one."
2,"Fun for a evening, nothing more","This is a good buy if you just want a simple fun read for an evening, and the cover art and font look great.I don't believe many would find it useful as regards magick.As a story, it is not particularly interesting. The characters in it are flat. The climax of the story occurs a few pages in, and everything comes too easily after that. There is no sense of tension or reward.Finally, I suspect this is not even an old book (is that mean or cold to just say?). Not that I would know, but it had the feel of being written in the 1970's by an American to fill up the shelves in occult shops. If this is not the case, my apologies for being misleading in my review. I simply noticed no evidence that this is old. Nothing wrong with this - I think it's legitimate to try to create old style books, but I think somebody buying it with the hopes of obtaining a genuinely old grimoire should be skeptical."
4,Different then most but a joy.,Being a book of magical talismans it is very different since it is written as a story. The main character goes thrue a journey to meat with many different angels to get the secrets to everything in forms of talismans and rings. In a way the journey is like a magical initiation much like the abramelin rite.The reason why I only give it four stars instead of five is because its origin is very questionable. It is mentioned in other grimoires and parts of it is even published in other MSS that are quite old so perhaps it is a valid magical text. Either way it is an interesting story and I enjoyed it.
4,Most underrated album ever,"Maybe unrecognized would be a better word since this sold under 10,000 copies. Every track is solid and if you are looking for something to get you angry as hell and pumped up look no further. After you listen to this you will go do all the things you were too much of a pansy to do before.If you are into metal or hardcore punk, purchase this immediately and you can thank me later."
4,Worth it,"If you like Jasta & Hatebreed then you'll like this one. It's not as complete as a Hatebreed release but pretty close. ""Onward to Victory"" is amazing and ""Tomorrow is not a Promise"" rocks hard with a great guitar hook."
4,Pretty brutal and killer grooves,"Got this record yesterday and it's pretty infectious. Catchy vocals, but Danny Diablo does get a little annoying. I'm a big Hatebreed/Jasta fan, but the guitars and drums groove hard. Seemless drummer Derek Kerswill (who seems to be the Mike Patton of the drumming world at the moment) pounds out killer grooves with producer/guitarist Zeuss. Zeuss's production skills have improved drastically. Bottom line: way solid. This same team is involved with the Kingdom Of Sorrow project. With the addition of Kirk Windstein of Down and minus Danny Diablo, I can't even imagine how great that record will be. Hurry the f*ck up Jasta."
2,Just a pamphlet ?,"This book is little more than a brochure. More information is available by just browsing the Net for ""Enduro"". The book contains information like ""riders may even have to ride over rocks and hills"", and sentences like ""The suspension system is the system of springs and shocks on a motorcycle"". You won't learn much by buying this book."
2,ll550p 50 male plug,"Bought the Reliance LL550P 50 along with Reliance LL550C 50, after 1/2 hr. of trying to getthem to connect i had to take the male(LL550P) apart and file the prongs an hour later theywent to-gether,even then it a very rough (grinding)connection."
3,Doesn't quite work.,"These don't quite work with my ballet flats. They're comfy, but they aren't low enough so you can always see the socks, which is not the look I was going for. I'm tired of fighting with them to stay in place and stop them from riding up after I pull them down so you can't see them, so I don't bother wearing socks with my shoes anymore."
4,Good Bowling Ball Bag,Good Bowling Ball BagShoe pockets on both sides and a foam insert to hold the ball in place.Well made bag
3,Good bag for the price,"I found this bag for under $25, for the price it meets my needs for carrying my bowling ball. I could have just put a foam liner in one of my gym bags it I thought about it. I like the room that it has for shoes and extra stuff but the bag does not hold it's shape well and I don't think it will be my last bag that I buy. Again, for the price and the room for shoes and extras, it's not a bad bowling bag."
4,Very Nice Bag great quality!,Purchased for my son for a Birthday Gift this bag is just what I was looking for..the shoe section holds up to a size 15 shoe..which is hard to find since he wears a size 14...Quality of the bag was good...only thing I would say was a bit expensive was the shipping..other then that...I was very happy with my purchase.
3,bowling ball tote bag by Brunswick,Bowling ball tote bag by Brunswick needs more interior/all sides padding to protect bowling ball. There is only padding at base of bag. Bag is well constructed.
4,Really good product,"This bowling bag is a good quality product. It has zippered pockets on both sides for carrying shoes, towels, etc. It also has a zippered pocket in the front for papers and the such. I probably would have given it a five star rating except the the ball holder is foam instead of a hard plastic. Also, the shipping cost was rather high."
2,Somewhat satisfied,"The bag looks great, until you pick it up with a ball in it. I has no bottom or side support so it looks and feels like you are carrying the ball in a sling. It has a small pocket for rings, watches and other small items and two large compartments on each end of the bag. Both compartments are large enough for a pair of size 11 shoes. It's a very roomy bag, it just looks crappy when you are carrying it. This is a case where you get what you pay for."
5,Very Pleased!,"I purchased this as a gift for our daughter's boyfriend. Not being a bowler myself, I took a chance on this as I wasn't sure if this would meet his needs. He uses it regularly and said it suits his needs perfectly. He is very pleased with the quality and ruggedness of it."
5,Given as a gift,Given to granddaughter as a Christmas gift...she was pleased and the bag work great.More than enough room for ball and extra items. Appears to be made well.It has already helped her bowling score.
4,Good starter bag for the price,"If you're just beginning to carry around your own ball and shoes, this little bag is great. I was concerned initially about the bag being flimsy, but have found it to actually be quite stable as long as the ball is inside of it. There is an indented piece of styrofoam at the bottom of the bag to hold the ball in place, and it does a surprisingly good job of it. The pockets on the sides fit my size 11 shoes easily, and the front pouch is perfect for a rosin bag or a wrist support. This bag also has an adjustable shoulder strap, which is a great feature to have to keep your hands free."
2,Color much brighter,"This showed up very vibrant... looks like a maroon in the photo, when it arrived it was more shinny thus looking more like bright red."
3,Entertaining,"This book starts off with a bang, but really takes a left turn into an area that is so unrealistic and immature. It is, however, entertaining"
1,YAWN,"I struggled through two chapters, telling myself this book is going to get better. I guess I was anticipating something along the lines of Marian Keyes or Helen Fielding. What a disappointment! How did this book get published? Moreover, too bad I can't get my money back. Does make a nice window prop though."
1,Just too much............................,"Big pink book, big writing, lines not too close together, a story that transcends the believable and takes the reader into the realms of unimaginable fantasy - the perfect combination to attract little girls learning to read........or is it Honeymoon? Could be both. A contrived fairytale of the modern day - Honey re-meets the love of her life in a country she's not actually supposed to be in (America) on a hotel balcony on, of all things, her ""honeymoon"" (except she was supposed to spend her honeymoon in Mexico). The characters are almost without exception quite unbelievable (Theresa being the exception?), I felt no sympathy, empathy, admiration, pity or dislike, they were quite untouchable. Such a let down after the compulsive viewing that was ""This Life"", I think Amy Jenkins should stick to screen plays."
1,A Tremendous Disappointment,"I began this book with great expectation. After all, the premise is compelling. The book turned out to be a complete disappointment. While it is obvious that the author can, indeed, write, she did not make much effort with this novel. The characters all were dislikable, to be kind, except for the heroine's poor fiance, who just was a jerk. The story was full of holes. How did the heroine's sister realize that her sibling's long-lost mystery love was a man whom she just had met if they didn't know his last name? The best thing that can be said about the whole book is that it was short. In a better work, I might have felt cheated by the length but, here, it was an assist. I couldn't read anymore of it."
2,Not So Hot,As a left hander I didn't find a difference in these scissors. THey don't do a very good job cutting either.
3,Save Your Money,I compared these scissors to a right hand pair and could find no difference but the price. Save your money and buy a cheap pair at your local store.
2,Didn't hold up like I thought.,"About a year ago I purchased a men's rain coat, price was right but recently washed it for the 3rd time and it basically fell apart. Now I am sure it won't keep me dry. It was washed as directed and just fell apart."
3,Logo ruins it,"It does as good as what it is, a very lightweight compressible rain shield for unencumbered roaming, and it is slightly roomier then Red Ledges from many years ago. However, unlike the old Red Ledge, it has a very prominent logo,(""Red Ledge"", spelled out) 3"" long, 3/4"" high, on left chest, something the main picture here in blue doesn't show accurately. Gee I wonder why? It's not just the depicted tiny white square. Hate to be a walking advertisement, so will not buy 2 or 3 just to have different colors. At least it looks pressed on, instead of sewn, like some, so maybe it will come off eventually or is removable. Anyone know how without destroying structure?"
2,Last about 5 times in the rain- then leaks,"I used this coat about 5 time in hard rain, after that my arms started to get wet, so I can't give this coat any good reviews."
1,This book is quite informative but...,"All the reviews of this book that I read included the words ""Well written"". This book has a good language, and includes good information on several parts of the world. But it still lacks something. I believe that Hamish McRae has not put enough stress on some very important economic regions, such as South East Asia (the Indian SubContinent), Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa. The only reason why that could be is because of incomple research. This lets the readers draw wrong conclusions about these parts. I would not recommend this book to a friend or use it for any sort of research."
1,"PAINFUL, in every sense of the word!!!!!!!","MADE ME WANT TO KILL MYSELF!!! After spending,HOURS with assembly that basically started with me cutting down a tree for the wood, I decided to take it apart and return it to the store. No wonder they don't let you try it out before you buy it! My husband recommended a plan to fix it that involved using a permanent vice grip. And those instructions!! I read through them over and over again and finally decided to give up because it was to difficult to understand (and I have a Masters Degree!). Also, here's a direct quote from my husband: ""Squeezing that handle sucks so f***ing bad!"" Tell you neighbors, friends, & relatives to run from this product!!!!"
1,This is a terrible gate.,"I bought this gate because we have a unique space at the bottom of our stairs and liked that it had extensions. However, after it was bought and installed I tried to open it and had a very diffcult time. There is no way I could open this gate with a baby in my arms. Also, the other aspect I don't like is when the gate is open it stays to the size of the opening. I am very unhappy with this gate and will not use it."
2,Not that great,"I bought this gate in February! Its now June of the same year. The handle where you have to squeeze the 2 little buttons together is cracked and almost everytime we open this gate 1 of the little buttons gets stuck and you have to use all the stregnth you have in your fingers plus some to even try to fix it. I have never had the problem of it just falling open. My daughter shakes it silly and it has never come open. I did call evenflo and they are going to replace it, although i have had another problem with my stroller and will never buy evenflo again!!"
1,Don't waste your time & money!,"We bought this gate because we have a wide opening at the top of our stairs. This gate took 3 hours to install using the directions and templates. After all the hassle installing it doesn't swing right and the ""one hand latch"" is terrible! It takes two hands and you have to lift up on the gate to get it to latch. Everytime you open the gate you have to readjust so it will close again. This was a complete waste of money and time! I don't feel this gate will be safe since it doesn't latch properly. We are going to purchase a new gate this weekend already. I want my money back!"
1,Piece of junk,"Hard to install, ridiculously confounding installation directions, and when you're done, it's flimsy. Don't waste your money."
4,Great Gate = Great Value,"The gate works wonderfully. Not very hard to install, just follow the instructions and take your time. Be sure you measure accurately and use their math formula to figure out where to connect the gate together."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GATE!,I purchased this gate because we needed one that opened and also would work for wide spaces. Not only can my son open it (he was 7 months old when we purchased it) by leaning on it but to make matters worse the gate fell apart this time and fell on him. I had already called Evenflo and they said that was the first time they had heard that a child could lean on it and it popped open. They said they would send us a new one. After another week or so with the old gate it when it completely fell part and fell on top of my little boy. I called Evenflo again because I had not received the new gate and told them that under no circumstances did I want the same gate again. This is a piece of CRAP! and Evenflo needs to address the lack of safety associated with this gate before someone is really hurt.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"This gate took my husband and I almost 2 hours to install. Then once you make 8 holes in your walls, you find out it is the most difficult gate to open, and the latch is a piece of garbage. The most frustrating part is that after you finally install it and realize you hate it and you have put so much time and energy into it - not to mention its now attached to your walls - - you don't want to return it and start over...."
2,"Unfortunately, best thing I could find.","This is the only gate I could find that would fit at the top of a staircase that is more than 60"" wide, and does not go straight across. It started out easy to install, until you get to the point where you have to measure the length of the gate. I ended up less than 1/8"" off in my measurement, and the gate would not close! I had to do that entire part over. Once assembled, the locking mechanism is still quite difficult to use, especially if the gate and the wall are not at a perfect 90 degree angle.One important note: There is NO WAY I would use this at the top of the stairs without fastening the the ""foot"" to the floor. The manuafacturer does not provide any hardware or instructions for this, but if you are stuck using this gate you should really add that step to the installation."
3,"Nice Gate but, needs work","I have now had this gate for 2 months. I would like to recommend the gate but I have frustrations with it. When installing the gate I recommend that you screw the plastic platform to the floor, otherwise it will not be very secure. Also if you are going through the gate alot you will find that the plastic latch that you open it with will wear out and break. One of the main reason I thought I would purchase more of an expensive gate was I thought it would last longer. I was wrong. I like the gate I wish it would last longer."
1,do not buy,We have had this gate only a couple months and it has fallen apart. I am now shopping for a new one. Big waste of money.
1,buy the configure gate instead,This gate is horrible to try to open and close... don't try to pinch pennies when it's your little one's safety and YOUR convenience at stake. Buy the Configure Gate instead... you'll be glad you did. It is well worth every penny... this one isn't worth a thing.
1,Need a new gate,"Got back online to research getting a new gate. Then saw the gate we just installed, decided to let others know, it is very ineffecient. It is hard to get it to lock and unlock, its wobbly, and the babies I have 2 can open it quicker than I can."
1,"Don't buy this , it is horriable to install and not strong","It took me a long time to install this gate. You will need drills and what have you to do the installation. Also installing it requires precision. For example, to adjust the length you need to to move some stuff 24.234 inches. Can you believe that ?. How can measure inces to the 100th decimal point . I am not sure how on earth did the reviewer say it is easy to install ?. I would advise the reviewr to give it a try first. Also, after installing it the gate wables a lot. I am returing this product back."
1,RECALL ME!!!!,"I am horrified! This gate is ridiculous! It is severly substandard. I thank God that I didn't install this at the top of stairs. Besides the general structure is unstable, the latch is a joke! My 16 mth old pushes on it and it pops open! Fat lot of good that's doing for me! Why bother having it at all? I bought this because I have the original Swing Gate, which is wonderful, but this doesn't even come close in comparison. A recall of this extremely dangerous gate would be doing everyone, including Evenflo, a favor. Evenflo is putting their name and reputation at risk by selling such a pathetic excuse for a safety item. It's a shame you can't give negative stars here."
1,not safe unstable,"We have a 78"" opening and thought there was no other option the foot is useless and the whole gate is flimsy. i could push it open with one finger it is a dangerous horrible product and should be recalled."
1,Terrible product - avoid,"As another reviewer noted, the screws come apart when the gate is being assembled. If this company uses such cheap screws, I can only imagine what the rest of the gate -- something designed to protect children -- is like.Do not buy! Do not buy!"
1,!#@$%!@$!!!,"I wish that we had read the reviews for this item before we bought it! While my husband was putting this gate together, the heads of 2 of the screws came off, leaving the rest of the screw in the gate. Installation is almost impossible. My husband has, in the past 5 minutes, threatened to take the thing outside and burn it.Do not buy this item!"
4,"Fantastic gate, ""hard to install/use"" is an understatement","For the money, it has done it's job through two kids. Okay, three did the job through two kids. Looking back on how much we've spent replacing it because of a broken panel (fastener failed when our 1st daughter was about 18 months old--she was quite the ""shaker"") and a broken latch (again, the first daughter, but now she's 3, and we'll be replacing it again because of our 2nd 18 month daughter), I'm amazed I'm willing to keep replacing it.Alas, there isn't another out there for the width I need! If there is a better door out there that will span 60"" without falling in and lets me walk through rather than over, I'd love to buy it! In the meantime, it's not the strongest, so be prepared to buy a few of them, but they do the job well. If it was made of steel, it would be absolutely perfect!"
1,Have had it for over a year and never been satisfied.,"Bought this gate and the extensions to fit a wide space. Could not set it up straight across so had to put a V shape in order to cross the space. It held up for a couple of months, but always was moveable and the latch never worked without forcing the gate upward. Also, gate has to attach to a wall so need the right opening for it. To date we use zip ties to hold it together and have put L brackets on it. We are shopping for another already as this one keeps falling apart. We've glued and reglued the dowels, but because of it's mobility it just keeps coming undone. Not the best gate for wide openings."
1,Junk,"This gate is a piece of junk! My three year old AND my one year old can open it just by pulling on it. After about 6 months of use, this gate started to sag. One day my three year old was opening it, and it just broke off the wall. This gate is worthless and definately dangerous. It should be recalled!!!"
2,Adequate... for my purposes,"The problems I had with this gate:1. The instructions for using the template to install the hinges, for the fixed gate, was not easy to understand. I finally gave up and I improvised. Doing so, the installation went more smoothly.2. The gate is not sturdy. If anyone were to bump into it, I'm pretty sure it would break.3. The mechanism to click/unclick the lock is more difficult than it should be. Fortunately, the people who will using it, have a strong enough grip to get it to work.Despite these flaws, however, this gate does serve its purpose, in my case. I bought this gate to keep my dogs confined to a room --- which it does. They don't go near the gate, so fortunately, I don't have to worry about them leaning on, or jumping on, it. As for the locking mechanism, it's annoying, and I'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse.This gate would not be safe for kids!"
1,Buyer beware,"The Gate and Customer Service Stink. As you've read the gate doesn't work. I think the people who are using this gate successfully didn't add the extra piese to expand it. Once oyu do that, there is too much play in the gate and it doesn't stay locked. Plus, try to open it with one hand. Ha Ha. Here's what Evenflo had to say when I called: i called them thinking there was a recall on it (it was that bad) and they said the gates weren't meant for babies or toddlers to handle. i am suppose to teach him to dtay away from it. Well, if it was that easy, I would not need the gate at all. I could just tell my nine month old son to stay away from the stairs!"
1,THIS GATE IS HORRIBLE,"I must say, I didn't believe the negative reviews at first. This gate is horrible. At first I tried installing it at the top of the stairs. It is so wobbly and doesn't stay locked, I figured it was the confirguration I was using. So, I tried mounting it in a wide, but straight doorway. It's awful. Despite the holes in my walls, this gate is going back. It's not safe and should not be on the market. If the baby leans on the gate it opens and forget trying to get it open. It's impossible. It's too difficult to squeeze and open with one hand. Probably because you don need too, it opens by pushing on it instead (it shouldn't). Do your self a favor and try another wide space gate on the market. BRU carries it it's the same price as this one plus an expansion. Evenflo has to do a better job. By the way, I wouldn't give this gate any stars at all, if that was an option."
1,Needed testing,"It was a good idea, but someone forgot to do a usability test, and the end result is a piece of junk. The gate attaches directly to the wall, which makes it both unstable and difficult to latch. Needs work."
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY,We bought two of these gates with two extensions each. The screw heads came apart from the screws with minimal force. Even when Evenflo sent us replacement gates those too had the same problem. Also - very difficult to use with baseboards. We were very disappointed.
1,Flimsy gate,"This gate has a very poorly made latching mechanism. It gets looser with time. My 17 month old has somehow opened it several times, I guess by pushing on it. My DOG, a golden retriever opens the gate quite frequently when we go out. I have seen her pawing at the bottom of the gate, so I assume it opens when she pulls downward. Also, if we accidently push the gate so it swings in the other direction, we practically have to break it to get it back to the other side. I'm sure it will break entirely very soon. If you want a cheap wide gate, try supergate V. Ugly but sturdy."
1,Waste of time and money,"We bought this and one extension to fit on our wide wall opening. First of all, some parts (screws, nails etc) are either wrong or missing, and we saw some pre-screwed holes on the gate, meaning it must be used and returned be someone else (which I wouldn't blame them). My husband spent like 4 hrs to put this together, following the lousy written instructions - they expect you to be extremely precise when putting them together but their parts are made nothing close to precise. The first inspection by our major user - our 9 month-old boy, was failed instantly. It took only a slight pull from his little hands to make it collapse, thanks to the ""careful"" design of the supports of the gate. We returned everything and bought another remote controlled gate from evenflo. That one works out quite well so far."
1,We are returning this gate,"This gate is incredibly difficult to install and is not very sturdy. After three hours of drilling, measuring, etc. my husband and I and have decided to return this item. We followed every step of the directions and ended up with a gate that was not sturdy. Even with the stabilizer foot I did not get the impression that the gate would hold up to the wear and tear of a soon to be walking baby. Additionally, the gate is not very easy to open and close. Unless you are the engineering type, I would suggest buying another gate for your wide space."
1,Don't waste your money,"This gate is absolutely worthless. If I could give it zero stars, I would. It was difficult to install and is very flimsy. I have it at the top of the stairs and I don't trust that it will hold at all. I hate that I spent so much on the gate and now I have to purchase another one."
4,Tough to install but a great gate,"We have a open living room/dining room/kitchen set-up and we wanted our son to be able to play in the living room but to stay out of the dining room/kitchen. The opening we needed to gate off is 107 inches and this was the only gate (wide spaces gate and 3 extentions) we could find that did the trick and we didn't have to spend a small fortune on. Because of the add-on panels adjustable bracket feature I can have it set up so that the gate curves around the end of the dining room table. I can also remove the whole gate in about a second without any tools when entertaing guests.When I tried to install this gate it took me 3 hours and I still needed to call my hasband to help a few times. It's impossible to do alone. For this reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5.I have been using this gate every day, multiple times a day, for 6 mths now and it has never fallen on my son even with him shaking it like crazy. I love it and highly recommend it."
2,"Good gate, lousy latch","This is a well-built gate, but the latch can be defeated by pulling the gate straight out from the wall. So if gate set-up has any curve in it any toddler can pop the latch free with a vigorous shaking. A hook and eye can hold it closed but it can still be twisted enough to make an opening.I kept the extension panels and replaced the gate with an Evenflo Swing Gate (the one for stairs). This has a good latch that's holding up nicely. But I wound up tossing out most of the $40 Swing-wide kit."
4,I must be lucky,"We had two of these gates and absolutely loved them. They were the only ones we found that worked for our space that didn't look plastic and cheap. Our kids climbed on them, hung on them, we slammed them shut, etc., and after two years of heavy use I just sold them at a garage sale. Go figure. Maybe some of them just weren't installed correctly? Screwed into studs? hmmmm...."
2,What-Happened?,"This album is nothing like thier first one. The mexican style is gone from them it seems, also they changed thier singer from Tito on most of the songs. They sound like Los Lobos now. Not Tito & Tarantula."
2,Not as good as they were,I previously owned a pair of these scissors and thought they were the best scissors made. With that in mind i ordered a few more pair and found that the new version is substantially inferior to the old pair. The were not created to cut against each other but rather to cut beside each other which allows thicker material to open the blades and be trapped between rather than being cut. They are also quite a bit lighter in weight and therefore making it easier for material to spread them apart and avoid being cut.
5,Great Scissors - and Great Customer Service!,"I got a pair of these because I have an 8 1/2"" pair and couldn't resist the price for the 9 1/2"". The 8 1/2"" are still my favorite, but only because the 9 1/2"" are substantially heavier scissors. They are great for cutting heavy fabric, etc. They come with a lifetime warranty and they stand behind it - great customer service!"
3,Scholarly book,Scholarly and biased look at Big Band Jazz focusing mainly on the Negro Jazz bands of the period. Tedious read that focuses too much on band personnel and changes. Book not only describes the primary bands of the time but also the many territory bands that never recorded discs. The book is a bit unbalanced and biased as white bands are often derided and given shortshrift for their contributions to the genre-the white bands do receive a chapter though.Book would have been better served if it would describe in detail more of the Negro bands trial and tribulations touring in the South and providing more antedotes of the period in terms of how recordings were made and the atmosphere and stories of various nightclubs-speakeasies of which most were owned by gangsters.
4,A very pleasant jazz-rock album,"This is Lucifer's Friend's best album. It will probably not appeal to fans of their first album, though; whereas that album was pure metal in the Zeppelin vein, _Banquet_ is an excursion into jazz fusion. The two best tracks here are conceptual pieces that feature a 30-piece backup jazz band and are both over 10 minutes in length: ""Sorrow"" and ""Spanish Galleon"". These tracks are surrounded by shorter pieces, the best of which is probably the radio-friendly ""High Flying Lady - Goodbye"", which has the feel of rockabilly with horns. Easily their most progressive album, and the one example of where this band's output actually matched their artistic intentions."
4,better than Grease in my opinion,i like this movie better than Grease. Most people i talk to don't share my view. it's a matter of opinion i guess.
3,It's OK!,"Well....it's OK.Balanchine was beloved by thousands, probably millions, and I am one of them.Kinda dull in spots.....better in others."
3,some mistake,"I can not know if I like it, because it is in another format, that is able just in USA and not in Europe! I didn't know that :("
1,For Trivia Lovers Only,"I'm not a worshiper of Balanchine. Sometimes his work is magnificent, sometimes his work is uninspired, often he is the Busby Berkeley of Ballet. I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about ballet, more about Balanchine. I learned two things -- one, letting people go along with traveling ballet companies with video recorders should be outlawed; two, if you put your mind to it you can make any subject boring and irrevalent. New York City Ballet and Peter Martens, one of my favorite dancers, should never have allowed this travesty to see the light of day. Both ballet and Balanchine deserve better."
2,Not quite what I expected,I didn't really like this DVD. It is great if you are looking for a very true documentary that chronicles the life and work of Balanchine. I was hoping for more behind the scenes look of the ballet dancers practicing Balanchine's ballets. Maybe more interviews and following the ballet dancers with their daily routines.
3,"Readable, but not essential reading.",There's really no good insider showbiz tips or amazing gossip here. I found the book to be readable -- meaning I kept on reading once I picked it up but at any time I could have stopped and not felt like I was going to be missing a golden nugget.It's a show biz biography of a manager. Did we really expect it to be an essential read?
2,Too bad Brillstein is not the man he portrays himself as.,"Brillstein portrays himself as a one man show, taking credit most recently for ""The Sopranos."" Where was his partner Brad Gray? Taking a cat nap?"
2,A poorly edited book,"Great stories from a showbiz legend, but where was the editor? I found myself frustrated by the author's wonderful voice struggling to rise to the surface of this disorganized, lazy mess. The book feels a little like a first draft to this reader (though I'm not in the film business, so maybe this is just the way they write out there). This is a great shame because I have a feeling Mr. Brillstein would be tremendously entertaining around a dinner table (if he just left his dimwitted editor at home!)For an ultimately more satisfying read,I would suggest the William Goldman memoir or the recent John Irving book about film adaptations. With these books, somebody else has already separated the wheat from the chaff, so you don't have to!"
3,"Some parts good, others kind of drone along","Bernie Brillstein had an interesting career and worked with many well known stars and characters. When he's talking about them, it's a good book. When he drones on about the business and where it's going (this book is from 1999 so some of it is dated), it drags a bit. I'd still recommend it with a minor warning about the end of it."
4,"Best Hollywood read since ""The Kid Stays In The Picture""","For those of us hooked on ""The E True Hollywood Story,"" ""VH1's Behind The Music"" and other outlets for real life Hollywood dish, Bernie Brillstein's book is a wonderful treat. This is a candid, honest look at a half-century long career in the trenches. Bernie Brillstein nurtured the careers of Lorne Michaels,Jim Henson, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, and many more icons. Besides the wonderful stories (ok, dish) about his clients, Brillstein shares behind the scenes anecdotes from the deal making trenches. Great insights for any future Hollywood agents/managers. But even if you don't work in this town, you will love Bernie's story and possibly pick up some useful life lessons. An appealing, infinitely readable Hollywood read, and if you like this, check out books by Bob Evans and Ken Kragen!"
1,Not worth your time to even consider,"This product is very low quality. Poor materials and bad manufacturing come together to make a frustratingly awful tool. I have attempted to use the various attachments on different parts and it has never worked. Pieces bend, bits of metal chip off. I finally threw it away in frustration without having successfully pulled anything. Do not waste your time, money or sanity on this piece of junk. This should be re-branded as hot air balloon ballast, paper weights or a prop for a short table leg. It would be more useful for anything else than a bearing puller. Stay away!"
3,Useful but a battery hog.,"We have had this remove now several years. The setup is fairly easy. But we have found that we use it mainly to turn the TV, audio, tivo, vcr, dvd on in the right combination for the viewing we want to do.But after getting them on, I find I go the to remote control for the device I am using (VCR, DVD, TIVO)as they are better configured to handle the commands.The Harmony device Play/Fast Forward etc buttons are inconveniently located at the bottom of the remote, so if you hold the remote in the middle where it is designed to be held, you need to use your second hand to push these controls.It also seems to use up batteries (4 AAA) quickly. Tonight even new batteries don't bring my remote back to life."
1,Did not stack up,"I thought this remote would be the answer I was looking for to control all of my components but I was very disappointed. I could not get the ""Watch TV"" and ""Watch a Movie"" buttons to function properly. Just about every time I would press one of the buttons the remote would fail to turn on one of my components (usually the cable box).I was constantly going back to the setup menu to reprogram it and change delay times. After a week of this I went back to using the individual remotes."
5,Logitech Harmony SST-659 Remote Control,"The Logitech Harmony SST-659 is a great product. Eliminates the need for multiple remotes. No more fumbling around to set the correct video input, receiver input, VCR, etc. Setup on the PC was easy. My wife was against buying it saying it cost too much (about $100). Now she wouldn't give it up. Would recommend to all. May need to look at other Logitech models if you have a satellite dish or DVR. Other models are designed to handle them better. Would definately buy again."
1,Warning on warranty,"WARNING: If your purchase a Harmony remote control from Amazon the manufacture of the Harmony remote Intrigue Technologies will NOT honor the warranty on the remote control unit. They claim that Amazon is a ""unauthorized on-line E-tailer"". We purchased a Harmony remote on Amazon and it is defective and Intrigue Technologies will not repair it under warranty. They told me that their web site states that Harmony remotes purchase from a ""unauthorized on-line E-tailer"" are not covered and that we should of checked their web site for warranty coverage before purchasing this item. Well duh, how many times have you gone to a manufactures web site to check on warranty coverage before purchasing an item? This a lame warranty policy that screws the buyer, beware. It is a problem with Intrigue Technologies not Amazon."
4,Backlight failed way too quickly,"This is a great remote, but the glow light to light up the lcd screen and buttons failed within the first couple of months (and out of the warranty). I contacted tech support but they were gonna charge me an arm and a leg to fix it. Now I can't see the LCD screen in the dark. This and the fact that not all of my components turn on all of the time in the right order, etc. are my only gripes about the remote. It is great otherwise, but to get it working right requires a lot of tweaking."
3,An OK remote.,"I'm not sure if I'm happy with this product or not. I've had it now for aprox 3 hours. I have an Olevia 32"" LCD HDTV which I cannot get the Harmony SST-659 to operate properly. I've tried using the online database and also IR learning mode. So far no luck. Basically I can get it to turn my TV on and off. I've emailed Tech support for help but have yet to get a response. Other items that I put on the remote control seem to work fine including a Panasonic DVD Recorder, Directv, Sanyo VCR and a Samsung DVD Home Theater. Button placement is ok, overall it's a nice remote, however it's not really serving the purpose if it's not going to control the TV."
5,A reasonably priced USB Remote that works,"With 5 remote on the table things were getting out of hand, and the wife was getting downright hostile.Tried a Sony AV3100 but it was too difficult to set up with my equipment.The 659 is a breeze. 95% of the set up was done with the USB, minor troubleshooting and 2 learning functions later and it was good to go.1 button and the DVD is on, a 2nd button and you can switch to HDTV, or the tuner etc.With one button, it turns on the components, selects the inputs while sit back and relaxI just ordered 2 more. One for my mother who is hopeless at getting her system working, she can never remember which remote does what.Manual does not have alot of information, but there is a downloadable manual available. I downloaded it but did not need it. Need phone support, the people at Logitech are top notch, quick answers and very pleasant and helpful."
4,It's good enough,"I bought it because it was being offered at a great price. The remote works well to control all my components but it has its quirks. I find myself having to press the help button often when the remote forgets to shut off the TV. Though, I have been too lazy to call up Logitec's customer service to see if there is a more permanent fix. Also, it would have been nice to include designated DVR buttons like the higher end models, but it isn't too much of a pain especially considering the price I paid ($50)"
5,fast response and delivery,ordered this dvd on a saturday evening received on the following wednesday. good old classic western.
3,"Not all his best films, but worthwhile as a set of different roles","Paul Newman was versatile and this set amply demonstrates that - I like the two Harper films mostly (Harper, The Drowning Pool) and the espionage thriller 'The Mackintosh Man'. The biopic 'Somebody' was successful in that it showed Paul's range, but I don't return to it. I haven't watched the other films and am in no particular hurry to do so.Everyone has their favourite Newman films, but for me, only 'Harper' has joined that list as a result of buying this set, along with 'Butch', 'The Sting', 'The Verdict', 'Nobody's Fool' and 'Cool Hand Luke'.If you are able to rent some of the other included films and/or read reviews of them, you may then be able to make a more informed choice on whether to purchase this set - perhaps buying used would be the way to go, as I did."
3,Gore Vidal Resented Penn and this Movie Everafter,"One interesting factoid missing in these reviews about this movie: screenwriter Gore Vidal's loathing for the movie and, especially, for the Director Arthur Penn.I've read articles and seen video clips of Vidal, centering on how he thinks Penn destroyed his play and screenplay. Vidal may have a bit of a point almost no one else makes about Penn and his ways, yet this is still a good movie. No doubt, significantly because Paul Newman plays Billy. Newman has always had the way of playing the contemptuous punk with the undertone of dangerous and needy instability.No doubt, the movie also works as another great story of mythic America, recast. No matter what Vidal thinks, he gets some of the credit, too.Interestingly, historians like Robert Utley seem to have proved that Bill was not actually left-handed. The famous picture was printed backwards."
1,Paul Newman Collection,This was purchased as a Christmas present. Unfortuneatly six of the seven DVD's did not have the sound track
4,One of His Best Movies - Some Not So Great,"""Somebody Up There Likes Me"", the movie that made Paul Newman,is included here,along with stylishly dated ""Harper"", and one of thousands (it seems) movies about Billy the Kid, ""The Left-Handed Gun"". The others are typically cool Newman movies. A pretty good collection, but I'd still like to see a box set of his classics."
5,Excellent Grouping of the Many Faces of Newman.,"My wife and I found this excellent collection of character portrayals a real exhibition of Newman's ability to live the parts rather than just acting the parts. As for the purchase, Amazon completed the transaction and delivery in a timely fashion and the quality was every bit as good as promised. I have no qualms about initiating any future purchase action."
4,As Good As It Gets,This boxset of early Paul Newman films is a good example of howto properly assemble a major film star's career works on dvds.It is a valuable boxset at a very reasonable price for the consumers.It does Mr. Newman justice and he ought to be proud.
4,The Left Handed Gun,"The Left Handed Gun, A young Paul Newman. Most Billy The Kid tales that are told via the golden screen, tell somewhat the same story in this case we have a left handed William Bonnie. Paul Newman was and is one of my favorites, this is very good entertainment. ThankYou"
5,Beautiful,"An amazing musician. It's a great price and a wealth of material to enjoy, study and love. Beautiful."
4,Excellent product,"This product is amazing, I recommend it for everyone specially who live in a hot area and have many insects. Try it and you will find a very good result ."
1,Didn't Kill My Bed Bugs!,"I purchased this product to take care of my bed bug problem and decided to give it a real test. I collected a bed bug from a bed in my house. It was the full-grown variety, not to be mistaken for any other bug. I put it in a plastic sandwich bag and sprayed the Ortho product directly on the bug and then sealed the bag shut. The bed bug was still live an kicking after three hours."
3,dont work on roaches,"this doesn't work on roaches may work on other bugs it just makes roaches run to other parts of your house to hide i haven't seen not one dead in fact i see more of them. I have to find another product ive tried a lot so far, enforcer and raid just kills on the spot doesn't seem to keep them gone. tried the DE stuff and it didn't seem to get rid of them just killed a few and made me think i was getting rid of them but ofter i used this stuff it seem to make it worse. thirs gotta be something out there to get roaches out of my kitchen and now bathroom"
1,Waste of money,"First, the packaging. The nozzle became loose in shipping, and when I got it the cardboard box was soaked like it had been in the rain, and half the bottle was gone.As for the half that was left, I might as well have been squirting the flies with a water hose. This is a complete and total waste of money."
1,THE WRONG PRODUCT WAS SENT...FROM ACE HARD WARE.,"YOU KWOW I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM...WITH NATS...IN MY NYC CITY COOP...AND I REALLY NEED THIS PRODUCT...THEY SENT ME THE WRONG ORTHO...I ORDERED ORTHO PRODUCT NO 0195010,,,THAT KILLS NAT AND FLYING INSECT...I CALLED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME TO SEND THE TWO BOTTLES BACK (((AT MY EXPENSE))) HECK NO....AFTER A COUPLE EMAILS I CALLED THEM AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD REFUND MY MONEY BACK TO MY ACCOUNT...WHICH THEY DID....AND TOLD ME TO JUST THROW OUT THE ONES THEY SENT...AND THE PRODUCT I ORDERED WAS DISCONTIUED...WHAT THE HELL...THIS PRODUCT ORTHO DEF MAX #0195010 IS STILL ON LINE HEREALL I CAN SAY IS WHEN DEALING THROUGH AMAZON WATCH OUT WHERE YOUR PRODUCT IS BEING SENT FROM STICK WITH AMAZON...NOW I NEED A SPRAY THAT WILL GET RID OF THESE TINY NATS AND THE MAMA...PLEASE HELP SPRAY NOT A MIXTURE.."
3,Good product but be careful with Toby's Tool Shed,"These wall plates are nice and adequate for the price, but I had a problem with my seller, Toby's Tool Shed. I ordered a single switch plate, but they sent me a triple switch plate instead. I had a great difficulty contacting the seller because they don't respond to emails, and keep disconnecting phone calls. It took many days and frustrating hours before they finally corrected their mistake."
5,Looks like meats back on the Menu!,"This is the same figure that came in the hobbit 2 pack last winter. It is a great figure though; it is a scary bad guy, good for army building as well. My one gripe is that he's a bit difficult to stand up. He has big feet, but it took me awhile to get them lined up properly. He has a sword and whip for accessories, so not too much to get lost or broken. the detailing on these monsters is incredible, so i gave 5* for fun for being a nasty monster,5* educational because it will hopefully get kids to read Tolkein, and 5* durability because of big limbs and few accessories that shouldn't get lost or broken. Great toy!"
5,Very emotional book as it relates to the Vietnam War,"This book was written through the eyes and soul of one Vietnam vet as he faces the daily struggles and tragedies of war. It is very realistic but also very sensitive. After reading this book it is easy to understand how it changed the lives of our young soliders over there and stole their youth. Since Vietnam is the untold story, every American should read this book and give thanks to the Vietnam veterans and the sacrifices they made. I for one believe it is never to late to tell them WELCOME HOME."
4,GREAT FOR PARTIES,"FOR A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE HOT DOG MAKER,YOU GET A GOOD VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY.I'M ACTUALLY ON MY SECOND ONE.I WORE THE 1ST ONE OUT THRU A LOT OF ENTERTAINING.IF YOU USE IT A LOT,THE POSTS THAT HOLD UP THE CANOPY WILL WARP.NOT A BIG PROBLEM.1/2"" COPPER TUBING FITS IN PERFECTLY AND MAKES A HEAT RESISTANT REPLACEMENT.OVERALL A GOOD BUY AND A NICE CONVERSATON PIECE ALSO."
5,Nice little memento,"In fact, too pretty to use for journal-keeping, unless you buy a spare copy to keep pristine! The book is faux-leather-bound, in red, with an elastic band that wraps around, to give the appearance of keeping it shut. The inner pages are parchment-like, with very faint images of the map of Middle Earth background-printed. It's a lovely gift, for a friend - or for yourself."
4,Great Read,"I wouldn't go as far as saying that these are my favorite books of all time or anything, but they are fun to read. I have read the three that are in this set, and can't wait to start the next one. They keep you captivated. At times I feel that Mr. Goodkind has a cheesy way of describing things, but overall he has kept me interested in his story telling. I recommend these books to those that enjoy a little magic, and fantasy. I am not a hard core fantasy reader and I have enjoyed reading them."
1,I don't get it.,Considering how highly these books rate on Amazon my take is very much deviant. I purchased the set based on the aforementioned rating to occupy the downtime on a European vacation. I couldn't get further than 200 pages of the first book and ended up ditching the series in a time-share in Switzerland. You may say that I didn't really give the story a chance - that I was looking for any excuse to make room for souvenirs - but a volume such as this should have the space to develop the story and characters without forcing them along with a rapid-fire series of unbelievable coincidences and character attributes. If you are okay with that then you might like these as much as most everyone else.
4,Rich in detail,An above average work of the Fantasy genre. Enjoyed the book so much I am on the third one in the series.
3,Legend of the Seeker,"I like the premise of this book but I find the writing to be somewhat disconnected with to many short sentences. I wonder how long this man has been writing or if he needs to go to a writing school to help him. Don't get me wrong, I love the premise and the TV series is one of my favorites. I just find his writing somewhat lacking and hard to read."
2,"The ""Legend of the Seeker"" books","Well these are the books that the T.V. series ""Legend of the Seeker"" is based on but i can't say it's the best paper material I have ever seen. I am talking about the material and not the inside of the books(story). The worst paper stock ever........"
2,The beginning sounds just like Eragon,Am I the only person that sees a lot of similarities with the beginning of this story and the beginning of Eragon?
1,disapointment,i was very dissapointed in how the books came they were damaged the box was riped and they werent even the ones showd in the picture so now im not sure if i plan to order threw amazon anymore i was very disapointed in how my product came
4,Great Story,I saw the tv show and that got me interested in the books. I have to say the books are far better that the tv show. There is so much going on and just great stories. I love these books.
4,Excellent book set.,"I really liked the edition, although it has some printing errors. It's much better than the Castillian Spanish translation edition."
5,"The Sword of Truth, Boxed Set I, Books 1-3: Wizard's First Rule, Blood of the Fold ,Stone of Tears","It came faster than I thought it would. The books & box are in excelent condition. I'm 1/2 way throgh Stone of Tears; loved the 1st one, loving SoT & can't wait to read Blood of the Fold."
5,Sword of Truth,"Very fast transaction and accurate description of the item, so I would recommend this Seller."
4,Good story average product quality,"I loved this whole epic story. Its a fun read, all 11 of the books.Any fantasy enthusiast should give it a go.The budget books themselves are exactly that, budget. The paper quality is like newspaper and the print is small, but its fine enough to read through the book several times. It did not detract from enjoying the story."
5,Love this series!,"I love this series of books. Great story line and characters. Can't put them down! Has everything in it, awesome!"
2,"Looks nice, poor typography","The books look nice, especially inside the container.The negative is that the pages are printed poorly. The text runs to within 3 millimeters from the binding in the crease, which makes it irritating to read the book. I don't know if I happen to have a manufacturer defect, or just a poor decisition by a printing company.The books are still good, but I should've just bought the hardcovers since it can be irritating to read these due to the above.As far as the book content, it's great. Love the story, not appropriate for some younger readers as there are sections of the book (not overly graphic...) that deal with rape and torture. Just an FYI."
5,A breath of fresh air!!!!!,"I have been searching for that book to read but have run into a lot of deadends. The Wizards First Rule kept my attention and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. The best book I have read since ""Pilar's of the Earth"""
5,"WARNING!!! After reading this book, nothing will be the same","Wizard's First Rule was incredible. I have never read another book so detailed and emotional. A friend of mine lent me the book, telling me that I must read it. I still can't believe that i read such a long book in such a short time. I read that in 4 days, and about 800 pages in 4 days is exceptional reading for me. This book enveloped me in a world that i never wanted to leave. My girlfriend was jealous of the book! It's fantasy world can seem so familiar, yet so distant. The plot is spectacular. Thank you, Terry Goodkind. If only I could afford to go out and buy the whole series... (I am a poor person.) There is one downside to his book. WARNING!!! After you read this book, you will probably never find any other books as spectacular as they should be, again. Many novels pale in comparison to this. Your perception on everything in your world will change, forever."
2,Sexually disturbing-sadistic erotica,"Beware of these books for young readers. Each book becomes more and more obsessed with erotic, dragged out descriptions of women being raped, skinned alive, brutalized for days. All the women are big breasted, beautiful and constantly getting stripped naked. I can only hope that Goodfind does not have any children. Especially girls. He obviously has some serious problems. I would hate to see his images planted in the heads of young men developing their own sexual template in life. IF RAPE, MISOGYNY AND SADISM BOTHER YOU, DO NOT READ THESE BOOKS. THE AUTHOR LOVES THESE SUBJECTS WAY TOO MUCH!!!!"
3,Unfair Pricing,"It is very nice for us SciFi-Fantasy fans when these paperback boxed sets are released and economically priced, however, if we are embracing technology and using Amazon's product (Kindle) it would be nice to be able to get bundled selections for kindle with comparable price breaks."
4,nice but they don' t all match,While this boxset looks impressive on my shelf I feel compelled to write a review because of an odd choice made in the production of this otherwise perfect boxset. Volumes 1 and 3 both have gold gilt titles both on the front of the book and at the spine but for whatever reason volume 2's front and spine title are yellow. It's a littte annoying they don't match.
2,A bit too much,"I thought the story was good, but got totally bogged down in the writing. Way too much description slowed things down to much for my tastes... I think this book would have been excellent if it had kept the same story and lost about 200 pages. I can't bring my self to read the second two books in the series..."
5,What a party record!!! Get it!!!,"This is such a fun record! It spawned many hits of the era. It's a mix of vibe based boogaloo, soul, and tipico beats. It's essential and guaranteed to make you wanna dance.As for the reissue itself, it's pretty good. It's got the original artwork and it's remastered. However, I feel like I'm nitpicking here, but in some tracks there is a slight fade out and/or wobble. I guess the master tape may be damaged. I listened closely to earlier editions of this record, both on cd and LP and that problem is not present.Also, it's too bad that the LP warmth and ambiance has not transfered well into this cd. It sounds a bit too compressed. This info is just for the collector.If you just want the music, you have nothing to worry about. Great album!!!"
2,Bate and Switch,"I purchased this book which is advertised with the cassette and stated that the cassette would be sent along with the book. I only received the book and when I contact the seller, I got the run-a-round. I did not have the time to continue to follow up with them. I will never buy anything from them in the future."
3,Useful Pocket Book,"I love the vocabulary from this little book. Unfortunately, I've seen some errors and the accent marks are often placed on the wrong letter."
2,Just a phrasebook -- won't teach the language,"This consists of two phrasebooks: ""Chinese at a Glance"" (Seligan, Chen) and a very similar credit-card sized version. The tape does nothing but read from the smaller phrasebook. The larger book makes a small attempt to explain pronunciation. But neither makes any attempt to explain the grammar or anything about the language except by giving whole-sentence examples. The larger book has a small C-E E-C dictionary in the back.The two phrasebooks cover the same material, but with the phrases in a different order, making it impossible to follow the tape in the larger book. The type in the smaller book is very small, making the intonation marks almost illegible sometimes.Either book is very portable on a trip. The smaller one is really tiny, so if you're looking for a highly portable phrasebook, this isn't a bad choice. But this is a poor choice for learning the language."
2,Wait until it's on sale,"This playset isn't as spectacular as some of the others. Judge Snyder has quite a few things to say; however, Lionel Hutz only has one line, which seems odd since he is the most popular attorney on the show. Plus it is very difficult to attach the figures to 2 of the 3 ports because the guardrail makes it too small of an area. Some of the compatible figures, like Plow King Barney and Ranier Wolfcastle, are too large and fit better in unnatural poses (turn body 180 degrees at waist) if you can get them to fit at all. I really like the WOS toys on the whole, and although amusing, this set wasn't as entertaining as some of the others."
5,Camptown is my kind of town!,"I recently read Camptown: one hundred and fifty years of stories from Camptown, Kentucky. (Camptown is a fictitious town in Kentucky). This is a charming set of short stories with an authentic old-time, small-town flair. It's the perfect length for a leisurely glass of iced-tea on the front porch, or a nice sit down on the old wooden bench in the garden. Get out your Kleenex when you read the story about ""Camptown Races."" I loved ""Tom,"" as irascible a hero as you will ever meet, but I won't spoil it for you. This is the perfect book for a sunny afternoon outdoors, or perhaps a rainy day indoors snuggled up with with a cup of hot tea. Grimes is a great story teller, spinning us back to yesterday with his soft, comfortable style, and stories that whisper back to us of a time long past. Enjoy this book. I did."
1,Chapter 1 examples don't run,"Maybe the rest of the book is Ok, or maybe not. I just tried to run the examples of the first chapter and it was impossible for me."
5,An excellent book by the JDO experts,"JDO has recently gained popularity as a Java data access alternative to the lower-level JDBC interface and the more complex CMP (container-managed persistence) that works only with EJBs (Enterprise Java Beans). JDO's popularity is not surprising, it provides a lot of benefits over those APIs. And I should know, I was an architect of both JDBC and J2EE...This book provides a good introduction to JDO, as well as depth on the specifics. The authors are arguably the world's most knowledgable experts on JDO, since Craig Russell is the specification lead and Dave Jordan one of the biggest contributors to the JDO expert group."
2,Not properly instructed example,Chapter 1 of this book is available at Oreilly site. Try to make the first example work before you buy the book.
1,Try the first example and then buy the book,"Since the first chapter is freely available at Amazon, try to run the first example. Buy the book if you succeed without too much trouble.I have been always buy Java books from Oreilly. This one is really an exception."
1,Last Stage - Terminally Ill,This is by far the worse Budgie album ever. Budgie fans should not touch it even with a ten foot pole!
4,very nice,"This video is very nice for beggining to new intermediate dancers. There is a promotional video for this DVD on youtube. It does not show the whole dance, but you may find it helpful. I enjoyed watching this choregraphy and using elements in my own dance. Ansuya has a very distinct dance style and she gives you a wonderful taste of that style in this choreography."
3,hard to break in,"You know your feet the best, but for me, these were hard to break in and when they did, the arch wasn't in the right place. They were never the right shape for my feet, making them look shorter than they really are. That made it harder to get nice lines. The plie II's (capezio) worked better for me, but these might do the trick for you and they're quite a bit cheaper. These are great if you have a wider toe and a strong arch."
4,Let There Be Peas on Earth,"I've always been a big fan of the vegetable. Even as a kid, I had absolutely no problem eating my greens except for maybe, peas. I really hated peas from a can. They were just nasty! Frozen peas are okay, but sometimes they can be a little bitter tasting especially if they are not the ""petite"" variety. But now, ladies and gentlemen, we have in this ""Space Age"" society, dehydrated peas.Yeah, I know, I thought they were going to be nasty, too. But actually they are quite good. I mean, I'm not going to be like one reviewer and eat them like popcorn, but they are good and you can add them to a stew or a casserole and it won't look like you added slimy boogers to your meal. So, yeah, this is a good product. I'm still waiting for the five course dehydrated meal that comes in a single pill...that and personal rockets...come on now, having to make dinner and drive cars are so last century.Peas and Blessings!"
2,Styrofoam with taste,"We really like the corn so I wanted to get this as a healthy snack. It sucks the moisture out of you & tastes like styrofoam. If you add water & microwave the peas, they taste real good. Now I have to figure out what to do with 2 tubs of this stuff."
5,Have used this product for over 30 years,"My husband has been using this product since the 70s and he smells wonderful. I have purchased him some newer more expensive aftershave over the years, but some have caused allergic reactions. I'm sensitive to certain scents. We always come back to this product."
5,I have used Jovan Musk since it became available years ago.,I received Jovan as a gift for Father's Day from one of my kids.After shaving I applied it and couldn't believe the pleasant sensation and aroma it had.I've used no other after shave since.
5,A Perfect sound with lots of HEART,"At first listen it reminded me a lot of Cinderella, Motley Crue, Stryper with the SWEEET Guitar riffs and rythm. the I caught the story lines and what David was saying and i was totally hooked.The thoughts he conveys into his music is nothing short of amazing..... I particularly Love the last song"" Making Love"" and even though it's strickly instrumental it still tells a Great love story . THANKS David and keep producing such great music.."
2,Not Much of a Memoir,"This book is not a memoir, but rather a collection of musings on various subjects that sprang from the mind of Isaac Asimov to whom the author was married. While there is some interesting material here, it really is not worth the hefty price tag. You are better off reading Isaac Asimov's autobiographies. If you insist on reading this work, wait for it to show up at the local public library or get it on interlibrary loan instead."
1,customer service is horrible,"i bought a archos 380 and camera on amazon, both products would not work properly, rma's were issued and i spent 30 dollars to send the items back, when they returned after several weeks, the unit was NOT repaired and the camera was replaced with one that was worse then the old one, i have sent many emails to no avail, finally they issued a new rma, and they want me to pay to send it in ""again"",i refuse to send them my 380 again since now they have had the product more then i have had the product. and i told them to send me a back up 380 and camera and i will send in my broke ones AGAIN, they wont do it. do not buy this product. I bought the product in jan. and its now march. i am currently on hold with their customer service for an hour. no answer yet"
3,"Good quality, not too happy with color","It good quality and I like that it's made in USA, but I hoped for a darker finish on the outside which it was kind of misleading in some of the pictures. Once I got it the outside picture on the box looked like it was a nice dark finish, once opening it was even lighter in color than the pictures online. I understand there's going to be some variances in tone and darkness with stained wood but this was all over the spectrum."
2,too small,I didn't realize this was miniature edition. It is too smalland the flaps are too flimsy. ... I still would like a largeredition.
3,A warning,"My 15-month old son loves Spot and all the other Spot videos we have, but he cries (actually screams) when in ""Where's Spot"" Spot finds the cat and it hisses at him. He doesn't like the bear in the party segment much either. I have to fast forward past those segments when he's not in the room in order to show him the rest which are fine. ""Spot Makes a Cake"" is one of his favorites."
5,DECEMBER #4,I read the book wheres spot because it is a great picture book for little kids. The kids like this book because the pictures interest them and they cant wait to see whats on the next page. They like to pull the pop out thing on their own because they are so interested in it. I think it helps kids with their imagination and their senses.I enjoyed reading this book again because it reminds me of going to the kolb library when I was little and in elementary we all use to want to rent this book.
2,Good for Little Kids ages 1 to 4.,"I watch this video with my little brother, and I notices that it is a great video for kids ages 1 to 4.In this story, Spot does not want to eat his dinner, so he hides in a basket, so his mom had to search around the house. Next, he has a party, and all the friends play Hide and Seek. In another one, he needs a bath from rolling around outside with his friends.This is wonderful for kids, and it helps them discover their world. It is a fun way for little kids to learn.My least favorite parts are when you see the snake in the clock, and when the cat screams at Spot. The illustrations are set to the right manor, and the colors and music is calm. Kids will not notice the plain white space in the distance.I recommend this to kids the ages of 1 to 4. If you have kids, they will enjoy it, and you might catch yourself watching it, too."
3,Small Size,"We bought this to replace our old ""Where's Spot"" from when *I* was a child myself, an older hardcover version from the 80's. While this book is a nice sturdy board book, the pages are rather small... meaning the flaps that hide the animals are rather small for our one-year old son to grasp. He still gets the enjoyment from finding the animals underneath, just the board book version of this could benefit from larger hiding flaps. I would recommend parents to find the hardcover version with soft pages inside."
5,My Daughters' Favorite,"I bought this 30 years later for my daughter to have as her sister has the family's original copy (with torn flaps from so much use). In my family,Try the basket!,is a mantra. A must have for young kids."
1,This bracket bent first time out.,"I have a nice aluminum ballmount and didn't want to buy a steel ballmount just so I could weld a sway control tab on it. When I came across this bracket I thought it was a great idea and I'd be able to keep my lightweight aluminum ballmount. But it's worthless and I wasted my money. The bracket will swivel on the ballmount because its cutout is wider than a ballmount itself. Kind of defeats the purpose. The bracket looks beefy enough, but it isn't as it bent up after the first use. I ended up going with a steel mount with a tab welded on it and haven't had a problem since."
2,Disappointing,"We were all hoping for a good show equal in quality to Tombstone which was also supposed to be historically accurate. But, unlike Tombstone, the Hatfields and McCoys Clans were largely portrayed as ignorant drunken retards barely capable of intelligent thought. I hated the movie - not because it was based on actual events but because the ""historical events"" were portrayed in a the most negative light possible. Drunken Randall McCoy running into a tree during a battle and firing wildly in all directions while lying on his back..... prove it!"
1,Can't Watch,Do not buy this!!! you can not play it on a PC. All I have is 2 computers hooked up to two TV's neither will play it nor will my desktop. Took the DVD over to a friends house that still has a traditional DVD player and it worked fine. Sony with all there efforts on security apparently has made it so those of us that watch TV through media center can not watch their DVDs.
5,An incredible story !,"My husband and I decided to watch this after hearing my parents talk about how good it was. We instantly became obsessed! I think what is most shocking is that this is based on a true story. I was so captivated by some of the events that I even went and looked at the Wikipedia to see how much this movie kept to the true story, and I found out that they stayed very true to the actual Hatfield and McCoy fued. If you like American history and a great story, this mini series is excellent and was very well done!"
5,Hatfields & Mccoys,"LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!!. This is a true story of these two families in south eastern Ky and south western WV. Kevin Costner as Devil Hatfield was wonderful. I would recommend this series to everyone. From an eastern Ky girl."
3,mixed feelings,I had mixed feelings reading the book. I feel that it was hard to follow mainly because there were so many different characters. It also reverted back and repeated way to many times. The flow was not smooth and at times confusing.But the plot was simple enough to follow and the narative was colorfull enough to keep me interested.
4,Well Done!,"Great job Kevin Costner & Bill Paxton... the directing was awesome, too. You could tell everyone was invested in this movie."
1,Great Potential But You'll Be Disappointed,"Don't count on any help from the company/manufacturer over the life of the toy. While you pay a premium for these high-tech innovations from this company, they do not support their products over the long run. Our music blocks toy, with programmable cartridges sit useless because the company refuses to support them any more. I won't buy any more of their products."
1,Deceptive marketing - watch out!,"We thought we were buying a ""Music Block"", but we actually bought a *cartridge* for a Music Block. Check out the name for this item - ""Music Blocks Kid Classics"". It should be called ""Cartridge for Music Blocks Kid Classics.""We returned it promptly as it was no use to us."
2,Not worth the money,"You pay for the Illinois logo on whatever you buy, and this is no different. This is a very thin and cheap towel for the money. If it didn't have the University of Illinois on it, it would sell for $5."
4,Great for cleaning your scalp,This little brush is great for cleaning your scalp while shampooing your hair. It will even work on your pets.
3,Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush,"This product was okay but after using it for a couple of months, the handle on it broke. Obviously, it still works but for how long? It is a bit flimsy but still the best one we found so far. It would be better if they made it a little sturdier."
2,Bristles are way too hard,"On some days it feels ok, but on most its like washing your hair with construction nails. Bristles need more flex. Get what you pay for here. Gave it two stars cause the dog loves it."
3,Scalpmaster Shampoo Brush,It works OK but I wish it was a little larger and had the knob that you grasp between two fingers. I hands and fingers aere rather large so the hole for the finger is a little snug.
1,Making Ends Meet???,"I was extremely dissapointed when I received this book! Although the content has good potential, I felt it was overly simplified and just barely skimmed the surface of what it really takes to set up a good budget and stick to it. It did not have the depth that it could have had, to really help me through my financial situation. I would, in no way, recommend this phamplet to anyone who is seriously looking for help thru a book to set up a budget and get out of debt!"
4,THIS WILL GET YOU ON TO A GOOD START,"As much as I spend money, I needed this as a guide to save more. This is simpistic, and easy to follow. So far in the past 3 months that I have followed the advice in this book, I have made tremendous progress in my spending patterns and saving habits. I even put some money in a CD to avoid spending it! For me, that's a miracle.I suggest that if you want to start basic, this book is an excellent way to start."
5,Extremely Well read!!!,"Others have already written accurately of this author's wonderful, poignant prose and the need for us to be learned about this and other genocides and atrocities. To these reviews I add the judgment: ""Only infrequently is so important a book read with such grace and clarity."" I listen to many books-on-CD and am often disappointed in their lack of quality. All too often the readers speak too softly, mumble their words, resort to a sing-song speech pattern, or mispronounce words. Ordinary Man is narrated with lovely cadence and clarity. This is one of those books-on-CD I will listen to again and again, and which I highly recommend.Incidentally, I would be very appreciative of readers recommending to me other books-on-CD which they have found particularly provocative and well read: btodd-mancillas@csuchico.edu.--Wm. R. Todd-MancillasProfessor: Communication Studies(36 years of experience teaching inthis field)."
3,"Good , not great","Surprisingly everyone else rates this as 5 out of 5.It is good, but not that good.Paul's writing style is a little dry at times, and shows his limited education.It is also a littel disjointed , and doesn't give enough insight into characters that he had known before the genocide, and they could have been expanded with further background.The book took longer to read than it should have, and did not hold my interest or intensity as others on this subject have.Nevertheless, it is a great adjunct to understanding the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" , from which this film was based.Still an essential part of everyone's library, but I would probably not read it twice.Derek"
3,An Ordinary Man,Like all the other book that I order at this time this book give their perspective on the affect of war. The class inwhich these books are being used is based on the affects of war from different nationallities.
4,Great for the price,"I waited until the end of winter to get one of these. Made in the Dominican Republic, mostly of wool, this coat is better for everyday use, as opposed to the JAB cashmere coat. So far, it doesn't attract as much dust as I thought. The coat has a wonderful ability to keep me warm while outdoors, yet stay light and breathable while indoors. I have a heavier wool coat made in the Soviet Union that has none of the lightness of the Jos Bank coat, and attracts more dust than my hip hop CD collection.All in all, a great winter coat"
2,Off color,"This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan. Even the tag says tan. I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband. I never would have ordered a tan. Also the coat fit like a whole size larger. I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund."
3,Topcoat,"Only 5% Cashmere, quality is not bad overall but not as good as it is represented to be. Price to value, could be better."
2,Bad quality,"The audio and video are out of sync. For the ENTIRE video. It's at least 10 seconds off. The video quality isn't that great either. I realize it's a bikini video, but the lack of sync make's it unbearable to watch. Not worth it."
3,Pleasant Enough Read,"I have heard it said that Mercedes Lackey is certainly a prolific writer if not a great one. There is probably some truth to that. Exile's Honor is an example of what a very good writer can produce, if it is written a little too quickly. I actually liked this book, the story was interesting, the characters somewhat unique and remarkable, but . . . it just doesn't seem to be finished.There are too many twists in the story that normally would be foreshadowing of events to come that turn out to be nothing. Why are they there? Who knows. It reads like the plot had been altered as the writing progressed but nothing was done to align the story at the end. It just seemed to be hurried and unfinished. Maybe she expects to write more about Alberich and the beginning of Queen Selenay's reign, if that's so then it might explain the lack of closure, the unfinished feeling.All in all it was a pleasant story, a fairly quick read. Neither deep nor profound it was fun and I do RECOMMEND it."
3,O.K.,"This was a pretty good book, but what bothered me was Alberich was so emotional. Extremely emotional. Anyway, it's a good book, and has several very funny parts. Look for when Selenay takes him fishing."
4,More complex than she used to be,"Compared to the early books in this series (such as the Arrows of the Queen trilogy), this deep-backgrounder on Herald/Weaponsmaster Alberich is very sophisticated in its handling of moral and ethical questions. This is the case not only for Alberich himself, but also for the Karsite weaponsmaster who trained him, and the discussions of the varying nature of the priesthood of Vkandis Sunlord. It doesn't slow down the story line -- it just gives it greater depth."
5,One of her best...,"I like the book because of the quality of writing that been missing lately in her books. I first got hooked onto her novels when I read ""By The Sword"" which this books reminds me of a lot. Both are VERY enjoyable. I will definietly buy this book and probably the valor one when both become paperbacks."
3,mellodramatic,"""Exile's Honor"" is enjoyable and entertaining. The word that best describes ""Exile's Honor"" is mellodramatic. The main character spends a lot of time feeling sorry for himself, exagerating his problems, basking in the sympathy of friends, and boasting. This is quite fun if you are in the mood.The plot and setting and personalities are similar to all of Mercedes' other books: her main characters are powerful & highly skilled, have problems with teasing & not fitting in, receive unquestioning affection from a mystic friend, and have casual sex. The setting is a magical / fantasy variant of the middle ages."
5,Alberich RULES!!!,"I loved this one! Good job, Misty!Alberich is so cool. I can't wait until Exile's Valor to see what happens next! (Dare we hope for some scenes with Alberich and Myste?)Alberich is one the best characters of the Valdemar series, and in this one we learn his story-how he was Chosen, how he came to be Weaponsmaster, and how he interacts with Queen (then Princess) Selenay.Plus, he talks like Yoda! (Big plus for Star Wars buffs like moi!)Seriously, it's about a complex individual, trying to decide what to do when his world is turned upside down. What is ""honor""? Can Alberich fight for his King without betraying his own people? What to do with Heralds that don't quite fit the mold?Not to mention that Alberich is incredibly sexy! What a shocker, eh?"
2,This book had potential,"Unfortunately the author has a tendency to breeze over some of the more interesting aspects of the story. For people that like a light read, it might be ok, but the story is not very exciting, I put this book down alot. The climax comes after 300+ pages and is a letdown, followed by an utterly boring couple of chapters which had me screaming for the story to end. Lackey writes about emotions the protagonist feels alot but doesn't spend enough time on the characters overall, possibly introduces too many new characters, and lets the reader down by foreshadowing plot possibilities that never materialize. What does happen instead is utterly boring, fluffy fantasy writing. Additionally, the emotional bond and telepathic/empathic abilities between the human ""Heralds"" and the horse-like ""Companions"", is more likely to appeal to young girls that like horses than to seasoned fantasy readers. Yawn...."
1,i couldn't even finish it.,"In a word, BORING.I've never read one of Mercedes Lackey's books before and I hesitate to reserve any amount of time to do so again.First of all, the protagonist was so flat I was hoping he would get killed off just to make him interesting. The only entertaining part of the book was Kantor, his companion, and that didn't make it worth my time. I feel like Myste was an incredible let down in evolving. Why did we get to know her when nothing substantial happens?Don't waste time/money/effort. Find a better writer, one with more imagination and better character development. I don't get why people like her books. It's like something a teenager wrote and that might be insulting teenagers.And what is up w/ the italics!!!!!????? Every word does NOT deserve emphasis"
3,Two Words: Mary Sue,"The book itself was alright. Not, I think, Mercedes Lackey's best work but also not her worst. The character of Alberich is complicated and beloved, by fans and Ms. Lackey alike I think, and it's great to see his story explored. The plot is fairly typical of a Valdemar book (about what I've come to expect).On the other hand, Ms. Lackey or ""Misty"" as she is often called by her fans, has decided to write herself into the story. For me, this was a jarring decision that completely detracted from my enjoyment of the book. It might have been okay if she'd written herself into a minor role, but as a major character who comes to save day? Seriously?I guess every author makes his or her decisions. It's their world, after all. However, I as a reader can decide if I want to read her books or not, and this Mary Sue addition annoyed me enough to decide: No, I don't think I will be continuing this series."
3,Not so sure...,"I am not done reading this yet, but I just got into the section where we first see Myste and she might as well be walking around with a sign that says Mary Sue on it. Written on her forehead. In red marker. Don't get me wrong, I love most of Lackey's Valdemar series. Like nearly everyone else who commented here, LHM was life-changing for me too. However, I think that naming her Myste was a cute little nod we could all stand in the other books when she wasn't ever really shown to us in a signifigant way, but now? The similarities between this character and what I know of the author herself are setting off some warning bells."
1,good idea bad concept,"The binocular is pretty good excellent optics.The digital camera part is the problem.REALLY low quality and that's on the high setting.The image is fuzzy and not only because of shake.Is even worse in low light conditions. Another problem is the battery length, with 2 AAA batteries you can get about 15-20 shots only.If you want to get anyway i would suggest getting lower priced combo it can hardly be worse than the Carson ...."
3,"OK, but........","It is a little bukier than I expected. A huge problem I had was the battery life: I only took 8 shots before a new pair of Duracells run dead. When the light is right, the picture is quite good."
5,Excellent way to see London close-up,This book is wonderful for doing walking tours of London on your own and seeing the neighborhoods close-up rather than just the gloss over the tour companies give. The variety of the walks in this book is excellent in length and variety of things to see. We needed to use another map to get us back on the walking tour in a couple of places but mostly that was because we were staring at the sights rather than following the tour directions properly. The times given for the tours are definitely at a leisurely pace that allows for plenty of time to look at the shops and sites along the way. Showing starting and stopping points at the Tube stops made the walks very easy to get to.
3,Great Book - Need to Place It on an iPod,"London is a wonderful city for people who like to walk. It's flat, central London isn't all that huge, there are gobs of beautiful parks and there are even some public toilets in the parks, benches and drinking fountains. ""Walking London"" is a fine guide to a series of multi-neighborhood walks and well worth buying. It would be better if it were available in an electronic form that could go on an iPod since carrying a book this size along on a walk detracts from the walk somewhat. Even so, buy the book and copy the pages for walks you intend to take."
5,Filled with London history,"I bought this book to familiarize myself with the history of famous landmarks in London. There are a series of walks one can take through London past these places. Though it is not a newly published book (copyrights listed 1991 through 2001), it is a wonderful read. I'd recommend it for that reason, but not if you expect it to be just like London today."
5,Very useful!,"Highly recommended by my friends who use it extensively. They find it more cost effective than group tours and, of course, it allows the user to set their own pace, rather than follow that of a group."
1,"DVDs, please","The difference between even standard-def DVD quality and download/stream is obvious. Jagged edges, less color definition, and while it might look ""good enough"" on a portable smartphone, the price should be 1/3rd what's being asked. Not the same price for lesser quality."
2,Forced Fun,"One of the things the Simpsons does really well is refer back to itself, or write new stories that fit in with the old ones. The problem with this episode is that is completely fails to do so. It refers back to past that completely fails to fit in with the rest of the Simpsons story. It was still funny in some respects, but not one of the greats, and definitely not one of my favorite episodes. It just felt too forced instead of effortlessly fun."
2,could be better,"a good book for someone who knows nothing or very little about chinchillas but would like to learn. i wouldnt advice getting this as a book to help you raise a chin of your own since it doesnt cover alot of info (what not to feed, what number to keep) and its out of date as it was written in 1987. it does have good colored pictures and cute cartoon pictures but not alot of good info."
4,Loved it!,"Interesting, easy to watch, feel-good, tender, husband didn't groan even once while watching it... really liked this movie!"
2,local color,"I think the ""Local Color"" reviewers have been too generous with their praises. The movie is just ok at best. I think most artists would be a little disappointed with this movie. The film has very simplistic views on modern art vs representational art-MODERN ART IS BAD. The acting was good. This movie needs a beter script by someone with a deeper understanding of art and artists. This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. Too predictble. Artists looking for painting tips won't learn much. People who like sentimental films may enjoy the relationship of the characters. Just my opinion. Thanks"
5,Even the trailer is spectacular!,"Considering that watching the trailer brought tears of happiness to my eyes, I can't wait to enjoy the entire film and the special DVD features that I'm betting are included!"
1,cartoon characters in drivelly story,this was a truly awful movie. i was embarressed to be a painter. ugh. might have been interesting if it had been edited down to 10 minutes.
5,Sleek and beautiful towel bar,"This is a great towel bar with screws that will work for wall board or studs (probably only one stud since it is a 24 inch bar).For wall board, the kit included self-drilling screw-in plastic anchors that the steel screws thread into.The same steel screws work directly in the stud and the orientation of the holes in the bracket was vertical to make it easy to hit the stud.I had no problem aligning it with the spots the old 24 inch towel bar was mounted to so that it covered the old mounting area even with wall paper.Mounting was simple and the bar is sturdy. I would highly recommend it."
5,Really nice hardware,"I ordered these for the master bath and they are very nice and well made. They also provide way better than average harward - in particular the drywall mounting parts so they lock in pretty nice itf you don't get a stud, which for this part is pretty likely at least on one end.I will give it 4 stars but I also bought some Grohe 24"" towel bars. (Essential line) for the 'other bathrooms' and found that line to be slightly nicer and also cheaper. I think the 24"" towel bar on the Grohe was 25% less and a touch nicer. but they are both nice and these actually come out from the wall a touch more so I will keep them . Once they are up you can not tell the weight difference. They are well made and DO NOT WIGGLE/Rattle at all just a little lighter weight than I would have though... But, Danze is nice stuff and finish is perfect."
3,Eh. It's ok.,"I love superman and the game seems like it's got a good plot and seems like it would be fun if only I could work the whole flying aspect correctly. It's so hard to fly with these games. I push up and he goes down, I push down and he goes up. If I push the speed button, he passes where I need him to go but if I barely push it I lose the game. So I try changing the buttons and I still can't get the hang of it. All in all I haven't gotten too far. I just got used to getting harry potter to fly on my ps2 game station and I'm still working on getting jaws to swim on my ps2. It's gonna take me a little while before I figure out superman on my nintendo ds."
4,for my golfer,"It was a stocking stuffing for my son.He quite liked it.He's a golf pro , so he found it an appropriate gift."
1,broke after 3 months...,"I have been using these as day-time running lights on my Mazda Miata. They replaced a pair of older Hellas (similar model but with amber lenses) that lasted almost 10 years. On this set both glass lenses cracked within 3 months! The cracks are clearly due to overheating. If you plan on more than just occasional use, stay clear of these lights."
3,"Good for inexpensive fog lamps, but...","You may or may not like these, depending on what you're trying to do. What I found is that the beam pattern isn't very even - it tends to favor the edges. There is a little metal shield inside that can be bent a bit to increase the amount of light coming out of them. I was hoping for a little better build quality - and really didn't want the wiring harness. That money could have been put into better R&D; and materials for this.Another thing that I didn't like so much is the open rectangular hole on the bottom of the housing that leaks light. I suppose these could be creatively patched.They are much brighter with HID bulbs in them though, and with a little modification. I like the harness that's included but the switch seems flimsy (I don't plan to use it and didn't care).So if you're looking for an decent pair of small and inexpensive fog lamps - and are willing to put HID bulbs in them, this might work great for you."
3,Not that happy with them.,"There's leakage of light above internal plate...the output appears dim and not very evenly distributed. I put an HID bulb inside and it's not much better. I might try a more open design that has a parabolic reflective material behind the bulb. The external construction is fine. I think someone else mentioned this, it gets too hot to touch with a bare hand too, which was expected with 55 watts. I was hoping to use these for a weatherproof outdoor portable light system but I will be trying one of the other designs now."
4,Very good wine glasses,"I have used the glasses for over a year. Yes, I was very skeptical that the wine glass can make the wine taste better, but I am convinced. We have purchased many more Reidel since and we highly recommend them."
4,Very Informative,"These 2 theologians provide great, in-depth answers to some common, crucial questions about the Catholic faith. This is an awesome book for anyone who wants to learn more about the basics of Catholicism--not just teenagers. Don't purchase this book looking for some kind of faith-manual though. This is not The Purpose Driven Life, and it's not supposed to be. It's factual and interesting, but it is not the type of book that really sets your heart on fire (though enflaming the mind is also an important aim). I would really recommend this book. God bless!"
5,answers for those tough questions,this book discusses in simple language some of the most basic questions of being human. it deals with these questions in a logical progression. the questions are those that everyone has asked at one time or another. it is a must read for anyone with these basic questions in life.
3,A trip back in time,"Very good book. It really took me back to the 1400's, when everyone thought the earth was the center of the universe, and the sum and stars revolved around the Earth. The style of writing, and the enormity of the meesage was very illuminating.I have to admit, though, after getting into the math and the scientific explanations, it gets pretty dry. I've only gotten 1/2 way through the book. But, because it's actually written by Copernicus, it is fascinating.And, he made all these observations almost a century before telescopes were around.PS i was led to read this, because of the book, Galileo's Daughter, which discusses the life of Galileo, his invention of the telescope, and the persecutions he faced."
5,Helpful for class,I would purchase from this seller again and recommend. The item was delivered promptly and in the condition promised.
1,Rated it One Star Because There Was Nothing Lower,"I was looking for a serious treatment of a very important subject and found the book trivial and very shallow. Sure there are cartoons, but if one wanted a cartoon book there are many more that are much better.The whole Dummies series has gotten out of hand. They ought to team up with More Turkey Soup to be Spoon Fed by Dummies. Perhaps the series should be called Dummies Books by Dummies.There are many better books about accounting than this."
4,Don't know math? Need to know accounting?,"This is the book. This book got me, a non-quantitative anti-numbers person, through MBA financial accounting. Particularly good are chapters 5-9, that help interpret and explain financial statements. By no means does this offer everything you need to know for accounting, but offers a great foundation (hence, Dummies). I have also used it in my personal life to review info on my stocks."
2,Not for people who want to learn how to crunch some numbers.,"If you are looking for a book that actually gives you good examples that will teach you to crunch some numbers on your own and prepare accounting statements and such, then this is NOT the book for you. It has a lot of writing about the different areas of accounting, but it did little for me. I was looking for a book that gave me real life examples that could help me understand how to do minimal accounting for my smal business. Some of the other introduction to accounting books are much better in this regard."
3,Misnamed,"Although billed as a reference on accounting, this book is very inadequate for that purpose.There are numerous accounting basics that are not mentioned or only touched on in passing. Among those that are not addressed at all are the following: monetary measurement, separate entity, realization, materiality. There are also other essentials that are missing.There are several other fundamentals that are not covered adequately. Items in this category include these: FIFO, LIFO, and double entry accounting. Even the three essential reports of accounting - the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows - are inadequately covered.This may be ok as a supplement to another book, but it is lacking a bit as a standalone on the subject it purports to cover."
3,College Accounting -- this is not the book to help.,"This will not help in any college accounting courses, in my opinion. This is why I bought the book, but it did not help."
2,not so exciting,"This book is quite disappointing, and I (someone with no accounting background) find it boring and too easy--the manual for an accounting software seems more exciting than this. I feel there is little about accounting in this book; rather, I find a huge section praising what accountants do. I think if numbers give you a headache and you abhor math, you may consider laboring through this book. Otherwise, try something else."
2,complicated,I got this book because I am taking classes and thought it would explain the accounting system to where I could understand it. But I am still at a loss. The overall buying experience was admirable.
4,Great for Accounting Majors!,"I book this book in hopes of helping me with my college classes in Accounting, it is a wonderful tool for studying!"
4,Good for concepts,A very good book for understand the concepts.The only problem with kindle version: To a good understanding you must view and review the examples all the time. And it's not so easy to do this on e-book.In my point of view this is the only advantage of paper book. You can bookmark the current page with your finger while you check the figures in the exemple.
2,not helpful,the cliff's notes online is better than this. it's not in depth enough. do not get this if you are interested in bookkeeping.
3,Accounting for Dummies,I like all of the Dummies books. This one met my expectations - I needed it to supplement the Accountin I class I was taking.
3,Oh its 4 dummies,"Another dummy book, tis one on accounting. Yawn. It did the job we expected it to do. Fill-in words, fill-in words, over and out."
3,If it worked it would be great,"It worked great for about a month then the master output bass failed, the button mapping became buggy (requiring a reinstall of the software) and the booth volume knob fell off. Perhaps I got a lemon..."
4,muy bueno,realmente es bastante completo por lo que se recomienda el mismo la entrega fue a tiempo no hay queja alguna sobre el productoM-Audio Torq Xponent Advanced DJ Performance/Production System
4,great,"I ordered this for an event at the office. I didn't use it personally, but from what I hear from those who did, it rocks."
4,Torq Xponent is Sweet!,"You can mix and scratch just like vinyl. I only wish M-Audio added a mic input. Other than that, if you want to mix without the bulk and $$$$'s of 1200's and a mixer, this a great way to go. Be sure to update the software to v 1.5. I have used this thing at events with 300 plus people with no problems."
4,"I like it, but not with Torq","I have had one of these for about a year now, and I really love it, except for 2 things.1. no mic input that kinda sucks replace the pedal port on the back with a mic in and that would make this thing 100x better.2. Torq sucks, bad.I have since mapped the xponent into Traktor and it makes a great midi control surface for that software and Traktor not only analyses the files 100x more accurately its more stable and easier to use."
1,BEWARE - SUPER CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP - ABSOLUTE JUNK! NOT WORTH A QUARTER!,I read the reviews - took at gamble they were not that bad - but they are. Pure junk - cheap cheap cheap - paper thing and both arrived broke.
1,Take these broken wings...,"I received my order for the balsa wood airplane (Toysmith 5000 Guillow's Sky Streak Glider) very quickly, however the wing piece arrived cracked/broken in 3 places. The envelope it shipped in was fairly flimsy and it came out of the package already damaged and unusable. The seller said in order to get a replacement I would need to send this one back. More trouble than it's worth, especially if it will ship in the same flimsy packaging and the replacement will likely arrive broken too."
2,Make a paper airplane instead,"My 7 and 4 year old boys love flying paper airplanes. I saw this and thought it would be a cool toy for them. This is one of those, ""you get what you pay for"". It is cheap and fragile. I'm not sure it even lasted 10 minutes. Save your money and make a paper airplane instead."
4,TRACK LIST,"Track Listing1. Tomorrow2. Just Drink the Hemlock3. Left4. Silent Knife5. Joke, A6. Shooting Birds at Mimes7. 20018. Rrip9. Bookends10. Chary11. Last Call"
5,Another Great One,"In this book Ray Halfmoon lives with his Grandfather. It is a collection of 6 short stories about their lives as Seminole-Cherokee living in Chicago. These stories are enduring and heart warming. The stories are:Indian ShoesDon't Forget The Pants!Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?The AccidentTeam ColorsNight FishingFrom stories about pants not being delivered with a tux for a wedding, to a Christmas menagerie, these stories will be fun to read as a family again and again. You will find yourself rooting for Ray, and surprised by his grandfather's kindness, gentleness and ingenuity in solving problems and making things right. It is a wonderful book by an amazing author."
4,Great Gift,"""Indian Shoe"" is the book that shows the light at the end of a dark tunnel. There is life and hope after a disaster! This book is a story of a beautiful relationship between a boy ""Ray"" and his grandfather. The author of this book, artistically, pictures the current lives of Native Americans in the mind of the readers. Although there are complexities in this book, there is a unique simplicity and a calming tone to it which makes it a ""good read"". The reader will go through different emotions including sadness and humor while reading this book.The six tales of this book make it an ""easy read"" as well. As a teacher and a school librarian, I recommend this book to my student. It also makes a great gift from a grandfather."
3,Hector Berlioz influence,"The theme for Battle of the Heroes sounds a lot like the Dies Irae theme from Symphonie Fantastique's ""Songe d'une nuit sabbat"" by Hector Berlioz."
1,Not so Good,This was poorly put together. I did not like it at all. The music could have been a lot better.
3,The music is the only quality remnant of SW remaining,"Such a shame that Phantom and Clones are two of the WORST films ever made but their orchestral cues from John Williams are the one thing that the series may claim were consistently good all the way through. It comes with a dvd cut with footage from all 6 films. It would have been even better if it had the original ""THX WOW"" laserdisc demo. Eventually a full 2 or 3 disc special ed of the entire score for this film likely will be released. And ENOUGH of calling these films ""Episodes""; they are in fact:""STAR WARS"" - NOT ""EPISODE 4""; NOT ""A New Hope""""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"" - NOT ""EPISODE 5""""RETURN OF THE JEDI"" - NOT ""EPISODE 6""""THE PHANTOM MENACE"" - A PIECE OF S___""ATTACK OF THE CLONES"" - A SAGA RUINED""REVENGE OF THE SITH"" - LUCAS' FAILURE IS COMPLETE"
5,Great soundtrack,"Excellent soundtrack, much better than the Episode II's. The best themes are the Battle of the Heroes and Anakin's Betrayal."
3,Undistinguished,"Plainly stated, this is just not Williams' best of the ""Star Wars"" scores. He re-introduces (recycles?) themes from previous (later?) episodes, without really creating any new material that stands alone as being uniquely of this film. Frankly, he seems to have run out of both ideas and steam. However -- and it's a major however -- the DVD that accompanies the album is an absolute must for any ""Star Wars"" fan. It's a brilliantly produced, extraordinarily exciting reminder of just how entertaining and transporting the six films are, and how vital Williams' past contributions have been to their success. He's an amazing composer, but he could and should have come up with a final score that's a little more fresh and distinctive."
5,Everything you would expect and more,"The sound track itself is some of Williams' best work, but the spotlight of this product should be the included DVD. If you could just imagine the entire Star Wars series as a music video you would have a pretty good idea as to what to expect. When I watched it, it was almost as good as seeing the entire series for the first time.I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes star wars or even good music."
5,Movie music maestro John Williams does it again in Star Wars,"Just like the movie, the music for Episode 3 plays dark, but still keeps the great sense of adventure and excitement that only John Williams can deliver. Echoing some of his old classics from the 70s (Superman and Close Encounters) every track moves faster than a blaster shot and manages to stick in the memory more than Attack of the Clones. Despite the darkness, heartfelt tracks like Anakin's Dream and Padme's Destiny are amazing. But also welcome are the devilishly dark Palpatine's Teachings, Anakin Vs. Obi-Wan and Enter Lord Vader. Running just over 70 minutes, this never repeats itself and keeps the momentum surprisingly high. And just like previous Williams scores, this is of higher caliber than the movie itself. Being a completist, I snatched this right up and I wasn't disappointed. This wraps up the saga well while throwing in cues from the original trilogy, specifically Empire Strikes Back. Excellent."
4,The Final Piece!,"The score for this movie just seems to tie everything together for the entire saga. Everyone seems to forget this is the middle of the story overall, and I'm surprised by how many people are mad about using cues from the original trilogy. I expected to hear new music and hints of what is to come (Episodes IV, V, & VI). The main thing I love about John Williams' scoring is the themes that carry over the entire course of the movies. This final score, fits exactly where it should in the grand scheme of the movies. Great buy for a soon to be great movie."
4,The Dark Side Is Strong With This One!,"The score to Revenge of the Sith is unlike the other five soundtracks. Although there are various subtle hints of familiar themes throughout (the Main theme, the Imperial March, the Force theme, etc.), there is ""a brand new sound"" - John Williams made some interesting choices. The music is violently ominous and powerful. Considering evil triumphs in this episode, it's all very appropriate. The soundtrack compliments the Dark Side of the Force. Without question, every fan should have this in there collection - the bonus DVD, ""Star Wars: A Musical Journey,"" makes it worthwhile alone."
5,Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude!,"Hey! You know that guy who gave this CD a four? Yah, He doesn't know wud heez talkin bout. I pray to god that he reads this review cuz he needs to know what it feela like to be the wrongest person on da planit . J W is my home boy and dis disc be da bom. I really hate it when guys like that guy who hated on episode III hate cuz it make me feel like all angri and shee yo. I would luv it if they was just all like five stars and shee yo. Piece out!"
5,Missing Music,There's alot of missing music in this soundtrack. Some tracks follow the movie then end and fade into another part without finishing that which was in the movie. For instance in Anakins bad deeds the music follows the movie to a point then skips 30 seconds of powerful music and ends with another scene. I love John Williams music but this was released unfinished. I will however give it a five for the DVD that comes with it. It's excellent! I showed it to my girlfriend before we went to ROTS so she would be up to speed on the movie.I will buy this again if there is an extended version. There has been four different versions of the original trilogy released so I'm sure this one has a re-release coming next year with more music.
5,A Must for Star Wars fans,"John Williams once again provided us with some excellent music to go along with the greatest movie epic ever made. The only dissappointment I have with the soundtrack is it is not the same music as what is in the movie. Most of the tracks are altered a bit in the film, and I must say they are altered for the better. The music with the film is amazing. What is in the CD is also worth the money. Battle of Heroes is the most impressive peice since The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme). On top of all that you get the additional DVD. That alone is worth double the price of the soundtrack for any star wars fan. The music videos are crafted perfectly. This is something no fan could pass up."
3,A little text with the music?,"I have just listened to the EPIII soundtrack and - all else aside (see other well written reviews on this site) - it is clear that there is more choral writing on this cd than any of the 5 previous. The abysmal liner notes give no clue as to what all the wailing is about. Try as I might, I am unable to detect any words, in English anyway. Does anyone know what the chorus might be saying on any given track??Thanks"
2,What the?!?,"I have to agree with ""Jase"". The person who edited this cd should be fired immediately!! I had the cd before I saw the movie so at first I thought the opening was odd but shrugged it off. At the midnight showing the severity of damage became glaringly clear. The brilliant war drum beginning was dissected out and we cut to the scene where the clones come flying down to save Obiwan's bacon..3/4 of the way through the film!! What the heck happened here?In general the cd is quite enjoyable. If similar cuts occur elsewhere I have not noticed them (yet). But it is obvious that they are going to have to do a second release similar to what was done for EP1.The bright side is the DVD. I wish they had included more artwork etc. in ALL of the segments but even so this made for a popular musical addition to my son's birthday party."
5,Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
4,Awesome!!,"the final Star Wars soundtrack, it is pretty damn awesome, and I love this soundtrack, every track. However, as with a few other albums I've purchased, some of the music you hear in the film is not available on this soundtrack. The tragic music as Padme confronts Anakin for what he's done is a big one, along with the music where Anakin and Obi Wan battle Count Dooku is amiss. However, the vast majority of the music from the film is on the CD."
2,So much is missing,"I am a diehard Star Wars fan and own all the scores. This one, though good, fell short. Take Anakin VS Obi Wan for instance, the beat just isn't there like it was in the movie, drums perhaps, and takes away the excitement contained in that scene. Later in the movie, we see Vader on the Star Destroyer and Padme's funeral, and the music isn't on this CD. Palpatine's Teachings is my favorite because it is as dark as we heard it in the movie, but a lot shorter. Granted, it took several years before all of the music was released for the original three episodes and I think that stinks. Why can't these scores be released the way we heard them in the movie and all at once?"
4,good MPS,"John Williams has made a good OMPS for Episode 3, you can feel the battles of the movies, by listening to this music. Especially cut #1. You can imagine the Jedis falling one by one in battle or against a dark Jedi. But it's a bit sad after all, like saying the Republic is losing or the Empire begins. A good music, I recommend it."
5,Brilliant.,"I especially cannot emphasize the song ""Anakin's Betrayal"" enough. The first theme of the piece is easily one of the most moving pieces from all of Star Wars, as well as one of the most wonderful things I've heard in a long time."
5,BRILLIANT!!!,"The Revenge of a Sith completes the star wars saga. This is a dark and beautiful soundtrack. It is filled with layers of themes and emotion. The previous Star Wars themes are only occasionally weaved into the music, so most of it is original. -that's actually good because John Williams hits a home-run with this one!!! I have many of the other Star Wars soundtracks, and this is my favorite. It has a depth of sound and artistry that goes beyond the others.The biggest surprise was the DVD music video collection that was included. You have music and video clips from all 6 movies that are introduced by the ""emperor"" himself! This was a nice bonus. The DVD alone is worth the money."
4,Another Star Wars Masterpeice,"After seeing the movie for the third time, I realized that it just wouldn't be what it is today without John Williams' masterpeice score. I still cant get Battle of the Heroes out of my head. All of the tracks are easily played for your personal use. I, personally listen to General Grievous every day driving to work. ""A musical Journey"" was a magnificent film that picked the best scenes from all of the movies and put them to the most appropriate Star Wars theme music. The only complaint that I have is that there was only 15 tracks, low for a soundtrack."
4,"Rise, Lord Vader....","The final chapter in the Star Wars saga has drawn to a close. And without John Williams' fine score, it wouldn't have come out as well as it did. The score contains trace elements of the familiar themes we've known since Episode 4, such as the Force, Princess Leia's, Luke's, and the legendary 'Imperial March', Darth Vader's motif. Even the Emperor's motif appears here - the sinister, low brass & bassoon cue. Williams has an amazing talent for scoring to suit the events in the films he has written for, from 'Jaws' & 'Jaws 2' to 'Superman: The Movie', to this one. 'The Immolation' is quite chilling as it shows Anakin's horrifying defeat at the hands of Obi-Wan, and his wounds that will necessitate his transformation - which appears in track 14. Here, the operating room is viewed as Anakin ceases to exist & becomes the black-suited, heavy-breathing Darth Vader we have known since Episode 4. The only reason this score gets 4 stars is that some of the cues are missing."
5,The Emerald of John Williams: Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"I just couldn't miss it. I have to say a word about this divine music that completes the brilliancy never heard before: six wonderful sci-fi movies with six amazing sound tracks. I just happen to know that it is John Williams, who has founded this fashion in pedestaling OST as high as the movie itself. The more you listen to it the more you like it. I can't stop playing it back over and over again. You could easily recognize the themes that are to be developed in episodes IV, V, and VI and I am simply amazed how naturally it follows. The DVD is a bonus to all the fans of us. I'm looking forward to buying the full (2CD set) of this, as well as Episode II sound tracks.A must have one!!!"
5,Excellent Soundtrack and Awesome DVD!,"Naturally, this soundtrack is a must for any Star Wars or John Williams enthusiast. I have all the other Star Wars soundtracks, so I had to get this one. Like all the others, this one doesn't contain all the music from the film, but what you do get is great. All the major themes are offered here in an excellent recording. I think the track for the ending credits sounded a lot different than I remember from the film, but it's still good.The bonus DVD makes this soundtrack really worth buying! I had not expected a DVD as part of the package, but I was thrilled to have it. It offers most of the saga's musical themes with accompanying scenes from all six movies. It's only about an hour long, but it's dazzling. If you love John Williams' work, then you'll find the DVD to be a real treat."
1,Parenting in the Twenty-First Century,"I have taken several parenting classes and expected there would be some of that valuable information I learned in those classes in this book, however this book does not detail any parenting techniques. Instead it speaks of the many different situations you might find yourself in, details the categories families fall into, but offers little real training for how to handle the situations or prevent them in the first place. I expected to see some detailed practical techniques that would help me deal with behaviour problems. Why is that kind of material missing in a book with this title? Also, I think this book suggested not less than 25 times that you should seek professional counseling, perhaps that is the main aim of this book, to get more people into counceling? Basically a whole lot of fluff, and not enough meat!"
3,For Hard Core Tolkien Fans Only!!!,"I got the book thinking it was part of Tolkien's unfinished sequel to the LOTR ""The Return of the Shadow"", but the shadow here is Sauron's return to middle earth after the end of the second age.This is a volume in the previously unpublished letters and papers of J.R.R. Tolkien. In this volume we follow the evolution of the different parts of the LOTR the Fellowship of the Ring over time. From its beginning as a sequel to the Hobbit to the final epic product of mythic proportions.Its interesting to see all the various drafts of the original chapters and the progression of Bingo Baggins into Frodo and the Hobbit Trotter into the Human King Strider/Aragorn. But this is the main drawback also, how many variations of ""A Long Expected Party"" can one read without being bored?For Tolkien enthusiatists and English Majors only."
2,Not too happy,"I never expected the book to be in mint condition, but I never expected the pages to start falling out! The condition listed was 'used' or something to that effect, but I think there should have been a little more consideration put into the condition of the book. I think that about half of the book has fallen out now because the binding was shot on it. On the other hand, it wouldn't have been so disappointing had I expected it, so I would just say take a little more time to look over your products before you go describing them as better than what they really are."
4,Six episodes. Lots of fun!,"There are six episodes on this DVD that are a lot of fun. Being a fan of KISS, and especially of Gene Simmons, I enjoyed the interview with him that is an extra on the DVD. Fun for me and my daughter. Well worth it."
5,The title says it all...,"This is, without doubt, the best book on backpacking I've read. Just the right balance between specific recommendations and general advice, objective information and personal opinion."
2,A good book but not much new here.,"Having previously bought a copy of the second edition of the Backpackers Handbook some years ago, I found it to be a very informative book and a great help for hiking. A few years having passed, I thought the newer version would be more up to date and informative, as advertised. I was disappointed to find the book was basically not much more than a reprint of the 2nd edition and in my opinion, not worth the money. It contains only a very small amount of new information, in fact most chapters are verbatim or very close to verbatim repeats of the second edition. Less than impressed."
4,Great Book,"I have read through this book and i must say it was full of really useful infromation. I am a new backpacker and i'm planning my first trip through the smoky mountains. It had really valuable info, but i would say that it is more of a read through than a field guide. I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,Average. It could have been excellent.,"There is a lot of detail in this book. I cannot strongly recommend it though because there isn't that much that is unique. It isn't bad. It just isn't great. In part, the author suffers from being knowledgeable of the past but not the present gear, clothing, or technology. The author researched enough to find out about what is now available, but it often appears as though he has only read about it on the Internet or in product literature. A quick example is the utility of a GPS. He mentions his own heavy weight relic and also the lightweight Garmin Geko. He considers a GPS an interesting gadget but he doesn't know how to really take advantage of a GPS combined with topographic mapping software for pre-trip planning and route finding. The old heavyweight relic of a GPS that the author has, gets the most coverage in the text and he simply mentions he might use a GPS more, if he had a Geko."
1,Not Impressed....,"Overall I am not impressed with this book. topics are way to wordy and don't get to the point. ultimately it feels like author justification for new editions by simply adding to the word count and no to the total value the work provided. If you're looking for an appointed wordy work, this is for you. if you want something that cuts to the point, keep looking."
5,"Backpacker's Handbook, views from a scouting dad.","With backpacking and camping gear changing all the time, it is great to have a reference like this. I recommend this book to all the scouting dads out there who would like something that goes deeper than the BSA information available. When you have a group of boys that you are responsible for, being prepared is crucial. This reference breaks down different types of outings, brings up things you never thought about and ties it all together. I've found that my trips go smoother. We bring less but have the right stuff. Get the book..."
