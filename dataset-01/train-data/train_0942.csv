4,Well-Fleshed Out Characters,"at the end of the book, i wanted more. that's how i know if i like a book. cared about katinka, even though she drove me nuts sometimes. could ms. medwed write a sequel please!"
4,This one will keep you laughing.,"I stumbled upon this book by accident. I was unaware of the Cambridge, MA locale when I began reading, but being familiar with the places mentioned definitely added to my enjoyment. Besides that, this is a thoroughly enjoyable read about someone in their early 30's who is trying to decide what they want in life. The story line and writing style reminded me a little of Stephen McCauley. Check this one out."
2,Vague and difficult to stick with.,I had high hopes for this book because of the popularity of the author but I found it to be hard to follow and scattered. There is little cohesion to keep the reader's interest.
5,Great book,This book helped me in a time in my life when I went through alot of changes. I highly recommend.
2,Book was not what I expected it to be reading the chapter,Book ordered used was in old condition. Melody Beattie is the best. Always write the most wonderful introductions. Gave to family member.
4,Choices: Taking Control of Your Life and Making It Matter,"Melody Beattie has chosen the narrative approach in this self-help book, instead of a direct counseling approach. She describes many real life situations and then helps the reader find where a choice was made. This allows the reader to identify with situations which they have experienced and perhaps not seen where a choice seemed possible.The book is a great follow-on to her earlier, more direct book: Co-Dependent No More."
5,Madea,I love this package deal. I only wish it was available in Blu Ray. Tyler Perry is amazing in his plays.
5,My family Loved It!!!,"We had family over for Christmas and we all sat up and watched the entire set in one sitting. My aunt loves this set! I might surprise her with it next Christmas. (The price hike after Christmas is crazy though, so I might wait for it to go back down). Excellent product!!! Keep up the great work Tyler Perry!"
5,Angelique'-Olivia,"What can I say? Mister Tyler Perry is the man. I'm an New Orleans native myself and I can relate to all of Tyler Perry stage plays and movies. I love his character Madea, That lady character he plays will be sure to remind you of someone in your family that keeps the family together as well as make the family laugh because they are so out spoken and get straight to the point. Maybe the person is your great grandmother, grandmother, aunt, mother, sister or older cousin. Madea is every woman. lol I love Tyler Perry, continue successfully and may JAH bless. Tyler Plays are a must see for the family and friends."
5,Soul lifting!!!!!!!!,This product is awesome. Many laughs in each dvd and always a problem that you can relate to and understand and by the end of the movie you feel like your soul has been lifted to higher ground and makes me just want to go out there and spread the lifting power to everyone around me. My kids love to watch the dvds and now know all the words to the songs and my son loves Mr. Brown and his dancing moves....this set will stay in this family for generations to come!!! Thanks Tyler for creating something thats great for everyone in my family!!!
3,Mottled Lizard,"Interesting biograghy of Elspth Huxley's childhood in Africa.Well written, as all of Huxley's books are. Some of the same people from Out of Africa and White Mischief, folks with too much money having too much fun!"
3,Not what Was offered for Sale,The item I ordered was Memorex CD-R 50 pack spindle and what I got was COMPUSA CD-R 50 pack
4,Blank CDs? I HAVE NEVER SEEN THOSE BEFORE!,"Just another generic pack of blank CDs... but hey, blank CDs are awesome, so they get a 4. I think Memorex is cool because that's what brand the majority of my blank CDs are. Also notice that these are EIGHTY minutes rather than SEVENTY-TWO or SEVENTY-FOUR as in some other blank CDs. That means you can fit an extra song or two, depending on length of the song."
1,they changed them,"I had found these blanks very very reliable. They changed them now though, out of my last 3 (which were my only 3) packs of cds, i had not had one defective cd. In the pack that i just bought from here i have already hat about 7 defectives out of the 20 ive used. You should really find a better brand now because they have been ruined."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I have been using Memorex brand DVD's for years and have never had a problem. These CD's however are JUNK! I can only get 1 out of 5 to successfully burn using nero. My Plextor 708 burner won't even recognize the blank discs. My newer Plextor 716 SATA drive will fail 1 out 5 times. I keep up to date on firmware and these are top of the line drives! I have burned hundreds of DVD's and I can count the coasters on one hand. I have thrown away 10 discs already. WHAT A HEADACHE, WASTE OF MONEY & TIME! THE REST ARE GOING IN THE TRASH AND I WILL ONLY BUY VERBATIM FROM NOW ON!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I bought a 10 pack of this particular brand, and I was thoroughly disappointed. Not one cd out of the 10 could burn properly, I had to trash every last one of them. I checked for file corruption, compatibility with my burner, etc...none of that was the problem. I got a bad batch of cd's...now I can understand 1 or 2 cd's being bad out of, maybe 50....but 10 out of 10? That's totally unacceptable.I'm with the other user, I'm sticking to Sony from now on. I usually use Sony and went the cheaper route with Memorex and ended up paying anyway. Stick with Sony, they are more reliable and compatible."
5,Wonderful.,Works perfectly fine for me. I have burned a few CD's already and there aren't any problems so far. =)
2,Not good for video!,"I purchased these Memorex CD-R for primarily using them to burn movies in svcd format. Using 24x write from my 48x burner, the first 4 discs has many skips and freezes throughtout the length of the movies. One disc even has the subtitle frozen in one place for the entire movie. Meanwhile, the same movies I burned with the same speed using TDK 48X CD-R would play flawlessly. I have not used these Momorex CD-R for any data backup yet, so I can't comment on that."
2,Half of it didn't work,I tried to burn maybe 25 CD's. Half of it didnt work. I wasted my money. Choose another brand. I don't know how to return those without paying shipping fee.
3,not satisfied,Not all of the cd's worked when I tried to copy pics/songs over to the cd from my macbook. Not sure why?
4,"Works well, a nice product","I've bought these CD's for my father for Christmas the last few years. He enjoys making his own CD's, so these are a big hit!"
1,Spend the extra money for something else,"I've never had trouble with burning CDs until I bought these. The last set I bought skipped in my car and no burned CD had ever done that before. I said I would never buy them again, but since there was a really good price for a pack of 50, I bought it, thinking that maybe I had just had a defective batch the previous time. Well I burned two CDs on my computer and when I went to play them, nothing was there. The CD just did not burn. About 2 minutes later I used one of my old Maxell CDs and it worked fine. I will never buy anything from Memorex again."
1,Horrible . .,"I archive backups to my system on these and so fill the disks to capacity.Every time I tried to fill a disk it would fail.This is trash.BTW, I tried them on my wife's laptop and same thing."
1,Quality has declined,"I bought a spindle of these in 2004 and had no real problems with them. In December 2005 I bought a new 50-pack and noticed that the CDs smelled of solvent or plasticizer and had irregular, lumpy edges. I've had errors on each of the first five discs I have attempted to burn. With my previous batch I had a very low error rate. Unless Memorex raises their QC standards I would recommend trying your luck with a different manufacturer. With an 0 for 5 record so far, I have to give this product one star."
1,Better quality CD-Rs are out there,"This is my experience: I was making a few CDs and noticing that many of the songs I recorded on them, particularly those at the end of the disc, skipped and popped a lot, basically rendering the whole CD worthless. After spending several hours rebooting my machine and checking all of the hardware to see what the problem was, I figured I'd try another brand of CD-Rs and eureka! I was able to churn out a bunch of CDs with no problems whatsoever.It's a bit surprising that a brand name like this puts out such low-quality CD-Rs. I ended up throwing away at least half of these CD-Rs I tried to record before just pitching the entire spindle after I got this other brand.So if you're having trouble burning CDs, check what kind of disc you are using first before wasting time checking to make sure your computer equipment is okay."
5,Good producy,I have used Memorex discs before & never have an issue with them. Would recommend as the price is good also.
1,memorex cd's are terrible!,"A friend of mine told me not to buy Memorex brand, because he had bad luck with them, but I bought them because they were cheaper. I should havbe listened to him... I purchased this brand of blank cd's, and every time I try to burn a cd with them, it pops out and says, ""an unknown error has occurred"". I wasted my money. Any other brand works for me, except this one."
1,Memorex is a great brand... These disks... Not so much.,"At first I thought the disks worked just fine. Then after a few disks they stopped reading well, and started to fail completely. Had the return window not expired I would have sent them back. I've had memorex disks before so this would be the first time they have ever let me down."
1,Poor quality,after about 5 failed burn attemps I was inspected these cd-r discs only to find little bubbles on the top of the cd and every single one of them is like this. Do these guys at memorex even inspect these plastic turds???! dont buy this brand youre better off with maxell or sony even phillips. Ive never seen anything like this garbage!
1,Lost most of my music collection,"I was going to wipe my computer and downgrade to XP so I decided to back up my music. I burned most of my music to Memorex CD-Rs and checked the first 3 or 4 to be sure things were burning properly. Nero said they were successfully burnt! Later I was able to score a few DVDs so I didn't have to use so many CDs, THANKFULLY. Because after I wiped my computer and went to get my music back from the Memorex CD-Rs I couldn't! Over half the discs were defective. The defective ones would only show the first folder on the disk and the other ones come up as ""file not found"" when I search for them in the Command line. These CDs are junk. This is not the first time that Memorex has screwed me but it is the last."
1,Crap Shoot,"My first spindle of these worked flawlessly. My second spindle of these didn't seem to work at all on the same drive. Bizarrely, when I took a set of CD's to another computer, they worked great, so I figured it was my drive. Unfortunately, after buying a new drive, they didn't work on that, either.Based on the other reviews being super positive and super negative, I'm thinking that the quality control on these things is pretty horrible. Entire spindles of bad CD's may be being shipped, as are entire spindles of great ones. My advice - don't waste your money."
4,Good Product,"I know a lot of people have problems with this media, but I have used many of them and I am very satisfied. I wish they could do something about the occasional surface defects (which don't seem to be a problem), but what product is perfect."
2,PLEASE!! CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND,"Didn't have trouble w/ these until right now, I tried burning on CDs from pack of 5 that I bought this morning and none of them work!! I just submitted a warranty claim w/ memorex and am requesting a refund NOT replacement.I've also had problems w/ Memorex CDRWs of 12x and 24x speeds, especially the 24x speed. I have over five of them that recorded well initially but then couldn't open them ever w/ any computer. Lost a semester's worth of data!! Geez."
1,MrThor,"Note to self: Never buy these blank CDs again. You might save a buck or two, but that doesn't matter much when only 15 per cent of the CDs work. I used Windows Media Player to burn some music CDs, and out of 15 discs only two worked. The others? Windows Media Player kindly asked me to ""try another brand"". And I bet you, I will."
3,CDs are CDs,"CDs are CDs, but I should have bought more at one time instead of scrimping on pennies. Go for the bigger pack. You'll eventually go through it."
3,These recordable disks are no thte best,These recordable disks seem to have a lot of duds in the pack. I get them frequently and always have a few per pack that wont burn.
1,Horrible,"I purchased two different versions of Memorex's CD-R's (one spindle of 50 with the plain grey face and another 50 with a metallic-blue color) and neither works on three different CD/DVD writers: an HP 740b, an LG GSA-H55L or an LG GE20LU10. I have wasted God-knows-how-many discs trying to successfully burn a data CD disc but no success thus far. They just will not burn a disc successfully, and I've tried multiple popular CD bruneing software apps. Maybe that's why they were on sale when I bought them? BUYER BEWARE!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I have experienced a failure rate of about 25% with these CDs. I haven't had them long enough to judge their quality over time, but the level of quality I have seen so far doesn't bode well for that area either."
1,They're Cheap for a Reason,"I should have known better. After seeing these in the store, a bundle of so many for just $20 seemed like such a steal. Actually, it would have been more beneficial to just set a twenty dollar bill ablaze. None of the cds I tried to make, worked. No, not one of them. It doesn't have anything to do with my burner, either. Every other type of disc I've ever used (and I have tried them all) has worked just great. Not only that, but this has happened to several relatives as well. We don't all have incompatible burners (which wouldn't make sense anyway, a cd such as this shouldn't be unique to any one type of burner), the bundle is just awful."
1,Don't work in Philips CDRecorder Unit,"I bought these from another seller. Only 3-4 of the disks worked in my Philips CDR800 CD recorder. Even the ones that worked had issues--i.e., I had to reboot the CD recorder after finalizing."
2,High Failure Rate,I have always been happy with Verbatim but I assumed that cds were a commodity item. That is until I tried Memorex and had 2 failures in the first 25 disks. A failure rate of 8% is ridiculous.
4,A good medium to store your data.,"One day soon, the CD-R's will be obsolete. With the advent of larger USB sticks and DVD burning almost to an exact science, the usefulness of these is coming to an end."
1,Half Don't Record,"Unfortunately, I purchased ""two"" spindles of 50 Memorex Music 80 minute CD-R and about every other disc had to be thrown away as it would start burning my music, then just get hung-up and stop. To get the disc ejected, I would have to close down the Real Player completely and on a few occasions, shut-down my computer and re-start it. Although my computer is newer, I had put a cleaning disc in it, thinking that maybe there was some lint, but that didn't help. Thinking ""I"" was doing something wrong, I started talking to other people about my problem and found-out that they have had the same problems.I'm not wasting anymore money buying and throwing away Memorex discs."
3,"Friendlier Shipping, PLEASE","Please include an option for having the delivery service leave it!I work most days, when deliveries occur (not unique), so I can't be home when they try to deliver. So for 3 days (working!, not including weekends) my package was in this loop. After which I had 5 days to drive 20 miles to the hub to pick it up, that's about $8 in gas! more than the price of the purchase, I said then I will never buy from Amazon again. Then I figured out what the problem was, it was not Amazon, but UPS, they could have left it, but chose not to, even though I requested it!!! and signed the sticky note to have them just leave it, So........ Please put an option to the purchaser to have the item left if the purchaser chooses and accepts responsibly. Until then I will not buy anything from Amazon because it cost so much more in time and effort than buying it at the most expensive brick and mortar. UPS is KILLING your Business model!PS the product was fine"
1,These suck!!!,I am trying to burn data cd's and have gotten 1 to partially work out of 6. A real waste of money and time. I'm now down to trying 8X speed.
2,"Great Price, not a lot","Every other cd on my spindle has had an error when writing to disc. Maybe I just got a defective pack, but my trashcan is now full of unusable cds.If you need 50 cds, buy the 100 pack so you'll actually get them."
1,I want my money back...,"I was so upset with this CD's beacuse from the 50 CD's only 25 worked perfectly while burning it, last time i bought TDK isntead and they worked perfectly for everything. DON'T BUT THIS! iT WILL GET YOU SO ANGRY WITH YOU AND WITH EVERYONE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
1,"Thought it was my burner, but....","I have used Memorex in the past with no problems. I bought a couple 50 packs spindles and burned abour 20 of them with no problem. Then the next one failed at he beginning of recording, and the next and the next and the next. In all, I have had about 15 failures in a row on both my laptop and desktop computers. At first, I thought my burner went bad, but I tried some Fuji disks that I had (recording the same thing) and they worked every time. I can not record any music or data files on these Memorex disks. Even if Memorex would replace them, I want something I can trust."
1,Complete Junk,These blank cds were almost half off all the others. I just figured they were on sale and had no idea they were unloading a faulty product. They are terrible! I've wasted a lot of time burning these cds just to throw them out. About every 5th or 6th disk makes a playable cd.
1,Got defective batch?,"About half of the 50 CDs I got where defective. They worked well up to 400MB, but the last files recorded on the CDs would be corrupted if recording to full capacity. Unfortunately I discovered this only by losing some data. Maybe I just got a defective batch, but I won't buy Memorex CD-Rs again."
1,Worst CD-R's EVER.,"I read some positive reviews and thought this was a good deal for such a large pack of disks but it was a WASTE OF MONEY. Out of the entire pack, I've been able to use THREE disks!!! And like someone else had mentioned, at first I thought it might be my burner, but I've tried the disks on my laptop and home computer and neither worked. I tried some other disks I had on hand and they worked just fine. And the Memorex DVD-R's I've purchased from Target work great. So not sure if this is a supplier issue or what, because I've never had issues w/Memorex like this before.Defintiely don't take the risk that these won't work for you. Go to the store, spend a couple more bucks and at least get your money's worth!"
5,"Great intro to digital, but worthwhile for experienced too","This is a great book written with obvious enthusiasm for photography, but particularly digital photography. Kubota reveals all the tips and tricks you'd ever need to make the transition from film to digital, but the book is just as useful for those already on that path who might need some structure or guidance to get organised!I found the sections on workflow to be very useful, although it does focus on one software program that not everyone will purchase. The photo effects and ideas on Photoshop actions was also excellent - it has saved me hours of time doing conversions to black & white, reducing file size for the net etc.All in all an excellent book!"
5,Another fine dance disc produced by Oakenfold and Osborne.,"Produced by the well-respected Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne, this disc gathers in several of Grace's hit singles along with several other previously unreleased tracks. A number of musical styles can be found on ""If I Could Fly,"" among them ambient and drum and bass. Grace's siren-song gives everything a cohesive feel despite the variety of styles. A majority of the album carries a high-energy pace that you can't help but dance to, but there are a few slower ballads among them. Among my favorites on the album are ""It's Not Over Yet""; ""If I Could Fly""; ""Orange"", a remix of U2's ""Lemon""; and ""Hand in Hand"". This disc is a must have for any fan of dance music."
4,"A+ for picture quality, but C- for execution","I am delighted that ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" is finally available in widescreen. It looks a lot sharper than the full-screen Good Time DVD release from several years ago. However, why doesn't the Universal release have a main menu or chapter selection option? Even at the end of the film, the disc returns to the beginning and starts playing again.I shouldn't complain, because this film looks stunning on my widescreen TV."
5,Good movie but not as kid friendly as I thought,"My kids wanted a movie about airplanes and I'd remembered watching this one when I was a kid and thinking there was lots of cool airplane stuff in it.There is.But be aware that there are a couple of crash scenes that maybe you might not want your kids to see. No reason not to buy the movie, but be aware.Other reviews here summarize the movie quite nicely, so I won't waste your time. Bottom line, I enjoyed it."
5,re: waldo pepper,I received the DVD today. Thank you so much for your kindness. I will be purchasing more videos from you in the future. great to do business with iris
5,The Real McCoy!,"This has always been one of my favorite movies, and I have waited YEARS for it to come on to DVD - frankly, I never thought it would happen! This movie is a true classic in all senses of that word - great script, fabulous acting and directing and the stunts were flown by ACTUAL STUNT PILOTS AND REAL AIRPLANES!!!!!!! NOT computer ""graphics"" and/or ""special effects""!!!!! The air stunts are amazing and you just can't ""fake"" the REAL THING! (I'm a pilot and ""real"" flying means allot to me!) Thank the Gods for finally giving us this marvelous movie on DVD!!!!!"
5,A good book clubber's choice,"A very moving tribute to an interesting historical figure.. Doris L Rich captured Amelia's spirit so well that I felt as if I were livingAmelia's life right along with her. A ""winner""... Book clubbers will enjoy it."
1,not even close to worth it,"They dont stick well. They came off in a day or two and started sticking to each other. 20$ wasted. These have one job to do and didnt do it, I give them zero stars"
5,nothing special but they work well for paper,for binders that get a lot of use they work fine and don't come off. I am not sure what other applications people are trying to use them for.Nothing fancy but they work. I have used them for about four years now.
5,It works.,"I don't care for the smell, but I find that supplementing my vet's prescription with Malacetic Otic clears up ear problems (swollen painful ears, brown gook, discolored skin/hair loss outside the ear) MUCH faster. Problems that once seemed chronic disappear quickly. (The very first time I used Malacetic Otic, my dog's condition was so severe, it took several weeks to clear. Now, if I catch things early, problems are resolved in one or two days.)"
3,"A comprehensive guide, yet lacking some vital info","A typical IBD book that covers the basis of what the medical field knows and understands about IBD. Unfortunately the book declines to investigate the options of serious diet modifications such as the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD). This diet completely reversed my severe UC and now I lead a completely new life, with lots of cooking of course. I give the book still 3 stars due to the mostly valid info on meds and what to expect from IBD diseases but wish it would have investigated other treatment plans that have proven effective for thousands.Tucker SweeneyAuthor of Two Steps Forward, One Step Back. ~A Journey Through Life~Ulcerative Colitis and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.BS Physical Education & Health"
4,Very informative,"I bought this book when diagnosed with UC and it really helped to take the fear out of the situation. When you suffer from an incurable disease you can at first feel overwhelmed but this book answers pretty much all the questions you might ask. My only reservation is that it doesn't mention the Specific Carbohydrate Diet which some people, including myself, have found extremely useful for treating IBD. Mention of the SCD would be a useful addition for any later edition."
3,I liked it,"I thought the book has some good info in it but It was not what I was looking for. I wanted to know the basics ,what is this what can I expect and what to do. I didn't find that."
5,Best Crohn's Book Available,"I have a small library of books on Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis, and this one by far offers the most updated and helpful information. Whenever I have a question about my diet, or my medication, or a new symptom, this is the first book I pull off the shelf. The book is also extremely well-written, with clear explanations of all of the medical information, and some nice personal perspectives from the author, who has Crohn's disease. If you--or a loved one--have recently been diagnosed, do yourself a favor and buy this book. When you close it, you will be a wiser and more prepared patient or caregiver than you were before you opened it."
4,Excellent for newly diagnosed,"Being myself diagnosed with UC, I found myself reading everything I could get my hands on relating to the subject. After reading many medical books on the subject, I turned to this book written by a patient herself. I found this book to be the best so far for the newly diagnosed. It really explains everything in laymans terms. Highly recommend"
4,Good for beginners,"The title clearly states ""The First Year"" but I thought, even though I was diagnosed 3 years ago, I could learn something from this book. Although I did learn a few little things, overall, the book was just a refresher for me. It would have been very beneficial to have when I was first diagnosed."
5,What happens when you are told you have Crohn's,"Doctors cannot tell it all in a few meetings, there is just too much to take in with this very sad disorder which has no cure. This book will make sense, well organized, a day and month at a time. What treatment modalities are available, included are the side effects of treatment. This book also give you hope, but there is no cure.Excellent book."
2,Disappointing,"I expected the book to answer my questions that the doctor did not have time to answer. Out of maybe 100 questions I found less than ten answered to my satisfaction. The book seems more for women than for men. There are suggestions for support, acceptance, solace, coping, and other emotional aspects that women find necessary. I wanted facts and solutions. I wanted to know if this happens do this. I won't say reading the book was a waste of time, but I found many parts boring to say the least. Combine that with the fact that the publisher did not allow the electronic copy to be loaned, and I generously gave it two stars out of five."
2,"If you've just been diagnosed, it better be Crohn's...","While I had high hopes for this new book I was very concerned about the VERY negative outlook the author gives the reader. Unless you suffer from Crohn's and a severe case at that, this book offers alot of information but little hope.If it is a your child that has been diagnosed look to Carol Svec terrific book on current medical research and help. Also Dr. Sabil book about Ulcerative Colitis is much better, as is the Guide to dealing with Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis in Children available on the CCFA website. Not all patients are as jaded as Ms.Sklar."
2,Don't plan on selling the book back,"The first time I used the book, large sections of the pages became separated from the book spine. I bought the book used, but it was in perfect condition. At first I thought it was just my book, but everyone in my class had the same problem. Now none of us sell the book back. This book was used for a second semester senior of social work, and contained a lot of redundant material.Advanced Practice in Human Service Agencies Issues, Trends, & Treatment Perspectives (Paperback, 1998)"
1,Disappointed,"I am a Christopher Lowell fan and these videos are a disappointment. First of all if you watch the show, then you've already seen the content on the DVDs. Second of all, the content is just a shortened rehash of two episodes from the Christoper Lowell Show. You will find Chistopher talking about the two rooms featured and a short demo of that. I don't feel that this DVD was worth the $20 I spent on it. If you seek details of projects and new material from Christopher, his book, Christopher Lowell's One-of-a-Kind Decorating Projects: Fast & Flexible Ways to Personalize Your Home was the best choice for me."
1,Puddle Duck ID Guide,"This isn't a book; it's more like a page from a book. It ID's only 6 different species of ducks. If you want to pay that much for a brief comment and pictures of 6 duck species, this is the item to buy. It provides good photos of male & female and has small maps of each species' range. It just ain't much."
1,Worst CD I ever bought !,"Except for the arrangement of the first tune, this CD doesn't sound German at all. It would best be described as ""elevator music"" as heard in the background in many stores and shopping malls in the U.S. On top of that, it consists of a single track of 40 minutes in length. If you were hoping to hear old German folk tunes, this is not the CD to purchase."
4,"German1 - Cornucopia of GERMAN music, OLD STYLE, STEREO","I don't know what the prior reviewer means, but this DEFINETELY *IS* German music! This sounds like a recording from the mid 40's or 50's and is in wide, CLEAR HIGH FIDELITY STEREO! The remastering of this is EXTREMELY WELL done, somebody cared to preserve this one... Yes, it IS all one track with a break at the first twenty minutes (flipped the record?) and continues another +/- 20 minutes... It is one *composition*, with melodies consisting a nonstop arrangement with nice transitions to each melody... Someone arranged these classics and put them together in this ORIGINAL recording. Has a great traditional old sound you will LOVE and it will bring back memories. This is a FULL orchestration compilation with leading strings. Many recognizable numbers tastefully arranged! Definately a four star disc. YES, it IT IS all German."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I didn't even get through the first hundred pages without finding two errors. J.E.B. Stuart was certainly not called ""Beauty"" for his ""fine appearance"" but for just the opposite reason, which is why he grew his beard. Stonewall did not hold his arm up in the air to ""call down the favor of the All Mighty"", but to keep his body in balance. If I can find two errors in the first 100 pages of an 855-page book, who knows how many are actually there."
2,somwhat interesting,"'The Longest Night' was interesting, but if you want to read a great narrative on the Civil War, read Shelby Footes three volume set of the war. It's great."
2,The Longest Read,What a monumental disappointment. This is the only book I've ever read on the Civil War that I struggled to get through. The battle narratives don't compare with the standard works. The author likes to provide lots of detail about things like brigade sizes and artillery types but then never incorporates the information by showing any significance of the information in the narrative.
4,"a deep-tissue, aural massage...","Very etheral and astral evocation, upon listening to this. Far from bubble gum happiness, but neither is it too pretentious or heavy-handed in pushing the ""hurts-so-good"" depression and melancholy; just the right mixture, with gauze-like, layer after layer of hypnotic, mesmerizing, anesthetizing texture. PErfect for the middle of a long car trip when you've exhausted the other, overly enthusiastic stuff. Perfect for those overcast days, when a fire is a-blazin' in the fireplace, and a light snow is drifting. You get the picture..."
2,ok movie not great,this movie was ok. but nothing and i mean nothing can compare with sweet hostage. i give sweet hostage 5 stars. i wish i can give it 10. if you are a linda blair fan like i am sweet hostage is the best movie she made. i have everyone of her movies but sweet hostage is my favorite and now they just released it on dvd. i bought two of them.
1,boring,this movie is very dated very boring to watch i usually like linda blair movies but come on this movie could have been better the rape seen isnt graphic i wasnt expecting a porn flick but the camera raped her not the girls in detention hall like i said i think its boring you can see for yourself
4,great for old infants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would give it 5 stars, but it is rather small. I expected it to be a tad larger.My 8 1/2 months old is in love with it. She has joined Gymboree & I am trying to expand her musical horizon. She just makes the best music with it. Come to think of it, it is good for her hands (the right size). So I do give it a 4 1/2 stars ;)"
1,Poor quality,"If you want to help kids learn through music, the music needs to be engaging; if you want to help older kids learn through music, the music had better win their respect as by then they have developed musical tastes. This CD sounds as if it was produced by someone with a cheap Casio keyboard in his basement and the music is amateurish. There is just one song (sung by kids) which is repeated for each of the tables -- which negates the entire point, namely that kids can learn a song and learn a table. Here one song is associated with all of the tables. The 12 and 13 year old I bought this for gave it a disdainful sniff and it was put aside. Give this a pass."
2,Green Boy,"Trey, who is 12, and his muted brother, Lou, who is 7, are hanging around by a pond in the Bahamas. It seems like such a normal thing but they somehow enter a somewhat scary new world called Pangaia. It is very dirty and is filled with buildings. The brothers come back to this mysterious place various times in this book. They face many unusual things throughout this book, which if you want to know you may read this book.Now to some people this may seem exciting, but to me, not really. It is a somewhat well written book but it is a little bit too... hard to explain but environment obsessed. I had to keep myself reading this book, which is never fun. If you are going to read a fantasy or Science Fiction book, I would not recommend this being your answer."
5,Not Flamenco. It's NEW Flamenco!!!,"Traditional flamenco has never been more popular than it is today and it is here to stay. This is due in large part to the growth and expansion of the genre over the last decade. The ""new flamenco"" music on this CD is an important branch of this development and it should be applauded."
4,Nice collection of flamenco music,"Purchased for a friend, who reports that it is a nice collection of flamenco music."
1,Arrogance and lies,"'Pure flamenco happens to be repetitive, woefully simple background music for flamenco dancers''straight flamenco is great for a dance show, but it has never made it as a succesful solo instrumental genre''the pure flamenco guitarists who are relegated to performing strictly in Spanish restaurants like animatronic museum dummies'-----------------These statements just sums up the total lack of understanding and knowledge about flamenco among the followers of this selfproclaimed 'new flamenco'...P>Vicente Amigo is a modern flamencoguitarist that makes this bunch looks like beginners. And any young guitarist in the REAL 'new flamenco' generation (the spanish version) is a far better alternative to this lot.And i can assure you that Vicente is NOT 'relegated to performing strictly in Spanish restaurants'"
1,"Junk, avoid","There is no Flamenco on this CD, these are pop impressions of Flamenco having no similarity to the Andalusian culture it tries to imitate. If I am humming a ""Verdi like tune"" does that mean it was somehow written by Giuseppe Verdi? Of course not. Buy something by Paco de Lucia, Vincente Amigo, or El Viejin, and show your friends that you have some taste and sophistication. This CD is strictly for the Yanni crowd."
1,"If this is flamenco, Lawrence Welk was a jazz great","Calling this crap ""flamenco"" is like calling a Beavis and Butthead movie ""Shakespearean."" But Beavis and Butthead don't have to misrepresent what they do in order to get their laughs. So ask yourself: Why does this genre of whatever-it-is (its ""artists"" obviously don't know themselves) have to prepetually misrepresent itself as something it is not - if not to get a recognition and to acquire sales to which it is in no wise entitled?..."
1,The Best of New Flamenco ?,"'New Flamenco' is a term that originated outside the whole Flamenco community. It's a term that confuses people totally because it has nothing to do with Flamenco at all. There is nothing innovative about it - it's just a very superficial muzak that uses the term flamenco to sell records.When young artists from Spain nowadays mix modern influenses they do it on a foundation and an understanding of the forms, the rythms and 'el cante'. (Which neither the followers or artists of this *New Flamenco' seem to know anything about)This is the real 'new flamenco' - it's based on a culture and the original feeling is still there despite a more modern approach.The 'New Flamenco' as represented by people like liebert, cook is something that is regarded with disgust among the flamenco guitarists in spain.- They dont claim to make 'new country' and make millions out of that."
1,A Great Disappointment,"I bought the book based on positive reviews, but was truly disappointed. Other than the dividing of the history of food into eight ""themes"" there is little intellectual content here. It reads as if the author's note cards were sorted into eight ""bins"" and a paragraph written for each card. The history of food may indeed be an interesting story, but you wouldn't guess it from reading this book. I was expecting much more."
3,amazon never delivered!,"This is a great book although, amazon never delivered. I had ordered this book 2 weeks before school(along with 2 other books for school), it never came. Amazon said that i have an ""undeliverable"" address, but when i ordered it from ebay i got it in 3 dAys! Then i had to wait forever for a refund!"
4,Delicious food for thought,"""Near a Thousand Tables: A History of Food"" by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto is a very concise treatment of food, the most basic of human necessities yet one which has been generally overlooked by historians. The first half of the book, which looks at the oldest (mostly pre-historic) food traditions, was the most interesting for this reader. Fernandez-Armesto serves up some interesting ""food for thought"" on nearly every page, starting with the fact that oysters are just about the only food that is still commonly consumed live in modern times, then some thoughts about what may have been the first animals to be domesticated and raised for food. The sections dealing with human's transition from hunting to husbandry and gathering to agriculture are insightful. The author's command of the various literature related to food (not often combined in one text) is impressive."
3,Overwrought,"I found this book as overdone and dry as a steak left in the broiler too long. What some reviewers call ""erudite"" I call boring, irrelevant, and stuffy. For example, the author devotes many pages to the topic of cannibalism, and he manages even to make this as boring as writing about boiled potatoes. Here's a sample from the cannibalism section: ""Is it part of the histoire de l'alimentation - a feeding practice designed to supply eaters with protein? Or does it belong to the history of food, as presented in this chapter - a ritual practiced not for a meal but for its meaning, nourishment for more than material effect?"" And that's one of the more livelier sentences. My history book club chose this book, but none of us could get past the second chapter. I'd rather eat this book than read it."
4,Much better than original,"The new mount design seems much more robust than the original. The plastic is not as brittle and the zip-tie slots appear to be better engineered than the mount it originally shipped with in 2008. Time will tell if this is truly an upgrade, but it looks promising."
3,Warning: not compatible with Edge 500,"While item description simply says something along the lines of ""extra bike mount for Edge GPS units"", this bike mount is *not* compatible with Edge 500. For Edge 500, you'll need Quarter Turn Bike Mount (part number 010-11430-00). This bike mount and quarter turn mount are completely different and incompatible mounting systems. Note that Edge 500 comes with two bike mounts in the box (it doesn't say anywhere in the description or on the box, but I got two, and saw reports from other people that got two too), so if you only need two, you don't need to order extra one.I gave it neutral three stars (it's required field), though I haven't actually used the item (I have Edge 500)."
1,Terrible mount for great bike computer,"I guess Garmin isn't reading reviews on Amazon or just doesn't care that they're making a piece of junk. If the only way to secure a very expensive computer to a bicycle is with a cheap piece of (overpriced) plastic, then the computer should at least come with a short tether, so it doesn't get lost when the plastic attachment unit inevitably breaks. If I didn't like everything else about the 705 so much, I'd advise against buying one, just for this reason."
1,"this sucks, my garmin edge 305 fall of mi mtb in the middle of the woods,,,,good by to US$350,,,,","this sucks, my garmin edge 305 fall of mi mtb in the middle of the woods,,,,bye bye my US$350 gps,,,,"
1,Wrong product,This product should be more clearly labeled as it CANNOT be used with ANY newer Garmin Edge products. The newer Edge models use a different mounting system altogether. This products listing should be labeled for or at least list the EXACT Garmin Edge products that were designed to work with it.
2,Zip ties scratch quadriceps,"The sharp edges of the zip ties will leave nasty scratches on your quads when you peddle out of the saddle. The new rubber band mount is an improved design, but I do not believe it is backwards compatible with my Edge 705."
1,Very poor design,"I agree with the other one star ratings, except that one star is one too many. Unfortunately if you want to use your Edge on a bicycle, you have to have one of these. I have now broken three and I cannot figure out how not to break them. The tab that holds the unit in place is so fragile that a little bumping will break it off.Bad job - Garmin. Fix it."
1,Handle bar mount doesn't handle much stress - don't waste your $,"I bought this replacement mount in early April. Less than 2 months later, the clip on the mouht that holds the GPS to it broke, just like the original.They may make a decent GPS, but this doesn't say much for Garmin's accessories. A real rip-off."
3,"Works, for a while.","If your are a Garmin edge owner than you no doubt are familiar with this little mount. This small plastic mount with it's even smaller plastic clip, is all that keeps your expensive gps attached to your bike. While the design works and feels solid when attached, the design does have a fatal flaw. Its that darn plastic flex clip that breaks over time. When this clip breaks, there is nothing to secure your edge gps. I have looked high and low for a redesigned or third party product that could replace this part, but have not had any luck. This kit included only one mounting clip , so it is not a bad idea to keep an extra on on hand for when (not if) it breaks. The price has come down a bit since I originally began buying these."
2,Works But Breaks Easily,This is the third time in 2 years I'm buying one of these things. My computer went flying out of the cradle the last time. Wish there was a more durable one out there!
3,Works great but breaks in 3 months,The tab that holds the GPS on breaks off too easy but it worked great until then!
4,It works well!,Got three of these -- at a very good unit price from Amazon -- so I could quickly move my Garmin Edge 705 from bike to bike.They function well and can also be stem mounted.
4,Works as expected but could be a better design,Works as expected but could be a better design. I've gone through a few of these because the plastic catch eventually fatigues & snaps off. Garmin should have designed it better in the first place.
2,Garmin Handle Bar Mount,"I only bought this item, because the original one doesn't resist the vibration during the rides. If you ride on an irregular floor (even for a road bike, after hundred miles (less de 1.000 miles)the base brokes. So you have to fix it using several ""no-originals ways"" waiting the new HBM arrives."
1,demaciaso simple,"Me pareció que para ser un producto original Garmin dejo mucho que desear, por que es demaciado simplona al punto que no me dio confianza como para arriesgar mi 550t en esa base."
2,Garmin Bike computer with GPS,"I would not recommend this product. You realy do not need this. I have a polar HR that does just fine, similarly priced. Sadly my polar is not compatible with this puppy so I would have to wear two transmitters if I want to use them both. And in choosing, I would choose polar anytime. Software for the PC is goofy and just about better than useless. I would not waste my money on this until they bring out a better design."
1,Misleading info on Amazon,"I did a search on Amazon for a Garmin Edge 305 handlebar mount, and it came up with this product. I looked the specs and it just said it was for Garmin Edge devices.... but it does NOT work with my 305... wrong size and shape."
2,the release tab does break,"The other reviewers are right -- the bike computer is excellent, the clip that holds it to the handlebar is junk, to put it kindly, and Garmin does nothing about it. The tab that locks it on breaks after a few months, summer or winter. Garmin not only wants $13 for it, they want$8.00 to ship it. When you pay a couple of hundred for the gadget you expect something better than this. I am working on making my own clip so I don't contribute to supporting their continuing extortion-- the clip can't cost more than 50 cents to make"
2,"Have 7 of them, on 6 bikes, all had the tab broken off. Using the 8th now on one bike","I have 7 or 8 of them on 6 different bikes. Not sure why the tabs come off. Could even be the fault of the guy that cleans the bike.But I am engineer enough to invent two little stops that prevents the tab from getting over-stretched, and a little reinforcement of the tab. If we don't go all the way and just use better material. How much would a piece of fiberglass reinforcement costIt seems to me that the stuff ages. Maybe they break off more easily after a few years.Well, if you need it, then you need to buy it. Note they can also be used to attach the non-widescreen car gps's to the bike"
1,Flimsy mount,Just want to reiterate what other reviewers have mentioned. The quality of the latch that holds the unit in place will break quickly. For me it was literally less then a few minutes after mounting it on my stem. It broke after taking my edge 705 on and off the mount. Absolutely a piece of junk. I will put some sticky tack on my unit to hold it place. Not going to waste anymore money on this POS by GARMIN. The quality of this item should be an embarrassment to them.
4,It is what it claims to be,"I'm pleased with the mount. It is set up to allow the user to mount the Garmin cycle computer on the handle bar or on a tube perpendicular to the handle bar, such as the handle bar stem. There is a slight angle built in to the rubber mount that allows you to choose to tip the unit slightly toward you or away from you when mounting it on a tube perpendicular to the handlebar. The fit with the Garmin is as good as the factory mount that came with the Garmin."
5,Classics for comfort,"Those remembering these books from childhood, and the rush to read Their Story as soon as we learn a new friend's birthday, will enjoy revisiting these classic tales and morality themes. These are snippets that withstand the test of time and situation, especially when the reader adds the appropriate conversational drama. Great for visiting Grandparents to read to the kids, or the kids to practice their reading to mom and dad, or the parents to use for bedtime, away from the television and the mental clatter of flashy games. Each day has a story, and the repetition is even soothing if they are used year after year. This is a family event, not just a book."
3,Good book for about to be marrieds and newlyweds,"A good effort but they need more information on combination gifts and on other types of relationships. However, their information on marriage is sound their personal insights invaluable."
4,Helps with Itchiness,I use this on one of my Westies who has allergies to just about everything.We bath her with the Malaseb shampoo every two weeks or so and use the spray in between on her paws and any spots she might have. She was losing a bit of fur and between the shampoo and this she is much better.Yeast is a problem and this spray is handy to keep the problem in check.
5,Use Between Bathing,I use Malaseb shampoo on my dog and between baths I use this spray. It keeps down the amount of times he needs bathed. It takes off the pollen and other things that he allergic to.
4,For Your Dog's Itchiness,I've tried the shampoo and ear cleaner and thought I'd give the spray a try. Seems to help.
4,A story worth telling and reading,"Podhoretz writes with intimacy and frankness. His experience as the child of Jewish immigrants growing up in Brooklyn and ultimately becoming a conservative is what should be a logical conclusion of so many more lives than New York peer pressure typically allows. A great example of someone with the wisdom to get past the elitist hangups of the NYC intelligentsia who instead followed his heart to the truth. A gentle read, and an overall pleasure!"
1,No content,"Lots of personal stories, well and amusingly told, but not one bit of specific, useful content. Don't know anything more about screenplays than before I bought it, except that they have a beginning, middle and end."
1,"Bad software; didn't work, and no refund given","I am not one to write reviews but this software was so bad I just had to warn the rest of you. Situation: I was having hard drive problems and searched a search engine for a software to help me out. I paid for HARD DRIVE MECHANIC GOLD and not only didn't it work with my system, but I requested a refund within about 2 hours, and they never even RESPONDED. Bad software, and just as bad is the customer support (or lack thereof). So I can't get my money back, and the software didn't help me, but MAYBE I CAN SAVE ONE OF YOU FROM WASTING YOUR HARD EARNED FUNDS WITH THIS COMPANY"". I'll never buy any software that they make again."
1,"Didn't work, no refund as promised, no way to contact company","I ordered the software. It didn't work. It required two computers and a 3.5 floppy to use (how antiquated). The company has a guaranteed refund offer. When I requested it, I heard nothing. After several requests, I got an email promising the refund in two weeks. That was in November, it is now mid-Jan and no contact with the company. This despite repeated requests. There is no way to contact the company other than email, which it ignores. Try something else and save your time and money."
1,I dunno,It's had to say if it works because the provided manual doesn't match the software and I'm stuck on what to do and how to use it. So only one star for lack of effort.
1,Excerpts from an inferior recording...Don't bother!,The performances were taped life in the theatre with no-name British cast. With so many GOOD (and more complete) recordings of OKLAHOMA! there is no need to waste time or money on this.
1,OLD fragrance,"I've purchased this fragrance from seller: Fragrance Alley.The smell is just as it should be,no problem wiyh the smell.BBut the color of the fragrance is DARK! Fragrances become dark when they get old. resoning froma bove stated, I've concluded that they've sold me an old fragrance (expiry date is not indicated on the box)..."
4,Growing a hero,"Clearly Stockwin attempts to follow C. S. Forester and Patrick O'Brian with another naval hero series; eleven novels are projected which should be ample scope to cover the Napoleonic Wars. Stockwin's ""Author's notes"" about pressed seamen who became officer heroes hint that he will eventually make Kydd an admiral.For that to happen, the callow wigmaker must grow mightily. And so may we expect his friend Renzi to do. And, perhaps, as the protagonists grow, so will the demonstration of literary skill by Stockwin. Let us hope so. Meantime I look forward to the next in the series."
5,An excellent book on a remarkable man.,"Tecumseh was a fascinating person and a figure in American history who has not been given enough attention. This book does an excellent job of portraying his political genius and inspiring human character. In addition, it provides an outstanding description of the complex period in which lived. George Kirschbaum."
5,Funk Don't Get No Better!!!,This is a very good concert and funk don't get no better. Some of the picture quality various from each artist. The sound is good but not great. If you're a real funk person than you will want this for your collection. Don't go to sleep because material for these artist is getting harder and harder to find. So get down on it and get with it.
2,"Review of Solar Galaxy of Stars Live (Shalamar, Dynasty, The Whispers","As much as I love these groups, I have to say that I am truly disappointed by the quality of this production. The video looks like someone took their cheap personal video camera and filmed the artists performances from the back row of the theatre. During the performances you can actually see people walking in front of the camera on their way back to their seats! The person recording the video was so far away from the stage that you can't even see the artists faces. Ocassionally there would be a closer shot of the artists from somewhere off the right-hand side of the stage, but those were the only two views used. Although I enjoyed the artists performances, the quality of this production was so poor that it actually made me dislike this DVD. I would not recommend this DVD to others."
3,solar galaxy of stars,ordered from america service exellent arrived well within time allocated.product a little dissapointing the whispers concert looked as though it was filmedby someone with a camera as people kept walking in front of the camera which i found alittle offputting but because i am a fan of the whispers the concert i thought was O.K.
2,Behind the scenes doc is good. Audio quality of the concert is sub-par,"The behind-the scenes documentary is great.However, the audio mix on the performance dvd is sub-par and is not acceptable for a commercial audio release."
1,my heroes have died,"The acoustic/blues version(s) of Basket of Eggs, Regulator, and now Tight Like That are terrible. They sound like Eric Clapton's ""Leyla"" or the horrible remake of ""Hotel California"" on the radio.I felt physically ill when they played them as a medley for their encore. Like my heroes had been killed,but worse, they killed themselves. I have loved Clutch for decades and given them a VERY wide lee-way as far as the wussy blues crap goes, but this is the final straw.It's bad enough that they make sucky whiney blues songs, but now they have actually tainted the memory of three AMAZING songs... it's like a double minus."
2,Jello On Legs,"Henry Silva and Diana Sands are the only reasons to watch this thinly-spread sandwich. This is one of those OL stories that would have been fine, if it had more time to develop during the writing phase, a better budget, and a better monster. But...it didn't.Actually, The Mice is great until the arrival of the gloppy alien. The first acts are well-written and interesting, suspenseful and a little unsettling. The story idea itself is wonderful. It just doesn't hold together over the space of the hour - any more than its far-too-much-seen Jello Monster. The entire last act is so padded with repeat viewings of the same stock footage chase sequence, and unnecessary and illogical fights and killings - not to mention a pretty crummy musical score - that you'll kill the time waiting for something pertinent to happen by seeking the zipper on the monster suit.Silva is wonderful, however, but then he always is. And Diana Sands is rather compelling."
5,Lightened up the gray sky of Seattle,I listen to it everyday! I think I am addicted to this album! The music makes entire family's life faster and happier.
5,"WONDERFUL, EASY TO READ, IMPACTFUL BOOK!","Don't be fooled by the HORRIBLE cover/ packaging. I don't even know what made me pick up this book, because it looks like an anger management book, but to say so, really does the book an injustice. Little daily meditations to give some much needed perspective in this world. GREAT spousal reading, or individual."
2,not for everyone,"This book is for parents who regularly yell at, threaten, berate, and lose their temper with their children, and are looking for calmer, more reasonable alternatives. Unfortunately, that was not me, so I did not find much useful info in here. It is not for parents who are looking for firmer and stronger discipline strategies to deal with children who are constantly challenging them.Also, it is quite a stretch to say this book is for preschoolers AND toddlers. It's really just for preschool age, unless your toddler is highly advanced verbaly."
5,Very entertaining book,"I read the book when a friend of mine recommended it to me. It is a short novel, but I enjoyed reading every page. The plot is gripping and the book has the potential to keep you absorbed for hours on end. To sum up, Ruby Garner-Part I is a very entertaining book and I am looking forward to it's next sequel."
2,Secure but not easy to use,"I bought this product to add extra security to my patio sliding door.I like the fact that it is adjustable up to 48"" - the width of my door. However, it turns out to be a little hard to use. The mechanism that lock is poorly designed. It is difficult to open the bar since the latch opening is too narrow and has little clearance. Another problem is that there is no fastener to keep the bar from swinging when it is in the open position causing rattle noises when opening the door. I would look for a better design in the future."
5,Totally Worth the Price,"My child LOVES these DVDs...fantastic price & great value for the package. They delivered it well before the estimated date, which was also a great plus. We are in search for more of this brand...well worth the $$."
5,Crisis Communication,"Judy Hoffman has been a great resource to our organization for developing our crisis communication plans as well as training our people throughout the US. This book is an easy read and a very helpful training tool to not only develop your plans, but also some nice do's and don'ts when the media shows up on your door step. If you manage a business you should be prepared for the various emergencies that could occur whether it be a plant fire or a ""postal"" employee."
4,brillaint and necessary,I wish I read this book sooner. Working in PR puts me in front of the media all too often and I wish that I had had this book when I first started. It could have saved me some grief. But I've read this book now and also Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR Wired so that I now know everything to make me a success.
4,getting ahead of the critics with honesty and integrity,"The author has presented a straight forward,plain talking approach to dealing effectively with potential negatives which are often exaggerated by the media and accentuated greatly in the absence of facts. While the author speaks from the standpoint of an industry that is often subject to hypercritical reviews,the information has validity and purpose in virtually any situation involving the necessity to communicate publicly concerning unpleasant,distasteful, or downright volatile circumstances. The management of the Exxons,Enrons,Arthur Andersens,etc and many of the Nation's public figures would be well served by abiding by the principles put forth in the book."
5,Best research paper guide ever!,"Putz' book on the multigenre research project has opened up a new world in my classroom! Kids are actually excited about doing research! The book, itself, goes step-by-step from the scheduling of such a project to explicit instructions for how to actually go from research to production and ends with a culminating reader's theatre for presentations. She writes with honesty, letting the reader know what worked for her and what didn't, plus has a CD with all of the handouts and sample projects to show students what they can create before you, as the teacher, have your own to show. If you're looking for a new way to get kids excited about the research process but are tired of the mundane 10 page paper, this is definitely a book you should not only look into, but utilize in your classroom!"
4,Real Assessment of Mastery,"I would give this 5 our of 5, but school won't start for another month so I haven't had the opportunity to put this wonderful concept into action. What I can say is that this gives the students the opportunity to shine, to demonstrate their mastery of skills, and to have fun. I plan to use this in my mythology class this year to test drive it before applying it to the rest of my schedule. What attracted me to this was the alternative way of testing students other than the bubble sheets that really only test how well students take a test."
4,This book is NOT about gay parents,"An earlier review made me think this book was about a little girl with male homosexual parents. I bought the book as a gift for a family with two homosexual fathers. I was disappointed to find that the book is NOT about a girl with homosexual parents. It is about a little girl whose parents have divorced and her mother is remarried: her ""two daddies"" are her biological father and her stepfather. The book explores Jennifer's attempts to maintain relationships with both ""fathers."" It is a nice (not amazing) treatment of this topic."
4,Following bthe bouncing ball!,"We bought this antenna ball to mount on the radio antenna of our MINI Cooper. It looks cute and makes it easy to locate our small MINI Cooper in a crowded parking lot. Hugs and kisses, see you real soon."
4,UFO's first classic release!,"This is the album that really made UFO a force to be reckon with, and it was the first one of the classic five studio albums that ended with ""Obsession"" in 1978. In the opening straight rocker ""Oh My"", Phil Mogg is singing ""Oh my, oh how the times have changed"", and the times sure did change for UFO as guitar wizard Michael Schenker joined the band. ""Phenomenon"" was released back in 1974, and the album features the well known and excellent ""Doctor, Doctor"" (maybe UFO's biggest hit ever) and the fan favourite ""Rock Bottom"", the album's hardest song which I personally don't fancy that much `cos of the quite boring chorus. Among the better tunes on this album are the beautiful semi ballad ""Crystal Light"" - a real highlight in UFO's long career - and the melodic and attractive ""Too Young To Know"". This is a classic rock album indeed, and if you want to be more familiar with hard rock from the 1970's in general this is a very good album to invest in."
4,Get This One If You Are New To UFO,"This is the one to get if you are starting to look at UFO's career. Obviously if you were a fan back in the day then you know that this is top shelf stuff so you probably don't need anyone to remind you of how influential this was at the time. People were talking about how killer Michael Schencker was which was true but I was equally as knocked out at how well they sounded as a band as opposed to some showy guitarist fronting a band. The songs worked and they rocked. Obviously the highlight of the record is ""Rock Bottom"" and for my money this is the only version I want to hear as I've never been thrilled with the endless noodling I've heard in various live versions. I realize other UFO fans might disagree but in any case you cannot go wrong with buying this record. I would suggest this above all other UFO studio albums (not that they are bad) because this is so good and captures the classic lineup so well."
5,Wrong Track Names,"The track labelled ""Oh My"" is really ""Too Young To Know"" and the track labelled ""Too Young To Know"" is really ""Oh My"".Great great album."
5,PHENOMENON (UFO),"This is the one album that really caught my attention when it first came out and discovered Michael Schenker who would eventually become my number 1 guitarist of all,there's really not enough space to tell the Schenker story this guy has influenced a lot of guitarists,I think he hasn't received the credit he deserves and probably never will,this is my sugestion in regards to (UFO/MSG)If you wanna have the best collection of a great guitar player I recomend UFO from( Phenomenon to Strangers in the night)and( The michael Schenker Group first to Tales of Rock & Roll)There's at least 30 MSG CD'S and also about 4 of UFO reunion with Schenker back, other then those recordings,my personal opinion I didn't care much for the other guitarists that came and went replacing Schenker except Vinnie Moore with UFO live only,If you never heard Michael Schenker before you will become a fan too once you hear his music!"
5,Great gift!,"Purchased these 3D glasses for my mother who collects snowmen. It's always a challenge to find something with a snowman that she doesn't already have. These glasses were a big hit. Very unique and fun. You have to be careful with them, they are made of paper...but not in a cheap way. Had fun with these at the holiday party. The more lights the better!"
4,Human Services Dictionary,This book is a great back up to help study. It's a great addition if you already have Rosenthal's Encyclopedia of Counseling. It makes the material so easy to understand.
2,fine til it broke in the breeze,Cheap umbrella for a cheap price - what do you expect? One of the ribs broke in a not so strong breeze. The ribs are made of thin cheap wood so there you go....
3,Solid Teak Wood Nine Foot Natural Patio Umbrella Market Umbrella - Natural,"Product was acceptable quality. I did not get the ""capital"" or top ornament with the item as was promised."
2,An imitation of other recordings.,"The vocals on this CD are very hard to hear over the music, and not well done when they're audible. The singers sound like they're trying to imitate the movie and original cast vocalists, and don't put any feeling into the songs. The songs sound flat and dull, with awkward pauses that were dramatic in other recordings. However, the boys' cast is quite good, and the songs they sing are the best on the CD."
4,Country-fied is the real deal.,An honest and witty take on life in the Dakotas. Babcock writes with the poise and eloquence that can only come from someone with a sincere appreciation and love for life in the Midwest. Readers will finding themselves nodding their heads as they relate to Babcock's essays from the very beginning. A truly enjoyable read.
3,"Violent, primitive, funny","For the genre, this book is terrific. It is talky, like most thrillers, and centers more on character drama and action than plot development. However, the mystery within is cryptic enough, and the characters real enough, that it is enjoyable, as is some of the comedic writing thrown in between the lines. It is unabashedly pulp but enjoyable, and I'd recommend it to anyone who can tolerate this genre."
3,Didn't hold the kids interest.,"Simple, basic game but the kids don't play with it much. Maybe it is meant for younger children (I bought it for my 8-year old)."
4,It works,"There's no question that after about 3 weeks on this diet, plus daily doses of Coenzyme Q-10, my blood pressure has dropped significantly ... about 15 points systolic and nearly the same diastolic. The book could come more directly to the point that the idea here is to increase your potassium intake and reduce your sodium intake and maintain a rather high ratio of potassium to sodium. The numbers are all in the book. A caution ... the low calorie version of the diet has not resulted in much weight loss. That part has been disappointing, but they do point out that this diet is primarily for blood pressure issues and that weight loss is secondary. It's worth reading."
4,Great starting place,"I am 24 years old and just found out I have high blood pressure. I didn't know what to do as I am a generally fit guy, so figured it must be the way I ate (like crap) and wanted to change it. This was a great way to get things started and aided me in hopefully getting on the right track. The first few sections are very hard to read through, as it seems to be selling a product although you've already bought the book. I skimmed the first sections after reading a few pages of that, and then got to the 2 week meal plan and the portion sizes for each day and have since made my own Excel Spreadsheet to keep track of what I am eating during the different meals. I do like how the different food items in the book include what food groups are included to assist with keeping track.Only real con is the layout and the way it is written to convince you the diet works... let me just try it."
2,Not a good diet for diabetics!,The Dash Diet for Hypertension: Lower Your Blood Pressure in 14 Days--Without Drugsis a good book to learn about Hypertension but as far as the diet is concerned it is far too high in refined carbohydrates and not enough protein. Their diet would be very difficult and or dangerous for a diabetic. The diabetic would have to take much more insulin than necessary to follow the diet. And to lower the blood pressure 6 points is nothing in the total picture. So I would not recommend this book. I have a degree in nutrition and work with diabetics (my husband for one) all the time.
2,one month no book,"this was not a good experience for me, really needed this book for the first of the year. they do not know where the book is, possibly lost in mail. mean while you wait, till last possible date their schedule for deliverey, to get return of money. was not something they argured about just wasted way too much time,"
3,Disappointed with this book,I purchased this book for some recipes basically which the book does contain BUT...not one photograph of the actual food. What is a recipe book without a picture?? To me.....not much! My newspaper includes a little dash recipe guide once or twice a month. That little 2-3 page guide is better than this book. At least it's full of pictures & recipes!
3,same old stuff,"Same old diet recommended by US Gov. No need to buy the book, just eat healthy like the gov food pyramid and weight watchers recommends."
1,"DON""T GET THE KINDLE VERSION","DO NOT GET THE KINDLE VERSION. THE BOOK ADVERTISED IS THE NEW 2011 VERSION, BUT IF YOU ORDER THE KINDLE VERSION THEY SEND TO YOU THE OLD, OUTDATED 2001 VERSION.IF YOU WANT THE BOOK MAKE SURE ITS THE JUNE 2011 EDITION!!!![ASIN:145166558X The DASH Diet for Hypertension]"
4,Very easy diet!,This diet is very easy and I have already lost 8 pounds after only 3 weeks. My blood pressure is also dropping. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that they do not offer any substitutions for foods that I do not like.
1,Nothing you can't learn for free,"The DASH diet is well documented online. Ordinarily I would say that the price of the book is justified by having the information brought together and organized, but this book fails so very badly at that job. The information is in fact poorly organized, surprisingly so. The book is in every sense unappealing, with bad typography, irritating language and a feeling of having been thrown together with no thought or effort. As for the diet itself, it works wonderfully and can play a big part in your fight against hypertension. But this book is a terrible place to learn about it."
2,The DASH Diet for Hypertension,"This book has some interesting, informative and useful information. However, many pages part of the type has been omitted. It's usually one or two characters per line. Usually you are able to figure out what the word(s) is supposed to be but this makes reading and using the book difficult. Needless to say, it's not a book that you look forward to using."
2,a complicated diet/book,I read online about the dash diet and thought I would check it out. The meal planning is rather complicated (and not explained very well in the book). I didn't find anything in the book I couldn't have found online.
3,A better than average romance with some very good moments.,"This_Golden_Valley is the first book Francine Rivers wrote that hinted at the talent she would show in later works.The heroine is lively and attractive, and the hero is appropriately intriguing.The writing style is easy to read with none of the hyperbole and exaggeration that is typical of the genre.However, if you get this one, prepare yourself for a disappointing ending.(Can you say ""Deus Ex Machina"")Just the same, the disappointment of the destination is allayed by the enjoyment of the scenery along the way."
4,Some good material on this CD,"While this is not a completely satisfying CD, it does have some good moments. Bertice Reading, who comes across as a senior citizen, does a fine job with ""Someone to Watch Over Me."" Salena Jones does a great job with ""A Quiet Thing."" And Lorna Dallas could sell you the house as she sings ""The Folks Who Live on the Hill."" Another interesting track is Barry Bostwick's ""Look Who's Alone Now"" from the short-lived Broadway musical, ""Nick and Nora."""
3,"Decent, straightforward covers","This very budget-friendly tribute disc was recorded by the ""Stars of Studio 99"". I do not know who exactly make up this group of musicians, but in other tribute releases by them, they are referred to as ""professional session artists who've worked with some of the biggest names in music"" (or something along those lines).The music itself is very safe covers. No chances taken here. Instrumentation is pretty much note-for-note cover....my only gripes is the vocals. What do you expect? It's not Freddie Mercury.Very good tracklisting, too.All in all, considering the price...you cannot go wrong."
3,Great for showing the relative size compared to the Saturn V,"I bought this model to show at talks I give on space and astronomy and in particular because it was the same scale as the Saturn V I purchased earlier. The model is made of wood and so does not have a lot of very fine detail, however the boosters do have some sort of ribbing attached to show where each section was joined. The finish on the boosters is not quite perfect as there appears to be some small holes in the surface of the timber underneath the painted finish. Overall though I think it would make a great display on the desk at work or in a case at home and recommend buying one."
2,VERY LITTLE mythical creatures stained glass coloring book,"I was quite disappointed in the LITTLE size of the book it only measures4-3/8 x 5-1/2. The wording in the auction made me think that the book would be coloring book size with little mythical creatures, with coloring book style pictures, out lined pictures with no fine detail. I thought it would be good for STAINED GLASS. The pictures are so small, 3-3/8 X 4-7/8, that they will all have to be enlarged to be able to be used for stained glass, even for sun catchers.I would think a ruler or a coin in the photo or some other size reference would have yielded 5 stars. I left a 2 star rating because the books are new and have clear coloring book style pictures. I think for the size of the book, the auction is over priced. No where in the auction does it mention the tiny size of the book."
2,Poor Quality - PILLING!,"I was very pleased with the color and texture of the sheets. However, they have shown to be of poor quality. After six months of using them 50% of the time (I rotate them every 2 weeks with another pair), they are pilling. Probably 75% of the sheets are covered in those little balls and it is quite uncomfortable. I am disappointed, I assumed with the price they should last longer than a few months. Also, we are an adult/clean home with no pets in the bedroom, so there is no reason this should be happening. I purchase new sheets yearly and have never had this happen before.I am contacting the seller today, I will post an update if I get a response."
2,BY-pass this one,"Exploding on the music scene via the British dance act D-mob, Cathy Dennis quickly established herself as a force to be reckoned with. Clocking up 5 US top 40 hits in 2 years Cathy was one of the most exciting dance pop acts around. After a flop second album she returned with the pop/rock effort ""am i the kind of girl?"" THis greatest hits package does attempt to cover all her work but fails in that it lacks TWO major hits ""cmon get your love"" which was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic as well as ""thats the way of the world"". Best to get her debut album ""move to this."""
5,Great thrower for any shooter.,"This is a pretty good thrower...doesn't match those professional throwers but for the price and size, you can't go wrong. I shoot around 10 cases a season with this thrower and it just works. No problems so far. The only addition that would be great is if they sold a kit that can covert it to a foot release so that I can shoot by myself. But this thrower throws far and fast."
5,trap thrower,"Good quality thrower,durable and well built for the money. Would recommend a wobbler kit for added funFew broken clays but this could have been caused by box handling, after all they are clay targets"
5,Buy All His Books,"These books will one day be recorded as history told before its time. While the mainstream shurgs him now, he will be required reading years to come."
1,Going back to dark ages,"I gave it 1 star only because I could not leave it blank!Before I started reading this book, I knew that Buchanan stands for racism and discrimination of common freedoms, but to send us all to the DARK AGES - that is not simply immoral and obscure, but a total nonsense that can be explained only by a deliriously sick mind.The problems that he raises are just causes to get to his real goals: take away freedoms from women, divide people, take away people rights, rise Church above all other states even if it requires another inquisition, implement racism.Before I read this book, I was not a feminist, I did not support gay and lesbian movements, and I did not particularly like people from Third Worlds entering US at a rate they are. After reading this book, I understood why there is so much opposition in the US. I also now know that main problem of the US today is people like Buchanan, ignorant, immoral, self-sufficient, deteriorating, anti-progressive, and ruthless."
1,more political hypocrisy and gaul.,"He sees declining birth rates as a danger? ""Uncontrolled immigration""? As it correctly states in Amazons review, you will either applaud or be repulsed, well I'm sure not applauding this drivel. ... Pat is worried about a lot of political bs that is nothing more than diluted, watered down, politics as usual, whose major function is to do nothing, mostly because they CAN'T do anything. Read Howard Zinn, ""A Peoples History of the United States; 1492 to present"", and you will be pretty much brought up to speed on the ""Lies My Teacher told Me"", ahh, another good title to try to find. Read and weep, if you have compassion, the truth about ""The Trail of Tears"" or ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"". Be forewarned, sometimes the painful truth will make you shed a heartfelt tear, but you really should know it anyway, so you can make better decisions regarding yourself and your loved ones. ""Since there ain't no zeroes, I give you a 1""! Via Con Dios."
2,Consistent Buchanan Blather...jt,"Pat Buchanan is consistent. He exploits sore spots like a compulsive scab picker but offers analysis stuck in his Irish-Catholic-school-yard-bully past, with very limited understanding of cause or cure for the USA's malaise.Here Buchanan rails against the birth control pill while being blind to the fact that his Pope went into the heartlands of poverty and preached against birth control, thus cheerleading a population tidal wave which spills over our borders. Poor people invade America to escape poverty that comes from overpopulation --- the predictable consequence of irresponsible parenting.I gave this book two stars because Pat writes very well; he's just a mediocre thinker, a third rate historian and an impotent social critic. Once one understands that Pat Buchanan can be very entertaining."
1,Buchannan is a Racist and a Bigot!,"Does he think America was spontaneously populated by God with white Europeans? White Europeans killed and exterminated the native populations of North America to set up their own power structure. From where does he think he came? EVERYONE in America, save Native Americans, are descendents of immigrants. It is extremely hypocritical of him to benefit from immigration and then shut it down to prevent others the same opportunity that his relatives were provided. What is the most infuriating is his blatant and open prejudice, bigotry, and racism. What intellingent person living in the 21st century can claim to ascertain the worth of a human being by his or her skin color or cultural background. Buchanan should be publicly exposed for what he is: a racist, a bigot, and a hypocrite. If he really wants to come clean he should start wearing the pointy white hat in public..."
1,"Terrible, ignorant, and factually incorrect.","I am not a liberal. I gave 5-stars to Dinesh D'Souza's 'What's so great about America', which is a far more intelligently written book.The problem is, this book caters to white racists who believe that unless something is white and Christian, it is not civilized.I bet Pat Buchanan thinks Dinesh D'Souza is beneath him, simply because he is not white. Buchanan is also incorrect that California will become a third-world country because of the inflow of Mexicans AND ASIANS. He overlooks the fact that Asians have a higher education level and per capita income than Whites."
1,"Is there no choice for ""0 stars""?","I was outraged by this book. And then I realised I was still reading the introduction. This man is racist, sexist, anti-semitic, and downright looney. He makes claims he can't support, and tries to back his opinions with pure conjecture. The subtext of this book suggests that the White Man is a superior being, and must do whatever it takes to keep both women and other races in their place. While reaffirming family values sounds like a good idea, Mr. Buchanan's ridiculous approach to the problem destroys any credibility he may have had to begin with."
5,For open minded,"It is a well researched good read. I decided to read it after critics said it was ""racist!....native americans were here first!"". CBS's 60 MINUTES several years ago reported the discovery of the oldest human skull in America. It was of a white person, but didn't receive a lot of attention because it wasn't ""politically correct"". This book will continue to be savaged by the elite establishment. When they don't have facts on their side, they turn to demagoguery, slander, and character asassination."
1,loosely put together though seemingly well thought out,"Buchanan points out issues, nationally and internationally, that impact the rest of America. But the perspective that he's coming from is politically short-sighted not because he's racist but because his refusal to understand complex issues. To understand American issues on a multi-faceted front requires a sensible response, or at least a well-thought out response. Buchanan refuses to think. Rather, he jumps to a defensive that weakly defines what America is supposed to be. Buchanan's attack on pluralism and American ideals, while at the same time, advocates a stance that is neither Republican nor Democrat. He undermines the need that American politics must foster in this great country of ours. Buchanan's radicalism does nothing to challenge the real deep-seated issues in this country. It just supports the xenophobia that Americans have inherited and been crippled from. I encourage everyone to see ""The Fog of War"", by Errol Morris."
4,Very Right Wing,"This book is extreme, but it definitely hits the nail on the head on alot of its points. I always viewed Mr. Buchanan as a bit of a right-wing crackpot, but I admire his courage for telling things like it is. Very worth the read, even if you don't agree with him. This book definitely makes you fear for the future of this country."
2,Chicken Little!,"There have always been people who decry current trends, which they see as bringing on disaster. This would include attitudes towards the Irish coming to America in the 19th century, eastern Europeans in the early 20th century, the end of effective medical care in the US when Medicare was developed 40 years ago, the end of movies in the 1950s, and so on. In spite of all the protestations, America is still the guiding light of the world, offering its people a better life and more opportunity than anywhere else on earth, and life only gets better in spite of the efforts of some to move it in another direction. Read Gregg Easterbrooks THE PROGRESS PARADOX for a more realistic look at America and the direction in which we are going."
2,why we study history,"The book is remarkably well written. I read the book with the expectation of disagreeing with what the author was saying, but found him surprisingly convincing. However, I did notice several flaws in the authors logic. First he is of the impression that we study history to develope a sense of nationalism and instill pride in Americans. I however have always been of the impression that we study history so we don't repeat the same mistakes our anscestors did. Maybe both who know, but he seems to think we should whitewash American history. A point I disagree with him on. Secondly he portrays immigrants, Mexicans in particular, as hateful to Americans and full of their own national pride without pointing out that this part is only a small proportion of the ones that immigrate to America."
5,TRULY FABULOUS,BUCHANAN HAS THE GUTS TO SPELL IT ALL OUT WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT OR NOT. A REALLY GREAT BOOK!!!
1,Looking backwards,Patrick Buchanan is so far out of touch. Thank God he never makes it past the primary. This guy is a dinosour as are most his his followers who are wishing for a past that no longer exists and never exist again. Those were repressive times. I can understand that every generation thinks their generation was the best... Time for Pat and his zelots to move forward with the present and let go of a past that nobody desires today.
1,Tradegy after Tragedy,If 9/11 wasn't enough...this book is even worse. R.A.C.I.S.M. Let me be the one to spell it out to you. This book deals with junky ideas about non-equality. If this is America...then we are al equally righted to be here.
1,miss guided,in one of the reviews that was posted the author did not do is homework or else he would have found out the the dung is elephant dung and where the artist comes from is considered a holy substance so i think that the whole issue is a case of cultural miss understanding.as they say one man's poison is anothers man food.i rated this book a one because i have not read it yet.
1,If This Is What Anyone One Believes In: I'm NOT With Them,"This book is utterly ridiculous. Just reading the first few pages drove me to insanity because I straight away knew his view point was racist and that's all it has to do with. Pat is just tryig to turn everyone racist by pointing out minor problems in American society. What Pat Buchanan and his cohorts don't understand is that WE AS IN ALL OF US, ARE ALL AMERICANS. This is America as we know it today. It's time to put behind racial and secular divide. That's what has made America the greatest country in the world especially in the last 20 years. Pat and his cohorts will just have to get along and extradite their traditionalist values."
1,"how long did it take to write this book? 2, 3 hours?","I borrowed this book from the library because I didn't want to buy it. Good idea. Actually, bad idea, don't even bother."
1,The sky is falling! The sky is falling!,"One has to wonder why Pat Buchanan is always so scared. I have to think he intentionally chose 50 years as the time span for the fall of western civilization because he knows he won't be around any longer and therefore won't have to face the fact that he's dead wrong... again. The conclusions in this book are so far-fetched, so alarmist, and so downright ridiculous that they are far to numerous to address here. The book can be summed up like this: If you are an extremely conservative (socially, religiously, and politically) white Christian who thinks the world is falling apart and that the End of Days is near, you'll undoubtedly agree with everything Buchanan has to say. Everyone else will recognize this book for the utter nonsense that it is and therefore need not bother themselves with reading it."
2,Thought-provoking but unconvincing,"Although thought-provoking and well-researched, Buchanan's central argument - that western civilization is on the verge of extinction - is ultimately unconvincing. Declining birth rates and immigration trends certainly will carry social impacts, however, no one can convincingly predict what those specific implications will be. Even less convincing are his solutions. If indeed western civilization is on the brink, then increasing tax deductions for children, passing laws against legal immigration and conducing a national history bee are highly simplistic reactions to complex realities. The only original and convincing idea in this book is that the world is a changing place."
5,"The Death of the West, Buchanan's latest.","Mr. Buchanan has dodged or met up with a lot of political bullets because of his well researched writing on what has happened, is happening, or what he feels is going to happen in the world. In ""Death of the West"" Buchanan writes of what he believes our world is going to be like in another 50 years due to the decline in European populations and the effects of other important factors. He predicts that our great America will be reduced to a Third World nation status, citing de-Christianization, political correctness, and exploding non-European populations as only a few of the causes. I like this book enough to give it a prominent place on my bookshelf. I like this book because Buchanan is not a dainty writer; he hit me hard with his brute force, honesty, and integrity. My great-grandchildren will live long enough (I hope)to judge whether, in 2050, he was on or off target."
1,Don't forget where you came from,"What does mass immigration has to do with preserving western culture? Just because other ethic groups are growing larger relatively doesn't mean that the western culture can't be preserved. It seems like a convenient excuse rather than a logical reason. Let's not foget most American families were immigrants. From Mr. Buchanan argument, one can derive that the original european immigrant had driven the native american culture to death.Let's face the reality. America has never been a ""one culture"" country. A wise man would embrace the differences among us and not promoting ""one-supreme-culture-fit-all"" ideology. America has a very unique diversified culture. It's better to spend the energy making it better rather than reversing it."
1,There should be an option of ZERO stars,"Ohmygoodness, Pat is at it again! In case you thought that a new book would mean new ideas, be assured that this book too can be summed up with one sentence: Gotta keep those scruffy non-whites out! Yes! Only Christian white folks need apply to move to the pure-as-snow USA.Really folks, if you cannot get enough of Pat, save your money and just re-read one of his previous books."
1,Pat's declining birthrate,"So the culprit in pat's worldview is the declining birthrate in the west, coupled with the exploding birthrate in the 3rd world. Interesting premise, from a man that has exactly zero offspring himself."
1,Are you sure you read the book?,"Mr. Buchanan isn't against immigrants or immigrationAs long as the immigrants are White Christian Europeans.Being Native American I understand very well the Europeans immigrated over here. He isn't lying but he is giving half truths.He wants it to be like the 50'sNO civil rights for NON-WhitesSorry Pat, I like to vote (often) and I'm sure he loves to see Black people contributing to the work force, as long as they're back in the kitchen washing dishes.Cold War Paranoia or in our case in 2002 will be terrorist paranoia, maybe if he were in the white house he would distribute tapes showing us how to protect ourselves from Anthraxby ducking under the desk or covering our mouths with goverment Kleenex or other usless nonsense!The book is poorly written and researched, don't buy it...get a Chia pet"
1,The Book Is Ridiculous,American's have truly forgotten where they come from and to see a 4-star rating for this book is a peril in itself to America. This book is highly indecent and makes no sense at all. Buchanan himself is not married and has no children. He himself doesn't practice at all what he preaches. I believe Pat and the rest of these racist people are just jealous of those with different skin color. America would have NEVER EVER become what it is today without immigration from all the different countries through out the world. AND YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT.
2,It only make sence from the author's point of view.,I was expecting some new arguments on all this immigrant issue but the author only repeat the same point I have herd all the way through the 90s and if you are not familiar with this issue it could be useful (at least to know his point of view and stuff he heard about it) but otherwise it is a waste of time.
5,"Changing not Killing, Read SB 1 or God","I do agree with the backbone of this write, however the undertones of the author lack depth of real understanding. I do not hear any prejudging undertones of white America being lost, but the clues are that other immigrating races are destroying what was thought to be original American White culture. There is only partial truth to that, in that America's culture is being changed by a mixing process. Other immigrating races bring and HAVE their culture here in groups, and Homegrowns retain their culture in groups. Inbetween all that there is a little mixing which changes those who interact. Patricia is good, she has expressed her feelings adamantely but she needs to do a little more world travel and research. For that I need to strongly recommend reading a book that brings this all together very well, SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox."
1,Fantastic Tripe,"When Pat talks about the West, he is referring to Europe, America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Wait a minute? Aren't some of these countries pretty far from Europe? What are white people doing there? Well, you see, hundreds of years ago European nations INVADED these countries and DROVE OFF, KILLED or SUBJUGATED their peoples and claimed the land their own. Want to talk about a dying people? Look at the condition of your average Native American or Native Australian Aborigine family. And Pat has the nerve to talk about the ""dying"" WASP American or how European culture is supposedly in danger of extinction.Not only are his claims exaggerated, Buchanan misses the main point at hand: this immigration explosion in western nations is a backlash and a result of European colonialist expansion. Think about it for a sec.By the way, I'm a white European."
1,"The word is ""hypocrite""","I'll offer two things on this book:1) This is America, thank God, and Buchanan absolutely has the right to his opinion and the right to publish it. Don't criticize him for that. He does not, however, have the right to publish his opinion and forbid others from offering their own. So feel free to lambast him for being a huge bigot, which he certainly is.2) How interesting that Buchanan sees declining birthrates as such a peril for the white, hetero, christian, uber-conservative way of life he so cherishes. Buchanan himself has no children. There's a word for that...."
1,Shame...,"I feel ashamed and disgusted by this book... Some of my best friends are american and they certainly do not endorse Buchanan's fascism. It is a shame that the true democratic nation I learnt of many years ago, has been able to produce this kind of fanaticism and misguided arguments... A complete waste of your time... you better buy something else, read Henry James, William Faulkner, Herman Melville, but do not waste your time and your money on this clown."
1,The Numbers Are Wrong:,"Mr. Buchanan should have looked up some demographic numbers, and trends.The West is not unique, it's just a little ahead of the curve. Take a look at some TFR's -- Total Fertility Rates (numbers of children born in a woman's lifetime. Note that 2.1 is replacement level:Iran: 2.01 (Twenty years ago, over 5)Turkey: 2.12 (Twenty years ago, over 5)Tunisa: 1.99 (Twenty years ago, over 6)Indonesia: 2.58 (Twenty years ago, over 6)Most Islamic countries, particularly the bigger ones, are well into the ""demographic transition"" to lower birth rates. Even ones which still have high birth rates have started on it -- eg., in Pakistan the percentage of married women who use contraceptives has gone from less that 4% in 1989 to more than 35% in 2001.The whole world, not just the West, is headed towards stable or declining populations. We just pioneered it.Mr. Buchanan should find something more credible to worry about."
5,Telling the WHOLE truth,"This is a great book but it still aint the whole story. After yuove done here you gotta read Eric Schlosser ""Fast Food Nation"" and find out why we got so many immigrants - and worst still so many ILEGAL immigrants coming in all the time.Its about time they was telling us the WHOLE truth."
5,Obituary of a Civilization,"Pat Buchanan has startled and amazed me with this book! I have heard of and was aware of the ""birth derth"" in the western democracies having heard and read oblique references to it in the media. However, in just the opening pages of his book, Buchanan has raised my concern for this phenomenon to the highest level.If you only read the first 20 pages or so of this book, your money will have been well spent! In the most cogent of openings, Buchanan succeeds in proving the point that the west is facing its most significant threat from within its own culture, and that the failure of the west to reproduce its population will inevitably lead to its decline and death as a civilization.Buchanan will certainly not get his due in his life time, but any remnant of western civilization that manages to survive this century will certainly recognize him as one of this centuries most important thinkers, and one that should have been heeded, but of course it will then be too late!"
1,Blechhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Not worth the paper it's written on, or the gas to go to the library to pick up a copy (since I wouldn't own one)."
1,a conservative perspective on contemporary issues,"Although Buchanan confronts topics such as immigration, he does not fully explain the why's and how's of such conditions. Buchanan has not explored the background of topics such as immigration, etc. Buchanan refuses to write about countless minorities and ethnic groups that have made the United States a better place. Because Buchanan chooses to focus on a negative perspective about issues like immigration, his motive for writing this book comes into question. In a time where America needs to unite in times of crisis, Buchanan does not remedy nor answer questions regarding social problems within America itself. Buchanan misses the point that diversity is what makes our country so versatile. What Buchanan does is create an anxiety for the average American when writing this book. What Buchanan needs to write about is the resilience in a diverse America."
1,Twisted idealogy,"On the one hand, Buchanan blames modern contraception for the West's fading (white) population. On the other, he takes no responsibility--nor assigns any to church leaders--for his own religion's anti-contraceptive dogma, which has encouraged the huge, impoverished population increases in the very immigrant groups Buchanan now wants to get rid of. Can't have it both ways, Pat. What? The West should breed millions of unwanted children, just to catch up?"
1,Don't waste your time or money reading this,"A collection of the railings and rantings of a dejected old man who obviously cannot accept reality and deal with it. Thankfully it is clear from his electoral successes (rather the lack of them) that his views do not have popular support. It is too bad that the (TV and Radio) media gave him all the free airtime for popularising this book (and putting it on the NY times bestseller list)A couple of observations are apt here. I wonder what Mr. Buchanan thinks about the native Americans who were displaced and butchered by the european immigrants a few centuries ago. I guess they reacted the same way to the exposure to new peoples and cultures. According to him, the Hispanics should be dissuaded from celebrating their heritage, for example, ""Cinco de Mayo"". Going by that argument, St. Patrick's day should be outlawed."
4,Some Thing for Everyone,"Mr. Buchanan is an excellent writer, and he has done his homework. There is plenty that is controversial, but he is clearly a man of conviction that has given liberal and conservative plenty to think and argue about. If you can read this book with an open mind, you will get something out of it;if you cannot, it is likely that you are part of the problem."
4,Some Rarely Heard Truths,"Pat Buchanan, as always, gives us something to think about. In this book, he did a fine job of identifying a serious problem, and explaining how it came about, and why we should all be concerned about it.I enjoyed the fact that Pat was not afraid to challenge politically correct myths, but instead identify the fact that mass immigration, unchecked and unchallenged, is a serious problem that anyone interested in the sovereignty of the US should be concerned about. Pat laid out a very strong case. A very well-written book."
1,Buchanan is a major hypocrit,"Let's see--Buchanan preaches American values and American self-sufficiency, yet during his last campaign for President he was fingered for driving a German import while hawking isolationist idealogy to American auto workers. Next, Buchanan preaches against birth control yet has no children, himself. If he and the Missus were medically unable to produce a pro-American flock of kids themselves, shouldn't they at least have adopted a dozen or so children to do their duty? Pat Buchanan--""Do as I say, not as I do."""
1,Give the Irish back to Ireland,"Surprisingly to me, I agree with Mr Buchanan that third-world immigrants have been a detriment to this nation; unfortunately for Pat's sake, most of them came from the (until recently) third-world nation of Ireland. Also unfortunately (considering Pat's preference for white babies), he seems unable to do what the Irish are so famous for: that is, breed indiscriminately. (I have the sinking feeling that he and his wife have never consummated their marriage.) So, let's load Pat and his fellow members of the Irish Catholic beltway mafia (Bill O'Reilly, Chris Matthews, Maureen Dowd, Michael Kelly, Peggy Noonan, Tim Russert) onto a sailing ship with plenty of potatoes and whiskey, and send them and their un-American papist traditions back to the ""Emerald Isle"" ASAP. ;)"
1,Weird book,"This is a strange book. I'm afraid I don't really understand his problem. It's always seemed to me America is a place for people to come to, I mean the Pilgrims were technically immigrants right? This is laden with Buchanan's strong opinions, if you like that sort of thing, I didn't."
1,Nativism,"Nativism has historically waxed and waned throughout US history. This is just another example of such. As Americans railed against Irish Catholics in the 1840s, Buchanan rails against non-whites in the 21st century. And the wheel goes around and around.Cheers"
1,Buchanon Is loosing It,This is the most racist diatribe I have read recently. Buchanon was once a brilliant thinker and writer but seems to be loosing his cognitive powers in place of actual inelegance he has inserted reactionary racism. it is unfortunate that this book does not better argue his case. In the end this book is more sad and pathetic than outrageous. This is the most racist diatribe I have read recently.
1,A horidily racist book that renews a call to culture war,"The book ""The Death of the West: How Dying Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Country and Civilization"" is a disgrace and a shameful waste of good paper for such racist and discriminatory beliefs. This book blasts women, Asians and immigrants in general. However, Western women are the ones most strongly depicted and labeled as bad compared to the American and European rases. Your delusional, selective, racist and xenophobic views are a descries not only to this great country, which holds its strength in its diversity, but also to the company which agreed to publish this book."
1,"A waste of time, unfortunately","This book could have been interesting. There are some points to be made about changes in western civilization which should be examined. Unfortunately, Buchanan's book is nothing but a silly rant against all the groups he enjoys dehumanizing. Every other sentence seems to be a ridiculous attack on gay people, which I foud nauseating. Buchanan is oddly obsessed with gay people, as if we are some kind of demons trying to destroy the world. It is a total waste of time, and a sad commentary on the state of scholarship in this country."
1,Lost in Translation - NOT!,"I didn't think much of this screed, but perhaps it was better in the original German."
4,Worth A Look See,"While I have usually equated right-wingism with extremism in the past, after reading this book, I felt that Mr. Buchanan has made some very compelling arguments for the future disintigration of The United States. His views in this book are far from right-wing, (a label long ascribed to the author) but very mainstream and timely considering recent events in our land. Some real food for thought!"
5,Wonderful and Thought Provoking,"This is a fantastic book, well written, with wonderful characters and a slowly unfolding story that challenges you to determine the truth. Maggie, the main character, is a flawed, big hearted, loyal woman whom I loved from the beginning. She is pushed to confront doubts about Father Jack, her employer and friend of 18 years, and the man she credits with saving her life, as he is charged with child sexual abuse and murder. The gathering speed of the runnaway train of public opinion that turns the reputation of a priest against his own interests is facinating. This book is never pat or easy, but very engaging."
1,Keep Looking,"This book is extremely long on what, but strangely short on how. So if your aim is to learn about ISO 9001:2000, by all means, this is the book for you. But if you're interested in implementation, keep looking."
5,Timeless Listening Pleasure,"Kate St.John's voice has an innocence that makes me have those warm and fuzzy feelings. The use of piano and stringed instruments give it a soothing life, yet there are other instruments used. One of which, sounds like a lap steel guitar. I thoroughly enjoy the French tracks. All in all, her music will not disappoint you!"
5,My little one loves it,"Okay, *I* may think it's boring and *you* may think it's boring, but my child ... loves this little book. It is frequently the one he chooses to have read to him, perhaps because each page is interactive.One, of course, must pat the cat. Then you can extract money from the ATM and later put it into daddy's wallet. You can imitate mommy making a list, scratch and sniff the gingersnaps, help Neddy and Martha see-saw and play peek-a-boo, and squeeze the little bear before going to bed.It is a fun, quiet little book that your child will enjoy. And you will too -- not because it's exciting, but because the time you and your child spend looking through it will be happy and peaceful."
2,Not as good as the original,"My 12 month old daughter loved ""Pat the Bunny"" so I was excited to get this book for her, but it's not as good as the original. There is too much text in this one... it doesn't hold her interest as much and the activites inside the book are more difficult and not as toddler-friendly. She started destroying the book's activities in a day or two. Maybe for older kids it's better, but whereas the original book was fine for her level, this was a disappointment."
2,Pat the Cat,"My daughter loved the book Pat the Bunny but after a few months it came apart.... I decided to look for another one like it and came across Pat the Bunny. I was excited to get it for her. Sadly she had it ripped up within the first few minutes. She was bored with the long drawn out reading, I had to make up my own short version for her. Now, even though it is missing the money, the pencil, and the kids playing seesaw she likes me to read it to her in my own version. Not for younger children apparently I would get it for a child older than 2"
3,Not as good as Pat the Bunny,My daughter is in love with Pat the Bunny so I purchased this book. She is 6 months old and is already more into books than toys. This book however is not as good as Pat the Bunny. She still enjoys it but mostly for the pee-a-boo part where they hide under the table. She is just to young for some of this book so it didn't work well for us. Pat the Bunny is more touch and feel while as this you take pieces and use a pencil to write on paper. She wanted to eat the pencil vs pretend to write with it. She may grow into this book but I recommend Pat the Bunny to anyone her age or younger.
2,Buyer Beware,"This book unfortunately became useless pretty quickly. There is a scene where Daddy takes money from the ATM and puts it in his wallet- the slots in the book are prone to rip quickly (as in, as soon as we used it) and the money is a loose piece of cardstock that will not hold up and will wander away from the book. Your child will also pretend to write a shopping list with a card stock pencil on a string. The design is frustrating and prone to the string getting tangled between pages and ripping the book. Over all, the design is impractical and not durable. My kids love Pat the Bunny and cats and are truly not very destructive as far as books go. Secondly, the story line of Ned, Martha and Columbus the cat does not roll off one's tongue quite as well as the original did."
5,My two year old LOVES it!,"My 2 year old daughter LOVES this book, she can't get enough! The manipulatives inside make her feel very confident, she likes to do exactly as the book says and feels very pleased with herself. Warning: You will be reading this more than once at a time=) I highly recommend it."
1,Not good for young readers,"My wife and I hate this book and just threw it away. First, if you're familiar with Pat the Bunny, this is the continuation if that ""franchise"" from the originator's daughter. It's very cheesy and ""modern,"" with activities like ""help daddy go the ATM machine and take out money."" The big problem is that, unlike the original, there are removable parts of the book, and these will get gnawed to oblivion by the average child in the age range intended. Not sure why they didn't see that was going to be a problem. That said my 1-year-old daughter really liked this book, but Pat the Bunny is far superior."
2,The Wizard of OZ??,"This is a very well-done recording but it doesn't come close to matching the magic of Judy Garland, Ray Bloger, Bert Lahr, or Jack Haley. For me this isn't the ""real"" Wizard of Oz. Please buy the cd with the classic voices instead of this remake!"
1,WARNING! The title of this CD is BERBERISM.,"Amazon incorrectly lists the title of this CD as ""South Moroccan Motor Berber"" when it is actually Argan's first album ""Berberism."" Don't make the same mistake I did."
5,Great overview for new I-DEAS users,"My company has used this book for years as it has progressed through several editions. All of our new employees and student interns go through the entire book for their initial training on the I-DEAS software. It is well organized and well written. It does not make you an ""expert"" in any of the modules, but rather focuses on providing a broad overview of the many capabilities of the comprehensive I-DEAS software package. The hands-on workshops are more interesting and effective due to the use of an example mechanical system which evolves through the entire book, from part design to system assembly, mechanism analysis, finite element analysis, and even manufacturing.This edition applies specifically to I-DEAS 8 and earlier. However, we have used it effectively with the newly released I-DEAS 9."
1,Worst President of all time,"Self serving, horibly bland and pointless; obviously written to trick people into voting for him. Too bad it worked."
4,Insightful Look into a Future President,"Bush's 2000 campaign book proves to be an insightful look into a man who wears many hats: oil mogul; sports team owner; son of a prominent politician; and born again Christian. He explains his journey and most of his philosophies for his positions enunciated during his campaign for the presidency in 1999 and 2000. His religious beliefs are manifest in this book, an obvious byproduct of his reassessment after trouble wit the law. Contemporary readers will find ample evidence of his moral ground in this work which may help to explain policies created and espoused by the Bush administration today."
2,Certainly not Karen's best work,"Okay for diehard fans that just can't wait to get their hands on anything Karen writes. But somewhat disappointing compared to her gripping novels ""Formula Father"" and ""It Happened One Wedding Night."""
5,Best Autobiography I've Read!,"This is the best autobiography from George Bush I've ever read. It clearly shows Bush's side of his struggles with Alchoholism, Cocaine abuse and Business failure. His surprisingly fresh sense of humor neatly balances his harrowing accounts of the action and bloodshed in Vietnam that he witnessed on T.V. while safe at home in the National Gaurd where he trained to fly out-moded jets. George is a hero for our age. Who better to represent our country in it's declinig years than an illegitimate ""president"" with a third-graders grasp of our world. God DOES have a sense of humor."
5,A Charge to Keep,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about this man who might become president. As an elementary teacher, I found his ideas about education very inspiring. ""Leave no child behind."" I found the book easy to read but full of information about George W. Bush as a man, a father, a husband, a son, and a leader."
1,A Pointless Book,"This empty tome, and it is empty, contributes nothing to our knoweldge of George W. Bush. Since Bush has lived an empty, sheltered life, there really isn't anything worth putting in a book. So, instead we get treated to a repetitious series of time-worn campaign slogans.This is a book for the already converted. Anyone looking for some real, in-depth information on George W. Bush will have to go elsewhere."
1,And Yet People Continue To Support This Man,"Karen Hughs, Bush's ghostwriter, produced this tome in order to boost her employer's image. George W. Bush, however, is so lacking in intellectual curiosity and personal achievement that the best she could come up with is this vapid, ineffective screed. Hughs has managed only to conclusively prove that George W. Bush is nothing more than an empty suit living off his daddy's name. To the already converted, though, this does not matter, and they still line up to support Bush's quixotic quest for the presidency.This is a book for the gullible. Anyone with a genuine interest in who George W. Bush really is would be better served by reading Arthur Frederick Ide or Molly Ivens' biographies."
1,Is This The Promised Remake of Bedtime for Bonzo,"If you want to illustrate to the whole world just what a dullard and complete clutz you are then take heed of this book. What on earth were the ghost writers thinking, were they trying to write in true ""Bush House"" style. If they were they have suceeded beyond their wildest dreams making the dear man look as if he needs what poor old Ronnie needed in the end. 24 hour care. Who is keeping who?"
1,Lookie Here! I Done Wroted A Book!,"Well, now...I cain't lie to all you good 'mericans. Karen Huge he'ped me out A LOT on this. I'm so glad Daddy picked her for me, and this will really help put food on her family. So when y'all gettin' your tax refund back this year, buy, buy, BUY!Yep, there's a lot of things I had her leave out...the years I spent hopped up on Peruvian marching powder, the time I went on a two-year bender while AWOL from the National Guard (Yeehah! Lotta fun...gotta do that again, and soon!), the failed oil bidnesses in mah ""home"" state, that little bit o' insider tradin' I did back in the early nineties (SHHHHHhhhh!!)...but that's all behind me now. Trust me, for I am your pars'nent, and together we can all build the pie higher for my friends at ENRON.Gawd bless y'all,Dumbya"
1,One Star for publishing!,"How amazing that a man who seems incapable of stringing together several coherent sentences has the nerve to think we really believe he wrote this book! In October, he joked that he had not read a book while a ""student"" at Yale, but he has ""written"" a book."
5,A Wonderful Biography!,"I was extremely pleased with George W. Bush's biography. It showed me parts of his life that really make me believe he is a ""compassionate conservative."" I am glad I voted for him and sincerely hope he wins the election, because judging from his life story described in detail in this life, I believe he has everything it takes and much more to lead this country for the next four years."
5,Gw Bush is a great Prezident!,"People who dont like ""dub-yah"" (as his dad the ist bush )herber Walker, jr. called him when he (GWB) was a kid in the past) arent good people of the USA if you ask me. if you watch the media which is read by democrats you get the idea that bush is not bright. this is wrong -- he's as bright as 1000 lightbulbs which is another thing that his dad said. it doesn't bother me that he doesn't read he has more to do than read while fighter wars to help others be able to go to church like we (usa) do. all clinton ever did was read. he needed to read less."
5,Good for it's purpose!,"This is not a monumental piece of literature, but it was not writen to change the world. The books job was to tell the people who George W. Bush is, and it accomplished this job very well! It covers his life from childhood to today. And most importaintly, is clearly states his political beliefs and convictions, so you KNOW the man well when you finish. No psychobabble, no theories, just cold, hard facts on the content of his character. By the way, conserning his ""Jesus Christ"" answer as his favorite philosopher in the debate...if you think that a part, even a very small part, of that answer was political positioning, you NEED to get this book! This is not a boaring preachy read, just a good man shareing his past and present self, as well as his optimistic view of the future."
1,veracity is hard to come by,"Even conservatives such as Tucker Carlson can see straight through Karen Hughes:Tucker Carlson suggested last year that her willingness to lie for Bush ""almost crosses over ... into mental illness.""This is little more than a campaign leaflet for Mr. Bush. Don't waste your time."
2,Perhaps I should check out what Molly has to say,"W's autobiography leading into the 2000 presidential election. Good insight into Bush's heart and I like him a lot better now (I voted for Gore), but I was never sure what I could believe. At times it seemed like the book was one big endorsement for his campaign. Additionally, I didn't take much from the biography as far as lessons about life go; Bush was good at bouncing around randomly from various events in his life."
1,A fantasy!,"A waste of paper...the dishonesty, the media manipulation, the immorality, the application of situational ethics continue in this poor effort to influence the way history will treat his presidency."
1,Horrible,"This book is rife with spelling errors. As far as subject matter, simply do a search on Google for ""I hate liberals"" and copy/paste the results and bind it. Then you'll have this book. Nothing intelligent is in it. There are plenty of books about Bush that are far better than this book. I recommend ""A Matter of Character"" and ""Misunderstood"", and possibly ""A Man of Faith."""
5,Keeping the Faith,"It's not easy to be republican in this era of soft liberal politicing but it's books like this that provide some stamina to old conservative warhorses like myself. The charge of the liberal media is that Bush lacks a detailed vision for this country. Not surprisingly, they obviously haven't read this book. This book details Bush's aspirations and specific plans for this nation. Highly recommended"
2,Typical Campaign Biography,"As a huge George W. Bush fan, I was anxiously looking forward to reading his book. I couldn't have been more disappointed. This book is as one sided as they come. It is your typical campaign biography. It tells little of George W. Bush's low points or his failures. It pawns him off as a near perfect businessman, politician, family man, and person. It is unrealistic and it is hard to take the substance (what his views are) seriously because of this. If you are looking for a informative book about Bush, this is not the one. It will give you only the good parts of our President."
1,Brain Freeze,"Simply put, re-reading this book would infect my brain. I've never read such immemorable, meaningless rhetoric before, and I hope I never shall again. Beware especially of his ""masterful"" explanation of why education ""doesn't work"" and why welfare-esque religion will be the ""saving grace"" of the nation. Steer clear of this book at all costs!"
1,Stupid is as stupid does,Amazing. Incredible. Comparing this book and what is now going on in the White House leads one to categorize this book as fanatasy or non-fiction.
5,A Charge To Keep,"I was raised in a family facinated by American politics. I have long admired the Bush family. They continue to hold their heads up high, and not be draged down by the ungruly press. I loved reading the first hand account of this President. He is a person, with flaws, but able to admit them. More importantly He is a man with character, depth, and sensitivity. I loved reading this book!!"
1,"George W. Bush, what a piece of work","""During my time at Yale I joined the Skull & Bones, a society so secret I can't mention anything else about it"" What does that mean? Is the ""leader"" of the world's greatest democracy beholden to unseen masters of a necrophiliac cult? It's obvious the guy is an empty suit and it's obvious someone else ghost wrote this book for a man who clearly would have been consigned to special ed were it not for his name. But whose tool is W? How did they steal the election in Florida? Isn't it obvious that they planned this war before the election?"
4,Looks good and works good,I purchased this item in Nov. 06. I really liked the design and the option of choosing different colors. It works very well and looks great on my counter. It is easy to use when you need a sprinkle of pepper and salt when cooking and I like the lever on the bottom to control how much pepper you want. I liked it so much I plan to purchase more as housewarming gifts. The only thing that I can't comment on is how to refill.
3,Beware the Gaps!,"This is an imported incarnation of Furtwangler's gut wrenching wartime recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic, of Beethoven's middle four symphonies. Though with excellent sound and fidelity rage--sonically as good as the EMI recordings after the war--this transfer has a VERY SERIOUS FLAW: In the Fifth and Sixth symphonies where one movement flows into the next, the engineers have put in gaps between the numbered bands! Imagine in the Fifth symphony the hushed tones of the Allegro (third movement) building up to the towering crescendo which crashes into the Finale, only to hear the whole wall of sound stop for a full two seconds before the three cords of the Finale are heard! The same happens twice in the Pastoral. O wretched ignorance. What a ruination of otherwise unmatched performances of this music."
5,Buy this book immediately!,This is one of my top 10 favorite books of all times. It is a beautiful coming of age portrait of a young woman.
1,IT BLOWS,"What an incredibly disappointing, long-winded, and poorly written book. This is perhaps one of the more frustrating novels I've ever powered through. I perservered through poorly drawn characters, a redundant narrative, and Nancy's tortured romantic desires only to have the story wrap up in five (ok maybe six pages) in which I learn our main characters never realize their romantic love for each other and both go on to have uninspired, if not personally disappointing lives. An incredibly disheartening novel that's just not worth the mental energy. Save yourself. Don't waste your money or time."
1,Total Downer,"This is the book you read if you want to punish yourself for being a romantic. This book takes you from the total high you have when starting a new book, to the point of just wanting to cry and scream at the impossible blindness of the characters. And that was not a compliment of wonderful writing on the writers behalf. Nina wrote this long ass story that takes you on this wild ride that never finishes. IT never reaches a climax. It just builds and builds untill she drops the bomb that nothing good happens for the two main characters. You'd be better of saving your money and going to a funeral."
3,It Blows? Well written!,"It was a well written piece. The only problem is you get frustrated. However, you get frustrated because you want the main character to get the girl - her step sister. You get into the book and that is what makes it wonderful. You might not even notice how into it you are until the end. The frustration comes from all the feelings that go through Nancy's head when she sees her. I feel the same way when I like a girl...lmao! To Nancy's suprise, her father marries the girls mother. It got worst for her but one learns not to hold back. If you like someone say something. Otherwise, you will be just like Nancy with all the ""what if's"" and ""I don't knows"" and ""Maybe this"" or ""Maybe that""."
4,Worth Reading,This is a good book... all through it you'll be wondering if (and hoping) something is going to happen between the two main characters. It's a real life depiction though.. and there aren't always happy endings...
5,Great Video,"I would HIGHLY reccomend that you get the Jim Tolles book/cd package that goes along with the video.The video is great, nice and slow, Jim is a great instructor for those teaching themselves!Best thing I've found is to watch and play along with the video for a few sections. Then spend the rest of practice time with the book/cd to fill in the gaps, and to get some extra practice.Alone they are both fine products, but together is ideal!"
2,Could be better,"Hi! Intro to Violin is a good primer for playing the violin, but the program is a bit too fast. I've had to stop the tape and repeat many sections, before progressing.I still think the best way is to get a personal instructor."
1,buy a different cookbook,"If you enjoy ""cooking"" with pringles, jello and miracle whip, then this ""cookbook"" is for you! The opening pages have many typos and repetition of sentences, which I at first thought was a mistake. But as I read the recipes I began to realize that inane repetition may just be the author's style. The ""over 200 recipes"" are basically just slight variations of one recipe, for example the Snack menu is as follows: Recipe 1: cottage cheese, apple, almonds. Recipe 2: cottage cheese, orange, almonds. And so on for one and a half pages! Little creativity exists in the recipes and most are just the previous recipe with one change (instead of writing ""try this with pork or chicken"", the whole recipe is re-written for a one-ingredient change.) This is a cookbook for the unimaginative."
2,"Rice, cinnamon sugar and potatoes-Not quite the Zone Diet","I was disappointed. Many of the recipes have simple starches as more than a condiment, which does not correlate to the Zone. For example, Pepperidge Farm light wheat bread, white rice, Stove Top chicken stuffing mix, egg noodles, potatoes, brown sugar and lasagna noodles are among those Zone unfriendly foods listed as ingredients and used in the recipes in this book.But maybe for those with kids, this may be a good compromise of preparing typical food while eating in something similar to the Zone diet. On the flip side, the author could have substituted fructose, eggplant, and wild rice and other ingredients to make the recipes more in the Zone, but many of these recipes are not in the zone."
2,Disappointed,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this book. I feel very ripped off by it.It does not follow the Zone recommendations, as others mention here. There is a lot of hidden sugar (for instance, one recipe calls for 9 T of ketchup, which is LOADED with sugar). Alcohol is used in a lot of the recipes, there is lots of bread and jam. As someone else mentioned, I couldn't believe the pringles. Also, much of the carbo stuff is not fresh produce. Almost every salad in the dinner selection includes mandarin oranges and the dressing is made with the sugary mandarin orange syrup.Basically, the book completely disregards a lot of the core Zone principles, and is loaded with insulin spiking sugars, a lot of them hidden.Andrea"
3,A disappointment to a long-time Wilcox fan,"Compared to the previous Wilcox novels, ""Plain and Normal"" is flat and uninteresting. The two plots do not reflect one another, and they do not mesh in any meaningful way. I hope new readers of Wilcox will not judge his work by this novel. Please read the delightful and masterful ""Modern Baptists"" or ""Guests of a Sinner."""
1,Like a Russian Novel.....,"In defense of Mr. Maloney, add me to the ""What the hellwas that?"" club.To quote Frank McCourt, ""........those russian novels, where after 400 pages, the peasant commits suicide, and you wish he'd done it on page 4?""There is not one character that I felt any liking for. Our hero is a wuss, his life is pathetic, and everyone around him is despicable. However, at the end of the book, he is still a wuss, his life still pathetic, those around him are still wretched, and two completely unimportant characters shack up and throw a housewarming party.In fact, the suicide-on-page-400 would have been the highlight of this book. I did not get that pleasure.This is Seinfeld in print. Which I find equally un-funny and pointless.My apologies, Mr. Wilcox. But I have a feeling that this book was for your own amusement, and not that of your readers. My friend had a joke like that, where after 45 minutes of build-up one came to realize that there is no punch line. It just goes on and on...."
4,Nice unit,"Received my compressor yesterday, nice looking robust and heavy unit worth the money, was shipped rather quickly, packaging was outstanding, ABF freight company one of the best shippers around, one complaint is the my unit had 7 scratches on the front and was retouched with touch up paint probably at factory ,quite obvious, but not enough to refuse shipment though, thats why 4 stars and not 5, havent wired it yet hope my unit doesnt have the rod knock like the other poster's unit did. Will post another on startup, cross your fingers..."
1,Porter Cable C7550,"I ordered this after checking local competitors for prices on similar units. The price couldn't be beat. I received it in perfect condition the crating was spectacular and was better than expected. I didn't have any troubles hooking it up and running it either. The unit runs flawless! Very pleased with this compressor on initial purchase and use.Update: as of 2/7/2012 the compressor head unit is shot: a severe rod knock and the reed valves on high pressure head destroyed. Will need a new compressor head unit. Had this since April 2009. Not very good longevity since I had a 60 gallon campbell hausfield for 14 years plus without a single problem. And it's still in use! Regular maint done, .... oil changes etc....just a cheap compressor head and will not hold up for very long. Stay away from this unit it is poorly made!"
2,Not that great.,"This item is not that durable. Also, the battery compartment if very difficult to close and then when we wanted to open it, we couldn't. Dissappointed that the wind ranges are not actuallying on the item. Does not really register any wind unless it is alot to get all three lights to light up. Low wind speeds do not register the first two lights (or the lower range). Would have been nice to have the ranges listed right on the item.Also the 30 fantastic activities are not fantastic. The one my son was most excited about is making lighting. I was curious as to what they would have him do too. All they have you do is put a blanket over your head and pull it off to creat a static charge. Does not work all that well. Must really really watch and try it many many times before actually getting the ""lighting"".Overall this item did not meet my expectations nor does it hold my sons attention. Another toy sitting on the shelf collecting dust."
3,"Nicely Packaged, Slim of Activities","As a teacher I was disappointed in how little you can do with this kit. I was expecting a more substaintial teaching tool. It was enough for a 5/6 year old, but not beyond"
3,"OK, lots of small parts",I ordered this for my son who is 7 years old and I think it would be more appropriate for a mucholder child who could use without 100% supervision.
2,A book about the victums of WWII,"Famous leaders and their deeds and the problems they faced and how they managed them is not what this book is about.It smacks of being a PC version of what damage was done by the war. Dresden was a bad mistake but fire bombing Tokio and the major cities of Germany and the atomic bombings was not. But even in the case of Dresden, we hated these people who took us out of our innocent lives and put us at the mercy of the Japanese prison guards. You had to be there."
4,very readable account of WWII,The onset of the Nazi movement is treated but very shortly.A lot of information could be easier presented with more geographical maps about the situation at hand.The reading itself is easy and the general line is good to follow.
2,Noisy,"I bought this fan based on reviews that it was one the quietest of the field. Unfortunately, it hums and has a minor vibration., even with replacement motor and blade. I had to isolate the steel mounting tabs between two pieces of medium firmness packing foam, and then mount it with plywood over the foam, screwing it to the studs through the plywood making sure that the screws didn't touch the fan's mounting tabs. It is barely quiet enough so we are able to be in the master bathroom and bedroom that is below the fan.It is sad that, with all of the technology we have, we cannot make a motor that doesn't hum and a a blade that is balanced."
5,a good read not a handbook,"This is not a how to book or a resource book it is about one woman raising her daughter. Although some parts are a little more hard core then i am going to do with my own children I do feel that many of the points she made were good and can be applyed to an unschoolers way of life as well as to help give you the answers to questions like ""well that's the way life is, how will they ever learn about 'real' life?"""
5,Every parent should read this book!,"Finally a book about peaceful, gentle, respectful parenting! Valerie Fitzenreiter shares experiences from her unschooled daughter Laurie's childhood, and insights into a radical way of parenting. Valerie and Laurie's story will inspire any parents who strive for a closer, more fulfilling relationship with their child/ren.If you are interested in unschooling, want to raise a child in freedom, or simply want to improve your relationship with your child/ren, buy this book!"
3,way far left,"I do not agree with her method. As a look into her slice of life it is very interesting. I do not agree that a child should decide when they want to learn to read. I agree that you should follow your child's interests, but reading and counting are essential skills not elective skills."
2,Smug parenting,"I read this book expecting to love it -- I am beginning to unschool my daughter, and I'm eager to hear about other people's experiences. I also agree with most of the author's parenting philosophy, and believe that her daughter turned out to be a wonderful, happy person. Yet the tone of this book is annoyingly self-righteous and strangely narrow-minded. There is no room in the author's view for the validity of other parents' choices for their children; in her opinion, if they persue more traditional paths of raising kids, they are just plain wrong. I was disappointed. The book is also unfortunately poorly edited, with many basic grammatical errors. I am still all for the philosophy behind Ms. Fitzenreiter's book, but I wish it had been written with a more open-minded spirit and more skillfully."
4,Why I do what I do,"I honestly disagreed with about 80% of this book - but it was GREAT! It forced me to think about why I do what I do as a parent and teacher to my kids. Also, the 20% I agreed with had a SERIOUS impact on my parenting. This book teaches a parenting style that is totally child driven which I didn't agree with yet there was so much grace and respect for children as people that I was forced to see where I was not respecting my own kids (much to my own suprise) and how to improve on my relationships with each of my 4 kids. Agree or disagree, this author makes you think about why you do what you do with your kids!"
2,Not what I'd hoped,"We have been ""unschooling"" since birth- not radically, but very child led. I was disappointed in the broad generalizations made by this author seemingly based on her expierience with her one female child. Having 4 children, 2 boys and 2 girls- I just don't see her particular method of unschooling working for every child or all families. It seemed to me that nearly each chapter had some sweeping statement about ""all children"" ""we parents"" etc. I'm glad it worked out so well for her and her girl- but I'd love to see her take my 3rd child- a boy and have it work out just the same. She seems to not recognize that all children are different and while her radical unschooling and unparenting worked for her- it is not as one sided as she presents it to be."
1,The only book I have ever thrown in the trash,"We are an AP family, homeschoolers, with a definite leaning toward unschooling. I expected to love this book, and yet it ended up going in the trash because I couldn't even bear to pass it on to someone else. The author practically has her judgment of anyone who does things differently than she did dripping from the pages. All I could think of as I read it was ""Well, sure you can do that if you only have one child."" The moment you enter a sibling into that environment you have chaos. I think it's absolutely wonderful the author was able to raise her daughter the way she did. I would have appreciated it better if I hadn't felt that she feels very superior to anyone who does otherwise."
1,No Way Out is a terrible In Your House,"This video lacks action and good matches -- the main event isn't even that good, unless you like hardcore wrestling."
2,In Your House : No Way Out,"With the event of the ""HBK"" no-show, the WWF was forced to scramble for a main event replacement. Savio Vega definitely does not fit those ramifications. So we are left with an 8-man tag, no DQ, anything goes, main event which was really centred around Austin and his bid for Wrestlemania. The WWF needs established superstars like 'Taker, Michaels and Austin. Two of those three were sorely missed on this occasion. This is for die-hard Austin fans who want to see 'the rattlesnake' carry the organisation toward WM XIV. END"
3,WWF No Way Out 1998,"The Headbangers vs Goldust w/Luna Vachon and Marc Mero w/SablePretty good opening match. Tad bit long though. 7/10WWF Lightheavyweight TitleTaka Michinoku (C) vs PanteraVery entertaining. Great Match. 8/10NWA North American TitleJeff Jarrett (C) w/Jim Cornette vs BradshawPretty boring. But worth watching. 6/10The Quebecers ve The GodwinnsVery boring. You might wanna fast forward through this. 4/10Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, and DOA vs Nation of DominationPretty entertaining. Some high spots. 8/10Mask MatchVader vs Kane w/Paul BearerGood match. One of the best on the tape. 8/10Stone Cold, Owen Hart, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie vs DX and Savio VegaThis should never had been a main event on a PPV. But very entertaining nonetheless. 9/10WWF No Way Out 1998 is just a buildup PPV to WWF Wrestlemania XIV. Not worth your money unless you are a hardcore wrestling fan. 6/10"
3,Could have been better!!!!!!!,"First of all here are the matches Match 1- The Headbangers vs Marc Mero and Goldust I gave it an 4 out of 10 because it was worthless Match 2- WWF Lightheavyweight Championship Taka Michanoku vs Pantera I gave it an 7 out of 10 because of the high risks Match 3- The Godwinns vs The Quebecers I gave it an 3 out of 10 because it was also worthless Match 4- Justin Bradshaw vs Double J I gave it an 2 out of 10 because of the worthless wrestling Match 5- 8-Man Tag Team Match Ken Shamrock,Ahmed Johnson,and D.O.A. vs The Nation of Domination Igave it an 6 out of 10 because it was pretty good Match 7- Kane vs Vader I gave it an 7 out of 10 because it had a suprising end Match 8- 8-Man Tag Team No Holds Barred Match Stone Cold,Owen Hart,Cactus Jack,and Chainsaw Charlie vs Triple H,The New Age Outlaws, Savio Vega (replacing Shawn Michaels) I gave it an 8 out of 10 because of the weapons Overall Rating 6 out of 10 DON'T BUY"
1,WHAT WAS THIS!?,"What was this!? This whole PPV was pathetic! Every match was terrible, some matches I had to fast forward through because they where so boring they almost made me go to sleep! The main event was the only good match on the whole card, while all the others where horrible."
2,OK PPV WOULD HAVE BEEN 5 STARS IF SHAWN MICHAELS SHOWED UP,Ok PPV some good matches alot of weapons and blood
3,GREATEST TAG MAIN EVENT YOU WILL SEE,"The matches that stood out was taka vs pantera and classic main event!The rest of the ppv was mid card raw matches.The main event was awesome with a whole heeps of weapons including barb wire which was wrapped around cactus jack ....surprise surprise.......at start it was a mad brawl then quited down in to great tag action..The highlight of that match was when austin picked up the bin in his corner and pegged it at billy gunn an got him right in the face.Overall if you are a big wwf fan this for you for the main event only, if you are just getting into the wwf i would select a newer ppv such as wrestlemania 17, but by all meens do try and watch this some how!"
3,An OK Pay Per View,Pretty good PPV. The undercard disapointed me a bit but I really enjoyed Kane vs. Vader and the 8 man tag was pretty good. Not the best I've seen but worth buying.
2,"DON""T GET IT","Let's see. Headbangers vs. Mero and Goldust what a boring match. The light heavyweight match would of been good if it weren't for Too Sucky doing commentaty. Plus Pantera and Taka are retarts.I don't have to go in to details about the thrid and fourth match because they just sucked. The War of Attrition was o.k. Vader vs. Kane was just o.k because it is so clear that Vader was going to lose. But the unsanctioned match rocks. Trash cans, tables, even barbed wire, but the best part is when Austin Stuned Chyna"
2,Not The Best,"There were only two good matches, the 8 man tag war and kane vs Vader. The rest were too slow or just plain boring."
3,It might be great but !,"It looks niceLot of features and accessoriesRange 1 to 2 Mile max.Catalouge is very poor, doesn't include how to log with repeaters and how privacy code to be choosen upon.It doesn't cover the range I wanted to cover less than 5 KM apporx 2.5 miles but there is no way out that is the only 5 watt in the range I will keep it and see if I get any feedback from Midland about repeaters and codes"
1,"Any ""zero star"" to rate it?","This is a ""damn garbage"" item. You can only communicate in about less than 2 miles distance. Do not buy this item."
2,Middle of the road or on a clear day.,"These GMRS radios have very limited range on land. If on water and in a low radio noise area they actually may get 18 miles but everywhere else maybe only two miles on hilly land and 0 feet if behind a hill. It's not the GMRS radio but the frequency in the VHF band. There are repeaters which will extend the range. The NOAA radio section works very well but I have not USED the alert portion. Over all it was what I expected. Don't count on the advertisment of ""18 miles."" Also, you need an FCC license to use this radio. $85, and it cannot be used for business purposes, although I see this all the time. This could cause you to have a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in the pokey if you disrupt communications."
2,signal range,I bought this radio for a friend who lives in EU. he is highly disappointed of low signal range of radios when they are used in a city. He states that it does not have range more that 0.5 miles.
3,so far so good,"I just recently purchased this product. My wife and I tested it on my way to work. It did seem to work well for at least 3 miles on my way to work. This is not what the manufacturer said, but I had already figured that to be the case. Once I did ge to work though, the building seemed to decrease it's effectiveness dramatically. We plan on using this when we go to New Orleans on a mission trip. I will let you know how it works then. I do love the recharger though. Until then.."
3,My experience with these radios,"The service and shipping of the product was good from Amazon!!!However, I am not fully satisfied with the transmitting distance of these radios, they fail at less than a mile in most circumstances...IE between buildings, rolling terrain, or trees...on and on....and this is at full power, I bought two sets=4radios from two different vendors and they are both the same in performance."
1,Terrible,I am a wedding director and purchased these radios to communicate with my partner during weddings. The reception was poor and the volume was low. We couldn't communicate two doors down from each other. We ended up using our cell phones all day long. What a waist!!!
1,GREAT PRICE BUT THEY DO NOT WORK,"I PURCHASED THESE HOPING THE EXTRA WATTS (5) WOULD BE GREAT FOR TALKING FAR DISTANCES. FIRST OF ALL, THE VOLUME DOES NOT GO UP HIGH ENOUGH TO EVEN HERE THE OTHER PERSON. YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR MOUTH RIGHT UP TO THE WALKIE TALKIE IN ORDER FOR THE OTHER PERSON TO HERE YOU AND THEN ITS MUFFLED. MY OLD MOTOROLA T6400 WALKIE TALKIES ARE SO MUCH BETTER EVEN WITH ONLY 1 WATT. THEY WERE CRYSTAL CLEAR AND THE VOLUME WENT UP PLENTY LOUD. YOU HAD TO LOWER THE VOLUME IN FACT. THEY REACHED FURTHER THAN THESE TOO. SO WHEN I PURCHASED THESE, I WAS HOPING TO TOP THE MOTOROLAS BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE. MY KIDS LITTLE COBRA 5 MILE RANGE WALKIE TALKIES THAT WERE ONLY 29 BUCKS FOR THE PAIR WITH THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WORK MUCH BETTER THAN THESE. THEY JUST DONT HAVE PRIVACY CODES OR THE WHEATHER ON THEM. SO I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY. INSTEAD, BUY A PAIR OF MOTOROLAS. MY MODEL NUMBER THEY DO NOT HAVE ANYMORE BUT ANY THING IS BETTER THAN THESE. IAM SURPRISED AT MIDLAND."
4,600/650 Review,"These have great features and a lot of them. In practice, you can consistantly receive a transmission from about 3 miles. They are worth the money."
1,Good ONLY for Around The House!,"I live in a flat suburban area. Range is LESS than 1/2 mile at best. Average range on any daily time used was LESS than 1/4 mile. Works wonderfully as a pager from one room to the other when I was recovering from 2 major surgeries. But, I ended up buying a little $3.00 BELL to ring instead & sold these toys to a neighbor. WELL built, just don't see any use for them when they have NO range!"
4,Good for women's strength and flexibility.,I like these short workouts. You get to work areas you need more strength and flexibility for golf.
3,Great recipe for vegetable stock!,"This book supplied me with some much-needed advice on preparing meatless meals for a diabetic. However, ADA guidelines (as explained to me by a dietician) now use the number of carbohydrates as a guideline for most meals and this book failed to list the carbohydrate content of any of the dishes, which was a disappointment to me. Otherwise, I feel the book is a good start for someone who finds they are at a loss on how to prepare dishes which are both meatless and suitable for diabetics."
5,Fantastic Reading - Great Insight into historical characters,"Although he took some creative license when developing the characters and the dialog for Eagle's Cry and 1812, David Nevin generated more interest for me in the early years of our country then years of history in school could ever hope to accomplish. You can really appreciate the trials our young nation faced with this ""great experiment"" called democracy after reading his books. Because of books like this (and Jeff & Michael Shaara's for the Civil War Era), I've bought numerous other books that have helped humanize the early history of our country in my mind."
1,Dolley Madison noticed Sally Hemmings?,"I am certain that Mr. Nevin did his homework, and I am aware that this is a ""work of fiction"". However, I have difficulty with the fact that Thomas Jefferson is referred to as ""Tom"", James Madison is ""Jimmy"", and Alexander Hamilton is ""Alex"".I did not see the movie Pearl Harbor released this May, but the main complaint about the movie fits this book- we should not project today's culture on historical events. Nurses during WWII did not wear bikinis, and I suspect that stable hands in 1800 did not discuss politics with the Secretary of State."
3,"Long, but good read","Nevin's 1812 was a fantastic book that covered a portion of American history unknown by most. Eagle's Cry isn't as compelling, and lacks the action that made 1812 fun, but is well worth reading by those who appreciate well-researched, good historical fiction."
1,Poor History,"The one excerpt I read from this book - a conversation between Dolley and 'Jimmy' Madison regarding Sally Hemings and her sister 'Betsey', calling Jefferson 'Tom' and referring to Sally and 'Betsey' as 'toddlers' when they came to Monticello - reveals the worst research I have ever seen on the subject, a complete lack of knowledge of the period, and the sort of 'First Name/Last Name' reference common to uneducated writers writing historical fiction of late.With all due respect, Madison's nickname was 'Jemmy'; Sally Hemings' sister BETTY Brown was a good deal older than a toddler when she came to Monticello (Sally was a year old and thus a toddler); and Mr. Jefferson was known to his VERY intimate friends as Thomas; and Mrs. Madison would hardly have lectured her husband on Martha Wayles Jefferson - a women her husband knew well and she not at all.I shudder to think what the rest of this book is like, if this half-page is any example! One star because I can't give it zero."
3,"fascinating, but","Nietzsche was obviously already over the edge when he wrote this. There are some striking passages, but also some very embarrassing and juvenile ones. In the end, it is primarily a monument to megolamania and paranoid grandiosity."
2,Boring,"I bought this book because I know that Nietzsche is considered one of the most important philosophers of all times and wanted to learn something about him. I tried before to read ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" but it was very hard to understand anything, so I decided to buy his autobiography in the hope of finally learning something.The book is hard to read, his ideas are not clear, but at least the book is thin so you can read it fast (one day is enough). Thanks god (oh, I forgot he is dead!)! I would not read it to the end if it were thicker.The conclusion is: if you are not an expert in philosophy or had not attended to many lectures explaining Nietzsche, do not waste your time reading this book. Read the explanations of Nietzsche's thoughts by other authors and you will learn much more."
1,Brewer,"As with Bocelli, packaging was poor and CD case was broken. CD okay but would like a replacement for the CD case."
5,Miss Music,"This is a splendid collection of Teresa Brewer recordings for Coral, including many tracks never before on C.D. This repertoire here reflects her versatility and reminded us how many two-sided hits she recorded. Coral had a special affinity for recording Brewer effectively--capturing the tangy texture and sharp edge of her voice while surrounding her with cozy orchestrations. From ballads to novelties, the music here is consistently polished and entertaining. A throughly enjoyable C.D."
3,Why buy here?,You can purchase this item from the artist's website (www.markryden.com) for $25.00+S&H.
4,multi track gem,Unlike other reviewers I purchased this Cd for the album Apache. I bought it back in '62 as a compliment to my Duane Eddy and Les Paul records. Les Paul was the first to experiment with multi track playback. Jorgen Ingmann carried on that tradition. Eddy played in the lower registers and Ingmann played in the opposite. The songs sound a bit dated now but they were standads when released. I do agree that the musicianship might not be on the level of Les Paul but Apache/The Many Guitars of Jorgen Ingmann will fit in nicely with the early '60's Ventures and Duane Eddy albums.
4,Good but...,"Like many of my albums, I bought this for just one song. ""Apache"". I recently picked up the Shadows version and wanted to compare. Previous to that, I had only heard Jorgen's version but it was many years ago. While this original version brings back some pleasant memories, the musician in me has to agree that the Shadows arrangement is better."
1,A disappointing CD,"I bought the CD based on my memory of Apache - a big hit for Jorgen Ingman in 1960/61. As it turns out, that's one of three or so songs on this dual-album worth keeping. I had hoped the version of Cherokee on this CD was the one I recall having heard around 1962, but unless my memory is faulty, the version here is more gimmicked-up, and much less worth hearing. All in all, a disappointing purchase."
4,"Fantastic silverware, great price","My cousin bought me this silverware for Christmas, and I only had four place settings. I wanted to get at least another set but figured I would have to fork out a pretty penny to get it. Low and behold I found my pattern on Amazon at a price that was AMAZINGLY low. So I ordered two more sets and have plenty of matching silverware now. Wonderful!"
4,Got my feet wet and then left me wanting more.,While looking for books on folklore in general I stumbled upon this gem of a book.To be completly honest I am a newbie to the whole folklore world but this book was written in a way where I felt like Goldielocks and it was just right.It is well written with enough of the authors own personal quips to keep it from venturing too far into acedemia style.It was deep enough to get my feet wet but it was a bit short (I finished it in one sitting) so it left me wanting more on the subject.The author did a good showing that folklore is still alive and well in the United States.
2,A good resource for paper but the disc is almost useless,"If you are taking the Praxis test, then you should know there are two formats: paper and computer based.For a Praxis reveiw resource the book is okay, but there are better: like the books published ETS, the Praxis designer, and Kaplan. So if you are taking the Praxis paper-based test, the book may help you.However, if you are taking the Praxis computer-based test then be aware that on of the paper tests in the book is duplicated as one of the two tests on the CD. When I discovered the duplication I felt cheated. I was hoping for different tests on the CD, which I think is a reasonable expectation.Overall, this book was a let down."
4,good book in great condition and recieved it in good time.,I would like to know if there is a disk with the book if it is included and if it has been open and used. What condition is the book in. Be truthful and charge me what the book is worth and not what you think it is worth. This was a great book in great condition.
3,Bloating,If you suffer from constant bloating due to gas than this product works to help releive gas. In that way I guess it would help acheive a flatter stomach.
3,Looking for mood music?,"As mood music goes this isn't bad. The best music I've heard was on the radio while in Hawaii. I don't know why I can't find That! Nevertheless, this isn't bad for imagining yourself on the beach at Waikiki with the sun shining down on you. Hawaiian music tends to be...active...and when setting a romantic mood, something more soothing is best. This works."
5,A very talented young woman! Love this CD,"I must agree with the other positive comments here. I've been a fan of Raiatea's work ever since I heard songs from her first release. I love all of her cds equally; but this cd really is the highlight of her career. I was just back on O'ahu in September (08) and was able to see her perform at the Hawai'i Theatre on her ""Hawaiian Blossom"" tour. For those of you who know Hawai'i and when I say ""chicken skin"" you'll know what I mean. I almost wish a live cd came out from that performance alone. I've been to many of a concert in my day; I would have to put that in the top 3 that I've ever been to. People asked me what the highlight of my last trip back was... I tell them the Raiatea concert! I met her afterwards and she is so kind and gracious. I live on the mainland, East Coast and she will be touring in early 2009 -- I've already purchased tickets for one of the venues! Don't miss either one of her releases!"
3,Not all organic is the same!,this product contains gelatin and other ingredients. tastes great and my baby likes it but I prefer to feed her foods with less additives.
3,"Product is good, packaging needs improvement",The packaging is rather painful to open. They should design these with parents of new babies in mind. Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top. No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber. It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.
3,Ingredients listed on this page are incorrect.,As of the date of this posting the ingredients listed on this page are incorrect. Please check the Gerber webpage for the correct ingredients.
1,Tuna oil?,"If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid certain amounts, yet it is okay to add to a babies food? And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna. This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic. Garbage, complete and total garbage."
1,Contains Tuna Oil from tuna that lives in the ocean. NOT ALL THAT COMPLETELY ORGANIC!!!,"Okay were do I start, how about this may not be a wise source of DHA for your child. Watch a movie called Autism: Made In The USA, so you will know why. The movie is free on YouTube. This baby food product contains the FDA approved amount of mercury, which is in the tuna oil ingredient, in this baby food product. You may not be aware, BUT, mercury never leaves the body, unless you remove it by means of medical treatment removal; look that method up as well. Mercury is not good for your child, no matter the amount, I am a mother and involved in science. Take my advice and try something a lot more organic and mercury free. It will benefit you and your child in the long run."
3,Mom is a wanna be social climber ....... daughter is abused but lives through the drug induced metnal state she was in for years,I thought the booki was interesting in that it was so much like a soap opera.It was a book I got at Goodwill so I found it a good read.
2,TOTALLY DISSAPPOINTING,"I was really dissappointed with the plot of the story. Yes, I know it's just a story, but where a mother wants to make her child insane/killed doesn't wash well with me. Most of all the knowledge that her child was being molested and had done nothing about it made my skin crawl. I basically didn't like the whole story. The only reason why I gave it two stars was because of the writing."
3,Well written,"I like Michaels' style, and unlike her Kentucky trilogy that drips with sorrow and tragedy, About Face is a step up from that. It's a good murder mystery with plenty of surprises and pretty darned hot in places (oh my!). I had a difficult time grasping Casey's character, though, and her relationship with her mother once she's out of the asylum. And why, after cutting herself with glass chards obviously put in her body lotion on purpose, would she stay in that environment? A previous reviewer is correct. Someone abused, institutionalized, and drugged for so many years would not be able to cope well in this paranoia-inducing situation as well as Casey did.Well written, morose in places, but at least Casey wasn't digging up horse bones (I'm still not over Kentucky Sunrise)."
3,Where is Fern Michaels?,I have always loved Fern Michaels but I don't love this book. There is far too much pain and suffering in the news for me to want to find it in the reading I do for pleasure.
5,"For a DOT legal conversion, this is a great kit.","I used this to replaced an older kit I had in my 1983 Porsche 928-S. The Hella quality is A+. No cheap plastic lenses or plastic backs here. Complete kit came with bulbs & the rubber dust/water cover for the back. I did swap out the bulbs with SilverStar Ultras which seem brighter than the bulbs that came with the kit. This DOT version has a metal ""cap"" inside the center of the headlight to help reduce on-coming glare. (My understanding is the non-DOT version does not have this ""cap"".)The lenses produce an outstanding light pattern and I highly recommend this kit."
5,"Sturdy construction, easy to install, and better night visibility","Sturdy construction, easy to install, and better night visibility. Lenses have DOT stamp so they will pass state inspection.Fit perfectly on a 96 miata."
5,A Work of Genius,"This experimental novel crackles and sizzles with intelligence and sardonic wit. As others here have pointed out, each chapter is a self-contained or modular unit, a complete short story. The shadowy figure of Wylie aka Tom Hanna flickers in and out of these chapters. You're never sure what lies or mayhem will follow. The prose style is hallucinatory. As someone else said, it torques up reality to an intensity that renders even the most banal act in poetic terms, while the sporadic violence is mind-numbingly intense and intimate.I can't understand why this book is currently out of print. It is a towering literary achievement, one of the greatest novels of modern times. If you're ready for a blizzard of dizzying language, a breakneck narrative drive and the intricacies of a kaliedoscopic novelistic form, then you too will love this book."
2,Well written but not engaging,Stephen Wright shows a respectable command of the English language here but ultimately this book did not engage me. The characters and situations didn't seem realistic and just weren't interesting to me. At one point he describes a wild sex party and somehow manages to make it dull. Not an awful book as it is well written and clever but not nearly a great book either.
1,BORING! TO SAY THE LEAST!,I bought this book for only 2.98 and I am glad I did not pay the cover price! There really is no plot just a bunch of characters thrown together for 300 pages with a putrid ending.Why I finished this book is beyond me AAAGGGHHHH
4,Great Book! Looking forward to more BugMan!,"This is my first Tim Downs book and I highly enjoyed it. It's rare to find a book enjoyable that is funny and gross at the same time. I learned quite a bit about insects that I didn't even think about before and I learned it while laughing. Entertaining characters make the book, not the plot. I enjoyed it so much I ordered the next two in the series. I'm a few chapters into ""Chop Shop"" and it's much more intense then ""Shoofly Pie"" so far. My only problem with the book (which may be liked by others) is that the Christian part of the book really doesn't exist except for a preacher that says a few generic sentences. I expect Christians to write Christian literature not just good clean novels that are inoffensive. Sure this book can be read by a youth but what does he learn? How did it effect his walk with Christ? For a book that will change your life read Ted Dekker or Frank Peretti. For a good fun murder mystery read Shoofly Pie."
2,It has the 3 qualities needed,"This book has all that mysteries need: an intriguing story line, a hero that's credible, and a engaging adventure as the hero solves the mystery. I don't know anything about bugs, but Downs created that scientific world that's believable."
5,"I want more ""Bug Man""!","This was an excellent, and well-written first novel featuring the ""Bug Man"", a forensic entomologist who knows his field, corpses and all. This book had some very serious comical moments- the bug man is down right hysterical with snappy comebacks, and quick wit! But, he has trouble dealing with the human ""species"". I really hope to see many more bug man novels- I can't wait for the next one! This was one of those books you just don't want to see end.I highly recommend this book to every mystery lover out there who is interested in forensics, and won't mind the sometimes graphic detail of what those critters do to our bodies once we pass on!"
5,Excellent forensic mystery novel suitable for teens and above,"While no one describes a tomato patch quite like Grisham, no one describes necrophilic-feasting insects chowing down on a decomposing body quite like Downs. I picked this novel up in the bargain bin at my local Kroger store for about $8 and it's probably the best $8 I've ever spent. I was pleasantly surprised with the deft at which Downs crafted this mystery/thriller since it was his first fiction novel. I knew nothing about Downs when I picked it up. But once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I went straight from it to Chop Shop and now have Plague Maker on pre order. Every bit as compelling as Grisham's early work and paced very much like a Dan Brown novel but unnoticeably void of any sex or foul language. I say unnoticeably because it absolutely does not detract from the suspense in any way and makes it a great novel to share with your teen reader."
4,CSI Meets House,"This is a unique take on forensic evidence with an interesting character who draws the reader in to the story. Polchak, the main character, compares very well to Dr. House, who is the title character of the new TV hit ""House.""As others have said, the book uses a very light hand in presenting Chrisianity, much like Grishom does in some of his novels.This is a great read that is hard to put down."
4,Well written,"I almost put this book down before reading one word of the story. The front page has the publisher's credo, something about ""He's coming back"" referring to Jesus and that bit of dogmatic drivel put me off. But, having a bible thumper reviewer put one of my books aside because it ""offened her christian values"" I decided to be bigger than that and read on. I found a very well written book, very creative, great characters, good plotline, just good writing all around. I am looking forward to reading the next ""Bugman"" book."
4,Another Winner,"This book is gross! I mean that with the highest admiration for Tim Downs writing ability. His character forensic entomologist Nick Polchak brings you into a world you don't want to know about, unless you love flys, bugs and rottening corpses. But I needed to know if Kathryn's friend Jimmy killed himself or was murdered? Only Nick can find the answers, with the help of his disgusting tiny friends. Tim Downs knows how to hook you and from the prologue you're heart will be racing...I would have given this five stars, but I read his book Plague Maker and it's one of my favorites."
2,unimpressive and quickly finished,"Frank exhibits knowledge of the haunts of Buffalo and back rooms of Washington in writing this mildly entertaining novel about an amoral right of center columnist clawing his pen hand through the boudoirs and dinner parties to the heights of Washington journalism. Sprinkling JB Priestly and Satchel Paige quotes and an opaque high tone writing style, the narrator takes on a George Will flavor in obscure rhetoric describing his miserable every day life; he even becomes a commentator on a Sunday talk show to complete the circle. As it was bound to happen, ruination befalls the priapic little twit; jealousy abounds, dreams are lost, columns cancelled, divorces, abandonments, and a less than sanguine ending. At the end, one question: was this a revenge book?"
5,Terrific,"Well-written, funny, thoughful. A delightful book in every respect. Just the right length too -- any longer and the souffle would have fallen. A real pleasure to read. Gets a bit frayed toward the end, but so what? Buy, read, enjoy..."
4,Original story line by Mr. Clarke is almost as good as the rewrite.,"The original story by Mr. Clarke that made the rewrite, ""The City And The Stars"", such a wonderful book, is, in itself, a very good story. The change in the main character between the two books is significant and interesting in viewing the perspective of Mr. Clarke's imagination. A good, fast read."
3,Good clean fun,"Later rewritten and published as THE CITY AND THE STARS, the original version is charming and intriguing. Somewhat quaint, perhaps, by today's standards, this science fiction-mystery makes a virtue of initiative and includes many traditional 1950s themes such as telepathy, robots and star travel. Generally areligious (although obviously materialistic, it contains only one passing snide remark towards religion) and without sexual themes or foul language (which mars so much of modern science fiction), this book is appropriate for youth as well as adults."
4,No Title,"Begun in 1937, Clarke finally finished it in 1946, his very first novel. I love sci-fi, and this didn't disappoint. Rousing good story from start to finish. Short, only 159 pages. At least, my copy. But hard to put down. I loved the way Clarke, who wrote this so many years ago, would use things of his time, and then extrapolate them to the future, as in the London Tube System - I think. For a book written over 50 years ago, it is still purely science fiction. It's only flaw is that Earth could not possible support life for the length of time he assumes - hundreds of millions of centuries. I also appreciate the way he subtly debunks religion as myths stemming from misinterpreted facts. Descriptions are easy to picture."
5,BEST Pregnancy Workout on the market,"I've purchased just about all of the available pregnancy workout dvd's on the market and this one is by far my favorite. Joy is NOT annoying like most workout instructors - she's the perfect mix of perky, sweet, and motivating. Her first trimester workout really keeps my heart thumping and my muscles burning, which I appreciate since I'm used to Jillian Michaels workouts. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who actually wants to maintain their muscle tone and cardiovascular health while pregnant. Of course there are days I just can't peel myself off the couch, but there's something so motivating about Joy's dvd that I actually look forward to my workout most days after work."
5,Great workouts!,"I purchased these dvds at the end of my 1st trimester. The workouts were really great & left me feeling like I actually worked out, unlike other pregnancy workouts. I wish I would have found these dvds sooner!"
4,My wife likes it,My pregnant wife likes this DVD set. She uses it regularly and says it is good. So I will take her word for it.
5,Doo grow growth shampoo,"I wasn't sure this was going to work, bUt to my amazement I am sure it is working very well. It smells great and it does moisturize your hair."
4,Scorching Glance,"If you've been following the manga, this DVD covers chapters 54 - 67 (Vols 6 & 7). I noticed a few differences between the manga & anime but not really anything important.This DVD contains:Ep 25 - Impact! A Decisive Flash of Lightning-(Kaoru fights Shiju)Ep 26 - Mokuren Resurrected: The Ire of the Human-Faced Tree-(Kaoru fights Mokuren, who tricks him into letting his guard down & gets trapped. Tokiya tries to save him.)Ep 27 - A Reason for Tears - The Young Girl with the Tangled Hair-(Recca fights Meno, only finding out that she is being forced to fight against her will)Ep 28 - Scorching Glance!! - Setsuna's Incineration!!-(Recca VS Genjuro)"
5,a gardener's deligh,"I read this book from the library and then bought it for myself because it is definitely a re-reading book. I have read it several times now and it amazes me every time. The depth of knowledge and the decriptions of her plants along with the distractions of her life are interesting, engaging and wonderful to read. Diane is one of my favorite authors but this book combines her scientific wordy writing style with one of my loves - plants and gardening. I read it when I'm sad and it reminds me of the wonders in the world and in my yard and neighborhood. I envy her spending so much time in her garden. I highly recommend it to plant people who like to read books besides the plant manuals that tell you how to grow things, enjoying the plants is the ultimate pleasure."
1,30+ pages were missing from the book.,30 + pages were missing from the book. It was very disappointing and I lost interest in the book as a whole
1,This is not a book for gardeners,"I have seldom come across such an amalgamation of misinformation, silliness and self-absorption as this writing contains. There is no cohesiveness, no order, no continuity even from one sentence to another. The book is filled with inappropriate, clumsy analogies and cliches; frankly, the writing is lousy. Apparently, the author believes that the reader will be fascinated by her perceptions of the world around her no matter how banal, maudlin and inane. There are many good essayists who write about gardens and gardening - don't waste your time on this messy, silly book."
3,"Protects cargo from wind and bugs, that's about it.","When you read weather resistant on the description you automatically assume that means rain and snow too, but it doesn't. I don't know what weather they are talking about. It does protect against bugs, sand, etc. but rain does seep in and so can snow once it begins to melt."
2,NOT WATERPROOF!!,"We recently used this product on a trip to Disney World. We went through several rainstorms along the way and when we arrived to our destination, everything was WET!! Lucklily we had a washer/dryer at the condo so we had to wash everything! Would not reccommend this product!"
5,It works,"I'm a rehab dietitian, and work with a lot of athletes. I saw Bill Evans speak last year in Long Beach, and discussed my concerns about age-related sarcopenia. I'm 58 years old, and in spite of the nature of my work I'd assumed loss of muscle mass was an inevitable part of aging. I'm working out with this technique 4-5 times/week. My body fat % has dropped from 22% to 17%. I estimate I've gained at least 12 lb of muscle. I'm in better shape now than I was in my 20's."
2,Good training - crummy diet,"I have to keep telling myself that I bought the book for its training tips - not for its writing style. I found it excessively wordy, repetitive, and prone to grandiose statements about Astrofit's place in the general scheme of things. The diet, for which they consulted a NASA dietician, is atrocious. Though Evans claims it is ""high protein"", it is really 60% carb, 20% protein, and 20% fat. He then claims that weight loss on low carb diets is mostly water (I'd like him to explain that to my sister who has lost 102 lbs since January on the Perricone Diet). Well, maybe when you're lifting weights you should eat tons of simple carbohydrates and sugar - far be it for me to argue with a DOCTOR. In any event, I'll do the exercises in his recommended fashion and skip his recommended eating plan. I had higher hopes for the book, though."
4,Good but expensive,"I like gamakatsu hooks, they are pretty reliable. I use them for salt water sea bass and they do very well against them. Would buy again, of I run out or of they are on sale."
4,Gamakatsu,"Good quality hooks worked well on Whiting and Bream. The hooks are very sharp, they have a very nice action through the water."
5,Great Hooks lil pricey but worth it,I ordered Size 2 in Chartreuse and 2/0 in red/They are great really sharp well designed hooks; the offset point and swept back eye really help set the hook in the fishes lip rather than the inside of their mouth or gut. Which is a good thing cause their easier to get out that way and you can get back to fishing faster and don't harm the fish as much.from 1/0 up the sizes get bigger with larger numbers from size 1 on down they get smaller as the number goes up.
4,"The only hooks I use, well almost.","In most cases there is a Gamakatsu hook that will fit the situation. They have a large selection of styles and sizes to fit just about any type of fishing. These are one of the sharpest hooks out there. This is one hook that is sharp and will stay that way until you break the tip off. Yes, the only downfall to the Gamakatsu hooks, is that they are on the brittle side. It is both what makes them the best hook. They are hard as nails so they keep the sharp. But the point of the hook will break off on the rocks. Point being they are a great hook and out perform almost all other brands and they are worth the money spent."
5,Perfect!,My box set arrived promptly and in perfect condition. The copy is authentic and was new with the plastic wrapping and all.
1,"Okay, what the heck!!","I bought this series on good faith, I love FMP (both the 1st and the...3rd?). Anyway, this is such a different series than the 1st series that i was a little caught off gaurd. Ultamitely, i found that after about 2 episodes my girlfriend and i lost interest...So, long story short, i would not suggest buying this."
4,Good Fun,"This is a fun set of episodes based on our favorite characters from Full Metal Panic and their day-to-day antics (minus any serious drama.) There's a lot of silly episodes and moments where you can't help but laugh out loud.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I wasn't drawn into episode after episode. I'd watch one or two episodes and then not touch it again for a couple of weeks. There's no story arc keeping the episodes connected (there is one arc that keeps 2 episodes together which happened to be my favorite episodes in the set) and each episode stands on it's own. It's easy then to randomly watch one episode in any order and to pick up and watch this even if you've never seen FMP. It's a lot like Family Guy or South Park in that sense and there are a lot of seriously funny moments but if you're looking for any sort of progressive development or engaging story lines, you won't find it here.Still recommended as an entertaining set of stand alone episodes."
3,Seasoned?,"The pans are great in that they are heavy and look to be well made. Unfortunately, they don't look like they've been seasoned at all. This isn't a problem, since I'm happy to go ahead and season them myself, but..."
5,The Grip to have,"I got a new bike with some adhesived on Lizard Skins which after one long ride had slipped an inch of my bars. OURY's are the Jam, last forever, stay super tacky, and have a lot of cushion for your mitts. The lock jaws prevent any slipping and it takes about 20 seconds to put these bad boys on (no glue cure time). I'm never going back to adhesive grips."
4,"Excellent grip - perfect size, good cushion","Was using the Serfas Connector grips before and had heard lots of people say this grip was great so figured I'd try. I like how the Serfas Connectors give you good gel/cushion feel, and these grips have almost as much of that softness. I find the slightly larger circumference of these grips made my hands stress less than with the Serfas Connectors so didn't miss any difference in gel/cushion feel at all."
3,Doesn't Include ODI Lock Jaw Clamp,"The product description at the time of purchase didn't clearly state that ODI Lock Jaw Clamps are NOT included. When you add that into the cost, I'm just opting for the normal Oury (non-locking) grips. I'm sure these are fine, but just more than I wanted to spend. My 3 stars has more to do with the product description rather than the product itself."
2,Not recommended,"When I received this product, the grip was already dirty and it is very hard to put it on a bike. It get dirty very easily. I don't recommend this product."
4,So much better than standard Oury grips!,"Everyone puts the standard cheap Oury rubber grips on their fixed gear bike, but I'm glad I spent a bit more for these upgraded lock-on grips. 4 stars because they only come in black (other colors would be pretty sweet)."
5,great value for a good product !!,We are very happy with the product and were also happy with the price. Would recommend this board to anyone in need of a starter type board .
3,Later still...,"This was the first TYA album I ever bought and the one I stillplay the most.Sure the version of Sweet Little Sixteen is not good...but the rest of this disc is among the most interesting and consistent work the band did. The feel of the album is less rock-blues based and more laid back than some other TYA discs...but still contains some great tunes..""She lies in the morning"" and ""my baby left me"" for instance..I really like the overall feel of this one.Plus Alvin Lee plays some really great guitar on this disc....So maybe the guys were tired after all those US tours...they still made an album that I am enjoying listening to nearly Thirty years after it was recorded....and What else matters...???."
5,The songs are still Great After all this time!,This album was a sleeper in the 1970's. The music is sophisticated rock considering the era. I'm glad to have it back in my collection after a long absence.
2,Overrated,"I just had trouble really getting into this album-it pales in comparison to ""Cricklewood Green"" and ""A Space In Time"" IMHO. Not necessarily a bad album, by any means, but lackluster."
4,Great Mixture of Artists Yield Beautiful Music,"Bill Nelson's skillful guitar blends well with Roger Eno's keyboards and Kate St. John's lyrics, giving a beautiful, lilting feeling of gentle music. This is not just background furniture music, going way beyond some of the ambient / new age sleepytime stuff on the market. Full rhythms and choruses highlight a quasi-instrumental sound you'll return to again and again."
4,Seems to be working,"Our dog has had a lifelong battle w/ skin issues- He's constantly getting yeast infections on his skin. We've used expensive sprays that were recommended by the Vet that did work but were costly. This spray, when used every day, does seem to keep the yeast at bay."
2,Just plain inexplicably stopped working,We purchased this toy last year (2008) and it was used minimally since then. After the first few months the sound started getting weaker and weaker. We tried replacing the batteries but the sound just got worse. Two months ago the toy just died and we could no longer use it. I spent money on both the LeapPad and an extra cartridge and now feel ripped off since it was clearly a defective product. We are now very careful about any product from LeapFrog since the build quality of this product was so poor that it should have never been sold.
1,Oh for the want of a spell checker.,"I had high hopes for this novel, based on reviews I read on amazon. I purchased the Nook version (sorry amazon)and was happy enough to delve into it. Within a few pages however, I was itching for a ""pen"" to start correcting obvious/blatant/ typos and missing punctuation. Granted, this can't be blamed on the author, but the editor/proof reader/ should be ashamed of themselves for letting a product this poorly edited hit the market.Now I got to the meat of the book, and was again disappointed. The prose was breezy and flowed ok, but I never got a sense of the characters (mentally or physically) and why I should give a rats patootie about their needs/desires/problems. I felt the same with the environment/landscape of the book. I never found a ""hook"" let alone a ""line"" or ""sinker"".I would not recommend this book for those flaws. A well written, interesting alternative in a similar genre is The Last Day by Glenn Kleier.The Last Day"
3,Book-Daughter of God,This book was supposed to be a precursor of the DaVinci Code but it was not anything like it. It has some similarities in references to Biblical characters but the story was very different. It was written well with lots of history of religion and kept my attention throughout. I enjoyed it very much and will recommend it.
1,This book is a small paperback.,"I am so disappointed, this book is a small paperback and it costs $8.00? I must say I am surprised because I really expected more from Amazon. I probably did not read the specs on the book properly so maybe it is my fault?Okay then, one bad step after so many good ones--and I have bought a lot from them--won't dissuade me from buying from them again, but you should be aware that this is a very, very small book. Oh, well."
5,Written BEFORE the Da Vinci Code,"This book was written three years before The Da Vinci Code. I read Daughter of God several years ago and The Da Vinci Code within the last year, and I must say that if you're looking for a book that reads like a cheap action flick, go to the Da Vinci Code, but if you want something with more depth, a better story line and more accuracy read Daughter of God.The Da Vinci Code was a knock-off, this is the real deal. It's one of the best books I've ever read and comes down off my bookshelf often."
3,Hitler and Religion,"Having read the Da Vinci code over the summer, I decided that I wanted to read another ""fictional"" religion-based book. I recieved Daughter of God for Christmas (a little ironic don't you think?). I read the book in 4 days as I found it an easy read. However, I didn't find the book very entertaining--yes, the book contains a plot about a female messiah, and it does bring in Hitler and his blackmailing of the Catholic Church with information of the female messiah, but that information only makes up a small portion of the book. The book is mostly about how many people are killed in getting the proof of the female messiah--it also goes into great detail describing said murders.While the Da Vinci Code made me question what religion passes off as truth, and what people did to get the truth out, the Daughter of God did no such thing."
2,Predictable and Boring!,"This was a poorly plotted novel with leaden dialogue and paper-thin character development. The storyline wasn't remotely plausible, and the ending was predictable."
1,Try Mother of God! Help!,"Perdue's attempt at fiction is not very good. From the blurb one gets the impression that he knows what he's talking about but he can't make it work. Catchy title, poorly written.This kind of stuff is formula written but the menu is missing here."
2,If a refund were possible,I was not excited at all by this book. At times it takes a few chapters to get wrapped up in the authors world but sadly that never happened for me while reading Daughter of God.Most recently I purchased The Da Vinci Code and I was plesantly surprised. Similar subject matter but gripping from the first page to the last. I would suggest purchasing Dan Brown's TDVC over Lewis Perdue's DOG.
1,Poorly Written Novel,"Daughter of God is one of the most poorly written books I have read in a long time. The plot was choppy, the characters unrealistic, the grammar confusing, and the thesis anti-religion. I did not find it intellectually stimulating due to the author's obviously overt efforts to bend his readers to a certain point of view through awkward conversations between his characters and through character developments throughout the plot. Such conversations and such developments would not take place in real life the way the author depicts them in his book. The ultimate problem is that his book becomes an awkward cross between a theological essay and a fictional novel - leaving the reader confused as to whether he or she should be trying to enjoy the plot or trying to seriously consider the thesis. And where were the editors?"
2,"facts, what facts?","This is a great premise, and the Sophia plot is convincingly presented, as far as it goes. Sadly, Perdue wants to be Thomas Gifford (The Assissini) without the homework. The number of errors in church history (not cover-up sort of stuff, just plain and simple goofs) is staggering. If you don't care about someone (mis)taking the real info and making a good yarn out of it, this is a fairly zippy read. If you want conspiracy based on good research, read Gifford."
1,CHEAP TRICK,"This is virtually the SAME book sold by Perdue under the title The Linz Testament. I have seen books where the cover states ""previously published under the title 'blah-blah'"" which is, at least, forthcoming - but not here. Since The Daughter of God contained no such declaration, I felt hoodwinked and taken advantage of - and robbed. Perdue renamed the main characters and added some new paragraphs, but most of the book is literally a xerox of the earlier publication. I've lost respect for this author. With each duplicate royalty he should feel ashamed. It's OK to get on the DaVinci bandwagon, but not by trying to scam us in this way. Be up front about republishing it."
4,A nice book,"This book is well written and researched, although it is not really a thriller like ""Da Vinci Code,"" I became bored several times. Also almost every character in the book is eventually dead, sometimes after speaking just a few words. Besides you will find a lot of unrealistic escapes. But if you like to read about philosophy and religion in an action-type book, you will oversee these shortcomings. There are not a lot of books of this kind, so I recommend it to everybody."
5,Glad I got This as a present,"A good friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday and I enjoyed it thoroughly and am planning to take a look at some of this author's other works.It worked for me as a thriller and it also worked to make me think about religion and faith.But most intriguing were the discussions between Zoe and Thalia where they talk about the concept of God gradually changed to a male-dominated deity. One of the most striking parts is the discussion of how the changeover from a hunter-gatherer culture to agriculture may have have been the cause. And ironically, women basically invented agriculture and caused the Goddess' downfall."
2,Not Very Good,"[...] I was very disappointed. Although I can appreciate the author's imagination and ideas, he is just not a good enough writer to turn his ideas into interesting reading. ""Daughter of God"" started with a great premise which promised an exciting thriller but the writing was just terrible, the situations were ridiculous, the characters were wooden, and the cliches were many. I kept with this book just hoping that the story would get better and live up to its promise. It didn't. If this subject matter sounds interesting you would be well advised to try ""Angels and Demons"" or ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown instead."
2,not as good as it could have been,"The premise of this book should have led to a stunning and gripping read. Imagine that there was a second Messiah born around the time of Constantine, that this Messiah was destroyed by collaboration of the Pope and Constantine, that this Messiah was a girl, and that the Catholic Church, KGB and the US NSA will all do anything to get hold of the documentation and shroud of this Messiah.Sounds like the start of a great thriller, and should have been. Unfortunately it isn't. The writer gets so caught up in giving unnecessary details that the reader is tempted to skim read to get through it. Do we really need over 15 different descriptions of what it looks like when someone's head is blown off? Of what it looks and smells like when someone is gutted by a knife or Uzi while still alive? Perdue put so much killing in this story, it seems he ran out of ways to describe them.Overall, the book was purely dissatisfying."
1,Worthless,"Mr. perdue may be a good journalist but he certainly can't write a thriller. The plot has potential but the result is even worse than Ludlum. Which is funny, because Perdue actually ridicules Ludlum's books at one point. If you want to read about a catholic conspiracy, there are a lot of better books around. If you want to read an intelligent thriller about a female messiah, try Glenn Kleiers ""The Last Day""."
2,"Compelling Story, Just Poorly Written","[...] This book is poorly written, and chock full of tired cliches (his favorite being the character who walks into the story, divulges a ton of information, and then is killed by an unseen assailant.) The dialogue is stilted and, at times, downright painful.This is too bad, because I liked the basis of the plot, and it appears that Perdue did a good amount of research. If only he had taken some of that time and invested it in a writing course..."
5,"Candied fruit, YUM!",Ordered this candied fruit andred cherries and pineapple fromthis vendor and was so pleasedwith everything. I have alreadyordered and received more fruitfrom them. We love fruitcakecookies all year round.Prices are very reasonable.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,I purchased this based solely on the reviews (highly unlike me) and I have to say I have not been disappointed with this product. I do not recommend using a lot of it at first. I suggest using a little bit at a time to learn your tolerance and avoid getting an upset stomach. If you are trying to use less sugar (or no sugar) give this a try.
4,Better than xylitol gum.,"Highly recommended for table sugar. I purchased xylitol gum for dental protection also. But I think that putting a quarter teaspoon xylitol into my mouth and holding it there reaches far higher molar/molal (pun intended) concentrations, far higher than using gum as the delivery method. 15 pounds seemed like maybe too much until it arrived, when it seemed like not enough after giving a pickle jar full to grandpa and grandma, a jam jar full to work, several jars full to the kids, and using for most sugar uses. Feels slightly different than sugar in the mouth, seems to get very slightly cold when dissolving, tastes every bit as good as table sugar, to me a little better."
1,horrible laxative effect,"Tastes pretty good, but I can't consume this in even the tiniest amounts without suffering terrible gastrointestinal upset (to put it politely). Erythritol, another calorie-free sugar alcohol, tastes great and doesn't cause me any problems; it is, however, pricy. I was excited when I did a search for erythritol, and this came up. It was a great deal - I thought. Of course, I didn't notice this is xylitol, not erythritol, so I had to send it back, at my expense. I would advise anyone considering this product to try a small bag first, to see if you tolerate it."
5,Incredible value,About a hundred times cheaper than buying the individual sinus packets. Excellent quality. Was going to get the indiv and this was a superb buy.
4,"Good product; but, large crystals","If Now Foods would only grind the Xylitol crystals smaller it would dissolve much quicker. I put some from this bulk bag in a natural, unsweetened peanut butter a month ago. The crystals are still there! If it was a powdered version, it would be even more useful by dissolving almost instantly. The only place Xylitol doesn't work is with yeasted breads. It interferes with the yeast when baking bread. The Xylitol is made from corn. Hard to find the original Birch tree Xylitol, although it is sold. Now Foods prices for the sweetener are some of the lowest I've found.Unfortunately, the small Now Foods pure Xylitol packets (75 per box) can't be torn, they have to be cut with scissors to open them. Also, the packets have so little xylitol in them, it is necessary to use a few packets; or buy the bulk bag above, which we prefer. For packets, we'll stick with the ""SOoo Sweet Stevia"" that Amazon also sells. It's the sweetest one of all and has no bitterness."
1,Untrue,"I am not a happy camper. This website says ""pure xylitol"". What did I get? A box of packets that say ""Xylitol Plus"" which is Xylitol and Stevia. And, most of the time, I find Stevia to be nasty. So now I likely have to throw this whole box away and I am pissed. This seller is not worth your time. Go to your local health food store where you can hold the box you want in your hands."
5,Great alternative,"Xylitol is a great alternative to regular sugar! I feel it's more sweet than sugar, but adjust your portions accordingly and it will be fine!"
2,Doesn't agree with my stomach!,"I love xylitol and usually use another brand, but that ran out of stock, so I got the Now Foods bag. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, this makes my innards rumble and more. I usually have it in about 3 glasses of tea a day. You might want to try a sample before committing."
3,"Packets are only 2 grams each, half the size of others.","Each packet contains only 2 grams of Xylitol. Others (e.g. Xlear) are 4 grams. Other than that, they appear to be the same - I just use 2 packets instead of one. Also, these packets have an inner plastic lining making them difficult to tear open with your fingers. Keep a scissors handy."
1,"Xylitol is great, but not this version","NOW xylitol is made in China from corn. It is a lesser quality xylitol and can lead to GI distress and bloating. I switched to higher quality xylitol from North American birch hardwood, and the intestinal issues went away.If xylitol gives you any digestive issues, try ""Xyla"" brand or any other made from birch hardwood, not corn."
4,"Good alternative to sugar, you can bake with it!","Ok, so it's not sugar, but it's pretty darn close, and all the newest research shows it is much better for you than sugar or artificial sweeteners. I used it to bake bluberry muffins. They came out fluffier than using white sugar, although a bit less sweet. I'll be back for more, and Amazon has a good price."
1,Chalky taste,"This xylitol in packets is very chalky in taste. I hate it! So far, I have bought Now, Epic and Natrazyle xylitol, and the Now has been the only one not worth buying again.Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
5,I LOVE XYLITOL,"I am not into sugar substitutes because of the potential health risks so when I use sugar it is sugar not a substitute, when I found out that this really was a natural thing I tried it and loved it. It looks like cane sugar, it tastes like cane sugar and it really sweetens twice as much (or more) as cane sugar. I have been using for a year now and are very happy. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Diabetics will love it."
2,Causes bloating and diarrhea in me.. Tastes great though.,"I thought I finally had my sugar substitute but after using an entire bag thinking my digestive system would eventually get used to it, never did... Every time I use even a small amount (teaspoon) I get gas pains, bloating and diarrhea and end up taking a bunch of probiotics to straighten my gut back into shape.It sure does taste good without any aftertaste, but for me, it's not worth it. I'd be curious if others have been able to rid their digestive issues and continue using the product.. I'd love to add this to my grocery list."
3,"Corn based, packaging sucks","The product itself is OK, corn based, but tastes alright. It's the packaging that really stinks. The packets are very hard to tear open, and I usually end up with the packet exploding and crystals going everywhere (because I'm too lazy to use scissors.) Be warned!"
3,Mainly for fans of Anime,"This is an excellent, enjoyable, and informative DVD. However, for someone who is not particularly a fan of Anime but is an aspiring voice actor, I thought that more of the nuts and bolts of the business of voice acting would have been most helpful, with less emphasis placed on Anime. Most, if not all, of the VAs on the disk are Anime actors. I also would have liked to see exploration of the audition process in greater detail. If you're interested in working in Anime, this DVD is a great choice; it's also worthwhile as part of the learning journey for any aspiring VAs, even with the emphasis on Anime."
1,This Book SUCKS!!!!!,"I read the first Black Fleet Crisis book, and it was Ok but this one was horrible. It was the worst book I have ever read! I hate the format especially. They divert,like 100 pages on the same person! The only reason I kept on reading it, was because it was part of a trilogy. If I were you, I would NOT get it, unless you really want to finish the trilogy.BORRRRRING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Author, characters killing time until sequel.","This is the book that made me say ""enough is enough"" and stop reading SW books. If ever a book was written to fulfill a contractual obligation, this is it. Kube obviously ran out of ideas, but had to come up with a ""middle book."" Thus we get Lando and Lobot goofing around in a ""living ship""--a plot stolen from a 1980 comic book (the one before Empire started.) Get this--they solve the puzzle of the ship by gazing into one of those ""Magic Eye"" posters you see at the mall. NO I AM NOT KIDDING! Read the first series again or get hooked on Kerouac or Vonnegut or something. Avoid this book."
2,"Predictable, prefabricated, no surprises","The Black Fleet books are a disappointment. They simply aren't anything as exciting as the Timothy Zahn trilogy. The story is a good one - a mysterious alien race bent on genocide. But the delivery is extremely predictable. Leia is dealing with political backstabbing, Han is learning how to live without smuggling, Chewie is protecting everyone, Luke is on some fool Jedia crusade and Lando is using his gambler's smarts to fool everybody. I could see each plot twist far before it came. There were no surprises, no risk and therefore no enjoyment in reading this."
2,It is just plain like a white sheet,"The author did little to keep you drawn to the tirilogy and continnues it in this book. It took me 3 months to finish it. Once you stop reading ther's little to make you want to go back and finiish. Also the ending was rush, two previous books iindicating a grand scale epidemic what a watse! I really don't ave any spectacular to write anout this. You doon't even really need to read cuuz the only infoo you might is thw Wookies put some modifications on Falcon. Also Han was out for the whole book!!"
3,"Details, Details... Details Abound","The level of detail in this book is great. It really gets you into the full stucture of the ""current"" Star Wars universe. The only thing that I could say against it is that it ends way too fast.Perhaps Mr. Kube-McDowell will make the next one longer because there is quite a large part left to tell."
1,Well...Uh...,"""Sheild of Lies"" should be in a garbage can, not a bookstore! A few months ago, I read ""Black Fleet Crisis"" book number one. It reeked too. The plot, if there is any, should only fill three pages, not three books. There was none of the action and good stuff here that I have come to expect from a ""Star Wars"" novel. All this book is, really, is the lengthly explanation of a boring government that doesn't even excist. It's downright stupid and boring if you ask me"
3,Suffers by Nature,"Here Kube-MacDowell tried to bind two parts of a trilogy together and, alas, failed in his venture. Far too much time is spent on the flaws, uninteresting 'Luke' and 'Lado' storylines and not enough on the 'Leia' storyline, which actually exhibits intelligence. While 'Before the Storm' had at least some interaction between storylines and lots of politics and military work, 'Shield of Lies' has absolutely no inter-story interaction. The 'Leia' storyline is still good (unless you thinkg Ewoks beating up stormies is cool) but doesn't get enough attention. The Battle of Doornik-319 is the best part of the book by far, and even then there are far better parts elsewhere in other books. It's hard to say if I reccomend the book or not, alas. 2/3 of it are a waste, but the other 1/3 is worth reading and connects well with the rest of the series. Decide for yourself after reading the 'Leia' segments of 'Before the Storm' if its worth the money."
1,Horrible. This if for the people who defend this trash,"This book is lousy. Its pointless and dragged out. If these 3 books were made into 1, it may be decent. But this 2nd book is just horrible.I seen one person say ""I am sorry that your limited intellect cannot stand plot development and intricate story lines""1st of all, plot development is suppose to lead to a plot right? NOTHING HAPPENS. Lando solves nothing in book 2, Luke figures out nothing in book 2. Nothing happens.2nd of all whats so intricate about a vessal that was made by a long lost race. Sure its in interesting ship, but it could have been wrapped up in about 50 pages. Not page after page, book after book.Oh No, a Hitler like character in Nil Spaar. Dont get too intricate on me. Boring story."
4,Better than the first,"Ok so this one started out a lot better. It continued with lando's adventure, which was a great start. The author had the book devided in three sections. THe first section starts with Lando, the next is Luke's story, and the Last deals with leia. Granted the storyline with luke is still awful and he still doesnt do Luke justice he did manage to pull off a decient leia. so all in all I would say better than the first but still not up there with star wars authors like Zahn."
1,lackluster,Worst of the series. Author spent too much time developing non-descript characters and less on the core characters we have come to love. Biggest disappointments were the vagabond Lando was chasing all over the universe and the search for Luke's mother. Leave this series on the shelf.
2,All talk and no action!!!! Isn't it supposed to be star WARS,"This was pretty much like the last one. there was no action in the other one it didn't bother me cause I thought he would make itup in this book.However he didn't. Another thing is the story of Luke and his mom I can see that's not going anywhere. What's up with shutting out Chewie and Falcon. Lando got shut out too in a mystery ship, no the plot isn't interesting. This is pretty much a book for SW politicians I can't wait to finish the trilogy so I never have to read from this author again.(I read every book)"
2,This was one of the worst book I read!,"Shield of lies is awful. the first half was okay but the last half was slow and boring. The people involved in the second half never did anything. They complained and threatened, but were never active. What the back cover says about Han doesn't happen until the end of the book. The first part of the book deserved 3 or 4 stars but the last part brought that down. If you haven't read the book, don't by it. if your iching to read it, get it at the library."
5,A well-illustrated catalogue,"If you are looking for more well-printed, decent-sized color images of Atkinson Grimshaw's work, you will find them here. This is a quality catalogue which has a brief, but pithy commentary on each painting. The paintings reproduced are thematically typical of Grimshaw's work, but there will probably be works among the group which are unfamiliar, since many have been in private collections. The artist's ability to evoke subtleties of atmosphere and light effects in a highly individual way is well-documented in this group of paintings.It is a slim volume, but worthwhile to someone scrounging around for additional material on Atkinson Grimshaw."
5,Wow...,"Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both shine brightly on this spectacular collaboration. If you love jazz-fusion guitar, this is a great album for you. One of my all time favorite jazz-fusion albums, ""Love Devotion Surrender"" will come close to actually knocking your socks off. With the addition of two bonus tracks, an already great album is even better. Enjoy!"
2,I must've been high,"I used to love this album when I was a kid, I listened to more jazz then but as an adult I realize now how incoherent the material on this album is. Mcglaughlin doesn't get the vibe of Santana's compositions and Mahavishnu plays too technical throughout Carlos's compositions. They're are a few shining moments, mostly Billy Cobham's. I would skip this album when putting your catalog together."
5,Guitar Bliss,"Buy it!If you are a guitar student or an expert ...see the two finest guitar players of the 1970's and maybe all time reach ""Nirvana""This is the guitar album to own!Listen to the tone of Carlos and Johnny Mac it is unbelievable!I strongly suggest purchase of this cd as well as Mahavishnu's "" Inner Mounting Flame "" own these two cd's and you will attend the finest guitar university known to man!"
4,sublime beyond belief,"This cd contains some of the most inspiring and electrifying music I have ever heard. Let Us Go into the House of the Lord is absolute perfection and is alone worth the price. It's beautiful, moving, and engenders a wonderful optimism. It's by far the single tune I've listened to most over the past three years or so. The Life Devine and Love Supreme are stellar as well. I like the bonus Love Supreme track better than the original. I give the cd only 4 stars as it's slightly uneven. Naima is quite ordinary (sorry Coltrane) and Mediation is very nice but somehow out of place. If you like this stuff, check out Flame-Sky on Santana's Welcome too, on which Johnny Mac appears. Also, the excellent Promise of a Fisherman on Santana's Barboletta is clearly influenced by these sessions."
4,Big enough for re-usable containers,"My kids bring their lunch to school everyday and this is the nicest lunch bag I have found. It is big enough to hold several plastic containers, but not huge. It has a nice strap to carry or to hang it up on a coat rack. It would be easier to clean if the outside were vinyl, but I just throw the lunch bags in the dishwasher every few months and they come out looking pretty good."
4,Christmas Delights: Quilts That Celebrate the Season,"New book, excellent condition. Patterns easy to follow if you do paper pieceing."
1,Sexist,"I quote from this book:""The instant we see a woman, we seem to have before us a being whose inward humanity is characterized, in contrast to our own male humanity and that of other men, by being essentially confused."" (p. 130)""Confusion is not a defect in woman, any more than it is a defect in man not to have wings."" (p. 130)""[I]t does not make sense to want woman to stop being ""substantially"" confused. This would amount to destroying the delight that woman is to man by virtue of her confused being."" (p. 130)""For by virtue of it [weakness], woman makes us happy and is happy in herself, is happy in feeling that she is weak."" (p. 135) [last 12 words in italics in the book]""Indeed, only a being inferior to man can radically affirm his basic being"" (p. 135)"
5,"The reader from Dallas, Texas","Before I read this book, I think that Java is something unreachable. But after I read this book, I feel Java is very powerful language. This book has great explanation and good concept. The book is for the people who want to begin study Java until the advance people. I read it almost every pages. I enjoy to follow the examples in the book. If I can give this book ten stars, I will do."
4,Good Java Learning Material,"A very good book about java, instead of going straight into Java. The book explains what is OOP and how Java is a OOP language. It tried to link the OOP concept with Java, in this way reader can easily understand.While others book in the market tends to link Java with web-design(applets) or jumping straight into Java features which tends to confuse reader.However, the book is a quite thick, so once reading and understood the concepts, reader can have the book in your book shelves for reference or to refresh the concepts.It facilitate and make life easier learning Java, Recommended.."
5,I got the book from my girl friend.,"It was my first experience with java . Patrick's book is is so nice to read and very simple to understand. I think I have started loving JAVA more than my girl. The book was very helpful in our project. Our college library doesn't have a copy of this book.So we would be grateful if you could send us a FREE copy so that I can donate it to the library. My address is JOBIN JOSEPH , 55/96,Computer Engg , Model Engineering College, BMC P.O ,EKM,KERALA,INDIA. pincode - 682021."
4,A GOOD REFERENCE,"Naughtons' book is well rounded. I was especially happy with the book because it had more than the fundamentals (which you can get from just about any Java book). The reason I purchased this particular book had to do with the fact that it had some relevant sample code for Networking that I was interested in.In addition to the chapter on networking, the book also summarizes many useful functions in what I call ""one liner's"" and the index is decent. This makes it a true reference book... which is just what I needed for a long term lesson in Java.:o)>Asher<"
5,Forbidden book as it is said..............,"Yes ,it was told that book was unpublished because its author was treathened , accordind to french author SERGE HUTIN in his ""invisible governants & secret societies"" /(j'ai lu 1971 pages 7&8) that book should be published in 1951 by the british editor WINGATE / with mysterious deaths and men-in-black acting to undo it / The sole explanation was R.GRAY has discovered the REAL rulers of the World were not ones we've been used to consider they are.the masters of puppets from R.HEINLEIN in fact...................The same ""adventure"" has occured with french occultit ST-YVES D'ALVEYDRE and his ""Mission de l'inde"" , threatened , obliged to destroy his manuscript once , and twice with german occupants.weird , isn't it ?? What was the problem ???"
1,Descent into Negative Self-indulgence,"What is humor? Hard to say, the Dilbert Future had it, this does not. What is funny to me about Dilbert is how he preceives and reacts to the disturbing intrusions of insanity into the workplace. Now there is no sanity left anywhere. Scott Adams appears to think that every person on the planet is too dumb to remember to breathe. . . .and that it is sooo funny to just now discover it. If you think that imagining that every single person who has a job is one of the leads in ""Dumb and Dumber,"" then you might like this, then again, maybe not. He seems to be quite taken with his own brilliance in seeing just how far beneath him all humanity is.This book is like a conversation with the most caustic egotist you've ever met. You know the one, every human is a banal fool--execpt himself. It isn't humor, its self-indulgence.I love books, but I threw this one in the trash."
1,Joe McCarthy Tactics of Baseless Accusations,"""Everyone's a WEASEL"". ""Everything your coworkers do that you don't agree with means they're a WEASEL."" ""If your boss doesn't agree with you, it means he's a WEASEL.""This is the worst Dilbert ever. Adams accuses everyone of having manipulative intentions. But Adams doesn't feel the need to prove anything. In truth, Adams is the one with the manipulative intentions. These tactics are the same tactics Joe McCarthy used in the 1950's when he accused everyone of being a communist. Baseless accusations, that play on people's fears of being called a 'Communist'. If you do read this book, substitute the word 'Communist', or 'Witch', or any negative label used in history, for the word 'Weasel'.This book is an endless litany of name calling and mean-spirited humor. You'll be none the smarter after having read it. ""Dilbert Principle"" is much better."
4,3.5/5 stars: Good but declining.,"Nowhere near the astronomic heights of ""The Dilbert Future"" or ""The Joy of Work"", and not even ""The Dilbert Principle"". As the ""Dilbert"" comic strip itself begins to decline (I hardly laugh at the new ones any more), it is still good to know that there are at least some good material left in Adams. Included here are some of his best recent comics, especially Wally taking a sick day (""The wavy pattern on the carpet is making me dizzy"").The chapter on women and the ""Glass Ceiling"" is a brilliant, shameless indictment of political correctness in the workplace - but that's about as deep as this goes. The rest of it is just anti-weasel babble that is hilarious but has been beaten into the ground.I still find this good enough to give three and a half stars, but Adams is defintely going down ""Dilbert""-wise."
2,Nothing new to say?,"After doing a pretty good to great job in The Dilbert Principle and The Dilbert Future and an ok job in Joy of Work Adams stumbles here with Way of the Weasel.The strips are as funny as ever, but you'll have seen them before in the strip compilations and the daily paper. The trouble is that where he had actual insight, philosphy and something to say in his previous books he doesn't here. We either have the same old saws about management cleverly called ""Management Weasels"" as if it were new insights or what comes down to prose versions of the strips. The actual strips themselves are better than the prose versions.The book does have its moments. But the start is fairly bad and you'll spend a lot of time thinking ""Why am I reading this.""However if you have missed his previous Dilbert prose offerings you probably will enjoy this. If you have read Principle, Future and Joy of Work then you can safely give this a pass. You've seen it before!"
5,Totally Funny,"Wow! This book is a riot. Worst of all, it accurately describes many places of employement!This is the second Scott Adams book I've read, and I would highly recommend it!"
4,Give the Nobel Prize to Scott Adams!,"As the workplace is getting increasingly weaselinfested Scott Adams should get the Nobel prizein economics!Seriously, what did Milton Friedman do for ourunderstanding of the economy that Adamshasn't been doing better?Scott Adams distills the behavior of people.People that weasels to get out of work,get more pay, or avoid responsibility.And fortunately his revelations are pretty hilarious.Simply, Scott Adams' ""Dilbert and the way of the Weasel"".is a terrific book about the Weasel zone.The place where our gross national product isgenerated....-Simon"
3,Dilbert is getting kind of old,"I have bought quite a few Dilbert books and seems like Scott Adams is running out materials. It is quite similar to all the other books, with the same kind of sacarstic tones and stories."
3,The Legend of the Petoskey Stone,"It's a pleasant book 3-4 stars. I ordered it 'New through Amazon in stock'. It arrived promptly and in new condition. With an actual Petosky stone that you can purchase through Ebay or an unpolished Petosky 'stone' with it's polishing kit (fine sandpaper, cloth...) through 'Heart of Michigan' store for around $8, it makes a pretty cool gift for a child anywhere from about 5 - 8 or age 10 at the most. In the back of the book it even tells how to polish a Petosky stone. It's a neat way to give an account of something indigenous to Michigan shoreline in particular, Petosky, Michigan."
1,book prolongs racism and repeats lies,"this book tells a white man's version of an Indian legend which simply does not exist. It prolongs the white mans view of history. It tells of a white man who marries an Indian Princess and becomes a chief. there are no Princesses in Indian culture and no chiefs either. and Indian women did not go into huts and give birth to a white man's son, whom he could name Petoskey. geez.Don't let your children read this book and continue the racist view of native americans."
5,Gatekeeper is a keeper!,"Phillip Shelby has to be one of the best writers of our day! His writing style is superb. I felt as if I knew Hollis Freemont personally at the end of the book. It is a rare gift for a writer to be able to bring so much life to each individual character within the confines of a book of less than 500 pages. Additionally, there were moments while reading when I felt as if I could hear the sounds, smell the aromas, and feel the winds blow as Shelby intricately described each setting. The book is a page turner from start to finish. The action rarely relents. The plot twists are very clever. A must read. I will be anxiously awaiting all of his future works."
2,ran out of gas...,"This was my first time to read a book by Shelby and I think he had woven a good plot,then all of sudden he ran out of ideas and he just killed the story which I think was very irresponsible of him.This is how you can murder a good storyline if you loose your motivation or whatever happened to the writer.I hope Shelby will come up with something better in the future.Don't waste your time reading this book.:)"
4,Excellent work from a female perspective in Fedual Japan,"I thought this was an excellent fantasy novel and have been looking for other books by this author. If you want a fantasy novel with a fresh perspective, this is the one."
4,A Decent Read,"All in all not a bad book. I'd love to see more books by this author, but to date have been unable to find any. Similar to ""Daughter of Empire"" by Raymond Feist & Jany Wurts."
3,nostalgia,"i first read this book in high school, and later on i kept thinking back to it, but it is no longer in print and i could not find it in bookstores. when i saw it on amazon, i was excited and ordered it. its a wonderful fantasy book, except i feel a little disappointed in the ending, but i do love the story before it leads into the end. it might just be a personal problem, i tend to not really like when authors wrap up everything so neatly."
4,Pretty cool,"Woah. This book is cool. Not especially for kids but its really cool. well written, formed pretty well. very good."
5,Be Like Jesus in communicating,"After their gospel sharing tour of the world Medefind and Lokkesomoe know something about communication. What is eye catching and thought provoking is their compare and contrast stories of the modern world and Jesus Christ. For Christians this book will give them a working model to communicate like Jesus. For non-Christians they offer the man Jesus as someone who understands what all the pop analysts, public relation firms, and political spinmeisters are trying to discover - the principles of effective even revolutionary communication."
3,Not As Thrilled,"I was not as pleased with this work as most of the other reviewers. The principles are good. Their seven principles are certainly needed for communicators in every arena.I certainly like the end of the chapter summaries that enabled the reader to ""Take it with you."" The principles are solid.However, I found the writing a bit odd. It felt as though they slipped into some false-voice ""storytelling"" mode. It just didn't feel like a natural flow to the chapters. The chapters were filled with illustration after illustration that seemed to distract more than help this reader's understanding. I felt the book could have been more powerful had they eliminated some of the illustrations.After wading through the storytelling, the principles are valuable and insightful. It just takes a little work to get through their style of ""storytelling"" and illustration to the meat of the book.I would, however, recommend it."
4,Solid Communication Principles; Great Stories; Slightly Misleading Title,"I was pretty excited to find a book about communication that linked its principles to Jesus Christ. First of all, the book is well worth reading. The Seven Principles aren't just communication principles however. (Attentiveness/Listening, Seeking Connection, Asking Questions, Authenticity, Storytelling, Solitude, Defining Success) I also found that the bulk of the book was not dedicated to the teachings of Jesus Christ. I did enjoy these stories but it makes the title of the book rather spurious and to quote the book un-Authentic. I feel most people would become better by implementing these principles into their lives."
4,great girl vocal,"If you like indi girl rock bands you will like this album. If you like Belly, Liz Phair, Veruca Salt, Cocteau Twins, and Blondie you WILL like this album... i would suggest playing this in your car on an easy day chilling with friends and passing a splif around... buy it, you will like it..."
1,All that was wrong with the internet,"can be seen in this book. The over-hype of ""just do it"". Don't bother over things like is there a viable ROI, just make them happen."
2,"Sloppy writing, and out of date material, with a few nuggets","I found reading this book to be laborious. I spent about 3 hours on it, and mostly spent my time highlighting the occasional nuggets of gold in the text, and ignoring the prose. It continously restates the same theme with slightly varied words, and the examples of powerhouse companies built on bizdev, are no longer applicable. I didn't find it worth the money, but did find a few items worth keeping. I would place this is the pile of books about the heydey of the internet, that no longer have any real world applicability."
4,Worth Reading,"I am an entrepreneur with a successful non-internet business. While I have had some experience with business development in the past, I found this book useful. Business development is an extremely valuable tool for any business. This is one of the only books available to provide insight into this important strategic area."
4,ONly if you have a brain,"This book was a fun and literary book. Not for the mind which needs consistency. The characters are basic, but the story is well-developed. This book is a quick, light, and intelligent read."
4,READ THIS BOOK!,Ella Minnow Pea ia a very timely political satire AND an uproariously funny children's story AND a biting social commentary AND a brilliant word game.
2,BLEH,"I had such high hopes for this cute little book. The concept is great, I thought the execution [was bad]. There wasn't a character that I wanted to sympathize with and I didn't care how it ended. I did finish it, but only because it was so short."
1,Pretentious Bore,"It's really stupid. The premise was so ridiculous, I figured it must have been, ""clever"" to get as high of a rating, and a prominently displayed review that said it was Orwellian, so I bought it. I hated it. Cookbooks are probably more engrossing than the cardboard characters. This book is a concept gimmick with just ONE interesting idea, that very quickly looses it's charm."
5,Again and again and again,"this book is cherishable. you, reader, can savor it again and again and again and each time you will be pleasantly enlightened by your new discoveries. it's a book of letters losing letters. it doesn't get much better than that. additionally, it's a totally unique idea. it's not a story you've head before, but it's one you'll want to hear again and again. Hence, the title for this review. get it. read it. become a believer in ella minnow pea."
4,Linguistic Brilliance,"This is a must-read for anyone who cherishes the lost art of letter-writing or anyone who has any wordplay inclinations whatsoever. Dunn has spun a tale that manages to be all of the following: a detective short story, a Scrabble game, a political fable, a love story, and even a futuristic Orwellian comedy. This playwright has mastered the ""man v.s. society"" theme in plays and has now translated his wisdom to the fiction world.... I hesitate to sing any more praises, lest I disclose the book's secret, which is precisely the heart of his lingusitic brilliance."
4,Relationships,"If you want to read a good book about realetionships then you should pick up Womanizers. Three friends Mike,Ahmad and Max. Two who were dogs(cheaters) to their women and One who was Mr.Right but his wife didn't realize what she had. This book has some drama that makes you say whoa. I recommend this book for purchase because I think we are going to be seeing a lot more of Dwayne Joseph. In A Dollar and A Dream this author writes a short story that was out of this world.Also if you enjoy Womanizers then pick up Love's Game by Harold Turley."
4,Saucy Book Club Discussion,"This is not the type of book I would normally read, but I was pleasantly surprised. I met the author who was quite genuine. After reading the synopsis it sparked my interest. From the beginning the story caught my attention. It was drama filled from the start to the end. I was also amazed at the author's ability to write from several character perspectives and genders. My question as I was reading was ""Do men really think like this?"" However, I definitely believe there was an element of realness in the book. The Womanizer's will have you flipping the pages; I'm glad the author decided to allow some of the men to have redeeming qualities. The Womanizers is a three dimensional look into relationships with all its ups, downs, hurts, pain, forgiveness and lessons from the male and female perspective. This book will definitely make for interesting and exciting book club discussion!"
3,Nice film but...,It's your average story about a family that loses everything after the father is killed. The family regroups and Jada has to deal with getting off of welfare and keeping her son away from the local street gang. She turns to the church for and help and a former prison inmate for support.My main issue with the film was that it was EDITED. The N word and profanity were bleeped out. You know something was said when the sound just drops. I would prefer the film not do that or just not include those questionable words in the first place.Otherwise than that the film was fine.
2,Sigh...,"This book makes many assumptions, not the least of which is an unflinching belief in conspiracy theories to explain history and ultimately, what Mr. Brooke believes are the end-times. His conspiracy views are wrapped in pious terminology, yet Brooke's ""hidden hand"" approach to history is slavish to John Birch ideology--perhaps even anti-Semitism. If you like Pat Roberson's ""New World Order"", you'll like this, too--which is no compliment!"
5,futon,"My daughter absolutely loves it, it was a bit difficult to put together but once all the labor was done it is perfect."
2,Wrong Item!,"The item I received was not the one depicted in the image. Furthermore, the screws and nuts must have been for a different frame. I had to purchase an additional 20 washers to make them work with the frame that I received. The assembly was not too difficult after I figured out that it was not my stupidity but the manufacturer's mistake that caused the problem. The instructions were also for a different frame."
2,Found the Biblical References Annoying and Trite,"Ms. Frank triggers in on the scant amount of information in the Bible to base her Egyptian/Isrealite saga of a woman thrust back into time during 'Ten Commandments' era Egypt. There is no historical validity to her assumption that this episode in the Bible took place during the reign of Egypt's only female pharoah. In fact, historians place the Exodus during the time of Ramses II. While interesting and integral to the story, I find Frank's bending of the facts felonious to the first rule of writing: make your story believable and indisputable. Sorry, but this one fails the initial test."
2,"Original, but not up to par","I am a huge fan of ancient Egyptian historical fiction, and maybe if I had not read so many excellent books in the genre, ""Reflections"" would have gone down easier. The book is not nearly as descriptive as Pauline Gedge or Wilbur Smith. Margaret George and Gedge do a far better job at characterization...""Who are these people?,"" I found myself asking throughout the novel. Some nice settings and original ideas, but Frank needs to work on her cardboard characters and repetitive delivery."
3,"Good story, poor editing","I really liked the interwoven story of past and present, the struggle with fully being where you are and the dream like confusion about ""how did I get here?"" Disappointed that the poor editing distracted me. Misspelled words and the curse of spell check that doesn't catch ""teem"" for ""teeth,"" for example."
2,Far from a classic,"Reflections has a good pace, and once in awhile there's a laugh-out-loud moment, but I couldn't warm up to the lead characters all that much. They were too busy snapping and gripping with each other and other people for me to care about them. For a better time-travel/romance, I highly recommend the Diana Gabaldon series. For an Ancient Egypt story, brave the bulk of Margaret George's 'Memoirs of Cleopatra'."
2,A Bad Imitation of Gabaldon---sorry folks!,"I love all types of Egypt books--good and good-bad. This one was a disappointment. Like the last reviewer, I was turned off by the Judeo-Christian element. This is a book about Egypt after all! Aside from Hatshesut being a bit of a nymphomaniac, the story was predictable, and not nearly enough detail was given in the ""rescue"" scenes--seemed like all of a sudden Chloe was safe again, and you don't know exactly how she got that way. Read Diana Gabaldon's books---same idea done with way more detail, excitement, and historical interest."
5,Read this book!,"I tried to put this book down--and FAILED!!!I read lots of books. Only one other has gripped me so. I was so captivated by this intriguing novel, I found myself saying, ""Just a few more pages,"" literally for hours.This first novel reads like one from a veteran. It's delightfully readable--even for someone who HAD no interest in time travel.Suzanne is a lovely person, as charming as her main character, and a gentle, disarming soul. She's made of the stuff that will sustain her through many novels--so much more the blessing for us.Renee Prindle-Jones, Host of Books in Review, CC Television, Fort Worth, Texas"
5,Really opened my eyes!,"I had read other ""flung back in time"" novels and, while I loved the Gabaldon series, figured with this one I would be just reading fluff. Boy, was I wrong. This book really made the Exodus vivid to me and made the Bible come alive. Getting vicious satisfaction out of crunching on the locusts, dealing with the Nile as blood, and the staffs turning into snakes! I was enthralled right from the start, and bought them for my mother, who loved it as well. I would recommend to anyone."
1,Zero stars is more like it....!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read! The storyline is promising, the beggining is somewhat engaging, but as the book progresses it becomes very stupid and predictable. The romance storyline is SOOOOOO badly written......!!! The author does have a good grasp (for all I know!) in Egyptian life, but it is about the only decent thing of this book. This is the only book I have actually thrown in the garbage...been embarrased to even sell it on my annual garage sale...."
2,"Far-fetched and simplistic, boring at times","When the lion ""Thief"" showed up, I lost all respect for the book. Please. It was also a bit strange on the religious front. I was offended somewhat by the author's portrayel of the whole thing, and I'm not even a super religious person.The writing was childish. No way in heaven is this in the league of Diana Gabaldon. Not even close. The relationship between RaEm and Cheftu is like comparing a match to an inferno with Jamie & Claire.I was disappointed. And even more disappointed when I picked up the next book only to find ""oh look, they've travelled to a new time now""... here we go all over again. Boring, yawn. The character development was not good enough. And the plot was not satisfying to the reader."
3,Different...,"This book was interesting but I'm an avid reader and didn't finish it. I don't know what happened but the story unraveled for me 3/4 of the way through. Compared to Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series...but doesn't EVEN compare."
4,Romantic and memorable,I found this book to be one of the more memorable books I have read. The romance is well written (although some of the historical points could be suspect). I enjoyed this book immensly and would like to see more of this author.
5,"Time Travel, History and Adventure!","I have read all three books in this series. They are so fresh and different than any time travel books I have ever read. All the characters are interesting, what happens in the books is interesting. There are twists and turns you never could imagine. Story-telling at it's best!"
5,"Very well researched,grabs the reader and holds them","I picked this book up on a whim at Sams Wholesale. I am fascinated by ancient Egypt and the detail Ms.Frank has in the book is just astonishing....almost as if she herself had been there.Her descriptions are so vivid you can actually picture the people and the places in your mind....and the imagery is beautiful.I know I for one would LOVE to meet Lord Cheftu,he sounds sooooo sexy!!!!!Anyway,I've already read her 2nd book and I am waiting anxiously for her 3rd book.This lady knows how to write and she has herself a fan!!!!"
2,nice but... no more than 2 miles!!,"they are nice, but full power, don't expect more than 2 miles (yes 2, no kidding and intensivly tested: same result as a 5w CB with a good car antenna!). to that, is nice to remember that they need license and license cost is around 50 bucks, so include this doing your math. the range claimed will probably happen in the middle of the rocky M. desert... I don't understand why the can't be a little bit more honest and, instead of writing ""results may vary"" write: works few miles range in town. Ashame!!!!"
4,Great little radios,These radios are really good for a director to communicate to the camera operators. The range as in all radios are really limited for a the Strawberry Festival in my town the range is limited to about 3/4 mile with buildings and structures in the way.
5,Midland Outfitter Series GXT650VP4 5-Watt 22-Channel GMRS,"Only used these radios this past hunting seasons;worked great;has all the features you need for quiet operation,(no beeps and silent alert);plus weather bands;the only thing I think I will do is get the better set of headphones;the ones that come with it are so-so;(takes some doing to get them adjusted to fit);Radios have low-med-high power that works great to save battery power;you easily get two days of standby time with a little talk time;and if you talk alot it will last all day.I would highly recommend this product."
3,Like the camo pattern and capabilities.,When it stays charged it workes great the battery like is minmal and once it dies it really goes.It does work fine new for hunting.
5,Extremely Happy,We just returned from a cruise and used these two way radios extensively on the cruise ship. We were extremely happy with the quality of the reception considering we were several floors away from each other. We had 4 radios in total and it allowed us to stay in constant contact with our group.
4,Vince,The clarity on these radios is very good. The range is obviously not the stated 18 miles in real conditions. I like having the rechargeable battery packs so I don't have to worry about having extra batteries on hand.I also like having the headsets that come with the radios so I can keep on fishing or hunting without having to hang on to a radio.
4,Work-man radio for those who need to be in touch,"Midland has done a pretty good job of putting this walkie-talkie together. Its a bit heavy but not overly so. My main complaint is that with the interference with other non-member squalkers. The frequency randomizer doesn't do so great a job of keeping others at bay.The NOAA notification system is a real boon for us outdoors men. The range is good though I have not fully tested it out to the claimed 18 miles. One of the best surprises is the long battery life. One full charge has you go to go for days as long as you are not overly chatty. Overall, its a nice radio that should give me years of service."
5,Lose Weight by Changing Behavior,"Ehrlich's book is precisely the medicine we all need: recognize overeating as another addictive behavior, no different from smoking, drinking, obsessiveness, or being a workaholic. My favorite line: ""if its not water, its food!"" Now that obesity is reaching epidemic proportions, changing our thinking, feeling and behavior about food is the only pathway to healthy living. I recommend this book to everyone who is serious about losing weight and keeping it off - it's a tough lesson in self-love, but so worth the results."
3,"The good points are great, ignore the extreme ones","I borrowed this book from my local library, I jotted down what I found to be helpful, good information and ignored the extreme behaviors such as weighing in 2x a day and vacationing with my scale! Then I brought the book back.She does make a lot of good points, and a lot of the advice does make sense. But it is the book of an obsessive person and I can't imagine living that way. I won't give up sandwiches, but I do put them down between bites and make a conscious effort to eat slower. I do not eat all my foods independently of each other. Some things were meant to go together.I don't tell people I am dieting. But I also don't consider black tea or coffee food.Use the book as a reference, pull out the parts that are helpful to you, and ignore the rest."
2,Too many unhealthy tips!,"I read this book, and although it is ""helpful"" in some ways, I found a lot of the information in there to be a bit obsessive. I mean, building a wall made out of salt and pepper between you and the bread basket? One of the ""Quantum Leaps"" is ""emergin hipbones and cheekbones""? Speaking as someone who has had anorexia for the last 15 years, I'd have to say that this book doesn't so much teach one to conquer their food addiction as it does teach one to become obsessed with avoiding food. I can't believe some of the things it suggests you do... A bit over the top in my opinion."
2,Pendant quality was poor,I bought this pendant as a gift for my daughter. Pendant was received in a timely manner. Very pretty but crystal fell out within weeks.
5,Excellent Book For Double Bass Drumming,"This is only one of two double bass drum books that I have ever even heard of. It is great for the drummer who wants to learn how to use double bass and develop basic techique and chops. The only downside to this book is that it only provides an elementary teaching of double bass drumming. Another book to check out which I haven't yet is the Encyclopedia to Double Bass or something like that. Anyway, the Complete Double Bass Drum Cookbook is a must-buy for aspiring drummers who wish to learn to play double bass."
1,Tattered Thesis,"Cumings is called a 'revisionist' historian. Well, as all history is revision, the label means little. It's better to say simply that in this book Cumings is wrong. His thesis about the beginnings of the Korean War - that it was a civil war started by the South - has been stripped bare for all to see since the destruction of the USSR and the subsequent opening of her archives. They show how South Korea was the victim of an international Communist hit squad organized by Kim Il Sung, Mao and Stalin. Visit the Cold War International History Project's collection about the Korean War to see how incorrect Cumings' revision was. Those who've positively reviewed this book don't know about this, don't care, or have an ideological axe to grind. Perhaps it's all three."
1,waste of cash,It's just 46 minutes of Angelica dancing. Lisa Ann is only in a bonus feature and all she dose is stand off too the side.
5,Must have book for health professionals,"I am a medical professional, and I wanted some guidance for resume and personal statement.One of my friend suggested this book. I really impressed by the content and advice given in this book.If you have any doubt regarding how to write a resume or personal statement, it can be your best guide."
4,Highly recommend this book for health care professional who seeking a job.,I feel that this book is very useful for foreign medical graduate who are applying for residency. These samples are very helpful for creating our own PS and CV.
2,"OK book, but does not worth buying","I bought this book to try and improve my personal statement for residency application. This book is straightforward, but it is too simple. You will not find any majic formulas or great examples. The examples that are there - are VERY VERY classic and long unappreciated by the RD's.I am sorry to tell this to the author but the usual ""I saw a physician saving little boy's life"" or ""I delivered clafs when I was 5 and that is why i want to become a OB/GYN"" are no longer working succesfully to get interview. If you need examples - surf the web and then WRITE YOUR OWN PS.ON a separate note: I thing I did agree with the author is that the use of the online automated services is probable not the best option to go thru, so the answer is (I think) better write your ow - even if it is not perfect - you can FEEL that the person wrote it, that it is not unpersonal"" statement."
3,Susanna Hoffs Collectable,"This is a good movie if your a Susanna Hoffs fan, and like movies about the real life grind trying to make it in the music world. Little did they know then, but 12 years later one of the actors would become the founding member of one of the most popular and greatest rock bands of the 1980s the Bangles."
4,Salamander Synergy - Wheels,"They work great. I would recommend them to people using the Salamander system, as these systems are heavy especially when loaded. But they only get 4 stars, because these wheels are just more expensive then they should be."
4,"They come black, ignore the picture- incorrect","Meh, we wanted silver, as per the amazon picture, to match what we have, and they came in black instead. Couldn't be bothered to return since we love the brand, and we are converting our units to wheels. These are Rey solid as it takes a lot of weight of not only the unit, but the ontents as well! Makes us moving the units easy! Happy to see Salamander available on amazon!"
5,Awesome album!,"I am an avid music listener (mostly rock) and this is a great album! I didn't really think I'd be able to really ""rock out"" to a Christian worship album, but this one is different. It has the quintescential Third Day rock and beat, and I can blast it in my car and have a great ride home from work! Every song is good and if I had the chance, I'd buy this one again. If you like Third Day, you'll definitely love this album."
5,Redefining Christian Music,"Mac Powell said that Christian Music is the only genre defined by it's lyrics. As a writer, musician, and singer it is beyond obvious that he has a heart for God and the talent to succeed in any genre he choose. Thank God he choose this one!This is one of few non-compliation CDs I have that I can just leave in my truck's CD player and listen to over and over. It is an intimate love affair with Christ shared with the listeners in a Godly manner."
1,have not received yet,i would like to receive it before i review it it's been over a month now. where is it?????
4,My fav Praise & Worship album,"Which is saying a lot since I'm not a big fan of that style. I go for the more personal & deep lyrical feel and most Praise & Worship albums lack any real personal feel to them. But Third Day has a different kind of Praise & Worship. The song ""Love Song"" at the end is one of my favs. The cover of ""These Thousand Hills"" is a really great tune. And I really enjoyed the cover of Bob Dylan's great Christian song, ""Saved."" This album to me has a much more personal feel than any other Praise album I've ever heard. Plus I really enjoy that Southern Rock style, in the vain of Hootie & The Blowfish & that band who sang that song about Alabama being a sweet home. If you like Southern rock, personal lyrics and love prasing the Lord, than this your album."
5,Get Up and Worship !,"Third Day just keeps cranking them out ...if you ain't a Christian you can still enjoy the music. I was lucky enough to have a copy a month before hand via import ( thanks Casper ;-) .) from Europe and when I played the CD out in public during a fund raiser folks stopped and listen ! It draws out the souls in search of something meaningful in life and this will raise your spirit to the sky. Hey ..it's better than the "" woe is me "" music that seems to be popular with the young folks ...get into something positive and listen to this CD and all of Third Days recordings !"
3,This CD is a 50/50 for me.,"Often we get a CD and love some of the songs but not too crazy about the others. That's how this one was.I was very happy with the seller. There was a mistake in the order, they apologized, quickly credited my account even shipping cost and sent me the correct CD! Thank you for your sincere honesty, much appreciated. Will remember to do business with you in the future as not all sellers on here even get back to you!"
5,A Different sounding Worship Album,"At the time this album was released there were tons of artists putting out the same sort of thing - praise and worship albums. As with any trend, certain offerings (no pun intended) rise to the top as the cream of the crop. Third Day's Offerings: A Worship Album is definitely one that rises to the top. I have found myself getting into the music and praising God on the highway on the way to work, in front of the computer, on the way to the grocery store and many other places. Isn't that what we're calling to do? We're called to pray without ceasing - singing praises to God is a way of prayer in mind as it's thanking Him for saving us. Listening to this cd will get your foot tapping and raise your spirits. It's worth every penny."
5,Customers greatly appreciate the Offering,"In most praise and worship albums you find most the songs to be very good and yet not grabbing you. Third Day's new album does just the opposite of this. As Mac Powell (lead singer) says it plainly ""I hope you came here expecting more then just a Third Day concert, cause we going to have church."" This is exactly what this album offers. A church service every day of the week. You can hear the compasionate lyrics that come out of the soungs that Third Day sings. You feel God moving this is what is so enriching on this album. Fans wanted more from Third Day and Third Day offered more then I believe fans had ever expected. This cd is a deffinate must for those who are Third Day fans and for those who like Praise and Worship this is the cd to have. Whatever status any person is Third Day fan or not this is a album that spans the every day christian praise and worship that everyone expects. This is a must and Third Day gave fans what they wanted and so much more."
5,WONDERFUL!,"I bought this CD just because i had heard that i was pretty cool. I started listening to it and it blew me away. God really works through these men, and the music is phenomenal!!"
5,"""Offerings"" is a gem","With their most recent album, Third Day earns a five star rating from me. I was far from disappointed when I bought it, although I hadn't listened to much of the cd beforehand. I loved, ""These Thousand Hills,"" as well as the rest of the cd."
3,wish it had more concert footage,"This is a pretty nice dvd. I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting WAY more concert footage from the reasonable doubt concert at radio city music hall last year, there are maybe 2 minutes total footage in this dvd. When I googled the dvd it was announced in a press release as ""Jay-z concert coming to dvd"" so I hope they will actually bring out the full concert soon. It was cool seeing the creation process for the album especially from the producers, wish there were more music videos included like dead presidents II."
5,Classic,I am happy Jay-Z took the time to document the making of his first album. It proves that he felt the music and truly had a story that he could recite with such passion.
1,Won't Buy This Product Again,"I was very disappointed when I received my Nikon EH-65 AC Adapter. When I opened it up, I found that the pieces were broken. I could not return it because my husband threw away the boxes. Therefore, I am now out about $35.00, and this is the last time I buy anything electronic through amazon. I never really contacted anyone about this because I have no boxes, and the warranty says that only the original owner with the receipt can return the product. I will never buy this product again."
2,Not What I Wanted,"This item was not what I expected; it doesnt charge the camera, all it does is make the camera turn on, but only if its plugged. I was also dissapointed with the camera (which was bought at a different store), because the battery had a very short life time (i used it once and it died same day)and when I put new batteries in it would say that the battery was exuashted or in other words dead. This is a very poor product from Nikon, which is a well respected brand of digital camera. The L18 worked great but it wouldn't fit into any life style due to its poor productivity."
3,Adapter,My son purchased this adapter to try and get a larger video game picture and better sound on our big screen tv. It worked a little but not great.
4,An Interesting Book,"This is an interesting story about anthropology and geochronology. I don't know much about the subject, but I am very enthusiastic. I am very attracted by this popular book."

2,It's almost great . . . but in the end it's just not.,"Don't succumb to the hype! Erickson is a skilled writer, but he is no Pynchon or DeLillo, at least not yet. This book is clever, and vastly ambitious, both in its subject and in its shear temporal scope . . . but it's often over-written and un-focused, with a self-conscious significance that feels forced and unnecessary. Erickson's writing is often provocative and daring, but just as often it's pretentious and obtuse; the characters are intriguing, but the story is so aloof from them that it remains unmoving. Erickson's constructed a good novel, but it's nowhere near as good as some people say it is. He's a promising writer, and you should read this book to see what he's up to -- but wait for the paperback version first. If you want intellectual writing about the postmodern world, read _Infinite Jest_ instead."
5,Luminous and unforgettable,"""The Sea Came in at Midnight"" is Erickson at his luminous best. Rotating Tokyo memory hotels, deluges of frozen time capsules, apocalypse, blackened satellite dishes, erotic terrorism... Erickson is a visionary writer whose work glints with intelligence and honesty. ""The Sea Came in at Midnight"" is easily one of the best novels of recent years."
4,"Ambitious, amazing scope","Erickson occasionally misses the mark in his latest novel, but it's only because he attempts moves most authors wouldn't even begin to imagine. The millennial theme isn't as prevalent as promotion would lead one to think; this goes far beyond it, and Erickson's astounding skill makes up for his occasional shortcomings in characterization."
3,Its a Pretty Good Book,"This book is about Henry who wants to get a job delivering papers. A funny part of the book is when is goes to apply for the paper route. On the way, he stops at a rummage sale where there is a box with four kittens for sale for 5 cents each. He buys them all and tries to hide them in his shirt when he applies for the paper route. When he knocks on the door of the man who hires people for the job, a dog is at the door. The dog growls at Henry and one of the kittens pops out of his shirt. He pushes the kitten down, and it scratches him. The whole thing is a fiasco and he is told to come back in a year or two when he is older. It you want to know more about other funny things that happen to Henry or if he gets the paper route, I recommend you read this book."
5,Insightful book for all of our life transitions,"While this charmingly written book is obviously written for CEOs and Boards of Directors, I found it to be highly relevant to other phases of life from high school graduation to being promoted.It is always difficult to plan for the future and planning for the future of leadership is especially difficult.From the best practices of business icons we can all learn a great deal about how to built a more lasting business, club, or school in addition to finding a happy approach to leaving something that has significant meaning.Enjoy the book and think broadly about its message, I did!"
1,Kalinda,It was my fault that I bought the book.I did not realise that it was written in a foreign language.At the price I thought I was getting a bargain.I should have realise that you only get what you pay for.The book is in good condition and delivered in good time.Thank you.
4,Not for beginners,"I picked this up because it's a lot cheaper than slide boards and am not disappointed. Learning to slide on the balls of your feet then drop your heels at the end takes a little practice, but it's not horribly difficult, and this is a very versatile form of exercise. I don't recommend it for beginners, however, because most people skip any instructional segments, and some of the moves in this DVD (sliding bridge, for instance) are all but guaranteed to result in injury if you're not wise. If you're experienced enough to know how to protect yourself, though, this program works nearly every muscle group and is adaptable to nearly any level. Even fairly advanced excercisers will find the pushup variations a challenge, and the control required really works your core. I like this one despite the fact that I just don't feel a connection with the instructor."
2,These are the Years that Should have Gone Missing,"Forget this rip-off on the ""Thorn Birds"" see the original and read the book it is based on. This mid-qual (not a sequal - not a prequal - but the years in between) was mis-conceived and badly cast. Other than Richard Chamberlin replaying the lusty priest Father Ralph - most of the other main characters are played by different actors (and unfortunately mis-cast) than the original. Amanda Donoghoe is especially grating as Meggy and Bryan Brown is very missed as Luke O'Neill, Meggy's one-time husband."
4,Thornbirds,"Really, a great series. I enjoyed it on TV and it is nice to have my own copy. I would have enjoyed closed captioning."
3,Thornbirds,"Always wanted to see this movie and am glad that I finally did. Good movie, well worth the price. Wish that I did not buy or watch ""the Missing Years"" - too many discrepancies as it was made well after the original, different actors, Richard aged since the first and looks so much older than he did at the end of part 4 of the original when he should have been younger..."
2,Thornbirds Video,The video is fair and the audio is quite poor. The content was and still is wonderful.Jeff
4,"Thorn Birds, so good to see again!","It was so good to see this mini-series again and all together with no commercials. I just loved getting caught up in the characters and the drama in their lives. BUT, I did not like The Missing Years, just leave The Thorn Birds alone!"
5,Forever Gold,"Forever gold! What a pleasure to relive the whole Thornbird saga all over again. Took me two days to finish, from the beginning to the end, could not stop. Picture and sound were excellent, just as I could remember it when it first ran on tv over 20 years ago. And at the price, it's a bargain! Go on, spoil yourself, and add the Thorn Birds Collector's Edition to your collection."
5,A Great Classic Mini Series!!!,"I have loved ""The Thornbirds"" since I saw it for the first time on television!!! It's a beautiful yet tragic love story I could watch over & over again!!! An All-Star cast & superb acting make this one of the finest series ever produced. I have had the VHS collection for years (which I am holding onto) but had to have the DVD set!!! It is a ""must have"" for any DVD collection!!!"
5,The greatest romantic mini-series of all time,"I watched it first time in 1985 since then it become my favirot miniseries i recommend it for all my friends they watched it & love'd it 2. Richard Chamberlain and Rachel Ward Both of them have done best I wouldn't change anything from the miniseries and I believe that everyone in it were excellent, I believe if anyone was played by a different person, it wouldn't completely satisfy us viewersIf you have never seen it before, I think it is well worth the time you'll invest in seeing it. But be sure to grab some tissues."
1,Disappointing,"Other reviews of this book had me really looking forward to reading it. Sadly, it did not live up to the hype. A real disservice to teaching and it made her students look like simpletons. It bordered on the ridiculous. Anyone who has taught predominantly low income students, or second language learners, or inner city students may feel marginally insulted by the implications made in this book and will definitely be rolling their eyes a time or ten each page. Anyone who has not worked with these sub groups may be impressed and will sadly think that this book exemplifies effective quality teaching."
3,Miss Chambers Takes Charge,"Claudia Chambers needs to leave her brother's household, as her sister-in-law's resentment of her makes life difficult. So Miss Chambers looks for a position and finds one as companion to the widowed Lady Rexford. Sweet, gentle Lady Rexford is a housekeeper who married her employer and is much resented by her nephew, the new Lord Rexford. Lady Rexford is apprehensive about dealing with her nephew. Miss Chambers begins her duties by making Lady Rexford over into a more formidable woman with sometimes hilarious results. Her own social life is less easily resolved, however. She has several suitors, one of which is Lord Rexford himself. Charming secondary characters, such as Lady Rexford, really make this one shine."
1,Almost unreadable,"Actually, it was unreadable. One of the worst regencies I have ever read. Claudia and Rexford were the main love interest. Rexford is homely and boring, and Claudia is just plain dull. It also does not make sense that the estate would have been left divided between the two parties. Entailed property can't be divided. And as Rexford had other places to live, why was he living there under such circumstances and living in the gate house? Illogical. I could barely get through the book."
2,green cherry,"The cherries are exactly what I need, however I received this item and the container was very sticky and the lid had some broken prongs,overall I was not completely happy."
3,Sterling & Garnet ring...,"Very nice ring, but why no size?I took the chance that it would fit, but even if it was the only size that was available, why not state what size it is?"
4,This book is genius,"I am writing my first book; and it's far more challenging than I ever thought it might be. Making it even more difficult: English is my second language. So I set out to look for copywriting tips and writing tips. By accident I came across this book and it is a real eye opener. After 20 years of english finally something that explains how-to structure sentences. How could my teachers miss this??In this book are 20 patterns laid out. Now I see these patterns everywhere. Just any book I open, authors all over seem to have a feast with these patterns. Sometimes it looks like a game, these patterns as the only thing that keeps these authors writing and interested in their own work. It's crazy. A real eye opener.The book could have more examples though. It has many, many very detailed; but as I'm a novice writer I need more. Much more."
4,Sentence Structure,"Two critical insights guide writing. First, the sentence is the basic input unit of written information. When we fail to place all relevant information in a single sentence, the reader utilizes additional effort to search and integrate information from multiple sentences. Second, we determine the function of words using word placement and rhythm. This book describes 20 examples of how to generate information dense sentences with useful word placement and rhythm. I have 2 criticisms. First, it would have been better to offer the reader a sequential multi-step algorithm for improving writing. This would have been easier to use than to repeately search each of the 20 methods for each sentence of a written document. Second, some of the methods are redundant and the presentation of information in the book could have been simplified."
4,Good Sentence Structure/Style Guide,"I purchased this book to better understand sentence structure and style. This is your basic sentence styling study book with lots of examples, even exercises and explains things fairly well. I'm sure there are more advanced books for sentence structure and styling but for the type of writing I'm doing it was very useful.Some of the styles I was already aware and had used, but the book explains in detail the differences and even shows how you can mix styles together. It also has excerpts of already published content to better explain and show clearer how those styles can be used. They also encourage you to mix around yourself and be creative.It's a good sentence structure/style book and worth the money, but if you want something more advanced this may not be what you want."
5,Creative sentence writing,This book offers students a way to create sentences that add interest and style to their writing. Even nonstudents can benefit from this book.
5,Honey Plants of North America,The book was in excellent condition and arrived in just a couple of days.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This book amazed me. I didn't think I could read a book about ""math"" but I was wrong. Because the math was woven into stories about this incredibly bizarre but totally admirable genius whose lifestyle was, to put it mildly, weird beyond belief. Schechter merges mathematical musings with an engrossing portrait of a truly remarkable spirit. Schechter writes wonderfully (sort of like Pinker) and explains everything with humor, anecdotes and whimsy (like Pinker, as well). I strongly recommend this book."
5,"Excellent! Engrossing, engaging, accessible tale of math","Schechter has done it again! I was eager to read his latest effort, having been delighted with his last book, The Path of No Resistance. In clear, elegant and witty prose, he has brought to life the European and mathematical world of Paul Erdos, and through careful biography and analysis has shed light on his fascinating, eccentric personality. The math in this book is remarkably clear; I finally understand the Monty Hall problem!!! I came away with a deepened understanding of the culture of Hungary and of mathematicians, and I was also moved by the book's compassionate portrayal of an unusual life dedicated to truth, beauty, and support of fellow mathematicians.If you at all are interested in math or history, read this book!!!"
5,Strongly recommended,"Though one could quibble about a few of the details, I think that this book is readable, and gives a *much* more accurate picture of Erdos than the Hoffman book. Neither Hoffman nor Schecter really knew Erdos personally, but Schecter obviously listened to lots of people who did! A very good treatment of a complex subject. Definitely the book that I would recommend to anyone who wants a good biography of Erdos."
5,The hidden magic of math,"Bruce Schechter's book is exceptional. In telling this fascinating story of the eccentric mathematician Paul Erdos, the author manages to convey the recent history of math and capture the magic of this unique art/science. Quite an accomplishment for a book that is so enjoyable to read!"
1,"D'Addario isn't what it used to be,","This is the first time in over 30 years that I have gotten bad product from D'Addario. It may have been the vender that sold it or just a bad batch of strings, but paying $75 a set for a set of strings containing a G that has surface cracks and cut marks over most the length of the string and a couple other strings that have similar issues to a lesser extent, is inexcusable. Whether a QC issue or the vendor just pawning off old or second level quality strings isn't the problem. It's that I can no longer trust D'Addario products. Not at the price point. I've been wanting to try other manufacturers for a long time but never had reason. Now I do. D'Addario quality. Sad."
1,Demanded my money back from the record store!,"This was probably the worst album I ever bought! I got it after reading an article about Kate in a bookstore publication. The lyrics and the music are fine, but this woman cannot sing to save her life! I don't doubt her musical pedigree, and loved the Dream Academy hit, but this was...wretched. Obviously this woman must have some musical talent...playing instruments..."
5,Glad I read this before I traveled!,"I had read the Hanging Out in Europe book and this was very similar only it concentrated on France. The places they mentioned to check out, whether clubs, restaurants, hotels, or museums were great. I had a great time and this book definately helped me find cool places to hang out. I saw a lot more than I probably would have, had I not read the book. Very informative, great for ages 18-30!!! I recently purchased the Hanging Out in Ireland book, as I find these books really helpful for the young adult crowd. One of the other reviewers did not leave a very positive review, I completely disagree with her."
2,not durable,the front wore out quickly because it was being dragged on the floor. as a kids shoe I would expect to last longer. had a hole in the top front within 3 weeks.
3,fringe science book,Book is the summary of the history of the electrostatic motors with timeline extending to ~1970.A lot of historic illustrations.Numerical data on electrostatic motors performance is nearly absent.Comparison with the classical electromotors is biased in favor of the electrostatic motors.No data on newer developments of cold-emission cathode and MEMS electrostatic motors.
1,Horrible Editing of a Masterpiece,"Although I was looking forward to reading ""The Castaways"", otherwise known as ""The Children of Captain Grant"", the beauty of the writing was disturbed by glaring errors. Hyphens and random symbols randomly intrude upon the narrative and dialogue alike. Sentences are cut in half and divided by several lines of blank space. To be honest, the book is published by a .com publishing company that failed to review and edit what could have been a wonderful rendition of an engaging story. It looks as though they downloaded the translation of the story without adjusting for changes in format or checking for errors. Shame on them. Although this particular novel is difficult to find in an English edition, do not waste your money. Let us put an end to cheap publishers demeaning good works. Do not purchase this version--search for another."
4,JULES VERNE CLASSIC,"While not one of Verne's most famous works, this is a great read and ties two of those greats (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and The Mysterious Island) neatly together."
3,Good for non-native teachers,"I was a bit disappointed with the ESL Miscellany. I found it to be overly simplistic, which may be a bonus to non-native English speakers who teach ESL, but for other readers it may be frustrating. The book does consist of many useful lists and groupings, but there is little to tie it together. This is definately not a 'one stop shopping' purchase for the ESL teacher, but rather a fill-in for groupings and lists that you do not have the time to compose for yourself."
3,Very mediocre,This book came with high praise and positive comments surrounding it. This is a very negative take on todays problems and he seems to offer no solutions.
5,The only real contender for Klemperer's,"Der Fliegende Hollander is the first great Opera by Wagner. Klemperer's famous recording has been fairly takenas reference for ages, however this Konwitschny's rendition could easily be placed as a match. Konwitschny's batonis masterly uncomparable in this performance, and the unique vocal staff of Fischer-Dieskau, Gottlob Frick and agreat Fritz Wunderlich is the second highlight. The result is a jewel. This is an essential for every Wagner Operacollection."
5,True spiritual musicianship,"Caravanserai is my favourite Santana album. Released in 1972, it's Santana's fourth. The album broke new ground and it is a truthful journey into music and spirit. Carlos plays his soul out on Song of the Wind and Future Primitive has masterful percussion with an eerie background. Also, the remastered edition has done a very good job making Caravanserai sound as it should. Shame albums don't come like this anymore."
5,caravanserai,"This the best Santana album ever, The frist i heard it to today it is still great. If like good music and something that you will fall in love with .It's too bad not all his albums are like this one . People call it jazz i call good . You heaar this ."
1,Made In China,"Wrench appears to function ok. I have owned I-R products in the past and have been pleased with them, all USA made. I wasn't aware this was a Chinese import and would not have purchased this product."
1,Avoid! Avoid!,"Someone at McGraw-Hill needs to be spanked.Man oh man, what was I thinking when I bought this god-awful book? Against my better judgment I did and now I am a very bitter fellow. Oh author how I resent thee.Believe you me, dear reader, you DO NOT want to waste your money on this crime against publishing, why? you ask. Here is why:- The author seems to have saved his knowledge of the underlying technology for a better occasion. He did not deem us worthy of it on this book.- All chapters are incredibly superficial.- Claims ""complete annotation of 802.16 specification"". Need I say that is, er, not true?- You can get --for free!-- documents on the web from the WiMax forum with more details and depth about the issue at hand.Being a non-engineer is not an excuse to waste your money this way.This is one of those cases when you end up frustrated because Amazon does not allow to give a book ZERO stars.That makes me even more bitter."
1,Handbook???,"This book calls itself ""handbook"". But it does not cover any details a handbook suppose to. Not remotely! A more appropriate title is probably ""overview""."
1,really really weak,"I bought this book based on previous reviews, most of them enthusiastic.This book is actually very weak. The technical part is confused and lacks of rigor, the business part is copied from the WiMAX Forum paper (or the WiMAX Forum writer copied the author of this book..). In addition, the entire book is full of repetitions and redundancies.I do not reccomend to buy it."
1,The book is a joke and a rip-off,"The book is very poor. The technical part is useless. The author is either totaly confused or he's doing this on purpose trying to bluff people and get their money. I really do not understand how McGraw Hill has accepted to publish such a ridiculous book, I beleive they should hire stronger technical advisers in the future!"
2,Superficial and Outdated,"This book is a superficial and disorganized overview of WiMAX technology. Just like the author's other WiMAX book (WiMAX in 50 pages), it is more of a WiMAX forum whitepaper rather than a thorough and well-thought out presentation on WiMAX.If you are a non-technical person that wants to read a one-sided & biased view of what WiMAX is, this is the book for you.If you would like a detailed technical discussion on WiMAX that is objective and discusses the strengths and weakness of the technology, then you may look elsewhere.Also, WiMAX is still evolving and a book published in 2005 is hopelessly outdated in 4 years."
2,Confusing book,I have the same opinion as jose-r.s. this book is terrible. The whole book seems to be out of order and the author should have read a bit more about WiMAX before taking the responsibility of writing a book about the topic. It is not my first disappointment with books from McGraw-Hill. When I see this publisher I just skip.
3,fun faxanadu,Game is pretty fun. Great music. Brings back a lot of childhood memories. Couldnt remember the title for the longest time.
5,one of the original 80's movie magic men..,"I have a 1'st addition from 1983 that I had Tom sign w/ photo of him signing sometime in 1984. I have read many times over since and would not sell for $1,000.00. he is a great artist .."
5,"If you want to learn about making gore, zombie, blood effects... get this book NOW!","This book is amazing and absolutely PERFECT if you want to learn about how to make amazing effects from your favorite horror films. Tom Savini explains all of his effects in wonderful detail, and his writing style is extremely inspiring. There is no shortage of detailed pictures, either! A must buy! You will NOT be dissapointed!This book was originally published as ""Bizarro"" in 1983, and is now being reprinted as ""Grande Illusions""."
3,Fables,"Fables are entertaining and interesting, reasonably easy to understand for the intermediate French student. Not being familiar with De La Fontaine I was hoping for a short story format, and was surprised to find all of the fables in verse (poetry). All in all, a good book."
3,Consolidated reviews are not helpful.,AMAZON...Consolidating reviews for different books is NOT HELPFUL. Without looking too closely I ordered the penguin classic thinking it was dual language based on reviews posted here. Not what I wanted.
2,Wish I would have purchased another,"I bought this a few years back (4, maybe?). I was looking for something to use to just trim and make less mess. The guard is not very well manufactured, and it creates a ""choppy"" look to my beard and burns. The vacuum inside gets about 50% of the hairs off my face, the rest are in the sink, on the side or on the floor...not much better than a regular trimmer. I can say that it still works like new, charge it only once every 3-4 uses, and the blades are still sharp. Probably been discontinued for the reasons I mentioned."
4,immersible heater,Use it to heat your coffee right in the cup when you don't want to walk all the way to the microwave. Just make sure you unplug it before you remove it from the liquid!
3,Raw,"This is as raw as it gets. If you need something cheep to heat liquids and you have no fear for your own safety, this is the product for you."
1,piece of garbage worked for 30 sec and that's it,"I can't believe I actually wasted my money on such a product. It doesn't even worth it to reship it to the seller. I don't know what to write about it. It just didn't work long enough to write something about it. Don't wast your money, this is my advice."
1,Immersion heater failure,"I ordered the immersion heater. I used it once and then it never worked again. The packaging was fine, but I decided that the shipping costs were not worth me sending a product back that was not very expensive to begin with. I will search for other vendors/suppliers as I am still interested in another immersion heater. I think they are wonderful products that can be used by a variety of professionals, from secretaries, teachers, nurses and so on."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"This is a really good immersion heater. Boils water in a mug in 4 min. I got it to replace a microwave oven to heat water. Problem is it is totally manual with no on off switch. You MUST put it in liquid, plug it in and unplug it when done. If you forget to unplug it (easy to do since it is totally silent) it will boil dry and burn out. I have had one for 2 months and it still works great. Cord id too stiff, so its a good thing that it has a hook to hold it to the mug!"
2,poorly designed,"I was aware of the need to always have it immersed while on, but it still died. The clip that keeps it on the rim of the cup/glass/beaker/etc. isn't strong enough and the cable's weight made it tilt to the side such that only 60-70% of the coil was immersed. Apparently that was enough to kill it. Also it isn't fully immersible which means that it only heats the top surface of the liquid--frequent stirring is required otherwise because convection currents cannot be established. I'd stay away from this."
1,worked twice!,"Worked fantastically twice, boiled really quickly then just stopped, whihc was a real shame, don't think i'll be getting another one."
2,Quit working after just minimal use but too much trouble and time use to return during the busy holiday season.,"I am 66 and when I was in my 20's and 30's everyone had these at the office or in their kitchens. It is quick, effieient, cools down immediately and is great for that ""middle of the night"" cup of tea. Only caution would be keep out of reach of children because it heats up IMMEDIATELY upon being plugged in (as it shoudl) so burns could easily happen. But other things in the kitchen need to have this same caution so I would not let that keep me from purchasing one.... just be smart on where you store it. Regards Patrice"
2,Too fragile,Followed directions and left the coil in the water before plugging in and unplugged and cooled before removing. The item lasted about 1 week of a cup a day before failing one day. Cheap mistake.
1,Don't Buy,"First, I waited so long for the the item to arrive that I was surprised when the package came. I had forgotten I ordered it.I used it three times successfully, to heat up water for afternoon tea at work. The fourth time, element did not work. Not at all worth the money."
2,easy to break,"I found out that even if you adhere to the directions, this unit can still fail easily. I used the unit to help boil water that was also heated with another heater and as it came to a vigorous boil the boiling around the Norpro was very evident... for about five seconds when it stopped. That was the end of the unit. So it's possible to kill this thing even if you keep it properly submerged in boiling water. Why is it so hard for someone to make a simple immersion heater that is reasonably robust?"
2,Poor quality,I purchased two of these (based on the previous reviews that I read) to take with me on a two week trip. I was able to use the first one exactly once. The second one made it through the remainder of the two week period and still works.
1,Stop working after the 3rd time,"The item stopped working after the third time it was used!!!! We purchased this unit to boil a cup of water while travling, the performance while it was working was very slow compared to the other unit we used to own."
3,Follow the instructions,"This is about as simple as heating technology gets. It's basically just a resistor which gives off heat. If it breaks, it's likely your fault because if it works the first time, the only thing that can break it is if you let part of it overheat by not following the directions. That said, there are dozens of improvements that could be made to make it easier to use, safer to use and to make it last longer. This is why I give it only 3 stars out of 5. It is basically the minimum necessary to get the job done."
3,It works so far,"This is the 2nd one I purchased, so far it works. The first one went dead when dropped to the bathroom floor, after only used about 5 times."
1,Product is a piece of Garbage,ZERO Rating. Don't purchase it. Inferior product. Made in China. It was a waste of money since it stopped working on day 1...! Threw it in the garbage rather than endure the hassel of sending it back.
2,Heater shorted out almost immediately,"I have ordered products from this vender previously, and have been completely satisfied with the products and service. This heater, however, must have been defective, because it shorted out within a few days of using it. I've already ordered another one,at my own expense, because it would cost more to send it back than the product is worth. Hoping this one lasts longer!"
5,works well--so far so good,"I was using a very old one that my mother had had but because I was unaware that the element must stay in the liquid when plugged in and unplugged, it burned out. Happily, this new one is working very well so far but I did buy two in case of accidental improper use. Enjoy using it for my evening tea time break at work--and was glad to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price."
1,Broke on the 3rd time I used it. Don't waste your money!,"I ignored the numerous one star reviewers' experiences and ordered one for my trip anyway, thinking that I can make some hot water for instant noodles or oat meals. It broken on the third time when I tried using it. It has never been immersed in the water beyond the point that it shouldn't be, but it still fail. What a ripoff, and what a disappointment! I learned my lesson."
3,"Good, but not too fast","If 6 or 7 minutes is fast enough, then you will like this immersion heater. I expected 1 cup to boil in just under 2 minutes since a typical hotpot (or microwave) can boil 2 cups in 2 minutes."
2,Water only - smells too,"Ibought this item thinking I could use it to heat soup at my desk at work without anyone knowing, instead of running downstairs to the microwave and being seen eating at my desk. (which isn't allowed)It didn't work. The first time I tried, within minutes I heard comments around me asking want stinks, saying it smelled like toast cooking. And, it was so hot, I couldn't just sit it in the plastic soup mug...I had to hold it.Be careful with this item. It works, but it is dangerous. I wouldn't leave it in the hands of anyone younger than 15 or they may end up burnt."
1,Worked Twice and Died,"Complete and utter waste of money. I made tea twice while on a trip and then it stopped functioning. I had one years ago that worked forever. This item was junk. Due to the low price it isn't even worth my time to return the faulty item. Don't waste your money or time on this item. Unfortunately, none of the immersion heaters on Amazon got good reviews. This one was better than most so I took a chance. I should have listened to the reviews because I didn't get lucky."
1,"Emphasis on the ""warming""","This product is great for slowly warming liquids. out of the box, following all instructions, this device heated a mug of water to around 130 Fahrenheit after about 25 minutes. I suppose this is useful if you want to keep a warm drink warm, but I was looking for something that could boil water. I should have known better, as the packaging says ""for warming liquids"" and not ""for making tea"" or ""boiling water"". alas, i'll return it and go back to the tried and tested way to boil water: fire."
1,Broke after first Cup of Tea,"This product was a piece of junk. I plugged it in for my first cup of tea and after that it no longer worked. I am not gonna trip over 5 bucks, but it's the principle of the thing."
3,a title,"The product worked as stated, but the plastic 'handle' that also holds the heater on the lip of the cup snapped off on the second use (substituted half of a clothespin held in place with a rubber band....). I can't really argue for the price. Shipped quickly."
1,Burns Out and Becomes a Hazard,"I would avoid this product. I have purchased this unit twice, both have burnt out after less than 20 uses. The second time the unit was more than 2/3rd immersed in the water. In addition, when it burns out it becomes an electrical hazard as you can feel the electricity pulsing through the water."
1,"First one broke, then replacement broke, too! Buyer beware.","This item worked worked the first time I plugged it in, and then it fizzled out. It's a cheaply made product, so I probably shouldn't be surprised. I must be a glutton for punishment, as I'm going to give it another shot and order a second one. Hopefully the second time will be the charm.UDPATE: Bought a second one, and the same thing happened. This time on the third use. And no, I'm not dry-heating these, nor am I plugging them into an outlet of the incorrect voltage. The metal has been immersed in water when they broke."
4,Buena solución,Una buena solución para calentar líquidos en la oficina... lo he utilizado en multiples ocasiones y sigue funcionando...
1,It only lasted about a month,I purchased this item because it was the least expensive; however it only lasted for about a month.
2,Could be a good product,"I used the heater one time and it did boil the water, however it fails to work thereafter. I simply called customer service and they promptly mailed another heater."
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID,"What can I say? I bought this to save money on hotel travel with my family. The first time I used it, it lasted 4 days and burned out. Two out of the last three times I used it I GOT AN ELECTRIC SHOCK! The plug on my unit had copper cabling coming out of both sides (the thin sides, not the flat sides.) So when you unplug it from a sideways wall outlet, you are likely to touch both copper cables and ZAP ZAP ZAP !! BIG SURPRISE !!!STAY AWAY !!! DO NOT BUY !!! COULD NOT BE WORSE !!!"
4,Great way to heat water quickly,NORDIC PRODUCTS 559 HEATER IMMERSION For warming liquidsThis product is great for traveling when you would like a hot beverage in a few minutes. It only requires an outlet and I use it in hotel rooms when I am on the road.
1,terrible product. piece of junk,"I read the reviews which said this wasn't very reliable unless you followed the directions closely. I following the directions exactly as required, and the thing still only lasted 4 days.what a piece of junk!!!!I want my money back on this one!!"
1,This thing literally worked for only one minute!!!,"The first few seconds of using this water heater were great. It worked as it was supposed to. Then literally seconds later, it just stopped heating up altogether. I didn't submerge the whole thing in water or anything like that; it just stopped working after one minute of use. Needless to say, I sent it back immediately and got a full refund. Hopefully, my experience with this product won't be yours, but BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
2,Two-week lifespan,"Like other reviewers, I used this immersion heater successfully for two weeks and then it stopped working. I followed the directions each time and was happy with the results until it died, peacefully, after ten times."
1,almost worthless,I liked it the first two times I used it. It didn't work the third time even though I made sure to always keep it immersed. Kind of expensive for two uses.
1,Burned & smelled up my 1st latte in less than 5 minutes,"Beware if you intend to use it with creamers, milk or any potentially sticky or sugary liquids!I unwrapped it and inserted it onto the top edge of my extra large latte, I was right in front of the ceramic mug of coffee for less than 5 minutes when I noticed it started to smell very burnt (like burned toast). I took out the heater and unplugged it while it smoked/smelled up the entire house. Yes, it got extremely hot! I had milk, coffee, and sugar creamer - maybe it was the sugar or milk that caused this? I immediately ran it under water because it looked like a crust (of milk? creamer?) was continuing to burn on it. I sipped my drink which tasted like it smelled so I threw it out. The heater is now ruined (very black, sticky & hardened crust) so I'm throwing it away. No sense in wasting time asking for a refund for $7 when I read other reviews advising customer service is worthless for this product."
2,Why do these immersion heaters go bad?,"Mine stopped working after a few times of use. Does anyone know why they go bad? - it seems like very simple engineering... I was heating coffee... not water, but not sure why the device would be affected by what was being heated..."
4,WORKS WELL WITH UNDERSTANDING,"Throughout the years, people have always complained thatImmersion Heaters, of this type,quickly Burn Out once the Liquid has been removed.What they fail to realize is that this is Intentional.Many fires would have been started if the Heater were left on toBurn Indefinitely in a Paper or Styrofoam Cup - without Liquid.Also, if it falls out of the cup onto the desk or counter.How many Cats are responsible for such an occurrence?Sure you have to Buy a New One, but it also forces you to bemore Careful & Vigilant.Otherwise, you'll have to use a Microwave for Heating."
1,Failed after 2 cups,"Worked great for two cups. On the third cup it failed. Not worth sending back. Oh well, cheaper to stop at Starbucks."
1,DOA,"This F-N China can't make anything right!!! Did Not Work, Not Even Ones. Broken out of the box. I think, China patented things that don't work. As long as it is cheap people will buy it. As long as it is cheap people will not bother to return it. What. A brilliant idea!"
1,Never worked,This immersion heater never heated up. Was faulty from the beginning. I just threw it way. Hope to find another that actually does work.
1,Immersion heater,"i used it twice and it worked great - the next time I tried to use it, it did not work at all. At that time I had thrown away the packaging so I am out of luck!"
1,A piece of junk.,This cup water heater was worthless the first time I tried to use it. The plastic cup holder broke off the first time I used it.I was going to try to hold it but the heating element never heated not even 1 degree. Thus no coffee in a Las Vegas hotel room until I dressed and went out to get it. worthless junk.Lewis Roy
1,Horrible,"It will burn out on you sooner or later. Not worth the money. Just buy a good thermos to keep your drinks warm instead, I don't understand why, but a good immersion heater seems to be completely beyond modern engineering :("
1,Save your money,Dead on arrival. Didn't even get to heat one cup of tea and break it all the ways mentioned in the other reviews.Given the other reviews I knew it was a risk for this inexpensive item.But no point in throwing money away. So my recommendation save your money and go buy a couple of coffees at Starbucks for the price of this thing.
3,question,Need to know what metal these coils are made of.NORPRO 559 Immersion Heater for Warming LiquidsThere is no statement in any of the listings.
2,Test before you use,Bought 3 of these for a DIY sous vide machine and only 1 ended up working. Can't return due to me having cut the cords off. Definitely test them out before you do anything with it. The one that does work seems to work well enough but 66% failure rate straight out of the box is pretty high
1,Total junk,Norpro Immersion heater was DEA - DEAD ON ARRIVAL. I did read the reviews warning me that most likely it will not work. I was warned. Now you are warned!!!
2,Great wile it works,"I used this tops 50 times, then it died. I had killed one before, by not paying atention to details( it overboiled the water below a safe level) so I took extra care not to kill the second one. I suspended it on a banana hanger, boiled only water, used timer in order not to forget about it, did not remove from water prior to unplugging. It still died. Would not buy again."
2,Broke after a few months,"I ""used to"" love this product! I use it in my office to heat water for tea, using it about 3-4 times per week for the last 4 months. One day, I accidentally left it hanging on the outside of my mug, rather than the inside in the water. Well, long story short it hasn't worked since.And because the product is such a simple piece of equipment (and the fact that I'm not an electrician), I'm unable to fix it.I will replace this with a better product, probably spend a bit more money and make an investment.Bottom line: You get what you paid for."
5,Love it!!!!,"I love this item! My friend and I each took one on our trip to Las Vegas. We had coffee and tea in our rooms every morning without the fuss or expense of getting dressed, going downstairs, paying a fortune for coffee after standing in line for twenty minutes. It worked really fast and was the best investment! I would highly recommend it."
3,"good service,bad product","break a couple time for 1st ,ask for refund,get 2nd at no charge...dare not to use it anymorehope merchandise better quality one(customer will pay more)"
4,An impressive example of adventure tourism,"I picked this book up off my public library's new book shelf without any prior knowledge of it, and I am glad I did. The author does not appear to be writing a book for the ages. She is merely telling her story, and it is fun reading. I felt I got a good sense of the adventure the author and her three colleagues (also women) were having. I was often amused or impressed and occasionally touched. I would recommend the book to a friend who is interested in traveling in that part of the world. As for me personally, the book was vivid enough to show me that I want no part of riding horses or camels across central Asia."
4,Wonderful read,"Normally I find travel books to be boring, but this one kept me very interested. I found it hard to put down. It was a very entertaining and educational read about an area of the world that is rarely ever talked about."
1,they kept the secrets,YAWN. no history. no insight into local cultures. no personal epiphanies. no drama. NOTHING. I didn't even finish the book. Read Peter Hopkirk if you are interested in this region.
1,Worst possible book on the subject,"With the subject itself being so misleading. To start with, this lady talks more about herself then the ""silk road"". Seems that she is under the impression that silk road is highway 69, one long stretch. When you read someone like Peter Hopkirk or Francis Woods, this book reads like attention demanding little girl's journal.I am trying to think if there is anything good about this book.... Maybe a few pictures are good. And that Countess crap is the (fermented) icing on (molded) cake!"

1,not good,The straps on both shoes broke the very first time worn. Spent the rest of the day at work wearing broken shoes.
3,"cute, but of questionable quality.","i saw the other reviews, but didn't believe it. for the most part the others are telling the truth. while these shoes are very cute in reality, they fit kind of wide, and the smaller mini strap broke after 2 months of light use."
3,Insight Clouded by Bitterness,"Gorenberg brings to the surface issues of great concern in our time: namely, religious fundamentalism, Middle East politics, and the Temple Mount. He raises legitimate concerns about the ill-placed fervor of some fundamentalists, but his bitter tone unnecessarily clouds his approach. He uses arrogant cynicism when compassion would be much more effective. The effect of his writing is to downplay the role of faith and truth in these issues. It seems that Gorenberg is riding the pendulum too far in an opposite direction."
5,The One Book To Read on Religion Violence & the Middle East,"Gershom Gorenberg's THE END OF DAYS is a stunning achievement. It concisely depicts how one small landmass in Jerusalem is ground zero for the end-times dreams and fears of three world religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. With eerie ease, Gorenberg brings people who think the world is about to end so close they seem like one's next door neighbors. He deftly portrays how American and Israeli politicians and religious leaders court the support of radical religious subgroups while ignoring how their actions fuel apocalyptic violence. No one has ever presented people awash with apocalyptic fever more credibly. Extremely well-written and absorbing, this book will be keenly appreciated by thoughtful and aware people throughout America and the Middle East. Brenda E. Brasher, Ph.D., Co-Chair, New Religious Movements Group, American Academy of Religion author of Godly Women: Fundamentalism and Female Power AND Give Me That Online Religion."
3,Laughably terrible,"I guess I just was hoping for this book to do more for me. Thanks to Berlitz, I now possess the ability to seduce spanish-speaking women at a second grade level, sweet."
4,great gift!,"I got itas a xmas present for my wife, she is an avid fan...she rated it 4 stars !!!( Living in the Past)"
3,once again not send the import version as advertised,"once again i was sent the non import version as advertised, buyers beware when you recieve the wrong versions and get the old us versions at a larger cost... bummer"
4,I'd like...,"...a collector's edition ,with a new booklet and two CD.In CD one the studio tracks in the best remastered edition possible.In CD two the complete Carnegie Hall concert.""Living in the past"" (double LP)is one of my favorite albums"
5,As eccletic as JT gets,"Living in the Past begins with ""Song for Jeffrey"", a song which would have made the album worth its price on itself. But it's followed by 20 other amazing songs, each uniquely mixing Celtic folk, psychedelic pop and hard rock with skill, energy and quality never again achieved since its release."
1,Buyer Beware NOT compatible with Windows Vista,"I have had this printer for 2 years with no problems and had been very happy with its performance. However, bought a new PC with windows vista and after countless hours wasted on line with HP, I now find out it does not print BORDERLESS as it is not compatible with WINDOWS VISTA. I'm angry that HP wasted my time and has not solved this issue. Do not BUY if you use Windows Vista."
2,"Great printer, but not with Vista.","I have had this printer for two or three years. I work as an fine arts photographer and part-time portraitist, and I recently ""upgraded"" to Vista. (Bought a new computer.) The software included with the new drivers for Vista is just horrible, and offers no control over the printer. My problems, like those of some other reviewers, include: paper jams, bad print quality, inability to match printer to monitor. None of this happened before with XP. I could solve this, I guess, by creating a dual boot-- but that's just more trouble, and I have no guarantee that it would work. I guess I'll start shopping again, but now for an HP. Maybe Canon or Epson."
1,Do not buy; does not work with Vista,HP has decided *not* to update the 8750 driver to support Vista. Borderless printing and color profiling do not work. They want me to purchase a new printer rather than providing support for the one I already have. This is corporate HP when it is worst. I cannot recommend HP to anyone.
2,Very Frustrating,"The 8700 prints a very nice page. But its quirks and inconsistencies doom it to one of the most frustration pieces of hi tech I've owned (and I work in an IT department).The source of much of the frustration comes from feeding the paper, a seemingly innocuous problem, I admit. But, I've never had a smooth paper feed since I got the printer. It's not a calibration issue, it seems to not know when paper is in, when it should feed it, and it grabs at the paper so quickly that crooked prints are inevitible.I wish I could write a good rec for this printer, but it's a high maintenance beauty not worth the frustration. Just get something that works and you'll save yourself hours of printer set up frustration in the course of your life. Considering there's so much competition, why bother with this product..."
3,Awkwardly worded but still interesting,"The art, in my person opinion, is rather ugly but it serves it's purpose. I did have a problem with the wording. It was often too technical and a bit awkward. The sentence structure was a bit odd. I guess the point of the writing style was to be different and not seem oversimplific. However it was not simple enough. A book like this should be simple and easy to understand. I also think there are some terms that should have been clarified or defined but they were not. I got the impression that this book was not aimed at beginners but more at intermediates who were familiar with some of the terminology. Don't get me wrong, the terminology was not that difficult to guess the meaning of, but it did detract from my enjoyment of the book. I am just not fond of this particular style of writing. Other people may like it. And the book has some valuable information.Mildly recommended."
3,How to Draw Faces,So far its a good product for the price I paid 2 bucks for it and use it to review my artwork and work on weaknesses that I might have.
4,Great!,"Great book of reference and inspiration! Not so much for learning to draw but for helping to better understand form, weight, and structure."
4,Twin City Slickers is a fun read!,"I could not put this book down! I finished it in about 2 days, and lost sleep because I couldn't stop reading! In addition to the great narrative about his experiences on the cattle drive, Ralph added quite a bit of history about the area. This book could sell you on trying a cattle drive for yourself."
3,Good Book,This is a good book if you want the basics on your cats' mind and how it may work sometimes. The possible reasons your cat does what it does. You may find out some things that you never knew before.Happy Reading!
2,Avoid this book!,"This book is almost useless! I wish the author took her own advice and actually ""got started"" with the training instruction. This book is filled with antedotes and the author blowing her own horn. The only reason this book did not receive one star is because it can be used to give the reader a few ideas of what clicker training can do. That's it. That's all this book is good for. I do not advise purchasing this book.BuyCat Training in 10 Minutesinstead. You won't regret it!"
1,Christmas In Yellowstone,"I was vrey disappointed in the cd i ordered. It was listed and advertised incorrectly. It was listed under Christmas in Yellowstone and instead I got Yellowstone Christmas something or other. I have been looking for Christmas in Yellowstone for years as it was an old favorite of mine, so I was very excited to see it on on Amazon. I triple checked that the title and the track list all matched up with what I was looking for and after listening to the samples of tracks, excitedly bought the cd. It arrived about two weeks later and instead of my beautiful cd, I got something that quite reminded me of a really bad highschool band. It was terrible! I was so upset beause I thought I'd found an awesome deal and instead I threw money down the drain. The other cd's listed were well over $30 and I'm not willling to risk it again. This was my first Amazon purchase and I doubt I'll ever buy from here in the future. I'm still on the lookout for the correct cd."
1,"""Do not pass go"" fantasy","I have enjoyed other books by same author.This one had a fantasy aspect that I could NOT get past.The H/H share a repeated fantasy of slave girl/ plantation owner.Seriously?Who could feel sexy/ fall in love when ""called from the fields"" by the plantation owner's son? Gross, and COMPLETELY insensitive to the plight of hundreds of thousands of women who were forced (literally or by situational coersion) to have sexual relations with their owners and others b/c they were slaves.Ms. Summers: Badly done.There are ways to write bondage/submission fantasies that are not so CLUELESS about the historical plight of women."
5,Tartan Terror Pack - Packed With Bloody-Good Entertainment.,"This international 3 disc combo from Palisades Tartan features 'Sheitan', a gut-grabbing French fright-fest starring Vincent Cassel (the delectable Monica Bellucci's real-life husband), and is a mass of demented energy infused with some creepy humor (and I`m not a big fan of horror/comedies, tho the comedy`s kept to a minimum) before all hell breaks loose over a weekend in the country. Next up is 'Slaughter Night', a Dutch slasher flick with a few new twists of murder and mayhem we don`t usually get to see in most American horror films, and some realistic special effects. Lastly, there`s 'Carved', an Asian horror entry based on a bit of folklore suffused with some great effects and a handful of genuinely WTF moments, altho it`s the weakest of the three films, IMHO. A great value for the bucks, especially if you get it from a second-tier seller on Amazon. Horror fans seeking something different should enjoy this set thoroughly."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"If you are expecting a detailed and in-depth look at what can make your daughter ""successful"", you will be disappointed. I found alot of the advice to be basic and the case stories were not helpful to me. I was not interested in the life stories of other women. I have since ordered other books regarding raising daughters and hope that they will be more substantive."
2,90% of the book isn't worth the time.,The first chapter says it all. You need not read beyond it because much of the rest of the book consists of poorly written descriptions of the women Rimm chose as her subjects. The accounts merely reiterate what we know by now.
2,Cheaply made,"Broke within the first week that I purchased it. The lid was raised and the screws pulled right out. Now it doesn't close properly. I still use it for storage and like the look of it, but it is cheaply built. Not worth the price."
5,"Reference for win32 common controls, messages, and macros","This book had all that it promised and more! It's a great book to learn common controls from, and as a reference it's extremely handy! I can't think of a day I haven't used this book."
1,What is wrong with this picture?,This book is one of the worst books I have ever read on API and common controls for Windows 95. The whole time the author parades through the book like he is some programming genius and you are some idiot who should not be learning to program in the first place. I found his technique not only insulting but extremely arrogant.I will never buy a book by this author again.
1,Over priced,I saw no change while using item is too pricey to not work. Cheaper to buy hair and nail vitamins.
1,Benefit,"Watch Out! This one has a problem with the disc pressing! It's not even Jethro Tull! Maybe once the record company realizes the mistake, they'll get replaced in a few weeks. The album itself, is one of their best (when you actually get it)."
3,Little to doubt,"3 1/2Exciting folk rock, though it would take a few more rounds for the progressive inclinations to kick in and solidify a unique voice."
4,Great stuff from Tull's heyday,Had this on Vinyl - dont know where it went. Remembered I really liked it and thought Tull were very clever and musical back in the day. Great to revisit on CD and dont know what the fuss is from some reviewers about the re-mastering. I have a decent stereo and it sounds plenty good to me.
5,Understated gem,"This elegant, subtle and sophisticated album somehow avoided the hype of other releases of the time and clearly avoided the bombast of later Tull releases. This is early Tull (I believe this to be their their third album) but there is an inflection point here which would characterize later works. Benefit is where Ian Anderson finally discovered his ""voice"". This is a personal favorite of mine; the songwriting is wondrous, the album's production values are advanced, especially for 1970, the combinbation of Martin Barre's Les Paul crunch with Ian's acoustic strumming makes for a delightful contrast. Also, the flute arrangements fit nicely within the fabric of the songs, moreso than with previous releases. There seems to be a wonderful logic to the arrangement of the songs as they nicely complement each other. Personal favorites, With you there to help me, Nothing to say, Sossity (absolutely magnificent!), Time for everything and, of course, Teacher."
5,a beautiful album,"The third effort by one of the foremost progressive bands to first take hold of the most interesting music coming out of England at that time. Hints of Sgt. pepper and piper at the gates and a more definitive statement than ""Stand Up"" witch is also brilliant ! But this effort sadly the last with original bassist Glen Corneck who was dumped by Ian @ JFK on christmass eve 1970. His ability as a musician is a major force in the original inception of the band. His long hair and head band was just as trade mark as Ians, maybe thats why the dumping. Guitarist Martin Baree sounds like eric clapton on acid in a good way! Old school friend John Evans joined the band and also made an impact. But the true master Ian Anderson dazzles the senses with his brilliant and intelligent writing and singing of this masterful album!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,My favorite Tull!,"Like other Tull albums, this is not like any other Tull album. (?) If you know Tull, that makes sense. This one happens to be my favorite."
5,jethro tull NOT trying too hard,"I've always considered this to be one of the better Jethro Tull recordings simply because they aren't trying too hard to sound like something in particular (Songs from the Wood) or get out some sort of cryptic deep message (Thick as A Brick or Passion Play). It also features a particularly talented line-up of Tull, which, for various reasons, was ill-fated (as were nearly all line-ups of Jethro Tull!). Its really some of Martin Barre'sbest (the solo on Too Cry You A Song; the background guitar on Jeffrey,Michael Collins and Me)So, if you want Tull after they stopped listening to Roland Kirk, but before they started listening to Martin Carthy, get this album."
4,For Your Benefit,"1970's Benefit strongly follows up 1968's Stand Up with more solid music from rock's minstrels. Ian Anderson has his strongest vocal effort to date and the band is in fine form on such standout songs like ""To Cry Your Song"", For Michael Collins, Jeffrey & Me"" and ""Nothing To Say"". The best song on the album is the propulsive ""Teacher"" that ranks among the band's best songs. The album was their breakout in the US peaking at number eleven on the charts."
5,My Real Friend...,"Benefit,my real friend.This beatiful album always shares my feelings(cry or laugh).Now I`m 21 years old but I know,Benefit will walk beside me another 21 year and more.Every song has different memories for me because they are so beautiful.Please listen this album very carefully.Regards. (Note:I`m sorry about my English.)"
2,"They added a new song, good thing it is the only one I liked.","This remaster has only one good song ""teacher"" witch was not on the origonal LP. why do they do that?"
3,NEW REMASTERED BENEFIT BLOWS,"I HATE this new Benefit Remaster -- it [stinks] big time. They castrated this recording, all the rough edges (i.e. Rock) have been ""polished"" off -- especially the guitar riffs!For perspective, I LOVE this album, it's one of my 3 favorite Tull albums; I purchased it when it first appeared in the US. Obviously, (in lieu of his recent folkie sound) Ian is trying to ""reinvent"" the past, making his back catalog easier listening for his Prog/Folkie fans. I liked the hard rock sound of Stand Up, Benefit and Aqualung and lost respect/interest in Tull when he went the ""concept"" route, with far less success than The Who and the Pretty Things.Don't sell your old CD, like I did, before you listen to this sell out. I was going to purchase the Remastered Stand Up, but now that I know better -- forget it!"
4,One of their (2) finest....,"...along with ""Stand Up""...won't say much here; ""Stand Up"" is probably more consistent top to bottom (less throw outs or pass overs) but over the years I've become almost mezmerized by the ""sound"" on this album...It has such a depressing, melancholy, feel to it...with at least (5) classic numbers contained along with one of my favorite lines...""that was the best cup of coffee I ever had""...a true classic that's sometimes hard to listen to because it brings back so many good memories..."
4,A little disappointed,"I am a little disappointed with this item. I bought this to replace my Dad's old benefit cd that I lost, and this one is very different from the original. While it has many new tracks, a lot of the old classics have been redone. The tracks are also not in the original order. If you are looking to buy Benefit, don't buy this new cd, find the original somewhere. But this one is still good if you like Tull."
5,That was the best cup of coffee I ever had!,"The best of the bluesy Jethro Tull years and sadly the last one with the great Glenn Cornick on bass, apparently he was the partyer of thetee-totalling early to bed band at the time. These 10 songs allow Martin to really crank his Les Paul and Marshall to 11 as he does on ""nothing to say"", ""cry you a song"" and ""son"" and of course the hit single ""teacher"". according to rumor the Jeffrey in ""For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me"" is Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, the next bass player waiting in the wings. John Evan makes an uncredited appearance here and is great as ever on the Hammond organ and Piano. I particularly like the song ""Inside"", it really makes you want to grab a cup of coffee and enjoy this album with a friend on ""the inside"""
1,GO SLOW PARTS.,Stay away. i ordered a bug guard for my dad's truck for Christmas present on December 10th and they still haven't even shipped it yet. Change the name from GO FAST PARTS to GO AS SLOW AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE PARTS. OR IT WILL NEVER GET THERE PARTS. I think it could of gotten here faster on horseback. I will never order anything from them again. only gave it ONE STAR because I amazon makes you give at least one. Minus stars as far as Im concerned.
1,Disappointing product.,"This product was not up to par. The colors were dark and garish, not at all as the photo would lead one to believe. Also there was a terrible chemical odor that would smell up your entire home."
1,This curtain is TOXIC!,"Do NOT buy this curtain! It stinks. I mean, it LITERALLY stinks. Of what smells like very toxic chemicals. Google ""vinyl shower curtain chemicals"" (or something similar) in order to find out more. I threw this curtain away after a few days."
2,"His worst solo album, but not awful","Great cover of ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" and a super reworking of The Byrds ""Lover of the Bayou"" but the reggae beat of ""Lisa"" and the schlock of ""Born to Rock-n-Roll"" bring this record down.(Though this version of Born to Rock-Roll is superior to the version on The Byrds reunion album of 1973).In my opinion his best solo albums are ""Roger Mcguinn"" ""Cardiff Rose"" ""Back from Rio"" ""Live from Mars"" and ""Limited Edition""."
3,Such a weird smell....,"While the flavor is great, there is a strong smell attached to both opened and unopened bags of this candy. For lack of a better phrase, it smells highly acidic, almost like cat urine."
4,A wonderful liquorice,I bought this yesterday at Target for I believe $2.50 for one bag. I've never seen a mango flavored liquorice before. I like it. It is a little bit harder than another Australian liquorice I bought at Target before that may have been made by the same company. That's why I'm giving 4 stars. It is a lot of liquorice for the price and imported at well. The fact that it is imported was another reason I bought it. A bag could easily be shared among two people. Flavor is light but true like eating real mango. The flavor also sticks around for a little while after you've swallowed. The total fat is 1g. The sugar is 16g. Quite a delicious and cheap snack/candy!
2,Would not reorder,"I also ordered the black liquorice and absolutely loved it. But the mango didn't have that much flavor. I would try one of the other flavors, but not reorder this one. I gave away a bag to a friend and she passed it on to a co-worker because she was not impressed."
2,just okay,"Mild flavor. Usually a soft liquorice, this flavor was harder to chew. Perhaps it was a bit stale. Okay if you want a change of pace. I would endorse the standard strawberry flavor. A very good brand otherwise."
3,only if you like mango syrup,"The texture is great and I suppose if you like mango syrup you would like these too. Taste exactly like it. A little too sweet for my taste. The chocolate covered black liquorice is one I usually get, and those are awesome. But they ran out so I decided to give the mango and green apple a try."
5,"Excellent, Easy to understand booklet on Christianity basics","From the novice to the seasoned Christian believer, or to anyone interested in the answers the Christian faith has to give concerning the timeless and contemporary questions humanity asks, this consice book delivers. Theological truths are approached in a simple question/answer format -which is very clear, short, simple and understandable to all. This, in itself, is no small accomplishment. All answers are Bible based, from the Protestant precpective, allowing the Bible to speak for itself. The book design: paper, graphics, and layout is of very high quality. For its brevity and size this book packs a powerful punch. I very highly recommend it for any age group, for both Christians and truth seekers alike."
5,Would buy again from seller,Book arrived quickly and in condition as promised. Would buy from this seller again without hesitation.
4,Somebody's Really Done It this time,"Annie's got a great idea to promote Broward Rock's resident mystery writer Emma Clyde's new book ""Whodunit"" with a contest: a scavenger hunt through clues of mystery books and authors. Soon her promotion turns deadly, as someone forges her flyers and substitutes accusations and innuendos against her neighbors while offering a $1000 reward. As Annie races desparately back and forth across the island to dispute the false flyers, real murder raises its ugly head. The body count grows, Annie and her friends realize that this is no April Fool's joke, but the plot of a cunning and dangerous murderer. Will they fool the murderer first or be made fools by their wily opponent?"
2,Mildly amusing.,"I've ready most, if not all of this series, and this is by far the worst. The writing is now formulaic. Max is sexy as hell, and lazy, and Annie Darling is just....well, darling. Outside of that, the only thing that happens is a convoluted plot, lots of references to other writers, and some good puzzles for the mysterioso. But if you spend much money or time on this little piece of fluff, you deserve the final words in the novel: ""April Fool."""
1,Very Disappointing,"Plot, characters...everything just seemed too forced and contrived. I was half way through the book before a murder actually happened. Most of the book was concerned about those damn flyers-which was just the weakest plot line ever. The author tried way too hard and way too many times to show how much in love Annie and Max were. And then she had all these supposed ""quirky"" characters just rambling on and on. I skipped through the last few pages to discover who the actual murderer was and I was not impressed. Not one of C. Hart's best."
1,I didn't Like Anything about this Book.,"I just simply could not ""get into this book."" I tried for a very long time, but it just would not capture my imagination, warm my heart, nor instill any thought that I should want to even finish this book. Sorry, there are so many better books out there than to try to very hard and exert so much effort for not."
2,shoddy job,"i am sick of DVDS that fail to exploit their potential as a superior format. This one is just plain poor.I don't have the VHS to compare it to, but I don't believe it can be worse than this DVD version.The film itself is damned good... engrossing and great fun. It is extremely well contructed; somthing an audience may fail to analyse as such, but nevertheless appreciates greatly.All the more reason to be furios at these fools who care so little about their product. You can always hope that someday a better visual and audio presentation of this classic western will be made available."
5,A Great Read,This book taught me more about the topic than anything else I ever read. It is well written and very informative and doesn't use any jargon. This is a very ideological topic but the book avoids that trap and informs. It doesn't preach to the reader. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the topic.
2,Disappointing,I thought this was a high quality product because of the 600 Thread cotton count but these pillow cases are not soft even after several washes. To make it worse these are already getting those little lint balls on it's surface.
5,A superb and practical self-help book sure to fully engage the attention of any reader familiar with football terms.,"Written by Steven Shiendling, Ph.D., Fumbles, Field Goals, and the Myth of the Hail Mary: Helping Men Become Better Relationship Partners is a relationship self-help guide written especially for men. Drawing heavily upon football metaphors in order to effectively communicate its points to guys everywhere, Fumbles, Field Goals, and the Myth of the Hail Mary covers everything from improving personal communication from learning how to take a ""time out"" when emotions such as anger may provoke a person to say or do things they would regret, to the parallels between a successful relationship and a positive team, and much more. A superb and practical self-help book sure to fully engage the attention of any reader familiar with football terms."
5,A journey through Afghanistan,"This book is really great. I loved travelling with Peregrine Hodson (figuratively) as he walked the walk through Afghanistan. He describes the people and landscape very poignantly. We see the war with Russia from their eyes. If you want to understand the mindset of typical Afghans, as they fight to defend their country, and struggle to survive a war they don't understand, this book is very helpful."
3,Under a Sickle Moon: A Journey Through Afghanistan,If you are looking for a war story then this is not the book.
1,PIECE OF SH*T,i BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON FOR X-MAS HERE WE ARE 2 MONTHS LATER AND THE DVD'S WILL NOT LOAD ANYMORE AND TOYS R US HAS A 45 DAY RETURN POLICY SO IF YOU WANT TO SPEND A 100 DOLLERS ON SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST YOU TWO MONTHS BE MY GUEST
1,BRING BACK CONGO MAN!!,"The original album's cover has Billy in an '80s Oriental shirt, and the last song was ""Congo Man"". Bring those elements back, and I shall grant this album 5 stars. Until then, I don't care how many times you remaster it, it's still being used as a tool to sell ""Dancing with Myself"", which stains the beautiful vibe of this album. Is there any guitar work on this planet that can match ""Shooting Stars""? Billy, there ARE actually fans of ""Congo Man"" out here, and I'll even go so far to say it's ""part 1"" of ""The Dead Next Door"". I'm WAY beyond fed-up with the ""attention shoppers"" attitude of Billy's marketing dept., mostly because it puts us true fans in the back seat."
3,The Idol Worship Starts Here,"This album, his first full solo effort (with the exception of ""Dancing With Myself""), lays the groundwork for the hits that would come later from the ""Rebel Yell"" album, and is in no way a poor album, but it hasn't aged very well.Chrysalis had released ""Dancing With Myself"" on the ""Don't Stop"" single, and it got tremendous club play, and rightfully so, because it's a killer dance tune, even to this very day. The rest of the album is fair-to-middling pop gruel, the stand-out tunes being ""Shooting Stars"", ""Hot in the City"" (with it's motown-derived feel), and ""White Wedding"" (which got more mileage out of it's video than the song itself).The rest of the album contains some amusing soul-posturing; the production levels aren't what they will become in later albums, and Steve Stevens isn't given much room to rip his enviable riffs out, but that changes when Rebel Yell gets released, and the world is much better for it."
4,Great album from the best artist of the '80s,"Although there aren't as many good tracks as on ""rebel yell"" this is a great album. ""White Wedding"" and ""dancing with myself"" are classics, and ""Hole in the wall"", ""Nobody's Business"" and ""Love calling"" are also excellent songs. ""Hot in the city"", ""dead on arrival"", and ""Come On Come On"" aren't too inspired, but they aren't bad. Highly reccommended."
5,Classic his personal best.,If you had to pick one CD for your Billy Idol collection this would be on the top of my list followed by Devils Playground. Those 2 Cd's are Idol classics. I would put Rebel Yell up near these 2 as well. His other Cd's are very forgettable.
3,Idol by Billy Idol,"I purchased this album just for the one cut, ""White Wedding."" Probably not a popular choice for an album and your money may be better spent on the ""Greatest Hits"" album."
4,Goodie,"Possibly the very Billy Idol album that summarises Billy's contribution to rock'nd roll music. Get this one, and you won't need to buy any other Idol's album."
4,i'm m.a.d. and i spelled it for nuthin,"this is the first of many albums to come from the great billy idol, and hopefully more to come, its got some classics such as white wedding and dancin' with myself, along with my personal fav, its so cruel. this is a great album, and a must have for any avid bily idol fans. steve stevens is stupendous, just as phenominal a guitar player now as he was back in the 80's when billy idol - billy idol first came out."
5,An indispensable resource for all actors.,So you want to be an actor? Then buy this book. You'll learn more reading these 248 pages than you will reading thousands of pages in all those other books on the business of acting.Actors have a tendency to let other people run their careers. They sit home waiting for the phone to ring when they could be out working on making their career happen. In this book Ms. Gillespie outlines plan to let you take control of your own career. I can't reccomend it highly enough.
5,Save yourself the trouble.,"This is my first Kindle and it went to my iPhone. Every time I had an extra few minutes I could pop up where I left off and read this great how to book on acting. I wish I had read this book 3 years sooner. I would have saved myself countless hours and money. I can verify that everything listed is exactly what any actor in LA needs to be successful. And thank you for the things I hadn't yet figured out on my own. The right websites, training, dos and don'ts. Talk about a short-cut to success? this is it"
5,If you are serious about you're acting career...get this book!,Bonnie Gillespie has incredible insight and can help you transform your career. What an incredible gift for you to give birth to this book and share this with us so we can fly. Thank you momma B for helping me build a safe nest and encouraging me to spread my wings.
5,Loved it!,"I absolutely loved it! It was both informative and entertaining. I think this is a great book for all actors looking to take control over their careers. It is also perfect for aspiring actors who don't know where to begin. This book describes every aspect of acting from preparing your head shot and resume, to a day on the set, to some harsh realities that can come with this career choice. I think this book is a great read and would really recommend it."
5,MSIA Saviour,Gundam MSIA line is underrated. Good use of rubbery plastic so it feels durable.Can survive falling off desks and shelves without worry due to good solid rubbery plastic construction.
3,Bobby's Girl still likes her,"Marcie's spoken intro to ""Bobby's Girl"" has the best NY accent ever! Just listen to her say, ""Now that I'm not a kid any muhr"" In stereo!This CD has every song Marcie recorded, probably, and if there are others, they likely have her wishing she stopped dating Bobby a long time since.This is a fine example of single Girl Group/ one hit wonder sound. Mostly mono and a lagniappe of of a time when single girl singers like Tracy Dey, Diane Renay, could rule the Top 40!Recommended for Bobbys all over the world!"
4,Nice Box! Not as pictured,"The Box I ordered as picutred is NOT what I got. What they sent is a very nice square box for one watch and is BLACK with a deep blue wood grain finish.I am happy with what they sent and will keep it. It is of equal value, BUT I was hoping to squeeze Two watches in the one pictured. Aw well... maybe that wouldn't have worked anyway.So, if you order this, I don't know what you'll get. At least they tried.Arrived on time as promised, in perfect condition."
3,Kind of strange movie,"First of all, the oldest living confederate widow married a civil war vet 40 years after the war, so her story really has little to do with the war and the south during the war, which is why I wanted to watch this movie in the first place. Second, this widow married a 50 year old at 14 years old, which means you have to watch a child get wedlock-raped while benign music plays in the background for half of the movie. Stranger still is when she supposedly falls in love with the old sheep.You see a number of other events in her life, the death of an infant, the blinding of her son, intermixed with clips of her life as an old person. It's interesting and funny at times, and is well-acted. It ends with an ode to parenthood, which I found pretty dull. That's all a 100 year old woman could come up with? It's ok, but if you're looking for something inspiring or historically rich, look elsewhere."
3,Buyer Beware!! This only works on WindowsXP!!,"While on WindowsXP this software was fantastic. I loved working with it and did not miss any features from programs like Microsoft Publisher. When I upgraded to Vista it stopped working, the company issued a patch for it, and it did not fix the situation.What I think is funny is that Microsoft states that this program is compatible with Windows 7, however it does not install the program at all even in any of the Compatibility Modes or Admin Mode. Here is a link so that you can see that I am not lying: [...]Again, if you are Windows XP, you will LOVE this software.Tom"
1,Publisher Pro was .,"Received two program disc 3 and NO program disc 2, therefore was unable to install and the program is of no value.Returned to producer. Have not heard from them. bas"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,This publication is not user-friendly and I highly recommend against purchasing this. The customization process of a ready-made product is almost impossible. I recommend Print Workshop 2010. Easy and intuitive.
5,Join the movement,"Addington and Graves hit the mark with their exploration of the faith and work intersection. This is a must read for believers in business and/or those wishing to connect their spirituality with where they spend the majority of their time- the marketplace. Whether you are a Fortune 50 CEO or a recently graduated college student, the message and content contained in the Fourth Frontier will catapult you to a new level of understanding and integration regarding your Life@Work. I recommend this book highly."
5,Time to integrate.,"This is an excellent read for those seeking to find God in their work. Excellent blend of history, theology, and the practicalities of integrating your work with the rest of your life. Great depth, yet fun to read."
2,"God wants us to work, be good and rest - the end","I guess I was not moved like some of the other readers of this book. I listened to the audio tape numerous times trying to understand the ""movement"" around this book. I spoke to other reader's as well and what I got was God wants us to work, represent his image at work and rest. This is not revolutionary or eye opening to Christians that walk in his light. The examples are predominantly Chick-fil-a and the founder of Chick-Fil-A has written his own book, ""It's Easier to Succeed than Fail"". There are many better books on Christian beliefs in the workplace. Try anything by Laurie Beth Jones for example."
4,Liked it,It is a fast down to earth book to read. You can buzz right through it and get all the information you need.
2,Don't buy this. Buy all his other Albums (jgmagnus@msn.com),"Don't bother buying this. I am SURE Moby did not authorize Elektra to make this CD. Why bother? Just buy ""Everything Is Wrong"" and others among his great works. This ""willy-nilly"" smattering of songs is rediculous and insulting to Moby. HALF of the songs on this list Moby didn't even make singles for. How can you say it's THE BEST of Moby if it wasn't even a single?? Moby is an AWESOME artist and I am dissapointed that Elektra made this album stating it is a ""BEST OF"".- Jayson"
3,Equivalent to Sonic Wallpaper,"I found this CD to be pleasant, soothing, unobtrusive background music. I enjoyed ""Play"" and other of Moby's work; however, I found this CD to be to be the equivalent of sonic wallpaper - it's there, but it is meant to fade into the background."
5,Excellent,I had never heard of Moby before Play and was seraching for more titles by him. This has to be the most fantastic CD I have ever bought!
3,Not what I thought,"Out of the sixteen tracks on this disc, only eight are worth listening to. Sure, there is the odd tight track, but the rest don't cut it. I thought I was buying a greatest hits cd, I was wrong. This contains tracks only produced by the elektra label, which is unfortunate. Because it means we miss out on singles like drop a beat, next is the e, myopia, etc. I also thought they'd include Moby's newest single ""flower"" but they failed to include that as well. If I were you I'd save my money and buy ""everything is wrong"" or ""moby"", his two best lps. But if your'e patient enough wait for his next cd...something not produced by elektra."
3,How to make everyone happy?,"Moby extracts his music out of musictime. A perfect squeeze for an intelligent musician. Everything I heard before, but, yes, maybe w out the 4x4 beat. Even my coughs -squeezmee!- sound right. Then again it's perfect music for beforethecockroachtime! Totally totally so so so specific"
3,"Great look, not great support","I really like these, I think they could use a little more support though."
3,Not really what I expected,"The late Jim Huber was a tremendous talent and any book that was compared to Tuesday's With Morrie most certainly had my attention. Personally, I don't really see how the two are related -- other than the most focus of a dying man. I found A Thousand Goodbyes to be mostly a biography with his fathers health issues sprinkled. The first 3/4 of the book is 90% about his career. The last 1/4 was exceptionally written and focused on the reason I bought the book in the first place. If you a fan of Jim Huber -- buy it. If you are looking for some insight on dying and what it's like to go through it with a loved one then look elsewhere."
4,A Thousand Goodbyes,It was good and it had lots of insights and stories about life and death and anecdotes about Jim's career.
2,Not so good,"I thought this was a terrible book. There are some interesting parts where he actually mentions his father and his father's passing, but they are few and far between. I thought the book was going to be more about his dying father and their relationship, but Jim Huber throws in random things about his career and he once wanted to be a minister, etc... I kept thinking, ""Okay...what's your point?"" I have to admit, I only read about halfway through the book, so maybe he really pulls it together at the end...I don't know because I decided that finishing it would be a waste of my time. The breaking point for me was when I read, ""The words likely fell on deaf eyes"" (p. 85). DEAF eyes? For an award-winning essayists Jim Huber really disappointed readers with this one."
2,Wobbler Kit,"Nothing wrong with the wobbler itself; however, the amazon ad didn't make it clear that it wouldn't work on the Do-All automatic thrower."
3,A book for guys who like books!,"This is a book for guys who like books! ""Deadly Ambition"" is a political thriller set in a small town in Illinois where the mayor is his party's chosen candidate for governor. The mayor, of course, hopes this will be his stepping stone to the Presidency. The only problem is, this particular candidate has a little trouble controlling his appetite for women. Fortunately for him, his campaign manager is ex-Special Forces and has certain resources at his disposal. Unfortunately for him, those resources are not always entirely predictable. This political thiller has it all - sex, intrigue, and murder. It's fun escapism and a good read."
4,Great solution to missing seat bottom,"This was the perfect fix for a missing seat bottom on my kayak. The adhesive is super strong, so it is permanently fixed until I want to remove it and it is also great for cold weather kayaking as it radiates heat. Don't know how it will be in the warm weather, but for now it's great."
2,No security,"If you are intending to include these envelopes with your invoices so that your customers can return their payment, think again. They do not have any security features. They are just thin plain white envelopes."
1,Stuck together right out of the box,The items themselves are nonspectacular - white envelopes that fit in No. 10 envelopes. But almost all of them were already sealed together right out of the box; I had to gently use a letter opener to get them opened! I don't know why - maybe they were improperly stored? I saw no water damage on the box or any of the envelopes. Very frustrating. Won't buy from this manufacturer again.
1,OK SERIOUSLY,"BE MORE PREDICTABLE, SERIOUSLY I HATE IT THAT REPUBLICANS USE THE UNPATRIOTIC CARD, IF SOMEONE HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW, THEY HATE AMERICA GROW UP AND REALISE YOU DONT HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT BOMBING COUNTRIES FOR OIL IS RIGHT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO HAS YOUR RELIGION TELLS YOU ITS OK."
2,Michael Moore and America,"Uncomfortable with his own title? Well, he should be. It discredits the work. Anyone who thinks Michael Moore hates America has got a serious neurons-missing problem. It is obvious that Michael Moore desperately loves America - but his America is a different one from the America of his critics. One can agree or disagree with him and still see that this is true. Come on, people! Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton disagreed deeply, probably more fundamentally than Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh do. But are there grounds for saying that both did not love their country?"
2,THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MICHAEL MOORE HATES AMERICA.,"Like some reviewers said before Michael Wilson use this title in order to get attention but this documentary is really about the criticism of Michael Moore's theories and the way he exaggerate his points of view on his movies: Bowling for Columbine, Roger and Me and Farenheit 9/11.Im sure that everything that Michael Moore says is NOT always true but he has many interesting points of view that we should think about them and not think of him as an american hater. He is a STRONG CRITICIZER! and he use to exaggerate in order to entertain the people that likes controversy. Of course, he doesn't offer many solutions but I understand that criticism is not exactly about solutions, is more about offering your points of view.P.S: Im not saying that I support Michael Moore in every way because there are MANY things that I disagree with him but I don't think of him as an enemy.Adios."
1,From Someone Who Doesn't Like Michael Moore,"The criticism surrounding Moore is extremely weak and at times feels contrived. This guy berates Moore for tricky editing, then turns around and splices in out-of-context scenes of Moore which portray him negatively. Look, Moore may have douche bag qualities, but it's for reasons other than what this documentarian is trying to argue. Very, very, very weak. I would like my 1 hour and 33 minutes back please."
3,RATHER DULL W/SOME INTERESTING POINTS,"IT WAS NICE TO HEAR ABOUT HOW MICHALE MOORE TWISTED FACTS (HESTON INTERVIEW, THE FACT THAT NRA DOES NOT EQUAL SECRET KKK, SUBRUBS AIN'T ALL THAT WHITE) . THE FILM WAS MUCH TOO LONG AND OFTEN BORING W/LOTS OF REPEATING POINTS. MANY PEOPLE OPPOSE THE IRAQ WAR BUT MW TWISTED IT TO MAEIT SEEM LKE ONLY STRANGE, FOREIGN ASIANS (WELL3 OR 4) OR OPPOSED IT EXCEPT WHEN THE MEDIA COMES ALONG. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN LOT OF ANTI WAR PROTESTORS! RATHER BLAND, BUT SOMETIMES FUNNY. THE U.S. HAS A HIGHER VIOLENT CRIME RATE, BUT MW ONLY SIAD CANAD'S IS HIGHER. (IT'S TRUE THAT THEIR NONVIOLENT CRIME RATE IS HIGHER. )"
4,The full michael moore treatment,"Michael Moore gets the full Michael Moore ""Roger & Me"" treatment in this somewhat satirical, somewhat serious 2004 documentary. This film isn't about why Michael Moore hates America, or even if he does; it's about how a documentarian can play loose with the facts."
1,I bet he got an invitation to the White House,"I'm surprised George Bush hasn't been waving this around. This film is for Americans who look at a map of the world and see America and a few islands. Hello to Americans in Michael Wilsons light. There are other great in fact greater countries out there, than America and yes they are important, even if they don't have oil Bush can steal. This film is for Americans who believe America is the centre of the Earth! Send your $10 to some orphan in Iraq instead of buying this pathetic excuse of a movie!"
1,He didnt speak about facts Moore brought in his films,"I think from the first moment you see this film you think its a good film and he really tries to show us the truth,but at the end you cant deny the fact that Factories had moved to Mexico to gain more profit,you cant deny the fact that 11000 People were Shot cause of guns every where,you cant deny any fact Moore has brought in all his films,whatever the way.I think this person is the one that hates America as Moore has said,and he is the one that destroys the American Dream,dealing with people as Numbers and Statics instead of human beings thats a dangerous thing,if this man was a real human and he really cares about Americans he would be sad all his life for one person has been shot and died.I dont know Moore in personal,and i dont know if he really feels what he says or not,but for me at least i was touched to hear him saying we would be judged on how we treat the least among us."
2,Prejudice on Parade,"This guy is guilty of everything he accuses Moore of. Innuendo and half truth doesn't make it so. This movie is like Fox News, opinion as though it were fact. Another swift boating. Two stars because it is a well made movie."
1,LACKS SUBSTANCE/FILTHY language,"I will admit, I'm no nun but when you have characters with disgusting nose rings in your film cursing left and right, like this cheesy film had, (I still don't know who was that hippie looking guy cursing in the film) the story begins to lose credibility very FAST for me.Michael Moore points out facts, facts that people don't want to hear or admit, but that's THE FACTS!That doesn't mean Michael Moore necessarily hates America. This film DID NOT substantiate that allegation and basically just bashed Michael Moore with no real facts. Sometimes I think the Michael Wilson has his personal agenda against Moore, and I'm not sure what that is.The film did many generalizations that are stupid. I wonder how much people got paid in this film to bash Moore.I'm not getting into a political discussion here but if you're going to make a film throwing some stupid allegation, you need to back it up!"
1,Ironic,What have you shown by discrediting Michael Moore's tactics by using those very same tactics? How does interviewing people who obviously hate Michael Moore show he hates America? If you can get by this there are some valid criticisms and interesting interviews. I'd recommend renting it from Blockbuster (I did).
3,Saloman Kane please rate the movie!,Your review doesn't really say anything about the movie. Just your feeling about Bush. I have not seen the movie yet. Have you?
1,Horrible.,"Lots of boring emotional stories, ad hominem attacks, I think I counted 2 actual criticisms of what Moore actually claims. I bought this DVD mainly because it says John Stossell is in it, he is NOT. I feel extremely ripped off."
5,The best michael moore film ever!,This exposes all michael moore is a big fat liar who care nothing about the truthor the people he hurts the only thing he cares about is ratings/money/and spreadingleft wing lies and propaganda! And how dare he call them documentarys when they are crockumentarys
1,Right wing,"To me,this film seems like a personal hate tirade against Michael Moore and against the very thing the film claims it defends: freedom of speech and different opinions. The film does not go as far as exploring the issues Michael Moore brought up-but character assassinating the guy. The style Moore used IS debatable, however this is not thoroughly examined. The film copies Moores style however does not have anything new to offer. Reminds me of what they did to the Dixie Chicks. And where in the opinion polls are all these people now who defended the president, the war and patriotism."
1,Where's the beef?!,"Only those with a masochistic penchant for unadulterated, hyperbolic propaganda will enjoy reading this book. I bought the same hoping to gain a better appreciation of the military aspects of the Bay of Pigs invasion as viewed from the defender's side. However, I soon found myself mired in such tiresome, propagandistic rhetoric that I gave up the effort..."
4,Awesome Chapman era collection,"This is an awesome collection of the Paul ""Tonka"" Chapman era of UFO (succeeding Michael Schenker as UFO's lead guitarist).This compilation gathers the best from the albums No Place To Run, Wild Willing & The Innocent, Mechanix, Making Contact, and Misdemeanor.Since these CDs are not available domestically here in the USA, this is a great opportunity to get a preview of some of these tracks for a decent price. If you like what you hear, the import prices on these 5 albums aren't that bad either..."
4,Great Insight,Really enjoyed this thoughtful insight to one or our greatest Presidents. The behind the scenes info. was interesting and the personal side inspiring. Great read (or listen in my case).
2,Nothing much new here......,"Maybe I was expecting too much from behind the scenes with Mr. Reagan. It just wasn't much new in this for me. Very little said about the many interesting events in Mr. Reagan's Presidency. Very little about the encounter with Gorbechev in Reykjevik, nothing about the 50th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, the Berlin speech, nothing about the Challenger disaster. It just didn't do it for me. Somehow I think Mr. Deaver missed a great opportunity here."
2,A Bit of Fluff,In the interest of disclosure. I was a supporter of Ronald Reagan and had a great deal of respect for the man.One the other hand this book seems like a job of fluff meant to eradicate Michael Deaver's economic misfortunes.I don't blame Mr Deaver for trying but he really doesn't deliver much more than a press secretary would offer about a person he admires. We don't get a good inside look. Just undying admiration.It's simply not worth the cover price
2,an unfocused memoir,"Deaver's short memoir of his years with Ronald Reagan jumps forward and back in time frequently so if you don't like that narrative style you won't enjoy the book. It's a little too worshipful and is far too sweet and is a good argument for why the best biographies tend to be written years after the subject's death. Deaver is so deep under the Reagan spell that the book reminds me more of an old 1940s MGM biopic. It's glossy, heroic and there are no warts. I found Peggy Noonan's book What I Saw At the Revolution to be much more realistic."
3,Michael Deavers Reagan,"This book followed a sequence of events only logical in Michael Deaver's mind. In my opinion, the book told us entirely to much about Mr. Deaver and his feelings, perceptions, etc. I was looking for something more Reagan. Sorry."
2,So So,"I was disappointed in this book. It is written by someone who obvisouly adored the President, therefore, he is not objective in his review. Save your money on this one."
1,Lasers and robots would make it better.,"If you wanted to make up a story of Ronald Reagon being as close to Jesus as possible, and needed to see an example of how, then I think this might be the book for you. The author, an indicted man himself, writes how he believed One Shot Ronny was incapable of telling even the smallest lie. The author's disclaimer, that the Gipper was a completly self-made man, provided much amusement as I read this deification from his former Media Strategist. But hey there's a sucker born every minute and they do need something to read."
4,The Personal Reagan,"""A Different Drummer"" doesn't aspire to be the definitive book about the life of Reagan, but it completely succeeds at what it does set out to do, which is to give us a funny, touching account of one man's life with Ronald Reagan. Deaver knew the President better than perhaps any of the others who have written about him with the possible exception of Nancy Reagan. Probably no one has as many revealing anecdotes to share. If you have a mini-collection on Reagan, ""A Different Drummer"" deserves to share the shelf."
5,EXCELLLENT CAMERA,I have had this camera for 4 years. I *LOVE* it... It is the only digital camera I have owned but it's the only one I believe I'll have. It is *SO* user friendly... It stays on my desk next to my computer at all times. I just need to invest in rechargeable batteries w/ a charger and I'll be set. It actually needs a 5+++ rating
4,"Good pics, good camera for the money",I bought this camera for my sister as a birthday present. She was excited and had the camera up and running in about 15mins. The instructions were easy for her to read. She sent me pics today and they were very nice! She said the only drawback was that the instructions did not explain how to email the pics. Only how to install the software. She eventually figured it out. Good first cam for the money. I am now getting the same one for myself.
2,poor download instructions- Photomax PDC 640 Plus,"I recently purchased a Poloroid PhotoMax PDC 640 Plus digital camera. I was impressed with the features and the pictures looked great on the LCD display. I connected the camera to my PC and the ac adapter, turned on the camera as instructed and nothing happened. An error message came up and said camera wasn't connected so I checked the connections and they were fine so I tried it again, no luck. I then turned off the PC, rechecked all the connections and went back step by step AGAIN and I cannot get the pictures transferred from my camera to PC. I re-read the help in the software and troubleshooting in the users guide and I am back to the beginning. NO HELP from the website from Poloroid, where did they go? Pretty frustrated in Poloroid products and this was a waste of money if it won't transfer pictures to PC. Is a reader required or what's up with this?"
4,This camera is great for the price.,"For the price, this camera is inexpensive and easy to use. The tech support at Polaroid is helpful if you have any problems and the website is useful as well. I use this camera for auctions and taking pictures of family members. It eats batteries quickly, and the flash takes a long time to get ready. The picture quality however, is very good. It doesn't look cheap or feel cheap, which is important for making a purchase like this. The good news too is that the price will be going down as with all new technology. You can't go wrong with this camera."
1,Do Not Buy This,"I am so glad that I brought this camera back. It was nothing but trouble. I could not even get it to load the software in order to see the pictures I had taken. I called Polaroid, no help. I emailed, no help. They even suggested that I buy a different camera. That was the only good advice that I got from them. I am still looking for another, but be sure it WILL NOT be a Polaroid. I will never buy another Polaroid anything. I helped several family members and friends avoid problems with them too. Stay away if you don't want problems."
2,Great Little Camera,"This is a great little camera for email pictures and such, it dosn't replace a 35mm. Be sure to get NiMH rechargable AA Batteries, which work much better than regular batteries."
2,Very low quality pictures,If you're looking for a digital camera for beginners this camera might be nice for you but don't expect great quality pictures. Printing and enlarging the photos renders them extremely blurry. Even when printing small prints the quality isn't much better. If you are only interested in using the pictures from this camera on your computer then you might find this camera better suited for you.The batteries drain very quickly. Distance shots are very poor. The camera does have a nice look to it and it feels good in the hand. Operation is fairly simple. It does have a screen in the back to view photos. The software that comes with the camera is actually better than the camera. I would suggest that this camera be given to a young person just starting out in the digital photo game. Adults may find this camera very disappointing.
2,Eats battery like crazy,"This is was my first camera. Slightly overpriced (I paid +- 167 uS$). It's heavier than you think. Uses 4 AA batteries that drain rapidly, it's fast enough to take photos, but I dont like quality of them. Seems granulated.. it's no crystal-clear picture to me."
2,There are better cams for the money,I bought this camera about 5 years back. I'm really surprised they are still selling something this antiquated. With only 0.3 megapixles it is not a good camera if you intend to print out the images. I purchased it for web work and it does a decent job but even with the 72dpi resolution you get from your monitor shows to many flaws in the image. It comes out to grainy and the colors of people are often to orange/red. The software often locks up and tells you it can't complete the action and you have to hit the retry button on every image to get the pictures off the camera. It does that on Win98 and my W2K boxes. All in all I would suggest spending the money on another camera. Polaroid does make some good cameras but this one is really past it's time.
4,great starter digital camera,"this is a great starter camera, as far as digital cameras go. the only drawback for it is that it eats batteries badly...my suggestion is to also purchase a rechargeable battery system with at least 8 AAs, so you can have some in the camera at all times. this would be a great camera for people interested in getting into digital photography."
2,Disappointed in Colorado,"I bought this camera as a Christmas gift for my husband. Luckily I ordered early because I had to return it twice. The first time it worked for a few days before experiencing an internal error - it flashed an error code repeatedly and with no explanation in the user's manual what the code meant, I had to call technical support. I was advised to return it to Amazon, and did. Although they were helpful, the replacement was backordered for over a month. When it finally arrived, it was defective right out of the box! I finally exchanged it at a local store. Now that I have one that works, I am relatively pleased with it (although the software locks up occasionally) but don't think the camera was worth all that effort. If you choose this one, brace yourself for a hassle before finally getting it to work."
4,Good camera bad service,"I just bought this camera for the holidays the quality of the pictures is great and when you display the pictures in the tv set looks very good. But when I tried to connect the camera to the pc it didn't work looks like the port at the camera or the cable aren't working. When I brought it to the dealer (Multimax Panama City) they told me that they can give a new one and that I have to turn it to the customer service for diagnostics it's been almost a week, Polaroid should have better representatives so we, the customers can really appreciate the quality of your product.Thanks"
1,Piece of garbage.,"Also known as the Agfa e-photo, this camera lasted me 18 months, and that includes the 4 weeks it spent being returned to the manufacturer. The thing EATS batteries, the flash takes FOREVER to recharge, the battery door compartment is a joke. It mercifully died completely recently. You get what you pay for. Avoid this pile of dung if at all possible."
3,CD-ROM doesn't work,"I'm running Windows XP and I can't get the CD-ROM to work. A bunch of error messages pop up. I can't find any online support, either. Luckily, this copy is from my library, but if I had to buy a computing dictionary, I would choose either Webster's New World Computing Dictionary or A Dictionary of Computing from Oxford as both were were written more recently."
1,"Telescoping mechanism gets stuck and ""pinches""","I bought this from a local hardware warehouse and am looking for a replacement. I've used it about 6 months. The problem is with the telescoping handle. It's one of those where you twist it so that a little internal ""wheel"" is turned off-center to release it to telescope in/out. However, it gets stuck in ""closed"" and sometimes in the field I can't get enough of a grip (sweat, dirt, rain) to release it - very frustrating. WORST thing is that your skin can get pinched inside the telescope and it HURTS. I hate this thing."
3,NightlyReading Reviews,"WOW!!! Lauren and Nick did not really care for each other. Lauren thought that Nick was a bad boy type and Nick thought Lauren was a spoiled princess. Geesh, they could never have been more wrong about each other!I loved reading Lauren's diary entries! It really made the reader think about their own fantasies. I also enjoyed the fact that every single fantasy Lauren had ended with the guy embracing her. What woman does not want to cuddle after sex???Nick was a sweet guy and you really see his sweet side when he is with his brother. The whole situation with his bother, his father and him was a little frightening and I am not sure if I would ever have spoken to my father again if he had done something so awful???The ending was really sweet and it made me swoon over Nick!In conclusion, the love story to this book was great, but the character's actions were a little predictable. But, the sex was HOT!! So, in my opinion, it kind of evened out!!"
4,Good book.,"I was pleasntly surprised by this book. I had never herd of Toni Blake, but the back of the book drew me in and I bought it. It was a very good book. But I thought that the end should have told us more about if anything was resolved between Nick and his father. It was such a big issue, but it didnt have any closeur. I felt like there was more, but that was it. I did want the book to keep going. I have to say one of my favorite parts of this book was the other half of the end. Where he tries to get her back. Beautiful."
5,A Very Touching Erotic Romance,This book by Toni Blake is NOT your typical erotic romance. It has warm endearing characters and a really touching story.Nick is a housepainter with a wounded heart. Lauren writes her sexual fantasies in a Red Diary which Nick finds while painting her house. He is enticed by what she has written. He knows he shouldn't keep invading her privacy but continues to read the diary. They have some history and at first Nick wants to get even for a past wrong.Lauren's love teaches Nick that love can heal even the worst of wounds. I definitely recommend this book!!!!
3,Hard to get into the story,Love all of Toni Blakes book but this one took me about a week to read. Had a hard time getting into the characters and the story.
3,Pretty good,Not very realistic. The situations were kind of predictable. I like a little more humor. I also would have liked more interaction with her father.
1,Wish there was a rating system,"Wish I could have returned the book after the first page turned out to be cheesily written porn. This is one of those books I'm trying to get off my ereader. Would love there to have been an X rating in this so I wouldn't have wasted my money. Maybe the author told a good story, or had excellent character development, but I couldn't tell you. Didn't bother to read on."
3,DAMN!,darn it what happened to it being 99 cents I really regret not buying it!! it looks like a good book!!
3,Valuable Only if you agree to agree,"If the other parent shows up with this book it MAY WORK OUT. If you see the other side as being abusive and uncooperative, that's probably how he or she sees you. This book really tries to help in reaching an agreement, but you will probably end up asking the court for help."
5,Great Product. !!,Not too difficult to install. I installed with mower deck still on but was more difficult this way. Product fit perfectly and seems to work better than the tractor originally did. The only negative was the base plate holes were not threaded but all you have to do is thread the bolts threw each of them before the install. Quite easy! Great product.
5,A Very Practical and Informative Book,This book provides more practical and applicable information than any other book that I have read on the subject.
5,Get Ready for Negotiating,"An excellent book to help become prepared for negotiating. The book represents the private sector and FLRA.If you're with a government organization, local, state, or federal, you can gain some pointers from this but you need to check around for negotiating specifically for the government. You should look for a book that discusses the Fair Labor Standards Act and how managers, even though government employees under most bargaining agreements, are treated like gods. Look for a book that tells it like it is with management mafia in control, allowed to violate federal laws and legally binding agreements with government attorneys to protect them with taxpayer money."
2,What's the big deal?,"Maybe I'm missing something here, fanatics, but if you already own the 70's box set, which most Elvis' fans do, the first CD is pointless. The second CD is pretty much the same as ON STAGE and LIVE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, and if you hear any big difference between the versions found on those releases and the ones on this package, then Mister you're a better man than I. Which leaves us with CD 3. I'll take ""I Got A Woman"", ""Stranger In The Crowd"", the eerie finale of ""Farther Along/O Happy Day"", and the King's intro to ""Twenty Days"", where he sums up 75% of his career when he tells the audience that he's about to sing a new song that isn't particularly good or that he even likes, but here it is anyway, ladies and gentlemen. Why do I have the feeling that RCA still has a dozen or so great moments from this period that will pop up on 10 future releases? And the packaging isn't anything to get excited about, either."
4,This one is not a gimmick.....,"Lately one has learned to be careful in feeling excitement in the release of ""unreleased"" Elvis material, meaning unreleased on CD or cassette does not always mean that the material does not already exist on video or in some other form. Although these disc do contain some material that is already on the market, the known material is far outweighed by the unknown and unheard. Yes we have heard these songs before, but the energy in which Elvis performs these particular versions is incredible. Also a portion of Elvis' shows that at times gets ignored on other material, the banter between star, band, and audience,is well represented. Elvis' mentioning of a new record coming out on the date ""January 1979"" is poignant however considering what transpired. The only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars is the absence of new songs never heard that Elvis recorded at particular Vegas shows and that have long been rumored to have been recorded."
5,The Single Best Elvis Box Set Ever,"If I were ever told to surrender my Elvis collection except for one item...my personal copy of this amazing box set would be the one for me.It showcases Elvis at his best.Stranger In The Crowd,How The Web Was Woven,Sylvia and Twenty Days and Twenty Nights are gems...seldom played.seldom heard and way over-looked...they are brought to light here.The concert disc...disc 2...is a classic by itself...and to think once you hear it you have one more to listen to...disc 3...which features some more live songs then you here Elvis in rehersel...which puts you on the front row of something historic...many of these have NEVER been heard before.Awesome.Amazing.You name it...This is the way it is....The Best Elvis Boxed Set that ever has been or will be released."
5,"Visually Beautiful, Socially Important","This book captures - visually and through the written word - the untold story of so many of our nation's workers without whom our greatest institutions would exist on much weaker foundations. Greg Halpern - through the lens of his camera and the words of the workers he met and befriended - poignantly illustrates the unfortunate plight of so many workers who give so much to their jobs but whose jobs and employers give so little to them. This is a must-read, must-view book for anyone who cares about the state of our nation's workforce. This book is a wonderful way to pay homage to the amazing people who are the true, yet tragically invisible, backbone of Ivy League institutions like Harvard."
4,Romance with a hint of mystery,"This was a cute and fun book. Easy reading, with great characters. This is the second book that I have read by this author. I'm looking forward to reading more of her books."
4,a tight group,"This was Oftbs first and only album. They have tight flows and rip up all their tracks they do hard. They are one of my old favourites, but I liked the things they were coming out with after this even more which was only done as appearances and on compilations. This album has got a few weak songs on it, but is definately worth getting. They were too underrated and should have been much more respected than a lot of other groups. If you want a tight CD get this one while you still can."
3,Nice walk through he woods,"Need to block out the hustle and bustle of the work day, this will do it. The walk is a little slow like the other vids but provides a nice deep green view of the forest. Not very stimulating but will be relaxing. I alternate it out with several others to maintain interest. Kind of boring on its own."
5,More Than a Mountain is More Than a Book,"This book is more than a young mans cycling adventure. After reading the book i felt as though i had more direction in my life. The book caused me to think about the kind of person I want to be and the things I want to experience, and showed me that stepping outside my comfort zone will enrich my life. While reading i found myself thinking about all the opportunities i have missed in my lifetime and decided that i wanted to change my lifestyle."
3,"Okay. Don't set your expectations too high, though.","This book was pretty good. Overall I enjoyed it. The cycling stuff is pretty good if you're a cycler. Don't expect to walk away with a new sense of purpose in life, though, as some other reviewers might suggest. You'll probably be disappointed. Take it for what it is. A good, but somewhat immaturely written DIARY of a teen who happens to be a decent cyclist and how he spent a year in France."
1,Not What I Had Hoped For...,"Knowing this story was written by a teenager still didn't prepare me for the lack of literary proficiency. This book contains the ramblings of an exchange student who thinks very highly of his cycling ability. Of all the books I've read in the cycling genre, this one is at the bottom of the list. I do not recommend purchasing this item."
1,Not Such A Good Book,"This is an excellent book for grades 5-12. It should be on every jr high reading list. It was written by a 17 year old exchange student on a very simple reading level. Even though it has 180 pages, many pages have few words. The avid adult cyclist will be disappointed."
3,Pretty lame,"I was looking for a board book that had lots of things for little hands to manipulate or feel (zippers, buttons, snaps, bows, elastic, fabrics) in lieu of a Dressy Bessy or Dapper Dan doll, which have been taken off the market. This is poor substitute. Although this book has a button, snap and zipper, they are all on the cover, obviating the need to even open the book. The rest of the pages are a jumbled busy mess of drawings of kids, with their clothing labeled and a simple rhyming story to go along with the drawings."
1,An extremely medicore CD,"The raps aren't very original (mostly unison raps, with an annoying self-congratulatory trip on the opening cut). The problem is weak song material that often falls into mediocrity. Some of the song sources (Babyface, some Isleys) are impressive, but most of the songs were written by the guys and/or their exec. producer, Mike Conception, and those are pretty weak for the most part. (Do we really need yet another ""I Want Your Body"" song? What is that, the 45th song on that theme?)"
4,Excellent reference,"This is a great book to have on hand. Pope John Paul's set of encylicals compromise a modern, comprehsensive presentation of Catholic theology. Father Donders makes these writings available to the more casual reader. Reading these encyclicals is a great way to reflect on the great pontifcate of Pope John Paul II. Highly recommended."
1,taking ATS-W?,If you are taking the ATSW dont bother with this book. The multiple choice questions and review give you about 40% of what you need for the exam. As for the essay look else where; this book does NOT help at all with the essay. Use what you learn in classes and the popular/current teaching practices to guide you.
5,A must-have for Tull collectors,"This album is a must whether you are new to Tull or are an avid fan like myself. If you are new then the album takes you through the whole spectrum of Tull from the early heavy blues days to the modern, slick production material. But the real gems are the previously unreleased tracks - Part of the Machine , Kelpie , Overhang -Tull at their very best. Buy it just for these alone, you won't be disappointed.And for those of you who are interested in the origins of songs there is a bonus . Lick Your Fingers Clean is a track recorded for Aqualung that didn't make the album. Tull fans will recognize the lyrics and basic song structure as Two Fingers that is on the Warchild album!All in all , this album is worth every penny."
5,loved it!,"I've been faithfully reading Hollis's columns in CL for a little over three years and when I heard that she had a book coming out I was on Amazon like a minute later. Her columns are always honest, hilarious!, inspring, thought-provoking, accurate, and the book is equally as great. I'd recommend it to anyone, and my best friends already have their copies on the way."
1,not very funny,"I bought this book on an enthusiastic recommendation. What a mistake. It has a few amusing vignettes, but overall is not very funny. A lot of rambling blurbs about some guys named Larry and Grant. She never explained who these guys were, or what their roles were. The writing is very poor--she rarely comes up with the right word. She doesn't write complete stories, just word images. So often my response to a section was ""okay and then what?"". Please, David Sedaris she isn't. Take a close look before you buy."
4,Had me laughing out loud!,"This book was a real page turner! This collection of randomly assorted personal accounts by the author, really allows its reader to say to oneself, ""I'm not so weird after all."" Her collection of strange obsessions and proclamations makes even the most insecure freak, feel right at home. The term ""freak"", in a GOOD way. This book also emphasizes the value of the various human connections we make throughout our lives. The assorted adventures the author described sharing with her compadres throughout her book is almost envious. A definitely, highly recommended read."
4,like it,"nice product,when the bottle was full, it was easy to use. i bought the spray because it's more easy to apply. I have very energetic dog, so spray better than gel. but when I have used a lot of spray,than was difficult to apply because if you turn bottle upside down it difficult to apply. the quality is nice.it took 3weeks aprox to heel the irritation, but i still have something in the bottle"

5,THE RULES ARE CLEAR,"A GOOD MOVIE WILL SIMPLY ENTERTIAIN YOU. A GREAT MOVIE WILL ENTERTAIN YOU, AS WELL AS IT WILL LEAVE YOU WITH SOMETHING, EMOTIONALLY. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. I'M NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN IT, I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT. I LOVE THIS FILM."
5,Middle-class life in suburban,"Scott Rosenberg(screenplay writer of the movie) accomplishes something really amazing in this movie. You wont find heroes or heroines. You wont find an amazing story or spectacular scenary in this movie. You will actually find yourself. At least, I found myself. I found myself laughing, not because the jokes played in the movie and the characters are funny (although they really are). I found myself laughing at myself, because I see myself in the very same situations and quandaries that the characters go through. this movie very frankly describes middle class suburban life. I bet millions of people in the states live more or less the same life portrayed in the movie. What makes this movie great is not so much for its surprises, entertainments, or comedic elements. the thing that makes this movie really a great movie is the realism of the portrayal. What makes me really like this movie is the fact that this movie makes me feel comfortable, as if I am back at home."
3,"Yes, the Girls Are Beautiful","As a showcase for eye candy, the movie works. The story is nothing extra. Worth a look, especially for the pre-teen Nat Woman and her ""romance"" with a college guy."
3,Dumb Guys but Sweet,"Ted Demme has offered us a sweet reunion of small town, New Englander, twenty-somethings. There is some Big Chill here 1990's style, but for the most part, the guys that stayed home and married or almost married are blue-collar, beer drinking, and chick panting types. High school big man, Matt Dillon is still respected for his womanizing skills. Tim Hutton has a girl back in New York City, but his musical career is getting old and his thirteen-year-old neighbor girl attracts. The relationship between a young man and an adolescent could have been really creepy, but there's some deft writing and directing, so we enjoy this impossibility for a few hours. Uma Thurman vamps as the perfect chick. Each of the single guys gives her a rush, but she's just out of reach as any apparition. My wife really liked this one. Maybe there's more appeal to chicks in this flick because Rosie O'Donnell in a minor part sure makes a mockery of men and their desires."
5,My favorite movie of all time!,"Beautiful girls is no doubt my favorite movie of all time. Every actor/actress did a ""superb"" job with their character. Timothy Hutton did an incredible job and played willie's character beautifully. I feel that the movie would not have been as good if it weren't for Natalie Portman. She did such a great job in this movie. I think that just about any guy would be willing to wait 5 years for her. The only thing that i didn't like about this movie was how Willie used the winnie the pooh story. I was really hoping that he would decide to wait. This is the one of the few movies that i actually dreaded to see end. Its just a movie that you wish would never end. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
4,"a slice of life, funny and poignant","A ten-year class reunion is approaching as we are introduced to a group of likable yet clueless guys, and the longsuffering women in their lives. Rosie O'Donnell delivers a stellar performance as the voice of wisdom and tries togive the guys a dose of reality therapy.The all-star cast performs well in putting together this light-hearted look at the angst of youth. You will laugh out loud at some hilarious dilemmas as well as smile wryly at some universal truths. Recommended."
5,great movie,"this movie is amazing, the acting is excellent and the story line is excellent as well.. most of you will be jealous to know that I go to high school with Natalie Portman, and get to see her everyday, which is great considering I am a big Star Wars fan, and she appears as a queen in the upcoming prequels in may"
5,"If you haven't already, watch this movie ASAP.","The relationship between Willie and Marty is the thing that makes this movie, him wanting the beautiful girl (and even though it seems kind of sick I found myself wanting her as well) yet knowing that it's an impossible fantasy. The fact that she likes him as well makes it even harder to handle but as is illustrated we all have to face reality sometime however hard that may be. The yearning for something unattainable is sad and something that a lot of people can probably identify in some way, and that's something that makes this movie great - the way in which there's a part of (I guess almost) everyone in some form in this movie. A great script with excellent music this is one movie that you'll want to watch again and again. A lot more special than your run of the mill Hollywood blockbuster. I've always wanted to find a favorite movie, and I've decided that this is it."
5,The best I've seen,"Beautiful Girls is a great lighthearted comedy mixed with certain aspects of drama. The attractive, however unlikely, romance between Timothy Hutton and the ever adorable and loveable Natalie Portman stole the show (and my heart). If you have not seen Beautiful Girls and are looking for a laugh, a cry, and a feel-good movie, I strongly suggest that you go pick up a copy."
1,"[Poor] excuse for ""entertainment""","For me this film has the exact same appeal as a TV soap opera (where is exactly where it belongs) -- and I despise TV soap operas. Of course, there are lots of TV soaps and they have been airing for decades, so obviously there are a quite a few people who like this sort of ""entertainment"". If, like me, you are not one of them then you are likely to feel the same way about this film that I did. I found it to be boring, depressing, sometimes disgusting, ..., inane garbage. On the other hand if you like the gut-wrenching-downer sort of movie here's your flick -- enjoy.Natalie Portman was a bright spot and her talent was shining through. However, no 13-year old on the planet would talk the way she did in the film.This is the last time I will ever trust a ""two thumbs up"" rating from Siskel and Roeper. I give it two thumbs down and will be selling my copy ASAP."
5,Great Great underrated movie,"Any guy between 24 - 33 not married, should watch this movie. great cast, great lines, great soundtrack...and like Michael Rappaport says ""they're all sisters""..."
5,Very good,I ike any movie with Matt Dillon. The bonus was Tim Hutton too. Two good actors and good supporting cast.
2,What's there to like?,This should have been a TV-movie. There are too many characters that get little screen time. The story goes way too fast and the editing is very awkward.And another thing. What is so special about Natalie Portman's performance in this film? Her acting was average and any competent teenage actress can do what she did in that film. Big deal.Maybe I just don't see it.
2,Why Did I Buy This ?,"Beautiful Girls is a movie you can easily avoid. I bought it based on the fine list of actresses: Mira Sorvino, Lauren Holly, Natalie Portman (about 13 in this one and the only bright spot in the whole movie), Uma Thurman etc. It takes place in the winter in Minnesota (who thinks up these things?). Uma Thurman (fine looking face) never takes her coat off in the whole movie. After I watched it, I looked at the DVD cover to see why I ever bought it (49 wasted) and it said on the cover that it was a comedy. Always up for a good comedy. I didn't know it was supposed to be funny. I am going to watch it again with new understanding, I hope. I had NO IDEA this was a funny movie. I should have read the cover before I watched it; I could have anticipated the clever nuances of humor so cleverly disguised as boring stupid garbage. Other people should be warned. This movie literally makes The Grass is Greener appear humorous in comparison."
1,Disappointed,"This movie is about a group of low class, small town boys, with big mouths and little brains. The girls have wee bit parts which do not start until well into the movie. It should have been titled Small Town Boys because it has little to do beautiful girls! I suspect that if you are from a small town and do possess a little brain, this movie will be quite appealing to you . . ."
1,Beautifual Girls? Where?,"What is the fascination with this movie, Beautiful Girls? The acting was poor, the plot thin and the action slow. The girls weren't even that 'Beautiful' (Rosie O'Donnell?). As for the guys, their roles were shallow. And the reunion? The old 'buddies' didn't even GO to a reunion!Uma was 'too cool,' Willie was dull as a brick, Marty was a fakely deep (""Let's walk this world together"" -gag). The good actors included Rosie O'Donnell, Matt Dillon and Noah Emmerich, barely.'Beautiful Girls' is a dry flick and characters disappear without and appear without mention (Uma, Rosie). The music was bland and the movie had no depth. Blah, blah, blah, you AREN'T missing out if you have not seen it."
4,THIIS IS NOT A REMASTERED TITLE,"**WARNING** - THIS TITLE IS NOT REMASTERED (For superior sound quality).Despite the statement by Amazon on the second page for this album, this is the same sound recording as originally issued in the 1980's.You can purchase a remastered album on a compilation issued by BGO Records (it also has ""Precious Time"" for 2 albums on 1 CD)."
5,Classic work of art,I have had this in my personal collection for many years and it never goes out of style! Pat's voice is intense and absolutely fantastic! She sings with precision! You can't help but not get goosebumps! Highly recommended.
3,Made a mistake.,I payed way to much for this CD.When I received it there was a sticker over the original for 9.99 in June 2012.to 45.00 in January 2013.dumb on my part but it has nostalgia for me.
3,Some Style Changes But Result Is Still Mixed,"I respect Pat Benatar for changing her approach for this release. There are some creative keyboard effects that work quite nicely here specifically on Looking For A Stranger and Get Nervous. Pat also tones down some of her shrieks which is somewhat of a good thing. However, there are way too many filler tracks especially on the second half of this disc. Probably a Greatest Hits Compilation is the best way to collect Pat's music."
3,Mistaken reading of breastfeeding passage,I wrote an earlier review which was mostly a negative reaction to the recommendation that a six month old child be weaned. The author was kind enough to point out that I had misread the passage in question: the child Chidekel was writing about was six YEARS old. I offer my apologies to Dr. Chidekel for my mistaken criticism. I did find much of value in what Chidekel has written about emotions from our own childhoods arising with regard to our own children. I also enjoyed the case study examples. I am not adding the book to my library because it was not clear enough to me at what ages the author's various recommendations should apply. I prefer John Rosemond's books.
4,"Solid Low-Budget Anthology from the Producers of Wicked Lake, & Hills Run Red","Length:: 7:20 MinsHorror Happy Hour reviews ""Late Fee"" -the anthology horror flick from the producers of: Wicked Lake, Hills Run Red, Flesh for the Beast, & Shadow: Dead Riot"
3,i enjoyed it,"cool halloween type of movie, its 2 short stories and a story with in them as well if that makes sense lol. The first one I liked it was creepy,and weird but good, the second one I really didnt care for. To be honest I liked the begining of the movie the middle of the movie and the end of it the best, those are the parts that all take place on halloween night.Some creepy people in the movie for sure ! if you like horror and halloween i think you will enjoy this movie"
2,Okay but not what Vols Fans Are Looking For,"I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for my husband who is a die-hard Tennessee fan and has been for 20+ years. After listening to it, he said, ""Ah, it's okay. Rocky Top isn't right."" It's something to add to a collection, but don't be counting on much use of it."
3,A few key points worth learning,"Having read several books on Gettysburg, I read this to fill in some details on the battle sequence and dependencies and another perspective on the key reasons for Confederate defeat. The book provided this but was uneven in style and is clumsy with all the quotes saying the same thing over and over... about how bad it was for everyone that lived through it. Take aways: The South lost because: (1) Lee's leadership style and communication problems, (2) Disadvantaged ground (3) Too little artilery to complete what they started. Details on battle sequence is useful but disjointed."
2,disappointing,"The book provides new (to me) insights into often overlooked portions of the battle, specifically the cavalry actions of July 3rd. This concludes the good part of this review...The attention received by Culp's Hill and Pickett's Charge is abbreviated and generally lacking when compared to other available texts on these subjects. A hard-core buff can find more depth and less confusion elsewhere, yet it's a bit much for casual readers.The writing is painfully inconsistent. Some sections are written around first person accounts and are clean, clear and exciting. In contrast, the technical passages that attempt to detail the ""what where how when"" of units' movements and activities are muddy and confusing and sometimes inconsistent with the maps that are juxtaposed throughout the book."
2,I'm a bit disappointed.,"While this book is exhaustive in it's verbal detail, it is too lacking in visual support - maps - to keep it all in mind while wading through it. And, what few maps there are are hard to find, and hard to refer back to because of the rag-edge paper the book is printed on. All in all, I would suggest another source for this battle."
3,History or Myth?,I found this dvd to be entertaining though I cannot vouch for the facts. This was from the Discovery channel and you could certainly tell where the commercial breaks had been because they repeatedly told you what program you were watching. That got to be extremely annoying. If not for that I would have given this four stars. It did raise some interesting questions about the truth behind the story of the Exodus and give one someting to ponder. I would definitely like to see more about this archaeological site and hope they do a DNA test to see if the skeleton found truly was Rameses' son. I would recommend renting it first or borrowing it from the library before buying it.
4,Very enjoyable!,"Regardless of the commercial breaks and the repetition of information, (And it being 1am =D) the program overall was very interesting. I've often wondered about the 10 plagues story, how the exodus story was described from the Egyptian POV. It was great to see a scientific view to the what may have really happened.It's wonderful how our scientific technology has come so far to put faces on the skulls we find from generations back. (Have you seen King Tut??) It puts a real face on these stories that are so old, they seem to be fables and about people who didn't really exist. This program also showed the process used to put a face on the unknown remains found in the tomb.I love studying Ancient Egyptian history and this was a great addition to my knowledge."
3,Went on..and on,"This movie was alright. from a documentary point of view it had it's downfalls. At the end of the documentary I had the same knowledge as I did at the beggining. The movie doesn't really answer any questions but ask the same ones over and over again. If you want information on Rameses II try picking up a book. Although I loved the fact that they showed a lot of the tomb, and the recreation of Rameses and his family was also good."
3,Meeting the Other Crowd,All of these stories about fairies were told to the author by the older generations that are now grandparents. These were stories never written down but told by word of mouth.There were only a few I really enjoyed. The rest of them seem to tell the same story over and over. A lot of the stories were similar to the last. That being said it is still cool to have the stories written down so generations can see the stories that some of the kids and adults grew up believing about fairies.
5,running with the other crowd,"In many ways...dear lovers of Faerie,... this book is a modern supplement toThe Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries. If you liked that book, you'll surely enjoy this one, although, this book is perhaps a bit more personal, less scholarly perhaps, or less restrained in it way. A bit more of that faerie charm and enchantment resides here. It delighted us and we expect, if you love fairy lore, it will call to you as well.kyela,the silver elves"
2,Road to Nowhere,"Lack of quote marks, ultra-emotionally-reserved protagonist, a woman he can't have, the self-destruction of a farm -- is this Lennon's homage to Cormac McCarthy? Perhaps. This is by and large a one-note book, and that's what kills it. The book flatlines from beginning to end, and the supporting cast is no help -- they're either annoying (Sophia) or pretentious (Max). And the ending is just lame lame lame. I didn't expect to read The Funnies again, but this was downright torturous, a slow, muddled book that goes nowhere."
5,Awesome gift idea!,I got this gnome for my Dad for Christmas and he loves it. It is a must have for any die-hard Alabama fan! ROLL TIDE!!!!
1,Reproduction is a generous description,"This book is probably one of the poorest reproductions ever conceived. It's as if they took photographs of the original, printed them out, spilled black ink on the pages then stack scanned the pages during an earthquake. The majority of this ""book"" is unreadable. To give an idea of the level of attention paid to this book the title isn't even printed on the spine.The original is a fantastic and classic resource, go find a used copy and skip this product."
4,excellent,"This is one album I let sit too long before playing. Matching Mole may begin with a ballad, typical of Robert Wyatt's more song oriented, post-Soft Machine work.But as it progresses, the album seemlessly becomes more avant gaurde, with the same organ drones and chromatic storms that catagorized the Softs. Keep playing, and slowly, with loving craftiness, Wyatt unfolds the album into wonderful noise, even more layered than his work with Hopper and Rattledge. This sneaks up, and the unfolding makes for an amazing listen.Great work by a master modernist."
3,Everything you'd expect!,Adorable illustrations. Liked it better than the Cookies cookbook because I'm single & the family recipes in it were of no use to me.
5,Lovely and captivating!,"You know that it was a good book because after reading the last page you feel as if you`ve lost a good friend. There`s hardly another book with a plot like a humorous history lesson. The title of the German original (Nächstes Jahr in Jerusalem = ""Next year in Jerusalem"") tells about the distinct awareness of the Jewish to find their peace in the end. Without that awareness and their unbeatable sense of humour - how would they have survived years and years of pogroms, attacks and ignorance from the side of the Non-Jewish? It is a warm-hearted story with wonderful side-swipes at human stupidity and mediocrity. And it is a must read for all those who love Jewish literature. Enjoy it and have a good laugh! Interested in the topic? Another recommendable reading might be ""Her victory"" by Alan Sillitoe."
2,Eh,"This shower curtain is really cute and I love the material. However, if it gets the slightest bit wet, the black dye bleeds all over the place. After having it only a week, it looked terrible. If I would have known I never would have purchased this product. Waste of money."
1,Bleeds!!,"I bought this from target. It bleeds where it gets wet. Instructions say to prewash first, but it still bleeds.WHY would they make a fabric SHOWER curtain that is in daily contact with WATER bleed??!?!?Don't waste your money."
2,Nice Cover but not for X9,"I got this to protect my X9 winch because my motor went bad due to rust from rain. It fits size wise but it will not fit my winch unless I cut a side to fit the wires from control to the motor, and the cut will fall right were I need the protection (over the motor). Anyone that has this winch knows what I'm talking about. This is a generic cover definitely not custom made to fit this winch. I'll just use it for looks not for the intended purpose. Not recommended."
4,a fun page-turner,"It's neat to think a real psychiatrist wrote this. Is this what it's really like? The selfish and ambivalent thoughts ring true. It's a little fairy tale-ish, in that everyone gets better through analysis. And Carolyn, the evil witch of a lawyer, is painted as such a feminist joke that her transformation into a real person felt false. But, hey, I woke up in the middle of the night to spend 2-1/2 hours polishing it off."
5,A psychotherapy of psychotherapy,"Serious yet funny surprises at each page. In Hebrew, yalom means diamond. So it is."
3,A great read while your analyst's away.,"Dr. Yalom writes a breezy account of individuals entrapped by the principles of integrity, and what can happen to psychiatrists and their patients when they bend the rules."
3,Maybe I won't lie on this couch...,"I started this book eagerly, as I found another book by this author, Nietzsche Wept, to be fascinating. This book is less so. Those in therapy (or training to be a therapist), might gobble up this admittedly well-written and witty discourse on unraveling the mind.Unfortunately, the all too human minds of the therapists in this book claim to be able to dissect any other mind, but they are still baffled by the liers currently on their couches and get themselves snared in a rather elementary soap opera like plot.Perhaps these therapists should remember to heal themselves first."
5,"Big pleasure, entertaining and much to learn","I really think that by reading this and other novels written by Yalom you can learn a lot of psychology, and what makes a good psychologist, what is essential to help someone. And apart from this Yalom is an excellent writer, has very intresting and exciting plots, it is a pleasure tp read his books."

5,Every Woman's Book by Paavo Airola,"This is a great reference for women of all ages, who are interested in alternative medicine. From pregnancy to menopause and everything in between."
3,Broadway Business Industry,"This is a great book if you're interested in the Broadway Business Industry. I was more looking for tips on how to write a Broadway Musical, Character development etc... So this was not what I was looking for. The description and reviews were not that specific about this. Everybody was mostly raving about the writer, who I think, is brilliant when you're ready to get out there and shop your play around."
5,The BEST OF ITS KIND (and I can't put it down!),"Unless asked, I never give advice. I am making one exception: this book. Get it. Read it. Re-read it. Study it. Memorize it, if you can.Spencer's insights and ""hands-on"" experinces as a musical theatrewriter are intelligent, funny, honest and, I find, inspiring.How can one book expertly guide you through EVERY aspect of the musical theatre writing process? I don't know how he did it, but he did. This book, in my opinion, is the best of its kind.My only warning is -- you might not put this book down and, if you have a tendency to highlight insightful and useful passages, you might find you have highlighted the entire book."
5,A stunning account of real life in Nazi Germany.,Brings to reality what life in Nazi Germany was like through the eyes of a Hitler Youth. One of the best book I've ever read. Hard to put down.
5,wanna reduce stress?,Life's changes? Times change! Try a different way to deal with life? This series provides endless tools for happiness.
4,Dance of Intimacy,"It's a great book that encourages women to appreciate the self, improve their self-esteem and be more alert of their individual needs in conjuction with their relationships."
4,The Dance of Intimacy,"This book is thoroughly informative and sometimes hard to read because for a self-help book it can really stir you up, especially if you have a distant relationship with your family of origin. It was very helpful to read case studies about other women's lives that are parallel to mine. Sometimes, as a topic hit home, I put the book down for a day or two. Thinking about the subject and opening a discussion with my siblings has helped me to gain insight into my current relationship. Good book to read if you are ready to look at yourself."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"Having heard a lot of positive things about this book, this author, and her series, I had high expectations when I began reading The Dance of Intimacy. What disappointed me was that the book is a series of case studies, with little practical advise. I expected information on the dynamics of intimate relationships; what makes them work, what causes problems in them, and how to know if the only thing left for you to do is terminate that relationship. While there were a few interesting stories in the book, I did not find what I was looking for. Instead, I highly recommend Steven Carter and Julia Sokol's He's Scared She's Scared for a more comprehensive look at people who have difficulty with intimate relationsihps and commitment."
4,some good insight,"This is a book that does provide some good insight into the 'distancer' and the 'pursuer' that the author discusses in relationships, that being, the one that wants more closeness, and the one that wants more space. On that the book is helpful so that you can better understand the dynamics of a relationship. If you like studying relationships in general, this is a good book to read. If you are looking to make significant positive changes in your life and in your relationship, I suggest getting this book along with ""Stop Being the String Along"" by Barbara Rose. I feel that both books provide valuable, even life changing insight."
4,Great book!,This book is very insightful and applicable to just about everyone. I'm very glad I bought it and will be buying more of Dr. Lerner's books again in the future.
3,Guide For Ushers and Greeters,"One needs to know that this book was written by a Catholic priest. Most of the book pertains to Roman Catholic liturgy and has little that is applicable to the evangelical church beyond that which is intuitive anyway. If the buyer is from an evangelical background, he will likely be disappointed. So if you are Roman Catholic, this book might interest you. If you are not Catholic, look elsewhere."
5,A Great Book!!,This is a wonderful book. A great read with incredible facts and a lyrical view. Deborah Cramer brings real journalism to the story of the Atlantic.
3,not supremely helpful,"I got this for my daughter when she was about 21 months old & expressing heightened interest in potty learning. She delights in helping Elmo drink from his sippy cup but also thoroughly enjoys watching Elmo fail to get to the potty in time & have an accident. In 3 months, it hasn't helped her make any progress at all. The books, like ""Big Girls Use the Potty"" are much more helpful."
3,Elmo,"You don't need this toy...I would not buy it again, even though my wife and I had more fun with it than did the kids."
5,We LOVE Potty Elmo!,"After some initial trouble getting it out of ""store mode"" and into ""normal play mode"" (we had to reinsert the plastic tab and pull it out again a couple of times), we have really had GREAT success with this toy! I have 27 month old twin girls. The first one trained herself at 23 months, and we have been working with the other one on and off since then. She is a HUGE Elmo fan, so when I saw this toy, I HAD to get it! We have had it a few days now, and I am happy to say that teaching Elmo to use the potty has taught my daughter to use the potty! I used this toy, along with a potty training book, and new Elmo Panties as a reward, and it really worked!The only thing that is a bit tricky for my daughter is when Elmo asks for a drink, you have to trigger a button type thing in his mouth with the cup, and a lot of the time she missed it and I had to help her. But, that was minor. He is SO CUTE and so much fun!"
3,Fun introduction,"I was hoping my son would want to go potty just like Elmo but instead he just love Putting ELMO on the potty (and giving him ""water"") Too much fun for its own good! However it did give our son something to start the process of potty training. (he could see what Elmo does, it gave him the basic idea of going potty etc)"
4,"Elmo, Potty training","My toddler was going through the potty training phase when I ordered this, and amazingly, she was potty trained within a week, two days before I got the Elmo doll. But, she still loves to play with him. It is a really cool toy. It knows when he is sitting on the potty and when he is not. I think I like to play with it too.Good durable toy, child friendly, even soft enough to sleep with."
4,Review of Elmo Potty,I received the product in record time and was pleased with it. It was a gift for my grandson.
1,Seriously?,"This item costs 329 dollars?!?!?!?!?! Are they serious? What makes it so fantastic that it would cost any more than 40 bucks, max???"
3,A fun toy... and that is all it was,"My son likes playing with this doll but it is not a *clear* representation of how going potty works. My son realized you could get Elmo to drink by just sticking his finger in his mouth and pushing the button. Then when Elmo goes potty, he will say ""oops"" and has an accident unless his butt is all the way on top of the toilet, so even when it appears he is on it he still has an accident. If you have hard floors you will need to let them play with it on a rug so the toilet does not slide across the floor when the child tries to put Elmo on it. I kept this toy because it is still a fun toy and my son likes to put his other stuffed animals on the potty, but as for teaching him potty training it did not work for us. (We also have the Elmo Potty training video and the video is more educational)"
5,Potty Elmo is the cutest thing,I think this is a great product - it makes me laugh and it helps our grandaughter with her potty training. I am so glad I purchased it.
1,This is such a crappy toy...,i dont like it... responses are delayed... i just dont like it ... it doesnt even sound like elmo... my son got this toy yesterday he is 18 mon. and he already figured out that there is a button in elmo's mouth to press and thats how he gets to gulp... there goes the feeding cup... he doesnt use the feeding cup to feed elmo... he is more fascinated with pressing the button himself with his finger...o well thats a loss...
4,The Elmo Experience,"We've enjoyed Potty Time Elmo at our house. He seems to have piqued our daughter's interest in learning to use the potty. Mercifully, his cup does not actually fill with liquid, and there is no ""end product"" to deal with. You may, however, feed Elmo from any cup, as he only requires that you push the switch in his mouth when he is thirsty. I enjoy that he doesn't become too dispondent when he has an accident (if you don't get him to the potty on time). He can play an important support rol in potty training."
3,Disappointing Elmo,"Approaching potty training time, we thought this would be an ideal aid for our son...a huge Elmo fan. It's not as educational as the packaging and Editor's review indicate. My son lost interest in the ""potty training"" aspect of it almost immediately and instead prefers to play with it just as a doll. I thought you could add water to the sippie cup, assumed the potty would be more realistic and the interaction between child and Elmo would be much more inviting and fun. Quite honestly, we've had better luck with other potty training books and videos. Try again, Elmo! We still have faith."
3,Not so good for potty training,"I bought this toy for my daughter because she loves Elmo and I thought it would help us with potty training. My daughter started training early (16 months) and I found this toy more confusing to her then helpful. A few examples - everytime she heard the word potty, she would want to go and sit on the potty even if she didn't have to go. (and Elmo says it a lot) - One time she tried to sit on and go in the small toy potty that comes with Elmo. Too confusing for early trainers."
3,Fun Toy,"My daughter loves Elmo and we use him as a role model for other behaviors (""Elmo always uses his manners!"" ""Elmo brushes his teeth every day!"") and that has always worked for my (not quite) two year old daughter. However, this toy was seen as just that--a toy. She has not shown any interest in the potty in relation to this toy. I guess that just goes to show you that they'll only do it when it's their idea! ;)"
3,"Potty Elmo, cute but ineffective if you expect potty training results","My daughter immediately loved Elmo, the potty and zippy cup have been gathering dust. She found the button in his mouth that makes Elmo drink and presses it by hand and she does not think it a problem at all when Elmo does not go in the potty, she just likes that he talks. I think Elmo is adorable, and I am glad my daughter loves him, but if you expect this Elmo to really help your child with potty training think again, it did not work for us :)"
3,Great Idea....But not for my Son,My 2yr. old son had fun for the first two days. I was like cool this might work. Then the next day I noticed that he would not let Elmo go to the potty. He was laughing at Elmo every time he had an accident. Then after 1 week he lost interest in the toy.
3,Really Cute!,I bought this for my cousin who turned two not too long ago. He's just started potty training. He absolutely loved this! Elmo has his own little newspaper and everything!
2,Not your typical Elmo,"This one doesn't dance or sing, it does talk a bit but is also more of a stuffed animal than the previously released hard robotic types. IMPORTANT TO KNOW: ELMO DOES NOT REALLY GO POTTY AND DOES NOT REALLY DRINK ANYTHING. We bought the doll for our niece hoping it would help her go potty- it didn't. And instead was thrown in the toy box for the more fun dancing and singing Elmo. Also as a side note, the accessories that come with Elmo are cheap made and easily lost. Once again a toy that costs just as much as the other better Elmo dolls."
4,Potty Elmo,"I had purchased this item for my 2 yr old niece who is IN LOVE with Elmo. She immediately took the the doll and toilet included and now walks around saying "" Elmo needs to go potty Mommy"". Hopefully this tool will assist my sister in her efforts to potty train her daughter."
3,An early work by Kerouac,"It's been years since I've read something by Kerouac, but I was excited when I first learned of this new book, a previously unpublished novella written in 1944; I did not expect it to be a work of high literature, but it was what I had hoped for: a represenation of Kerouac's literary early development. Over all, the writing is somewhat awkward, the plot and premise vague and esotiric, yet at the same time it exudes some of the freshness and intensity that would make his later works--On the Road, in particular--so popular. Naturally it is a must read for any Kerouac junkie, but those not so familiar with his writing will find it interesting as well."
4,Very good.,"Though I don't consider this as good as Pocketful of Paradise, this was very good. Containing all of the same wonderful ingredients as the first. I have never cared about characters in a book as much as I have the characters created by Kathleen Kane. She is a wonderful writer and I would highly recommend her books."
4,the first monograph of Sloan,"My copy is very old and dusty it is full of vital information on John Sloan. The author writes well and authority. He is sympathetic to Sloan and his work.A more recent study of Sloan is a better book. This book deals with the subject his wives and his circle .The scholar of the ash can school and Sloan will need to read this book. I like to read about the radical artist: the search for truth and credibility is in this biographry.Todays artists have no interest in the artist struggle to relate to society. There is no relationship , products are produced to give the buyer exclusive,...exalted status .."" Look at me I am rich I can afford this and to hell with the lower classes."" Sloan helped to nurture many artists. Stuart Davis is now considered a major artist. Sloan paid more than a small role in the encouragement of Davis."
3,A good summer read about a 90's type woman & her family,"LK paints a compelling tale of just how fragmented American families can become. However, she also facinates us with her characterizations and beautiful description of the Northwest. Her novels continue to have strong females and quirky situations. My favorite remains ""Beggars & Choosers"""
3,"Touching, funny (and surprisingly deep)","Through the tale of the aging hippie matriarch Celia and her complex family tree of exes (and their current spouses) and steps(children), this book ends up examining love (mostly healthy love for one's self, for one's children, for one's spouse) and the wrongful turns one may take while searching for it.The writing is vivid and one does get a feeling of somehow 'being there', a silent witness to a tragic-comic and often touching and deep series of family and personal discoveries.I was somewhat disappointed at what I found to be a predictable late turn of events and a predictable ending, but it did not detract from the enjoyable reading."
3,Arab for beginners,"A book to learn Arabic. It is composed for some lessons where the student learn the pronunciation, writing and grammatical structures. The course is divided in two steps; the first one is passive where the student has to repeat and understand, and the other one is active where the student will start making his own phrases and conversations."
3,A Decent Attempt,"Well, the first week I had this album I loved it. Every minute of it's sad lyrics and slurred melodies. And then it hit me: what a boring record. I mean how many times can you moan and complain about your past girl friends screwing you over. I mean a couple times, sure, but a full length CD? I think not. This is for the depressed and lonely. So if you qualify, knock your socks off, otherwise: STEER CLEAR!"
3,McPhee on Red Bull,"This book would be twice as good if it were half as long. Evidently the only editors were fawning friends of the author, who must have felt that every observation, no matter how offhand or trivial, needed to be included in the bloated text. This is too bad, because he is a decent writer, knows and cares about fish and fisheries, and the story is compelling. Imagine John McPhee full of Red Bull and vodka and you get the idea.Also, a book that uses the silly word ""waitron"" without irony, and ""heregia"" twice in a hundred pages can be a little precious."
2,Intellectually Dishonest and tells a biased story.,Carl Safina has omitted much material that would reveal the half truths in this book. There is no doubt that the oceans are stressed but to hide facts that refute the calamitous state that Safina would have us believe is the only truth is dis-honest.Two years prior to publication of this book the National Academy of Sciences refuted the Biology of the NMFS scientists with regard to the stock assessment of Bluefin Tuna and agreed with the industry that the recovery has proceeded beyond NMFS belief.
5,share & care alley,"An excellent piece of work. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, especially to seminary students.Purchase it, you will not regret it."
3,Not Her Best Shot,"Now revered for her live vocal dexterity & passionate showcases, this album does not reflect the true electricity of Benatar's stage presence - for that catch her new DVT or indeed the 1983 DVD release Live! From New Haven. The audibility of this album is not the best & sound mixing brings instruments to the fore too much, hence sometimes over-shadowing Benatar's raucous voice. What the cd is worthy for however is the inclusion of Promises In The Dark (not on the live! DVD) & 2 new offerings - the instantaneous classik Love Is A Battlefield & a saccharine pop-type song called Lipstick Lies - even as a die-hard fan I find this one quite hard to stomach. It would have been nice if this album had been the entire show on cd as a momento of the tour - rather, snippets here & there do not give the oomph which reflects a real night on the town with her royalness, Pat Benatar"
4,will this album be remastered ?,"Does anyone know if there are plans to remaster this album - as far as I am concerned, Pat Benatar's album discography ends with this album. I just purchased In the Heat of the Night, Crimes of Passion, and Precious Time (finally as individually remastered albums) but I am still waiting on Get Nervous and Live from Earth. You may note that the listing here on Amazon for Get Nervous says remastered but the album specs still put a release date of October 25, 1990 so I am not going to purchase it until that is cleared up. I realize that there are those ""pairs"" of Benatar remastered albums but I am a purist. I had all of these Pat Benatar albums on vinyl as a kid (first LP my Dad ever bought for me was Crimes of Passion) and want the individual equivalents on CD (but with the remastered sound quality). I'd appreciate anyone with knowledge on these remastering issues."
1,Just say no to Slim-fast low carb shakes,I am currently on a Slim-fast diet and found it better than expected in taming my appetite. In the process of tasting the different kind of shakes I bought one pack of the creamy chocolate low carb. It offers more protein than any other of their shakes. BOY WAS THAT EVER A MISTAKE! As soon as I get through typing this I am throwing the rest of the pack in the trash. I could not discern the taste of chocolate & the aftertaste is really yucky.The Slim-fast high protein shake has a little less protein but worth the difference in taste.
3,"Good research/concepts, could be 1/2 length...","I came across this book because it was referenced in one of my college textbooks. I have a degree in small group communications. The concepts in this book are good and have very useful application in any corporation. However, the authors really could have rehashed each of the points fewer times and it would have only been better. At several points while reading I was disappointed to realize that I had already read the same thing, in some cases, three times before. I literally said after reading the book, ""It makes you wonder whether the publisher encouraged the repetition because, ""Hey, 320 pages cost the same as 160, so why not?"""" With that being said, again, the book is useful. Just keep in mind that you may find yourself skipping pages at several points."
2,Did you know they have Quick Book College!,"This is perfect for a small business to keep track of virtually everything! From sales taxes to inventory, customers to vendors...you can keep track of it all! It's start up interview makes it so easy to use that anyone can be successful with the set up process.Well, I give up! I spoke too soon! I just found out there is a ""Quick Book College"" and believe me when I say you need a master's degree from there to do this right! I have a buisness degree & with this it is useless!"
3,Like the new version ONCE you get it installed,"I have liked the new version of Quickbooks once we got the program installed which took some doing. We had problems with it getting almost installed and then it would roll back. When we finally solved the roll back problem, the installation would appear complete but then we could not get in to the program. We had to do some switching on and off with the network and Internet Explorer 7 but eventually were successful."
4,It's OK...,"QuickBooks is a wonderful program that I have used in my business for several years. I have been using 2004 edition and once you upgrade, you can't go back to the older version as it changes all the files. Although there are some new items that I like, 2007 drags. It takes forever for files to recalculate. I know there has already been an update downloaded to my computer so hopefully they are working out the kinks."
5,Beyond Great!!!,"This is the biggest time saver EVER! All those reports, you usually have to pay an accountant huge dollars and wait a week for, you have instatly for what your software cost you."
1,Works fine but not on all PC's,"Had to install it on 2 different PC's wouldn't work on my laptop, on which quicbooks 2006 and 2005 works fine!The problem is well known, but no solution offered.Once it works, everything is as good as always. Would have given them 3 more stars if I would be able to install ths software on any PC I want to."
1,I absolutely hate this product and company...,"I downloaded their $99 version recently. Two hours and 5 phone calls later I found out that my new version was not compatible with my old Quickbook files. These details were cleverly hidden away on their web site. Of course, when I complained the sales person and her manager were more than ready to sell me the right version for twice the price.As for the software, I absolutely hate it. It was designed by myopic accountants who have never run a normal business. It's designed for your accountant not for you. Also be prepared to get inundated with advertisements for additional services that are designed to frighten you into buying one monthly subscription after another. Before you know it, you'll have sunk several thousand dollars with these clowns and have little to show for it.I'm still with them because of my accountant. If you don't have the same restriction as I do, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,I so hate this program,"I just got off the phone with Quickbooks Support after I was told I HAD TO buy the tech support subscription in order to get the program I bought last year to work.This constitutes a breach of contract, and is an extremely dirty business tactic. I paid for a product that I am unable to use until I buy a service agreement.I am a CPA and have about 10 versions of Quickbooks on my computer but I will discourage anyone from using Quickbooks from now on.If you make the best product, you don't have to resort to dirty tactics such as this to get people to buy your product.This is simply unabashed greed."
3,"Quickbooks gets slower, includes ads","This version (2007) starts up, opens windows and changes windows much slower than previous versions. Everything is oriented to HTML type pages such as the ""home page"", the ""customers page"", etc. Pages switch with noticeable delay on a fairly recent, powerful computer.Also, I do not appreciate non-removable advertising for ""Google Marketing Tools"" and ads for add-on (additional fee) services from Intuit on the otherwise useful ""home page"" in software which I paid for.The accounting functions are improved and more intuitive but the trade-off is as mentioned above."
3,Financial accounting OK - Mgmt accounting needs work,"It's not too hard these days to find a financial accounting program that does the basics. Problem is, a lot of people don't understand what the basics mean. Intuit needs to put a major upgrade into the reporting capabilities of QuickBooks, and if they don't want to spend the time then they should bundle Crystal Reports with it, as Peachtree does.I have stayed with QB for quite some time due to its easy data entry, but I'm really disappointed with the lack of reporting improvements. If you don't have an accounting software application, but you do have some accounting training, go with Peachtree. If you do not understand accounting, buy QuickBooks and hire a CPA."
3,Hostage Upgrade,"I can not write a positive review of software that is upgraded because the previous version (2004) was sunseted after only 3 years. I find Quickbooks unimpressive but useful. I do not like the pervasive intrusions to buy other of the vendors ""upgrades"". I need simple accounting software. I can see that any continuing relationship with Quickbooks will be tenuous at best. My accountant wants me to convert to Peachtree but I will continue to use this software until the next sunset."
3,No Fixes from 04 and PONDEROUS,The 'USE REGISTER' toolbar button still doesn't do anything. I had to install RAM to run the app. No more tax rate downloads; it's PAY PAY all the way. Invoice data entry lines are the smallest part of the screen. Why?Why did I upgrade again?
1,They Lied!,"I just opened a consignment shop and needed the software to take care of retail as well as keeping track of what I owe my vendors. This software is about the worst I've seen. It is set up only for companies such as construction where you have big jobs. I need something I can easily put in daily sales, that can easily keep track of sales tax, and that can easily print out what I owe to my vendros twice a month. When I talked to their customer service before purchasing the product they said it was set up to do all this and yet it does none of it. I just talked to another rep and she said it wasn't a problem to have to go to each vendor and customerize the report I need, twice a month, for every vendor. Not a problem for her maybe but I have better things to do. This software is useless!"
3,"Great product overall, but ""upgrade"" causes issues","Our company has used Quickbooks for years and appreciate the benefits of having all of our records in one place. One highly significant problem, however, is the fact that Quickbooks 2007 does not support Linux servers, which has not been a problem in previous years. We have a server so we can share the main file and back up our information daily, but this version forces us to network our computers directly and save it to a hard drive. I've talked with support during the 30-day free support period, and while they are very sorry, they reiterate that they do not support Linux servers and that this change is part of an important security upgrade for this version. If I had known that this was so much ""better"" than previous versions, I would have stayed with my tried and true 2006 version."
1,Beware QB if you don't use an old computer!!! It is RETARDED,"I have used Quickbooks for 15 years. I invoice my customers by emailing invoices. I just bought an HP laptop with Core 2 Duo processor, and installed QB Pro 2007 on it.The emailing-invoices feature will not work, and I was told in a support call that this feature is not supported on a 64bit processor.There is no notification on the box or elsewhere that the product is, in effect, a beta version, that does not work and is not supported on the most modern Intel CPUs!UN-freakin-believable!"
4,Also Buy Tutorial,"This is a fine bookeeping system for any small business. But to avoid total confusion, you need to buy the tutorial ""Learning Quick Books"" software as well. The extra forty bucks will save you hours of frustration and help you get superior use out of Quickbooks itself."
4,Owner,"I upgraded from the 2003 version with no major problems. The 2007 version is a bit easier to use and works just fine for my small business. The security, however, is not great for a mid-sized company. Since my accountant fully supports the product, they are always available for support."
4,quickbooks,this is a program I have used a lot and really like the ease with which I can use this for my business
1,Not QUICK at all!,"Didn't like it at all, at first. Hard to do. Does not make it ""Quick"" to enter income and expenses! Is not built to suit my business. I would have designed it differently. After months of making do with the built in categories---which make no sense for my business, but I use them anyway--- it's become a tolerable tool. It's still a bugger to get the kind of reports I need, and still don't know how to sort out particular product sales so I can pay commissions and royalties.I used Quicken for many years, and that was pretty good. The only thing missing was a way to track product sold. I am a manufacturer of products I sell. I do not send invoices, as people pre-pay for the paper dolls and books they order either online or by catalogue. There is a lot of rigamarole to do to get around their set-in-stone system, in order to make it work -marginally-for my needs. Judy M Johnson, paper doll artist, publisher. [...]"
3,Quickbooks 2007 harder to use,"The overall setup and layout is horrible. They laid out the main page to be so simple that you cannot change it, and it makes it very hard to utilize other functions such as the printing, notes, to-do items, loan manager, etc, etc. If it is not on the main page, then good luck in finding it. Overall this version stinks. There are a few upgrades that are nice, but none that really make that much of a difference."
2,Made for Vista????????,"This release does not work with Vista unless you place your company files EXACTLY where they want you to (in the Public directory - what's with that?). The printing function does not work with an HP printer until you parse through about 6 - 8 modal error boxes - EVERY time. The program does not remember the type of checks you have (like other releases did). The Pay Employees screen only works when it is maximized - otherwise the ""Continue"" button is not available. All-in-all it is amazingly buggy. Wait to purchase this release until the bugs are worked out!"
1,Thank you all who have written a review! You have probably,"saved me from making a serious financial mistake. I was ready to order this product for the first time, but after reading ""all"" of the reviews, I felt I'd just been saved from giving away my money. The ""beta testers"" not withstanding their excellent reviews, the lack of tech support, the dropping of advertising on to the system, the constant forced upgrades with costs, my little business that is growing rapidly does not need this down-swing. My only hope is other potential buyers research this product extensively and can come up with an alternative. Thanks QuickBooks, but no thanks."
2,Payroll feature can't be used for jobs outside of the United States,"I specifically needed this software for payroll. I had a headache trying to work with a program that used US tax tables and other US deductions which don't apply in countries outside of the United States. The online support did their best to assist me by suggesting I do most of my work in Excel and export it. That defeats the whole purpose of having the software to make my life easier!! So unless I move to a US State or am in a country with the same deductions I can't use the software. Its a pity because I did really enjoy the other aspects of the product. Let's hope that an ""International"" version is created."
4,Quickbooks ro 2007 Small Business Software,"This software was an update for me, since I had been using the 2003 version for a few years. It was an easy adjustment, and seamlessly transferred the information over from the previous version. I have only been using for about 1 week so far, and my only complaint is the time it takes to load, and especially to back up the file, compared to the 2003 version."
4,Quickbooks always a bonus,"Been a buyer of Quickbooks since 2003. Always a pleasure to work with and the new start page makes finding stuff alot easier. Wish the online subscription wasn't so expensive for us little businesses, but love the payroll options. Very impressed with new invoice methods, loan manager is basically the same but there wasn't anything to improve on. Don't know how you can make it any better."
4,QuickBooks Pro 2007,"Has a lot of nice features that weren't available in 2001 version. Easier to use, prints statements of just open invoices, prints payments made to clients, for example. I like the product. Sorry I didnt get it sooner."
1,Unable to upgrade from QB 2004 Pro,"We have a rather large file that we've been using with QB 2004 Pro for quite a while now. Payroll support is going away for 2004, so we were basically forced to upgrade to 2007. What a mistake!After three weeks of on and off attempts to convert our data file, and five calls to Intuit ""support"", we finally gave up and are returning QB 2007 for a refund.I have no idea what we are going to do next, but I was unimpressed with the poor quality and general attitude of the Intuit support staff, and am more than a little miffed that Intuit is taking away payroll support for a product that works fine (QB 2004) and trying to force me to ""upgrade"" to a product that doesn't work!"
2,Won't someone create better bookkeeping software?,"I was forced to purchase this software because Intuit decided to disable some of the necessary features in the 2005 Basic version of QuickBooks I use at my business. 2005 Basic fit my needs very well and I was offended that I was forced to upgrade so soon after purchase, and that Intuit no longer offers a ""Basic"" package.Upon installation, QB Pro 2007 immediately slowed my computer to a crawl whenever it was open, and even after a couple of months, still occasionally bugs me to buy Intuit products. Sure it does what it is supposed to do, but there are so many other software packages that add and subtract.If you are making your first purchase of book keeping software, do yourself a favor and explore alternatives to joining this cult. Intuit has no respect for their customers and will bleed you any chance they get."
2,Accountant,"I have been using Intuit Products for many years in our accounting practice. Each time we have upgraded to the latest Quickbooks ( Pro Versions )we notice that the program is sluggish, slow to load and function. The Pro 2007 version is extremely slow and we have PC hardware that is fairly new (XP pro). As an accountant, I do not need all the ""window dressing"" interface menu screens that I believe slow down this very capable program. Too bad Intuit does not offer an accountant's version that has a cut and dry interface ( pull down menus as previous versions, eg 2002) and is speedy to operate."
3,QuickBooks Pro 2007 Sm Business,"While the newest QuickBooks Pro works well, and has a good Help service, it still does not allow ""cleaning up"" of old inventory. We have used QuickBooks for over 6 years to handle the financial part of our safety supply commerce website. Our inventory has made some major changes in the thousands of items we have carried. We have dropped hundreds of items but we cannot delete them, even after several years. In other areas, QuickBooks fits our needs well."
2,Diminishing value / Poor customer service,Quickbooks standard payroll software is 199.00 but they removed the ability to print the 941s and 940s unless you pay an additional 100.00Want to buy online? it says 199 but charges 299.00 and the fine print they automaticly charge your credit card anually.Call customer service - got put on hold for 1/4 hour then they dropped the call.Too bad the original people sold the company.
3,Okay but slow,"This software is very slow, some improvements but still needs more. Improvements not equal to the slow response . Intuit really needs to work on it. Questions with Vista wether it will work or not, but that was resolved."
2,"clunky, ugly, bloated but it works","Still a pain to use. Slow to open, the timer (which they finally updated) is still slow. The interface is still fugly and the new ""home page"" looks like a flowchart and is allegedly customizable, but who the heck has time for that? I had trouble finding stuff I use all the time. And I wish I could have two invoices open at the same time, it would make things so much easier. Costs too much and provides very little guidance on how to set up your accounts (if it's for the non-bookkeepers around us, make it clear what we're supposed to do: what's the difference between a fee, a sale, and a service rendered??) When I find software that's easier to use (and stops trying to sell me stuff) that imports my 9 years of QB data, I am so done with QB."
1,Major dissapointment,"I have a relatively simple business. I'm an independent distributor of health products. I buy from the manufacturer and recieve a discount (set precent always) but pay tax and handling fee (also a set percentage). My sales maybe at full price (plus the applicable tax and handling) or I can give varying degrees of discount up to my own discount value (so I don't make or loose money on the transaction).I need to know my inventory at the cost level. I have to prepare taxes for 2006 also. I'm unable to use this software at all. I entered all my products - several hundred, but am unable to create the inventory or record my sales with the special discount. This software was a complete flop."
2,It takes over your computer.,"I'm a professional and have purchased QuickBooks versions every year since 2002, and additional years prior to 2002. That said, the 2007 version has an entirely different front-end design which one has to get used to. But more importantly, I suspect this new version interferes with the operation of XP Profesessional on my computer. I'm not an IT guy, but that's my take.I resent software which installs user IDs on a computer and modifies the computer's normal operation. I've only used the software briefly for one client, but I know this...my computer will not shut down normally. I now have to click ""turn off"" twice. And when I boot up, I now have to select myself as user because QB2007 installed a user for itself.Sometimes developers should just leave well enough alone. I can't wait to uninstall this thing."
5,Great for Business,This is a great accounting software for personal and business. I use it for business and have done so for years. Every release gets better.
5,excellent changes-easy to use,"THIS NEW 2007 QUICK BOOK PRO IS EXCELLENT AND GREATLY IMPROVED FROM THE PAST FEW YEARS. I AM NOT A PROFICIENT USER AS I HAVE NOT USED THIS PROGRAM FOR SOME TIME BUT, THIS ONE SURE MADE IT EASIER TO USE AND NAVIGATE.FIRST TIME USER OR REPEAT USER, IT IS A GREAT OFFICE/HOME TOOL AND MUCH NEEDED PROGRAM FOR TODAYS RECORD KEEPING AND IRS REPORTS."
4,Basic accounting systems,"This is an ugrade for us. We had hoped that some of the upgrade would be more robust. Looks prettier, but not a lot of substance."
1,Not Stable on Vista,This product has a known issue with Vista that Intuit has not successfully resolved (according to Intuit's technical support team). My entire accounting system just crashed and the file had to be shipped to Intuit's data recovery team with an ETA of 2 weeks. I'd think twice. I can't allow two weeks to go buy without being able to pay a vendor or generate an invoice. I should note that I have done backups every day and those files also were not recoverable without expert assistance and the 2 week turnaround. BUYER BEWARE.
3,New version not as good as previous one. Few improvements.,"This new version of QuickBooks PRO is not as good as the previous one that I owned. The new interface is boasted as better organized. However, once you get past it, confusion ensues. I found the new payroll steps very confusing. Payroll items appear differently for each employee; they don't stay in order as you go from window to window. A/R still can't give you a payment history for customers.Beware: Intuit stops supporting payroll updates periodically so that you MUST upgrade. That's why I bought this dog! If my CPA weren't committed to this product, I would have changed to Peachtree."
1,Stops working after 30 days!,I was shocked to find that my purchased software stopped working after 30 days. They force you to register by calling in.If you don't you can't use the program. If you are offended by forced registration - don't purchase this software.
3,Upgrade not always an improvement,"Recently upgraded to 2007 from 2004. Any improvements are truly minimal while the speed slowdown is a real problem. From moving from screen to screen to backing up data in particular, this is now a very cumbersome process / product. If you are working with an earlier version successfully, stay with it."
4,Accounting Intuit,"It's pretty good, there are some things that I don't like for example the help files. Sometimes you have to enter data multiple times to make it do what you want."
3,Barf...,I was in charge of billing for an organization and they used QuickBooks so I got myself a copy. Talk about convoluted and difficult... I think I spent an entire week trying to figure out how to use this software.
3,"Software OK, but Documentation poor","As far as the software goes it tracks your small business activities fine. The problem is that the program is hard to work with and hard to find your way through. The documentation and help menu's are poor at best. For the price of this software, Intuit should provide the documentation manual with the software, not expect you to buy it separately. You would expect them to be better at documentation than this."
1,QuickBooks PRO 2007 small business financial software,"I wish I still had QuickBooks Pro 2006. it was easier to use. Also since we installed PRO 2007, I have had a number of problems with my payroll and check registers. My accountant is coming next week to try to fix everything. It was like my computer said ""no, don't do this to me"". Dates got mixed up (showed dates past January), check registers (I have 4) were mixed up; one had parts missing, can't reconcile another because data changed - everything was fine until I made this change. I'm blaming these problems on the Pro 2007 because everything was fine until this was installed. Maybe it could be a computer glitch too but who knows . . ."
2,Memory HOG! Why make life complicated?,"After being notified that QBooks would no longer be supporting my 2004 version for payroll updates, I had to upgrade and purchased the 2007 version. I have a business with 6 employees. I do my own payroll but rely on QBooks for taxes and withholding.The software seems to work fine; but I sure don't need all the bells and whistles. And I don't care to have such a large backup file. Backing up used to take about 20 seconds. Now you may as well go down the hall, get a cup of coffee, and chit chat for a while.There needs to be a simple version for the small business owner. And the company needs to offer payroll support for more than 2 years. That is the part that really chaps me. I shouldn't have to buy expensive new software almost every year."
2,Lost features if you don't use Payroll Service,"To reiterate what others have said: if you use QB to do manual payroll, it will no longer generate your payroll tax reports for you -- you MUST subscribe to their payroll service. Period.On the positive side, if you already subscribe and love QB's payroll service, you will probably find no issues here. And ... they do give you 30 days free call-back support too, which is helpful, as you just may find yourself using it. :)"
3,QuickBooks Pro 2007 - Marginal Upgrade,"We had been using QB 2004 Pro for several years. When Intuit threatened to withdraw all support for the product in March of 2007, we decided to upgrade. The new version has a few convenience features (that have been in Quicken for years) like remembering the account a particular bill goes to, but in general it's just a very expensive cosmetic upgrade. I wish the company would quit trying to force a new product out every year, and put one out when they've really got an improvement."
2,time consuming and difficult at best,"I have had to un-install and reinstall three times and it still won't update on a very current Windows XP version. I hate how hard it is to download from my bank and it never recognizes the stuff anyway so I have to go through line by line and create aliases. I like Quicken better but the accountant can't figure out how to import Quicken into his Quickbooks Pro so here it is. Hate it, hard as ever not easier, the whole thing takes way too long to work with. Reports are a bit easier which is good or I would have tossed it out the window and bought Microsoft Money."
1,Greedy corp!,"I just got the 2006 version 6 months ago, and just purchased a new Vista computer. They sent this BS email a few months back saying ""2006 won't work with Vista"". Basically I had no choice but to upgrade after error after error popped up in Vista (especially when using plugins).Furthermore, there isn't even an ""upgrade"". Why must I buy a full version EVERY time I want a new version. Even MS lets you properly upgrade Windows, and there are MANY more changes in an OS than in a 1-yr old piece of acctg. software. Even the toolbar is chock-full of advertisements for other products. I feel like I'm using a trial version even though I just paid $200 for this thing.Not even the '07 interface has changed. I feel ripped off and stuck in a corner. MS: ""Please produce a decent piece of acctg. software so I can ditch QB!"""
1,Worst software I ever tried to install,"I spent 3 hrs. on the phone with tech support and another 4 or 5 on my own trying to install on a stand-alone computer. It finally installed, but now I get a 39056 error code, and the program won't load. The fix posted on Intuit's forum doesn't work. I've reinstalled with no success. Tech support is clueless. And because I purchased the software thru my college, I can't get a refund. I thought this would be perfect software to assist me with my accounting degree. Boy, was I ever wrong! Run, don't walk, away from this horrible product."
1,They stink,Costumer service is a complete oxymoron with this company. If you want to waste half your time then buy this for sure. Pencil and paper work better than this product and are more reliable.
3,Slower than older version,"Since I've upgraded to the 2007 version, the files got bigger, the program runs slower, Back-up takes longer and too many updates."
2,Search the help topics in Quickbooks instead,"Save yourself the money, this doesnt give any more insight than the quickbooks help pages."
3,Bedbugz,"Well, this item worked but I was not comforable that my child wouldn't fall out of bed. It was hard to get blown up really full and still moved quite a bit even when strapped in tightly because the strap streatches too much. I ended up putting it further into the mattress because I was affraid my child would roll under it."
1,What an utter piece of crap.,"I know Halloween costumes are supposed to be cheap, but come on! For the price, I could have bought a real dress. This thing was ugly, scratchy and of awful quality. I couldn't even stand to wear it for the duration of the Halloween party I went to. Luckily, I was wearing something under it. Don't waste your money."
3,Smooth and Shiny,"Good product and all that, the only downside is that I can't use right after shaving, made my poor head itch like crazy. Granted I have sensitive skin, but that being said, this is the only lotion I've used that's caused great itching following a shave."
5,25 Years Ago...,"...when I was a young parent, I bought this book and it was extremely helpful to me. With a new baby, it's hard to know sometimes if the illnesses and symptoms kids get are really dangerous. This book is packed with information about illnesses and conditions, plus, it gives you an easy method of determining whether or not your child needs to see the doctor. I'm going to buy a copy for my ""children"" now, so that they can use it for my grandchildren!"
1,"poor quality glue backing, no quality control","TOPS 3x5 memo pads, these pads have all fallen apart, glue backing does not adhere to paper, poor quality glue, all I have now is a big mess of white 3x5 pieces of paper and some cardboard, not at all what I ordered, extremely disappointed, no quality control in review or shipping process by the company for this product."
3,Great for kids!,I bought these when Amazon had them on sale for 5.99. For that price they were a great deal! I keep them in my purse for my daughter to color on when we are in restaurants or for lists/notes. My only issue with them is that they fall apart pretty easily so I usually have lots of loose paper floating around.
4,Simple and Great.,I'm constantly looking for something to write notes down on. I'm still a pen and pad kind of guy. I've always got some of these on me. The real love I have for these is for mind mapping and outlining. A pad of these and a cork board helps me effectively develop ideas. If you're still a tactile kind of person like myself - get 'em.
5,"A touching, funny, and powerful book","I'm on my third copy of this book now, having lost my two others to careless borrowers. Alegria's ability to combine prose and poetry, personal insights and political and social commentary, and sadness and laughter is extraordinary. You don't need to know Salvadoran politics to enter into the experiences of a girl and woman changed forever by the society she lives in, and to relate to them."
3,great design but not a great quality clock,"This is a pretty expensive item, but it doesn't feel like it. the spokes are aluminum and kinda flimsy. The clock itself doesn't even have a glass covering it; it's hard plastic.It does look nice on the wall though and adds some design to a big boring looking wall."
3,Crazy Legs by Jeff Beck and the Big Town Playboys,"I love Jeff Beck and I have bought almost everything he has put out, but this album did not really do it for me. Maybe because the second time I listened to it was after listening to the Stray Cats' Rumble in Brixton live CD. Brian Setzer makes rockabilly fun and exciting to listen to. Crazy Legs is well done and Jeff Beck's playing is excellent (as usual), but maybe it is too perfect. It just seems to lack energy and excitement. That said, if you are a guitar player and/or love Jeff Beck, then buy it anyway because it does show how well he can play a different style than you might be used to hearing him play."
5,Indeed!,"Creating the best guitar albums ever such as You Had It Coming and Blow by Blow, there's no doubt that Jeff Beck's the god of guitar. And with Crazy Legs, Jeff shows us that he can do not only techno (Who Else and You Had It Coming), not only fusion (Blow by Blow, Wired, and There and Back), not only powerful trios (BBA and Guitar Shop), but he can also do rockabilly. And there's no doubt about it, this CD's good.Now, I was a little reluctant to buy a rockabilly album, it's really not my type of music. But it was Jeff Beck, so what the heck? Sure, I listen to this CD, and I'm not really fond of rockabilly. But it's the talent on this CD that allows me to like it, the talents from both Jeff and the Big Town Playboys. There's no way you can say there's no effort or talent on this CD."
1,Take it or leave it? LEAVE it!,"I have followed Jeff's career since the Yardbirds, and I have almost everything I can find by him BUT, after I bought this cd, I recycled it. Yes, it's decent rockabilly, which may be an oxymoron in itself. Obviously, it's not my favorite genre, although I do like Brian Setzer and Danny Gatton, but I DON'T miss this cd. If you can buy it cheap, give it a try."
2,Is this it?,The rap side of Rockabilly. In other words it all sounds the same and becomes tedious. Guitar Shop had some innovation and feeling to it. Crazy Legs is just not up to snuff and reflects his lack of meaningful direction. Beck needs to get back on the edge of Fusion. A genre that has been sorely missed in the Rock and Roll world.
2,boring,"All of these authors, seem to be sitting around and writing the same things, only with different charcters. Didn't like this book at all, would not reccommend it. ""REFUND"""
5,Very Interesting,"I enjoyed reading this book and the characters were very entertaining.Other great books I've read: Coldest Winter Ever, Changes by S. D. Lewis, Bad Girlz"
3,Ok,"Busted and DisgustedGood story with a lot of drama. Cream was a stripper with a drug dealing boyfriend that started sleeping with her so-called bestfriend. Need I say more, read the story and watch the drama unfold.Southern ComfortI didn't like it and I took away a star just because of the way it portrayed New York City. I am not down with dissing the Big Apple, my Big Apple.PlayedAngel got played big time but you knew what was going to happen when you began reading the story. The story was good, but very predictable.Later!!!!"
2,so- so,I'm not going to lie my personal favorite is southern comfort. the first story okay but at a certain point it started dragging.I suggest you borrow this book from a friend than going to actually buy one.
2,OK,"I thought this book was OK. It could have been alot better. I didn't think the stories were all that interesting. I only finished it because I don't like starting a book and not finishing it. The last story was the best to me. The other two just seemed rushed and unrealistic. They also stated that these chicks lived in Crown Heights. I'm from the Heights born and raised and nothing was mentioned (street or land mark, nothing even a Chicken spot would have been a little more realistic) and these girls didn't speak like chicks from around the way ""eee, cack off"" anyone from around the way can interpret that, 1."
1,Disappointing,"The texts used in this book are exclusively from the English background. A title like 'Reading Medieval Latin from English Sources' is more appropriate. As I expected something of wider interest, this was disappointing."
1,Disappointed,I had a video tape of this title and really wanted a DVD copy of it. I was hoping for a better quality picture than this has. It just looks like someone took the tape and made very poor copies of the movie.
3,"Vacuum unit works great, but accessories not so well.","Vacuum unit works great, but accessories do not fit well. Also if you use the micro cleaning attachment, the vacuum gets very hot."
2,Disappointed,"The company that shipped the product was great and I received it within a few days of order, but I was disappointed with the product because all 6 watches that I needed to size had average size bands and not one of them were small enough to use this tool. This tool is for very small bands...I purchased a different tool from a different company for $3 and was able to size my watches with no problem."
3,"""Eh""","The reason I gave this book only a 3 is because there wasn't that much adventure or climbing. The author basically spent the whole book shooting holes the Annapurna book by Maurice Herzog. I appreciated the truth, but wasn't my taste in books."
2,Interesting but.....,"If this book had been edited into a New Yorker Magazine style feature article, it would have been a fascinating re-examination of an adventure classic. A thin book at best, certain axes were honed almost into butter knives. While Herzog's tale inspired a generation of post war readers, the incidents investigated here were no more enlightening than those in Kraukaur(sp?) or Bokorev's verions of 1996's nightmare on Mt Everest. The author might have also toned down his own climbs and summits, but then the book would have been even more woefully brief. It was extremely interesting to read the follow ups on the other Anapurna climbers, and I suspect that their likes are amongst us still, but now enabled a bit with cell phones, topo maps, modern equipment, and helicoptor evacuations."
1,Atonishingly badly written book,"The book is not true to its (sub)title. ""What really happened after the legendary ascent and all the gossip"" would be much closer to its contents.As much as I was interested in the lives of members of the expedition, I had to force myself to go through clumsy, over-gallicized language and juicy details, unrelated to the subject. Why, pray, should one read about somebody's breasts being looked at after a car accident?My advice is to go through the bibliography at the end, and to follow writings of the expedition members."
3,Oral Fixation Mints,"The best feature of these mints is the provocative name; great at social events. Design on package also attracts attention. However, these mints have a very mild peppermint flavor; not even remotely as strong as Altoids."
4,One of the ultimate Live Ska collections!,"If you love ska and need a great way to liven up the party, then get this disc and let it rip! Live classics from some of the best artists in the category. A must have for any true ska fan!Lip up fatty!"
5,lost jem from the 70's,"ALIVE! was an icon of the ""women's music scene"" in the bay area in the 70's. While that world did give them a very supportive fan base and among the most responsive audiences anywhere anytime, it also secluded them in a nitch world. This was the loss of jazz fans everywhere.ALIVE! was the real deal a terrific band that could drive hard, as on the title track Call it Jazz, or be very soft and subtly lovely, as on Step By Step. Rhiannon a tremendous front woman, is on fire throughout. Always at her best in front of a live audience, she is perhaps at her peak here. The scat on the opener Call It Jazz is classic Rhiannon. The opener Call It Jazz also highlights the pianist Janet Small, who remains sadly rarely heard from since those days. A special nod must also go to percussionist Carloyn Brandy who lends so many textures to the events that were live performance by ALIVE!."
4,delightful sampling,"This strong tome provides readers with a delightful sampling of some of the winning shorts and novellas over the last thirty years. The collection is balanced as four entries represent the 1970s; six from the 1980s; five from the 1990s; and three from the 2000s. The contributors are a who's who of the two genres (not surprising since this prestigious award is selected by a vote of Locus magazine readers) to include greats like Harlan Ellison, George R.R. Martin, Neil Gaiman, Gene Wolfe and Ursula K. Le Guin, etc. Each selection is well written, but some of the tales, surprisingly especially from the 1990s, feel dated; incredibly, the seventies and eighties hold up quite well and besides a bit of nostalgia remain terrific entries. Readers, especially those of the magazine, will appreciate the eighteen selections that make up ""thirty years of the best in science fiction and fantasy"".Harriet Klausner"
5,An easy to read overview and review for everyone,"Upon first receiving this book, I was skeptical that it would be another over the top book written about networks, servers, and hardware that did not make a connection to the intended audience. BOY WAS I WRONG! Aaron and team have done a tremendous job of breaking a difficult language down to simplicity! I work with thousands of churches in my ministry and I highly recommend this book to each of them. It does not matter if you are a novice or savvy user of technology, everyone will benefit from 40 Days and 40 Bytes. I would wish you enjoyment in your reading, but that is a given!"
3,PRICE ????????????,Very interesting that the book price on the jacket is $26.00 U.S. and $35.00 Canada and the priceshere go up to $60.00 and used versions are selling at the price of a new book.
4,Proving that Bush 2 was not a conservative,Length:: 0:55 MinsI am Douglas Wolf the author ofMarketing Me Book: How to keep your job in any economy. I have been a political activist since the early 1980's when I worked for a Republican Congressman from Minnesota. Bartlett convincingly makes the case that Bush was no conservative.
4,An Unhappy Economist,"Unhappy is an understatement. He's steamed. As if there weren't enough Bush 43 haters already! Here's Bruce Bartlett, major heavyweight economist, a guy with a resume so solid you could blast it with phasers and they'd just bounce off, speaking out in no uncertain terms.The only fault I had with this book is that the author sees things narrowly. When you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When you're an economist, everything looks like money. Not totally, but there's a perceptible bias.Considering it only as a critique of how our 43rd president has done on the economy, I've no complaint."
4,Well written critical summary of the G.W. Bush Years,"This book by a Reagan insider reveals in stark detail Bush's hipocracy in using the conservative title. Bartlett shows him as an grandiose opportunist who believes he is guided by God, and making all the errors of judgement that stem from such absurd overconfidence."
