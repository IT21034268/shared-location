1,What I received is not what was advertised!,"BEWARE - Bait and Switch Ad!!!!The ad clearly stated a tube of the scratch removal product and 10 cloths to apply it with. I received the tube, but no cloths. When I contacted the seller, their first response was that their ad did not state the cloths were included. When I replied with the excerpt from their own ad, they said sorry, they didn't have them anymore.No refund, no offer to substitue another product, no satisfied customer.I will not purchase from this seller again."
1,tooth powder works better than DISPLEX,minor scratches may be taken out with too much rubbing and the surface is made translucent...not to good if you are trying to view the time on your cell phone...I used tooth powder to clean up what Displex did
1,Will never deal with the vendor again,I will never buy anything from this vendor again. Poor service and late delivery of the product.
2,Its not magic,"If you are expecting to hide an accidental scratch to buy some time, you might not want to try this because it did not work over here."
1,Did not come with cotton cloth,"This product did NOT come with the cotton cloth as advertised. According to previous reviews, it looks like they used to include it. If this is no longer the case, please make a note of that in the description, or buyer beware that you may or may not receive what you were promised."
2,Looks Clearer / Still Scratched,I got this for my Samsung Galaxy S3 because of very shallow pocket scratches on the edges that seemed to be getting worse. First thing I noticed was that it made the screen look worse! If that happens for you don't fret. I think it was just showing how dirty the screen was with oil from my fingers. After rubbing for about 10 minutes that filmy cloudy look rubbed away to a beautiful clear screen. But it did NOT remove or make the scratches less evident.As far as a polishing agent goes it works. As far as a scratch remover it does not. I don't recommend it based on that fact.
2,"nope,.","removes some smaller scratches, but not the big ones and also removes the nice smooth finish for a nasty rough one that is easily smudged."
1,No help for my BlackBerry,"I have a BlackBerry Curve that I use for work. Yes, I know I'm the only person on Earth who still uses a BlackBerry. Anyway, my phone screen got pretty scratched up after just a few weeks of use. I used this scratch remover -- I actually did several coats of it -- and did not see any improvement in the scratches. Zero success. I'm just going to have to live with the scratches."
2,Didn't work,Didn't work on nexus one phone but since it states not for touch screens I can't complain. The reason for only 2 stars is that it made my screen look worse than before
1,It Doesn't work,"I have bought this product for my Z9 phone. I went to Florida and scratched the LCD in a few places.I have applied the polish, and the scratches are still there. There isn't much else to say."
1,Didn't help..,I ordered this in hopes to remove some scratches on my new phone but the product didn't help at all. The scratches still show. It was a waste of money.
1,A Difficult Way to Learn Business English,"On the positive side, ""Let's Speak Business English"" is a concise phrasebook for the business English student. However, the language is often unnatural and the exercises provide very little practice for effectively learning the expressions."
2,JUST FOR THE BONUS DVD,Remixed versions of owned tracks is not a big deal...but the bonus DVD is why I bought this cd pack. The bonus DVD has little content but is nice as Peter Gabriel appear on one of the videos and the 5.1 remixed version is fine too. But nothing else.
5,Real Good!!!,"I'm Spinning Instructor and I need music for push people to ride, Pod is perfect for that.....I'm very happy and I recomend other album from them, ""ANATOMIC"", fantastic too."
4,Get Up and Dance,"If you are sitting still through this CD, alert the undertakers. This a great collection of remixes that suffers only 2 boring cuts: tracks 6 & 7. They represent the only 2 tracks that Emerson or McNally wasn't supervising the re-mix guys, and the result is that plodding sameness that is so utterly annoying about techno and trance and all that stuff for greasy kids. The rest of it is great fun. The bonus DVD gives you 2 music videos and some footage from ACSC at WOMAD, well worth the admission price all by itself. If you are a fan, there is nothing new on this, but it still is brilliant craic!"
4,An amazing cd & dvd set,"An excellent set of remixes with dvd extras from an absolutely superb group of musicians. Be sure to check into their albums -- Seed, Further in Time (aka Vol. 3), Release (2), & Sound Magic (1). You will not be disappointed."
2,Ironic...,"Actually, as a Christian, you should see such a book as a compelling reason to convert to atheism, for didn't Jesus say:""If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you. - Luke 17:6See, if it takes more faith to be an atheist than a Christian, and faith is the only way to God and heaven, wouldn't it be your most intellegent action to convert to an antheist?"
1,I Don't Have Enough Faith to Believe Geisler & Turek,"Although Geisler & Turek correctly acknowledge the primacy of reason over faith, their book betrays reason. The book is full of half-truths and deception. The authors indulge in false dichotomy, false analogy, strawmen, faulty logic, equivocation, and other fallacies. I can support my position, but it would take more space than I have here. To see my expose of this book, enter ""I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be a Christian, by Kyle Williams"" in your web browser."
3,Interesting book,I thought this book was very interesting but it seemed to be very impersonal. It often read like stero instructions.
5,Great apologetics primer.,"If you only have time to read one book on apologetics, this is the one to read.While every chapter in this book could be expanded into its own full volume, this serves as a tremendous introduction to apologetics and does a great job of building a systematic framework for examining faith in light of scientific and historical evidence. This book will not change the heart of the unsaved, only the work of the Holy Spirit can do that, but if you are sincerely open to faith, or want to know that your faith is grounded in reason, then this is a great place to start.I do not agree 100% with everything Frank and Norm say in this book, but then I probably don't agree 100% with anybody.... :)I used this for several years as the foundation of my apologetics class with teens, and it serves that purpose very well. I have also given it as a gift to graduating seniors and pray that it will reinforce their faith."
4,A thinking persons book,This is a good book if you want to find out how you relate to the supreme being. You don't have to have any affiliation with organized religion to appreciate this book. It is not light reading.
4,Perfect for the skeptic,"This book puts forth a logical argument for faith in God. Many skeptics are disenchanted because they have not gotten their questions answered. This book provides both answers and reasons. The truth is that we will not get all our questions answered in this lifetime, it is not possible. God is God and we are not. Some reviewers have jumped on the authors about their treatment of evolution. The authors aren't scientists but they certainly don't have a ""gross misunderstanding"" of science & evolution. Faith in God and macro-evolution are exclusive, you cannot have both. To say that you can is an indication thay you do not understand either theology or modern day macro-evolution."
1,Funny,"I read this book hopeing to find new things, but I did not same old thing. How Atheists need God and how Atheists need faith (as you can see from the title.) so all in all I did not like it."
1,Totally Unconvincing,"I am an agonostic, and would be happy to read a convincing book, but this is just unconvincing fundamentalism. Oh well."
1,Matthew 17:20,I've found that Christians don't have enough faith to move mountains either -- or even small stones.
1,Stunned by na've approach to biblical literature,"The chapter on the New Testament is stunningly innocent of the huge, detailed findings of biblical criticism. It sets up the same old false trichotomies in ways that should not impress adult readers. That it does is a real worry, as it has its strongest influence in the world's most powerful nation.Oh dear.Also, the title is incredibly misleading. No faith at all is needed to be an atheist - it is the default position. The burden of proof is on claims for the existence of something so complex and improbable as a God."
2,"Should be titled ""I have enough faith, but need a few weak logical arguments""","In an age where Science is slowly dismantling religion's justification for reality, there need to be some works that Christians can reach for to show that they are justified in their implausible beliefs. Frank and Norm really argue a great case for absolute truth in this book. They set the stage for a knock out blow only to fall short of proving that it takes ""more faith to be an atheist"". It is a good read and has some nifty metaphors that can be used by anyone as parlor tricks in apologetics, but I found the case they made for Christianity to be incredibly thin, based largely on speculation, and lacking any real evidence.A christian who reads this book will love it and rave about it so I do recommend it for Christians. A person with wavering faith, an atheist, or a skeptic will not find this book helpful.Based on it having been recommended to me to increase my faith I have to score it low."
1,An extraordinarily weak case,"This book was recommended to me by a Christian who had very silly ideas about atheism. I accepted to read it if he would read Sam Harris. I held my end of the bargain, very painfully, but he didn't, unsurprisingly. All the arguments in there are extraordinarily weak and absolutely unoriginal. The writing is extremely bland. Its most striking feature is the smugness of the authors, who seem very convinced of their own cleverness. Unfortunately for them, the whole enterprise is doomed by their own ignorance and bigotry. If you are looking for new arguments for religious faith, this is not where you'll find them. It will only convince people who are already believers."
1,A confusion of contingent and non contingent faith,"This book is a collection of 100-times-refuted arguments, mainly cosmological and anthropological arguments to ignorance. The author then makes the blunder of confusing theistic, or non contingent faith (belief without any justification) for contingent faith - or rational assumptions supported by real world results.Anyone who finds themselves impressed with this book ought to look into studying logic and the basics of critical thinking."
5,Easy to follow!,"This is an apologist volume that has plenty of meat, but, still easy enough for us lay people or even one unfamiliar with the Bible to understand. I recommend this book as a strong basis to begin discussions and for it's emphasis on logic."
2,"Does not prove that the christian ""God"" is the creator of the universe","When one considers that the deity worshipped by the followers of all three of the occidental religions wasn't the first god or the only god. Even if the scientific evidence leads to a sentient creator, it need not be anthropomorphic, Christian, Jewish, or whatever. As far as I am concerned, all religions and their gods are the creations of man."
1,Do not recommend!,"I never received this book, nor did I receive any response back from the owner. My daughter had a book report and we had to scurry to find another book elsewhere! I was very disappointed...."
5,I don't have enough FAITH to be an ATHEIST!,"Great book. I loaned my copy out to someone that questioned a lot but wasn't an atheist. It has answers only a dedicated atheist could deny. Its all factual. Love thsi book. If any Christian has friends that are doubters or constantly have questions regarding Christ and His coming, living, dying and arising, here is solid answers."
5,Excellent,Hard but great read. For believers and non-believers. Great give for those who like to learn.This is a keeper for my library
3,Misleading Format description,This audio book is described asa a MP3 AND Audio CD but apparently comes in as MP3 only! I do not have any CD player capable of playing MP3's so now I have to convert the MP3 to an audio file... Did not find the software yet. I am disapointed!
2,Looking for the truth amidst the smoke,"Geisler's argument for a Creator typify the stuff I am becoming increasingly frustrated about. He misstates scientific principles, draws on irrelevant or invalid scientific evidence, and uses ridicule of the theory of Evolution to convince his readers of God's Creative act.He then pulls together a rather complete summary of the current arguments for faith in Christ, which are probably as merited as any. But his abuse of science can only serve to invalidate his subsequent arguments."
5,A to Z analysis of faith systems,"Excellent book-length ""tract"" that addresses a myriad of theories and worldviews and leads the reader to realize that Christianity is the only worldview that makes sense and that it takes more faith to believe the other worldviews than it does to believe in the Bible and the God of the Bible.I have given the book to friends who are evangelistic, to atheists, and to everything in between. It fits everyone.The book also contains information for reference to answer 'thorny' spiritual questions."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an AtheistGreat Book! Great shipping.
5,Brilliant!,Dr. Geisler did a brilliant job with this book. He makes a case for the evidence with clear structure and minimal ambiguity! I would challenge more Christians to read this book to gain a strong foundation in apologetic and biblical worldview.
1,No winner in these pages,"I am underwhelmed by the author's story. It seems to me, by the anecdotes offered, that the author was looking for someone to tell him what to believe rather than to challenge him to think it out for himself. In the end, the author chose to follow those who absolved him of being responsible for his own opinion.And the idea that it takes more faith to be atheist than it does to be a believer is about as ignorant as any idea I've ever heard. Someone please give a dictionary to those who buy into that idea so that they can look up the word 'faith'."
4,Excellent read,This is required reading for my daughter's 10th grade bible class but I couldn't help taking a peak. Its well written and draws the reader in. It is written in language more appropriate for adults. It is certainly a challenge for my 16 year old who is used to reading more text messages than real language.
5,AMAZING BOOK!,"I am a seventh grade student and I am a Christian. I go to public school so naturally I'm taught that Evolution and Atheism are science and that Christianity is religion. Well after reading this book, I mustered up the courage to speak to my science teacher after class and using the stuff in the book, I totally won the argument we had. I have read plenty of books that prove Evolution wrong, and they are all good, but they all pale in comparison to this book. A must read for anyone who wants proof that Christianity is true and Evolution/Atheism is not."
5,I don't have enough faith to be an athiest,"This is the best book on Apologetics I have ever read! Logical, understandable, comprehensive, and even humorous, it addresses modern issues and shows how reasonable Christianity really is. And after reading this book I don't have enough faith to be an athiest either!! I know that i'm going to order ten more of them!"
5,Great Book!,"Yes, I've read the other reviews, and I'm sure you have too. So, I'll keep this short. This is a great book for anyone (believer or not) interested in exploring both sides of the theist/atheist debate."
2,Nor do you have enough reason,"A christian friend of mine recently lent me this to read, knowing well my atheist position. Perhaps he thought it would ""turn"" me. Sorry, no such luck. It starts out ok then rapidly degenerates into the same old claptrap. If anyone thinks there's any half-decent science in here, they're sadly mistaken. They even contradict the bible in a few places! The book is full of unbacked assertions and glaring non-sequiturs. The authors paint their assertions with a thin veneer of reason that is easily seen through if you're thinking. This book actually does more damage to christianity than it does good.I found a great rebuttal (search the 'net for ""I don't have enough faith to be a christian""), which is so good I wish I had written it myself.For someone seeking some truth about evolution I would recommend Daniel Dennett's ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"" and on Christian origins I would recommend Bart Ehrman's ""Lost Christianities"".Nothing to see here folks, move along."
5,"Awesome book, very well written, an easy read and keeps your attention!!","This is a very well written book, flows great, a ton of great information and ways to look at bringing across a debate to Atheist in a constructive manner. I like that the authors use information and debates from other Aplogists (like Ravi Zacharias). It is very interesting, easy to read and thought provoking. I would recommend to anyone that desires to gain more information in this area to read this book."
5,I dont want to believe,"Dont forget that Dr. Geisler and Josh Mcdowell have never lost a debate.It's easy to ""try"" to refute the authors when they cant hear you....Go ahead organize a debate with them, if none of the so called ""top athiests"" cant debunk them what makes you think you can. Oh yeah, dont bother trying to debate me go ahead and contact the authors.Outstanding book couldnt put it down."
5,"Beautiful, inspiring, unusual book","I love The Art of the Pressed Plant. The authors mine the history, the science and the art of preserved plants in thisrich book. It was fascinating to learn about the people who have collected plants throughout history, what that meant, and what that was like for them. It was inspiring and surprising to see the beautiful specimens. You will not be disappointed if you get this book."
3,Good!,"I really liked this book. I do not read a lot of historical setting books, but this one was good. I liked how they were childhood friends and then it grew. The mystery of who killed their parents was fairly easy to figure out. But the characters personal relationships keep the story going."
2,ok but not great book,"I've read other Andrea Kane books and they were so much better than this one. The characters were kind of 'blah'. They aren't very interesting. Brandi ""Sunbeam"", I disliked. Her character was very immature. She thought and acted like a child in the book. Quentin was the type of guy that was to good to be true.He had no annoying traits at all. Which made him bland. This could have been a good book if the characters had more depth."
5,Killer Toy!!!,"This pair of fellas come armed to the gills! Be careful, can pose a hazard for young children with all the sword items."
4,Pretty Cool,I bought this for my nephew for Xmas and I was suprised these thisngs were actually pretty big GI Joe's. Lots of weapons that came with it. THose are pretty big too and stiff plastic so I'd watch out with little kids I think they could easily hurt themselves with them. But as long as youth or natural selection doesn't factor in your kids should be fine.
4,la guera dice,"Intocable-- como empezar con algo tan bonito y talentoso? No hay forma de esplicar Intocable! La cancion ""Suena"" es maravilloso!! Escuchalo y te lo aseguro que no te repentes!!"
5,the coolest,this is the coolest toy around right now. i just bought my astrojax a few days ago and i am already masterin tricks. there are thousands of tricks to do wit these things and they are so addicting. buy one!
1,Jackson attacking is brilliant; Lee doing same is stupid,"The title of this review sums up Bevin Alexander's view of the operations of the Army of Northern Virginia, and as such, reeks of a disturbingly flawed thesis. Further, for Alexander to claim that it was Jackson and not Lee who was the genius behind the Confederacy's one successful army, is simply to state what cannot be supported by facts. What, in fact, made Jackson so effective was that his vision of war messed perfectly with Lee's...a simple analysis that escapes Alexander and his totally agenda-driven ""history."" For these simple reasons, this book is of little value. For those wanting to read a good history of Jackson, Frank Vandiver's MIGHTY STONEWALL is still among the best."
5,My Review,"This is a great book from a different perspective on the Civil War on a little known general whom made big news and is in my opion the greatest tactician of his time. Alexander did a great job with this book.This is one of my favorite books, too."
1,NOT GOOD,IT IS MADE OF CHEAP PLASTIC NOT EVEN WORTH SENDING IT BACK TO THE SELLER IT BROKE THE FIRST SECOND IN USE AFTER HOOKING IT UP AND REROUTING ALL MY AIR LINES THE FIRST TWIST OF THE AIR CONTROL SCREW AND IT BROKE SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET THE METAL ONE
3,Too Easy,"I love the Reader Rabbit series and this falls short of those games. This is simple and ok for 3 to 4 year olds for a little while. The thinking behind this is pretty simplistic, but little ones can still enjoy it."
4,The Force is Strong in This One.,"Volume 5 of ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" is now available. If you think that Ben Tennyson has problems before, then get this. Four new to DVD episodes involve a tiny Upgrade-like creature named Ship and Ben gets busted by his parents when they discover him as Swampfire ! Also, Ben teams up with Grandpa Max as they enter the Null Void to defeat an old enemy.A cool special feature is a sneak peek of the new ""Ben 10 Alien Swarm"" movie as seen on Cartoon Network. The movie is also out on DVD presently. But don't forget to look for more new episodes on TV as well as on DVD."
3,an interesting and revealing account of a woman's struggle w,"This was an interesting and revealing account of one woman's struggle with, and recovery from bulimia. The book is repetitive by its nature -- she describes her compulsive binging and purging from the time she was a young teenager to a young woman. However, while autobiographical, many of the stories/anecdotes she included were unnecessary or irrelevant, weighing the reader down with the feeling of, ""Haven't I read this before?"" or ""Who cares?"" All in all, though, this is an insightful book about the nature and pain of addiction, and one that gives much-needed inspiration and hope about the possibility of recovery."
4,Definate read,"What an amazing book, I read it last summer and its contents are still with me.Caroline is amazingly honest and open about her experiences, a recommendation for anyone, particularly those who struggle to understand eating disorders."
5,Eating disorder,This book is an autobiographical account of the author's personal struggle with bulimia; a very interesting read & is very real in terms of how she got help & sought to help others later on
3,Cheap and works well for my 160 LED Light.,"I have 4 of these batteries they are fairly worth having. I use them on my 160 Led light for my canon 60D. I just feel like it takes long to charge. I wish they had a multi-battery charger for it, like four. Other than that they last pretty long."
5,Surprisingly Good,"I didn't want to spend $60 for a Sony battery, so I gambled on this aftermarket battery. I tell you what though, it held a larger charge then the comparable Sony battery and my Sony HVR-HD1000U recognized it and displayed charge level with no problem. Haven't had it very long, so I don't know of it's quality over time and/or repeated charging, but so far so good. Also, I think it only cost $6-7, so that's much cheaper then Sony..."
5,If you read one book on leadership make it this one!!!,"Dr. Fair has written THE book on leadership in the church. This book should be read BEFORE John Maxwell, George Barna, Rick Warren or Bill Hybles because it has more useful information on each page."
1,Terrible design.,"This tape dispenser (model ST-181) has a terrible design; no matter what size package you try to use it on, the tape will not tear off the roll without Herculean effort...the directions tell you to raise up the clear plastic shield if you want to tear the tape off manually...this requires more than 2 hands! I am going back to my 20-yr-old dispenser; this one is nothing but pure frustration. Very disappointing from 3M/Scotch Tape."
1,Piece of Junk: SCAM!,"This thing is a total waste of money. Thanks in part to some 'safety cutting edge', it is almost impossible to cut the tape without having the tape get all bunched up or come loose off the dispenser. I ended up having to use a scissors to cut the tape, which flies counter to the whole point of having a tape dispenser role. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! PS: After I threw out this piece of junk, I bought this: 3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenser (H180). It works just fine."
1,What a nightmare!,"I used my trusty 3M Gray tape gun for at least 10 years until some packers accidentally took it when I was helping my mom move. I sell on eBay so I needed a new one quick, and I picked this one up because it was all the local megastore had. What a disaster!! That safety thing is totally ridiculous. I have toddlers in my home and I just keep the thing away from them! Maybe if you're new to tape guns and you don't use them often you can work with this. But if you're accustomed to the 3M one, or want to move quickly when you pack, forget this piece of junk. Thank goodness Amazon sells my old one, I'm going to overnight it right away!"
3,Brings the first two novels together.,"The characters from Arena and Whispering Woods (the first two MTG novels) are brought together in this book. Noreen (Garth's Benalian lover from the first book) plays an important role here, having an affair with Gull before finally getting back with Garth... While this one reads a little too much like a soap opera for me, there are still some of the gory and tragic incidents that make the MTG books worth reading.The evolution of Gull's army into a real fighting force and Greensleeve's training as a master druid are cool aspects of this book (although the appearance of Chanel the druid was not explained at all).Overall, I wasn't too impressed by this one but I will continue reading the series."
3,Whispering Woods,"Not the best Magic novel that I've ever read, that's for sure. The book was entertaining, for the actual tie ins to the game. However, the characters didn't really develop that much, and frankly, the plot was poor. It's too bad really - I think the story could have had real potential. But - it was an entertaining book, even though poorly developed."
3,"I liked the ""special appearances""","I was about to put the book back on my bookshelf when I read the chapter where some of the characters of Arena appeared. I liked this, because it gives a sense of continuity in a series. As for the rest, well... I am not sure where the story is going."
5,A play like no other!,"This is not only a masterpiece of dramaturgy but moreover Louis Nowra's greatest work to date! With a seemingly simple story Nowra resonates a unique understanding of the human condition that leaves the reader paralyzed with emotion.Much like the film, this play is an Australian treasure!"
5,Seasons of Life,"Based on experiences and reflections of a young woman growing into adulthood, this is an honest and poignant work. A must read for poetry lovers of all ages."
5,Fun and different,"My son really seems to like this toy. I think that he thought it would be a bit more intuitive to use...that he would be able to just *do* alot of the tricks right off. When he first got it, it took a little while to get the hang of it, the feel of it.I was watching him and he seemed a bit ....stumped....at first. Like he really thought it would be a bit more yo-yo like, or something. The instructions come with very little in the way of hints and tricks... they should as this is a different type of toy. That said, there is a website with this kind of thing.He has had it for a while though and is enjoying it now. I would suggest this especially for older children. Rarely are truly *new* toys put out on the market so this is a worthwhile new addition."
5,The best toy ever!!!!!,"I got this toy a half a year ago and it is soooo fun!!! I've never broken mine, but if you drop them enough....they will. THIS MAKES A VERY GOOD PRESENT!!!!! GET IT FOR EVERYONE!!!!!"
1,Defective and must be returned,"This item was originally working correctly, but then became defective after a couple weeks of use. It must be returned."
5,Working well,"Up to now, it is working well....I'm happy and service was so good that I received what i was looking for!!!Thanks"
1,Mislabeled Ram,"Ordered a 2 GB stick of Kingston PC3200 Ram, it came promptly. It was labeled as ordered, but at installation it posted as 1GB. I installed it in another computer, not mine but someone else's and it again posted as a 1GB stick I will not use this seller or Amazon ever again. Also as seen it was supposed to be 2x 1GB sticks."
2,delivery problem,"Amazon is not honest with its inventory status. I placed an order because it said it has this item in stock. I received an email a week later telling me the item is not available and they had to delay my order. My shipment order in the account, however, is set to 'In Transit'. I have used Amazon very often, but this time, Amazon has disappointed me big."
1,I NEVER REceveid My Memorey,I never Recived this item and have been trying to get a hold of u guys for over a month now but nobody has answered my e-mails I could probably give u a review if U would just send me my Memorey
3,"Decent RAM, worked as advertised.","The RAM arrived without issue and worked fine. My only complaint is that it's very expensive, especially for DDR1 RAM and only being 1 gig worth."
4,ValueRAM 1GB 400MHZ DDR PC3200,"Price is average. Delivery is fast and easy. We did save a little bit by ordering online. Not the best price around, but it does what it supposed to do."
3,I'ts not what I expect from Kingston product...,"By this time I still can't use both memory dimm, if I try to use both of them, my system recognize it and work ok about one or two minutes, then reboot over and over, although Kingston's web page tell me before I pruchased this two memory kit, that it will be fully compatible and the best option for my computer upgrade....and I'm still waiting for a response for them for what can I do to fix the problem......"
2,"fast delivery, bad memory","This was delivered just a little over 24 hours after I ordered online. So it was fast and I was happy to receive it so quickly. Unfortunately I spent the better half of the evening trying to get my computer up and running after it shut down several times because apparently, it is not compatible as they said it would be or the memory is defective. I have experience with installing memory and always following instructions, doing exactly as it says, reading labels checking for compatibility but as of right now I am very disappointed in this product. It does not work for my computer."
1,Did not recieve this,I did not recieve what I ordered.I got a movie instead of my kington memory.and I am really upset.
1,Bad product description,"This kit misleads you into thinking it is one 2GB stick, when in actuality it is two 1GB sticks. Also, it is advertised as DDR while the sticks that were delivered were DDR2 and thus totally incompatible for my uses. What a waste of time and money."
5,GREAT PERFORMANCE,"I WAS USING 2 GB BY CRUCIAL AND I GET ANOTHER PC THAT NEED MEMORY, SO I GET 2 GB KINGSTON AND LOOKS BETTER THAN THE OTHER EVEN WITH SLOWER PROCESSOR, SO I DECIDE TO EXCHANGE THE OTHER CRUCIAL BY KINGSTON, THEN I GET KIND OF NEW PC, BUT THIS TIME 2.GREAT PERFORMANCE !!!SO F.....N HAPPY :)"
5,Affordable Upgrade!,"My computers response time had degraded and I thought it was time for a new purchase. After researching alternatives my son suggested this 2GB KIT. Ez installation, affordable, and has far exceeded our expectations!"
1,Don't work correctly,"The Kingston RAM 1 GB 400MHz PC3200 DDR DIMM Desktop Memory, after work almost 5 minutes, just reset the computer.I wasted my money."
5,Excellent compatibility,"HPs are notorious for compatibility issues, but this module slot right in without a problem. I already had 512MB and this 1GB raised the total to 1.5GB.Highly recommended. Put into HP A450Y Desktop."
4,Good Quality,I am not much of a 5 star person yet maybe this should. The RAM has been in the computer for a month running 24 hours with no problems.
5,great value,I have an older desktop and this worked like a dream. only had 512 so I ordered another to make it 2 gig. seller was very fast on delivery and packaged wonderfully.
4,It works great,"The memory fit great and works without a hitch. There is nothing negative to report on this product, and I would tell others to purchase this kingston valueram without hesitation."
5,ValueRAM - more bang for your bucks,"RAM is RAM is RAM...thats what some people say. There is some truth to that statement. ok, so RAM is a utilitarian item that we all need and cant do without. But how much do you need to spend for utilitarian items ????If you look at the RAM market, there are all kinds of prices for basically the same thing. How much you want to spend is up to you; but why pay more than you have to ??? If you want to pay Rolls Royce money for a Subaru, thats your choice. I'd rather pay for what I'm getting, and not more for some BIG name. ValueRAM is value for your bucks, it's also made by Kingston. It is what it is, with no hype to get you to spend more than its worth. Its your money, why give it away ???"
5,The best memory around,"As always, my kingston memory has been flawless, it's the only memory that I would use in my PC."
1,IT CRASHED MY SYSTEM!,"Perhaps I just got a bad one but on installing it, my system crashed. Took it out, everything loaded fine. Re-installed it > everything crashed again > returned it."
4,Worked fine for Vista upgrade,"I used this kit to update an HP dc7100 dual core desktop from 512 to 2.5GB. This made a world of difference running Vista SP1. For those of you out there contemplating installing Vista SP1 on a 3-4 y/o desktop, you will need much more ram than with Win XP, but it does work OK. Newegg was cheaper by $7.00 though."
4,Good value for the money,Kingston value memory(pc3200 400mhz DDR2) should work in all but the most demanding situations. I am using this memory in a server that runs 24/7. So if it's good there it should work anywhere. Product was delivered quickly and on time as promised. I would by here again.
4,Great Purchase,The price was right and it arrived in a timely manner. it was just what i needed to give my aging computer a boost
2,Not the best potty,"I really liked the way this potty looked, so I bought it for my daughter. I waited a week for it and was so excited when it finally got here and that was the end of my good thoughts. The height ring kept falling off everytime we moved the potty and so did the grippers. The grippers just stick on the bottom and the potty just sits on the height ring. The back compartment slid off if you tried to pick it up and the interior shelf was bent. Also, the top to the ""tank"" compartment was bent and didn't sit on the back of the potty well. The free liners seemed more like a hammock that would not do a good job of catching the potty. I quickly took it back apart and returned it."
5,andy warhol rock star,"i only downloaded the eleven second, ""silence"" by andy warhol, but it was worth every penny! he is a true musical genius! i had the original vinyl, and this track was a little hard to hear. the background noise seemed to drown it out (i understand that andy used to listen to the radio a lot when he was performing). this new remastered version is much better, the silence just seems to pop right out of the speakers! highly recommended!"
3,Somwhat confused,Nietzche is indeed a rather interesting philosopher however I feel after reading this book that I still do not know much about his philosophy. I can contrast this to the outstanding VSI book on Kant from which I think I learned a great deal. The author has the tendency to write very obscurely which is not a good thing for these kind of books which are written about authors or subject matter that often considered obscure to begin with. I think one would do a lot better just to pick up one of Nietzche's books and have a go at it.
3,"Too much style, not enough substance","When I bought this book I expected a brief introduction into the Philosophy of Neitzsche. Instead, I got a brief intro into Neitzsche the man. Sure he is an interesting character, but Tanner spends more time framing Nietzsche psychologically and gushing over his writing style than talking about his contributions to philosophy. He spends more time talking about Neitzsche's works then what they are actually about.This would be a great book if you were already familiar with Nietzsche's works and wanted some insight to his motivations. For a beginner, I suggest you look elsewhere. Finally, the author often presents philosophical terminology without explanation and uses vocabulary beyond the scope of the casual reader. While some of it makes sense in context, I often had to use a dictionary despite six years of college education."
3,Not for beginners,This book was my first venture into Nietzsche. I was really looking forward to reading this book but it turned out to be rather dull. It seems the authors attempted to string together book reviews of Nietzsche's work instead of evaluating what the man had to say.
2,Extremely learned omphaloskepsis,"After a few pages it felt to me as if this work was created to make a reader not give a frig what Coleridge thought. You all probably know the word 'omphaloskepsis,' but just in case you don't, it means 'navel-gazing,' and it's exactly what Hazlitt, a contemporary of Coleridge's, accused Coleridge of doing and succumbing to (though I doubt H. ever used the word). Well, this book is like a deepest dive possible into Coleridge's omphaloskepsis, into his omphalos, where the most miniscule pieces of lint become the objects most examined. I'm no dummy, not by a long shot, but after slogging through just a few pages of ""What Coleridge Thought"" I thought, 'This simply is not worth it.' Whoever wants to know what Coleridge thought should read what Coleridge wrote, I think."
2,Broke immidiately,"This product was very disappointing. First, it has a little switch, so you can't charge and sync at the same time. Second, the day after I got it, the retracting mechanism broke. Very disappointing."
2,"Carrom 750.33 Burr Oak - a dissapointing experience, not worth the price","We wanted to upgrade from a cheap fibre board store bought foosball table. The Carrom 750.33 Burr Oak table sounded good on the Amazon website, but turned out to be a dissapointing experience. I was expecting a more sturdy, well designed contruction, but found a flimsy fibre board contraption instead. It took the whole family of four people 3 hours to assemble it. The material used is no different from the low priced options available at sports authority. And there is no option to level the legs, despite what the description says. If you plan to buy a foosball table, pay another $100 to $200 for something better, or save your money and buy something on deal at Sports Authority."
5,Great deal for a top quality product,"I have to use a lot these hammer drill bits. This is the best price (about half of the home depot tag price) and the quality is very good.(fast drilling, last more, flexible.)"
3,Reports of actual ghost enconters in the 1800's,"This book written in 1921, documents to some degree actual cases of what might be called ""ghost stories"". Most are from the 1800's in England and Scotland. They are short accounts from historical records and interviews with persons or acquaintances having direct knowledge of the ghostly encounters. In no sense is this a scary story book for entertainment. It could be of great interest to persons studying psychic phenomena such as out of body reports. Also, it seems in certain high stress situations visual and audible communication can occur over great distances by thought processes. A short section gives reported cases of famous persons in the past such as Lincoln who had warning dreams and visions.Don't take such stories to lightly since our tax dollars have been used to fund what was once a secret group of our military who used what is sometimes called ""remote viewing"". It was real and it worked; probably still being used."
1,Real Ghost stories,I never received this book so I cannot review it . Might have been interesting to read but I will never know.
1,Not all that good,This book SUCKS!!! I hate it!! I suggest you do not download it!! It was a total wast of time!! Please Do Not Waste Your Time On This
1,lol,What ghost stories not enough material to keep you intersted just the same old rehashed stories i would not read again
4,Reviews,"This is an okay book. I didn't get HOOKED though. It takes a lot, but overall I am pleased with this book."
3,Interesting book,"This book was interesting but s bit slow paced for my liking. I was looking for a more timely story, but it was entertaining."
3,Nice book,Nice book. Great for kids. I bought a bunch of the classics for my two daughters. Great price and would probably buy again
3,SO SO,"Overall the book was decent, but I felt like it let me down. I was expecting a bit more out of this book. I really don't want to say too much and ruin it for other readers but with a name like Real Ghost Stories and expected actual real ghost stories."
2,Nothing special,"This is just a composite of happenings that have occurred over many years. Unexplained stuff that quickly becomes redundant. I finished the book, but never really found it of much interest."
3,Okaaay?,if you lke factual things this book is perfect for you. if not... this book was a little strange and im glad it was a freebee if i had spent 14$ on this book i would have been very unhappy. i could barely get through this book but who knows give it a try you might like it. its all a matter of opinion. this book is all a matter of taste that unfortunately doesnt match mine!
2,not ghost stories,"Very interesting but more on a psychosis, psychology level. People with different issues. I didn't read the whole book as it was not what I was looking for. Good thing it was free."
1,hate it,This book is the most stupidest book I've ever read. I like nightmares! But I didn't get a nightmare!This book should be the dumb ass book. (@$$)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a $%¡¿?!@# book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Oh Please,The author was either drunk or stoned when he wrote this. His ramblings made no sense what so ever.I will look elsewhere for a book on ghost stories.
5,Hammer from Above: Marine Air Combat Over Iraq,I purchased this book because a former student at our high school has an entire chapter written about him. Well done. It's about time someone's written about our helicopter pilots and the risks they take and the fighting they do for our country.
4,"Ah, memories!","There are high and low spots on this disk. It's a snapshot of the time of garage bands, experimenting with new sounds and having enough joints booking live music that you had some place to play and be bad while you gained experience and learned how to be good. Nowadays,you have to have a fairly polished act to even get in the door. I especially appreciate this disk because I accidently discovered it while cruising the internet, and found to my surprise that it contains three of the four songs that my band (The Cobblestones) recorded. (I wrote ""I'll Hide My Head in the Sand"" in 1965.) I didn't know that anyone noticed. Thanks for the memories. Jim Jacobs"
5,One of the best little-known SF books out there.,"I'm tickled that Amazon even has this book. It's extremely hard to find and seems to have only gone through one printing, and the binding on that printing is very poor. I've never seen a copy whose binding was not falling apart. Other than that annoyance this book is incredibly good. As someone else said it doesn't get bogged down in technobabble and nonsense like that. It's a short book but packs a lot between the pages. It's the tale of a child of the stars who lands on a planet and is raised by a very religious and loving couple. Del is our hero, ""Deliverance from the Void"" is his name. He was launched from an escape pod as an infant and finds this planet. As an older teen, he's taken by slavers and taught to fight or die in the arena. I won't go any further, I don't want to ruin anything. Get this book; you won't be disappointed."
3,Not impressed...,"I've had this for almost 2 years. I don't bake everyday so my sheet is not heavily used. In the beginning this was a great cookie sheet. It did everything I expected it to. I don't know how long I had it before it started warping. It is a rather large cookie sheet. I could've used one a little smaller but I thought it would be more sturdy. But everytime I bake something on it I can hear it warp in the oven after about 5 minutes after being placed in there. Also I saw another reviewer's comment about her cookies burning all the time when using this product. I get the same thing. I thought I was doing something wrong. And last but not least, the pan is not entirely non-stick either. I actually have brown burnt on grease stains on the pan that won't come off unless I scrub it hard. But if I do that the non-stick coating will come off too. Now when I use it I put a sheet of aluminum foil on the pan so it won't get any additional burning on it."
5,john rosell,"I was diagnosed with Stage four Lung Cancer last month and am undergoing conventional chemotherapy and radiation. I am an herbalist and acupuncturist so I immediately began my search for a reference and a colleague to assist me when the western approaches had done what they could do. I found Herbal Medicine, Healing and Cancer to be a first class resource. Comments that it was not suitable for the lay person, of course did not affect me, although my wife and three lay friends found it very readable. I am half way through conventional treatment and will be contacting either Mr. Yance or one of his colleagues for assistance in planning the second phase of my return to health."
5,The ultimate herb book,"I've bought many books about herbs over the last 30 years, and this one is the most comprehensive and written with the deepest knowledge."
5,"Herbal Medicine, Healing & Cancer: A Comprehensive Program for Prevention and Treatment",I heard about this book from posts by people dealing with the horrors of cancer and the search for alternatives. I’ve been into herbalism for a while and thought this book would be a great addition to my reference shelf. I found the book an interesting and informative read and think it has a great deal of good information for those in search of alternatives.
1,Very Little Book For a Complex Operation System,"First let me say that this book gives the reader a false sense of security. This book may give you a tip or two, but it is really useless in the real world. I looked through this book at thought how useless it would be at work. If you really want to learn Windows 2000 take a couple classes on it, if you are pressed for time and want a book on Windows 2000 pick up both ""Mastering Windows 2000 Professional/Server"" at least with those two books if you run into a problem you will have an idea on how to fix or at least know where to find your answers. This book is just too small for what will save your ""bacon"" out there..."
2,BAD HAIR!,"Well, most kids these days like Spongebob...even my aunt...but it is kind of a dumb idea...I do have her, and she's NOT my favorite...she has a keychain and an outfit that looks like PJs. And...HER HAIR! She has horror hair. Pigtails make it IMPOSSIBLE to tame, and her hair is uneven. Just don't get her...get a My Scene or Beach Fun Barbie...THEY'RE worth it."
4,Toy Fun,This toy is lots of fun. The only problem i had was when i took the sunglasses of they messed her hair up nothing i can't fix when i want to.
4,cute Barbie,My daughters love Barbie and this one is cute dressed up in her Spongebob attire. Comes with a little Spongebob that you could put on a key chain or on a coat zipper.
4,When Icons Collide!,"Yes, Barbie is an icon for a number of little girls and grown women. Spongebob has established himself as an up-and-comer and he'll probably stick around for quite some time. How great is it that Mattel slaps both together in a toy that is fun for little girls, especially my little one. She loves Barbie and Spongebob, so it was only natural that I purchase this for her when it came out.She plays with this toy often, though she plays with Barbie more than the Spongebob clip(can't do much with'im anyway). This is a fun toy that I'm sure many kiddies will love."
1,can't to use with my computer,"I ordered this product for my computer, but it is not, you do not have the same standard HP products, including the products that I adapted to it new again.Thank you for support me"
2,Dull,"I couldn't get into this book at all.. It just seemed a little far fetched that the ""Lady in Question"" was around the butler and Sir St. Stephans alot and still didn't see...that must have been a really good disguise or maybe our ""Lady in Question"" wasn't very perseptive. And really would a lady have such a close relationship with the butler? Just seemed a bit convienent.. I didn't like St. Stephans. He didn't match his profession at all..you'd think he'd be more careful and guarded but he just jumps right in to wanting to get married and forgets about his duties. The whole plot with the notebook...I forgot all about it...what was the point?"
5,Not your usual regency fare!,"The story line has been thoroughly reviewed by others. It is a very different plot and although the premise surrounds the bungling efforts of the ""Crown's agents"", 90% of the story revolves around the characters relationships and antics. It is a delightful romp. I thoroughly enjoy ""twin"" switches and that adds a great deal of fun to this tale. The hero is lovable as the old man (of 60) butler and is loved as the sexy viscount. A lot of love ""play"" and dialogue complete this circuitous story. It's just a fun read. I can't help wondering if there will be a sequel for Cassie, the ""troublesome twin""......."
4,Delightful read,"In the throes of a 'grand adventure', Delia marries, and a week later (after only one night of prenuptial indescretion) her husband is presumed dead. Six months later the story picks up with Delia's return to London after a self imposed exile. Like the one reviewer, I kept expecting Delia's dead husband to reappear. Unlike that reviewer, however, I didn't feel the book dragged at all. The emotional entanglements were novel, and handled quite intelligently. Delia, while at times rather childish, was nonetheless rather endearing. St. Stephens also generally rang true. I enjoyed the twists and turns, not the least of which were accomplished by learning what had happened in her first marriage via bits and pieces in flashback. The ending left some interesting threads hanging."
2,This book DRAGGED,"I forced myself to read this entire book because the author hinted in the prologue that the first husband might still be alive. This, I thought, could be interesting. I read and read, then skimmed and skimmed, waiting for the 'dead' husband to materialize, yet it seems he was truly dead. I still can't quite believe an author would hint that a key character could be alive, and then not develop the storyline.The characters were facet-less and the dialog wooden. This was my first Victoria Alexander novel, and my last."
1,Bratz really are brats,"These ""brats"" dolls are extememly a waste of money. My daughter now thinks she is living in tokyo because of these ethnic dolls that don't even look like they came from another country. For $50, it was a total waste! What is so interesting about tokyo in the first place, there is violence, robberies, and plenty of opther things I'm not going to mention. Down with Bratz!!!!!!!"
2,opinion,I was disappointed with the book that I received. The seller should have listed the author. I guess I assumed it would be a different author as there are so many of this book for sale at a fraction of the price - even on amazon and abebooks. I have seen this book listed for as low as $8. I definitely will be more careful in the future. The seller should always list the author.
4,Essentials of Neonatal Medicine,"I think that this short, well illustrated book is an excellent introduction to Neonatology,and will also serve well as a review for those undertaking further training in the subject. I strongly reccomend the text for medical students, midwives, and for junior paediatric trainees, doing their first rotation in SCBU/ NICU. I think it covers the common conditions very well, and gives a good balance between detail on the important, common problems, and also giving some brief information on the rarer neonatal problems that one also has to have some knowledge of. I found the text well supported by graphs, diagrams, and pictures. I think the only features that it lacked were some brief, illustrative case histories, and a self assessment section at the back of each chapter. I have read (and enjoyed) the book a few times."
5,A time of lively well harmonized music,"A time of lively well harmonized music and a time of ballroom dancing, when almost everyone danced.Perhaps a time for this great musical sounds to return for all to enjoy; at least you can order this 3 CD set and enjoy yourself."
3,Funny but nothing amazing,"Pretty cheap and not very well insulated. I would recommend wearing this over another set of clothes. Or even better, snag yourself some actual red pants to go with it."
2,Spartan Cheerleader - Male version,"It was funny, but way too thin. My husband wore pants underneath because of the material and the way it was cut."
3,"Autistic Kid Likes It, not as much as other Arthur CD-ROM's","My 7-year old daughter likes to play with this game, but she gets frustrated by some pages, and she doesn't like it as much as some other Arthur games (e.g. Arthur's Computer Adventure, Arthur's Birthday Party, Arthur's Reading Race), or the Pajama Sam games."
3,Hurricane Katrina - A brief perspective,"A nice clean documentary.I expected a little more either from a historical perspective of the city of New Oreleans or why the levees failed during Hurrican Katrina. This documentary gives a distant aerial perspective of what happened in one this country's most devastating events.Spike Lee's documentary 'When The Levees Broke' is a far more poignant and revealing insight into what happened, how it happened, and why."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Nova really let me down on this one. This DVD tells us a lot of what we already knew from watching the news during that time. Other documentaries surrounding this event, such as the National Geographic one, introduced new information and explanations. If you've already seen the National Geographic one, don't bother with this one. It's a shame, too. I usually like Nova..."
1,Salty Otherwise Bland,"This salmon would be most appealing to those who like a strong salty taste. Normally, such as taste would also come with a wood fire taste/smell. Not here: this fish is a combination of heavy salt and a very light smoke. It comes packaged in a brine and it has a briney flavor to it. If you like a heavy smoke taste or conversely a fresh fish taste avoid this product.I give it a subjective 1 star. Some people might like it but I found that the salt taste obscured all else and left a distinctive salty aftertaste."
1,Not What I expected,"Well, we just opened our box for a New Years breakfast. Not what I expected. First, there was no wooden box. Secondly, it was not the typical smoked salmon we are used to. As stated previously, this is packed in brine liquid. The fish did not appear to be smoked in either flavor or appearance. Although it is salmon, it tastes and smells more like a can of tuna. I give one star only because ZERO is not an option. I will not purchase this again."
5,Good Basic Southern Cookbook,I was not sure about this book at first but find myself going back to it again and again as a reference for basic Southern recipes or recipes I might not find elsewhere. Typically I will see a recipe that sounds good online and search for other similar recipes and reviews to combine and come up with one that works really well. Having this book allows me to check against time tested recipes and techniques I can trust and make corrections. Sometimes I start with a recipe in this book and modify it to suit my taste. It is an enjoyable read and a good reference.
1,don't buy,"We returned this product, was a lemon!! Cooling and heater didn't work, water had a bad taste."
2,"Holds standard 2 gallon, 3 gallon or 5 gallon bottle","The listing is in error it should read cooler holds standard 2 gallon, 3 gallon or 5 gallon bottle. (not 23 gallon) also the refridgeration does not last as long as a more expensive water cooler. But is is great to have a sealable pure water supply after it breaks down. I have a regular residential refridgerator that I just refill my portable bottles for cold water."
1,Ditto -- Don't Buy,What a piece of trash! (1) The water tasts bad. (2) It takes forever to heat or cool. (3) It holds only two cups of water. (4) The heatimg element on mine broke after the first day. (5) It has a noisy fan. They souldn't even give these things away.
2,OK but not highly recommended,"This program has many defects. The questions are not high level and the program itself will mess up as you play. I think the kids will like to play the game, but i do not think the questions are that great to help education."
1,Vendor disappointment,With great reviews I thought this vendor would be totally reliable. I was so excited to receive this item. Low and behold not only did it not ship but the vendor never replied to my emails and requests - 5 total. So disappointing and to think this would have been such a terrific gift for the holidays for the family. AndrewNewtonSales - never again.
3,Not worth the price!,"My son was swept away by the description of this game he found in a mail-order catalog. Playing it is less enchanting. The game goes on and on, and those who are not winning are not having a particularly good time. Although Dread Pirate is extremely beautifully made, it is not a favorite. We've had an amazing amount of fun with better games, such as Zendo and Chrononauts, playing game after game. There are certainly much worse games out there than Dread Pirate, but there are also a few that are tremendously better. Buy this game if you are more interested in the quality and feel of the game pieces than in how much fun the rules are."
1,The product was damaged.,"I don't know if it was the manufaturer, the seller or what, but this DVD Collection came to me as supposed to be brand new, yet had an abundance of sctratches and it was literally sandy or grainy...There was something on ALL of the disks and were not able to play AT ALL!The movies themselves I have seen on PBS station...I LOVE THE MOVIES!!!!!!!!!!!!Be carefull where you buy them!"
1,Bad Disk production THEY ALL SKIP,"These are great stories, however the ""Masterworks Collection"" is a rip-off. All of the disks start skipping around the second episode. Too bad really. I had to pay more to buy Bleak House and Little Dorrit seperately."
1,Unbearable,I thought I had purchased a defective set but after reading some of the reviews here I am convinced this is a poorly designed product. I cannot even describe the frustration we felt when we sat down to watch Little Dorrit and Bleak House. Every single DVD skipped and froze. It was impossible to watch. I wish I had not spent over $100 for this. My advice is not to purchase this product.
2,defective disks,I think the packaging damaged the disks. Each program stopped at various points. I tried 3 different players with the same result. Collection was returned.
3,"Brilliant, but...","This DVD is an astounding piece complimented by the enthralling narration by Murray Abraham (Salieri in Amadeus). Unfortunately, the program fails by ignoring other scientific traditions on which Western scientific tradition was largely based. I am tired of the Aristotle-Descartes genealogy that does not account for the influence of Egyptian and Muslim science. When Newton states that he had seen farther because he was standing on the shoulder of giants he meant not only Aristotle, Galileo, etc. but also those Muslim in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad who advanced universal science through leaps and bounds."
5,Great Purchase,This sign was exactly what I expected...lovely craftsmanship and a sturdy method of hanging. It makes a wonderful addition to our home.
2,What a mishmash. Who is Kellerman trying to be....,"What a disappointment this book is. Rina and Decker were believable (at least in the first few books) and the stories were very interesting. All the characters were people I became interested in and wanted to know more about. I did not like any of these characters and could not believe anything about them. I just did not care... and finally just put the book down. What a waste of money. Get back to some real writing, Faye, I know you have it in you"
1,"No sequel, PLEASE!","Thank goodness I didn't spend any money on this book that I checked out of the library! Bad enough to have wasted my time on such a disappointment.I love the Rina/Peter series and I've always thought her character development is Kellerman's strong suit. What's with this half-sketched mish mash of characters in this book? Did she even write the book herself? And although many of the books in this genre do become predictable, she tipped her entire hand in about the fourth chapter--I feel seriously cheated.Her attempt at mysticism seems more like an easy-out to an out of control plot than an answer to the murders. She also leaves many plot lines hanging, such as Alison's mother.Please don't continue with these horrible, underdeveloped, self-absorbed characters!"
4,Different and Enjoyable,"I regret several of my fellow readers did not enjoy this book. However, I found Kellerman's characters well developed and the plot enthralling. I just could not put this book down. Kellerman does an excellent job of allowing you inside the thoughts of all the characters, not just the main ones. I also enjoyed the Las Vegas setting and the excellent description of the topography-I ""felt"" the heat and the aridness of the city that never sleeps. Rom Poe is a likeable hero, but not without flaws. And Allison is an interesting villan. The new murders and the old unsolved murders of the Bogeyman kept me questioning who the killer or killers were. Just when I thought I had it completely figured out, Kellerman would throw me a curve. Thank you - I enjoy curve balls in a novel - especially in a murder mystery. The Indian mystic was also a nice touch."
2,A disappoint from a great writer,"What started off as a totally enthralling murder, set of characters and driving plot turned into the unbelievable. I didn't accept the cause of Alison's condition (there should have been hundreds of the ""them"" wandering around the dessert)and would have preferred if the ""mystical"" and Indian myths and beliefs aspects had been used. Very disappointing."
4,Great audio book!,I listened to Serpent's Tooth audiobook by Faye Kellerman and it was pretty good. But Moon Music is excellent. With a new character Romulus Poe. It kept my interest all the way through. I highly recommend it.
3,Interesting but flawed,"I have not read any other books by Faye Kellerman so I do not share the same disappointment of other readers. Overall I found the characters to be interesting and bizarre. It is refreshing to find ""heroes"" with flaws that are substantial. My main criticism of the book was a completely unbelievable (for me) ending. What is most frustrating was that it didn't have to be that way! There was at least one othe scenario for an ending that would have worked well."
1,This one deserves a minus rating.,"I have read all of Kellerman's Peter Decker books and have enjoyed most of them enormously. When I saw this one at the library I immediately checked it out. After plowing through half of it, trying to keep the characters straight and finding them so unpleasant I decided to come and read the reviews and wish I had done so earlier. Thank you to those reviewers who recommend utilizing my reading time on something that would be more enjoyable. I shall not be finishing this book. It will be back in the book drop this P.M. And yes, I agree that Amazon should have a zero stars rating, this one deserves it."
1,DREADFUL BOOK!,"Waste of time and money. Amazon should develop a negative scale, as well, something like little skunk symbols. This novel suffered from poor character development, laughable use of the supernatural, weak writing, weaker editing, AND bad proof-reading. I only finished it because I was trapped on a trans-Atlantic flight, and I chucked it in the trash when I got off the plane."
1,What a Disapointment,I have loved almost everything from Faye Kellerman. The ones I didn't love I did like. This book was awful. I got lost - cared for none of the characters - and could barely make it through. I usually enjoy this type of story from Koontz or King but I hope Kellerman returns to the style I enjoyed. I Look forward to the next book restoring my faith in Kellerman.
1,What was she thinking of?,"I have read every Faye Kellerman mystery novel. The lead characters, a Los Angeles detective and his Orthodox Jewish wife, have been fun to ""watch"". The writing occasionally causes me to grit my teeth but overall the books are a fun and quick read. So, when I picked up ""Moon Music"" I was hoping for more of the same, freshened up by a new setting and new characters. The first chapter seemed promising; Las Vegas is nicely showcased and I liked the interaction between the detectives. But I soon became disenchanted. The killer is revealed to the reader much too soon; thereafter, the plot becomes less a detective novel and more a really bad horror story. Complete with mysteriously mutilated bodies, absurd supernatural complications and circus-escapee characters--not my cup of tea at all and an unfortunate surprise from Ms. Kellerman. Skip ""Moon Music"" and read her first novel ""The Ritual Bath"" instead."
1,A grest disappointment from a favorite author.,"This book makes me think that one of her husband Jonathan's mutants from his disappointing ""The Web"" sneaked into their house and read a Tami Hoag or Stephen King novel and surreptitiously wrote this book in the dark of night. Not to mention that, to my surprise, Clinton and Lewinski spin offs appeared by page 20 not having a sexual relationship! The dialogue is amateurish and character development nonexistent. Only one with her track record would ever have had a chance to get this published. Take a pass."
1,The Characters are stereotyped and the plot is ridculous.,"I loved all past Fay Kellermans books, including the one set in Elizabethan London. I looked forward to her new book. What a disapointment. The characters are flat, there is nothing to get hold of. Her style of writing is ""bitty"". And worst of all the plot is worse than bad and offensive."
2,Strange,"I had heard very good things about this author, and decided to give her book a try. I found the beginning quite good however, as we approached the end it became ridiculous. I hope this is not indicative of her other works."
1,Major disappointment from Faye Kellerman,"This was a big disappointment. I felt like I'd picked up a book from someone trying to imitate Dean Koontz. Her books have always been mysteries with characters you cared about. This was science fiction with characters that I really couldn't like. The nuclear contamination causing animal morphing was a little too much to take. I kept thinking she'd bring the book back around to a reasonable conclusion. I kept thinking I'd learn to like the characters. Instead, I never could like the people or believe the plot. I've always passed her books on to other Faye Kellerman fans, I don't think this one will be taking that same path."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or $$ - Lousy!,"I think to really enjoy a book you have to sympathize with, empathize with, or at least like the main characters. In Moon Music, the ""hero"" is a cop, engaged to a doctor whom he cheats on regularly with a prostitute. The doctor knows it but doesn't seem to mind. He also is in love with his partners wife, who was his first love 20 years ago!! Get over it buddy will ya!! I found nothing likable, sympathic or empathic in this guy. Not to mention the book had a dumb ending, screaming SEQUEL. I won't be wasting my time or money on it. I had high hopes for this book, as I really like werewolf tales. I also have read one other of Ms. Kellerman's Peter Decker series and liked it. Don't waste your time."
1,This was my first and last Faye Kellerman read.,"If I hadn't found since that she has a history of writing excellent books, I would have believed this was written in a high school creative writing class. I finished it since I could hardly believe that a book that had started out promising could degenerate so badly. The only person who should be more ashamed of this mess than the author is the editor."
4,An offbeat thriller by an author I normally don't like...,"I usually find Faye Kellerman's books dry as the desert she describes so aptly in Moon Music, but this book riveted me from the beginning. I checked out the audio book from the library because it was the only thing that looked remotely exciting; I ended up having to go buy the book because I couldn't wait to see how the story unfolded. I loved the characters and complexity of each, and their relationships with each other. I enjoy supernatural stories so I had no problems with that element. However, I did not know it was a werewolf book going into it and I think if it were clearly marked as such, would attract a different readership than Kellerman's usual books. All in all I'm glad I stumbled across it."
2,"Keep the new characters, but scrap the mysticism","Having read all the previous reviews of Moon Music, I must admit to agreeing with most of them. As a fan of the Decker/Lazarus mysteries, I looked forward to Faye going in another direction and introducing a new setting with new characters. I would definitely like to see the new cast come back in a story that is in the here and now, not in the world of mysticism.Good news to all Faye's dedicated fans - her newest book Jupiter's Bones is due out in Aug 1999.For anyone who said they would not read anything else by Faye, think again. Her Decker/Lazarus series is one of my favorites."
2,Disappointing with a weird supernatural twist!,"If you are a fan of Faye Kellerman's, this is not her finest moment. Her novels, usually believable and viable, are typically a great pleasure to read. This one is just too bizarre-mixed with alleged mental illness topped with supernatural overtones-disappointing!"
1,What a stinker this is!,"Having enjoyed husband Johnathon's efforts I chose this as a sample of Faye's work ... a terrible mistake. As well as unlikable, most of the characters are downright pitiful; thay all seem emotionally ill in unlikely ways.The style is so far from transparent that continuing to read past the first 100 pages or so was a terrible ordeal. I have, quite literally, seen far better work from failing author wannabees. Surely, if there are indeed ""over three million copies"" of her work in print, Mrs. Kellerman can do better than this!I can only conclude that this is cynical exploitation of the ""I had a bestseller"" principle. The author, editor, and publisher should be profoundly ashamed of theirselves, as should you if you buy this book in face of the overwhelmingly negative reviews."
1,Very disappointed,"I am a big fan of Faye Kellermans, but this book was a major disappointment. It wasn't just that this is a departure from her series. There is not one character in this book to like, they are all sleazy and unbelievable. But the main problem for me was her attempt into the bizarre- a character that ""morph's"" belongs in Jonathon Kellermans books, not hers. The ending was so unbelievable, it left me feeling cheated."
2,New characters killed by the super natural!,"Faye, Faye, Faye!! You could have established a new set of great characters to go with your other series. By making the story so unbelievable it really hurts. Just like Patricia Cornwell's departure Faye misses the mark."
1,"Disliked it, too....","Never again will I pick up a Faye Kellerman book and buy it without checking here first! Bought the paperback because I had always liked her books. This one was so stupid, that I couldn't believe that it was written by the same author! Ridiculous and unbelievable right through."
3,Not your average Faye Kellerman novel........,"Her previous novels have believable, 3 dimensional characters, exciting plots AND most of all, logical conclusions. Despite the 400 plus pages, the book would have been much better off without the supernatural.Overall, Faye misses the mark with Moon Music."
2,Points for Chutzpah!,"A daring departure from the Rina Lazarus and Peter Decker stories, ""Moon Music"" is a complex sketch of lowlife in Vegas. Although I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone (sorry, Faye), I would welcome another foray into the lives of Rom, Steve, Patricia and Rukmani. She paints an interesting dynamic between the characters, but fails miserably at giving us a good story. The plot is convoluted, difficult to believe and ultimately disappointing. The relationship between Rom and Alison is more annoying than intriguing, and the constant addition of characters and plot threads is frustrating.All in all, a nice try, but too much all at once! Keep it simple Faye; you're good at that."
2,Please bring back Rina and Peter,"This book could have been good, but .... There were virtually no characters in this book that I liked. Fat Patty was the only one I could maybe like (but I think mostly I felt sorry for her because she was picked on). Does everyone in Las Vegas sleep indiscriminately with prostitutes, or just the characters in this book?The plot was pretty good until about three-fourths of the way through---then the unbelievable radioactive theory came out. Faye suddenly could not decide whether she was Stephen King or Dean Koontz. Unfortunately, she was neither and the book ended in a totally rediculous and boring way."
3,A mostly successful experiment.,"""Moon Music"" offers a welcome change of pace for Faye Kellerman, with an interesting (if sparsely drawn) cast of characters. Although the killer's identity becomes fairly clear not long into the story (notwithstanding some red herrings along the way), it's an entertaining read--right up to the ending, when it morphs into an episode of the X-Files.Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's a jarring transition out of the otherwise straightforward murder mystery format. And it leaves you wondering just how much influence TV might have had on the plot development--the autopsying coroner recalls the Scully character and the misfit detective rings a little of Mulder. No doubt that resemblence is a coincidence, but one that wouldn't have come to mind at all if the book hadn't so sharply turned to the supernatural, with no answers given to the puzzles raised by the ending."
2,A major disappointment,"It's hard for me to say what most bothered me about this book. Unsympathetic characters, a plot that zig-zags from procedural detective story to hokey werewolf tale, or possibly the weak mystery behind the whole thing. I never figure out a whodunit, but this one I had worked out within 50 pages. Perhaps worst of all is Faye Kellerman's growing tendency to add graphic sexual content, profanity, and extreme violence to her novels. Hopefully she has gotten this book out of her system and will get back to her characters that we care about and root for."
1,This is a hugely disappointing effort by Faye Kellerman,"Being a longtime fan of Faye Kellerman's work and having read her entire repetoire of novels, I found this book to be a sad disappointment in voice and style. The style is disjointed and the speakers voices are confusing to identify. Peter and Rina needed a rest and the development of a new clan of characters by Faye Kellerman was seemingly a novel worth worth waitng to read. But it is, instead, a trite effort at copying Connelly's, Trunk Music and it does not work."
3,"Far fetched, yes, but that's why it's called FICTION...","I waited for paperback after reading all the negative comments here. At any rate, it isn't SO horrible. The characters *are* different, but let's face it, Rina was getting a little tiresome in her physical perfection and moral uprightness. I was glad for a break. I liked Patricia and would like to get to know her better and hey, different ""characters"" make the world go 'round. As for the supernatural aspects, c'mon it's no worse than Patterson's flying children or Koontz's freaky monkeys. I do agree that it was too easy to figure out....a little more mystery next time would be nice."
4,I loved it.,"No, it is not what I expected, and that is a good thing. If you are looking for to be throughly entertained by another's imagination this is the book for you. And what an imagination she has. Totally unpredictible ride from cover to cover. I liked the characters with all their little ""twitches"", I liked the brothers' dealings with the mother. These characters have flaws a mile wide and still remain human and likable. The sci-fi twist was different, and I loved it. I probably would not have picked it up if I had known about the s/f aspect so I an grateful that I didn't. I felt the voice of Poe was right on target. Las Vegas will never be the same for me. Brava! Waiting for the sequel."
2,Not for True detectives...,"While this book show's Ms. Kellermans ability at characterization and dialogue, the plotting and plot devices are indescribably horrible. I am a fan of her other series and I thought the excerpt of this looked interesting....wrong!! It is unbelievably bad and the ending is a total disappointment. If you love reading mysteries and actually trying to solve them as you read, don't bother with this book. The ending is so outrageous (not to mention inconsistent) that it will leave you ANGRY! I can't believe that I wasted any time reading this book!PS I thought that I had dropped into the middle of a new series but apparently not..this is the first book (and I hope the last) of this series!"
3,Moon Music,"I've never read any Faye before. Being a huge Jonathan Kellerman fan, after running through all of his Delaware books I decided to try Moon Music. I picked it up in a second hand store and a woman walking past me said, ""That was a great book."" I agree with her. I want more Romulus Poe. Please let's have a sequel. I want more of this world of Faye's. I think I can fall as much in love with Poe and his tribe as I have with Jonathan Kellerman's Milo and Alex."
2,Thumbs down to Romulus Poe,I struggled with this book. I could never quite like the main character. He seemed such a weak person and always a day late figuring out the obvious. I don't think his physical size was the what made his image so whimpy. His attitude was his downfall.
3,It's something new,"I, too, have been a fan of Faye Kellerman's Decker/Lazarus novels & have loved everyone of them. I was a little disappointed to find she had taken a different track with this one. However, as an occult/horror fan as well, I found this book interesting. Yes, although you may have figured out early on ""who dunit"" the why of it is what kept my interest to the end. I think the reading public doesn't realize that writers who do series on the same characters or themes, must get tired writing about the same thing. I like to see them branch out with some new ideas from time to time. Faye Kellerman is still high on my reading list."
2,I think someone else wrote this book!,"I have read every one of Faye Kellerman's books and never been dissapointed. This one,however,I could barely finish. (I guess I knew even then that the ending was stupid).This is a huge switch from her usual realistic depiction of family life and police work.I didn't like the characters, I didn't care ""whodunit"" or why, and I missed Peter and Rina Lazarus. If you must read this, buy it used or borrow it-don't waste your money. Jupiter's Bones was much better."
3,"Weird, confusing, Miss the Deckers","Faye Kellerman is still an excellent writer and worth reading, but this book is super weird and contains too much detail. Very confusing number of plot twists. Got dizzy trying to keep up with everybody. Come back, Deckers."
1,Far-Fetched Poorly Developed Tale,"This is my first Faye Kellerman reading experience and probably my last. The plot borders on the ridiculous and the characters are poorly defined and superficial. I ""ho-humed"" my way through it. The only positive note is Ms. Kellerman's vivid imagination."
1,Moon Music hits sour note.....,"As an avid Faye Kellerman fan I was truly expecting to like this book a lot. Unfortunately I had to make myself finish the book, just to make sure that I didn't miss anything. I wanted to give a fair accounting of the book. I frankly didn't like any of the characters, it's almost as if Ms. Kellerman went out of her way to make each of them quirky and/or immoral. She lost me when Poe stops at the prostitutes for a quicky on his way to his girlfriends! The whole basis for the killers ""motive"" was way too far out there for my liking as well. I will still look forward to any new books from Ms. Kellerman as I think she is very talented,I just didn't happen to like this one.Ree-views"
2,More like a Jonathan Kellerman book than a book by her.,"This book is a completely different book from the books her audience is used to reading. This books lacks the wonderful sense of tradition in the Peter Drucker/Rita Lazarus books. I found this book an attempted copy of one of her husband, Jonathan Kellerman's genre. Disappointing and disturbing and definitely not up to the quality of her other books."
4,"Good page-turner, but a little far-fetched.","While I did enjoy this story, I was distracted by the author's overuse of the phrase ""a beat"" to describe a pause in a character's conversational dialog. It became trite, unnecessary, and annoying by chapter 4. Otherwise, this is a good murder mystery with an usual, if far-fetched, twist. To its credit, it did keep me up way passed my bedtime."
2,Please don't judge all of Faye Kellerman's books on this one,"This was not one of her best but hardly her worst. Yes, there were some medical mistakes (i.e. you DON'T put anything in anyone's mouth that is having a seizure)but it was an OK mystery. I won't swear off Faye Kellerman because of it. I will agree with another reader that if I had read ""A break"" one more time the book would have met an untimely death also! I wish the ending hadn't been quite so ""imaginative"", it seemed that she was tired of writing and went for the most absurd!"
3,good but offbeat,"I like this book. The only thing I didn't like was the way Kellerman threw in ""a beat"" all through out the book."
1,one of the worst mysteries I ever read,"This novel is so awful that I am convinced anybody can get published. Fortunately, I rented an audio version--abridged and only 4 cassettes long for a trip I made recently. It is not well plotted, it is not accurate with regard to setting (Las Vegas, NV), the characters are barely one dimensional. If you read mystieries stick with real writers like Barr, Grafton, Elmore, etc."
1,Wasn't prepared for sci fi. Disappointing!,"Oy Faye!!!! When did you become a science fiction writer? The book was spellbinding-AT FIRST then went rapidly downhill when Alison begins to morph. Began to read like my son's Animorph series. Stick with a good thing when you have it Faye. The whole book was too psychotic for me, very much like your characters. Two thumbs down on this one, and that's from a fan who's enjoyed every one of your other books. Better luck next time for both of us."
1,Am I allowed to say that this SUCKED!,"I am one of those readers that normally can't put a book down until I know ""who dun it."" I put this down too many times to count...and kept hoping that something/someone would come from behind to save this. I was on my very last Faye book - got really sick of her attempt at characterization by showing off her ""Jewish"" knowledge - most of the time it had very little to do with her characters, but added a little interesting information. But what the heck was this? Stick to what you know, even if it can be somewhat annoying...that's ever so much better than absolute disbelief! I will never, EVER, read another of her titles...too much to read and too little time to waste mine! I feel a little guilty - this is the first public bashing I have ever done of an author - but it was well deserved."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This was an interesting book, but very unlike her others. It was also annoying in that she obviously does not understand how video poker works, yet she goes back to it over and over. I probably would have enjoyed more had I been in the mood for this type of stuff."
1,"Weird, convoluted and needed better research","The basic premise of this book was interesting to me, and I'm a long time of Kellerman's Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus novels. I find her insights into Judaism fascinating...however, having read this book, I begin to wonder how much of her data about Judaism to trust. I say that because I am a member of the LDS church (better known to most as Mormon) and in Moon Music she makes some pretty basic mistakes about the faith (Mormon's don't wear crosses!) Over all, the book was disappointing, the plot was a little meandering, and while I liked some of her new characters, I missed Peter and Rina..."
1,"Faye, what happened?","After reading and enjoying every Peter and Rina mystery, Ieagerly bought Moon Music, thrilled that Ms. Kellerman was branching out. UGH -- what a mistake, what a disaster, what a travesty! ...The characters are not only unsympathetic, they're downright despicable; the depiction of women and sex in it are nothing short of misogynistic, and the premise of the whole story is simply ludicrous. UGH..."
1,What was Faye Kellerman thinking?,"This book was bad, bad, bad. I've read my share of mysteries with fantastical plots, but this book had not even one sympathetic character. I didn't care about anyone, I didn't care about the story, and I didn't care about the outcome. In fact, I didn't even read this book in its entirety (and I normally manage to plod through anything once I've started), but my mother (who had loaned me the book) assured me that finishing the book was a waste of time. I LOVE Kellerman's other books, but I won't be tricked into buying another book with these characters again. Kellerman fans - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Ouch!!,"This is my first Faye Kellerman novel. OUCH!! The book moves very slowly, but does manage to develop a murder mystery. Characters are poorly developed, and many have the same vices but at a different level of intensity. You grind yourself through the book hoping for a good ending, but NOOOO!!! The book takes a totally diffrent direction and suddenly loses the storyline and becomes fanatasy/science fiction. I doubt the book would have ever been published if the auther had not had previous successes. Don't waste your time...Made me wish I had't wasted my time with first 7/8 of the book!!!! (By the way, this is the most negative review I have ever written!!)"
1,"Sorry, but I'm feeling let down!","I have enjoyed all of Mrs. Kellerman's Decker/Lazarus novels. Of course, I couldn't wait to find a copy of Moon Music to soak up the lives of a new bunch of her detectives! Fat Patty (now, who would call a fellow detective Fat Patty??) was really the only appealing character! I hate to be critical, but I just didn't enjoy this book. I kept reading, though, hoping for some improvement in the story or some twisted reason for the murders. I really wanted to like some of the characters. What I really don't like is people turning into animals & that being the motive for murder."
3,Dissapointing,I have read all of Faye Kellermans books that I can get my hands on and have loved them all. . . until now. What is with the Mormon bashing? If she is going to trash a religion she should at least do some research and trash with some facts. Makes me wonder if all the Jewish information that I have enjoyed so much is factual. I don't think I'll be buying anymore of Ms. Kellermans books.
2,Horror for Beginners?,"I loved the research Kellerman put into making the Las Vegas area come to life in my mind. I liked the new characters, but they weren't quite as developed as the Decker characters. I kept thinking that maybe Kellerman was trying to break into the Anne Rice genre of seductive horror. It almost held my attention... but it seemed like some of the plot was a stretch. I think Kellerman needed a break from her usual characters and crimes. Maybe Moon Music was a ""let's do something else cause I'm burned out on Decker/Lazarus novels."" I give it a so-so... don't buy the hardback, but if you see it in a used bookstore, go ahead and grab it!"
1,What a disappointment,"As a big fan of Faye Kellerman I was really looking forward tothis book being published. I bought it the day it came out. I washugely disappointed in it. It wasn't interesting, it wasn't well plotted and I was saddened by her choice to denigrate the Mormon faith. I have really loved reading her Rina Lazarus books and learning about the Jewish faith. I have respected the character of Rina Lazarus and her devotion. So I was quite surprised that Faye Kellerman could show such a lack of respect to another faith. It was also factually incorrect, in one scene she describes a Mormon girl at her first communion wearing a cross necklace. Mormons do not celebrate first communion, and they never use the symbol of the cross. Did she not do her research? How difficult would it have been to find out? It makes me wonder about the rest of her facts. How sad."
1,No stars,"I was hooked on Faye Kellerman's books after reading the first Rina Lazarus/Peter Decker story. Ms. Kellerman can tell a wonderful story with characters whose fundamental goodness stands in such sharp contrast with the surrounding ugliness that police work entails. However, _Moon Music_ was a real disappointment. None of the characters seems authentic with the possible exception of an overweight woman officer. The rest are weak cartoon images. The red herring mystic transformations toward the end are almost laughable, and even the recurring theme of compulsive behavior was in desperate need of further research. I have no particular investment in the Decker/Lazarus stories; certainly Kellerman should be celebrated for moving on to other stories. I just hope the next story is one worth reading."
2,Sort of Silly,"This was not even close to being a horrible book. This is the worst book I have read by Faye Kellerman however. I was disappointed that I wasted my time reading it, especially by the time I got to the silly, supernatural ending. I like books dealing with the supernatural but this one just touched on it and not in a way that was believable or intriguing."
4,"Poe, not Decker","Fans of the Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series take note! Amazon lists it as one of these novels but it's not. Faye Kellerman has taken a bold departure from her regular characters here and I'm not surprised to see mixed reviews from readers. Here's a glimpse of a sordid, violent side of Las Vegas you don't see as a tourist, presented in a compelling story that veers off into the supernatural.That said - I loved the book. I found it a gripping page turner and the ambiguous ending only raised hopes that there will be more of this tale. If you like Stephen King you probably will like Moon Music."
2,Bad news for Kellerman fans,"I only wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money on this book. It started out promising but I really didn't care for most of the characters. Fat Patty was probably the best and it was a shame to degrade her with that nickname and have her find a big fat boyfried. I don't like to know from the very begining of a mystery who done it and this was so easy to figure out. Plus about 3/4 of the way in it turns into a sci-fi book; what's with that ending! Please Faye go back to your Rina character, forget about Poe in the future. I won't buy a sequel."
3,A Different Spin,"I have read several of Faye Kellerman's books, and eagerly await each new title. This one was a bit disappointing. While it did have the characteristic suspense of her other novels, the style was a bit annoying. I was particularly put off by the continuous interjection of ""a beat"" to indicate a pause in conversation. This was severely overdone. The characters lacked the warmth and likability of Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus. The fantasy ending seemed to come completely out of nowhere. There was no preparation early in the story for such an event, and it seemed contrived. The psychological analysis of characters seemed more consistent with her husband's style than her own, and I found myself wondering if he had a hand in the writing of this book. If this were my first Faye Kellerman book, I doubt I would read another."
2,Fantasy Overload,"After reading several of Faye Kellerman's books, ""Moon Music"" sounded especially interesting considering her new environment and heroine, Poe.The story started out very good, but about 3/4 of the way through I was appalled to realize that Kellerman had completely gone off the deep end. The story was no longer a mystery, but an unbelieveable fantasy that had me laughing by the time I had finsihed the book. I am very disappointed that the book started out well, but had loose ends and a farfetched plot by the last remaining chapters. I definitely do not recommend this book to any of Faye Kellerman's fans."
3,No Redeeming Value,"I wonder if Ms. Kellerman was hoping to make up for lack of a plot through the use of very foul language, poor taste and strange characters with no redeeming value? Come on, now, girlfriends who encourage their lovers to go get satisfaction from prostitutes and manage to keep smiling while doing his dirty laundry? I thought this was a detective novel, not science fiction! This was my first experience reading a Faye Kellerman novel. Unfortunately, it will probably be my last. Very disappointing. : ("
3,"This book has good beginning,but the ending is disappointing","Initially, I was disappointed that this was not a Peter Decker/Rita Lazarus book. After I finished the book, my disappointment was renewed. I immediately got caught up in the action of the story. It was truly a page turner, I couldn't put it down. This, inspite of the too frequent references to the sexual activity of the characters. The ending however, was very disappointing. What happened, did Kellerman run out of ideas? The ending is incomplete, it reminds me of a Hitchcock movie. Is the reader supposed to make up their own ending? There were still so many unresolved plot twists, plus the foray into mystic-demonism seemd unnecssay and unbelievable. I hope Kellerman will return to her usual characters and plots. Why mess with success?"
5,Moon Music,"I stopped reading the Decker/Lazarus mysteries because they became routine after a while. I could figure out who the killer was and just stopped reading this series.But just 2 days ago I came across Moon Music and found it to be totally addictive! It was so different and intriguing, it was hard to put it down. Most of the reviews I read claimed it was disappointing but I disagree. I loved the main character Romulus Poe and was also intigued with Dr. Rukmani Kali.Don't try to compare this book with Kellerman's other mysteries. Have an open mind and enjoy it for what it is: good entertainment."
1,very disappointed in the research,"I was thoroughly disappointed with Ms. Kellerman's latest novel. The Las Vegas she writes about no longer exists. It is a fully developed, vibrant city. Everything she writes about the city is old hat. Summer is now the biggest tourist season (without cheap come-ons). There are very few men with the kind of power she attributes to Lewiston, as most of the hotels are corporate owned. Her directions at the beginning of the book from Red Rock to Main Street are completely erroneous. Makes me wonder just how accurate her portrayals of Judaism are in the Decker series."
2,Disappointing novel from one of my favorite writers,"What happened to the tightly-plotted, morally-grounded novels we have come to cherish from Faye Kellerman? This new book dabbles in metaphysics or insanity or some such psychobabble. The characters are universally unlikeable (except perhaps the coroner). Even the depiction of the underbelly of Las Vegas fails to satisfy in comparison of other portrayals we've seen (like Leaving Las Vegas). I don't mind a new set of characters but I want to like them and I want a more plausible plot."
2,A major disappointment!,"Having read all of Faye Kellerman's previous books, I was happy to see a new title arrive. I can understand the author's desire to create a new set of characters and try a slightly different writing style. With all those short, choppy sentences I thought I would be reading a more hard nosed type of mystery. Other than Poe, I found the characters shallow, couldn't get all the detectives straight until half way thru the book. When the story melted into into it's ""fantasy"" ending, Kellerman lost me completely. I finished the book simply to see how it ended, not through enjoyment! Please bring back Peter and Rina! If Poe is to return give him a more reasonable plot."
2,Kellerman should stick to Decker and Lazarus,"Though her new characters were interesting, there was no softness and love in this book. The whole premise was far fetched and I think she has been living with her husband too long. His very dark way of looking at human behavior has rubbed off and I was surprised that other people enjoyed it. I'll await Peter and Rina's return."
3,I was disappointed in the book itself.,"Although I became quite interested in Poe, the main character, I was quite disappointed in the book. I figured out who committed the first murder quite early in the book. I also did not care for the amount of sexual descriptions and the ""imaginary"" angle she used in this book. I really felt that this was written as more of a ""commercial success"" than her Decker series. I personally enjoyed all of the Decker series (but saw where she was trying to become more commercially accepted in False Prophets). If Ms. Kellerman continues with Poe I hope she does it more in the Decker style without the extra ""sex and smoke screen"". She knows how to write a great murder mystery and I hope she will continue to do so."
2,Not as good as Rina and Peter!!,"I was very excited to see a new novel by Faye Kellerman, but was soon disappointed. The story is extremely difficult to follow. There are too many characters and none of them are well developed. The only thing Ms. Kellerman hit right on the nail was her description of Las Vegas. Stick to what you do best and please give us more stories with Rina and Peter!"
1,The worst she has ever written,"The characters were all unlikeable, immoral without any direction in their lives. If this is the new Faye Kellerman, I won't be reading her any longer"
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of both Faye and Jonathan Kellerman's work, but this book left me very flat. The characters are more interested in gambling and whoring than their jobs, so I found it very difficult to identify with them. I suspect the tale is a very accurate depiction of Las Vegas life (at least for some of the residents), but it all seemed like LA without the redeeming qualities. The plot did draw me in, but only to lead me to an utterly ridiculous conclusion. Genre shifting at the last chapter is definitely uncool."
3,Certainly different from the usual Kellerman style,"This was an intiguing story with fair plot and character definition. The story line is definitely different from the usual Kellerman novels that we are used to. There is only a hint of the ""Jewishness"" which I have become fond of in her other books. I felt at times the dialogue was sketchy and out of context, it was difficult to follow and jumped rapidly among characters. The story was also quite radical and out of line with usual detective stories."
1,What a waste of time!!!,"If it were merely poorly written as are many of her other books (and I have read them all ignoring her writing for her superior story telling ability), I could have tolertated this book. But, poorly written coupled with a ridiculous, shallow story and undeveloped characters is more than I can stomach. I have bought, read and mailed all her other books to my family in Texas to enjoy. This one will go to the recycle center."
1,Yuck!!!,"It's hard to believe this book was written by Faye Kellerman. The ending leaves the story wide open for a sequel, but I for one won't be reading it."
1,An incredibly disconnected story,"I'm a big fan of Faye Kellerman's Peter and Rina mystery novels. I would have rated this book 0 stars, but it wasn't an option. I can understand an author wanting to go off in a different direction...but this book is just terrible...the characters, the plot, the dialog! Every character was unlikable and shallow. At least when Carl Hiasson writes about ""unlikable"" characters, he does it with humor. The plot was disconnected, unbelievable, and boring. I just wanted to get through the book in order to see how it ended. And the ending!!! A woman changes into man-eating bird or wolf..or whatever. Faye, go back to Peter and Rina."
5,"If you take it serious, this is your book","If you are an audioguy you need only two books. a) Sound System Engineering from Don and Carolyn Davis and b) This one. Dont ask, just get it."
2,Misses the mark,"The whole point of these products is to fine tune the air output of each outlet in order to set the function needed perfectly. For example, an air powered ornament needs a different amount of air than a bubble wall, than an under gravel filter, etc.This product fails this big time. It's impossible to fine tune anything because the knobs don't turn smoothly, if at all. I have to use pliers on them to get anything different from full on or full off and the sticky action of the valves makes even crude settings impossible.I would have been better off using a rats nest of tee's."
1,Wlite 5-way air control valve,Bought two of these and one knob broke off on install. Did not want to bother with returning them and tried to use them anyway. After about 3-4 adjusting almost all of the knobs had broken off and ended up buying stainless screws and installing them for the knobs instead. Very disappointing indeed!!!
3,good for the price,"good valve for the price, but leaks a little bit. It only has one input so get 2 of them if you have a dual output pump."
1,Cheap,Does not provide the wattage.My amp burned them within the first song played.I would suggest the Boss bullets to everyone.
5,Eye opening overview of a complex subject,This book is visually designed to open the mind. A great choice as a introduction to the complex study of feng shui. I have yet to find another book which handles the conflicting schools of modern and classical feng shui with more diplomacy. I loan this book to friends and family who ask me about feng shui and refer to it often myself. The layout is unconventional yet easy to read. A beautiful book I would highly recommend.
1,Defective Disc...Where's Quality Control?,"Normally these guitar play along dvds have good material and instruction. My rating is on the quality control of the product and not the material. I received my dvd last week and when I opened the package I noticed on back of the dvd that they printed the snapshot pictures of the lessons upside down. I laughed it off until....I went to watch the dvd. This dvd gives you 4 different options to watch and learn. The first 4 songs I checked out, 2 of those options were upside down like in the pic! This does not aid in learning the song!!!!. I didn't bother to try and watch the other 4. I can't believe this dvd made it out of quality control. If I hear that they fixed the problem, I'll re-purchase in the future. Thanks to Amazon for the great customer support."
3,"Good Substance, some mistakes","The chapters are organized by person mainly instead of in chronological order, which I like. Each chapter is full of information the author fits a lot of information in small places. I'm finding some mis-spellings which I plan to notify the author of because with a well researched book like this, gramatical errors shouldn't be a distraction."
3,Nice travel pack,"The travel pack came with all that was advertised; convertable pole, 2 reels. The spinning reel was nice and smooth. Never tried the fly reel.Pole is very , very light weight. It lasted about 4 days. On the 5th day it snapped. Easily repaired. I was using 2oz spoon. Probably shouid have used 1oz and under. I bought two kits and will keep the second one just in case."
1,Great idea falls short,"I purchased this combo pack, it seemed like a great idea. Unfortunately, the first day i used it, the tip broke off the rod. The reels seem like they are okay quality for the money, and the package is nice, but what good is it without the rod. The rod markings say it is medium weight, 6 - 14 lbs, but the true capacity is far less. If you are only catching pan fish, then this might work out for you. If you are hoping for something larger than 1/2 a pound, you should look elsewhere."
1,Rod broke first time out.,"First time out the tip broke. Didn't just break, it splintered and broke. Third or 4th cast, reeling in a small rooster tail lure in a lake.Seriously, this rod is a piece of .... and I really wish I would have read the other reviews about the rod and/or rod tip breaking before buying it.I would have sent it back, but I bought this POS about 6 months prior to actually using it on vacation.When I bought it, I set it up to make sure everything was good then packed it back up in the nice carry case. Realistically, I should have tried it out right then, then gotten my money back. Oh well, live and learn!"
4,Not bad,This product is exactly what I expected when purchased. I backpack often and there are some alpine lakes that I like to fish. Lugging my expensive fly rod and case is added weight I don't need for a week in the back country so this fits perfectly. It's not a high-quality rod but it is a hard working one. Recommend to anyone who hikes in for days and wants to have a versatile fly/spin combo.
3,Rod broke,"Took this backpacking. Was really nice because it was compact. My son got one of these a few years back and for the most part no problems. On mine, the 2nd time I pulled it out to fish, the end of the rod broke off. All I did was lift it out of the container. I didn't force it or twist it. To make it work, I broke the rod off the rest of the way down to the next eye. I was shocked at how easy it broke. It crumbled like dust. I wonder if I just got a defective one."
4,A Blast From The Past,"Tony Orlando had the voice and the songs but was often overshadowed by excellent alternate versions by singers like Billy Fury {Halfway to Paradise), Bobby Darin {Dream Lover), Gene Pitney (To Wait for Love) and later Gerry and the Pacemakers (I'll be There). Having said all that his own versions were still great and I cannot image anyone singing 'Bless You' quite as good as Tony.The down side was that my copy of the CD had two faulty tracks, the last and second last which was not the suppliers fault but a fault in the pressing of the CD.I will wait a while and then re-order as this is still a CD that I want in my collection."
3,"Great ""menu"" for aquatic programing",I am a swim pro at a country club. I use this pamphlet as a menu for parents and kids to chose games for their birthday parties. It's great for a pool because of the laminating.
4,It is amazing what you can make with SPAM!!,"All of the dishes are easy to prepare as well as tasty. Kids especially love the main courses and appetizers. Spam is practically a staple diet of the locals in Hawaii, and you will find ""spam musubi"", soyu spam, etc. at many picnics and beach outings. Unbelievably, there are also very elegant dinners in this book, that you would not even think could be made with Spam!"
1,Don;t make the mistake I did! You're looking for something else.,"Hello.Listen. you probably saw a show called ""Ancient Aliens"" on The History Channel recently and thought it was cool, so you wanted to buy the DVD. Well, I was the same way. BUT, this isn't it! I bought this DVD and it's OLD. It just has the same name as the other one that was more recent. The one you want is also called ""Ancient Aliens"" but it hasn't come out yet. Check the History Channels website and do a search there. The cover you want has a silver UFO and a crop circle animal looking thing. I just want to save people from doing what I did."
1,A piece of junk,"Don't waste your money to buy this battery!!!!!!Even it is fully charged, it only able to take less than 10 photos or give you message ""please change the battery"". Save your money to buy canon brand which is working a lot better."
1,Doesn't perform,"I bought this replacement battery for my Canon SD20, and after charging it completely (until the green light showed up), it still said ""please change battery pack"" on my camera the moment it started running with the new battery. Turning it off and on again got it to stop sending that message, but it would instead show a low battery warning. I didn't run it until it ran out of juice, but I intend to return it because I can't take a crap shoot every time I turn on my camera."
1,Garbage!!!!,"Why doesn't Amazon have a ""no star"" rating?This piece of garbage worked great for about 2 weeks. I went on my cruise and what do you know. After charging the battery for 4 hours until the light displayed Green. Put it in my camera and took 3 pictures before the battery went dead.Good luck if you try to contact this company for warranty info. Save yourself the headache, pay the extra couple of bucks and buy an original Canon battery"
4,3M Dual Lock,"This is a great product, it does hold tight and the tape is removable. My husband uses it to hold his tray that, holds all his electronic gadgets that are needed with truck driving. I recommend this product."
2,Don't like it,"It doesn't hold anything with any weight to it and repeated use causes it to fail.I will find a use for it, probably for something small and weightless."
3,Not as good as the hype.,"This product which is somewhat similar to the hook and loop fasteners works fine. The problem is that it has been hyped so much on the WEB that I thought it would be much stronger than it really is. It seems to work a little better than the ""V"" product but not that much better."
3,"it's okay, not great","I got this to be used for some of my RC planes, various things like batteries, and receivers need to be anchored down, but need to be easy to remove as well, regular velcro is often used, and works well but losses its stick after time. I was hoping that this would be a solution to the problem but alas I'll be returning to the velcro. This stuff just isn't very strong, things pull off easily, especially with vibration, and you really have to push against it to make it stick to itself, it isn't something that it does easily. There are most likely jobs that this is better suited for than velcro, but for the very high cost you pay for this it just isn't worth it, stick with velcro."
1,Don't waste your money,"Norton old password manager worked much better. It is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites. After using it for a couple of weeks, most of the time not working properly, the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my Infovault password. Several emails to Norton and nothing but worthless repsonses. Hours wasted trying to get help from their website! Even when I just wanted to know if I unstalled the product would password manager still work, no response."
1,a Royal Mess,"I installed Norton Confidential on computer and it was a total disaster. It slowed everything to a crawl, then caused error messages that I could not get rid of. Finally it warned that it was shutting me down before the system was damaged. Then the message just sat there, it did not shut down. I finally shut down manually. This happened three times. Finally I tried to delete the program, it deleted partway, then everything hung up. After I shut down manually again, and restarted it finally finished deleting. Defraging and and clean-up took two hours. The whole process took over four hours. Now I am back up to speed and very annoyed.If I could give it a negative rating number I would"
1,less than worthless,"A pain to install, requiring more than one attempt and rebooting.Then, it slowed internet explorer to the pace of a dead turtle, even with broadband access.(It does not protect nor slow down Mozilla Firefox.)To make Windows Explorer usable, I had to un-install this program.It was one big waste of time.For me, Norton-Symantec is trashing their brand reputation with this garbage."
1,Don't Buy Norton Confidential,"You'd think you could trust Norton, but not this time. Norton Confidential is the only program that has caused my Mac G5 to crash...twice, before I uninstalled it. Alas, the damage is done, and now my Norton Antivirus doesn't work, no matter what, even after a new install.Repeat: do...not...buy...Norton Confidential."
1,Norton 2007,This is a terrible product. I could not even load the program onto my machine. I had the same 2006 version and had no trouble loading that one.I sent the product back and requested a refund to my credit card. I cannot recommend this product and if you take a chance and order it I hope that you have better luck then I did.
3,Florida Gators Helmet Desk Caddy,"I bought this desk caddy as a gift for a friend of mine who was starting a new job. When the desk caddy arrived, the packaging looked like it had been crushed on top but the helmet looked like it was ok. When my friend took the desk caddy out, it became apparent that it had some minor defects. The foam helmet lining on the inside was loose and fell out. The stripe sticker on top of the helmet was peeling off. Not sure whether this helmet had been sitting around somewhere and hadn't been stored correctly or something, but it was disappointing to have to give a gift that wasn't in perfect shape."
4,worth it,"Like the other person wrote, It's a hinge. It works well enough. I used two on one door hoping the door would latch itself when the dog came back in but it usually won't latch the door. I only rated it as a 4 because I only recently installed but mostly because the screws were a little short especially for an heavy exterior door. I went out bought longer screws. Still, these hinges are 25% the cost as the home centers."
2,Weak,"They don't seem to hold their spring tension. I have to keep readjusting to get the door to close completely, and I'm about at the end of the adjustments that I can make."
5,great item,great item. at first i was very upset i could not find nickel spring door hinges at home depot or lowes but after purchasing these i am happy i didnt because these were much easier to tighten the spring than the ones you get from the box retailers
3,does the trick,It is nice that I don't have to ask the kids to close the door all the time. My only complaint is that the spring makes a creaking noise and there is not an easy way to lubricate it.
1,Fool's gold?,"The photo shows a gold colored hinge, but these are actually silver colored. They are also advertised as made by Lawrence Brothers, Inc. of Sterling, IL., but they come in a box with no manufacturer's name and say ""Made in China."" They seem to be an okay hinge if you realize that ""nickel"" refers to the color, not to the material. If you're hoping for gold, these will just be silver."
1,Not a happy camper...,"This printer was purchased for our office. We've had it a little over a year and have had endless problems with it. In attempting to print a 10 page document, it's not unusual to get 3 - 4 paper jams! The rollers by the printer exit door cover keep coming out too. The paper does not seat well in the top paper tray, which may also be contributing to the problems. When it does print, the quality is decent and I appreciate the double sided feature. However, I would caution you strongly against this printer it's been a real headache for our department. There is another department that has the same model of printer and have also had problems with it."
3,Pretty Good,"The printer works as advertised, generally. It has an unfortunate affinity for jamming with heavier weight paper - no matter what the handbook says; but with patience it works quite well."
2,Duplexing is a problem,"If you plan on manually duplexing, expecially on 11X17, buy something else. The curl put on the paper by the heat of fusing causes the duplexed pages to hang up frequently in feeding from the trays. The only solution I have been able to find is to manually 'uncurl' the paper prior to printing the second side, which is a royal hassle."
5,Works as advertised and is cheap,"Nothing special, works well. No problems. Blue recharging LED is a little too bright for my taste, but no big deal."
1,what year is this?,"I remember seeing a lot of these in the 1970s when most decent folks didn't even know what ""horny"" meant. Now that most people are familiar with the term, why would you invite the honks of the people who would stoop to honk at such a vile sticker. Yuck. The only scenario I can think of where this would be funny would be if you stuck it on the butt of a rhinocerous."
1,Smaller than the first one,The second one I received was different from the first one and the picture but the small size will be great for taking my computer with me. Targus AWE23US Stow-N-Go Chill Mat for Laptops up to 15.6 Inches (Black).This is what I got instead of the one I ordered but it is fine with me. I do not like this for my laptop but will keep it for my Kindle and order the one I really wanted at a later time. But not from this company. I do not like that I was sent the wrong item to begin with.
1,Not worth the headache,"Unfortunately, it seems once you have downloaded NAV 2007, your whole computer will not function properly. Internet Explorer malfunctions, and I also received a blue screen (fear of crash) stating that what ever program was recently installed, I should reinstall it. I did so, but the problems did not go away. I called Norton, they told me to run in safe mode without norton. My computer was back to normal, so it was Norton causing all the problems. I unistalled it and went with another product, after spending the $60 and many hours with Norton help desk. Don't believe me, do a search on any search engine, and you will see the many problems and no apparent solutions for this program!! Up till now, I have only used Norton, and never thought twice when buying the update. I'm now moving on to another product."
4,NAV 2007 is improved over former editions,"I notice with gratitude that Symantec has removed many glitches from NAV.Installation is now faster and smoother. The program is running well in the background, updating itself and sending notifications of any attention it needs."
5,"Review by RD Larson, author of Evil Angel.","A fine book with unbelievable tenderness.Each story takes the reader on a love journey with compassion and understanding. I enjoyed every story and found that the more I read the better I liked these stories. With delicacy and wisdom each story has focus. What brings us all closer is why and how we love. In each story the lovers have faults with strengths, just like we all do. Gay love is not different and in reading these stories I could see that love changes each of us, sometimes for better and sometimes not. In reality, love is true companionship and understanding. Don't make me pick a favorite story because I liked all of them. If you haven't tried this excellent book, do so now. It is worth every moment of your reading time."
2,The Licensing Company,"Very little educational value in this title. My daughter was bored after about 15 minutes. The whole underlying game is poorly planned and very disjointed. It was slapped together quickly to cash in on the name. The background music was the best part.For this price, perhaps it will kill a rainy afternoon and get your kid smiling. But don't expect much after that.I would highly recommend the I Spy series (only two now). They are much more engaging and kids get a sense of accomplishment AND learn in the process.Oh and if you have a mac, forget it. We couuldn't get past the start menu. We have PCs in the house - it was fine on them. But don't waste your energy if you are mac only."
2,Too few activities and they are boring,"My 4 year old daughter really wants to like the game, since she is a big Strawberry Shortcake fan. However, she can only play the game for about 10 minutes before getting really bored and switching to another game. She usually plays certain preschool or kindergarten educational games for about 30 to 45 minutes, so I know it's not her attention span. Most activites in this game are too repetitive with no variations.The graphics is cute though, that's probably why my daughter still pops the CD in once in a while."
1,Only good for 5 minutes,"We bought this cd rom for my daughter who is 3. she enjoyed playing the games, but was bored very quickly. Every level is the same games and you have to play these games over and over again to earn ingrediants. Very repetive and dull."
2,A few kinks,This game is fun but not very user friendly. You can't exit one part of the game to go to another part very easily. Some games a bit difficult for the age and directions are not explained very well.
4,Nice,"Received item in a timely manner. Thought it would be more of an educational game based on the description however, it is a cute game."
3,Shortcake fell short...,I had some trouble installing the software could not get shortcut to work kept wanting to reinstall. The games are not intuitively obvious so it took some time for an adult to figure out the object of the game to explain it to my 2 year old. Some I still don't get. The graphics are great beautiful colors all the characters are there so my little one loved watching the pictures. Small Children will need an adult to play with them.
2,unhappy at (almost) every turn,"When I got this, I noticed it didn't come with cables. Seller offered a refund (nice guy). I decided to just buy the cables. After getting the cables, I went to put this in a computer, and found I was sold an AGP card, not PCI."
1,Not completely Windows 2000 compliant,"Amazon, and the box indicate that this software works under Windows 2000. Well, it only works for administrators, and the tech support won't fix the issue...I installed it as administrator, and tested that it worked.I tried running it as a restricted user. After all I don't really want my children installing software, or otherwise messing up my computer.I ran into my first problem... it couldn't write a file. So I did what I needed to... and gave users full permissions over all files under the I Spy install directory.Then I hit problem two... It refuses to run if it can't modify the system registry. Why is it trying to modify the system registry after it is installed?In any case, I don't know how the game plays - as I don't like running software as administrator. For now the disk is as useful as a coaster."
5,Great game!,My 4 yr old loves these I Spy games. Very easy to use and many hours of fun and learning!
4,Great game - wish it lasted longer!,"This game is fun for all three of our kids, aged 4 1/2 to 11. They all like looking for the items and completing the puzzles.There are 3 different areas, each area requiring a number of items to be found (just like the books). After completing the main quest for an area, it can be replayed again but with a harder set of items to find. The third time through is the hardest; then the area 'resets' back to the original level.The kids took about a week to complete the entire game. We wished there were more complexity levels than 3, or that once you've completed the 3rd complexity level you could choose to play any of them at will.A lot of fun for all of us, just wish it would've lasted longer!"
3,I Spy Fantasy,"I love I spies......I am currently waiting for I spy Christmas on cd. The I Spy was not as challanging as the last two I purchased, however entertaining. Even though I am an adult, I love playing them. The person who creates them is a genius at color and discriptive detail. I wouldn't rate this as intresting as the other."
3,I SPY FANTASY,"I love all of the ""I SPY"" books and games that I've read or played with. It is a wonderful way for a grandchild and their grandma to spend some fun time together. My 8 year old grandson gave me his ""I SPY Treasure Hunt"" because it would not work in his new computer. I just bought ""I SPY Fantasy"" and gave it to my 4 year old grandson for his birthday and he LOVES it. There are 3 different places for them to search and explore. He just can't get enough of the castle part of the game. His imagination runs wild as he collects the keys to defeat the dragon and rescue the princess! There is also an underwater adventure to find the mermaids' jewels and a space adventure. It's fun for anyone aged 4(depending on the childs' capability in using a computer) till 104!"
4,I Spy Fantasy - fantastic fun!,"Great game for a 4 to 8 year old. Fun for the adults helping too!Three different areas to explore: Space travel, Underwater adventure and medieval castle(rescuing a trapped princess, no less).A close second to the excellent 'I Spy Spooky Mansions'.One minor quibble. For the European market the designers of the game should have ditched the american kid's voice, and use a less grating English accent."
5,Great Item but refills difficult to find and run out quickly,"This toy is terrific and very easy to use. The resulting buttons are truly amazing! However, it is very difficult to find the refills and there are so few in the package, that by the time you get home, you need to go back out and find more. ... The button parts are NOT 1"" parts. They are 1 1/4"" parts; and I cannot find any online parts that fit this machine. ..."
2,an adult kid in denver,"This toy is such junk, what a disappointment. You waste all of the clear plastic discs trying to get one button done, AND the pins that hold the buttons on, really are stupid and clumsy. If you look closely on the box the buttons are attached to the kids clothes and hats with safety pins!! (Obviously I couldn't see that kind of detail from the internet picture.) So maybe the toy maker even knows how cheesey their product is! The actual button making machine was decent and it seemed sturdy. No refills were offered anywhere, so is this a one use toy!?"
5,Short Lived Fun,"This is a great toys that is easy to use and kids can be creative. BUT where in the world can you get the replacement pieces. It comes with enough for 20 button, and then what?? Bandai refers you to all the major toy stores and they don't sell them."
4,Refills,"Like a previous reviewer, the parts are used and the toy still works. BuyButtonParts.com had 1 1/4 refills for bade-a-minit with pins and they work!"
5,This toy is great.,This toy is tight! You should buy this toy. It is easy to use. Santa got it for my sister and we both love it. We have made lots of buttons for the fridge and even rings and clips.
1,It didn't even work!,The B-styli'n didn't even work when we put the design in the button maker it would not not even come out !!!!!!!!!!!!
2,good stuff,this is a good toy it looked boring but when i played eith it befoe it is not all thast fun but it still could be useale and payable but it ani't that bad
3,"It's all good, but this set is completely unnecessary.","Cee-Lo has exactly two true solo albums, as well as the 3 Goodie MOb albums he's participated in to date, not to mention his numerous guest appearances. But this set is just for the truly lazy. Both of his solo albums deserve to be heard in their entirety, as do all 3 G.MOb albums (yes, even World Party!). If this comp did anything other than compile a questionable best-of from his solos and append two admittedly standout tracks from the absolute opposite end of his career, it might be worth something. As it is, though, all this set will be good for once you've listened to it once is as a resale to someone else who's too timid to just dive in to the back catalog. Just skip the step where you waste your money on material you're just going to end up buying again soon."
3,Not a Real fan of his,I only get this for a few songs so its just okay I really wasn't a fan of solo his career
1,This is a book???,"We didn't know it was as small as a Cracker Jack prize... It's for kids, but talk about light reading, don't try to read it if the Air Conditioning comes on it will blow away!"
5,The one and only Fred Neil,"The late Fred Neil wasn't exactly well known outside Greenwich Village. The closest he came to stardom (if any) was the Nilsson interpretation of Everybody's talking on the soundtrack of Midnight Cowboy. A subtle yet significant influence on other singer-songwriters such as Bob Dylan and Tim Buckley, Neil was a reclusive person, eschewing publicity. Neil passed away in 2001, leaving a legacy that surpasses his songs.This album is comprised of earlier released live tracks available on Other side of this life and The many side of Fred Neil. But it also includes four tracks only available on folk compilations including one, The sky is falling, wich has never been available anywhere else (unless the Raven release of August has some surprises). This makes the album a must for anybody who takes folkmusic and singer-songwriters to heart."
5,Near perfect,"This is another fantastic release from Cher's ""Living Proof"" album. Thunderpuss does a brill job on the Sunrise mix, Almighty reconstructs it into a dance anthem, and Illicit, as usual, turns out a FANTASTICO disco mix. The only things missing are:InstrumentalA CapellaDiego Garcia Edit (Check it out at ACIDPlanet.com)DG Full MixRecommended."
5,A compelling look at a unique intellectual era,"No idea stood beyond the reach of some intellectual niche in Victorian England. Behind the common conception of conformity and prudishness was a spectacular diversity of mind and inclination, willing to follow any idea to its logical conclusions. A.N. Wilson does a marvelous job of bringing it all to life in a sober and compelling way, showing that the individuals at the intellectual heart of 19th century England slowly slipped out of the medieval cloak of theism as the full consequences of Darwinian theory and the scientific revolution became evident. I read this right after ""Age of Reason"" and before ""Calling Bernadette's Bluff."" My mind has been humming with gratitude ever since."
1,Useless,"This has such slippery rubber that I was unable to get anything tightened more than finger-tight using it. I bought it to help me install a vacuum breaker, but it added nothing to my efforts."
5,very sturdy device,"Great for opening the tough or hard to open cans, or hard to budge valves. Essential for the DIY guys toolbox."
4,Good little gym bag.,Good little bag. Well made. Several compartments. Double zippers all around so that you can put small locks on them if you need. Great value.
4,"Functional, fine small gym bag","The bag is just like I expected after reading the description and reviews: it is fairly well made (no loose threads or missed stitches), looks decent (but isn't going to win any awards), has useful features like the shoe/wet towel section (if your shoes aren't too big like my size 12's!), and is a perfect size for the things you want to take to the gym (but not enough for a weekend getaway). A solid deal and probably one of he best options you'll find in this price range. If only the bag had some magic way to force me to go to the gym more often..."
3,I Am Missing The End Of The Series....,"Disks #1 & 2 were great. But Disk #3 was a ""coaster"": no sound, could not read the subtitles, and it turned my DVD player into a zombie. The only button that worked on the remote was the power button. And this was the 2 hour Finale! I am sad that I will not see the end of the series, as I have all 11 seasons and it is one of my favorite TV shows."
3,good variety of colors,"There were 12 Love My Nails brand bottles of polish, including one duplicate color and one a clear base coat, 5 Nina brand items, including a hardener polish, 1 Milani french manicure polish, 1 Igia ridge filler, and one Pink Ice polish, which seemed half empty and the brush was broken. Still, I would says a nice variety and not a terrible price. Free shipping offered. I noticed the price had gone up a bit since I bought this package. The ""list price"" of this package is ridiculous at $129 for brands that usually run about .99 cents?! That's creative marketing for ya."
4,"Not salon quality, but still a good value","I bought this set with the intent of playing ""spa"" with my daughters. I received only 1 top coat. The other 19 bottles are inexpensive enamels. I am very happy with the selection. There were at least 5 metal shades, 3 shades of blue, a green, a yellow, several pinks, purples, and reds. The variety pleased me and my daughters. The quality of the polish, though, is not of high quality. My 3yo chose one of the blues. She had 2 applications and no top coat. She took a bath and half of the polish had washed away. I, on the other hand, used a platinum shade (very pretty white metal look) and it is holding up very well. For this price and my purpose, this was an awesome purchase."
2,Just looking at the picture... Don't buy it!,"Wow Salon quality... not so much. I have not purchased this product and won't but, just from the picture I can tell you the brand in the back (1st picture) is a $1 store brand. (2nd picture) Love my nails the second picture shown is one of the worst dollar store brands as well."
1,colors,"i ordered this and i got top coats about 6, pinks about 7 and reddish browns about 7, no other colors. i know it says assorted colors but assorted of the same colors, i will not ever order this again. i will go to the store"
3,Little disappointed,"Need to do better on shipping. Putting 20 bottles of polish in a envelope with nothing to protect bottles doesn't work very well. When I received this order, there were 3 broken bottles of polish. Polish was everywhere."
3,Bad packing,I received this order with 2 of the bottle were spill all over the box and other bottles what a mess I love colorsBut was not impress with shipping.
5,super,"I was very satisfied with this order, originally I bought it for my sister in law but I was so thrilled with the colors that I bought a set for myself too. Not to mention that all the bottles made it to me without any damage. I'm so pleased that I'm telling everyone that I know about it. Variety was very good everything from pinks to purples and some fun summery colors too. Fantastic job!!"
3,Cheap quality!,"What can I say? I got 20 pieces..but 90% were brands I'd never buy. I guess it was a fair price for what I bought, but I can't say I was happy."
2,colors were nice but bottles were broken,"The colors were nice and the assortment was good, but 3 bottles arrived broken. What a mess! They threw the bottles all together in a box with almost no packing material. Unbelievable. It's hard to imagine anyone being so careless.As for quality, they're just your average polish. I paid $18 for the set, so that's about a buck a bottle after breakage."
2,Broken bottle,One of the bottles broke and it went on practically all of the other bottles. I had planned on giving the whole set to my sister for Christmas but was only able to salvage half of the since I could not remove the nail polish stain that had already set on the other bottles. I was very disappointed that the nail polish bottles were not packaged better.
4,A blessing from the past,This CD contains Don Franciso's best! The storytelling he does through his music is wonderful. The music takes me back to the beginnings of Christian contemporary music. What an amazing time! This CD is a total joy to listen to.
5,Nice!,"High quality, light weight and the lid is a plus. Handles fold in to make it compact and weight makes it a perfect piece to carry when hiking."
4,Great Service,"The book took a while to get here, but it did get here and with no problems. I emailed the merchant and things were handled real quick."
5,Awesome for treating and preventing eczema!!!,"I suffer from eczema and I have been to 3 or 4 dermatologists and every topical treatments that my doctors have prescribed never work or make my situation worse. I always end up scratching until I bleed and it was just a very distracting problem that I have to deal with. One night, my mother thought I should rub some vaseline on my ""scratched-up"" skin to maybe sooth the inflammation on my arms and legs. The next day, I actually noticed the inflammation had gone down and I just could not believe vaseline actually worked better than the expensive prescription creams that my doctors had prescribed for me! Also, I rub vaseline on areas that I would always rash and it has been several months now and my eczema has actually been healing faster than usual. Wonderful product!"
3,"Great Product, But Can Find Better Deal","I love Vaseline as an overnight face mask and as an eye makeup remover. However, you can get three 13 oz tubs for about $11-16 on Amazon.com. So, if you're looking to get the best bang for your buck, that's probably the better value, especially if you use a lot of the stuff.Note that 13 oz tubs are huge though. One will probably take me over a year to get through, and I use it regularly. Fortunately, petroleum jelly has a very long shelf life."
2,Leave well alone!,"Maybe I missed the point here, but I found Piratica III, The Family Sea horribly disappointing. I'm a big fan of the previous two, and this one - textually - is just a cunningly written, but thematically I found it a full betrayal of the core values found in Piratica, and Piratica II. Family Sea is sketchy and uncohesive, with too many threads awkwardly linked, too many characters picked up, then discarded, and the ending makes me wish that the author had never written a third at all, but left it at the two. The love story between Art and Felix is abandoned without a second thought about a chapter into the book, and even the wonderful camraderie between Art and her fellow pirates is completely lacking. I want NOT to have read this book - not only because I found it tedious, but because having read it, it has now coloured and corrupted my enjoyment of the previous two. Steer clear!"
3,Alot of white space,"This book contains some good information about spells but doesnt say alot about the history of the craft. It had quite a bit of blank space throughout the book but what was there was good.Merry Meet, Merry Part and Merry Meet Again.Blessed Be~"
5,this book rocks,This book is wonderful and I have no negative comments about it. I think this book would be perfect for anyone. It has a lot of information on witchcraft for beginners.Take my advice:its worth the money. Guinevere writes this book in an easy to understand manner for all ages.
2,"I'm sorry, I cannot agree.","The book isn't horrible, but there's a few reasons I simply can't trust this.Miss Rain states she found Wicca at 14 years old. She started writing the book around 16-17. Of everybody I've consulted to confirm my suspicion, 2 or 3 years isn't long enough to get enough experience -yourself- let alone teach others. Plus, like was said, it's a ""cookbook."" Gwinevere, in her writings (I saw an article about her), never says much about the religion of Wicca, she concentrates on spells as if it's the only thing there is."
4,Perfect for the young spellcaster,"I bought this book for my daughter, who'd just started out on her path in the last few years. We study and work together, but I wanted her to have her own books that were more geared towards her age. This was a perfect choice! The writing is simple without being too ""dumbed down"". It's easy to follow, has just enough information to get a young spellcaster started and give them an idea of what they might want to learn more about. Great book for tweens or early teens."
5,Surprisingly Good For The Money,"I've owned this for several years, I think I bought it at PepBoys originally, I find I end up using it more than my higher quality craftsman screwdrivers, just because it's a great all-in-one screwdriver. The magnetic tip works well and the telescoping feature is handy. My one complaint is that it can be easy to lose the bits - it would be nicer if they were stored in the handle."
1,Smells like gasoline,"This screwdriver is alright, but its stinks like gasoline. I don't know if its because of the rubber handle, or it was caught in a fuel spill,buts its awful, makes this unusable as a tool indoors."
1,What a drag it is,"Hands down, Bruce Bethke's Headcrash was the worst book I read in 1997. Everything about it is derivative, from the title (see Neal Stephenson's far wittier and more biting cyperpunk satire, Snow Crash), to the plot (a mish mash of elements from Snow Crash and Neuromancer, tied together with pathetic attempts at Dilbertian organizational humor). I cannot imagine how this novel was nominated for anything, let alone won it could have won the Philip K. Dick award. Headcrash is neither funny nor entertaining. As soon as I finished plodding through this ill-written mess, it went straight to a trash can.Selden Deemer, CybrarianAtlanta, Georgia"
1,Philip K. Dick is rolling over in his grave,"This is an awfully written, witless book. The fact that it won the Philip K. Dick Award strips the prize of any credibility it used to have. The beginning is entertaining, but unoriginal: virtually every joke was stolen from the comic strip Dilbert. After the protagonist is fired and no longer works in an office, the author is forced to steal jokes from somewhere else. Apparently he couldn't think of any other place to steal from, because the middle third of the book scarcely advances the plot while keeping the unthinking masses satiated with juvenile oral sex anecdotes and euphemisms for the word ""penis."" The climax hinges on a bunch of ludicrous coincidences that would make the literary god of stupid coincidences, Charles Dickens, roll his eyes. The ending is the only part that satirizes cyberpunk, with lines like ""We'll get them in the sequel."" Don't read this garbage."
3,"Good, but not the best","It was great when you got into it, but the begining was a little confusing and the ending was bad. Otherwise it was great!"
1,"Stuff so lame should be pilloried, not rewarded","Bruce Bethke managed to write a mostly unfunny novelization of three or four Dilbert strips. The book was relevant for some two weeks, I guess, and they were gone before the hardcover edition saw the light of day (perhaps the reviewers at the publishing house read the manuscript at that time?). The protagonist is an unmitigated, weapons-grade J.E.R.K. with the declared IQ of two million and the tested one around minus ten. Other characters rustle when moving around - they're paper, not even cardboard. The ""reality"" of 2005 is more like June 3, 1994, with snazzy car names. All in all, forget you saw this book. Buy something else, a Coke, a burger, anything would be healthier - even a pack of untipped Gauloises. The environmental impact would be smaller, too."
2,I am sorry I bought it,Very disappointing. Did not live up to expectations generated by the reviews I read at Amazon.com. Started with a good idea but awkward plot development and juvenile style
4,The best book.... EVER.,"This book has to be THE funniest cyber-SF book I have ever read. Unlike some others, I LIKED the ending, I understand what the author was thinking when he wrote it, but to put it down here would be to exceed my 1000 word limit. I recomend this book to EVERYONE who can read."
4,"Good book, but the ending is like a GPF",The book is worth your time!! It is on my shelf next to Microserfs and Snowchrash. The ending lives up to the title--it stops and you want more.
1,Cyber-SF not my bag.,"I found the book funny to start, then the humor started be seem a little forced. The story line was intriguing, but became increasingly lame. The ending I thought was the stupidness one I have ever read. I've come to the conclusion that I don't really like cyber-SF very much. I gave both 'Snow Crash' and 'Neuromancer' fairly low ratings."
3,In-your-interface type humor,"It's funny, but not in a Douglas Adams way, more like a Three Stooges way. I don't see it as a Dick winner, or a Neb winner, but it is strong for a first novel. It does a wonderful job of poking fun at the cyberpunk genre with their completely implausible interfaces and wierd special effects. It has a really good twist at the end. So all in all I recomend it, but not as a must buy"
5,a generally even-handed treatment,"Overall, an excellent book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. My only complaint is that the author might a bit too uncritically accept vivisectors' claims about the human payoffs of their research. Near the end she does briefly discuss some of the failures of animal research and the cost that has been paid in terms of human suffering and death, but much of her earlier discussion is not informated by the latter."
3,"A ""balanced"" approach?","It is a bit curious that this book as been described as balanced. This book, as another reviewer mentioned, does not question whether science done on animals and especially primates has produced much valuable, life-changing, society-changing research. She has very few examples of the ways in which animal testing has resulted in useful discoveries with the exception of polio, which she shows nearly decimated an an entire monkey population for the sheer number of monkeys imported for use. Science, as an institution and discipline, is treated with kid-gloves here. The amorphous thing of scientific curiosity, regardless of the suffering it causes and the lack of useful result, is posed as an inalienable human right. The balanced approach that the book purports to take seems a product of a desire for a happy ending--those for and against animal testing really can get along!"
3,Eternal Elysium - 'Share' (Meteor City) 3 1/2 stars,"Recorded at Studio Zen in Nagoya, Japan. It's the stoner metal trio's first CD - think I like their second effort 'Spiritualized D' (see my review) a bit better. Tracks that sort of make this CD a keeper for those 'major fans' include ""Feel The Beat"", the nine-minute ""Waiting For The Sun"", the TOTAL *ss-kicking ""Love Is All"" and ""Dogma"". While not exactly a mind-blower 'Share' would be decent for newcomers to listen to the very first time late at night."
5,"An eye-opening, uproarious account","An expert on the American western frontier and drawing from memoirs and eyewitness accounts, Sherry Monahan's The Wicked West: Boozers, Cruisers, Gamblers, And More provides the reader with a no-nonsense accounting of the ""sinful"" ways of the Wild West, in an era when drinking, smoking, gambling, drugs, and prostitution were the order of the day. Told chiefly through the memoirs and eyewitness accounts of the men and women who lived ""the wicked life"" in boisterous times, The Wicked West peels away legends to give an astonishingly accurate picture of the dangers, diseases, and forbidden pleasures of a time and place when anything could happen and usually did. An eye-opening, uproarious account."
1,Do not bother,"This movie was slow, disjointed in the plot and not scary. The plot did not follow and make sense. I was left thinking ""what?"" most of the time. Do not bother."
4,"""Edward F. Beale & The American West""","Of the scant number of books on the amazing Beale (a.k.a. the Forest Gump of the 19th century) this is the most definitive. The book is well written and most painstakingly researched. The notes are easily interpreted and the bibliography complete. Edward Fitzgerald Beale seems to be a person lost in the time warp. Yet he was one the largest players in American Industry, and politics and one of the wealthiest men of the 19th century. He is the man who started the 49'ers gold rush. I strongly recommend the Univ. of New Mexico Press's ""Edward F. Beale & The American West"" by Gerald Thompson. Its a find!"
1,Meh....,"Just shadows of dancers dancing somewhat erotic dances behind flames to odd music. Not what we wanted. We wanted this for a tween party, so it was definitely inappropriate. But it was also dumb. Wouldn't use it for an adult party, either."
5,Great Visuals For My Adult Sexy Halloween Costume Party,"This is great, Halloween is once a year when we adults get a chance to entertain the kids and also let our hair down, get dressed up crazy and have a great time with our friends. We drink and dance the night away and see who wins the sexiest, most daring, crazy and scariest costume. These visuals will really set the scene. I went to a party at a hotel last year and the baseball was on tv WTF? It's Halloween people. Get in the party mood, you always regret it if you don't. Wish they had this on DVD but download will be fine, we can use it every year."
4,Quotes from Henry Drummond's Famous Books,"""You will find as you look back upon your life, that the moments that stand out, the moments when you have really lived, are the moments when you have done things in a spirit of love."" ~ Henry Drummond""Beautiful Thoughts"" is a book of Henry Drummond's thoughts from many of his famous books. I think this book will be most appreciated by readers who have read his other books first. I had actually collected a few of his quotes before but didn't realize who Henry Drummond was. This Scottish evangelist had a lot of good things to say and was very wise. I look forward to reading more of his books in the near future.~The Rebecca Review"
1,V37 made me go back to paper dayrunner,"I used to have an Ipaq and loved it - My job handed out the ViewSonic V37's and only allowed them to be connected to computers/networks.The V37 locks up, from turn on to actual use is 30+ seconds, not real fun when your trying to use it to manage your schedule, book an appt, or just look at your calendar for the day.I found it slow, unresponsive and have given it back. I would rather use a paper planner - viewsonic killed my love of the pocket pc. My next purchase will be a pda/phone/all in one type. Money is no option - quality and performance counts and I did not like the V37. Sell it for scrap......."
3,Can't Upgrade Operating System,"There are data syncing issues with this model and other strange behaviors. Unfortunately Viewsonic is no longer offering an upgrade to Pocket PC 2003 which should fix some of these issues. Here is the response from their technical support: ""The PPC 2003 upgrade CD for the Pocket PC V37 is no longer in production."". I personally would not purchase anything that can't be upgraded! Buyer beware! The screen resolution is not that great either."
5,Viewsonic PPC After one year,"I've owned two IPAQs, and several PALMs. This is the best little gadget I ever had. The screen is so bright that even battery-saving settings are clear. Battery life is good, almost 4 hours continuous. Having a Flash Memory and an SD card I record music, books and games. You can listen to headphones and read a book at the same time for hours!"
1,DON'T BUY VIEWSONIC V37,"If you buy this pda and your battery stops charging you'll lose it. THERE IS NO WHERE ON THIS PLANET (I mean it), NOT A SINGLE STORE where you can find the BP8BULXBIAP1 battery. Viewsonic DISCONTINUED the V37 and the manufacturer in Taiwan won't bother to reply. Once the battery dies, you'll lose your pda. I have one, unfortunately. Buy another brand, so when the battery dies you can just get a new one, like that on your fingers."
4,"Viewsonic - battery not that bad, very good PDA vs iPaqs","Regarding the previous review concerning battery anomalies - they can be fixed. However, all PDA's have problems with dumping memory when the battery runs out. You will learn how long your PDA lasts given your personal use, and how often you must overnight-charge it (or use a travel charger).I've had many Pocket PC's - this is the fastest, lightest, easiest to use that I have tried. Much better than many of the iPaqs.More info at the Yahoo group:http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ViewSonic/"
1,Just for trash,"This product don't work propertly, i try cover guaranty in a local technical service, but say the product is category C don't have any guaranty.This product just for trash."
5,.......yeeeeeaaa,"This is a very cool booster pack. It has very good cards such as Mage Power, United We Stand, Destiny Board, and Gemini Elf (1900 atk with no drawbacks). But if you look at it closely, you can see that there is sort of a theme for each expansion. This expansion is based on masks :). So I hope you enjoy this set of booster packs!"
2,Yu-Gi-Oh Labrinth of Nightmare 36 Pack Booster Bundle,great cards but low quality. i spent all my $$$ for this and i am not satisfied. not thaat fun educational or durible i would say this is a no no.
4,Good for the money but...,"The photos on the site are representative of the cage and the quality is as expected. The assembly was more intuitive than necessary because the instructions are nothing but a bad drawing with no text and the picture on the outside of the box is a dark mess... so, refer to this website for photos of how it should look -- and you will need a helper to hold the seed-guard while putting it together. It will also help if you have small fingers to hold the nuts through the bars while screwing it all together. There was some damage to the box and some parts where bent, but not bad enough that plyers could not fix. Overall it is a good value. The 57 inch height is to the top perch, not the top of the cage itself, so calculate accordingly."
2,not the greatest band,bought this for my husband for christmas last year and it's broken twice... just the band but it's still annoying to have to deal with that.. the first time was when he'd only worn it for a couple WEEKS! the face and mechanical part is wonderful and very heavy duty but i wasn't so happy with the band..
2,Big let down,Not worth the price. I really like this author's books but her mass market books have better plot and characters. For the price I was pretty let down. This book could be more 2 and half stars but I still can't feel it was worth what I paid. All I can say is if you are interested and out of futuristic romances to read try the ebook version if there is one.
4,Good Vacuum,"My wife likes this, we had one already and the power nozle broke, you CAN NOT get this part unless you pay like 120$, I searched all over the internet and found it better to buy this re-conditioned vacuum for a few more dollars, now I can have back up parts if anything happens again. Other than that issue we like how light and quiet it is and how easy it is to take on the stairs, that's the main reason I dropped the the upright we bought at walmart which was an $80 clunker by Eureka, it's heavy and the accessories fall off, we hated it."
4,Key part missing in this nice pocket guide,The details of how to use the patterns was very professional. I feel I could produce fish with every one of them. The mid-west review leads a person to beleive patterns are included. Only a shopping list is included for each fly. A novice tyer will need to spend some time finding directions for tying each fly. An extra 10 pages would have saved some of us a lot of work and made the book complete.
3,40 Best Trout Flies,"40 Best Trout FliesThis text was more specific than its title, which is the reason for the low rating. I thought I was purchasing a book on ""Tying"" the 40 Best Trout Flies which the title does not state, however, the title also does not state the book IS about ""Fishing"" the 40 Best Trout Flies either. I will however focus my attention on reviewing what the book IS written about.This is a well written text about how to use 40 different Trout Flies in all the conditions they were meant to be used. Each fly is broken down into its own category and why it was developed by its creator along with how it is fished. These details are extremely good, and if a fisherman were to follow them (in the Northern sections of the USA) where trout live year round, he will find himself in fish. I do not recommend this text for southerners like myself however, who rarely see the northern rivers and streams."
3,an arcade game,"This is an arcade game for youngsters, which means there is really no educational value -- just repetitive action: jumping, throwing and some short term planning about where to jump and when to throw.IMHO, kids will get to these kind of games soon enough. I'm not in a rush to introduce mindless arcade-style entertainment. That said, the game is stable and installs easily."
4,So far its a great deal!,"Just received it today. Set up was a snap and it handled like a dream-lightweight and good consistent suction.While it looks like a toy and doesn't really have any special features, it seems to get the job done. It effortlessly cleaned my carpets and seating which were embedded with cat hair. The best part was I didn't have an allergy attack like usual when I clean. While I was willing to spend up to $600. for a vacuum, it was hard to find a very light one with attachments. This fits the bill, literally, and its quite a savings. Hope it holds up over the long haul."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING,Worst of the lot- after ONE WEEK was spitting out more than it was taking in. The bags I had to order ONLINE only and paid $25 shipping for 3 pks. of bags!! RETURNED IT!
5,It reveals the answer to all students' study problems!,"The inventory is exactly right and could not be more accurate. It is helpful not only to me as a student, but also to me as a future educator. It helps to understand how you learn along with others around you! It is wonderful!"
3,expected more from it,"This cookbook is pretty weak in terms of flavor...I noted that I was constantly substituting and adding ingredients to try and jazz up bland recipes. The recipes definitely lack oomph...if you are looking for an easy to follow cookbook and you don't mind sacrificing flavor for time saving, then tis is the cookbook for you. If you are a more experienced cook or you expect delicious results, I would not get this one."
4,Vegetarian Cookbook,"This cookbook has many very tasty recipes and it also has information about the things that you need to eat in order to be healthy, depending on age and health. I am very pleased with it. The only thing that I wish that it had are more pictures of the finished products."
2,Uninspiring and bland,"Recipes are either too bland or filled with way too many ingredients and steps. Also, there are only 16 photographs -- it's a chore to read through all the recipes to find one to try, and then when you try it, it's too complicated and doesn't pack much punch for your efforts. I much prefer lots of beautiful photos to choose from and to be inspired from. I just don't have hours to pore over a cookbook with no illustrations and recipes that are twice as long as they should be!"
3,I expected...,"...this cookbook to be a bit larger in size and full of color photos. It was more like a hardback novel. That is what disappointed me. The recipes are great though, and I've already started using recipes from the book!"
4,Pretty Good Cookbook,"I have not had this cookbook very long but so far I have liked what I've made. The Black Bean and Corn enchiladas were good, and the Black Bean chili pot pie was AMAZING. Some of the recipes on my queue are Apricot Almond Sorbet, Spicy Stuffed Sweet Potatoes, Mexican Lasagna, Garden Po' Boy, and the Black Bean and Grilled Vegetable Tacos. It has an easy to navigate index and even some color photo's. There ARE quite a few recipes in this book I will never try (such as items with fake meats and tofu - due to GMO's and such), but enough that I do want to try to make it worth it. Overall it's no Jeanne Lemlin cookbook - but I'm glad I have it."
4,Many interesting recipes,"i found many recipes that i would like to try, but have not tried any yet. Based on my initial review I would recommend this as a good cookbook to get started with vegetarian cooking."
3,Vegan cookbook,I was told that the cover jacket was in excellent shape. The book was slightly dented and the cover jacket was badly wrinkled. I wrote to the seller about this issue and did not get a response.
4,Hours of challenging trivia questions over a very wide range of topics,"This collection of quizzes containing trivia covers a wide spectrum of topics, from sports to television to mythology to history. Answers to all the questions are included in the back and this book will keep you thinking for hours, as long as you don't cheat. Each has a rating system where you can rank your score. I found it to be a lot of fun."
2,Poor design - not recommended,"I purchased this adapter couple weeks ago to connect a firewire audio device to my new Mac Book. It works fine, so no complaints there. However, when you attach the firewire 400 cable end to this adapter, the two becomes pretty long, so it gets really easy to tilt it up/down/right/left when it's connected to the laptop. So, it becomes really difficult to move your laptop when this is connected. Not only it can get disconnected easily, which I've already experienced couple times, it can actually DAMAGE your firewire 800 port if you don't be too careful.After having this problem, I made more search and found another similar adapter built by Moshi, where the two jack are separated by a short cable, so it can give much more flexibility, so I'm about to buy that. I do not recommend this product of Sonnet."
3,JD Roth web stuff,"I initially ordered this from JDRoth because I needed an adapter for my Mac. I was able to find it locally at a much cheaper price than what they offered. It was a protracted process getting them to credit my return in terms of waiving the re-stocking fee(when I never opened the package) I think that they should say up front on the web page when they advertise items what their policies are instead of the customer having to go to their web site to find this out. I also had to pay to send this item back to them, so I am not happy that they would not reimburse the shipping. I will not be ordering from them again."
1,firewire adaptor,"I bought this to connect an Epson R1800 printer to my MacBook Pro. I don't know why, but the computer couldn't see the printer with this connection. So, it didn't work at all for what I needed."
1,It doesn't work,"Nothing that uses FW400 responds to being plugged into this device, whether is it bus powered or not.Bloody useless"
2,800 to 400?? 400 to 800??,"I need an adaptor to plug a 800 cable into a 400 plug. I got just the opposite. Okay, i have enouh cables, I can switch configuration. Once I got that done, I started getting multiple ""you have unplugged this device without warning"" errors. Found out that the end of the sonnet cable has a flare to it that prevents two cords from being plugged into together."
4,It works,"It works. I'm using it to transfer digitized slide film images from a Nikon scanner and am getting clean, sharp images. It's not an absolutely tight fit so care must be taken, particularly with the Nikon's thick Firewire cord, to keep the plug centered in the socket -- bumping the cord can cause a loss of connection. But if you set things up right, it won't budge on its own. And you can't beat the price!"
5,Worked Like A Champ,I only used this once with the migration manager to move data and settings from a Mac mini to a MacBook Pro. Worked just like it was supposed to.
5,Works like a charm,"Needed to connect a Gen1 iPod w/firewire 400 to my Mac with Firewire 800. Worked like a charm, iTunes recognized the dusty old iPod instantly..."
2,Not Good Enough,"I wanted to use this device for connecting a firewire sound card to my Macbook Pro (OS 10.5).The sound that comes out of the card was garbled and distorted. So I tried something else.I tried to use it to connect a DV video camera to my Macbook, so that I could rip the footage into Final Cut Pro.Final Cut could not detect the camera, nor could it capture video.Both the sound card and the camera are in working order, and serve me well when connected to my PowerPC G5. The Sonnet FireWire 400 to 800 Adapter, however, has failed in every critical way.I hope that another device can succeed where this one has failed.Two stars because it actually produced some sound from my Firewave, though it was totally unlistenable. It wasn't completely dead, just inadequate."
1,Useless,"The 800 slot in this adapter could not hold the 800 plug, which kept working its way outward and falling out. Spend just a little more and get a 400-800 cable. My adapter has gone to the dump and good riddance."
1,Didn't work,"It has the wrong connectors- needs a male 400, (for computer) & male 800, (for the device). Had to buy a whole new cable since they apparently don't make the adapter I needed."
4,"works well, one minor puzzler if you're using a Drobo / FW400 CF reader","The Sonnet adapter, though pricey for a little piece of plastic, works well, and I'm pleased that I'm again able to use my old Lexar FW400 CF card reader after Apple eliminated the FW400 port(s) on the latest desktop Macs. However, I have my Firewire devices (two FW800 hard disks and a Drobo with FW800) daisy-chained, as is customary, and the Lexar wouldn't work as the last device in the chain if the Drobo was right before it. I switched the daisy-chain order of the hard drives around, ultimately plugging the Sonnet (and thus the Lexar reader) into one of the regular (LaCie) FW800 drives. The Sonnet adapter, again at the end of the chain, now works fine. The initial glitch might be the Sonnet's fault, or it might have something to do with the Drobo, not sure -- but I figured a couple of people out there would like to know and save themselves some headscratching and hassle."
5,Totally Easy to Use,"The only FireWire port in my computer is an 800 so I thought that I would have to buy a Firewire400 card to plug into my motherboard in order to be able to use a FW400 external drive that I have. Then I discovered the Sonnet adapter. No extra FireWire card needed, and no hassle. I just plugged the Sonnet adapter my existing FW800 port and then plugged my harddrive's FW400 cable into the Sonnet unit. No settings, no software to install. I just plugged it in, and it worked! :)"
4,Works well for some things,"I used this to connect my fw400 monitor cable to my fw800 only new mac. It works fine for my old (no desire to replace) fw400 compact flash card reader, which I now just plug into the monitor's fw400 link.But I also tried it out as an option to use to connect my fw400 canon scanner to the computer, and it did not work with this or with the fw400 to fw800 cable I also tried out. Ended up using the scanner's USB 2.0(?) link instead. So, basically ymmv on how useful this is.(And it's several bucks cheaper as I type, less than a month later. Amazon can be so annoying sometimes.)"
5,a plug is a plug is a plug,you can't ask for more.. or less.. a plug is a plug.you can ask for it to work.. and it will
2,didnt work after 2 weeks and they even denied me a refund for this item,not worth the moneydied in 2 weeks and u dont get a replacement or yr money back
5,perfect for my need,"I needed to transfer everything to a new computer. Old computer had Firewire 400,new one Firewire 800. No one seemed to have a cable for this. Adapter did the job and the cost was so reasonable. Could not ask for a better tool or a better price. Perfect!!!!!!"
2,NO MORE DUST!! But no more stopping either.,"These are FANTASTIC for having no brake dust!But in getting no dust, you also get no stopping power!They are pretty noisy, sounds like a grinding noise and you don't get a nice gradual braking, just a lot of noise and nothing and then WHOA it rips your face off.I'm semi please."
4,"Beautiful, leaves me wanting more (like a longer disc!)","I loved the themes and moods, compositions are breathtaking. It is too short, and we need a longer disc from these guys. Until then I strongly reccommend you get this."
2,Miracle LST09B Flat Panel Display,I don't have much to say about this display because it didn't work for me at all. It wasn't a plug and play that was for sure because it didn't work with my OQO 02 like I had hoped.Sent back couldn't use
3,Not well-made,"After only two days of play, my little Bichon had opened one of the little connecter rods and pulled out its stuffing."
5,Worked for us,"I bought this for my first maltese when she was a puppy. While it is not a chew toy and shouldn't be used as such, she did chew on it quite a bit when she was teething. Our older yorkie at the time liked it too. Since then we've bought two yorkies and one Maltese, all of whom used it when they were teething. We still have it, it never tore or anything, and the three dogs we have now play with it. None of our dogs have ever been particularly destructive or even chewed after they grew out of their teething phase, though. So it's not for animals who have a tendency to be rough with their toys and especially not for larger breeds. Our dogs just play fetch and such with it."
2,"Looks very cute, but won't last.","You will love this toy. So will your dog. However, unless your dog is a very young puppy, this toy will not live very long in your household at all. In fact, it won't live long even if your dog is a very young, small puppy. My 11 week old, 1.5 pound Yorkshire Terrier puppy absolutely loves this toy and has played with it every day. After about 6 days the stuffing is already tearing out of one of the little balls. It's unfortunate because this really is a wonderful shape for a toy, it is just not made of sturdy materials at all and even if used only as a fetching toy it will not last long at all. Pestages has many other high quality dog toys that last much longer than this."
2,hmm,"The content of this book was very good. I've always loved Candace Camp books, but the condition of the book was unacceptable. The book was rated to be Very good condition, but when I received the book it was stained and some pages were ripped out. I was very disappointed with this. Be sure to check on the score of the companies that you buy from."
3,"A little paranormal, a little mystery, a little romance","Pleasing, but not worth hardcover prices. The strong paranormal elements were interesting, but sometimes veered into ""too convenient."" Theo is a thoroughly pleasant man, but not a memorable hero. Megan is a strong, smart woman, but only slightly more memorable. Her sister is actually a more memorable character. The murder mystery takes precedence over the romance.Pleasant, but I wish I'd gotten it from the libary or waited for the paperback. The tone and content of this review mirror my enthusiasm for the book -- nothing to get worked up over."
3,This book has alittle bit of everything but not enough romance,"This was my first Candance Camp book and it was alright. It wasn't anything extraoridnary but it was a good read. The plot has everything from murders, kidnapping, lost civilizations, religious cults, to paranormal visions/dreams. One thing though that I didn't like about this book is that there is only one breif descriptive love scene where they go all the way. I prefer my historical romances to have at least 2-3 good loves scenes. Even though the characters are head-over-heels for eachother, sometimes the story is lacking in romance. Also, I found the whole 'paranormal time travel/dreams/visions' aspect to be alittle cheesy. Overall, An Unexpected Pleasure earns 3 1/2 stars in my opinion."
1,Disgusting,"Don't support this hateful disgusting person! Morrissey's comments about President Bush and his insensitivity towards the death of President Reagan show just what a scum this guy really is. I don't care what your political leanings are, it's wrong to wish death on anyone, even worse it's disgusting to celebrate in someones passing. Morrissey you are the lowest!"
4,"Sharp, funny, inappropriate","Thanks be. Morrissey has recovered his sense of humor and realizes that anger is best served with a spice of bite. He manages to make a mockery of lesser talents by employing his unusual rhyme schemes and line delivery like the machine gun he holds in the cover photo. He can make an ex-pat like me feel the loss of home in songs like ""Come Back to Camden,"" and weigh the whole love/hate aspect of living in the US with the kind of aplomb that he hasn't had access to for years. I bought this album with hope in my heart because the past few were sketchy. And now my heart is full."
5,"Come on, Amazon.","""America is not the World"" is one of the best tracks on this whole album, yet you aren't letting people sample it?This album is nothing less than perfect. Morrissey has once again proven that he IS the best singer/songwriter, and that he is one of the smartest men living."
5,Subversive,Great CD. Well worth the money. Thankfully Morrissey has a huge following so these insepid reviews wont matter. Does anyone really decide to buy something based on these subjective reviews? Not I.
5,What an unbelievable comeback!,"Ok, we all loved him and have since weathered years of uncertainty, waiting out the passing phases and shirking overnight stays of passerby band mates...but this really is a second coming. This album is at least the level of ""Your Arsenal,"" if not ""Bona Drag"" or ""Viva Hate."""
3,It's Good....but not Great,"I've been listening to Morrissey since the ""Peel Sessions"" from The Smiths. That's about 20 years....so I know when Morrissey is on top form. Viva Hate was absolutely award winning, this CD is not. Don't get me wrong, Morrissey sounds great...but the lyrics and music leave you feeling like there should have been something more to it. It's like listening to Bona Drag after Viva Hate, and wondering what happened. I would have thought after 7 years, he could have done a bit better. There are probably 3-4 really good songs, but the rest are just filler....with Morrissey's voice to make them a slight bit better. I know there are those of you that think Morrissey can do no wrong.....but it just ain't true. This is a good album and not a great one. Be sure to get it on sale like I did."
4,"Morrissey ""You Are The Quarry""","""America Is Not The World"" 5/5""Irish Blood, English Heart"" 5/5""I Have Forgiven Jesus"" 4/5""Come Back To Camden"" 5/5""I'm Not Sorry"" 3/5""The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores"" 4/5""How Could Anybody Possibly Know How I Feel"" 4/5""First Of The Gang To Die"" 5/5""Let Me Kiss You"" 3/5""All The Lazy Dykes"" 3/5""I Like You"" 3/5""You Know I Couldn't Last"" 3/5Morrissey's long awaited album, You Are The Quarry, is for the most part a great album. There are some songs that could have been left off, namely ""I Like You"" and ""You Know I Couldn't Last."" Standouts include ""Irish Blood, English Heart"" and ""First Of The Gang To Die."" Definately worth checking out.Overall rating: Four stars."
2,Not worth the wait,I was very let down when I got this album... I expected much more than this from Morrissey. I have always been a huge fan of his work. I even pre-ordered this as soon as I heard it was going to be released. Irish Blood English Heart is the only catchy tune on the entire album. His anti-american lyrics really blow...who does he think buys most of his albums...???
4,America don't be so offended,"I'm sorry but this is not a 1 star out of five CD. Anyone that has put that is just plain wrong; so just ignore those reviews..... I can't belived the response of one of the Amazon reviewers. She decided to throw away the CD just because the 1st song (""America is Not the World"") pointed out some truths to America, that it's not so perfect. Why do some Americans get so offended by people being critical of it's country. IT IS NOT UNPATRIOTIC to be critical, if anything I belive it is patriotic, people like you give America a bad name....... Back to the CD, the stand out tracks to me were ""Irish Blood English Heart"", ""How can anybody know how I feel"", ...Crashing Bores"", but the best track by a long, long way is ""First of the Gange to Die"". This is class and definately one of his best solo singles ever. Ive found myself humming it here at work. Can't wait to see him perform live here this Summer!!!"
4,"Broadway, here he comes","The histrionic hero of the disaffected is back and more theatrical than ever. He keens, he coos, he plays to the last row. Morrissey has always thrived on controversy, so you get the expected America Is Not the World and Irish Blood, English Heart. But it's songs like I'm Not Sorry and The World Is Full of Crashing Bores that are closer to the core of the performer and possibly, the man. A lot of people have remarked on the rockingness of this release, but to me, he's a lot closer to Broadway here than the Lower East Side. You can almost imagine a glam musical made out of this material - campy, over the top and fun. It would have to star Morrissey himself, with his sweeping gestures and barbed asides. There's nothing wrong with being an interesting entertainer. At 45, it's a better option than aging rock star anyway. Could this be the birth of a Morrissey? Something like between Sinatra genetically spliced with Oscar Wilde?"
5,Getting better with age,"I accept that Morrissey may never again capture the feel of 1980's London, but does his voice not sound absolutely spectacular on his latest? And after looking at the album sleeve, has he never looked better? In a time when the music business is bombarded with gansta rap and mindless pop, a release such as ""You Are the Quarry"" is long overdue. The album revisits Morrissey's wit and cynicism in songs such as ""I Like You"" (""You're not right in the head/and nor am I/and this is why/this is why I like you"") and ""America is Not the World"" (""America/ it brought you the hamburger/ well America/ you know where you can shove your hamburger""). Notable tracks include the captivating ""Let Me Kiss You,"" the longing ""Come Back to Camden,"" ""The World is Full of Crashing Bores,"" and of course, the first single ""IBEH."" An absolute must for any Morrisey fan, or for anyone looking for something with some substance."
1,warning,This is the abbreviated version of You Are the Quarry. The full version has 21 songs and 4 videos. This has the first 10 songs and 1 video.
1,"More ""Viva Hate""","I tried and tried to hear what people liked about Morrissey? Johnny Marr and a line of many fine musicians made his sound. I gave a listen to ""You are the Quarry"" and found it more of the same - more whining with obvious subversive lyrics.While Morrissey knows how to write clever lines, this collection is too blasphemous (I Have Forgiven Jesus), anti-Protestant (Irish Blood, English Heart), and anti-American (America is Not the World) for another listen. Pity all he can produce is more ""Viva Hate"".There are better sounds to find."
2,We waited so long for this???,"The first song on this album is enough to make you vomit. What a pretentious little twit Morrissey has become. This album has three good songs on it, the rest are obvious filler. Where's Johnny Marr when you need him?"
1,boring insipid music,please stay far away from this talentless frontman of the smith's.this is a cheesy and boring album .avoid this at all costs.
1,not recommended,"i would not certainly not recommend this boring pop album from the vocalist of the lousy pop band smith's.let us hope that the five star reviewer girl on this page who keeps slamming the great pink floyd everyday in her meaningless,biased reviews everyday is banished to papua new guinea where she will not have access to a computer easily."
2,just aight,hard to believe it's been seven years since Morissey released an album&going by this set not much has changed from him.the songs on a whole are missing a bit more depth for me.the Bonus DVD helps this set out.
1,Mad.,"I am what I would consider a rather rabid liberal. I listened to the song 'America Is Not The World' hoping for a song tearing down the current American administrations foreign policy. What I got instead was a sickening generalization of all Americans. Are many Americans fat, stupid, and lazy ? Ofcourse ! Are we all as this song suggested ? Hell no. We in America have both the best and the worst humanity has to offer. He should have made some effort to aknowledge those of us who choose to be informed and humane."
2,Poor Comeback,"I have listened to it over and over and I am just not getting it. Right when the songs seem they are about to break into something glorious and morrissey-esque they suddenly end. Most of the songs are the length of typical punk rock songs, short! The music is bland and uninspiring and his attempt at becoming politically controversial are just sad. Morrissey was my fav through the 80's and early 90's but he has just lost what he had. The b-sides on the Irish Blood, English Heart single are better than any of the album tracks. The DVD is quite a waste as well, I mean one music video and some crap pictures, give me a break. Truly disappointed, good night and thank you."
3,Forgot He was even still around,"I guess when you have found new bands to move on to you forget time flies for other people. I hadn't even realized Morrissey hadn't released an new album in seven years. Well after a 7 year gap, this album is good simple as that. It isn't great beyond some of his other solo albums, and it isn't his worst. It is just a solid album, with the same sound he has had on previous outtings. Songs to me that stand out are First in the Gang to Die, I'm not Sorry, and Come back to Camden. In general this is worth buying if you are a fan of Morrissey, but don't except it to be the best thing he has done in his career, it is simply another step neither forward or backwards."
5,"Moz, You've Done It Again...",What more could possibly be said about this INCREDIBLE album? Simply Brillant...
5,sheila take a bow,"I had been long awaiting this album's release. I have to admit that when I first heard some of the songs I wasn't too impressed. But after a few listens it grew on me. It was definitely worth my money, great album from Morrissey. One of my favorites is the first track (as opposed to other reviewers). And then the singles are great too. So all in all, if you're an old-time Smiths/Morrissey fan then u should definitely get this. If you're not too hot for Morrissey then you probably wont like it."
5,"amazing, thanks morrissey!","first off, i am american. second, i love ""america is not the world"". morriseey loves america, he just sees the hypocrisy that exsist within america. morrissey has an uncanny way of singing what you never saw was present. i have had the cd in my car since it came out last tuesday and i think it will remain there for a long time. morrissey has never sounded better.if you have never heard morrissey, this is an excellent album to start with."
2,Disappointed,"This new Morrissey album is disappointing if you're an old school Mozzer fan. The lyrics are thought provoking, but way too obvious. Morrissey weighs in (as he usually does)on current world issues, while dealing with a few of his own as well. Morrissey has ditched his smooth, flowing lyrical writing style for a more direct, harsh approach. In come cases the lyrics just sound silly, as if he wrote them in a matter of minutes. For an artist that has been practically dormant for the last 7 years, and who hasn't had a seriously successful album in over 10, I can't help but be disappointed in this latest effort. Sorry, Moz, back to the proverbial drawing board......for another 7 years."
1,"he's not sorry, but those who've heard it are","Morrissey said it was going to have hooks. Does anyone hear them? His voice sounds better than ever. The songs on the other hand are horrible. Of the three rockers on the album ""irish blood english blood"", ""last of the gang to die"", and ""i like you"", none are deserving of being released as a single. and two of them are singles. The slow songs are even worse. ""all the lazy dykes"" is the worst well-sung song i have ever heard. This album has gotten major hype and lives up to none of it. There is nothing new lyrically. Morrissey nor his band couldn't find a melody if it bit them. avoid this album."
2,A Step Down,"Bottom line: love the Smiths, love Morrissey, but this one is a bit of a stinker. Very boring and I actually had to turn it off because it was getting on my nerves. Mozzer, you can do better."
3,Missing Person: Morrissey,"Anyone of you has seen Mr Stephen Morrissey? This guy singing songs like ""All The Lazy Dykes"" can't be the same person who wrote gems like ""There's A Light That Never Goes Out"", ""Heaven Knows I'm Misearable Now"", ""I Know It's Over"" or even ""The More You Ignore Me The Closer I Get"". For me, Morrissey is missing since 1994, by the release of Vauxhall And I. Albuns like Maladjusted or Southpaw Grammar are truly boring and I think that Stephen could do best than this MOR background arrangments that fill You Are The Quarry. But, don't burn the album yet. ""Come Back To Camdem"", ""The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores"" are good songs. But the biggest clue is on the last song: ""You Know I Couldn't Last"". He's absolutely right. I can almost imagine Mr Esteban eating T-Bones at the pool, listening to rap albuns under the California sun. Our foggy days are gone. And Morrissey is still missing."
4,Perfectly Back,"It's good to have Morrissey back. The album is good, he is good. It's not his masterpiece but it is wholesome and musically great. Some critics say the album is too ""Morrissey"" and he is still whining. Come on! What do you expect? Morrissey fans like Morrissey kind of albums. They dont expect a new sound or new lyrics or a brand new style. They dont expect him to change. Dont confuse us with Britney Spears fans. Welcome back, Moz. Keep whining, your fans will listen as always."
4,Great for all levels,"Awesome source for any details, includes info from names, how to, why, where, positions, background info and everything in between!"
5,easy enough for the beginner,I checked out this book from our local library and found that I have put post it notes on about half of the book. My husband had noticed the pages marked and had the idea to go online and find the book for me as a gift. He is now starting to venture into the quilt making world and is not affraid to enter a quilting store. The book arrived in new condition at my work site and what a surprise.....I would recommend this book to someone that might be having trouble with color options and the blank pattern pages are a great tool.
3,101 Nine Patch quilts,"I received it and the binding was coming apart, so I took it to a place to have it put in a spiral bound book form. Other wise it was ok. It was older and used."
3,DESK CALENDAR,"THIS IS A VERY NICE CALENDAR FOR THE COWBOYS FAN IT GIVES INSIGHT AND TRIVA FROM COWBOYS HISTORY AND ALSO FROM THE NFL..A ""MUST""FOR THE TRUE NFL FAN"
4,A delightful foodie frolic,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm a repressed foodie (with small kids, one doesn't get to actually experience a lot of great restaurants), and the meal descriptions were Ruth Reichl restaurant review worthy. It took a turn I didn't expect plotwise, with the UN business. Very clever and sometimes laugh out loud funny. I would definately look at this writer's next book."
4,Good Eating,"This was a delicious book and I would highly reccomend it. I have had three copies, one pan fried in olive oil with garlic (reccommended) and two oven roasted with a burgandy sauce (highly recommended)."
4,Overall... a good read,"Reinkarmation was recommended to me by a friend although I hadn't heard of the book. The opening chapters of the novel were well written and generated an interesting and confused protagonist. The plot moved along smoothly and the book is both easy and enjoyable to read. The themes of the book were numerous and perhaps slightly disconnected but gave the reader a variety of political and cultural topics to ruminate over. The major drawback of the novel was a handful of typos and occasionally stilted writing. On the other hand, certain sections are well written and very imaginative. The novel is interesting and overall worth reading."
5,Reinkarmation Review,"From the time I started reading the book (the first chapter especially is just riveting...), I was engrossed in the plot of the book. The author is able to hold one's attention by telling an intriguing story."
5,Take Two,"Repeating what I said in my review of the first volume: TNG was my second favorite Trek series, but only by a little to DS9. I don't recall how I came across the Nitpicker's Guides but I enjoy every one of them because they offer a deeper look into episodes, which causes you to notice things you didn't before, and this is coming from someone who considers himself quite observant. While many of the 'nits' mentioned may be just that, extremely nitpicky and easily rationalized, this book is not an official review and strictly for entertainment purposes by die-hard fans. Unfortunately due to legal reasons there will be no updated Guides, but the website started by author Phil Farrand (nitcentral) is still up and running if you're curious."
1,Wayward Widow,"This was like reading about a bratty 10 year old who needs attention. The first half of the book centers on all of Lady Julianna's misdeeds. After reading about all of these I found it hard to like her when she started to change. The hero, Martin, was even disgusted with her for the most part. All Julianna had to do was shed a tear and his opinion of her changed and he began to pursue her. I found it really hard to get attached to these characters. The writing was good so I will try another of Nicola Cornick's books."
1,A dull history of an interesting topic,"""News"" in the earliest American newspapers was primarily idea-oriented and political. By the Civil War, it was becoming more personal and sensational. By the end of the century, an entertainment factor was added to the equation. What should be an interesting and lively account of a fascinating subject, however, comes across as a mere textbook--dull and superficial. A disappointing book."
5,Superb live album,"The Living Legends claim that they're ""The best you never heard of"" - I have to agree. These guys are very talented lyricists and they have wicked beats. I think they're talented enough to have mainstream appeal, but I guess they don't want to sign on with a major label.This CD is a must have for any hip-hop fan. It's full of raw energy and unique rhymes."
3,Promising,"The music seems to be very promising, but not particularly striking. It's one of those CD's that you like for a while, and then forget that it's in your CD case."
2,Doesn't swivel the way I need it to,"I purchased these clamp on lights hoping I could use them at the top of my easel, to shine down on my painting but they won't swivel back towards the clamp. So, for me, for the intended purpose, they are useless. e.g. if you clamp at the top of a book case the light can't be swiveled back toward the bookcase to shine light in it.For other purposes, the clamps is very strong and opens quite wide. The part that does swivel is not smooth and I'm not sure about how it would wear. Of course, the metal shade gets very hot and you have to be very careful. The cord is short and to use it above waist high you'll need an extension cord."
3,The book is good but the shipping was way too high!!!,It seems like you can find great deals on Amazon and this book will get the creative juices flowing but I don't understand why you charge $4 for regular shipping when it is always about half that price on the received package?
4,Droon!,"Eric, Neal, and Julie find the hidden door in the basement. On the other side is a mystical land where they meet strange and unique creatures. How can they get back? Maybe the princess can help them."
5,Wonderful book for third graders!,I bought a class set of this book for my third grade class. They absolutely loved it and begged to be able to read it every day! They couldn't wait for the next books in the series to come out. It was easy to read and follow the adventure.
2,The Hidden Stairs and the Magic Carpet,"We are a group of fourth graders and we did not like the book called The Hidden Stairs and the Magic Carpet. Here are the reasons we disliked the book. The first reason is that it felt like a child wrote it. Another reason is that it was not exciting at all. On the cover it said The Hidden Stairs and the Magic Carpet, but it only talks about the magic carpet at the end of the chapter. We would recommend this book to a second grader because it had very short chapters and there were only five sentences on each page. They will like the characters too. These are the reasons we did not like this book."
4,Good for 5 - 9 year olds,"Eric, Julie, and Neal are best friends, so when Eric has to clean out the basement, everyone pitches in. While tossing around the junk, they unknowingly open a staircase to the magical world of Droon. The problem starts when they go down the staircase and can't get back to their world! Only by helping Droon to escape the evil plans of Lord Sparr can the three friends find their way home. This is a great story for young readers and a good book for parents to read out loud to younger children as well. It's interesting and creative enough that the adults won't fall asleep, but it won't give nightmares to the younger listener. I'd recommend for 5 to 9 year olds (depending on the child). Beyond that age, I don't think too many kids would find it `old' enough for them."
3,"Kids enjoyed it, but..","I bought this for my 7 yr old girl and 9 yr old boy -- They both stated they enjoyed it BUT my 9 yr old read it three times in less than an hour. Granted, I'm happy he wanted to read it, but I was looking for something more challenging for him to read over the summer. My 7 yr old also finished it in that same hour. So, I would recommend this for an earlier age, maybe 5 or 6 yr olds. As stated, my kids enjoyed it and it will probably be read more times, but now I hesitate to get the rest of the series considering it will only keep them occupied for so short a time."
4,Great for the early reader...dull for parents.,"My 7 year-old son really enjoyed this book, which we read together, which earns this book four stars right off the bat. Almost anything that gets kids to read is good if for no other reason than that!Three friends, Julie, Eric, and Neal, encounter a magic staircase while cleaning the basement of Eric's house. The stairs lead down to the fantastical world of Droon, where the three friends meet Keeah, a young princess. Together, the four kids evade the evil Lord Sparr and his minions of evil red men and flying lizards.I found the story line predictable, and the characters uninteresting. The creatures and their names seemed silly, rather than magical. Nevertheless, my son is excited to begin the next book in the series, so it's back to Droon we'll go!"
3,Interesting Premise for a young childrens series,"For all the hype I heard on this series I was a bit disappointed. The book is a second grade reading level (give or take depending on the child) with a kindergarten story line. It focuses on 3 children who are suppose to be cleaning out a basement and learn that the closet under the stairs is a gateway to another world, called Droon. They enter Droon, save a princess and go home. End of story.The overall concept for this series seemed to have potential but I feel the author could have done a better job and added more to it for the older children to actually challenge them a bit, or shortened it and kept it a younger children's book. Just my opinion, mind you. Still, even if its basic and short still a fun read."
1,reads like bad kids' TV,"Someone else go these books for my kids, and I got rid of them as soon as I could. They read like the most unimaginative children's TV. Action is punctuated with sound effects -- ""Zap!"" ""Whoosh!"" etc. Characters are constantly exclaiming ""Cool!"" and ""Awesome!"" -- I got so sick of this when reading out loud, I started substituting ""Amazing!"" and other words, but it didn't help much, because the rest of the writing is equally uninspired. Lessons to be learned are condescendingly spelled out -- stuff like ""Hey! We can win if we all work together!"" Plots are a mishmash of fantasy elements borrowed from actual children's literature -- save your money and time and get the real thing instead."
1,A kid review - Age 8,"This book was boring, babyish, and just plain dumb. The kids in the story were really fake and the plot was just silly. I wish my mom had never made me read it. Want to read a good book try anything by Roald Dahl. Patrick"
1,Don't waste your money,"Unfortunately, I purchased this camera 1 day before the 1st review, so I did so without any insight. But, given the fact I was buying it for a 10yr old, I didn't really need much and wanted to keep cost to a minimum so I took a chance. Well, I have to say both previous reviews now seem generous. After using the camera for one day (Xmas day), and listening to my 10 yr old complain about how bad it was, I returned it to Amazon. It is an absolutely horrible product, not worth $4 let alone $40. I even tried a tri-pod and pictures still came out blurry. I have since purchased a new low cost camera for about $60 - it is considerably better than this one - pictures are clear and shutter speed is much faster....and my daughter is happy with it. So spend a few extra dollars and avoid this product."
2,Did it come from a cereal box?,"The pictures you can take with this camera would have been considered ""ok"" at the advent of digital photography, but nowadays they're really low quality compared to anything I've seen... almost like webcam stills, only larger. The viewscreen is almost completely worthless. The buttons are basic at best, and the actual construction of the whole product is very cheap and light... I almost thought it was a toy after taking it out of the packaging.If you are at all used to a $100+ digital camera, you'll be disappointed with this. If you know absolutely nothing about digital cameras and just want to try one, this may be OK. At least you'll know almost everything else out there is better.I agree with northeasternsales' review below as far as technical aspects of this cam."
4,Great Kids Camera,"I purchased a camera for my 10 year old grandson. My family are camera buffs and at first they thought it wasn't good enough for him. However, after a bit of time, everyone agrees that this is a really good camera for my grandson. Nancy"
3,Por el precio esta bien,"La compre para mi hija de 8 años. Las fotos que sacan no son maravillosas. Pero se pueden bajar directo a la computadora. Considero que son mejor opcion que las de Disney, etc. que venden para niños.Algunos problemas que presenta son: si se le quiere ampliar la memoria se le puede colocar una tarjeta SD hasta de 512 MB, que casi no se consiguen; trabajan con pilas AAA y ya sabemos que eso puede ser latoso; la pantalla es bastante pequeña y no se ve muy bien.Aun asi, por 14 $ y para evitar que mi hija quiera usar la mia (mucho mas cara), arriesgandola, esta bien"
2,Could be fun,"Others have noted a too small veiwing screen and its a bit blurry. Not sure it actually has all the functionality claimed, haven't been able to get that far with it. But it might end up being fun in the end as kind of a novelty item. Doesn't make a great gift for a younger child, however."
1,A monumental waste of money,"The quality is so poor, you cannot see any details. Don't worry about whether somebody blinked - you cannot even see if they have eyes or a mouth; it's just a blur. My 8 year old doesn't even want to play with it as a toy, and I'd bought it for him."
3,OK for toy camera,"It was a gift for my 5 year old daughter, and that is about all it is good for. Pictures sometimes turn out pretty good, but you can't tell by the viewer. She has had it now over a year, and it still works."
1,unsatisfied,My daughter opened this product on Christmas morning and it refused to work right out of the box. My husband tried different batteries and messed with it for hours and could never get it to work.
3,Great for a 9yr old,"This camera if perfect for my 9yr olds first digital camera. He has really enjoyed taking pictures and video. One side note, make sure to order a memory card to go with it. Great little camera for a kid."
2,Camera,"I bought this camera for a gift, it looks nice but when I got it is very light and plastic more along the cheep toy feel. The camera takes descant pictures so I'm not too upset but If I had looked at it in the store I would not have purchased it."
4,Works so far,"I thought this was going to be a waste of $5. It didn't work at all after I installed it on our HP C3140. Then I looked a little closer at the ink cartridge. When I removed the protective strip from the cartridge, not all of it came off. OOPS! There was still some covering the electrical contacts, and it was completely covering the ink nozzle. After I removed the rest of the strip, it seems to work fine. We will see how long it lasts. But for 1/3 to 1/5 of the price of an OEM cartridge, it can have a significantly shorter lifespan and I will still come out ahead. I wish it came with an envelope to return my depleted cartridge. I only rated 4 stars because of unknown lifespan and no way to return old cartridge.12/17/11 Update:We have recently done some photo printing and this cartridge performed great."
1,This Bus is rubbish!,"Bratz suck, anyway. Barbie's TOTALLY rule! This bus keeps on falling apart and the little pieces are useless. Remember this is no good and think before you buy."
5,GRooVY baBY,MAN DOES DIS TOY RULE!IT HAS EVERYTHING THE BRATZ NEED.THAT WHY I USE IT AS THEIR ROAD TRAVEL BUS.I JUST WISH THE CAR WAS A TAD BIGGER.ANYWHO DA BRATZ RULE!STAY TRUE DIVAS AND I AM THE BRATZ NUMBAH ONE TRU FAN!!!GO BRATZ!!
5,this is great,ok first of all ur meant to be putting batteries inside the car!2nd of all this car is fantastic and u can also buy a red version of it!i have had it for 2 years and its amazing!i got it for my birthday.oh ya and nothing has happened to it so far.tata~motahra!
5,WoW!!!CoOoOoOoL!!!,"Awsome!! I LOVE the Bratz collection and yeah i hope to get this AWSOME bus for Christmas! I also recomend the ski lodge for the regular sized Brtaz (NOT the lil' ones) They're cool and i'm asking for Dana, Jade and Yasmin in the wintertime wonderland collection and yeah, yeah i luv Bratz they're the numba one girls!!! Lol!"
2,This is an ok toy,My daughter doesnt enjoy this bus as much as I thought she would have based on all of its other reviews. We did find that the top is difficult to put on for a 5 year old and would have prefered that the chairs were stationary so everything didnt fall all over the place with the bus is in motion. The radio is neat though.
5,Smoothie Bar??,"Why is it called a smoothy bar? Oh well, the toy is still fun and great to play with. And it can also be used for a Barbie bus if you don't like Bratz. It is very cool and neat for kids ages 8-14. It is very very sweet and i recomend it."
2,Buddy Holly overdubs,"The fantastic music of Buddy Holly has been tampered with on this cd. All of the songs should have been left alone. The Picks invade and ruin the originality of these recordings and I strongly suggest ""not"" adding this cd to your collection. We Buddy Holly fans deserve better than this."
1,The aural equivelent of grave robbing...,"In the early 60's, Coral Records made an attempt to ""modernize"" Buddy Holly's classic hits. These hits (and a few rough demos) were buried beneath tons overdubbed guitar and drums (The Picks. Who I'm sure Buddy had never heard. Lucky him.) Each song is also layered with intrusive backing vocals. (Do we really need a chorus of souless ""ooh-ing and ahh-ing"" during ""Peggy Sue""? Yikes.) Try to avoid your morbid curiosity. Pass this one up. Stick with the original versions."
1,Disappointing and Incomplete,"I though I would see more troubleshooting solutions on "".. Has Performed an Illigal Operation.."" and Fatal exceptions errors. I am having numerous difficulties with a Windows 98 installation and though the book would help me more than it did."
1,I Wish I'd Passed On This One..,"Well I read this book cover to cover and I upset that this book doesn't help with any problems that I needed help with. I then tried their websites that they said to use and those sites are not around anymore. This book was written by the Microsoft Press and unfortunately just like other M$ books they have a catchy title, but little inside. Oh well now I must continue my search for my computer problems."
5,Old Mystery...,"A Crime Club Selection...It all began when a best selling American author, living in Paris was forced by a mountain of unpaid bills to recognize the fact he could no longer maintain the sybaritic way he enjoyed. He cast about for a solution and found that murder seemed the only alternative. Had it not been for some entailed jewelry belonging to his stepson, a belted earl, the writer would probably have gotten away with it. But his disappearance, coinciding with that of a ruby necklace, roused the interest of Sym Gilkerson, a security management adviser (private eye). With the collaboration of an attractive social anthropologist, Sym traces the missing author to Haiti, where he finds that Nemesis has already started doing her stuff."
5,German funksters do right by the funk,"Looking at these guys and hearing them you would never geuss that they are white and they are German. At first listen the lead singer sounds like he is Black. However, with his long straight hair He looks more like Axl Rose than James Brown. The Musicianship is very good. My Friend from Germany gave me this cd because I am into Funk Music. I like it a lot. It does bring the Funk."
5,It is a great SMALL wallet for the front pocket,"I have had the view slimmy for almost two years and have adopted to it fairly well. I do like carrying a wallet in my front pocket and I like that the slimmy philosophy of carrying only what you truly need, helping me to reduce what I carry. I carry my drivers license, health insurance card, one blank check, two business cards, two credit cards and usually 5 to 7 bills. It will take a little while for the wallet to open up a little bit and then everything works fairly well.Postives: Small, well built, id visible, holds all I need, front pocket wallet.Negatives: Price, reaching for the wallet while seated is more difficult in the front pocket, and you will be surprise how much this happens; especially in the car. The id doesn't completely show but most clerks are ok with it."
5,It's ok,It's slim and I don't know how long it will last over time from normal wear and tear. It holds my necessities. Just what I was looking for. Could be a little cheaper. Id compartment isn't difficult to get in and out of either.
1,Junk!!!,It has an ID window that does not have a slot to insert your ID. Somebody probably it would be funny to sew it shut. It wasn't worth my time and effort to return it. Went right into the trash can.
3,Need a Middle Ground,"I think there are more possibilities regarding the fossil record, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the principles of evolutionary theory than are represented in the reviews of this book. I would not be comfortable presenting this book to my children as absolute truth any more than I am comfortable teaching them that the principles of evolutionary theory are all absolute truth. We don't know exactly HOW God made the Earth, only WHY...which is the aspect presented in the scriptures. I'd like to see a book about dinosaurs and the fossil record for children that does not rest solely on either side of this...one which offers openly all, or at least many of the possibilities, helps children see the whole scope of what information is available, and helps them work it out for themselves."
1,"Wow, what a joke.","This is clearly Gish's most outragous book. I'm amazed that anyone believes a word in it, but there seems to be a lot. Parents, the poor children who you are forcefeeding these disturbing lies are going to have a hell of a time adjusting to reality later. If you plan to send you child to college some day DO NOT allow this man's perverse ideas into their mind, it will either cause them to be ridiculed at school by their peers, or more likely they'll learn the truth and it will backfire on you, the parent! Ignoring modern advances in this feild, Gish uses outdated evidence from over 100 years ago to support this fairytale view of the fossil record. How could anyone really think dinosaurs lived 6,000 years ago? He is a nut, simple as that."
1,"Educational, for some.","This book is a fantastic example of how facts and science can be manipulated, misrepresented and plain made up to display anything an author desires. Excellent for teaching children about bias and lies, and for imbuing them with a healthy amount of scepticism. Not so great for learning anything factual though."
1,I was really hoping this was a joke....,"This is a book written by people who have either a great sense of humor or a negative understanding of science or facts and clearly no knowledge of dinosaurs. My six year old threw his hands in the air and declared it ""stupid"" when he saw a picture of a dinosaur breathing fire, yes that's right apparently dinosaurs breathed fire!! who knew?"
1,Dinosaurs on the Ark?,"Let's get real. If Noah had been asked to include dinosaurs on the ark, wouldn't that have been worth mentioning in the bible? This is feel good drivel for creationists."
5,Sushi Lounge,"I haven't brought the Sushi Lounge, and me and my daughter is Avid lovers of the Bratz Dolls. Please! tell me where I can get it and please don't stop making it."
4,Cute little lounge!,"I just got this a day ago and it is so fun! The black part revolves- just like a real sushi lounge! You should definetly get this toy, it is fun and it is definetly worth the price!"
5,Bratz just wanna have fun!,"Before the Bratz go-go to the disco, the girls with a passion for fashion and the Boyz who love them are sure to stop by their favorite city eatery, the Tokyo-A Go-Go Sushi Lounge, for an international helping of exotic food and superstylin' atmosphere. With over 40 funky pieces, including a karoke stage and mic stand, this set is sure to keep them comin' back for seconds! By the way this isn't educational!"
3,Interesting but not inspiring,"Perhaps I ask too much of this book, but it read a bit too much like a young adult story - simplistic and lacking in depth. On the other hand, it can be difficult to write from the point of view of a child and keep an adult audience."
2,Same as owner manual,If you have the owners manual then you don't need this DVD. It didn't give any insite on what you are looking at or any clarity on how to use it better. A waste of money
2,Couldn't get past the first chapter,"I really can't rate the entire novel, because I couldn't get past the first few pages. The entire first chapter was so unrealistic, the hero's reaction to a girl he'd never seen and knew nothing about so contrived, that I couldn't bear to proceed. It was as if I knew the entire, predictable story. I'm an avid reader of romance, and I've read 'em all. I won't waste my time if the story doesn't grab me right away and make me care about the characters and their situations."
2,Don't Bother,"This is the eight Bill Slider mystery that I have read. I have enjoyed all previous seven books, but this one I found utterly confusing and worse, utterly boring. I found myself not only starting to skim the pages, but actually flipping pages. There were too many characters to keep track of, let alone care about. Harrod-Eagles fared better with her series characters: Slider, Joanna, Atherton, and Sue. They had some relationship issues that were interesting, but since this is a mystery book, I would expect the mystery part to be better than the relationship part.Only die hard Slider fans should read this one."
3,Unsatisfying and rushed ending mars this inferior entry,"Although not a complete washout, a disjointed narrative and an unsatisfying ending makes this one of the weakest entries in the DI Bill Slider series. Ironically, Slider and his fellow officers are often lamenting the lack of hard evidence to assist their inquiries. Perhaps Harrod-Eagles is telling us that she didn't adequately plot the story. In any event this entry may indicate that this series has run its course and that the author is ready to move on to a new police procedural. Unless you have read all previous entries in this series, I strongly recommend that you not waste your time on this inferior entry."
3,This is a Weak Book in the Series!,"I love Ms. Harrod-Eagles' Bill Slider. He is one of my favourite Police Detectives out there right now. He's smart, funny and has a droll sense of humour, and he's a genuinely nice guy. But I was disappointed with this book. It was somewhat disjointed and had a loose plot. The reader figures out who the bad guy is practically right away and it's a matter of reading to find out how they manage to get him. And even there we are thwarted because the ending is rushed and we don't actually get the satisfaction of seeing the bad guy nailed with the evidence. Ms. Harrod-Eagles' dry wit and her puns are still excellent though, and I will continue to read this series."
3,Hard to read the temperature,"I bought this to keep track of my fish water, but the red lie is so hard to see and accurately assign the temperature. I would look for another brand."
4,Nice little thermometer,"Great thermometer for the price, easy to mount and easy to read. Also, it has the optimum temperature band for fish highlighted, which precludes having to read the tiny numbers."
2,Very very hard to read what temp its at,"it has a green area where fish are supposed to be in, but to actually figure out what temperature its at is very difficult, because of how the temperature are placed in regards to the lines. I just came on amazon to order a different one since I am not happy at all with this one."
1,Damaged product broken upon arrival,"I bought this product as a birthday gift, and it arrived on my nephew's birthday, nut the product was completely smashed within the packaging!"
1,Broke after 2 months,I had this thermometer stuck in the corner of my tank behind a plant. It came apart on its own - the thermometer innards slid out from the glass tube that contained them.This thermometer was in use for two months. Very disappointed. It's cheap but I expected about a year out of it. Luckily it was cheap so this isn't a major loss.Not recommended.
1,Doesn't work -- my aquarium isn't <40F!,"I bought one of these to verify that my other thermometer is correct and to check water temps when changing aquarium water. Unfortunately, the indicator doesn't even reach the bottom level. My aquarium is ~72F, and this thermometer reads more like 35F. Completely useless, and too cheap to be worth the hassle and shipping to return it."
2,It might have been great....,"I bought this along with a digital aquarium thermometer for my bettas 2.5 gal glass aquarium. I purchased it from Amazon.com, it arrived fine, I put it in the tank- and it WAS NOT well received. My betta, Rojo, is a red betta fish. The bottom of this thermometer is also a big hunk of red, and he most definitely felt threatened by it- flaring his gills and fins. I wanted to leave it in there for a few minutes to see if he would calm down and to see if it would read the correct temperature. Well, my betta was getting more and more stressed and to my recollection- the red line in the thermometer didn't even budge. I'm not saying that this is a horrible product- but I certainly couldn't use it and it was most definitely a waste of money for me. All fish have personalities and mine happens to have a super aggressive one. Having said all that- I gave it 2 stars because I'm pretty sure mine was also defective."
4,Too small for this old eyes,Should be good if you are young enough to read it.I would prefer those stick on thermometer.Just not for me. But still good.
1,Spent a few more bucks and get something that works,The thermometer readings were not so accurate. After leaving the thermometer in the tank for a few days I noticed that the bottom was broken. Now I have no idea what the thermometer leaked into the tank.
3,Very Very Small,I was shocked when I saw how small this thing is. If you have anything but good vision it may not be the best choice for you.
1,Product arrived shattered,"The thermometer is made of very thin glass, and a bubble mailer isn't sufficient packaging for such a product. Nevertheless, that's what it arrived in. The thermometer was completely shattered, beyond use or repair. I'm returning it and purchasing theFluval Nano Thermometerbecause it's much thicker glass and I've never had a problem with those in the three that I've bought."
5,Just right..........................,What can I say.. A thermometer is a thermometer. It works just great. Can not add anything else to say........
3,Stopped Working,Fantastic for a week or so but then it spazzed and got stuck on 75 degrees or so but what do you expect for 3 bucks anyway?
5,Simple. reliable tool...,So far so good with these thermometers. I use three now and all work well. Easy to read most of the time.
1,Shattered. Cut my finger.,"I found this thermometer to not be very accurate after using it for 3-4 months. Today, it shattered as I was picking it up. I did not apply unnecessary pressure or grip; I simply lifted it from the tank and the glass shattered. I cut my finger in the process. Too fragil and terribly inaccurate."
3,A bit let down,"When I got this, I was happy that I could keep an eye on my Betta fish's water's temperature. It does that flawlessly. My only problem, is that you should NOT get this if you have a plastic tank/bowl. I am still using a starter tank, which is plastic. When I first put it in that tank, it stuck to the side and stayed there without any problem. Then I decided to clean the tank thoroughly and removed the thermometer from the side of the small tank. It left a a mark, as though the rubber was eating away at the plastic. I then tried to put the thermometer back and after staying suctioned to the tank for a minute or so, it kept felling away from the tank wall. I don't remember reading anything about it not being good for a plastic tank/bowl. Maybe I missed something. Other thank that, it's a thermometer, so it does what it's supposed to. I just no longer sticks to the walls."
5,Works great,Way better and cheaper than the stupid little strip you can put on your tank. I couldn't even tell what the temp was but I got this for like a buck fifty and it works great. My fish or turtle haven't knocked it off and I now know my temp at all times without any struggle
1,unreadable,"The only way to read this thermo is with a bright light. The liquid that shows temp is light orange, rather than dark red like every other thermo I've use. I threw it out after 2 days."
4,"Does it's job, but the suction cup eventually wears out","This thermometer is easy to read, floats in the tank, and appears to accurately tell the temperature. The issues that I have had with it are: 1) it is glass, and my turtles have actually bitten the thermometer causing it to shatter inside the tank. This left little glass shards in the water. I imagine this wouldn't be a problem if you just have fish. 2) The suction cup eventually wore out and stopped holding the thermometer to the tank. Now it floats around and I can't read it without taking it out of the water."
1,Came Broken!,I had gotten another therm. from a local store before this came to me. Im glad I did b/c it came broken!
1,Extremely Breakable,"I bought two of these for my betta tanks. Although I felt the readings were accurate, while changing the water in one of the tanks, the thermometer shattered and sent the liquid and all of the tiny black balls everywhere. It made a mess and has made me wary about using the second. Hopefully they'll make the glass a little stronger/thicker in the future."
3,You better have good eyes,"The unit attached firmly to the inside of the aquarium using the included suction cup. The numbers on the thermometer are very small and are difficult to read. However, there is a broad green stripe on the thermometer which covers the ""typical"" temperature range for fresh water tropical fish, so it is usable. It is just very difficult to know if the temperature is 76 or 78 or 80, since the numbers are very small. If you need a low cost thermometer, this may meet your needs, but you better have very good eye sight if you plan to ready the numbers."
2,Difficult to Read,"I bought two of these. The temperature scale is quite small. The background for the ""Safe Zone"", from 70-80 degrees, is dark green, the scale is very small, and the bead in the thermometer is very small. This all makes reading the temperature quite difficult.I have not had this problem with different-brand thermometers, and will be purchasing replacements for these."
3,Works well but fragile,"I bought this in February and it broke in May. I was trying to remove the suction cup bit to clean the thermometer (the suction cup is detachable). The top of the plastic (or maybe it's just thin glass) tube popped right off.It looks nice, it's not too big and wont block the view of whats in your tank, and it's accurate as far as I could tell. Just be really careful when you try to clean it (you might be better of leaving the suction cup attached or maybe even just cleaning it while it's still in the tank)."
1,"Numbers are too small, did not work for my nursery","The suction cup works well to hold the thermometer to the side, but the numbers are so small they are hard to read. It is also hard to see the red mercury line because it is extremely thin, so have to get a flashlight to see if the temp which is not convenient. I needed one for my nursery tank; it is important to keep a steady temp for the fry. I have since bought a different thermometer from a local super store that is much easier to read (and cost less to boot.)"
3,mostly good,"those who like beautiful and symphonic progressive music with a little touch of celtic influence will like this dvd. It represents the best of this band so far... Nothing spectacular to see, but enjoyable for the ears. The singer's voice reminds a lot of the camels'one at times. The best songs are those who contains longs developpements in a pure prog tradition. The sound and picture are good for a 2002 DVD."
3,Declination is not adjustable,"The declination on this compass is not truly adjustable. The red, north box/arrow always points to true north. To adjust for magnetic declination, you have to make sure the north end of the needle is offset from red north box/arrow by the number of degrees that your area's magnetic field differs from true north.This is a bit more error prone and is a lot less convenient than being able to adjust the north box/arrow for your declination once and then just align the needle with the box/arrow whenever you take a sighting. The Silva Ranger lets you adjust the box/arrow for declination like this, I'd spend a bit extra and get the Ranger if you plan to do any real back country navigation.Other than the lack of adjustable declination, this is a good compass. It's sturdy, has a see-through base, and has a good mirror and markings to get a true sighting."
2,ouch!,"This compass will probably function with no problems. Watch out for the mirror though! On the one I purchased, the hinge is so tight that it is difficult to open and close--and it's easy to accidentally pinch your finger between the mirror and the compass base when it pops all the way open. I know it sounds like a minor complaint, but it hurts! I MUCH prefer the comparable Brunton that I just purchased--it seems like it's higher quality and a better design."
3,The Sword stained with Royal Blood,This movie is ok...considering Yuen Biao is the star. At times when the film becomes interesting it becomes choppy because somebody did a real bad editing job. The film is not that bad except you can definitely see the actors strapped to the wires in some of the action scenes. This movie left me really dissapointed in the producer and director for not getting a better editor.
2,Does Not Age Well,"There's really not much to say about this book and I can do this without spoilers.The book is 405 pages and it's an anthology. Some of the stories are just okay but some are total stink-bombs that I could not finish and was forced to skip over them because the story was just so boring or the writing was just so bad that it was uninteresting and couldn't hold my attention.Also several of these stories appear in other White Wolf publications so a few times I found I was re-reading stories that I had already read before.It's not a horrible book, but it's not great and it's just under the bar of what I consider ""okay"" in the literary world.Two stars is the best I can give this book."
3,"Good, but not what I need","While I enjoyed watching ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" the plot moved slowly and left out some crucial parts. There is a focus on the homo-erotic side of the story, especially in the scene with Alan Campbell. I have been trying to get my students to see the text from both a straight and a homosexual viewpoint, and to discuss why Wilde did not state the reason Gray is able to blackmail Campbell. This version is therefore too black-and-white to fit into classroom discussions about seeing art from multiple perspectives. For high school students in a conservative part of the country, the 1945 movie version is probably the better (safer) version to play."
2,unforgivably dull,"I am a fan of Oscar Wilde and of BBC productions, but to make Wilde's plays and stories boring takes either special effort, or decided lack of effort. I've bought this dvd but it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.The stagy and low-budget sets are to be expected from older BBC tv productions; the costumes are very nice. Sound and picture qualities are excellent. The actors are mostly very good especiallySusan Hampshire and Jeremy Brett in ""Ideal Husband"", who each provide provide sorely-needed beauty,youth, and especially, energy. (The overaged Mrs Cheavely acts well, but is miscast). But the pacing and direction of each production is so dull, that I found myself just wanting these to end quickly. The ""Earnest"" is so slow and boring as to be the most unwatchable of the group, and that should be a criminal offense."
4,Fullmetal Alchemist Vol 8,The story is beyond intriguing! The homonculi reveal their dastardly plans. Scar is on the move again. The Elrics are still searching for a stone. But who is Dante and how is she connected to Ed and Al's father? Why is Izumi so protective of that strange boy? And why is he so obsessed with Ed? Find out in the continuing saga of the Fullmetal Alchemist!
1,Didn't work at all!,"Mine also did not work, obviously not worth purchasing, and I'd boycott the Seller as well. Doesn't look like I'll be getting any kind of refund."
2,yet to arrive,"i don't yet know if this charger will fit, as i have yet to receive it. it's always a toss up when one needs a new charger for an old phone. even if the model numbers match, the plug may not fit properly. the phone manufacturer does not keep stock in old parts, so as to encourage the purchase new a new phone. that said, this is a generous 2 stars, as i have no idea when i will receive this order. here's the deal............if someone goes to the trouble to research and order a charger for an older phone, i would think that implies that they NEED IT NOW! $1.27 order with a ship cost of $5.96 for less than one oz. weight.......suggests that this could have been sent faster than the suggested 7-10 days for snail mail from coast to coast."
3,Not like i wished...,It didnt work... it was cheap. Worked maybe 40% of the time. other time it wouldn't charge anything
2,It's just so bad!,"This game is a classic case where the game developer released something to merely cash in on the popularity of the Puffy/Ami/Yumi franchise. The game is entirely a side-scrolling fighter (except for the occasional forgetful mini-games)and you'll fight 3 or 4 of the same enemies over and over again on a level, then it's off to the next level to fight the next 3 or 4 new enemies over and over AND OVER. I was prayiing that each level would end before it ever began. This is just too bad because the sound samples and amount of unlockable content made me want to keep playing; sadly the repetitive gameplay overshadows anything positive the game can offer. Don't buy this for yourself and don't you dare buy it for your children -no matter how much they beg you, because if you do, they will grow up hating you for it!"
1,Ugh..,"I'm only wasting my time doing this because all the other reviews are good and I think some unsuspecting soul like myself might be FOOLED into wasting five bucks on a book not worth 2 cents. Seriously, I'm in high school and I found the writing quality poor. The main character, I am sorry, but he is so cheesy, part of the vampire mystic is lost when the loser doesn't even know how to operate a car window. The beginning was boring, the very ending was HORRIBLY cheesy...the only part that started to interest me was the Desiree character, but she's not anything too special either. And I just hated the whole 'the Hunger' thing, so cheesy. And I like vampire novels, so don't think I'm criticizing this one because it's about a vampire, I'm criticizing it because it's a BAD book about a boring and pretty much cliche (Ohhh, he's sensitive and into the arts! Oh he likes poetry! I can't help but swoon..)vampire."
3,Some problems,"Unable to figure out how to use the lanyard - eventually adapted to a lanyard I already had. Some instructions/directions would have been nice.Otherwise, totally satisfied with the product."
5,Raw and Beautiful,"This is the demo for Coup d'Etat, and it's absolutely insane. The same songs but performed with an energy level that is practically live, with all the raw passion that made Wendy O Williams so infatuating. ""Put Your Love In Me"" is so tough it's almost frightening. It's incredible that she was performing this at the time AC/DC was playing ""Let Me Put My Love Into You"" (which was getting incredible radio play), and yet Wendy was black-listed, arrested and beat up. She really scared people. I don't think she ever got the credit she deserved for the passion and the force of her social statements.If you like your music a little cleaner, get Coup D'Etat (which is also great), but if you want to hear a little more of the intensity that made Wendy O. Williams irreplaceable and without peer, try this."
5,"Great Story, Worth Reading Many Time","I must come back to this book in about 2 months and read it again. The story is new yet old, told with the talent of a master story teller. Very hard to put down, had to read the text at one sitting. Good twists on the nuclear doomsday theme. Great Job!"
2,Cheesy and sloppy,"This book was given many good reviews, so I bought it. I am not sure why now that I have read this book. The story jumps quickly from theme to theme without spending the time to really elaborate or make you care about any of the themes or characters. We go from radiation poisoning to child molestation to giant killer cockroaches without blinking an eye. Dumb story, okay writing."
4,I enjoyed reading it twice.,"This book is a crossover between SF/Fantasy and Romance. The heroine, from a near future earth, is sucked into another dimension. You follow her trials and tribulations as she tries to understand what has happened to her and how the ""magic"" in this new world works. (Sorry, any more detail and I'll spoil the mysteries.) The book engrossed me enough that I enjoyed re-reading it. If you enjoy romance, spiced with action, you'll enjoy this book."
5,"Mike LeDonne-Smokin"" out loud",Great Souljazz Hammond B3 Organ date with Eric Alexander Playing tasty bebop derived solos as does Mike on the Organ.Standards and organ hits are the fare.Its Acid Jazz because it has the soulfunk sound of the B3 Masters by a Master yet the solos are jazzy bebop done in a most soulful way.Both sax & Organ are strong my advice is if this is the case buy it because its rare. David Smith
2,Another pianist who can't play organ.,"I'm not really sure why this album is getting all the attention that it is. Yeah, these guys can play a lot of notes. Big deal. The album centers around Mike Ledonne, the organist- what so many people fail to realize is that the organ is totally its own instrument. Yeah, it has keys, but that's about where similarities to the piano end.It also bothers me that some of the saxophone solos are *clearly* overdubbed. Come on guys, this is JAZZ.Bottom line is that Mike Ledonne sounds like a pianist trying to play organ. Boo-urns. Pick up a Gene Ludwig album."
1,Sorry I Replaced Version 2 (1995),"Family Tree Maker Version 16 Collector's EditionI found this version almost 12 years later than my original, to be of almost no value. The displays, moving between screens, and reports are either the same or not as good. The searching of the web sites is of benefit, but the reporting techniques do not follow the parameters of the search. For example, if I wanted ONLY death references I get everything. I then have to wade through all the unwanted references. You can not even SORT by, say, the source type: Death, Birth, Marriage. I can not understand the superhype about this system and it not having basic search capabilities like a grown up program!If you do not own any Tree program then this is worth it. You should take a look at My Heritage Family Tree for comparison."
2,Family Tree needs to suply magnifying glass,The manual provided is a full print version which is commendable in todays software climate where nothing can normaly seen in print without a screen. However the Type chosen is so small that anyome with normal vision cannot possibly folow the text without a magniying glass. Definitely tis version of a great softeare is not designed for mere mortals especially if they are ageing
4,Family Tree Maker Version 16,"I have been using the Family Tree Maker products for a number of years. I love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts. I am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder. I feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly, both visually and functionally."
3,Family Tree Maker version 16 Collectors Edition,"I was familiar with the way that the Family Tree Maker works because I have owned several older versions with version 10 being the most current. I was satisfied with the actual charts, but the writing in the books is so small that I needed a magnifier to read much of it and the illustrations were completely useless because they were illegible."
3,Wish they has for the Mac,"It is a great program, but I wish they had a version for the Mac. Luckily I have a MacBook Pro. I had to buy Window XP so that I could use Family Tree Marker. I have been using a Mac version of FTM for many years and was upset that they did not support the Mac any more. Maybe they will wake up and do a version for us Mac users."
4,Familty Tree Maker software,This software has a lot of features. It will be very helpful to get all of my family history organized.
5,Takamine eg341c great out of the box,"Ordered the Takamine eg341c acoustic electric guitar from brook mays, and it arrived super quick and double boxed in excellent condition. There are varying descriptions of this guitar on the internet. Type in eg341c into a search engine and you'll get pictures of all sorts of takamine guitars. The guitar is glossy black with white trim, the tuners are pearl white with gold buttons. It has a TP4T built in pickup with tuner(convenient), which works great. The guitar plays great right out of the box, no need for a pro setup. There is no buzzing on any string on any fret(tried them all). The guitar is good and loud, and sounds great. Easy to play, almost as easy as an electric; easier in some respects. Great looking guitar too!"
2,"It May Work in a Game, But Not in a Book","Translated from the original German, it is difficult to assign blame for bad writing. This is based on Germany's best-selling game Realms of Arkania.A strange story of a magic-assisted plot but where no one suspects magic of being used to ill purposes. There is a tendency to skip scenes sort of like in Monty Pythons' The Cycling Tour where the pair escape a charge of bayonets somehow during a missing scene. It also seemed odd that the characters never once thought of not drawing attention to themselves why they we being hunted down by every guardsman in the land."
2,Prefer Victorinox Granton Edge Santoku Knife,This is not a bad knife set but we prefer the Victorinox 47529 Fibrox 7-Inch Granton Edge Santoku Knife- the Fibrox handle feels better and the inner corner of the Victorinox knife blade (the heel/ finger guard) curves away from the handle rather than towards it. My mother cut her thumb on this and it often pokes my hand uncomfortably.
3,Not the best,"Ok, so I have an 'eclectic' collection of knives. I bought these because the price and name was right. The larger one is ok...not as sharp as I expected, but sharpened up with a bit of elbow grease. The smaller one has a defective blade, with a point that is not formed properly. For the price, it is not worth the effort to send them back at the price point I bought them for, but be aware that these Henckels may not be of the quality you might expect from the name."
3,Nice knives,"These aren't the same quality as my Pro S knives, but for the money they can't be beat. There have been times in my life that I wish I hade a knife as good as these are. Time will tell how they stand up to use."
4,great knives,"These knives are great... soooo sharp and just the right shape for chopping, etc. Very pleased with this purchase."
5,excellent,"I adore good knives. I got more that I expected. well balanced, match my other ja hencles. LOVE LoVE them! would recommend seller, too!"
2,"It gives me the ""Chopping Blues""...........","Two stars means that I don't like it. I expected a lot better in an expensive chopping knife and maybe my expectations were too high........The most important thing for me is that knives be super sharp and hold that sharpness at the least, after a few uses....The larger of the two went DULL on me AFTER THE SECOND USE! Wasn't the sharpest to begin with either. The smaller blade wasn't sharp enough at the start either, but it at least stayed sharp through 4 uses.............now is dull as the bigger blade knife. I used these knives to cut potatoes, a tomato, and an onion and diced celery..............???? In my opinion, they failed."
3,Good for budget conscious,"We have the nicer grade of Henckels that cost around $100/knife; but I thought we might want to get this set as an everyday, general-use set.I think they perform ok, but it is obvious to me that the steel in the blade is lesser quality and not worthy of the brand name. The handle is definitely also much lighter. To boil it down, in order to use these knives effectively, they need to be sharpened after nearly every use. That's a bit too frequent for my taste; but at the end of the day, it does have decent design for comfort.Definitely much better than a generic knife you'd find at Target, but not close to their higher quality brothers."
2,Not as good as I anticipated,"The quality of the blade & handle are fine considering the low prices. Unfortunately, there are 2 issues: (1) The top side of the blade and the side adjacent to the handle are quite sharp and it may ""cut"" into into my fingers. (2) The part of the handle that meets the blade is not straight and cannot be stored properly in a regular shealth/cover, eg Messermeister covers carried by Amazon."
5,Sharp,Very good quality knives. Sharp and machine washable. Have to be careful usibg these nit to cut myself. Hahaha. Also like the fact that I don't have to buy 20 of them.
4,Great Santoku Set,"Great Santoku set. I was pleasantly surprised how sharp they actually were. Great Price at $15.84. The handles could be a little more comfortable, but for the price I'am very satisfied."
1,Not Good For a Busy Family!,"In our family of four, the calendar is quite full. I bought this calendar since it claimed to be so spacious and organized. NOT! The boxes for each day may be an acceptable size, but there are so many little pictures scattered across the page, trying to make the calendar ""cute"", that it makes it unusable! (For instance, we have 3 activities and 2 birthdays on Oct. 29 -- but 2/3 of the day is taken up by a picture of a girl writing on a BLACKboard! So you can't read anything! And thankfully we aren't as busy on Oct. 28 because it is even worse!)I like the CONCEPT of this calendar -- the pocket, the magnetic mount for the fridge, the large spaces for each day. But again, the little pictures make it completely impractical. They take up too much space and they are so distracting that you lose the whole point of the calendar -- the birthdays and activities you are trying to keep track of."
5,Mom's Plan It Plus,This calendar is the best. It has plenty of space for writing everyone in your family's daily activities. It is adorable. It has lots of stickers for those special occassions. The best part is it has a magnet so it can stay on the refrigerator. My whole family loves it. I recommend it to all of my friends and family.
5,Great buy,"I lucked up and got this baby for $1,000 even w/ free shipping. The HD and digital cable picture is flawless and the sound is great even w/o surround speakers.Plenty of features including the PC hookup which is friggen great. I didn't think I'd use that at all but I went ahead and hooked up a wireless mouse and keybord to my PC which means I can do everything I want on my machine but now I have a 56"" screen"
2,disappointed,"Initially, I too thought that paying $175.00 for a plastic doll house was a bit over-the-top. But, blinded by the love of my brown eyed little munchkin, I too, fell victim to the hype. No where in the description of this doll house were the words ""MANUALLY CONTROLLED"" elevator. Not only is it manually controlled (string on a pulley), but the elevator gets stuck between floors courtesy of misalligned plastic guides. The JACUZZI, as it is, is not. Where are the bubbles that appeared on the box? The ""JACUZZI"" is simply a big bowl that, in it's defense, does hold water. This doll house is by far the most overhyped, and misrepresented toy I have purchased. I guess I should have read the fine print."
2,Too much!,It's a dream come true that the Bratz finally have their own house to chill in. This is something I really want to add to my collection but I simply cannot afford it! $200 for a doll house is utterly ridiculous!I'm an adult and I cannot afford this! This house should cost $100 at the very least. What makes MGA think that parents will shell out $200 bucks for a toy? I am very upset and disappointed. MGA needs to lower their prices! Word to the wise: wait about 6 months and I'm sure the price will go down.
4,Bratz Pad,"The overall design and construction is good, considering that this is for older girls. I was dissapointed that it did not come with more furniture, but I was more dissapointed that there were no accesories for a doll house this expensive. Accesories should be design so you can add more fun to the pad. My daughter is pleased, anyway."
3,"Too costly!!!! But....heck.... it's Christmas, right?!","I was so excited when I found out that the Bratz were getting their own house! Finally! But why does MGA have to make their products so costly? I'm sure parents like myself will find some way to surprise our daughters with this toy on Christmas day. I have always loved the Bratz and all of their accessories but most are too pricey! I also wish they would slow down on the doll production and make more clothes to purchase. The house is cool, jaccuzzi, working elevator, but again, it would have been great at about $99.00 don't you all agree?????"
2,high price high rise,"I feel this doll house is way over priced! When I took my daughters to buy it at toysrus they did not want it! They said it is to small inside. They chose the imaginarium doll house instead and with the money I saved I filled it with lots of cool furniture, carpet and lights its awsome!!! We did it together so it really paid off not to buy the bratz high rise. We still love the bratz dolls and they love thier new funky pad we made for them to chill out in."
3,Over Priced and disapointing,"I bought this house for my 10 year old daughter who is a big bratz fan and has most of the dolls and playsets. Although this house was very funky and cool looking we were very disapointed. For the money ($250) we expected alot more. The elevator was operated by a string... for this money we atleast expected it to be batery operated like the barbie dream house. The directions we not very helpful to put this together and it was not the most sturdy playset we have, one of the walls is not level and easily comes apart. There are 2 lights that are batery operated but not that impresive for the money. If the price was alot less I could recomend it for the cool style and the 3 levels. There are other more impressive playsets that bratz puts out."
2,BROKE AND DISGUSTED,"I am so broke and disgusted for purchasing this product...words cannot explain. Don't believe the hype. The discription of this Bratz Pad is very exaggerated just like the price. This was the only toy my daughter had on her wish list for Christmas so I broke the bank to get it for her and she wasn't even able to play with it because the MANUAL CRANK elevator, tied to a piece of string like a yo-yo would be, failed to operate. The poorly made barstools kept falling out of their little holes. The jacuzzi is a joke. There were so many tiny accessories that she didn't want to take them out of the package for fear of losing them. Which was smart because now we have to return it for one that works. Yes, she still wants to keep it as long as it works. Children are so forgiving. But I'm broke and disgusted![...]"
1,not cool ? well will see,i loved this when i saw it but when i opened it it was stuipduncool not fun iteits would not even play with it a 2 ( year old) wouldnot play with it good for me i though it out my bedroom windowi was sick of bratz i hated them at that point it was stupidto even make bratz who ever made bratz was a foul of crap thanksfor lisening
2,wrong title,"while this short book wasn't really all that bad, the title is very misleading. it's specifically for individuals dealing with being separated from their military spouse who is deployed. while i am in a long distance relationship with a soldier in the army, he thankfully isn't deployed, but it is still a long distance relationship. there wasn't really any useful advice in the book for me and i'm not really sure there would be any useful advice in the book even for someone with a deployed spouse. most of it is pretty common sense. instead of buying this book, i'd suggest saving your money to send your long-distance loved one a care package."
3,3 stars,"Good Night, Henry is pretty standard women's fiction:Heroine raising 2 sons, check.Preternaturally understanding boyfriend (even to the point of not minding that her estranged husband moves into the guesthouse on the property), check.One of the kids has a handicap (one arm ends at the elbow), check. Beloved brother disappears, husband ran off after handicapped son was born, heroine can't trust any men because ""they all go away,"" check.Ho-hum. And people say ROMANCE is predictable. Gah.The kids were pretty well done, with their reactions to their father returning, and to the younger boy's stump arm, so I gave it an extra star."
2,over rated and presumptuous,"The writer worked too hard at trying to be poetic and sophisticated.Did not work for me.(I KNOW daffodils don't have a fragrance....)The book did not have a natural flow, it was just to awfull and presumptuous. And I cannot stand books that have guidelines for bookclubs, just assuming they have depth .A typical book concocted by a college professor trying to be a writer and a lot of people falling for it..."
2,"Great performance from Simon Yam, but a below average movie","There are a lot of good things to say about this movie. First of all it has a good look. The visual appeal of it is going to keep you watching for at least a little while. It also has good actors. Simon Yam gives a great performance, and Alex Fong and Kent Cheng do pretty good. The movie is interesting at times, but the biggest letdown is the action. There's tons of fights, but it's not choreographed very well and nothing really exciting happens. It's not Dog Bite Dog bad, but don't go into this expecting good action. If you are a Simon Yam megafan, then you have to see this, otherwise, there's plenty of other good Chinese gangster flicks out there that actually deliver with high suspense, good action... things that I look for in a movie.2.5/5I don't really have much to say about this movie, I just wanted to tell people to seek out the legit Mei Ah DVD, and not the horrible full screen World Media DVD that is being sold here."
4,"Nice string, I have heard better","This is just my personal opinion, everyone has theirs. I liked these because they lasted longer than normal, but I did not care for the sound. Seemed a little dead."
4,What a relief!,"Though somewhat predictable, Waterdance was the most enjoyable book I have read in a long time. It's a jump-right-in, quick paced book that is impossible to put down. And those who are suckers for a romantic secondary plot, like myself, should find it all the more engaging. It's the perfect relief from all those slow, heavy, and depressing ""classic"" books so commonly read (and dreaded) in school."
4,"If you're serious, get the book","There are many basic ideas in here that I wouldn't have really thought of on my own. It gives many ideas that you can use with the simplest of scraps laying around in your garage. Simple does not mean easy, but I can say that my forearm training improved almost immediately. Small details DO lead to big differences."
2,didn't like it,the excercises proposed pose a risk to your column and back. Lifting a rock from the ground doesn't sound like a good drill!
5,Utterly unique,"Sure, you might expect to see someone performing an entire album with rubber bands; after all, humans are known for their ingenuity in turning household items into musical instruments. Yet who could have dreamed an album would appear consisting solely of CHRISTMAS SONGS played by the aforementioned stretchy rings? Though the sound of rubber bands giving voice to Yuletide tunes may grow a wee bit tiresome after the first ten tracks, I've chosen to give this disc 5 stars for its audacity alone. They dared to dream, my friends...a dream in which the beautiful music of Noel would be played by that most useful useful of office supplies, the rubber band. I salute the inspired musicians -- yes I said it, MUSICIANS -- who brought this exciting dream to fruition, and who made our lives just a little bit brighter with their efforts. Tune in, turn on, pluck out!"
1,FOR MASOCHISTS ONLY,"Did you like it when the teacher squeaked the chalk on the blackboard? Or when somebody rubbed a balloon? Are you enchanted by the sound of felines rutting in the alley? Then this is the album for you!Annoying, nonmusical stuff for anyone who thinks John Cage is too melodic.Save a few bucks and just rattle your trash can instead."
1,DEFECTIVE,PRODUCT DEFECTIVE IN THAT IT DID NOT PLAY ANY CD WITHOUT A SCRATCHING NOISE RIGHT FROM FIRST DISC PLAYED. THIS ITEM RETURNED IMMEDIATELY.
4,Good vintage Ray Charles,"This is a compilation of songs that K-Tel put together some from the cd of the orinigal name, others are obscuritys to me ""Margie"" ,I Beleive in My Soul and quite a few others. the sound quality is very good as is the material. This is a true representation of Ray doing blues, some of the material had to be recorded in the early fifties as it is mono transfer to stereo. Yet you get to hear Ray before he was famous in "" I've had my fun(going down slow)and the early interpation of C.C. Rider when Ray's voice was smoother. All in all not bad for the price."
2,A waste of money,The sound quality of this cd is very low fi.There is no bass and the horns on one cut almost cant be heard.There are many better Ray Charles cds with more blues.A waste of money.
5,"Beautiful, Peaceful, Tranquil........ A must have....","Words cannot describe how beautiful the wording and the music is brought forth in this meditation...... The narrarotor has such a calm and soothing voice. It really helps me to relax, and i am usually asleep before the recroding is over... The way he describes the colors and the attributes that go along with them is breath-taking..........."
3,Her Timing Was Somewhat Off,"Hey, I love me some Mo'Nique but...this concert wasnot really that funny. She spent too much time talkingabout her divorce. I think she could have diversifiedher subject matter a little bit more. She was much morefunny in her segment for Queens Of Comedy. I really believethere's so much more to her we haven't discovered yet...sostay tuned."
4,Any Mo'Nique stand up DVD is going to be good,This is a great show. She is always funny. She is also always raunchy and swears like it's going out of style so be prepared for that. Certainly not family night material. But I love her comedies. I've watched it many times.
3,An Invitation to Indian Cooking,"I was led to Indian cooking via a chef, who is a friend of mine. I tasted his version of Chicken Masala, which he credited to Madhur Jaffrey. I had been to a highly regarded Indian Restaurant just the previous evening, ate the same dish, and his was incredibly better. Afterward decided to buy this book. As yet, I have not had a chance to make any of the recipes, but have skimmed through and found many interesting. I've noticed the great detail of the cooking methods and the explanations and interesting food combinations suggested. My only disappointment is, that Madhur's recipe for Chicken Masala is not in this book! But my friend promised to share it with me."
4,Especially for us,"I bought this book based on a review I read at RecipeDelights.com. I just wanted to share it with you- Madhur Jaffrey is an international authority on Indian food and the host of several tandoori-driven TV shows. This illustrated book, with more than 200 recipes has been written especially for non-Indians. She walks you through each step of the process. Just follow her detailed directions and you will end up with mouth-watering dishes. HTH."
3,Not what I expected,"This purchase makes me realize I will need to listen to the demos before buying in the future! I don't know exactly what I expected from this CD but being a fan of Hooked on Classics, I thought it would be an upbeat sort of meandering through some tunes that were instantly recognizable and maybe nostaglic (relive those good old days of music history). It is not that though. It is a compliation of great songs, however sung by some generic group of folks. The ""Hooked on"" style is there, but it is just not exceptional."
3,ONLY 3 MINUTES OF TONY BURROWS ???!!!!!!!????,"WHAT INITIALLY BROUGHT MY ATTENTION TO THIS COMPILAQTION WAS A DISCOGRAPHY OF THE GREAT TONY BURROWS I SAW ON A JAPANESE SITE... BUT WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT IT IS TO HEAR HIM SING 30 SECONDS OF EACH SONG-HE ONLY SINGS SIX BY HIMSELF. EVEN THOUGH IT IS HIS VOICE AND THE SONGS WERE SMASH HITS IN THEIR DAY, I WISH THEY HAD BEEN A LITTLE LONGER. BUT IT IS AN ALBUM OF MEDLEYS...I STILL WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT IF IT JUST HAD THOSE SIX SONGS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE EDISON LIGHTHOUSE ON TOP OF THE POPS WHEN I WENT TO ENGLAND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1970 AND HAVE REMAINED A STAUNCH FAN SINCE. MAYBE HE'LL GET BACK INTO THE STUDIOS SOON !!!!"
2,Too much science and not enough tennis advice.,"I did not read the entire book, but quickly reviewed it upon receiving it so please consider that my review is based on a quick glance. I anticipated the book would center on the lighter side of science and be aimed at helping the weekend tennis player make better on court decisions. It apperared to focus on tennis equipment with less information on science based strategy...although it did have some useful insights into the physical aspects of the game. It would have been a much better book if the information was presented from a tennis player's viewpoint with a little humor to lighten it up. Far too many graphs and charts when a good cartoon would have made the point much stand out much better."
1,What is it?,There is no indication of what kind of cleaner this is.It it a steam cleaner? a vacuum cleaner? a spit cleaner?What the ..... is it?
4,Huntsman,I read a lot of reviews before I settled on this compass. I hunt and use it for deep woods. So far I've been happy with overall product. It holds true north and works perfect for my needs. I did not need an expensive military compass. I only rated 4 stars because the lid is slightly flimsy.
2,Not a good value,"While this is a nice chart to have, I feel that it is definitely not worth $9.99. The text is too small for a ""wall chart"" and there is a useful reference matrix on the back that you can't see once you hang it up. I would improve this product by putting the matrix on the front at the bottom and doubling the size. The it would be more useful as a ""wall chart"" and worth the $9.99"
2,small and printed on both sides,I was disappointed with this - while the content of the poster is good - it is small (A3) and has print on both sides so you will need 2 if you really wish to post it up!
3,"Still a great space pen, but there are better models.","Still the same great space pen, but the black part pictured is all plastic, and doesn't grip as nicely as the all black military version which you can routinely get for cheaper (roughly $8.50 if you wait for the right time) or the traditional cap-o-matic, and this simply doesn't quite feel as substantial or durable. I will still use it all the time, but i wouldn't get the same one again."
5,GREAT little pen!,"My husband got a Space Pen for Christmas from one of our kids, and I tried it. It wrote beautifully on all kinds of paper and other materials, so I decided I wanted one too. I got this one (almost exact model of my husband's)and I love, love love it!! BEST pen I ever owned! I recommend it highly!"
5,Answers Questions All of Us Have Wondered About,The bible does have answers we all have wondered about but we need help in learning how to study the bible by topics as we also read the entire bible. Great book for your library.
3,Item Not As Described,"This is a really well made, well designed router bit that's not what's pictured or described. The one I received is labeled item 48-23-6455 just like the description, but the same label also indicates that this is a 3-1/2"" cove panel raising bit (which is accurate), not the 2-3/4"" ogee bit that's described and shown above. Nice bit, just not what I expected."
4,GREAT KITCHEN RESOURCE,"This is a good book that doesn't offer too many recipes...I already like my OWN recipes! But, what it does do is highlights many ingredients I already use, and let's me know what magical properies they have. This allows me to customize my own recipes to express the magical intention (along with flavorful intention) I am crafting. It could use MORE ingredients,(which is why I gave it a 4*and not a 5*,. as there are some common ones that are missing, but overall it is a good reference for the magical kitchen."
3,"Great for practical, everyday use","Cunningham is of course a household name for this sort of book. The nice bit about the cookbook is the daily applications. Practical, easy to work into daily life, I love it. --HK Savage, author/ publisher. Staccato Publishing"
4,Wicca in the Kitchen,"Present for my neice, she loved it. Started using it the day it arrived.Thank you!"
4,Wicca in the Kitchen,I love this yummy book and it is fill with great information and is one of my go to books
2,Works fine if you don't staple much...,"Problem being, I use my stapler about 50 times a day. After a while, these jam up and can be quite annoying. If you use your stapler infrequently, this is a fine unit. It you use yours often, I'd recommend a higher end stapler like the 747."
3,Works well for price rubber base has bad odor to it,"Odor to rubber base, works well for price . Will try and put tape on base so odor does not transfer to hands."
1,Leandro,bad product. One button fall. Amazon send me another. Uno de los botones se desprendio a penas con una semana de uso. Amazon me envió otro producto pero siempre queda la desconfianza
3,Basic Wired Computer,"After previously buying an RT55HD (no longer made) I hastily bought this one too, hoping it would be similar. Don't get me wrong...it works great & is accurate if programmed with the correct tire size. But it only tells current speed, odometer, trip odometer & the clock. My fault - I didn't read the description close enough.If you want or need one that tells total trip time & average speed, look into a better one. So I own two now made by Vetta on two different bikes. Both are easy to set up & easy to use. Rugged - won't accidently pop off as some other brands do."
1,Don't Buy! Doesn't Work.....,"...at least not on mountain bikes. Your tire spokes have to be inordinately CLOSE to your bike's fork in order for the magnet to register as it revolves by the sensor.First, the package was shipped with a dead battery. Strike one. $5 additional bucks later I got the computer programmed - difficult with the written instructions, opt for the mini-dvd version, it's easier to read. The magnet was very difficult to attached to the spokes, very poor design there. Strike two. Then attached the sensor, and had to use homemade spacers (faucet washers) and the only way the seonsor would register was if the sensor was so far extended it actually interferred with the tire's rotation!!!! BIG strike three.Perhaps this would work on a touring bike, or a racing bike, but whichever style it should have spokes that are between 1/8th and 1/16th of an inch away from the fork."
1,Pass on this one,"Really, really disappointing product. The fit was very poor and I had to fabricate my own bracket. I bought this because the stock airbox was literally falling apart. I didn't expect to see any gains in gas mileage - and didn't - but the worst part is the increase in noise - the motor is VERY loud now, like I'm running a fart can exhaust on the back end. I gotta believe there are better options than this one - best to pass on it."
4,Traditional Irish folk music from the 1960s.,"This is a nice 2-CD collection of early work by this Irish brother duet, who later formed the nucleus of the Fureys family band. This set draws from two albums originally on the Transatlantic label, their self-titled debut from 1968, and 1969's ""The Lonesome Boatman,"" as well as some material from an album of solo piping music by Finbar Furey. The music is a bit stark, heavy on the uillean pipes, and a bit light on the vocals (though when Eddie Finbar sings, it's quite nice). An excellent example of the emerging Irish folk revival of the 1960s. Didn't entirely wow me, but it's definitely worth checking out."
4,an inspiring surprise!,"This was a refreshing surprise! i did my usual go-find-some-unknown-cheap-gems in downtown music shops. i did! i struck gold when i picked this one out. i have many many gems, this is one of them. usually i'll go for instrumentation, producer, guest appearance, sometimes label. in this case it was the cover, and the instrumentation: B3 Hammond, the Sax. i like Rock that dares to have Horns, but not like a cheap solo in a pop song. Anyway, this is rocking music, energetic and melodic, very dynamic and alert, guiding the listener through beautiful sometimes dark storytelling. the production is pristine, and the composition and musicianship are a breath of fresh air. truly a joy to listen over and over to this CD. it's a good band, and i hope they continue even as individuals to perform elsewhere. NICE!"
3,"Quick read, informative but I dislike the title","It was okie. I read this for the body language & communication synchronizing parts. (tho I read the entire book) Loved the quiz bout figuring out ppl's primary mode of communicating with the world: Kinesthesis, Visual, Auditory ... I always wondered about things like that but never actually saw it explained before (@ least in a basic way). It was a cool quick read & pretty informative in a nice simple way.The title of the book is horrendous tho! Sorta belittles the work inside with that cheap marketing gimmick of a title. Kinda sad cuz the information & science is promising"
4,Awesome.,Great book. I'm pretty outgoing but I learned alot from this book and how to read others. Great for a salesperson. I received pretty quick and happy with everything.
1,Save your money,"This book is an expensive waste of money. Carefully read all the reviews below and you'll have gotten the gist of the book's contents... about 5 pages of useful info padded out to 172 pages.Even better, buy and absorb Ian Rowland's Full Facts Book of Cold Reading at ianrowland dot com which will tell you everything in this book and more in straight English without all the pseudoscience and NLP hocus pocus.Regardless, if you are a poor listener, you aren't looking for a book to improve yourself. And if you think you need a book about being a good listener, you probably already are a pretty good one."
3,helpful,"I found this book really interesting and helpful in approaching people in particular to meeting new people and building a rapport. In some areas such as body language and congruency in delivering communication it overlapped with my training in social work, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to meet people in everyday situations. If you have a background in social work or counselling chances are these are skills you already possess, great to recommend to clients though."
3,"Easy to read, but light on substance","It's a decent pamphlet for those who need the most basic of primers. It's a quick and easy read and has some good tips, but if you're serious about learning how to improve your people skills, your money and time will be better spent on Leil Lowndes' ""How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships"" instead. It's an updated take on Dale Carnegie classic ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", which give you clear steps for improving your rapport with others."
4,"Slow start, but many good tips","As with many books this one spent too long at the beginning trying to build the case that you want people to like you. Obviously the reader agrees or they would not be waisting their time. Once he got into the substance though the book had some amazing points and many good tips. I will likely re-read to pick up a few more that I may have missed. If you are a social person, but want to take it to the next level this book provides great insight to do that."
2,I didnt like it at all,Fluff talk at their best. The only useful information is to smile while you are saying your name to a new guy. There are some ridiculous information's like mirroring the other guy so that he likes you....ARE WE SERIOUS? I will mirror him? Personally im not a woman and if i were i don't get it...mirror somebody? What we want is communication and fun not to be actors. I don't know but even if i have to mirror somebody ...what happens if there are more than one guy?Find other books about this subject.........
4,"For best results, read and read again","This book repeats what I've often read that every person controls his own attitude. I found Nicholas Boothman's ideas for getting people to open up and communicate both interesting and informative. However, to get the most out of this book, I would suggest reading it several times; easily done as it's only 171 pages."
3,"Short read, nothing eye-opening","I bought this as I approached graduation. It came highly recommended as a book to brush up on the fundamentals of networking and interviewing. I was a little disappointed. The book is a little new-agey at times, and nowhere near as useful as Dale Carnegie's ""How to Make Friends and Influence People"".I didn't learn anything concretely useful, or even identify things that I notice my persuasive, charismatic friends do. It isn't a bad book, but it didn't help me the way I wanted and it is much shorter and lighter than I expected given the rave recommendation I received."
2,"sorry, but this book is just not on the mark.","sorry, but this book is just not on the mark. Weak, just not much of a help at all. There has to be better out there."
2,Some good advice mixed with New Age mumbo-jumbo,"This book has some good advice, such as telling you to smile and ask open-ended questions, but for the most part it is a waste of time. Much of it is silly ideas based on pseudoscience."
4,This will make people like you,"I've decided that this book does in fact serve it's purpose - to make people like you. It starts by helping you connect better with people, & I really like the piece on determining if the person is auditory or visual (or kino). I used this as a good start, & later moved on to the more obvious: Fate & Reil's How to have sex with hot girls (without even dating them), & Louis & Copeland's How to succeed with women."
3,usefull but a little boring,I think it is usefull but is a little boring especially if english is not your first language
4,A good guide to creating an instant connection,"A short read that lays out a specific plan for creating an instant connection with people. It covers body language, appearance, words, and attitude. My favorite chapter was on attitudes, and how they can work for you or against you in creating a connection. The section on body language was also very informative. Very good for anyone who wants to have a better experience in their personal interactions."
2,"Very, very basic","While the information is okay, if you've read anything at all on management, working with others, sales, self improvement or any other self help type book you most likely already know what is written here. I quickly went through about half the book and finally had to remove it from my devise. Seriously, if you are brand new to any of this information you might find it interesting but I imagine for the average reader this will be about as basic as one can get."
3,A Few Good Lessons but Not Very Practical,"The author over-simplifies the solution to making people like us to a few techniques based Neuro Linguistic Research theory. The reader is expected to evaluate a stranger based on that persons preferred type of sensory input and to react appropriately to it. This technique would seem of limited value given the many changing moods, predjudices, likes, dislikes and bias's that will confound any valid determination of ""sensory type"" (and what if your determination is wrong or you have to talk to more then one person at a time or you're just boring?). Little time is devoted to any new conversational techniques, over-coming personal shyness, speaking with more then 1 person at a time, physical appearance, or the tremendous value of being a well rounded, knowledgeable person - a person who actually has something worth listening to."
2,Not enough info on dining and lodging outside Cancun,"I haven't been to the Yucatan in over 6 years, and purchased this book hoping it would have updated info on the area, as I was planning vacation there soon.I couldn't find enough listings for lodgings and restarants to satisfy me, and wound up going to the web to get the info I needed. There are so many more hotels and condos south of Cancun, and even south of Tulum that just weren't listed. None of the restaurants we ate at were even listed. I couldn't use this guide for my purposes."
4,Pretty good book. Lots of Info and Phone # which is needed!,I bought this book. There is a lot of info. I would of liked a little more info on Cancun but over all its really good as has 1-800 numbers to the hotels as well!
3,It's Growing On Me,"Ok - the disk has been out for 3 mos and it's slowly slowly slowly growing on me. That's good and bad. Usually I have a much more immediate connection w/Lucinda's music, but that didn't happen this time. On the other hand, at least is IS growing on me.I was a huge fan of 'Essence', which got mixed reviews as not being enough like 'Car Wheels...', and now I'm being just as bad as comparing this review to 'Essence'. Sorry in advance.Stand-out cuts on 'World..' for me are ""Fruits of my Labor"", ""Ventura"", ""Bleeding Fingers"", ""Over Time"" and ""Minneapolis"". But what is up w/""Atonement""? Not for me.I'm hoping in 6 mos to edit this review and that somehow, somewhere this album moves up to 4 stars - but now, it stand at 3."
2,Not Happy,"I love the work of Lucinda Williams; I have and play every album of the last decade. It is of concern to me that this album is so weak when compared to past works. A quaint almost campy country style is found here and it evokes pretentions to being a country Leonard Cohen stumbling through a qualude induced haze that affects both the writing and the delivery. Get some rest, drink some coffee, get well!!"
4,Objectivity is difficult to achieve.,"From the first I heard Lucinda Williams, she could do no wrong w/me. I got started late in her career, so this represents the backwards examination of her body of work. I can't claim objectivity, however. Her voice, her band, and her songs all have a humor and a pathos to them, sometimes at the same time. I don't have everything she's done, yet. But Iwill, and if you like real country and real rock blended with a real sharp edge, you will too."
1,Don't believe everything you read...,"This is rubbish. Props to the lyrical aspect, but please, please, have someone with talent sing the words next time. My first and last experience with Lucinda."
2,Steep decline,"Although not the self parody that Essence was, WWT continues the steep decline in William's music. Although her increased production (2 albums in 3 years) may be good financially, as an artist Williams may actually need the five year gestation period that produced Car Wheels. Although still a distinctive vocalist, the music has drifted from a uniquely personal blues style to generic rock and country-- and there are at least two songs (Sweet Side and American Dream) that are the worst songs ANYONE has ever written. Bottom line is: buy the old records."
1,Disappointed,Righteously is the only song on the album I like. Unless you really need this to complete your collection I wouldn't buy it. Essence and Car Wheels on a Gravel Road are by far much better.
1,Her worst,"I've always been a big fan of Lucinda and loved her albums to death. That said, I HATE this album. I don't see this in the cd player ever again. There is not one song on this album I'd like to hear again. Maybe she should take 5 years between albums like she used to."
1,Will quickly Find The Shelf,"This is no ""Car Wheels"", believe me. I know it is a ""Rock"" album, but there is not one upbeat song...not one. The best song is Righteously and it is OK. There are several songs that are so slow and boring, that they sound like filler to me. ..."
2,fall from grace,"on this collection, lucinda sings like she's on the edge of a heroin overdose, and she uses the f-word on one song when she could have been more subtle and more poetic. i find this gratuitious use of carnal slang offensive. when i was younger, i found it titillating. i suppose that means lucinda is gunning for a younger audience. best of luck to her. on the matter of ""masterpiece,"" apparently some people believe that the more despairing the tone of a song or songs, the better it is/they are. ... this doesn't come close to ""wheels."""
4,Another Gem,"Her voice is as beautiful, her lyrics as poetic, and her songs as true as they have ever been. Another unbeatable album from Lucinda, ""World Without Tears"" incorporates a wide range of the many sounds and structures of her entire catalog (think of the dynamic changes between ""Car Wheels"" and ""Essence."") Ms. Williams ventures into previously unexplored musical territory as well, with two spoken/rapped tracks. Standout songs include ""Ventura"" and ""Three Days."" America's greatest woman songwriter continues to deliver...be thankful that we did not have to wait 6 years for this gift."
4,"blood on the tracks, floor and barstool.","I've never listened to Lucinda Williams before so I had no preconceptions about what she's supposed to sound like. This is a haunting killer collection of songs that eats at you. The production reminds me a lot of Dylan's Oh Mercy.How can anyone complain about her voice sounding ragged? She's not exactly waxing about sunny days. She sounds, pissed, wounded, wornout, heartbroken and fearless. There's just one great track after another.Over Time sounds like a forgotten track from the 50s that you hear and go, where the hell has that song been? The malaise of loneliness in Ventura that leads into that wonderful chorus of ""I wanna watch the ocean bend the edges of the sun..."" makes you wanna cry and her angry lament for a weekend affair she can't get over in ""Those Three Days"" is damn near perfect. Hell of a record."
3,lacks cohesion or vision,"Unfortunately Lucinda Williams does not live up to her 1998,""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"". Meandering, scattered, and often self-indulgent, some very good songs get lost in that mix... Moreover, her voice gets irritatingly grating at times (or is it the studio mixing?). However, fans will enjoy it, being still well above average for the singer-songwriter genre."
4,Better Than Essence.......Not As Good As Car Wheels,"I found World Without Tears well worth the wait though i liked the first half of the cd better than the last half. I think Fruits Of My Labor has to be one of the top 5 songs she's ever written......it's just gorgeous and so is Ventura. I didnt' really care too much for Atonement or American Dream......Those songs have a ""forced"" feel to them........I mean, hasn't Springsteen already covered the Viet Nam and jobless thing? I think so. Overall, it's well worth the price......a solid cd."
5,An absolute classic!,"This album is as genuine as they come. Original and straight from the heart. Make sure to add this to your collection. You'll want the whole CD, trust me!"
4,Believe the hype,"I was fortunate enough to hear Lucinda Williams perform many of these tracks live in Boston, MA last year, so I had an idea of what this cd would sound like. There is a great mix here, some remeniscent of Sweet Old World and some more like Essence and Car Wheels...What's nice is there are a couple of tracks like ""Righteously"" and ""Sweet Side"" that won't remind you of anything else Lucinda has recorded. My personal favorite is the opening track, ""Fruits Of My Labor"", which highlights the great acoustics of the venue where this cd was recorded. If you're a Lucinda Williams fan...add this one to your collection. If not, start with ""Car Wheels On A Gravel Road"", but don't be afraid to pick this one up, too. Enjoy!"
3,Not her best,"When they collect Lucinda's best work, there will be a few songs from this album. ""Righteously,"" ""Those Three Days,"" and ""Real Live Bleeding Fingers and Broken Guitar Strings"" all belong on a compilation. But Williams overreaches, and it can be painful at times. ""Atonement"" can be kindly called ill-advised, and many other tracks aren't up to her very high Car Wheels on a Gravel Road and self-titled standards. Maybe she really does need six years to make an album."
4,Another Go At It,"This is another Lucinda Williams album that you'll need to live with for awhile before it sinks in deep enough to rattle your heart. It's everything the critics say it is: literary, melancholy, beautiful. It is at times hard edged. At other times I can't help feel that Lucinda's giving me more of herself than a stranger ought to know. But how can you fault an artist for bearing herself so purely? So ... play the record for awhile. Let it resonate. And emerge in its own way."
3,A must for serious Lucinda fans- don't bother for casual,"I was very happy when this CD started off with Fruits Of My Labor- what a great Lucinda song! Righteous is also a fine song, as are Ventura, Bleeding Fingers, Over Time and Those Three Days. Then we get Atonement and Sweet Side- I listened to them once, but don't want to haer them again! They should have been saved for a CD non-LP track. Same for American Dream. Minneapolis is good, People Talkin' and the last two tracks are OK. Let's hope Lucinda got a lot of this out of her system and the next CD will be more in the vein of Essence."
3,Not all she's cracked up to be,"Lucinda W. is the type of singer/songwriter people love to gush all over. She has the requisite gravelly, mumbly voice and hard livin' lifestyle. Too bad none of it, and I'm speaking of the music as well as her posturing, comes across as genuine. It's just a little too affected, a little too desperate to be ""raw."" You'll hear a lot of talk of ""genius"" and ""masterpiece,"" words which, in an age when they turn up in every third album review in any given music magazine, have long ago lost all meaning. This isn't the worst thing I've ever heard but it's far from the best. She merely sounds like the melancholy sister of Chrissie Hynde or Tom Petty. Many of her gooey-eyed legion would argue that I just don't ""get it."" They're right. I don't. I don't hear ""art."" I hear a not bad album by a decent singer/songwriter and nothing more. To say it (or she) is anything more than that is wishful thinking."
4,This book is OK,"I can't see why anyone would get excited about this one, I am not impressed, but it is a lot better than misleading MUSIC BOOKS I have purchased."
3,Fakebook,"The book is OK there are many hand written comments and guides in on the pages, some take away from the song."
5,Very Easy Fake Book's,The Easy Fake Book and Your First Fake Book both have very good song selections in them. I would recomend however first buying How To Play From A Fake Book (which I purchased later) because it explains more about how to use these books. They are all very exellent books and I will be back for more. Thank You.
1,Faith or Reason?,"Either you take your astrology on faith and subscribe to inventive, creative models and procedures, or you accept the long and venerable tradition of this wondrous ancient craft and listen up to our predecessors. This book is a perfect example of where modern astrology goes right off the rails. If I'm going for a ""made-up"" version of astrology, I'll do it for myself rather than take another's ""rantings"" and ""visionary"" knowledge at face value.Green's book adds nothing to the real core of astrological understanding. Instead he shines an hallucinatory light on a ""planet"" which has no light, and which deserves to be placed way down in the hierarchy of any delineation or practice of astrology. Do yourself a favour and read a book by a traditional author on essential principles of astrology.For me this book was a complete waste of time - another modern ""cookbook"" of deluded two-dimensional astrology."
4,From the back cover:,"Once, Julianna had been plain Julie Ann, the girl from the wrong side of the tracks who had dared to love beyond her station. Amazingly, Gray Sheridan, scion of the local dynasty, had loved her, too - enough to marry her. But sometimes love is not enough...Ten years later they met again. She was successful, beautiful, as different from her old self as night from day. But one thing had stayed the same: the love she and Gray shared, a love that, this time, would be enough - and more."
5,Very useful,"I have backpacked and camped for years, but when I decided to try canoe camping, I had questions. This book provided guidance. First, we were going to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and that's the focus area of this book. From Roughing It Elegantly, we gained a better idea of how to pack and portage a canoe, and learned about how canoeists pace themselves. I also got some great recipes! This book spends a good deal of time discussing the pleasantries of canoeing to and through a wild area, not just describing how to lug equipment. A pleasant and useful read."
2,Good production. Poor content.,"I haven't really seen the CD's. But this is the full version of what's available on the website funwitharabic. With the exception of the alphabet song, I have two major comments on this CD:- First, it teaches many words in colloquial Egyptian Arabic. Which is fine if that was your purpose.- Second, and more importantly, it has many inappropriate words that I would not teach to kids. Many of them revolve around going out, beer, sheesha, etc. While the alphabet song was nice and might give the impression it's done for kids, but the rest of the material is certainly not suitable.Be careful and check the website before buying the CDs."
3,the editor's preface,"Michael P. Foley's ""Editor's Preface"" to this edition of Confessions contextualizes the translation well. It serves to locate Sheed's translation historically and academically. The ""Editor's Preface"" also discusses the cover art for this edition. That discussion is not only an insightful description of the art, but also relates the art to the text effectively."
2,Philosophy isn't my strong point,"Augustine's Confessions is not for the faint of heart. With a lot of confusing backpedaling, this book has confused many a philosopher. Chronicling his search for God and acceptance, this is a semi-autobiographical account of Augustine's life. He tackles a variety of topics, but the only reason I can see anyone reading this book is for a college course. In which case, I have to say, good luck to you, your life got worse. 2/5"
2,"Nice Looks, Poor Software","The phone looks nice and is made pretty well. It held up to daily use in my pocket for over a year and I never gave much thought to protecting it. It survived drops to the street. It survived a complete soaking while I was caught in a rain storm with the phone in the pocket of my cycling jersey. I liked the small size a lot.The software on the phone, however, is complete garbage. I don't know how it is that Motorola sells so many of these (and it's older brother, the RAZR). The menus are slow and unresponsive. Setting the alarm takes - at minimum - 7 clicks (with lag in between). That's assuming you are simply enabling an alarm you had already set up. If not, prepare for another 5-10 clicks. Alarms may not be an important feature to you (or to me really), but you can expect a continuation of this maddening user experience in all other areas. I don't have a single nice thing to say about the software."
1,Worst Phone EVER!,"I bought this phone thinking it would be a big step up from my Motorola V360 but I was very wrong. The phone is so delayed whenever you push a button and it takes about 5 seconds just to think about what its doing. Also, very poor craftmanship on this phone. I had it for a week b4 it cracked and the sad thing is, I never dropped it or anything. Just cracked when it was sitting in my cell phone holder in my car... What's up with that? So now I just paid $300 for this phone and I have to wait until I can scrounge up the $70 deductible to get a new phone from tmobile. Take my advice... Don't get this phone and if you do decide to, make sure you get phone insurance... It's been 2 weeks and I'm already using mine!"
5,Nice cellphone,This is a nice cellphone. I got it from a local cellphone shop. Free and only 1 year contract. Eventually prices will be free like the motorola Razor V3. Small phone and I like the mp3 player mode :)
1,Not happy with Wirefly,"I don't even know what I think about the actual phone yet, it might be awesome who knows--I ordered it 4 days ago saying that it was in stock, requested expedited shipping and all I got was a confusing e-mail back telling me that they were NOT in stock and asked me to wait 48-72 hours for them to receive more stock. I am still waiting, and have not even heard if they have gotten the phone in when I should have received the phone one or two days ago. BAD SERVICE. It is extremely frustrating, and I do not recommend this company because they are disorganized and do not have good customer service."
3,No instructions,"As others have said this does not come with instructions, but a bit of google searching and the other comments helped make this work for a spray job using Behr external paint."
1,Tool Force A-C3 High Pressure Spray Gun,L LINED CONTAINER AND BEATEN came MISSING THE ONLY THING THAT SERIOUS GENTLEMEN came well EMPACAQUETADO WELL PLEASE REVIEW PRODUCT
2,I don't understand,I didn't understand this product at all. it didn't spray and the instructions weren't very useful I attempted to paint the corners but no luck
4,Great Value,"Got this sprayer to do large scale artwork.I've used an airbrush before so it didn't take long to get used to it's operation, although it might take a little time for new users.It sprays a wide range of viscosities.Can't believe it operates this good for the price and I would reccomend it to anyone looking to get smooth finishes otherwise not possible."
2,Soles fall off...,"I had this product for about 1 year with mild use (seriously, I would use them to walk around in a couple times a week and ran in three 5Ks with them... The sole started falling off of both sandals after just 2 months. I used shoe goo twice to repair them. After only one year the sole completely came off the front part of the right sandal.I decided to spend a little more money on some Teva sandals as a replacement. It is worth the money for better quality."
4,Track list,"[Update - thanks for adding a track list, Amazon!] Wondering what songs are on this CD? I was, so I went and found out. I haven't actually listened to it yet so my rating is based upon the song selection only. There are a few unfamiliar tunes, but where else can you find ""Love Missile F1-11?""Cars - Numan, GaryOne Way or Another - BlondieManic Monday - BanglesLove Missile F1-11 - Sigue Sigue SputnikBlood and Roses - SmithereensEighties - Killing JokeSex Crime - EurythmicsTake On Me - a-haEverybody Wants to Rule the World - Tears For FearsInstitutionalized - Suicidal TendenciesMandinka - O'Connor, SineadAll She Wants Is - Duran DuranSafety Dance - Men Without HatsOur House - MadnessRunning Up That Hill - Bush, KatePictures Of Matchstick Men - Camper Van Beethoven"
3,Nice songs,"Love the songs in this movie. Had heard it many times at various events. So, bought it. However, the story line is the same old. So, if you can rent it, don't buy.."
4,A terrific sampler of A Cappella's finest,"Primarily A Cappella is a label devoted-surprise-to a cappella choral singing: vocal jazz, barbershop, national contest winners and local quartets alike. This CD is the label's second sampler designed to display the range of their offerings in holiday arrangements (their first, ""A Cappella Christmas Party,"" is perhaps even better-but just a touch). The result is a wide-ranging, entertaining, thoroughly professional enterprise. Choral superstars like the Swingle Singers and Chanticleer (singing ""Tomorrow Shall Be My Dancing Day,"" not ""In Dulci Jubilo"" as listed on the CD) mix with the lesser-known but superb likes of First Call and the Blenders as well as popular classics such as the Persuasions and wonderful groups you've never heard of. Highlights include M-Pact's syncopated ""Caroling, Caroling,"" the Edlos's haunting ""Sim Shalom,"" the Accidentals's hilarious ""Rudiana,"" and Go Fish's doo-wop ""Away in a Manger,"" but every cut has something to recommend it."
5,"Great price, good quality",This bleach is the same I get from my dentist but 25% of the price. I like the smaller tip that allows you tom put the bleach exactly where you need it in the tray.
3,Overall I was pleased.,I can definitely tell that my teeth have gotten whiter. I do not recommend sleeping with it on because it can cause your gums to be very red.
3,simply sweet,"If your looking for an intense love story, this is not one. But its a simple sweet love story between Lady Cassie, who is sweet, but a little too prim...and Reggie, a really nice guy w/ a fake bad rep. Both are looking for love...Reggie is always falling ""in love"" but its never returned. Cassie is looking for a ""too perfect"" mate. As opposites, they come together, as he tries to woo her. I laughed out loud at parts. He won't declare his love for her till she does, because he'll be hurt more than ever before. Just a nice little romance."
1,couldn't finish it,"I always finish a book no matter how slow or bad it is, hoping that somehow it would redeem itself. This book was so slow and the story line was so lame, I could not make myself care if they got together or not. I was surprised since I liked the previous story of Delia, her twin, sister alot. This seemed like a completely different author. There was no action or struggle in the love relationship. There was a dumb bet and two people liking each other but not admitting it. This could have been a short story in a multi-author book. I will try some others in the Effington family Saga."
1,"Almost embarrassing to read! (Forget the ""almost"")","This book was so silly it was sophomoric. It was as if all the characters were in junior high and life is just a game. (As a matter of fact, they came out and said something to that effect several times.) The ""boys"" were on one team, the ""girls"" on the other. They did something stupid then went off into a huddle (by gender), giggled and plotted, and went off to do some other stupid thing--over and over. The whole book is a collection of short, insignificant, and implausible scenes in which shallow and inmature people talk nonsense in short sentences. Why did I finish it? It was a long flight and this was all I had!"
2,This realy hurts!!!!,"The authors' previous books have been really good. This one made me want to slap someone. I had to force myself to finish the book. The first half of the book was pretty good then it went down hill. I guess I was just frustrated. This author is one of my favorites, maybe she should slow down and develop her characters this one just fell flat on its face."
2,The worst of the The Effington Series.,'The Pursuit of Marriage' by Victoria Alexander is not my favorite of the Effington series. This was the story of Cassie Effington the twin sister of Delia from `The Lady on Question' novel. Cassie and Reggie (Lord Berkley) make a wager that they can find each other perfect match. This book has some great moments but over all it was very boring. I would skip this novel and just know they get together - it has no importance in the series.
2,So sorry Victoria.......,"Well, let's just say I felt like the author felt 'obligated' to pen Cassie's story... it really did not seem as though it ever really got a real story going. The fact is that the book has LOTS of potental. Where did it go? I really don't understand why this book failed. But, it does. I loved her other books & will continue to read them. This one is just a true ""let-down"". Worth the time? maybe just to feel like you've completed the tales. Otherwise, if it's your 1st time reading her novels... don't start here..."
3,Slow,"This book is a very slow and sometimes tedious read, because the characters are rather implausible and their actions are inconsistent. That said, there is some good and humorous dialogue in this novel; the reader just has to wade through quite a bit to get to it."
2,BIG Disappointment!!,"I had read a few of Alexander's books before and found them to be delightful, yet this one makes me wish I had not wasted my money. It was dreadfully slow; I kept reading to see if the pace picked up, but it never did. Also, there was so much repetition. Lastly, the ending was much too easy. There was no grand declaration of love or anything like that, just a simple admittance at the end."
1,Angry because I wasted money.,I'm a fledgling hunter that lives in Wisconsin. As such I was excited to come across this book here at Amazon. Unfortunately the book description claims 'The book delivers everything there is to know about bird hunting in Wisconsin'. This is disgustingly untrue. Everything in this book is either generic ('Geese have dark meat') or is available on the web and in a DNR publication. Have the authors ever hunted in Wisconsin? Have they held a gun? After searching the book I cannot say. This book could have been compiled from anywhere by anyone with an internet connection. Oh wait that is not fair. One might also need a phone to get a current list of Waterfowl Production Areas.As for the 'detailed maps' of public hunting areas - they are the PDF files from the DNR website.Their is no excuse for a rip-off like this one. Why do I have to give it one star? I'd try to sell it used but I have a conscience.
5,yes,"The review of this book in the New York Times referred to it as a ""great man's doodles."" I guess that's about right. It's a hodge-podge of photos, short fiction, commentary on art and music, and a story about a cat named Theodor W. Adorno. Cortazar's other books are referenced frequently, so it helps to be a fan.For me the short story ""No, no, no"" alone is worth the purchase price (whatever it is). It's like a David Lynch movie compressed into one paragraph that features a showdown between two people who are obsessed with ants. Trust me, it's better than it sounds. Cortazar's writing will also make you curious to try yerba mate, which is worse than it sounds.I've been reading this book for about 10 years, and when I'm finished I'll probably start again from the beginning."
1,Completely useless.,This product is so cheap and poorly designed that it broke before it could be used even once. Don't even waste you time on this.
2,Great Cover. But...,"Saw this book on in a friends library and picked it up because it was so attractive. I've always thought i should read shakespeare, so i tried browsing in it. Not much fun. So i came to amazon to look for reviews. Now i see what the problem was.Sure it seems awesome to have such a polished looking volume on the coffee table, but i'm starting with the Oxford student edition of a couple plays and finally starting to GET shakespeare! This one is too expensive a centerpiece for my table if i'm never going to feel able to understand it!"
1,I love Shakespeare... but this edition?,This is NOT where you want to spend your money. There are many good editions. Try Arden or Oxford. This one is NO help. Believe the negative reviews.
5,Fine place to start learning about land management,"I have owned this DVD for about 2 years and have consulted it to learn about pruning trees and other aspects of land management. It is quite applicable to homeowners with a small piece of land, as well as to those who own acreage. Anyone with a tree in the yard and bushes at the perimeter can profit by purchasing Demystifying Woods. The clarity is great! Best of all, the techniques are demonstrated thoroughly. I recommend it highly."
3,Class Review,"I had to buy this book for a class. Though the information and ideas were good, I felt the book was rather academic when the point of it is to bring the Bible back into the church and out of academia."
2,More of the same,"While I did not completely agree wit Spong's book, which is a major reason I picked this book up, I found many interesting things in his ideas. Reclaiming the Bible for the Church reeks of ""everything that guy just said is wrong"" with little critical insight. The remainder of the book is 20 years of Sunday school with the line carefully toed by the authors (plural... this is more of a compilation . It provides little of interest or unique to anyone who has been a regular church attender. That said, it is not badly written and flows pretty well in spite of the the different styles of writing from the different authors. If you like reruns then this may be the book for you. Frankly it is vastly overpriced for opinions you can find free on the web (even if less well written)."
3,Extremely interesting if too tightly focused,"While I think that those that gave this book a negative review for being too narrow in scope and being very bogged down by excessive stats have a point but I believe this book is a noble undertaking and does prove its thesis which is that most French weren't in the Resistance, many French profited handsomely by the German presence and most Germans loved France and didn't want to spoil what was for them an idyllic place. Also, the author turns over alot of stones that most French probably wish were left alone like: the complicity of the Catholic Church, the alacrity with which the Surete turned over Jews especially foreign ones, and the total collaborationist behavior of many,many prominent people in the government."
5,Gorgeous book!,"A great look at French graphic design, with special emphasis on influential movements such as constructivism, dadaism and surrealism. Russian, Swiss and German design have all played crucial roles in the story of French graphic design and are not neglected in this book. The survey has fantastic examples from every era since the invention of movable type, right up until today."
5,Fun Times Without Even Tryin',"This album shouldn't really be analyzed too much because it would trivialize the carefree enjoyment I've had listening this album with my cool pals. The music is somewhat ""Strokie"" but it's less dramatic, less grrly, less contrived, guitars jangle with inspiration, the message is less serious, and honestly these guys are cool genuine rockers who don't ""try to impress"" nor do they come off looking like a 'Boyz-Band' like The Strokes. Another thing that makes this band unique, there's a black guy in the band...it's about time that indie rock music open up to miniorties."
4,Another Nice Debut,"In the same genre of the Hives, Vines, Strokes etc, comes a new disc with a bit of Brit swagger mixed in. You can hear the Jones/Strummer influence on quite a few tracks which are the cd's highlights. A couple of filler tracks keeps the disc from 5 stars."
4,Worth the cash,"I only heard this album once maybe twice through before seeing them live. I'm a big fan of the Strokes and although you may be able to compare them a lil, the Libertines definitely have their own style. The disc has its ups and downs, but all the songs are very catchy. Definitely worth every penny spent!"
4,libertines review,i give this album 4 stars..its best listen to when you are drinking or getting hi...its one of the best out of a few punk rock albums that has come out since the 70s and 80s.i do recommend it and i really like the song radioamerica..i think the songs are gentle even though they are performed with a kick...i think they are a fun band and the make me happy and i like their look...they dont have mohawks with piercings all over them like all this new crud like good charlet and so on..they are true punk and its usualy the uk to do it for you..enjoy this album mate !
3,"3.5 Stars, Nice Listen...","A bit o' Kinks, Clash, and Costello. Not much new here at all, but it is still a fun album to listen to. This is a definite tribute to Joe Strummer and the Clash's influence all these years later. In fact, there are times when the two sounds are indistinguishable. I am not one to knock a band for deriving their sound from other bands, most would find it necessary. Unfortunately, the Libertines aren't bringing anything new to compliment their borrowed sounds, so the album is but an echoing of past brilliance. If you are looking for a new sound, this isn't it, but nevertheless it is still good for a listen..."
3,Monkees in Overdrive,"This record sounds like the Monkees playing as fast as they can at blow-the-speakers decibels. And that's a pretty good thing. It means the tunes are almost all catchy and the vibe is upbeat and infectious. It also means that these guys aren't going to save rock'n'roll from the inevitability of endless recycling. Face it, rock is a late period art form. The fresh ideas aren't there any more. It survives only because unlike, say, big band swing music, it's so darn easy to play rock with your mates. No huge investment or massive amount of people needed. The Libertines are fun -- but they ain't no Elvis, Beatles, Stones, Ramones or Pistols. Those days are gone."
1,Yawn...,"Having grown up in London in the 70s and 80s, I actually saw the Jam, the Buzzcocks,and a host of other like bands so it is hard for me to appreciate this album; it is derivative to the point of plagarism. If you want to hear this sound, go back to the origionals plus when Paul Weller was in the Jam, he was never an uber-tosser like Pete (of course, even Weller succumbed to the inner-wanker when he formed the Style Council but I suppose one should forgive him for that.)"
3,up the bracket,i haven't heard the whole album so i don't want to have to grade it but i heard the song up the bracket and it sounds almost exactly like i don't wanna grow up by the ramones
2,Smells like something I've heard before,The strokes white stripes etc. etc. Another overhyped band the libertines. Mine is already being used as a coaster. Seriously there are about two good songs and Mick jones production is so so. In the early new wave punk days the bands and production sounded ameture because they were. The energy level however was real. Now it seems cool to sound like you don't know what you are doing and the energy is forced. I don't buy it.( well I did but no more)
2,"Just like the Clash, Overrated","Just like The Clash, these guys are overrated. It is nauseating the way the British press has propagated the junkie chic myth of Pete Doherty. However, none of that would matter if this were an album of stronger music. There's a lot of energy and some hooks on this record. At the end of several listens, though, it all seems boringly mediocre."
5,The best album of the year,"This album was the definetely the best album i have heard in a while, and is the ultimate joy ride for music enthusiasts. I think that this might be the first time that I have cracked a smile when listening to music in a long time. There's not a single weak track on this album (save ""What a Waster"" which sways from the style of the rest of the album to be more pop-ish), but here are my faves:1. I Get Along--there's a reason that they made an ep with this song as its title.2. Boys in the Band3. Begging--The crescendo at the intro will have you strumming your air guitar by the songs end"
5,Lovely,"This group, like almost any new band that comes out now, has been compared to the Clash, the Buzzcocks, the Ramones, etc. Unfortunately, that is the consequence of living in an age where the media is highly concious of itself and of the way history is made. The best thing to do when listening to this cd is to forget these comparisons and listen to the Libertines on their own, as they are. They have the spunk and rawness of old school punk, but the poetry in their music shapes them into a different type of band altogether. They are lovely and idealistic on ""Radio America"" and drunk and messy on ""I Get Along"" but there is absolutely real feeling no matter what they are trying to say.They are one of the best new bands around and are stunning enough to be allowed to leave those comparisons behind and start fresh, as themselves. Buy this cd if you are fan of good music in any form."
3,Bracket mostly upped,3 1/2Retaining much raucousness (which even in a few years equates to a lot in the indie rock world) the sloppily charming lads work a nice range of post-punk assuring the debut would become the toast of town.
1,Doesn't even work half the time,It is all in the title. The first time I tried to use the slim keyboard it wouldn't work. I tried a number of time here and there but never could get it to do anything when I typed on the keys. I tired it again a few months later and the miracle is that the keyboad worked. Then I recharged my ipaq and tried the slim keyboard again and again it didn't work. I have tried a number of thing thinking it was perhaps me who was stupid. Turns out it is the key board that is stupid. Go figure. Well HP looks as if you have done it again.
4,Incredible idea!,"My son has slept in his cosleeper from the day he came home from the hospital. It's great because i dont have to get up from bed when he wakes up but he still has the independence of being in his own little bed. It's level with the bed, doesnt take up too much space and is very easy to assemble. It's also better than a bassinet because it carries more weight (24 vs 15 lbs) so he can use it longer. My one gripe is that the blue dot pattern is actually a sky blue rather than the deep blue shown in the picture. i returned it and swapped it out for the tan dot."
1,"Not a good reference book on the subject, unfortunately","Just a brief note of my own to agree with one reviewer in mentioning that one is disappointed with the content matter of this book which begs to be edited properly and could be a bit more descriptive in regards to Japanese armor in general. There is a market for a well-put together book treating this subject as the number of collectors of ""samurai art"" grows every year, not just armor, but parts of armor such as masks, cuirasses, helmets, and we could use more information re. the different schools of armorers, methods used in making armor, terminology, etc. Maybe someday we shall see such a book in the English language (because in Japanese there are many)."
4,"Helpful, especially for smaller churches","This book address an important issue for all churches, but especially for smaller churches: how can worship be revitalized to attract new members without losing the elements that are important to longj-standing members. Most books on contemporary worship seem to have a started from scratch approach, i.e., start a new service or totally change the existing service. That is not very workable in most situations. However, these authors suggest a blended approach that I have found to be most effective in my church of 50-75 attenders. Their idea that ""contemporary"" is not ""new"" but instead ""a recovery of what is best in the worship of all ages"" (page 7). I highly recommend this book to anyone in church leadership struggling with how to make changes that will not shut down the church!"
1,wrong shirt sent,"I ordered the blue superman shirt, however the black shirt was mailed. I wrote back to the seller with no response. I was not happy because this was to be a Christmas gift and was not able to give the correct shirt. I will never order from this site again!"
1,Extremely disturbing...,"While one should appreciate the well-crafted presentation of Mr. Kilpatrick's work and the excellent quality of the photographic reproductions of the subjects, the overall lasting impression is so horrific that I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Surely there must be many other photographic essays that allow the viewer to wax nostalgic over the impressive vehicles of the 40's & 50's. But to bear witness to the gruesome endings that the subjects in this book met with is extremely disturbing. Just in case the reader hasn't had enough after viewing a glimpse of pre-seat-belt days, there are some murders and suicides thrown in. No one but the professionals who had to investigate these scenes should have ever seen these photographs."
1,"Sick, sick sick...","whats the matter with people? You can get enough of this on the news or in your personal life, but someone trying to make money off of someone else's tradgedy, is really too much.. If the is the best she can do, maybe it's time to find another line of work."
4,Show it to your teenagers.,"Before my stepdaughter went off to her first driving class, I showed her this book. I think it made an impression. Makes you think about the responsibilty and risks you assume when you get behind the wheel."
3,"Interesting, but nothing extremely entertaining.","It was interesting to look at the photos in this book. However it wasn't as good as many of the other photo books out there that a person could buy. I would recommend that a person go to the bookstore and look at it while there. That way you could look at a book that is interesting, but not good enough to buy.I'll give it a straight down the middle 3 stars. Some people will think less, others more."
5,"A Simple, Clear and Unpretentious Approach to Meditation","This book provides a simple, non-denominational approach to meditation, that is free of gurus and affectation. Strand, a former Zen Buddhist monk, left monastery life behind for this simple approach to meditation. It's as simple and unaffected as a plain"" wooden bowl"". Just sit and be present, where we always are anyway. There is no fancy instruction aside from counting the breath from one to four. He advocates the formation of non-hierarchical ""present moment groups"" to support the practice. This is a perfect and easy to follow primer who those interested in getting started meditating."
3,Not for beginners,"I would emphasize what one of the other reviewer's stated. This is a very interesting account of one man's path to meditation, but you really have to read it carefully. It is not a prescription for beginners. At about the third chapter it occurred to me that the author was not talking so much about meditation but his own struggle to cope with extreme depression."
5,"An Excellent ""Guide""","A sincere, for real people, everyday, guide to meditation, without any rigidity. Clark Strand honestly shares his experiences with meditation and gives very valuable advice on how include mindfulness in everyday life."
2,Elvira is cut short!!!!!!!!!!,"The very end of the song where Richard hits the ""bottom of the barrel"" with his amazing vocal chords...is totally cut out! What a scam! I used to listen to this song as a kid and I feel I've been betrayed!!"
2,cd,couldn't preview this cd!! i couldn't even see the songs on it for some reason. was disappoiinted; i wanted their gospel songs.
5,Awesome,"My parents listen to these good old boys and I grew up listening to them and my children are now listening to them. I went to a concert at the Ross Ragland in Klamath Falls,Or and I loved the bass he is so low you can feel it in your seat. All are cute too! Great albums"
1,"""C"" Earrings!","Cloe has ""C"" earrings! That's awe-somme! You shoud make the reg. bratz doll have initial earrings. IN fact, i think you should make ALL bratz w/ earrings without increasing the price!But anyways, Cloes outfit is very trendy and has a very clear & healthy face w/ pretty , light make-up.The nly thing I have a problem with is her hat! I mean it looks like a clown wig! But other than that, it's sooo cool.A nice one to add to your collection. The best one since Yasmin's! But I do reccomend that you donot open it because it's bigger than your head and you couldn't play wit it!PLEASE AMAZON! PUT ME ON YOUR SPOTLIGHT REVIEWS!THANK U & GOD BLESS!Love,Baby Girl (:"
3,A bit of a slow read,"It took a few hundred pages to get accustomed to the writting style and figuring out that a space between paragraphs meant that you are now on another indirectly related story that may or may not be related to the part you just read. Also, it was a little hard to follow some of the characters that would alternate between first name/last name/nickname through out the book almost every other sentance."
2,Boring and Trite,"I believe most of Clancy's works are unoriginal and somewhat boring, but Clear and Present Danger was personally offensive to me as a woman. The only female character is protrayed as unintelligent and permiscuous. She was the one who gave away the top secret plans, and went about it in a very tacky way: during an afair with someone who used her for her information. This was rather hard for me to look past. Plus i did not enjoy Clancy's monotonous rambling anout insignificant items such as how powerful a rifle is, or how large a ship is. To me it was simply uninteresting, and I usually enjoy descripvtive novels."
1,The Worst Book I have ever read,This is the worst book ever. It is about 700 pages long and could be 150.There are too many stories. It owuld be better if it was just about the soldiers in the jungles of colombia.Clancy tells you everyones life story and there grandmothers life story.The only good thing about this book is that Clancy is good on what makes America good as a country.
1,Don't like aspect,It's bad to wage war on drug dealers in South America?!?!?!?!?I wish Tom Clancy would do us all a big favor and keep his silly Libertarian views to himself.
1,Don't Even Waste your time with this book!,"Clear And Present Danger is OK at points, but the rest of the novel is boring with the CIA work, the action between the Commandos don't feel realistic, the story drags on on for hundreds of pages, the boring details of how big a ship is, that is boring! If you want to read a REAL and exciting novel, read Bob Mayer's Eyes Of The Hammer. Bib Mayer is a former Special Forces officer, the action is there, and is VERY EXCITING unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action."
1,Not a page-turner by any standards,"A tremendously long and boring account of the war against drugs. But Mr. Clancy seems to be too intent on explaining his 15-page histories of the characters and even of the firearms used by them that he sometimes seems to forget about the plot.In fact, in the synopsis at the back of my version of the book, it says that the cartel has pushed too far by assaninating the Director of the FBI and the Colombian Ambassador to the USA. But When do they get assasinated? in the first 50 pages? Think again. On the 313th page!! So it certainly didnt keep me on the edge of MY seat.The movie was brilliant, though. Maybe Mr. Clancy should take a few tips from it."
2,This book needs an editor.,"If I had to describe this book with one word it would be long. This book goes on forever. It wouldn't be so bad if it were interesting, but long stretches of this book are very dry and boring. It takes several hundred pages to set up the story, and much of this is wasted on extensively describing characters and subplots that have very little to do with the main story.When the main part of the story is going, it goes very well. There is intrigue, suspense, exciting gunplay, and surprises that are typical of Clancy novels. But there is so much in between that the book as a whole drags.In addition, the discussions about the rape early in the book and the foul language did nothing to contribute to the story, and in fact detracted greatly from it."
1,Too much detail.,"I waded through the first 150 or so pages and got lost in the detailed descriptions of the characters. Detail is fine but less is better. Clancy's ""The Hunt for the Red October"" was better."
1,Relentlessly bad,"The impressive thing about ""Clear and Present Danger,"" as with Mr. Clancy's other books, is how long it is - page after page of horrendous, addled English. After reading the whole book (I was laid up with the flu and couldn't reach anything else), I felt as though I'd been beaten; the thing utterly wrecked me. It's not just that it's badly written; it so lovingly dwells on the most tiresome details of guns and violence that, by the end, one begins to fear for Mr. Clancy's mental health. Not that he's difficult to diagnose; his disappointment at never being an army commado, displaced into a military fetish, screams from every paragraph - but the reader must wonder, will this man *snap*? Given that danger, I suppose we must permit him to keep writing these vast pathologies; but, Lord, why must we allow him to publish"
1,"Terrible, awful, lousy.","As usual, this is pure Clancy crap: cardboard characters. egomaniacal wet-dream rantings of an adolescent idiot."
1,THIS IS AMERICAN CULTURAL MANURE AT ITS WORST!,"Of all the awful books I have read, this one has got to be the worst. Mindless American patriotism (something that makes me want to puke) and a stunning inability to write leads the reader through this book, coupled with dreadfully long and totally uninteresting character descriptions of stereotypical personalities. Clancy's obession with technical names of various weaponry slow the book to a halt. The thought processes of various characters are so immature and idiotic that I was left wondering what kind of imbecile could write manure like this. Stay away from this book, and furthermore, stay away from everything this Tom Clancy writes. Only gullible Americans could possibly swallow literature like this, as the other reviews demonstrate."
4,One of Clancy's Best,"Tom Clancy wrote Clear and Present Danger with a good taste of military excitement along with the overtalk of politics. All in all, ""Clear and Present Danger"" Is a well-written book with TOO MUCH POLITICS involved. Infantry Strike scenes were well written however and the movie was every bit as good as the book. Clear and Present Danger is based on a Special Ops Light Infantry fighting a Drug Cartel in Columbia, But when Jack Ryan finds the truth about the opeations, He must get the infantry exracted before it is too late."
4,"OK, but not as realistic as most readers think.","I've worked in special operations for two decades and this book is obviously written by someone from the outside looking in. It's a good book, but please don't think it's reality. You want a book about the same subject matter that is closer to what has really gone on, I recommend Bob Mayer's EYES OF THE HAMMER. Mayer is a former Green Beret who knows what he's talking about."
5,"Very Good, Very Realistic, Very Coincidental?","This was the best Clancy book that I have read yet, in fact one of the best books that I've read period. After reading a few of Clancy's Op-Center books, I was beginning to lose confidence in him (formerly one of my favorite authors). This book certainly reminds me of what Clancy is capable of. As a little added bonus, I just happened to finish the book just hours before it was announced that the US attacked the terrorists targets in Afghanistan and Sudan in real life! Freaky!"
3,"Excuse me, but? Good fiction and remember that it is.","This is fun read. But it isn't reality. Clancy can weave many storylines together and most of his technical stuff is right on the money. So far so good. But he doesn't have a clue what it's like to be one of the guys on the ground. Like the military would put together a team of single, infantry guys to run these ops? Why do they have Spec-ops? Delta? Duh? Oh well. You want the same story told in a more realistic manner? Check out Eyes of The Hammer. By a former green beret who knows whereof he writes."
2,Unclear and past belief,"Disappointing - the main plot is quite good, but Clancy's subplots slow things down and get in the way (especially the Coast Guard scenes) and are unbelievable. The techno parts which give this and and his other books their uniqueness, also cause things to slow down. Also I don't know if I had a defective binding, but several scenes were repeated in my copy. Better editing would have vastly improved this work."
3,"The U.S. gets serious in the ""war on drugs""","The Coast Guard intercepts a luxury yacht where a brutal murder of 4 U.S. citizens has occurred. The two Columbians aboard are coerced into confessing to the murder, and the gov't ends up with critical information regarding the drug trade. With this information and the decision from the President that illegal drugs represent a ""clear and present danger"" several operations are launched to hit the Columbian cartel where it hurts. Between financial seizures in the hundreds of millions and surgical strikes on supply lines, the action stays fast-paced and interesting.While not my favorite Clancy book, it was nevertheless fun to read right down to the intense end. Also, the progression of Jack Ryan's career with the CIA and the addition of John Clark (a minor charcter in ""Cardinal of the Kremlin""), adds to the human element of the story. The action is great, and although the language is at times pretty coarse, I enjoyed reading it."
4,An excellent story,"Clancy describes in intimate detail the life and challenges faced by special forces. This story is a little different then some of his others. It features Jack Ryan, but he is only one of the major characters instead of the main one. There is a lot of emphasis put on the perspective of the special forces units, especially behind enemy lines. The movie DID NOT capture the intense feeling of being both predator and prey that the soldiers experienced. Its cliche, but the book ruined the movie for me. If you liked the movie at all you will love the book."
5,"Excellent book, action and suspense","This book is so good. The action is exciting, and you are always on the edge of your seat wondering how the battle is going to end. Also, Clancy is obviously anti-drug, with both this book and Without Remorse. Buy this book, it is a must-have Clancy, without a doubt."
4,clear and present danger,"I really enjoyed this book. I especially like books with Chavez or Clark in it. If you love good action and a great book, read this. Chavez is mainly in this the most. I love his character and his expert shot. A great book."
3,Great Story with some fluff,"Clear and Present Danger is your prototypical Tom Clancy Jack Ryan novel. This one gets a sort of slow start and contains a lot of extra stuff that seemed unnecessary. The book was really longer than it needed to be an lost my attention in some spots. Minus that, the story and basic plot is one of the best around. The movie, as usual, completely butchered the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't mind a long read"
2,Dull.....,"I guess I'm not a great fan of Clancy. I loved Red Storm Rising though, because of it's abundance of military knowledge, action, suspense and plot. I mean that is a book that has a huge amount of content and justifies being 1000 pages long. But all of his other books, including CAPD are 250 page novels expanded with boring tedious detail. Someone should go to his books cut out all the needless blurb and release it. I would buy it as it's clear there is a good plot at work, but following it is like reading through treacle."
3,"Not Clancy's best, but still good","This is a good book, but focuses a little to much on details. The first several hundred pages are difficult to follow, but after that the book really picks up. The ending is tremendous and unpredictable. All in all, this book has a strong storyline, but gets muddled in all the extraneous detail."
2,Missing parts,"The paint gun is a great product for the price. It has worked well for thinner paints, however they did not include the 2.0M needle for spraying latex paint and this is why I purchased the gun."
3,Missing parts.,"Received the item very quickly and well packaged. While checking the contents I discovered some parts referred to in the manual were missing: 2nd filter, hex nut, 4 connectors, and seals to fit between paint cup and paint gun. The parts that did arrive look well made and based on other reviews I expect the paint gun will work well. I will post an update after I have tried the paint gun on a project.If anyone else has had this experience I would like to know the following: where can I get replacement filters, and are the paint cup seals necessary and if so where can I get them? The hex nut and connectors seem to be for the air connection, but I will be using a quick connect connector instead.I did find a very similar product on line at Menard's made by a company called Tool Shop."
1,missing parts,This item was shipped with parts missing.There was no information that I could find on how to order or obtain the missing parts.
1,Not professional quality!!!!,"I would not recommend this gun if you are planning to paint a car part. The quality of this gun is poor. Save some extra money and buy a HVLP gun from Lowe's or Home Depot. If you are professional painter, look elsewhere."
4,Very good buy for the price,"At under $50 I'm satisfied. It works as I think an HVLP gun should work (although i admit I've never owned one before). Once you get the viscosity of the paint right, and the spray adjusted, the gun does what it's supposed to do. The paint hopper works well, and the internal parts seem durable and fit properly.The only ""cheapy"" looking piece I can point to is the air regulator. It's the piece I see failing first (I actually thought it failed once already, but was just.. malfunctioning?) You need to pull out the plastic knob to unlock it, twist it around to get the setting right, and then push back in to lock it (at least I think, it could be reversed.. anyways you get the idea). Also, the wire brush included is crap that won't last long.You get what you pay for, but for the price, even if the regulator breaks, I'll still be happy for a while just using the regulator on my tank."
4,Great tool,"I've been using this sprayer over the past month to spray varnish onto wood-strip canoes. After dialing in a bit too much flow the first time and getting a few drips, I cut back on the amount of varnish and set the pressure dial to about 35 whatevers, and I've gotten coat after coat of smooth and quick layers. I love this thing! I'm running it off a 6 gallon Porter Cable pancake compressor, and it works fine as long as I pause when the pressure drops too low. Repeated cleanups have been pretty quick and easy, too, with only one clog when I didn't get enough varnish/thinner out of the front spray holes. Great price for a great product!"
4,Amazing value,"First, this product is an amazing value. The quality of the spray is very good. Latex paint comes out in a nice even and fine pattern. But you have to accept that the pressure gauge is completely useless. It fell apart and I tossed it. I painted a door with it and the quality was impressive. Highly recommended, look no further."
5,SPRAY GUN,"I AM QUITE SATISFIED WITH THIS GUN. IT WORKS GREAT AND DOES A QUALITY JOB. THIS WAS MY FIRST SPRAY GUN,SO I WAS SOMEWHAT SCEPTICAL. I AM NOW SATISFIED AFTER USING IT."
3,Missing Parts,"Hex, Nut and connector are missing This should not impact me but beware this seems to happen a lot with this product"
1,Really Bad Kindle Format,"The book itself is fine but the conversion to Kindle format is really bad. The font must be ""Bold Fuzzy misaligned"", it's hard to read. Also this is the only Kindle book that I have that greatly impacts the Kindle performance. It takes a full 60 sec. to come out of sleep mode and the pages turn noticeably slower. I don't know who did the conversion to this format but get samples first and don't purchases books like this."
4,4 1/2,"See storyline above.Though he's brought in a new protagonist, Coonts still offers up the intensity and suspense you're accustomed to. The storyline and the pace move along at a speed that will keep you more than satisfied. Jake Grafton plays a pivotal role in the novel, yet he's more of a sideliner (An important one though). A satifying thriller that Coonts fans will enjoy.Highly recommended."
1,Terrible book for this series,"I have to say that I have never seen a novel as poorly written as this one. The editing and proofreading were horrible. I think that Coontz or his editor used search and replace functions incorrectly, because the story couldn't flow. Sentences which continually mention a character's first and last name are tedious, almost to the point that it feels that they were used to hit a word count. I read a large number of books in this genre, and this is by far the worst I've read in a long time."
5,Coonts brings back Grafton and Carmellini,Liars and Thieves is a wonderful book because the popular characters of Grafton and Carmellini are back. The fact that Carmellini works for the CIA undercover in America is unusual because the CIA is not officially allowed to carry out Clandestine operations in America. I would have had the FBI as the good heroes in this book. The conversation between Grafton and Carmellini is great. It makes sense that a retired Admiral like Grafton might have some friends in Western Intelligence. I would not have made a wife of an American President look bad but thats fiction novels.
1,Liars and Thieves,"I ordered the book for my son, Justin Walters, who is in prison and he was sent the CD of the book and has no way of returning it so I am very upset and disappointed. I tried to contact you directly but was only put in circles at your website. Please send him the book and I will use your service over and over again. Please write me back on your decision.Thank you,Paula Walters"
1,Adolescent dreck,"Coonts' excessive macho posturing is unbearable in this misogynist, dreadful cartoon of a novel. Tommy the CIA burglar, the supposed hero in this simplistic, childish scumburger of a book, has no use for ""broads"" or ""ditzes."" They do what he wants or he ""pops"" them without reservation or shame. Most of this book is about him belittling, abusing and controlling helpless passive women, who of course find him dashing and romantic. There's some action movie plot involving the FBI or the CIA and cell phones that don't work, but I lost interest. It's the kind of stuff that Ludlum and Clancy do much better. If you like your women docile and afraid to stand up for themselves, this is the book for you. If you've evolved beyond hitting women because you think it makes you tough, you'll find this dreck as obnoxious as I do."
2,Passable thriller,"This is a passable thriller that should hold your attention enough to keep you awake on long drives. It includes scenes of torture, sexual situations, and vulgar language that are not appropriate for younger readers or listeners. Guerin Barry is superb with male voices, but not with female voices. This is not a story with any deeper themes--the protagonist doesn't really grow as a character--he merely survives. People who like realistic political thrillers may also be disappointed. But if you need something for the road, this may do nicely."
2,Boring and not well edited,"This novel is episodic and sometimes rambling, with little character development (except perhaps Willie and Sarah). Starting about half way through, the story becomes confusing from time to time when the author confuses characters (he writes ""Dorsey"" when he should have said ""Sarah"", for instance). Where was the editor? The worst case was when the protagonist of the 1st person narrative (Tommy Carmellini) is speaking and says he is driving, then says that Tommy Carmellini (along with other characters) was in the back of the van. Huh?Lots of ""padding"" with travelogues, weather reports, and irrelevant details that go nowhere. Most of the book is a long chase sequence with the body count going up, up, and up.I could have better spent my book dollars elsewhere. I will, next time, by choosing another author."
3,"Good book, but somewhat unrealistic","This book is a good book, especially if you haven't read a lot of realitic military fiction. This book has a character that is a lot like James Bond, the invincible spy. After a while, this character's unrealistic achievements ruin the book. Many of the things don't make sense if you think about them. One of the things that is most incongrous is that a group of soldiers is able to overrun CIA's specially trained guard troops, but then is consistently defeated by a signle agent.Things like this happen throughout the book, and all the while people are dying. It seems that one character is able to handle the world, something that everyone should know isn't true. If you want a book with a lot of shooting action, this is for you. If you want a book with real substance, you's be better off looking somewhere else."
5,A lot of fun,Not too deep. A fun plot many heros lots of action easy to read it will make you smile recommended
4,"Great plot, let down by less than believable characters","I found it very hard to put this book down; the first two thirds of the plot just races along, and it only begins to drag somewhat towards the end, when US federal politics comes to dominate the story. While there is plenty of violence, it isn't overly graphic. Characterisation is patchy, with the women in particular generally being portrayed at a simplistic, adolescent level. Interesting to find that the plot was inspired by the very real defection of a retired KGB archivist!"
1,Tedious and Boring,"The author has gone off the rails with this effort. Poorly written and confusingly told, it was a difficult story to get interested in. I have liked many of his past efforts, but this one seems to have been written by another hand. Raising the bit player, Tommy Camaillini to the forefront of the book, doesn't work and when Jake Grafton enters the picture, his role in things is tepid and in the background. I could not have been more disappointed. Save your money."
1,Just get a King James if you want one.,This book is a complete waste of money. The Interlinear text reads the same as the text from the King James almost exactly. I really for the life of me do not know why this book was even made. Mabye to enforce what the Author already believed. There are bibles that are much better at shedding light on the original meaning of the words used in what became the Bible. I found that John 1:1 was among the most terrible of the passages. It sheds no light on the text but is a reverse of the english already used for the KJV.
3,Not All Stanza's,"Good music, good recordings, just not all the stanzas to the songs. I am happy with the CD, but wish it had more, which is why I only gave it 3 stars."
3,Hymns Incomplete,"Excellent singing and good selection of songs, but the songs are incomplete. I'm still looking for CD with complete hymns."
1,Short Clips Mostly ... A Waste of Time for Hymn Lovers,"Beware that this DVD has too many songs which are single stanza only, and uses arrangements which waste too much time on orchestral embellishments before beginning the hymn.Extremely irritating."
2,Not what I expected.,Choir and music are excellent but only the first verse of each hymn is presented. Very disappointing because if it had been advertised as such I would not have bought it.
2,"Great music, disappointed by incomplete tracks","The music is great. The Hymns are classic in wording and melody which is commendable since the traditional words are becoming harder to find. My regret is that I did not realize the first CD is only short (40 seconds to 2 minutes) excepts of the hymns consisting of a verse or sometimes only the refrain. They are not complete hymns or even the first and last verses. The second CD does contain complete (at least a complete verse or two) pieces, although in my opinion the hymns of the first CD are the ones I most want to hear."
3,Hymns Triumphant 1&2,"It was not exactly what I would have liked. I would have preferred more of a real choir with organ accompaniment, rather than an orchestra. It is makes for nice background/inspirational collection however."
1,Wrong Picture,"Pachmyar makes incredible grips for a variety of guns. However, when researching the grips listed here, I discovered the picture is not of a Browning, but rather a Kimber. The Kimber has two grip screws on each side, the Browning has only one per side. This is not helpful!"
5,Great little set,"I've had these for about 7 years and I find myself reaching for them over and over again. I've got other more expensive paring knives but...I don't care much for the shape of the little curved one so I mainly reserve that for opening bags, boxes and packages. After seven years of nearly daily use one of the others broke so I'm here to get another set. You simply cannot beat the price!"
4,gave as a gift,I gave these knives to my son as a gift. He says he doesn't use the curved one but uses the other all the time and likes them. He gives them 4 stars. I buy from amazon all the time. they never disappoint.
5,Nice,Sharp and every thing I require of a paring knife. The blades are in 3 useful configurations. I tend to grab the pointed one most often.
4,Nice Knives,"For the price I paid, it is a nice set. Better than I thought it would be. I use it mainly for cutting salads and soft fruits and vegetables"
5,Good quality for a reasonable price,Nice knifes for a great price. We've had them for sometime and they have kept their edge. Happy with the purchase.
3,Paring knives,"These knives are a bit flimsy, but get the job done. Not for anything heavy duty, but for light chopping their ok."
1,Really bad quality product,"I bought this product less than a year; it only worked about three months (we didn't use it very often, most on weekend). It totally stopped working starting three months later. Lots of hassle to get the warranty coverage through the manufacturer Power Bright(18662966775). I would rank it as the worst product I ever bought from Amazon."
1,useless chinese junk,"Power Bright VC1500W Voltage Transformer 1500 Watt Step Up/Down 110 Volt - 220 Volt. It was DOA. I looked around and found that fuse cap was missing. Yes it has a fuse holder with a screw type cap. When I looked inside the package I found the cap along with fuse. I tried to put it back in place. That's when I realized there is no thread at all on both sides (cap and the body), no kidding if possible I'll post photos. That shows that this piece of junk was never tested. I know how to fix that but didn't wanted to, because if I open it up and fix it and if there are any other problems then I can't even return it. So decided to return it. Amazon gave me a return shipping label. The only hazzle was to pack it again and drop it at the post office. So do I recommend buying this? definitely not."
5,Step Up/Down Power Transformer,"Very easy to set up and use. Documentation is straight forward. I put this to use right away and it has been problem free, just like the entire process."
3,Buzzes!!!,"I've had this step up/down transformer for about a month now. I run my pioneer 1020 receiver and my canon printer off of this device. It works as advertised and I've had no problems with its power delivery. I would give it more stars, but the buzzing sound the unit makes is extremely annoying."
1,"Got a defective one, the company is ignoring me","I bought this in case I had to use an Italian medical equipment. After 1 year of purchase I open the box because I got pneumonia again and I have to use the medical tool. So I found it's defective, so it does not work. I call and they say send documentation and photo of defect. So I do, but they never replied. My bad I didn't check it immediately but the defect is so evident that it means this thing never was checked when it was assembled... And instead to be sorry they just don't care."
4,Decent product for the capability,Overall highly satisfied with the product and the purchase process. Would recommend buying this item or similar products from this company.
5,Great Buy,This item is perfect for the use of foreign devices that needs 220 volts.It has a On Off button so can be installed and turned on whenever you need. I have checked and no electricity is used in Off mode.The product is great!
4,"very good, I like it very much","I use this for 220V appliance, it works very good. it sounds a little noise when thurn it on. I burnt one fuse when I connect my tea stove which was on at the moment. One question is I do not know if the max output can reach 1500W.very good, I will use it for my foot spa which is purchased in China, also made in China, half the price you can find here in US."
1,Misleading ad and media platform abilities,For me this was a TOTAL waste of money as it cannot play on any other media platform and I don't have the one it needs. The ad was misleading and bordrs on fraud.
4,"Modest, Endearing Book for the Beginner/Elementary Reader","This is a simple but engaging book to help build the confidence of the beginner/elementary reader, who is taken on a search for a missing cat. Only four sentences (Have you seen my cat? / This is not my cat. / Where is my cat? / This is my cat.) are used (only nine words) in the 21 pages of this book, but these sentences are repeated over and over again, so that the book ends up averaging 4-5 words per page."
1,Give it to someone you don't like,"Good kids books can be read over and over and still be enjoyable. This book makes me mental. Like most Eric Carle books, the pictures are neat (though often cringe-worthy. Really? A native South American in a loin cloth squatting by a hut? An Arab in a tent with a camel nearby?). There's only 3 lines in this book, and one is only used once. Have you seen my cat? This is not my cat! Repeat. Repeat. and... Repeat. Obvious effort was put into the pictures. Can't say the same for the words. This book is only good for giving to a parent you know as a punishment."
2,Boring!,"My son has many Eric Carle books and all of them are great. All except this one. There is repetition and then there is no effort or creativity and this book displays very little creativity and/or effort. To sum this book up it is 10 pages of have you seen my cat?, follwed by ""this is not my cat"". Very predictable!!"
5,That's not MY cat -- but it IS my book!,"Ok, so I'm getting closer to 30 than I am to 3, but as a lifetime lover of Eric Carle books and a die-hard cat person, I loved this book. I first encountered it in an undergraduate children's lit. class during my senior year in college. From there, I took the book home to my roommates (two guys and another gal) and it became a permanent resident on the coffee table!It was great to pick up after a long day -- even just to look at Carle's whimsical art work. But, more importantly, the memorable line ""that's not MY cat,"" became the motto of our household. It didn't matter if the subject was a mismatched sock or an extra plate of leftovers in the fridge -- my roommates would jubilantly yell out ""that's not MY cat!""Have You Seen My Cat is a great book for the kid in all of us -- even if you don't have a special child to read to, I highly recommend this book."
4,Repetition builds social language,"This book was recommended to me by a speech therapist to promote social, ""turn taking"" language in my toddler. Others have criticized this book as too repetitious, unfairly I think. For a toddler or pre-schooler developing language, and the social skills that go with it, it is quite appropriate. We have enjoyed the book and benefited from it as well. Highly recommended."
2,Our least favorite of Eric Carle's wonderful collection,"We own several of Eric Carle's illustrated books, and this is our least favorite! Repitition is good for children, but this book goes a little over board. ""Is this my cat? This is not my cat"" is on every page of the book until the end.. the illustrations are great, as usual, but the excitement ends there. If you do not own an Eric Carle book, this one will turn you off to him, and his books are wonderful. Skip this one and choose 'Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see?'(teaches colors and animals), 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar'(teaches days of the week, numbers, and how eating healthy affects how you feel), 'The Very Busy Spider', 'The Very Lonely Firefly', 'The Very Grouchy Ladybug' or any others."
1,Not the Usual Eric Carle,"This book misses the mark. Here's all the words in the book ""Have you seen my cat"", ""this is not my cat"", ""this is my cat"". While I agree repetition is good, the fact that there are no OTHER words to describe the different scenes in the book is a huge annoyance and my 18mos daughter seems bored with it too.One reviewer wrote that they add to the phrase ""this is not my cat"" the type of cat they see. Well, I think that's exactly what Eric Carle should have done and didn't: ""this is a bobacat. this is not my cat"". That way, children learn different animal names, but still get repetition of language. Honestly, some of the pictures are a little hard to distinguish...I doubt a toddler figure out the difference between a cheetah and a panther without some type of indication in the book.Here's my suggestion: take the 3 phrases listed above and come up with your own story and skip buying the book. Spend your money on ""The Hungry Caterpillar""."
4,My son just loves this book,"This book can be a lot of fun to read with your toddler if you ""improvise"". When my 3 year old and I read it together, I always add words describing what we see on the pages. For instance, there is a Mexican Cowboy on one page and we say ""Mr. Cabalero, Have you seen my cat?"" and on the next page, we say ""This is not my cat....this is a jaguar"" So it becomes a learning experience and lots of fun for both of us. I highly recommend any of the Eric Carle books."
4,A cute slide-and-Peek board book,I noticed Amazon has the reading level of this book geared towards children 4 to 8 years old. I really think this book is intended for six months to 18 months. There are very few words in the book and the ones the book has are repeated constantly. My 18 month old granddaughter loved the repetitiveness of the book. The pictures are such that you can have a discussion or make up some sort of side story for your child. As usual Eric Carle doesn't disappoint.
5,Los valores y las virtudes que se reunen en,"este libro, asi como su forma de transmitir, SON LO QUE HA HECHO QUE EL MUNDO SUBSISTA AUN ENTRE GUERRAS Y EPIDEMIAS !Maravilloso para nostros y para los niños !"
5,ESTOS SON LOS VALORES...,"...QUE CONSERVAN UNIDA A LA FAMILIA LATINA. Es como si durante muchas generaciones,nuestros ancestros nos las hubieran heredado y ¡este libro los contiene todos!Es una obra de grandes cimientos morales para nuestros hijos, para nosotros mismos... Me cautivó el libro !!!"
5,EL REFLEJO MAS CLARO,Y PURO de los valores que diferencian al ser humano de la bestia !DEBERIA ESTAR EN TODAS LAS FAMILIAS Y LEERSE A LOS NIÑOS !Es un libro que nos salva el futuro y nos alivia el presente !
2,Not a quality product.,"I purchased two and each shows a different temperature (probably both wrong). The difference is greater than 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Obviously quality control does not exist. It seems that that paper part with those numbers are attached in a wrong position. Since it is in a closed glass cylinder, nothing one can do. If you are looking for acceptable quality, look elsewhere."
2,Marina Floating Thermometer,"Work, but not great. Doesn't come with suction cup. I hate it, but return it will cost more than the thermometer itself. I guess you get what you pay for. Won't buy this one again for sure"
2,"Educational, but racist","We watched ""Black and White"", the tape on Old English to modern English and ""Muvver Tongue"" in an upper level English linguistics class. I noticed that when persons of color spoke, subtitles were used. When whites spoke, we had to figure out what was being said. Most of us did not understand the Cockney too well. Also, African women were shown bare-breasted and the Australian aborigines were naked. They did not speak. These tapes were done in 1986, not 1886. The implication is that people of color speak English so poorly that it must be subtitled and that showing black women's breasts is necessary for the linguistic cause."
3,husband wanted,"startied watching can't watch too much at one time, not my idea of a good movie, some interesting points though"
4,"A bit dated, but good educational material.","We have watched most of this series in my History of the English Language class, a master's level class. While it is a bit dated, it is still good material. It deals with the evolution of English from the earlier Germanic languages, offshoots of English (American, Australian, Scots, etc.), English as an international language, and modern (as of early 80's) development in English."
3,Just Okay...,"These tasted nice, but for me were a little dry. And I wasn't wild about one of the ingredients: hydrogenated glucose syrup. The cookie does contain maltitol, which insures you eat them in moderation... if ya know what I mean. And if you don't... well, be warned: eat in moderation."
5,Great buy,"Easy to assemble, its good quality, its nice and the price is right. Who needs more? The rack on the bottom is a great idea."
4,Nice Cage,The cage is a very nice size for a small to mid size bird. My only complaint was the directions were very vague. After playing around with it it finally went together easily. It seems to be extremely sturdy and will give years of good use
4,Great Cage,"Assembly was really easy, although it did take about 40 minutes. The only thing I would recommend would be to fasten the cage itself to the base/stand with black zip-ties as we did. One bump and it's Bye Bye Birdie! Other than that, great cage! Our bird is very happy ;-)"
4,review of video review,This was an excellent review and the video was great. Thanks so much having a visual was great. I would recommend others to view it too.
4,Nice Suprise,I just put the cage together without any instructions which wasn't very difficult. It took about 20 minutes from getting it out to the bird was sitting on the perch. Very good cage for the money.
3,Bird Cage Follies,"The cage is lovely when put together. I would not use the word sturdy to describe the finished product (no instructions, bent metal pieces and a tray with holes in it from shipping unprotected next to the wires of the cage.) Nothing fits exactly but you can tighten things up with needle nose pliers and use wire to hold top corners that do not meet. It may do, though, it may do. It does look lovely. Not much support from the company that makes them. I was going to send it back but because they took so long in responding and the response was as clear as the (non)instructions I decided to go ahead and fix the metal legs so they could attach and tape the broken tray with holes. I bought hardwood dowels to make additional perches and do not expect the bird to use the open top. The lower shelf for storage will not hold heavy items, it is fine for newspaper lining and maybe a small container of food."
2,big mistake,"This item was shipped to us with the wrong instructions on how to put it together and a weld on the cage was broken and i have contacted the company on numerous occations to resolve the issue and they haven't responded! bad service and now i am left with a broken cage and a way my bird can get hurt or out of her cage. this is very poor business if you ask me, i totally am very disappointed in my purchase."
4,A good read that leaves you disturbed at the concepts.,"I liked this book. It's reminiscent of Huxley's ""Brave New World"". Similar in concept. In Huxley's world, they alter the fetus producing dim witted, manageable humans for cheap labor. In ""Halfway Human"", Gilman sets it up where lack of intervention will produce the same results. If you are like me and and think that slavery and the manipulation of people to that purpose is abhorrent, you'll find this book interesting."
2,Did not work as well as planned,"I bought this sweeper to help pick-up those areas of the house where it is difficult to carry my heavier electric sweeper. But I am disappointed with how little the mechanical sweeper picks-up. I have to run it over and over the same area to see any difference, and even then it leaves behind plenty. All in all, a waste of money and time."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this product two months ago, and it broke (manufacturer's defect), fortuntately Amazon has excellent customer service and I was able to return the item for a credit."
5,a great album,"I will admit....I am biased. They are college friends of mine. But this is one of my favorite albums of all time. When those that are not...an obvious view of the glory to come To conquer and destroy...my motto Perpetua Simone...a lonely tale about a lonely girl seeking solace and comfort where she will never find either Mincemeat...one of the most powerful ""christian"" songs ever, in my humble opinion Sweet God...yes, He is Glenn says...is Eddie Van Halen playing on this? Euphrates with Golden Hands...a damn fine song about the unraveling of our society and our foundation...I got a great video idea for this song... Robed in Light...another homage to that which will come To you who gave me...that terrible van accident, and what it all meant.Just great stuff. I am proud to know them."
4,First video for 14 month,"This is the first Barney video that I or my then 14 month old daughter had ever watched. She is a fussy eater so I was desperate to show her anything that would grab her attention. It took some getting used to the characters but they grow on you. I love the songs and my daughter totally enjoyed the entire show. Her first favorite song at the time was ""Dickory Dickory dare"" about the Flying pig. It is really short, I don't think it is more than 30 mins or around that. But it is good. Giving it four stars because I wish it was longer. Otherwise, great quality and sound and content."
4,"great story, well done Nina Bruhns","I bought the book as I am interested in the native culture of America, that part came a bit short though but otherwise the book has a great love story, which is developing rather nicely over the full book. I could not put it down, if you like romance, you will like this book!"
5,Loved it!,Loved the story line and characters. Great read. Want to read more about these characters.Wish for just a little more back story.
3,It's just average,I read this book because I'm interested in Native American culture and this one seemed not to be the standard historical. The first half was terrific then it went downhill for me. I finished it but it took some effort.
3,Romance,For a romance it was good. The author was discriptive and brought out the differences in their lives and why they acted like they did. Adult content.
4,Nice little romance with Indian's and lots of other people 3.5 stars,3.5 Stars This is an interesting story about a woman who has recently broken up with an emotionally abusive fiance and meets a hot Amer-Indian warrior at a Pow-wow. In his costume and war-paint he is nothing like the lawyer she meets six months later in a power suit.Rini fled from Cole when she saw the dancer surrounded by female fans and believed he was a cheat like her ex. Their reunion is complicated by the fact Rini was pressured into visiting a baby adoption lawyer by her sister who hoped to adopt Rini's unborn baby.This rings all sorts of alarm bells for Cole who was adopted as a baby by a non-Amer-Indian family and struggled with his identity as a teen.There are lots of secondary characters in this book but none that stand out much as spin off romances.I enjoyed the story with a different kind of hero and a heroine who grew through her interaction with him.
4,Touching romance,A nice look at Native American culture for contemporary people as well as a touching love story.The Warrior's MaidenThe Paris Caper (full length romantic thriller)
5,Wow! COLTON LONETREE - WHEREFORE ART THOU?,"You must know by now by reading the other reviews what the story is about.It was great the way Cole kind of converted Rini's sister Alex finally to appreciate him.Meeting Cole's adopted parents and finding out how loving and wonderful they were and to find that he has a half brother Billy increased his family ties along with his cousins on the Rez. I had full sympathies for Cole's birth mother. Loved meeting her and hearing her story.I was kind of chuckling when Jeff turned up and really appreciated the turn of events his inclusion brought about. Can't say much for Cole's ex-wife though. Selfish little witch, but human.But, Oh boy, if her next story isn't about Cole's best friend, Roman ""Renegade"" Santangelo I will certainly have a fit. [grin]This was one truly great story -- still can't get over the introduction -- Fantastic! Wow! my kind of Warrior!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- Please don't miss it."
2,So disappointed,"Where to start? I didn't like the writing style for a start, neither could I really like any of the characters.I also like my romance readings to be sexy and this one was definitely not, or at least I didn't find it so. Their dialogues and ""inner thoughts"" about each other were so affected I couldn't stop rolling up my eyes every two sentences... so even if I've managed to finish it, I'm deleting it from my kindle."
4,Interesting Read,My 7th grader was required to have this book for a Watershed Program at her school. We read it together and learned so much about how we as humans effect the watersheds. I look forward to learning more on this subject through her classes this year.
5,Amazing!!!!,"This CD came out of nowhere. I was completely taken off my feet by this soulful gospel CD. This has to be the best of its kind since God's Property effort a few years ago. This CD will get you moving your feet and giving praise to our Lord at the same time. The fast tracks are nice, but the slow ones are really heart moving and inspirational. Like ""Closer"" which is my favorite song. I must have listened to that song like 4 times in a row one time. And ""For you Lord"" and ""When I see you"". These are awesome songs and I appreciate the effort that Brent Jones and the tp mobb put forth on this effort. It was a welcome pleasure to listen to! The only thing that I found I didn't likeabout this CD was on a couple of songs they refer to God as ""Daddy"". While the term may be synonymous here on earth for our earthly fathers. It isn't a term to be used when referring to our Lord. He is all powerful and he deserves to be respected by using one of his other many names referred to by scripture itself."
5,You can feel the music!,This CD is great. I got to see this group live and had to buy the CD. They are amazing and the words in their songs can be felt by your soul!
1,Don't bother,"Don't waste your time or money on this stinker. No plot sex, the was boring and frankly anyone who thinks it's sexy to sleep w/your boyfriends father is sick. Hazel has no personality and she and Alistair had no chemistry. Book is basically a few indiscriminate sex scenes with Hazel and strangers for no reason whatsoever. It seemed the author just threw some sex words together randomly throughout the book. I have read dozens of Black Lace books and this one really deserved 0 stars but that wasn't an option. Try Opening Acts, Menage, Dreaming Spires instead."
4,It may not be heavyweight erotica ....,"but this book is kind of a carefree trip through the mind of a contemporary woman in the UK today.Our heroine, Hazel, may not be a nuclear engineer but thats what makes it interesting because she certainly doen't try to be something that she is not. What she is, is a young woman that thoroughly enjoys sex and in thise monets that she is not physically 'doing it' she manages to let her mind bring her that kaleidescope of sexual pleasures ad infinitum...It is very very light erotica so don't expect pursuit, capture, submission and all those delicious little scenes than make Victorian erotica great ... This more a class by it'self of what I would calll 'In your face erotica' ......"
3,El Circulo Vicioso,"Alot of bad acting, but the movie was entertaining as hell.remowwww.remolacha.net"
4,"Has flaws, but still enjoyable.","A Visit From Sir Nicholas is an enjoyable read if you can look past the flaws. Elizabeth's reasons for denying what she feels for Nicholas are understandable, but she can get a little annoying. Nicholas and Elizabeth both make decisions that can be frustrating to the reader because the decisions they make that keeps them apart seem completely unneccesary to an outsider. However, Victoria Alexander has provided plenty of explanation concerning WHY the characters do what they do, so the characters actions are consistent with their personality. Once I understood Elizabeth and Nicholas, I enjoyed watching them both overcome their hangups and come together. I especially like how A Christmas Carol was incorporated into the book. I was touched by how Nicholas cherished the book because Elizabeth had given it to him."
2,couldn't get into it...,"I quit this book at about 80 pages. In most regencies you either see an ""unmatched"" couple buck society and be possibly snubbed for true love OR do the ""noble"" thing and marry for a proper match and forsake true love. The two characters in this book do the latter but meet up again 10 years later. I'm one of those who would rather they face scandal and be together so this was not my cup of tea. Miss Alexander does seem a very compentant writer so I plan on trying other of her books."
3,Fell apart.,"The begining was really good. Started off on a swift ride, costing along with the story, then all the sudden, it falls apart. It was going good and I was thinking to myself that the other reviewers were wrong, and if this book was suppose to be bad compared to her other books, then she must be really good. Then I finished the book thinking man, they were right. What was she talking about. Sorry folks, on this book majority rules. I would have to then agree again and say try out a different story by this author. She is witty and even though this book could have been way better, it was not a waste of time. It was a Christmas story as well, so it has the spirit in it. Nick ws not that bad, actually it was the heroine who wore me out with all the lame excuses. But even she was not that bad. It was more the story line that fell apart. Weak effort."
3,3 and 1/2 stars for this holiday romance,"This is the first book by Alexander that I have read. I was impressed by her wonderful dialogue, particularly between the heroine and hero and the heroine and her sister.However, I agree with the other reviewers that the heroine could grate on you after a while. Her childish behavior and quick temper were annoying. Another annoying thing was the author's endless need to remind us that Lizzie wasn't as ""frivolous"" as she appeared. We got it the first few times. :-)"
1,Dr. Baugh's Agenda,"Dont be fooled people. Dr. Baugh is not a scientist, and he is out to prove his narrow fundamentalist point of view. He has no regard for the scientific method, and convienently substitutes biblical teachings for scientific data.Rational clear-thinking people cannot let people like this have influence in our educational system.Additionally we cannot let narrow minded fundamentalists hi jack Christianity with their own bizarre beliefs. Not all Christians believe this creation science nonsense."
1,this man is a joke...,"he's NOT an acredited scientist, his degrees are dubious, at best. his theories are absurd. His lack of proof is highly disturbing. To take this book seriously would be a severe mistake. He is avoided by all who wish to be taken seriosly, in the field of creationism.I read it for a laugh, but ended up being very afraid that a man this disturbed could have an influence on others."
5,the Truth about the Theory of Evolution,The author of this book is Dr. Karl Baugh. He is a highly educated man who came to the truth about the Theory of Evolution after much careful thought. He lays out the facts about why evolution just isn't possible.
5,A very well documented book!,The other comments from evolutionists about this book attack just the author instead of comming with convinsing arguments against the facts presented in the book. They do this for the simple reason that the author attacks the religion of evolution were a person's faith has to be greater that in any other religion.
5,Against All Odds,"Dr. Carl Baugh demonstrates how unscientific Darwwins Theory of Evolution is through various scientific studies. He also shows how ""Religious"" its adherents are by numerous examples (many of well known academic/ teachers).Although I could cite many examples here, I believe it would be best for the a person that has any inkling of just how really silly both Darwin and the Evolution Theory are, to read the book (Its inexpensive had contains much information and wisdom) and realize that academics that spout this theory deny all scientific methodology. Evolution is a belief system that ""Sounds Scientific"" but is based on principals that are unprovable (and in most cases wrong) and require a giant leap of faith. In short, Evolution is a ""Religion"" for Humanists."
1,Science?,"Using the same well refuted arguments (the supposedly ""human"" footsteps inside a dinosaur's print) and circuitous logic (because it seems complex to me therefore there must be a designer) as any other 100 religious creationists before him, the author treads no new ground. As additional food for thought, the author's two graduate degrees come from the same internet diploma mill, ""Pacific International University"". This supposed ""institution"" (actually located in Springfield, Missouri) lists its mission statement #4 as, ""There is a total commitment by the Faculty to the inerrant Word of God and the Lordship of Christ."" This conflicts with the possibility of objective analysis."
4,preparation/reflection material,"Ill keep this short...Im actually 2/3 of the way thru Cahalan's book on Ed. I purchased the book for the sole purpose of filling in the ""blank spots"" in Abbey's life, one that I admire. The book has, in fact, done this well. But more than that, fans of Abbey's writing will enjoy the background information about each book or essay...the surprising autobiographical nature of most of his work and even insight into the personal nature of the man...more info than Abbey probably would have liked leaked out to the ""masses"". A very good reference book for Cactus Ed's fans."
1,Gazelle Total Body Workout 3 pack tapes,"I ordered the set of three tapes as a gift based upon the picture of them. When I received them, they were not at all as shown. The tapes were in plain white cardboard sleeves with no markings whatsoever showing what they were. There is no way I can give this as a gift. When I went to return them, I was informed that I would be responsible for paying the shipping for them being sent and returned. I don't think this is fair at all-if I had been sent what I ordered, I wouldn't be returning them!"
1,NOT LARGE AT ALL,THE DESIGN IS NICE BUT IS WAY TOO SMALL; IS LIKE FOR A LITTLE GIRL TO USE...EVEN IT SAID LARGE IS NOT....
4,Fun show!,"I had stumbled across this series one day at the store and decided to check it out, even though it was toward the end of the series. My wife and I absolutely fell in love with this show. So much so we decided to purchase the entire series.Volume 4 wraps up the series with the last 2 discs. The final 3 episodes I can only describe as epic. Huge space battles and a morphing battleship in space, intentions are revealed, and the only hope for the universe are Eclair and Lumiere, two superpowered kids. Lumiere, who can control most electric or computerized devices, and Eclair with her wicked lipstick and hyperspeed, they bring the fun to the show.So if you are thinking of getting this, do it, its worth it."
3,Good Textbook,This was the textbook used in my American Literature I class last semester. Volume Two is being used in the second half that I am taking this semester. The book offers a good collection of American Literature from the earliest European Explorers to the late 1800's. The additional information offered in the introductions to each author and literary time period adds to the student's understanding of the works.
2,It's Ok,The footnotes are numbered strangely and they don't elaborate on the footnoted item very well.
2,"Ok, but bent shaft","I know this is a cheap frother, but the shaft bends so easy. Once bent it will not spin properly. I have to bend it back and then it works fine.Cleans really easy, nice stand."
4,Powerful,"Is very powerful, , works great, for best milk foamwe use Parmalat.Better than the other bonjour frother.We love it."
3,Works great...with some duct tape,Maybe it's just mine but it's got a serious design flaw. Once the batteries go in the top won't stay closed. Some packaging tape has solved the problem...but seriously why do I have to use packaging tape on a brand new item?I love it so much I won't return it. It froths milk up super quick and is easy to clean!
1,this thing is terrible,"cover extremely hard to close with batteries in it, if You do manage to close it, push button is very hard to press almost making it two hand unit in order to operate the damn thing...once You got it running (if You get that far)little disk spins like crazy and after about 5 minutes of trying to froth skim milk i gave up...packed it up and shipped back to amazon. Whoever designed it should be fired on the spot, I wouln't take this frother for free as it's completely unusable.My search continues...."
2,Battery compartment won't close!,"Just returned this item to Amazon. The battery compartment won't close properly anymore. Seems like the springs/wires underneath the batteries are too strong and won't allow the upper part to close well. It became useless and got a refund thanks to Amazon easy returns. The + and - signs for the batteries are displayed but very lightly so it's not straightforward. For the very short time the frother worked, the latte was alright."
2,Baixa qualidade - Poor quality,"Portugus:Eu tenho um frother destes desde 2006. Por isso é que resolvi comprar mais 2. MAS, infelizmente, diminuiram a qualidade do produto. Explico.- a tampa no fecha perfeitamente quando as pilhas esto dentro.- o ao inoxidável no é to bom quanto o primeiro frother que comprei. Estes 2 so mais fracos que meu primeiro.- O motor ainda é excelente.English:I've already had a frother from Bonjour since 2006. Because that frother I decided to buy 2 more. BUT, unfortunately, frother's quality was reduced. I'll explain.- The cover not close properly and firmly when batteries was inside.- Stainless steel isn't good like my first frother. This frother is weakest than my first.- the machine is still excellent."
1,All this power without results,It's great to look at but my kitchen spoon has better results. I got a different one from JcPenny for $9.99 and it works wonders with my latte.
1,Frother that doesn't froth,"Our Bonjour ""Primo Latte"" frother finally gave up the goose, and we didn't hesitate to get a replacement; we had been pleased with the product. Instead, we bought this ""Cafe Latte Frother"", as it appears to be Bonjour's next generation. Wow. I've never seen such a chasm between construction quality and performance. It is super solid and powerful, and yet it doesn't froth the milk at all! It's worthless.It you want to froth, I recommend you getBonJour Primo Latte Frother with Stand, Black/Brushed Aluminumwhile they're still available; less power, not as solid, but works 10 times better."
1,Frustration,"After reading several reviews I opted for this model even after several reviewers remarked on the difficulty keeping the top on. Don't bother unless you're into frustration. The lid will NOT stay on. I've inserted the batteries correctly, even changed battery brand, and the lid pops right off after twisting it closed. I'm sending it right back."
1,Worthless,"Absolutely worthless. Terrible design, or terrible quality control, don't know. I see some people got it to work, but after placing batteries in the holder, I absolutely could not get it to close. Battery springs were compressed so tight they would force the top back off. I could *not* push the top on far enough to get all the catches to engage, and even if I could (I got it on all the way once), there was so much force from the springs that it popped the top back off anyway. Unusable."
1,Poor Construction,"Received this today. Now, the first thing I noticed was the tab on the box appeared to have been opened before. Returned from someone else???I'm pretty mechanically inclined, put cards & memory in my computer, take apart & clean. I popped this open to put in the batteries (first problem, illustration shows a diagonal conformation, battery holder shows parrallel arrangement of + & - tips).Body had no obvious indicators to match bottom to top, but I finally figured out how it went together, but after turning clockwise, it would not stay closed, and it was very difficult to hold the two halves together to get them to mesh. Button rubber cover was loose and the button would work while disconnected, but would not compress while closed. I finally gave up, and repackaged for return."
2,Au Revoir to BonJour Frother?,"I was very excited to receive my frother for Christmas. However, within the first month, it fell over in the stand on the counter. The top part sealing in the batteries became separated, and the frother 'wheel' at the bottom fell off. I put it back together, but now I always have to hold it together when I use it. This morning I lost the wheel (again) in my coffee cup. I am disappointed because it seemed so heavy duty and powerful. The frothing part works well if I hold it together."
1,Difficult Set Up,"I purchased this frother for my daughter as a Christmas present because of positive reviews. We had a difficult time installing the batteries. The battery markings inside the chamber were unclear. The top of the frother seemed fragile and felt as if it would break. The top does not easily fit onto the frother.BonJour Frother, Automatic Battery Powered Caf? Latte with Stand, White/GrayThe frother tilted over in the metal stand. We never got the frother to work and will be returning it for a refund. I would not recommend this for purchase."
2,Doesn't froth the milk,"It's an well built, attractive product but doesn't whip the milk. Instead of a whip on the end it's a disk that just mixes."
1,Design: 10 - Performance: 0,"Does not froth milk even nearly as well as other units, even much cheaper ones. The ""frothing disk"" makes milk spin like crazy but creates very little foam. ""Soft Touch"" button very difficult to hold down for the required time to keep unit turned on. Position of the button on top requires holding it with a clenched fist which is very uncomfortable because of the force required to hold the button. I'm returning it."
1,"Got two, none worked","I got this product as a gift - it did not work. I felt bad about bothering the person who gave me the gift, so I ordered another one.much to my surprise, it did not work either.Well, maybe I have an amazing bad luck, but.... I cannot give this product a good rating, for obvious reasons"
1,Bonjour Frother,This is made very cheap. I have to return it because it does not close properly with the battery installed. Very disappointed!
1,Not what i expected,"Not recomended.This is the third one i buy nad i am not satisfied at all.The problem is that the battery springs are so strong that will not allow the cover to seat properly. Even if you force it on, it will pop out soon enough.I previously got two of those from Amazon and there were no issue whatosever. I checked and found out that the old ones used much softer springs.I managed to fix the battery spring issue by snipping off half of each of the springs. Not a task for the faint-hearted.I really liked this device. Too bad they lack quality control or whatever and ruin a perfectly capable device."
1,Terrible Design,"Don't buy this unless you want to be frustrated trying to get the top of the battery compartment to stay on. After 30 minutes of trying, I hadn't gotten the top to stay on. It is going back to Amazon immediately."
1,Misled by positive reviews,"Unfortunately, the reviews of this product that were marked most helpful ( and thus appeared first) were glowing and superficial and we didn't notice that there were even more reviews that gave this terrible ratings based on its shoddy construction. LIke many of the latter reviewers, we were not able to get our unit to stay together once the batteries were inserted, so it was basically useless. Rather than resort to duct tape (as one of the 5 star reviewers did), we have elected to return it to Amazon and buy theAerolatte 5 Milk Frother, Satin Finishproduct (which we have used for years) for just a few dollars more. Regrettably, as other reviewers of that product have noted, the longevity of the Aerolatte units has declined over the years and we now find that we have to replace them after just a few months. Also, they require fully charged batteries to work properly, so rechargeable batteries are advisable."
2,BAD frother!,"I had this same model and I broke it by dropping it, so I got another. The exact SAME model, yet this one is clearly defective. I should have returned it but I thought it was weak batteries. No, it was not the batties being weak. The frother oscillates in an weirdly off-balance elliptical pattern and is weak. It couldn't whip AIR. The first one worked great--too bad..."
1,Fatal Design Flaw,"Like others here, I owned an older model with a different battery interior design. It still works well, but shows some wear, so I bought another. The new one looks the same on the outside, but the battery compartment is configured differently, and requires four (4) AA batteries. When empty, it closes and locks fine. With 4 batteries loaded, the pressure from the springs snaps the flimsy plastic retaining lugs open; it won't lock, period. True of both the unit I bought and the replacement I requested.Test it yourself, adding batteries one at a time. 1=flawless closing. 2, ditto. 3... starts to get weird. 4 = non-functionality.A perfect example of a good product ruined by cheapskate design and flimsy construction. Skip this one, it's a waste of time and money."
3,Less than overjoyed,This is the second Bonjour Frother that I have purchased. The first was an older model which I thoroughly enjoyed but eventually it wore out and needed to be replaced. The quality of this new frother is not nearly as good as the first one. The motor works well but the shaft is not true and the spinner tends to wobble. The manufacturers quality control department needs a bit of help.
4,Great little frother,"I am always on a mission for the perfect coffee/milk frother. I use it to make Greek ice coffee, called Frappe, and it works great. I am a big fan of BonJour products. They are so hard to find. If Amazon doesn't have it, well then, no one has it. The price was great too. They do tend to break easily if overused or not used properly, so I really take care of mine. It has lasted at least a year now, and I'm very happy with it. The color is nice too. The only thing I would say to be careful of, is the way you insert the batteries. Make sure you look on the black plastic part to see which way to insert the batteries. This will ensure that it works and you don't think it's broken. Also, if you plan to overuse it in one setting, make sure you change out the batteries when they are dying, because a girlfriend of mine bought one as well, and from overuse (many many coffees later) the insides melted. yikes.Other uses:* also great for sauces"
1,Doesn't work-batteries don't fit!,"As noted by other reviews, the +/- terminals are mismarked for battery placement - first indication of shoddy design. 0nce you put the four AA batteries in, the top no longer fits on the bottom. Buy a different model!"
1,Didn't Work,"This frother did not work at all. Once the batteries were in, it put so muchpressure on the catch that I had to re-close it several times to get it to holdand then - nothing - absolutely could not get it to turn at all. I had a similarone - same brand - that was absolutely fabulous same design (disk) as this andI loved it. The rack was neat and had it worked I think it would definetly havebeen a favorite. But if you are thinking of buying one of these - maybe don'ttry this one - I should have been able to at least turn the whip with my handand it wouldn't turn at all. Apparently just stuck. I sent mine back."
1,like mark said ...it doesnt work!!,"I'll keep it short it just doesn't work.Not at all,with any sort of milk.I don't know how these other people can say how well this product works when it doesn't.I'm very unhappy with this product.I would highly recommend you find something else.I took it all the way to Thailand with me,its not making the return trip."
2,Only for those that care about the history of the gripper,"This book can be described in one word: pointless. Seriously, I was looking to read this book and get tips about grip workouts using their gripper product. For over 50 pages you get the history of the gripper, how they progressed, myths, etc. WHO CARES!!!There were some good tips towards the end, but these same tips I found for free in many locations, especially at www.gripboard.com. I even emailed IronMind asking for a good book about gripper only workouts; their reply was this book. When I replied back to them of what I am saying now, the PhD author of the book actually replied. He was not pleased at all to hear what I had to say, but hey the truth hurts."
4,A great read for closing brick-like grippers,"Although some of the information is a bit extreme at times, this book does give you the information necessary to progress though harder grippers."
1,Use any Bible but this one,"We used this Bible for family prayer time, and gave it a fair shot, reading it cover to cover.My problems with this text are:1) It doesn't include all of the books of the Bible (all 73)2) The translation is laughable in parts (I think it was ""holy box"" instead of ark of the covenant)3) The prayer starters encourage readers to draw inane moralistic conclusions from a dramatic portion of Scripture4) The English is so stilted that it is possible to read a whole page and not get any sense at all what is being said.I would rather use almost anything instead of this book. Don't bother purchasing, unless you want a .01 copy to cut out the artwork for another project."
4,Good toy for a good price,"We bought this toy for our daughter who is 4 1/2 and she didn't put it down for a week. She loved all the little pieces (not good for our 1 year old) and she loved the way you could make their diaper rash go away. Our 7 year old played with it a little bit but I would say it would be better for the 3-6 age range. One of the arms fell off but was real easy to put back on. Since buying this set we have also purchased the stroller set and the rocking horse set. I thought they were are little pricey but my daughter loved having more ""stuff"" to go with each baby. Overall, I think this was one of the best presents my daughter received for Christmas."
3,IMPOSSIBLE DRAWERS!!!,"The dolls are very cute and our 4 1/2 year old likes them, but she cannot use the drawers on the changing table. They are almost impossible to open. My very coordinated 9 year old cannot even open them. I have to pry them open myself. I called MGA about this and they said I was the first complaint they have gotten. Hard to believe after reading all these reviews!!!"
4,Good Gospel!!,I see that Virtue has been around for quite some time but I'm new to their music and must say that by far I really enjoy it. It really has the R&B and at the same time good Godly praise to it. I truely recommend it for a first time buyer of Virtue.
4,U'll able to love her...,one day i was switching trough tv channels and suddenly caught this song was played on mtv.I was stunned.What a powerful vocals...and this song is very danceable too!Her vocals are very outstanding and the dance music will put a hook on ur head for few days.It was no doubt the song was composed by a swedish composer.(no wonder!)I didnt know who jessica was back then.but this song really stay on my head untill one day i heard this tune was played in a record store.I bought the cd single after the salesman told me it was her.'To be able to love' is one of my fav. track untill now.If you think Samantha Mumba is good.Well Jessica Folker give you better than that.Go and get the single.
5,Love horse stories,I grew up reading all the Walter Farley's books. I love reading horse stories and am introducing them to my granddaughters. Terri Farley seems to have the same wonderful way of writing.
5,This Book Is AWESOME!!!!,This was one of the best books i've EVER READ! I'm in love with this series! Everybody should read them weather your a horse lover (like me :D) or not. There's a lot of adventure and suspense...and even some surprises! I'm not gonna give the book away...you'll just have to read it for yourself! Read this book! I can't wait to read the rest! You've done and awesome job Terri!
5,The Wonderful Wild One,This book was a hit to all ages. It was a very good start for the Phantom Stallion set. I am looking forward to reading all the books. Good job to Terri Farley for writing these wonderful books. The Wild One is a good story for everyone to read.
3,Message Board For The Phantom Stallion Series,"I have read this book and the rest of the series currently available. In some ways I liked the series a lot and in others, I was not as impressed. Overall though, I think it is a decent series and that most people who enjoy reading about horses will enjoy it as well, perhaps not as much as some they have read but I think it at least deserves a chance.(...)"
1,&#65533;The Wild One&#65533;,"In my riding lesson, we were doing a little project about how books truthfully describe horses and riding and how they make up lies. My instructor pointed out that this book had a lot of lies, and we were to find them. The biggest one we discussed is about Sam riding off with the wild horses. It is very unlikely that she wouldn't get trampled or badly hurt alone at night with wild horses. We also discussed that someone with this level of maturity probably shouldn't be riding. If someone tried the things that Sam did in this book they would be mentally and physically hurt."
2,Did not like it.,"I would say this book is not good. It is about a girl who falls from her horse. Her father sends her away and the horse runs away. She comes back and sees a weird horse which could be hers. It has the same subject in every book, it's boring and repetitive.The end was also bad. Does sam want the horse or not? I would reccomend the saddle club, pony pals or heartland instead. If you want books about riding western read the linda craig adventures. Two thumbs down for this book."
2,Rockport M4118 Black men's oxford.,"I have been buying this model for more than a decade because of its durability and comfort as a semi-dress, non-formal work shoe. I currently have two pairs that I was seeking to replace because of heel wear.The new shoes were not at all like my previous pairs. The lasts are too stiff, and the soles are made of cheap plastic rather than very durable rubber (I think my first pairs of these had vibram soles).I decided to send them back. Amazon declined to pay shipping because I said it was an ""unexpected style"" issue. I would like to dispute this, but I don't know where to do that."
4,"Comfortable, but less formal than the picture suggests","These shoes are very comfortable, and pass the test for a long day on one's feet. The waterproofing appears to be effective. The only complaint I had was that the shoes in person appear much less formal than I had anticipated based on the picture shown. They are not as appropriate a fit for my business casual attire as I had hoped."
3,"Very comfortable at first, but wears poorly.",I've owned these for just under a year. At first they were very comfortable. However the sole wore out very quickly and unevenly and began giving me knee problems (granted I'm 6'5 + 225 lbs). Switched shoes and the knee problems went away within a couple of days. However I am planning to purchase a second pair because I hate shoe shopping and I know these are very comfortable and will give me about 6-months wear.
4,Comfortable but Soft Soles,"I have owned 5 pairs of these shoes over the last 6 or 7 years and have put an incredible number of miles on each of them. I've worn worn them daily for hours on end; from the office to walks around the neighborhood. I have 13 4E feet (but wear these in a 12 XW) so when I find a good looking shoe that fits for a reasonable price I pray they don't stop making them. The shoes, as a whole, are quite durable. I was actually moving logs around in a fire with one pair a week ago. I polished them up and wore back into the office this week. But the sole is basically a hard foam. It doesn't last nearly as long as the shoe does, especially the heel. These shoes can be resoled but it's $50 for a $75 pair of shoes; not saving much. I had a one year old pair resoled with a tougher rubber when I was living overseas (and couldn't find another pair) and finally had to toss them after another four years of heavy use."
4,My husband likes these shoes,"I purchased these shoes as a Christmas gift for my husband. He's been wearing it a lot. He says it's comfortable, and he has not experienced the squeeking from the shoes as some other reviews had pointed out. I was hoping it has more of a dressier look. It really looks better with jeans and not as good with kahki's."
3,Not Impressed,"I read many reveiws before buying these shoes and I have to say I am quite let down on the comfort that I expected out of Rockports. I spend a lot of time between the office and the warehouse floors and I needs comfort. Seems that only sneakers feel good enough to walk on the concrete floors. I have tried Dr Martin's, Sketchers, Dockers, Timberlands..Etc..Etc..Many $$ spent trying to find the right shoes and still have not found them..Still Looking..I am 5'9"" and 180lbs, 41 yrs old, athlectic and have been in the warehouse business 22 yrs if that helps anyone reading this reveiw.Now these shoes are very light weight and look good and are barley ok in comfort in my opinion. Not worth my money."
5,Exceptional quality and comfort!,"These shoes are amazing. The sole is thick enough to get through snow and sleet that tends to accumolate in cities without weighing the shoes down at all. They are FAR lighter than they appear. As for comfort I have been able to wear them for 16 hours straight without any issues, they might not be as comfortable as a broken in pair of sneakers, but they come darn close."
4,Satisfied customer fro Amazon.,"Purchased before. Appearance and comfort fine. Bottom of previous pair wore out (tread gone) before tops.Tops still in great shape but no longer has needed traction. These cannot be resoled, a shame. Top ofjust purchased shoes has oily feel (waterproofing?). Hope this does not interfere with creating a high shine."
4,Comfortable casual shoe,Package delivered OK in a shoe-sized box. Very comfortable shoe but be careful when dropping liquid on it (stain doesn't go away). They are great for casual wear. It is water resistant!
3,shoes,the shoes were delivered on time. they are comfortable but like most new shoes are very stiff.one big problem i order black they sent brown there are other reviews i read that also ordered black and recieved brown.i will keep the brown shoe but the warehouse needs to be more accurrate.
2,cimfortable but styling miscues,These shoes are Rockport comfortable but very ugly styling. The toe box is very wide and flat so it makes just a simple looking shoe resemble very wide duck feet. Unless you have very very wide feet do not buy these shoes. You will not be happy. The picture in the catalogue is quite deceiving and does not represent how poortly these shoes actually appear. I wish i had sent them back!
3,Bland and plastic(y),"The shoes are comfortable, without great support.They look and feel a bit cheap. The crease in the front makes it looks like it isn't very good leather."
3,Not the same quality it used to be,"I have been wearing this model for over twenty years. When they switched from Vibram soles a few years ago the quality declined significantly. Previously I got two years of daily use out of the shoes, now I get less than a year, with holes wearing through the inner sole in the heel and the mid-foot. I still find them very comfortable and the waterproof feature makes them great in the rain, but I yearn for the better quality of the previous model. Over the years I found that the Rockport quality has deteriorated. A few years ago I purchased a pair of wingtips with the Rockport alternate budget brand they were terrible. I believe they ultimately pulled that product line from the market, but the quality is not the same."
4,the best,"have been buying this shoe a least 15 yrs. i m in sales and on my feet alot.they are the only shoe that keeps my feet from not hurting. the toe area is big, they are waterproof and ideal if like me you are in and out of rain and snow.traction is great. the down side is the tread wears quickly if walking outside on asphalt or cement. the other down side is the cost. by far for the money they beat a cheap pair of shoes.they may not be the best looking but you can spend 12 hrs in them like i do and feet feel great."
4,My shoe,"I have been wearing this shoe for the last 4 years. It is the shoe that I use for work. I got my first pair and loved them. Firstly I work on my feet 50-60 hours a week in restaurants. These shoes are durable, long lasting and can always be polished to look professional. If I had to comment on anything negative I would say that I wish that there was more shinny version. Until that comes along I am loyal."
4,Great!,We love this product. We order these every other year to replace the ones we have and really like it.
4,Got what I was looking for,Very comfortable out of the box as have been other Rockport shoes I've purchased over the years. I recommend these shoes.
1,Rubber eraser sole,"While this shoe is extremely comfortable and handsome but its quality and durability is extremely awful. The bottom sole appears to be made of soft rubber eraser and thread were completely worn out after 8 months! The upper leather started to peal off as well. All I did was walking around the office, never once did I abuse them. And I weight at just 185 lbs so that shouldn't be a problem. I wouldn't recommend this shoe at this price. At this price, they should be made to last at least 2 years. They should've replaced the bottom sole with polyurethane material instead of rubber. I'm not pleased with the price I paid for this pair."
4,I like these shoes but watch out for width.,"These are really nice and well made shoes. Actually this is the second pair I bought; the first pair was black. I found that the shoe was narrower than I expected. The first pair I ordered the width that my foot is and they were a bit tight on my toes. Knowing that, I ordered the second pair in the wide width and the shoes are what most manufacturers would call medium width. You can return the shoes to Amazon if you're not happy but you might want to order a little wider that you normally would."
4,Very Comfortable Shoe,"I have been wearing these shoes for some time now and have purchased multiple pairs over the years. They are a very comfortable shoe for work, and casual dress! They wear very well! Rockport makes very nice shoes!!!"
4,Good Shoe,I bought this shoe on line because it has a thick sole so that my feel don't feel the ground coldness.
4,"rockport men's northfield oxford, expresso nubuck","these shoes are very comfy, and durable. well worth the money. daniel"
2,not what they used to be,"I have an older pair of rockport suede oxfords and they are one of my favorite pair of shoes. When I got these (took forever) I was very disappointed with the quality, they seemed very stiff and overall just a much cheaper looking and feeling product than what I am used to from rockport."
3,"Ugly, Old Man Shoes.","Comfortable. If only they hadn't attached a padded lip around the top of the heel and tongue. Ugly! To make matters worse, Rockport has two-toned these shoes by coloring the padded areas a darker shade of brown than the rest. All in all, it gives the impression of the kind of functional, but thoroughly ugly, wearing apparel that is frequently designed for use by senior citizens: i.e. those velcro-strapped shoes you see, spandex slacks, and THESE SHOES!"
4,Great !!,"Great !!! Just what I wanted. BUT, why won't you ship this to Canada?Contrary to your US website, this is not available thru Amazon.caAnswer please !! / J"
2,Damaged product-Rockport Northfield,"I purchased this shoe for my son, who had gotten the same style of shoe from Zappos last year. Both of the shoes that I received from Amazon were stained, so I returned them and ordered again from Zappos. So although we like the style and comfort, the service was not adequate."
3,shoes,the free shipping promoted by Amazon for this purchase of more than $ 25 was a $ 4.95 charge for shipping. I guess that is supposed to be close to free. the product was more than $ 70 which is usually more than $ 25.
4,The Ultimate Doors Companion!,"This not just a book of collection. This tells the story behind each album and each song of the Doors, what songs made up the A and B sides of a single, each of Jim's books, not to mention lists of most popular books, music and movies of each year the Doors were together from 1965-1971. I use this as a reference book for everything from doors stuff to reading lists! It's always at my fingertips. If you wanna know the story behind Jim's poetry/songs... get this book!"
1,I thought this book was tasteless.,"When I read this book, I could barely stand to finish it. For one, I do not enjoy constant swearing in children's books. I think that the subject of this book is not for children, either. I would never make a child read this book. It is, in points, crass and vulgar."
5,"""Caitlyn Jackson"" will touch you","When I read this book in 1997, I didn't know that I'd still be thinking about it 2 years later. The story is a powerful one. Will their mother return? And, if not, will Caitlyn be able to handle it? This book is a real page turner that will keep you reading all night (and thinking about it for a long time). Definitely a must read!!!"
2,Alright...but....,"This is not the greatest CD on the planet. It isn't even the best by Slick Shoes. I liked Wake Up Screaming, even though that was rather poppy, but this CD is just a joke compared to that one. For some reason it just sounds different, and I like their newer sound better. It just doesn't stand out as being a great CD. If you're a big fan of Slick Shoes and must have it, then go ahead and buy this CD, but if you're just looking for some new music, to try a different band, look elsewhere."
1,Borrrrrrrrrrrrring,"The least interesting thing about this book is the author. Unfortunately, this is an autobiography. Considering CBS Records' remarkable talent roster during Yetnikoff's tenure, including the Stones, Springsteen, Dylan and Michael Jackson, he recounts only a few rather uninteresting anecdotes about Wacko Jacko, and virtually nothing about the others, instead taking gratuitous potshots at former close associates. Even if you enjoy books about bitter, washed up, egotisical, former drunken cokehead lawyers, this book will put you to sleep. I'm sure there's a very interesting story somewhere in Walter Yetnikoff's experience with CBS. It's not in this book."
4,Put Your Seatbelts On !,"This is a fascinating book. If you are interested in learning more on the characters of the A List celebrities, including Mick Jagger & Michael Jackson to name but a few, then buy this book. Walter Yetnikoff does not come across as a nice guy, but he does come across honestly. Beware, there are a few fairly explicit details in this book, & if you are comfortable with reading such details, then I recommend this book. This is real fast lane stuff !"
3,a fun read,informative about the music industry and its multitude of over-indulgences. However it was not as thorough as it advertised itself to be. A lot of skipping around.
3,Loud and gets hot,We use this vac to clean up commercial printers at work.Pros: does what ist is supposed to do. Great at picking toner. Although does not pick 100% of it. Very minute amounts still get through. Metal construction. Very sturdyCons: it is loud and gets really hot after a while.
3,"A good, general overview of the Druid culture.",This is a good book for some one with little to no knowlage of Druidism. The author is overly verbose at times but He does give some insight to Druid culture and belief
1,The Druids,"Tim Warren's review echoes my reaction. This an overly assertive and very speculative book. The bias toward Celtic civilization and culture becomes quite grating after a short time, even for a reader who is in sympathy with it, and this along with Mr. Ellis's sometimes questionable leaps of reasoning serves to undermine the reader's confidence. The book is well- researched and not without merit but seems to come a little short in the authority department."
2,Misses both the general reader and the historian,"To defend his lack of academic documentation in the book, Peter Berresford Ellis claims he writes for the ""general reader,"" not the historian. I'll leave it to the other reviewers to explain how Ellis's book disappoints historians, but as a general reader I feel qualified to say it disappoints me. Here's why:1) The book's writing style is a lengthy listing of names and places with minimal transition or elaboration to string them together meaningfully. For a general reader, Ellis makes a fascinating subject tedious to follow.2) Some of the arguments Ellis makes are weakly supported and, frankly, appear unobjective. In a tone that crosses to sarcasm, he attacks several sources as pro-Roman (i.e. untrustworthy) without explaining his evidence thoroughly."
3,Scholarly and detailed book,"This book is filled with details of Celtic history; Ellis cites many ancient documents. I am keeping the book on the shelf mainly for reference, because of the large number of personalities and facts he mentions. However, it is very boring to read this book from cover to cover. It really is more of a reference book."
2,"Druids, and what makes you an expert?","I have to agree with Tim Warren on this book. Whilst it may have the cloak of a non-ficiton historical analysis, it certainly lacks the substance of one. As I teach about this subject I have to say, it was novice level at best.Some of the references made were mis-quoted and taken out of context as well. This text appears to take a modern journalistic approach to what and who druids are, rather than the culturally relative anthropological approach needed to study a people so integrated with their society.The author also makes a totally unprofessional, and quite frankly, silly stab at people who are following modern druidic practices. He apparently has given no real study to them either, as personally I find them very down to earth and often in the positions of power associated with their ancient counterparts.A shoddy attempt at historical analysis. Better luck next time..."
5,Absolute must!!,"I bought this gift for a friend of mine for her birthday and have decided to keep the book and buy another one for her. This is a wonderful, descriptive book. It's filled with tips and pictures. I'm the type of person that wants to see what something looks like and every page has at least one picture. It tells you what type of pots are good for what, gives you tips if you are using oil, broth, sauces, ... I think this is a wonderful book. I don't think you will be disappointed with this purchase. We were going to give my friend our fondue kit, but after reading this book, we are now keeping it and will be getting her a new one. (Smile)"
2,Not practical for a novice cook,"I ordered this book after reading a customer review stating it had lots of background information on selecting a fondue pot and preparing oils and broths, as well as lots of pictures. That's defintiely true. But MOST of these recipes require tools I don't have, or such strange cheeses or seasonings I have NO idea where I would find them. I was hoping to make something for my husband for Valentine's Day - there are about 3 recipes that look appealing ot me, after browsing the recipes for the past hour. Very frustrating."
1,"""New"" dead batteries","I recently bought 3 new batteries for my cell phone and all of them go dead after less than 5 minutes of conversation. It's not the phone because the old battery lasts for days. I just got ripped off by Amazon. The vender sent me defective batteries without any contact info like a phone number or email address to contact. Very frustrating experience. The same thing happened in July with 2 ""new"" batteries that went dead in minutes. Guess I will be shopping elsewhere in the future."
1,Nothing Is Quite Right,"I paid a premium for high capacity batteries. What I got was the low capacity batteries. No amount of emails changed anything. I paid my money, and I did not get what I paid for. My advice, avoid this bunch."
1,oops,"Never read a Danielle Steele before, but I was trapped on vacation without any other reading material, so what the heck, I'll try anything once. The best I can say is it took less than three hours to read. Other than that, I just don't get it. Bland characters, overused plots, stilted dialoque, unbelievable coincidences and absolutely nothing new. Okay, some might say it's ""chick lit"", but I have much more respect for women readers than that. Simply put, ""Ransom"" was awful. I don't get how Steele is such a popular author, or have I just hit it when she has lost her gifts, the literary equvilant of ""jumping the shark."""
2,Predictable and Forgettable,"As a first-time reader of a Dnielle Steele novel, I'd read that 'Ransom' was supposed to be a departure for her, into more 'action thriller' territory, rathe than romantic fiction.She may want to re-think that career move!'Ransom' has almost nothing going for it; the characters are one-dimensional, their dialogue vapid, their actions, at times, ridiculous.The book suffers from an overload of exposition, introducing each character in the most long-winded way possible, and taking forever to get the plot moving. As others mentioned, there are some editing errors, leading to stilted sentences and paragraphs. Steele goes 'comma-happy' at times, as well.Save yourself the time, and money, and just read the spoiler-laden blurb on the inside of the back cover."
4,Nice change of pace - high-adrenaline action and suspense,"This is one of DS' more exciting novels, as far as a high level of action, drama and suspense. The characters were really interesting, especially the bad guys. I have only one complaint: after taking the reader through a frantic, exciting and heart-stopping 300 pages, the high moment of the book is recapped after it happens, explained by another character! What was the point of writing this really neat, enjoyable book, only to cheat the reader out of the best part of the story? After walking beside this character for 300 pages, I wanted to see the end of the story through his point of view.Other than that, it was a good book to read, enjoyable, a diversion for Steel as an author from romance to thriller."
3,Ransom,"Peter Morgan just got released from prison after doing time for drug charges. He is a decent and attractive man, but is not able to find a job now because of his record. To earn money, he becomes involved in a plot to kidnap Fernanda Barnes's children to earn money from the ransom. At one time, Fernanda was married to a billionaire and was very rich. Recently her husband was killed (probably suicide) when he found out that he was bankrupt. The story covers the planning and kidnapping of one of the Barnes children. As always, it has a happy and meaningful ending, although this is not one of my favorite Danielle Steel novels."
2,A bit frustrating ....,"Ransom is the first Danielle Steel novel I've read in a long time, and though I finished it, I don't think I'll be looking for any more.The plot itself was great - it is an intrigueing tale with many possibilities and likable characters. But reading it became so tedious... she is so very repititious, and her writing seemed to be geared toward elementary-aged children. I also found myself wondering about her editor, as another reviewer here did. I would find myself frustrated with her never-ending descriptions of the characters' feelings, and then had to hear most of them all over again.All in all, it was very handy when I was in bed and wanted to get sleepy!"
1,I stopped at page 189,"Page 189, line 9: ""Even to her, it sounded like a bad movie"". This was the exact feeling I had, and I gave up on it. Bad writing, repetitions over repetitions over repetitions, bad story. My first, and last Danielle Steel."
2,"Attention, Editor!","In this book, the lives of four people intersect and are woven together. The initial descriptions of the four people--two recently released convicts, a woman whose husband has committed suicide, and a police officer--are interesting and promise an intriguing story. Unfortunately, the book goes downhill from there. The characters are manipulated in an artificial manner, and the interactions are forced and wooden. I agree that the writing is surprisingly amateurish at times and a good editor would have caught the awkward phrasing and helped improve it. This is not Danielle Steele's best work!"
4,A step up,"Steele threw in a little more action than usual. There were a lot of parts where I couldn't put the book down. The beginning was a little drawn out, especially when the guys get out of prison and are re-introduced to the real world, blah, blah, blah. The end was fairly predictable.My only Steele peeve is that she descbibes characters personalities over and over and over! Besides that I really liked Fernanda and all of the characters for that matter.If the average Seele read is a 5 this one is a 6."
1,"Could be a nice buy, but I'll never know...","I ordered the jacket pictured, but I received an entirely different Bernardo jacket. Customer service re-ordered for me and I got the same incorrect jacket. I wouldn't bother ordering this unless customer service assures you that their inventory glitch has been corrected."
1,I don't love this blazer!!!!,You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!!I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it .......
1,"waste of money, don't bother",Overpriced! Not what I expected! You can't really used it because it's too small for big bellied pregnant women! Uncomfortable! The velcro gets in the way of sleeping comfy. YUCk!
2,poorly designed lock,poorly designed lock and only two screws close to each other so this lock can not be fixed tightly to the door
3,A few great songs,This album deffinant has a few oustanding songs. It is worth listening to. Brian Free has such a smooth voice.
4,Want to learn this language,"I would like to have this book, if possible. Please send me this book i need it for my students."
1,ribbon replacements,"the printer cartridges all leaked over my hands, counter,and printer machine. Will not buy again. Very unhappy with purchase and doing this survey."
1,No batteries,"Coleman has discontinued this product and if your battery happens to work now, it won't in a year or two. There are no replacement batteries ANYWHERE. DON'T buy this product!"
5,Best paring knife,"This knife incorporates Japanese blade geometry (thin angel) with a western style handle (comfortable). Add the HRC 66 steel core and you have a superior cutting knife. This knife as it arrives from the factory will cut, ... say carrots with about half the effort of common brand name knifes. My only pause in recommending this knife to everybody would be the buyers ability to sharpen their knifes. Using the wrong sharpening technique will adversely change the profile and lower the cutting performance back down to average."
4,Nice responsive controller,"I have had this for a few months now and it is great. I have changed the batteries twice so far. The sleep function is very handy, it probably has saved me a ton on batteries. It works as well or better than the standard wired controller."
4,Great wireless controller,My son really likes this wireless controller. He thinks it's great to move around the room and not get tangled up or unplugging it form the console. He's said he could play on the other side of the wall if he could see the TV. I can't say how long the batteries work because he use rechargeables.
1,Don't Waste Your Time On This Book !,"I can't comment on the whole book, because I only got a few chapters into it. I have read a few other books on Buddhism, so I know a little about the subject. This book is hard to follow, the stupid remarks are annoying, and I think I found some grammer errors."
3,Not bad at all,"Being a very new follower of Buddhism, I can only review this from a the approach of a novice. Having said that - it left me feeling a little...empty. Although Gach really does bring together some of the key concepts of Buddhism, he never seems to take the time or effort to explain the more indepth ideas and concepts that are so vital, even to a novice reader.Topics (somewhat lightly) discussed include:Vipassana, Tibetan, Pure Land and Zen BuddhismFour Noble Truths and Eightfold PathBuddhism in America todayCompassion and overcoming angerObviously this doesn't give a concise list of the material covered, but quite honestly, the book doesn't really touch on much else.It's not all bad - to a complete beginner, it would at least bring forth some of the key concepts of Buddhism - but even new readers are well advised to pick up other books, such as Thich Nhat Hanh's The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching, or perhaps one of The Dalai Lama's many texts."
5,i loved this book,"I really liked this book-i had many questions about budhism and the marjority of them were answered. i have read a few other books concerning the topic, though this was by far the best. i really liked the way it was layed out and everything was so easy to find!i recommend this book for people who are interested in the basic concepts of budhism, or a more in depth research subject."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Buddhism,"This book is definitely not for idiots, but very nicely written. It is a thoughtful, thorough guide to Buddhism whether one is interested in following a spiritual path or just wanting to know more about the subject....I think it is the book to read!"
3,Pretty Good for a Beginner,"I wanted to get a basic idea of what Buddhism is about. I read this book with absolutely no prior knowledge of Buddism. It is a good starter book, going through the basic principles. I enjoyed reading it for the most part.I didn't like the silly jokes, however. They just didn't seem appriopriate to the content. Perhaps that is just how the Idiot's Guides are.. I haven't read too many of them. So I'd give this book 3 stars... it has it's good points and it's bad. I am glad I got it, and will look for some other books which I may like better."
5,Still the best at-home exercise program on earth!! Wish it was on dvd.,What Jane knew back in the 80's and 90's still applies today. She and her team are easy and enjoyable to work along with. They target all the important areas we all want to work on. It is funny to see all their hair styles and workout clothes. I had great success with this program in the 90's so I wanted to go back to it and found my vhs tape was warped. Glad to find another one. Now if only it would be reproduced on dvd.
5,I LOVE this video!!! You Go Jane!!!,"I was lucky enough to borrow this video from my local library. I absolutely LOVE the aerobics portion of the tape--even the music was enjoyable. Very upbeat with great instructors and simple moves to match! This was wonderful for me, because I am not a dancer or very well coordinated. I thought I'd miss not seeing Jane in the first section, but I didn't. The floor work was wonderfully executed as well; although extremely challenging for anyone on a beginner's level. I am very pleased, and would highly recommend this tape to anyone."
2,Not impressed,"Had to buy this book for 3 semesters of introductory French. Layout is confusing and unnecessarily cluttered. One has to constantly flip to the back of the book for tables of verbs, nouns, etc. Too much reliance on the online-based material makes the book feel superfluous at times. Couldn't wait to sell this thing to the college book store!"
3,Nothing Special,"I used this textbook for my French 103 class. It's nothing special. In my opinion, the book is very unorganised."
3,Cheap French book,I bought this because it was the cheapest French book I could find... I needed to brush up on some French before jumping into French IV in college.
4,Very African,"The inductive grammar philosophy that apparently guided the writing of this book is good, but the listening and reading input sections are heavily biased toward French-speaking Africa. It's as if the authors were determined to convince beginning French students that Africa is the only interesting place French is spoken anymore."
5,Finally found it.,I've been looking for this book and I'm now glad to have in my library. I feel I can start construction of my own craft with the information this book contains.
2,"For a very beginner, a bit disappointed","My husband and I are just beginning dance lessons at Arthur Murray and wanted a book/dvd to supplement our at home practise. Unfortunately, without step diagrams, I find it hard to look up the appropriate chapter and pick up where my lessons at Arthur Murray left off for the week. This book might be alright for a book you really wanted to read from the beginning, but to use it as a beginner's reference guide it was terribly hard for us to follow. I am looking for that book with foot diagrams, I think. As to the DVD, it might be great, but the book was designed to hold the DVD with a little glue in the back of the book, which in my book came unglued somewhere along the way before I ever even tried to watch it. As such, the DVD is missing. I'm hoping to find where it perhaps fell out, but am not holding my breath. You would think for a book this expensive they could have created a little better storage space for the DVD slot."
1,don't buy from The Factory Depot,"I purchased a replacement photoconductor unit on March 30,2011. It's supposed to yield over 15,000 pages. I'm a one person office and have barely used it (I've maybe used 2 reams of paper, and this was mostly black & white), and it's already defective. The unit that came with the printer lasted considerable longer.In addition, when I tried to call The Factory Depot with the number provided both on Amazon and on their website, it doesn't work. I absolutely wouldn't buy from this company."
3,Just a note reviewers probably didn't know,"I wrote one of the stories in the anthology, and I can report that at least *some* of the problems with inaccuracy in, say, knowing the correct form to use when describing Crinos, is due to a global search and replace gone horribly awry.The terms Homid, homid and human all meant different things at the time of 1st edition Werewolf. But a global search and replace was done that turned all instances of ""homid"" into ""human."" Since Homids are most certainly not human and a Red Claw can take homid form, you can imagine how much problem this caused.There may have been other editing errors-- this is the one I noticed in my own story."
3,Werewolf short stories vaguely resembling the game,"Some of these stories were interesting ideas for Storytellers. However, most of them were plagued by either innaccurate information (i.e., they contradicted the game rules) or bad writing. Many of them were unoriginal as well. However, the occasional gem made the book worthwhile...barely."
4,A rather grim anthology about werewolves.,"Based on the popular role-play game by White Wolf Publishing, ""When Will You Rage"" is a dark, tragic and sometimes gory collection of stories about a race of werewolves (""garou"") who had been sent by Gaia, the Mother of the Earth, to protect the planet from the insidious forces of pure evil, or the Wyrm. Not only do they face corrupted werewolves, known as ""Black Spiral Dancers"", but they also face corporations behind whom lurks the Wyrm and his minions, and who use their profits and influence to further the cause of evil. Many of the stories are filled with gratuitous violence, but others make a point of showing our foibles and follies through the eyes of those that actually look for them. A good read."
2,Very disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this book, and was extremely disappointed when I read it. It is quite obvious that many of the authors know nothing about the Werewolf universe or the World of Darkness (examples: one refers to the full moon as the Trixter moon; others continually have Garou calling the Crinos form ""the wolfman form""; etc.) A few of the stories got WAY too preachy, trying desperately to convince the reader that some event or attitude towards things was a crime against humanity or some such.One or two stories out of the lot made the book bearable, but I definitely don't recommend spending your money on this one."
3,Cute,"This book was cute. It won't win any literary awards, but is was entertaining in a Janet Evanovich kind of way. I would compare the main character Reyn Marten Sawyer with Stephanie Plum, although I think Reyn is a little smarter and not as inept. She's also not as funny, either. One note: this was my first time reading an e-book, and there were many grammatical and spelling errors. If your interested in reading this book, I would suggest the paperpack edition."
1,Dull,"I very seldom do not finish a book...especially a mystery...however, I decided this was one to 'pass on to the thrift store'!I really did not care what happened...even after reading several chapters."
5,The Brush-Off: A Hair-raising Mystery,"After reading poor reviews, I decided to read it anyway. Boy, am I glad I did! I love this series and can't wait for the next one!"
4,Fine Scottish Fiddlin,"The blurb on the outer cover was this quote: ""Blazin Fiddles is the Led Zepplin of Scottish music.""Well, I'm sold! When I listened to the cd I came up to this conclusion. The guy who said that quote must drink. A lot.I was expecting the raw power of Led Zepplin. That's not to say the album isn't good. It's just really. . . polished. (That could be what the reviewer was getting at). The musicians have excellent technique and really capture the feel of the Scottish fiddle. Their tune choices are nothing short of outstanding. A great mix of jigs, reels, airs, and strathspeys. They definitely didn't re-hash tired old standards. The guitar and sometime piano accompaniment added to the full sound without detracting from the whole. The production is very slick and arranged and there are glimpses of the wildness of Scots music peeking through here and there. The cd is very good and well worth buying. I was expecting something with a little more fire and a little less orchestration."
2,Okay,My bf ordered this cage to keep at his house for the days I came to spend the night that way I can stay longer if I have my parrot with me. I don't really like it that much. My parrot has a hard time coming out with the way it's door is. The door doesn't stay open. It's not that sturdy. Seems a little on the cheap side. I wouldn't buy this or recommend it to anyone. My bf only got it because it was the cheapest one he found.
1,Bird cage did not come,I would rare it a zero if that was an option. No one has contacted me to tell me why it is not here
3,it's okay,"it isn't the best cage, but it works. The metal is coated and keeps my bird in, but it just snaps together and if you really hit it with something (ie, a person) it could come apart. i took the little shelf off of the bottom and the legs came out from under it. the cage can't really support itself without it. it is easy to clean for the most part and the big door is nice and latches well enough.it isn't the highest quality, but it works for my tiny little meyers parrot. i would say it would be okay for a conure or another small bird like that. Honestly, i wish now i had forked out another 100 bucks or so and gotten a nice well made cage. but i was broke at the time, and now have a hard time throwing away this, functional cage.it works. not the best, but it hasn't killed my bird."
3,rickety and had to use coated ties to hold it together,"Well I got this as a gift and when I started putting it together I started seeing how poorly this cage is made . Had I had to pay for it , it certainly would have been returned . I had to collect up my share of bread ties (yes I save these just in case anything comes apart and I need an emergency tie up ) and tie some pieces of the cage together . I am happy with the size and the height of the cage . I would not put any bird bigger than a meyers or a senegal or a nanday in it . I was also impressed with the size of the perches and the feed cups . Would I recommend it to anyone ? Im not sure ."
3,Bird Cage Review,"It came in quick, but it was smaller than I thought it would be and it had no instructions to put it together. It is heavy duty and sturdy. It is attractive also, which is what I wanted for my kitchen."
3,Parrot bird cage,"While good for the money, I think I would have spent a bit more on a more stable unit. The thing always looks lopsided, but the bird likes it, I guess. It was a plus having the rolling bottom...."
4,I liked it but...,"Well, I looked forward to this book, and when I got through, I had mixed feelings. Though I felt that Jan was assertive and all, I also felt that she allowed stuff to go down that was unnecessary. I was ticked with her parents. The daddy got the mamma on a dare and married her. But wasn't one step of educated if he tried to be, and because of the conflict between them, they didn't have time for Jan. When she really needed these people, they wasn't there for her,and in retrospect, she turned to others such as her aunt,Don and her girlfriend, who really should have a book of her own. It was good at times, but then it was like feeling in the dark for where you were. Other than that, it was good."
1,No bueno,"Contrary to the reading on this thermometer, my aquarium is not always 90+ degrees. Everything would be dead if that were the case. What a rip off!"
5,Vintage look,I had one of these when I was in fifth grade in the early eighties and setting up my first aquarium; it looks exactly the same as back then. A break from the glass tube sort of thermometers.The position of the clip on this thermometer interfered with my aquarium hood so I took the clip up top and bent it around backwards so the thermometer hangs in the background of my aquarium instead of the foreground.
4,good old fashioned reliable thermometer,I use it to measure room temperature rather than the aquarium. I've used a few over my 26 years of fish keeping.
3,a bit disappointed,"I should have known it's too cheap to be good. The stainless steel is flimsy. Another reason I was disappointed was partially my fault. I should have looked at the picture closer. It's not a suction thermometer as I thought it was. Instead it's a hook thingy that hangs off the side of the tank. I should have spent a little bit more money and bought something better. But if you're just looking for a thermometer and don't mind the hanging and flimsy steel part, it does its job."
5,Does what it should!,"I bought this thermometer to test the temperature of my water before refilling during the weekly 50% water change, it works perfectly!"
4,Not for shredders,"The toy is great for dogs that don't ""shred"" other rope toys. My lab mix usually takes traditional rope toys, chews on them, then rips out the string piece by piece. This ""shredding"" process was repeated on this toy and while it held up to the chewing (did not puncture), him ripping the toy did not end so well. He quickly ripped off the end pieces and ripped apart the middle parts of the toy. Great for other dogs that aren't as determined to shred though! On a final note, my dog does seem to like this toy more than other rope toys."
3,Not for Aggressive Chewer,"My two dobes love them, but they are destroyed in a few hours. I have to watch them so they do not eat this."
5,Great toy,"I have a standard poodle that loves to play with just about everything, these ""rags"" as we call them are among his favorite. He has several sizes, short, long, some with loops. All you have to say is""go get your rags"" and off he goes coming back with one of them. They are very strong, and yet soft. He just loves them."
3,Not quite for the beginner,"While the preface and first chapter of this book do a good job of simply explaining the terms used in statistics, I find that the authors needed to spend more time fleshing out the concepts. I've been looking for a statistics book that focuses on ecology and the environment, and I believe this one can be it; I would like to have seen different scenarios used in the examples, rather than one scenario, then a rapid shuffle forward to the next example. A good one to add to a statistics course, or to discuss in a class setting...or even with someone who knows statistics inside-out."
4,A ripping yarn,Book arrive promptly and in excellent condition. It covers statisitcs for field ecologists in a clear and conscise manner. Worth the money.
5,Deadwood Rocks!,"The best TV series I have ever watched! I purchaed the series and have loaned it to many friends who also loved it. Not for the weak or sensitive due to the foul language, but truly brillant and wonderful!!! The only bad thing about this series is that it ended!"
2,Very poor product,It does not display the correct temperature. The suction cup also does not stay attached to the tank for longer that a day or two at a time.
3,Good for price,i havent used this yet but got it on time and is what it was suppose to be. the blades doesent seem to be that sharp though. i think i can sharpen it up. the bone saw seems to be just the right size.
2,"Lil' Bratz Bus, expensive and flimsy","I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. It was on sale for half off or I never would have paid that much for it. The Lil' Bratz dolls are difficult to dress because they are so small and the clothes are tight. We have the Lil' Bratz Loungin' Loft, also. The furniture is a joke. They're flimsy plastic pieces that don't stay together very well. This was bought very cheap at a store ""doorbuster"" sale. I wouldn't have purchased it at the regular price. (I wouldn't have bought it at all if I'd known how flimsy the pieces are.) I must say I am highly disappointed the Bratz collection. VERY pricey and VERY flimsy. I'm afraid Mattel's Barbie and Polly Pockets have it over these products all the way!! I will not purchase anymore Bratz products."
2,"Cute Idea, but very poor quality","My 6 year old daughter got this for her birthday a few days ago and I had high expectations for it because of the Bratz name and price, but was very disappointed when we opened it. It is a very cute concept, but very poorly designed and very poor quality. The doors don&#146;t stay on, don&#146;t stay closed and the van is just constantly falling apart. I gave my daughter the option to exchange it for something else, but because it had the Bratz name on it she didn&#146;t want to. I just don&#146;t like the fact that they use the Bratz name to sell low quality, poorly built toys at such high prices."
2,Girls VS Boys,"Why is this vehicle about 3 times the price of a similar vehicle sold in the boy's sections of toy aisles? Is it because of the tiny plastic junk that kids immediately lose that comes with it, or the brand name on it? My daughter wants to play with ""cars"" but the other little girls make fun of her for it. I thought buying a ""girls"" car would help her socially while allowing her to pursue her interests, but I don't understand why the ""pink"" aisles (Go stand at the end and look down them) have to charge at least twice as much for the same quality."
1,cheep,this was so bad. first it was shiped twice w/ missing parts and whin I finly got 1 whith all the parts it barly holds together . it may not have cost much but it wasnt even worth it. my bird can barly use it . it keeps trying to fall apart. I just hope it holds untill I can get something else.
2,missing piece,"i ordered this product because i wanted an extra feeder and an extra waterer for my finches. the item was shipped, SEVERAL TIMES, without the necessary piece to attach it to the cage. that may be a problem with Amazon's shipping? unsure, but i was sent a replacement the second time i received the feeder w/out the attachment piece, and it STILL WAS MISSING THE ATTACHMENT PIECE (the first time it arrived w/out the attachment piece, i did not file a claim). i finally received one with the necessary piece to attach to attach it to the cage:)"
1,clean cup feeder,"the imagage of the bird feeder looked bigger than it seems. i am not happy with it, and both my parakeets will not eat the food from it. they can barily get their heads into get the food."
3,Clean cup feed dish,I was hoping this would stop the millet mess but it is not working like I thought it would. I maybe should have gotten the medium size instead of the small size.
3,Background Bubbles,"Yes, it's well done, but it doesn't really shine. The only song that really grabs me on this one is Air Batucada. The rest of it is good music for the beginning of a party, or for reading to. No, that's not a glowing recommendation. Not a waste of money, but they really have to either pick up the beat once or twice, get some really interesting textures instead of that bland beat, or find some EMOTION!"
2,...actually...maybe...maybe...NAAH!!,"...i'm really just getting into ""downtempo"" music, so i'm kinda new with this, but damn! i dont wanna ever fall asleep while driving again!! every song starts off potentially great, but does ""downtempo"" mean ""repetitious"", also? if you want to really, really, really relax then this cd will definitely do it...and i might play it again one day soon, but not by myself. some company is definitely required if you plan on doing anything else besides taking a nap. ON THE PLUS SIDE, HOWEVER: the songs that have vocals are pretty good, if the majority of the album was like this i mighta gave it closer to 4-stars."
