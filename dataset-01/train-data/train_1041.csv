3,Pretty Hot,"I bought this tape in 93' to play in an assembly at out junior high for a classmate who was killed. Gangsta Lean was the only single I remember beng released, but in general this had to be the most refreshing gangsta music of that era because these guys could really harmonize as well as rap. Since it was released nearly 13 years ago, of course a lot of the songs sound dated, but there is definitely that west coast feel that makes you want to pop it in, blaze up and dream of back in the day. I can't help but wonder if D.R.S paved the way for the likes of Y?NVEE, or Montell Jordan because of the g-funked out west coast R&B, but this is definately worth copping. Oh yea...TQ was not a member of D.R.S, he was a member of R&B quartet Coming of Age."
5,D.R.S IS OFF THE HOOK,"THIS ALBUM IS OFF THE HOOK, IF YOU LIKE HARDCORE GANGSTA RAP THIS ALBUM IS FOR YOU. BUY IT TODAY."
1,I wish I could enjoy it,"I ordered this item over a month ago. The one song that I love is awesome, but I can't enjoy the rest. Hopefully i don't have to wait another month to recieve."
4,"I love this, it is good and nasty!!","I first heard this cd back in the mid-90's when DRS had their big hit, ""Gangsta Lean."" That is a great song, but believe it or not, the rest of the DRS cd is even better! For several years, I could not find this cd anywhere! I actually had to special order it from Best Buy. It was worth it though. ""Strip,"" ""Mama Didn't Raise no Punk,"" ""I've Got that Sickness"" and the very best of all, ""Make it Rough,"" are all great tracks. I am disapointed that DRS never had a second album. These guys could rap and sing, but with a west-coast flavor unlike Bone Thugs. As a matter of fact, I have often wondered if one of the members of DRS is none other than the rapper T.Q???"
3,THE UNDER-RATED MASTER,"What a pleasant surprise! The pitch of Taylors books is usually dead center between the opaqueness of Ramsey Campbell and the not-so-subtle style of Stephen King, and ""Chamed Life"" is no exception!The story revolves around Guy Holman, a man who was fated to die several times but inexplicably escaped; we learn that two very different groups of people are interested in his death or survival because of the impact his dying would have on the future.As fantastic as it all sounds, it's actually a wonderfully suspenceful book that brilliantly weaves two or three stories together at once.Why isn't this author more successful?"
5,Good speaker for the price.,"This is a good speaker, especially for the price. It is a bit larger, than the other speakers in it's category."
4,RDC: he Budd Rail Diesel Car.,"This is a fine book! Well written and with many good photos. I sent Edmund Keilty a 10/10 B&W print of an RDC being loaded on a ship in 1951, bound for Australia and was most pleased to see that photo in the book. I have the books on ""doodlebugs"" by Mr Keilty, and I fully recommend all of the books in the Rail Motor Car, series."
2,Immature,"A Crack Up at the Race Riots is the work of an immaturewriter. I am a big fan of Korine's film work but he fails to succeedin effectively recreating his film style on paper. The book is uninteresting because it aims to upset the reader but is neither original or intelligent enough to do so. It is scatological in a very uninteresting and highschool manner ... The non-linear framework is not innovative as he didn't create the concept and definitely not effective as there is no focus whatsoever, just immature scriblings that any malcontent 16 year old could create. A disappointment from a very talented film maker."
4,the random beauty of all things surreal in korine's new book,"Crack up at the race riots is a whole lotta non linear fiction. I like it. Reminds me of those strange fragmented dreams we all have. Where you wake up trying to remember and all you get are disjointed details. Don't expect a true novel with this book, it is essentially an interesting collage of surreal images, thoughts, and aphorisms. A nice book to be left on the coffee table at your grandma's house."
3,???????????,"I haven't read all of Harmony's book, but I have seen his avant-garde, trash art film, ""GUMMO"". It's very hard to put this film in a catagory, but if you're interested in people that murder cats, go on glue binges, tape bacon to the wall, put electrical tape on their nipples, and eat spaggetti in the bath tub, then this movie is for you. (Definantly not for every movie taste.) The movie's website has a very good interview with the author, and you can read more about the movie itself. END"
3,a mixed bag,"A crack up at the race riots has scenes which cause your to break out in a snearing smile. Mr. Korine's snippets are ironic and clever (except for when they are pointless). However that is all they are, snippets. Reading this book is like getting a peek at someone's personal thought notebook. It's random, dissorganized, and generally pointless, but it's interesting. If there is any over-riding theme to the book, it's probably the triteness of everyday life (or situations). It kind of has the same mood as Ellis' less than zero. Korine has promise. Maybe if he organizes his little stories, he become a literary force. However, until then his books will remain a mixed bag."
4,For that Special Sense of Humor,"At first flip through this novel I was wondering what the hell it was. Cut and paste passages, pages with one or two words on them, random sections of dialogue.. I started reading anyway and next thing I know I'm rolling on the floor laughing. Harmony has a sense of humor that you either get or feel completely alienated by. His writing is smart. He plays around with and distorts pop references. He has a keen sense of white trash culture. This novel has sex, drugs, life, death, rock 'n roll (metal), and MC Hammer. It's got it all for the reader with a cynical eye on popular culture. First half is better than the last, but it's all good. Uh huh."
3,Funny at times....,".....stale at others. Korine is a great writer of movies. He knows what he wants to see and he captures it (Gummo, Julien donkey-boy). When it comes to this book, he is hit & miss. The tasteless jokes are great and so are fictionalized stories of celebrity lives, but I'd say only half of these tales work in print. Korine needs a camera to get the images in his head across to his audience. For now, this is a funny toilet read. Give us another movie, Harmony."
4,Wow! Wow! Wow!,"I thought this was a very good book. Korine has such a wild imagination that contains so much realism that you actually say to yourself ""Is this for real?"" I totally loved it."
1,this is the worst movie ever...,I had an old tape (for VCR) of this movie and my nephew LOVED it--so of course I had to buy him the DVD as they do not have a VCR. It is torture sitting through this movie--but he is 4 years old and loved it so....as a dutiful aunt it was my job to buy it for him. Movie arrived in a timely manner and was cheap so I'd purchase from them again--I just wouldn't purchase this movie!
2,High Price - Low Quality,"This is exactly the kind of video that gives instructional videos a bad name. The recording is so bad that the techniques are hard to see even on a fairly large video screen. The instruction is limited in value and often pooly synchronized with the action. I think Bob Klein is probably a great instructor, but this video tape does not let us enjoy the quality of his instruction.Save your money. This tape is not a good buy for the money."
2,Don't buy this unless you are taking lessons,"This DVD would probably be useful to someone who is taking lessons, but it would be of no value to someone who is trying to learn the form on his or her own. It has commentary that briefly describes each move as the form is being demonstrated, but it does not provide useful instruction on how to perform each move. And, it was filmed outdoors in bright sunlight with much vegetation in the background, and this often makes it impossible to see the position of the blade."
1,DVD wouldnt play.,"Buy at your own risk... the copy I bought did not play in any of my DVD players... (2 units and a PlayStation 2). I did not send it back and am not bothering to, as I ordered this and ""Taiji Sword, Classical Yang Style (YMAA Tai Chi)"" which was flawless as an instructional DVD. I'm sure the content is fine... and it couldve worked out the other way, but from the packaging and the look of the DVD media, I suspect I'm not the first to have this issue."
1,RIP-OFF DO NOT BUY!!,"The list price shows $44.90, the shipping weight shows 4.4 pounds, even a previous review mentioned getting a whole display box of these 7oz packages, so that's what I assumed I was getting...Not true! I paid $4.79 + $5.99 shipping for ONE 7oz pack.... I could have purchased these at the grocery store for about the same price, and I wouldn't have had to wait for them to ship. The product by Pedigree is great, my dog loves them, and she has the best doggy breath around, and her teeth are always clean. I recommend the product itself, but purchase it elsewhere because PetCo will rip you off."
4,The vaccine war,"America's conversation about vaccines is complex, involving not only medical risks and benefits but also ideological beliefs about parental choice and the limits of government. It's also culturally interesting that the ""medical and public health establishment"" is treated with such skepticism by the broader public, and how the emotionally charged activism of non-experts (parents, celebrities, politicians) is competing with - and largely winning against - the dry and logical thinking of experts.P.S. - All Frontline programs are available for free online, including this one. There is a Wikipedia page (""List of Frontline (PBS) episodes"") with links to and brief descriptions of each."
5,Greatest Mother GBoose Ever,"The music is by Hershey Kay, orchestrator of Gottschalk and many other things, and the actors are just superlative. Cyril Ritchard is the quintessence of wit; Celeste Holme I last heard as Dona Ana in Shaw's DON JUAN IN HELL. You know Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster--imagine him ominously reciting ""There was a crooked man,"" without ever showing you that he has his tongue in his cheek. Now imagine him singing ""A Frog He Would A-wooing Go,"" or pleading with Mrs. Bond's recalcitrant ducks to come out of the pond and be killed for dinner. The familiar and unfamiliar are both included, and because of the talent and intelligence of the participants, the result is simply delicious. I wish the publisher would re-issue it as a CD, but I'm grateful they haven't let it go out of print."
3,Jacob Two-Two review,"I don't really like this book because at the end of the story, you'll find out that it's all just a dream. Its very disappointing because the storyline is very clever and the setting is very well portrayed. This is a good adventure/fantasy book which I would recommend to readers 7 or above."
5,Movie?,"I've never read Mordecai Richler's book Jacob Two-Two, but I have seen the movie. Not the one made in the late '90s but the one from the '80s. It really freaked me out as a kid and now I can't find anywhere to buy it online. If anyone else remembers this movie or know where to find it please email me.Thanks"
5,We love Jacob Two-Two!,"Great book! i found this book at a thrift store and bought it for our son, he was 10 at the time. we actually read this one outloud as a family and EVERYONE enjoyed it! the story conveys a wonderful message about the strength of children and the importance of them being heard and understood, and treated fairly. We recommend this book whole-heartedly!"
5,Everything Two Times,"Jacob Two Two is ignored the first time, so he says itagain. One day he gets yelled at by green grocer. Running home he runshimself into more trouble By going to "" SLIMERS ISLAND WHERE NO BRATS RETURN"". I think you'll enjoy this book I give it 5 stars. If you want to know more you have to read the book yourself."
3,Not the Original,"While ""Windy"" and ""Along Comes Mary"" are interesting renditions they are not the original recordings. Russ is the onlyoriginal member so it APPEARS these songs were re-recorded by the new band. Still, the harmony is still there so the othercuts sound good."
4,"Sea Of Stars, Rose, and Frozen will place you in a trance","I have this album and it is a very chillin record. The album takes me on a journey to harmony. This company keeps pushing out more and more albums and the best thing is, is that they are independent. I have seen Eric Zielinski perform and I write down the sets every time. I have a few bootlegs of his early recordings, and I trade frequently. For more info on his album or other information please email him: curbsidesoul@yahoo.com... Enjoy the Blue Rose"
2,not as shown or described.,"The product is not as described, instead of having four (4) bags as shown, it has three (3).That makes a big difference in air flow. The original filter had four (4) bags."
1,TERRIBLE customer service,"I bought the product a 2 years ago, when the back tires were still the typethat have air and you have to pump up. Had some problems pumping them up dueto the proximity of spokes to the nozzle. Other people must have had same problem so now tires are solid, which is great except they cost an arm and a leg to replace -about the same price as whole chair.Invacare cust service was extremely UN-HELPFUL and would give me no break on the new tires, even though it was bad design in the first place. Will NEVER buy an Invacare product again."
2,Filled with Pathetic Filler,This video could be so much better if they just showed the bloopers. It is filled with so many stupid and pathetic skits that I ended up fast-forwarding through most of the DVD. When is someone just going to make a plain BLOOPERS video?
2,Get To The Point,It took the author almost the whole book to get to any serious action and by then he had run out of room.
2,Not well written,What an unsatisfactory read.There are several pieces of information that just aren't threaded together. Some of the behaviors of the characters have no motivation.Sad. It couldn've been a great book.
2,depressing,"This book is entirly to sad. I really enjoyed the style of writing, also the plot, story line, character development. But it is entirely to depressing. I want gritty reality, but I don't want to have to take prozac afterward. When I started crying on the treadmill, I knew it was time to quit."
1,Trite,"triteadj. triter, tritestLacking power to evoke interest through overuse or repetition; hackneyed.Archaic. Frayed or worn out by use."
3,A little slow,"After purchasing and reading 'The Most Wanted' and 'Deep end of the Ocean', I was quite disappointed with 'A Theory of Relativity'. The book delves into the legal world of adoptions and whilst i have learnt a great deal, I found the book somewhat slow and hard to get into. The author tends to go too deeply into the legal jargon and I feel that the book loses the real emphasis of the story- the relationship between the child and uncle. Above all I must commend this talented author"
4,Great book,"This was a heartfelt story, and I loved every word. My husband's father adopted him and therefore, I felt a deep connection to this story before I opened the book. I thought that the characters were realistically flawed, and that just enhanced my enjoyement of the book.There were times that I felt a little overwhelmed by the details in the story, but I was happy to get to know the characters.I especially enjoyed the ending of this book. I really loved the way the author gave us a chance to hear from Keefer, which was not the case (due to her age) throughout the novel.Great book from a great author!"
2,could not finish,"I could not finish this book. I thought it just dragged on. The topic is interesting, but the book does not pull it together."
2,"show, don't tell...did an editor even read the manuscript?","to say i was disappointed in 'relativity' would be an understatement. i was enthralled by mitchard's 'deep end of the ocean'and left in awe of her ability to write some of the most poignant literature i've ever read. then came 'the most wanted', which left me wondering if it was written by the same author. but i'm willing to forgive and move on. so, when i saw she had a new book out, i was elated!and then i read the book. 'relativity' is 80% prose, telling, and historical account and about 20% dialogue and action. i found myself skipping page after page after page in hunt for -something- to pique my interest. i never found it. as a reader,i feel cheeted because 'relativity' could have been so much better if mitchard had stuck to the old publishing mantra, ""show, don't tell."""
3,a good read,"This book by Mitchard was a good read. Had a little trouble with all the names in the first part of the book but became acquainted with them later on. The plot is gripping and one that I am sure many people have to live and face up to in todays world.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Not worth the buy,"This book is the story of a family thrown into a custody battle when there is a horrible car accident. The story line is wonderfully set up, the characters interesting, the plot seems wonderful. But then the author writes the book as if she is attempting to re-create stereo instructions. Every scene is met with about two pages of unnecessary and often confusing descriptions. I couldnt get past the first two pages when there is car crash and the author spends too much time and energy describing the fathers antique car. I dont recommend this book unless you enjoy reading novels written as a complicated Medical Journel article."
3,Not my favorite of hers,"Well, I really enjoyed Deep end of the Ocean and The Most Wanted. This was not my favorite of Mitchard's. I am an avid reader with a large vocabulary and I had a hard time following certain things that were happening. There were conversations that seemed to leave the reader hanging, descriptions of things that didn't make sense to me...I liked the basis of the story though. Wondering what would happen was what kept me reading. However, I often found myself wondering what the characters were thinking though...Worth a read I suppose."
4,WHO WILL ADOPT THE ORPHANED ONE YEAR OLD,"What a heart wrenching story - a young child is orphaned when her parents are killed in an automobile crash and both sides of her family (grandparents and aunts/uncles) want to raise her. This is a wonderfully tense and moving story. I really felt the emotional upheaval they were all going through. There were many thought-provoking issues the book.Gordon and his parents quite naturally assume that they will be one year old Keefer's guardians. However, Ray's parents believe otherwise. There is little time for each family to mourn their losses before an ugly and long drawn out custody battle ensues.I found the story fast pace and engrossing. I would recommend it."
2,Just okay,"I was really looking forward to reading this because a friend highly recommended it. I'm pretty open minded (especially after having read ""Running with Scissors"") so I'm surprised it didn't enjoy it.The characters were well developed but the writing was hard to follow. Hence, I too, caught myself re-reading portions to clear up the confusion. A lot of tangents...kind of like conversations with girlfriends over a few glasses of wine.Being from Madison, it's always nice to read references to places you know but even that didn't excite me that much. I wonder if I had been involved in an adoption issue that I might not have found this a better book? Hmmmm.The best part was the last chapter and Keefer's voice of a child having gone through a tough life experience. A good reminder of how resillient children really are.I will try another couple of Mitchard's books to see if this was indeed an ""editor"" related issue."
2,"So much potential, but so disappointing!","I became a fan of Jacquelyn Mitchard after reading--and LOVING--The Most Wanted. I immediately went to my favorite Borders and invested in The Deep End of the Ocean, which is one of the few books that has actually made me cry. I waited on pins and needles for Jacquelyn's next book and bought it in hardcover as soon as it came out, but what a disappointment.The premise is strong, but the execution does not rise to the challenge. Her previous two novels had such sweeping, gripping emotions--this novel was too crowded with characters and objective details to provide the emotional experience I expected.Jacquelyn is a GREAT writer--I only hope she comes out with a better book SOON."
3,WTF???,Where is it? The tome of the century even if it was the last century is eagerly awaited by legions of radio mavens and collectors of audio history and even many others who were there for radio rennaisancebut the question remains...where is it? Hard to review it if ya can't even view it.Sid Hartha
4,"Excellent, matter of fact text","The books by Slater (one of the great professors at MIT) are known by the low sophistication of formalism combined with a deep physical insight, apparent in the way problems are solved, using analogies, clever simplifications, numerical estimates, etc. It's physics, Fermi style. Though the theory is very sound, it is in the problems that the book excells. If you work through them, you're done with electromagnetism, and you'll love it forever."
5,A very good SECOND book on EM,"This is a very good book to follow the study of, say, Haliday. Slater was, in writing it, worried about teaching methods of theoretical physics, as well as of electromagnetism. The text is brief and to the point, with the elegance typical of the master Slater was. Maybe the strongest point, however, are the exercises. These are the best you will find in any book on EM."
1,"if you're not a Ph.D., don't even bother.","If this book were written in hieroglyphics or Greek, it would be easier to understand, at least if you're not in at least your third year of physics or electrical engineering. I purchased this book after reading the other review and felt the need to add my opinion."
2,"Not what you think of a ""hair rat?""","It was not what I expected? I could have taken a chignon from Sally's & cut open? It is a roll, with a snap at the end. I can't use is,(?)but a professional probably could? The color was a little off from the picture, I think with some tweeking w/hair extensions, maybe it could be fantasic? I won't give up on it yet! If it were more what ""we think"" of as a hair rat, it'd be 5 stars. I will keep trying to find a style for it/or ask hairdresser for ideas. *good product, if you know more about ""hair rats of this century!"" Its cool,be creative-I guess?"
5,Excellent; worth it,"Excellent extra-long battery for the iPod, especially if you are using the video iPod and watching a lot. It lasted me about 8-10 hours and worked perfectly. Highly recommended."
2,Not As Expected,"I paid for the new model but received the old model in the new model box. Irregardless, it did not work as well as advertised. I only received and extra 3:30 hours of video power for my 5th gen IPOD. I returned it and bought the Energizer 'Energi To Go' for $20. Tiny plastic holder of 2 AA batteries that fits all Ipods. My IPOD played movies for 8 hours and since you can always carry around a couple of spare batteries, the Energizer can have you watching as long as you need. Much better product for a 3rd of the cost."
5,Works the way it should,I bought this for my braindead Classic that only charges in the car and it works great to keep it charged for longer periods of time :)
2,Poor quality - buy the real thing,This certainly didn't live up to my expectations. Collets are PLASTIC and therefore can't do what they are supposed to - hold the knife blades FIRMLY in place. Buy the name brand - it's worth it.
2,Enjoyable reading,This book has nice character development and the story is a compelling one. It would benefit from some copy editing and the inclusion of a map for those not familiar with Seattle streets. Mr. Donahue's knowledge of Seattle in the early 1900's is apparent in his attention to historical detail. It certainly kept my interest and added dimension to my knowledge of Seattle's history.
2,Light Duty Unit Only,"When my old Sears vac died, I decided to try the Shop-Vac 610 - it looked strong and the stainless steel tank looked like it would last forever.One thing I neglected to check on was POWER. This machine is light duty, and I should have known the small hose size was indicative of its capability - it is not nearly as powerful as the old, noisy Sears unit.If anyone will make me an offer for this unit, I would like to upgrade to something that really performs like a shop vac should."
5,I adore this book!,I have played the piano professionally for over 20 years - although in venues decidedly less glamorous than many mentioned in the book. I laughed out loud at the bizarre situations Ms. Goldsby sometimes found herself in as she shared her music. I love her humor!I had planned to lend my book to my brother - but I want to read it again first!
1,waste of money,"Sad to have purchased this item. Not worth the subscription price. I used to use it to advertise editorial services, but they no longer have that feature. Not useful in my business and when the issues come I just throw them out."
4,It's almost a live greatest hits album...,"As live albums go this is one of the better ones out there. The best thing about it is that it a real live album. They didn't use studio tricks to cover their mistakes. If you haven't had a chance to see Bad Religion live, this is the next best thing. I think the recording quality is pretty good. All of the levels seem about right. The only problem that I have is that is sounds slightly hollow, but that is probably part of the limitation of DAT tape. The only other complaint is that it is missing a few of my favorite songs like ""digital boy"" and ""What can you do?"". What it is missing it makes up for, however. It even includes songs that they probably don't play often like ""portrait of Authority"" and ""Drunk Sincerity"". All in all, I'd say that this is the next best thing to being there. I saw them in Kansas City and i hope to see them again in a couple of months. So, if you can't go to a show buy this. In fact, buy it anyway."
3,Housewives From Another World(2010),"What can I say about this film? It is what it is. A soft core porn-sci-fi-comedy filmed at some rich guy's house. This is Cinemax After Dark fodder. The credits are an homage to Star Trek II...I think. The CGI looks decent considering the low budget. The ""plot"" is just set ups for nudity and soft core sex scenes. Housewives From Another World(2010) is junk food cinema for bad movie junkies."
3,"Color Surprises, A Pop up Book",Pop ups were disappointing. Very basic. Good book for teaching colors to young children.
4,Vivid colors and a captivating choice of pop-up items.,"This book quickly became my daughter's favorite book. The colors are eye catching and the pop-up items representing each color are unique and really make the color jump off of the page. A great investment, your child will love it."
3,Just okay...,"From the glowing reviews, I really expected the book to blow my mind. In reality, it turned out that only the very last pop-up is really spectacular and elaborate, the rest are far more average. Plus, the book proved too fragile for a 2,5-year-old, who wanted to make everything pop up on her own. After only a couple of reads, the tore the penguins, then the snake...Also, from the reviews I was under the impression that the book teachers colors... I.e. I thought there was a fun and meaningful text that went with the pop-ups, while it turned out that there is none.I would not purchase this book again."
2,"Book seems fine, but the condition isn't so good.","This book was listed as new, but doesn't look new. There isn't anything as overt as mentioned in the similar one-star review, but regardless- there appear to be some smudges and dirt on a few of the pages. It looks like it was a shelf copy, maybe. Uncool."
1,Very disappointed!!,This book was listed as used/good and was NOT in good condition. The green color flap is missing on the page with the snake and the zebra has been completely torn out on the black/white page. I was very disappointed because I had planned on reading this book to my students to start an introductory lesson on colors this month!
5,Wonderful teaching tool,My 18 month old loves this book as do I. It is a wonderful way to teach a child colors while maintaining their interest with the exciting and vibrant pop-ups. While the book's pop-ups are sometimes delicate for little hands.....my little boy still loves the book with 3 damaged pop-ups. For any parent or caregiver who wishes to introduce colors....this is a wonderful book for accomplishing the task
5,Love it!,"This is one of the best pop-up books and is very well made unlike others I've reviewed. Our 10 month old LOVES to open flaps and these are quite easy to open. She also likes to tear, so I have to be quick to move on the the next page =) The colors are bold and very beautiful and just pop out at you. Very beautifully done! I wish there were more pop-ups like this one since our daughter loves to interact with books and is always looking for a flap or something to touch or move. She loves this one over and over again until she pushes it away."
4,Good story,"This is a good book. It's Lessing, so if you're reading this, you're probably a German literature major. I was under the impression that this was the English translation of the story, but it's not."
2,Please Stop the Insanity,"Tad, Tad, Tad. Tedious. Repetitive. Arduous to read. How can I express what many people have already said? I give the series, not just book 4, two stars because of the fantastic concept behind the story, being trapped in... the Matrix, essentially, but of varying types of worlds. This story had so much potential that was completely wasted on over-descriptiveness and lack of character development (really, most of the characters in the end changed little to not at all from the onset). By the fourth book, with the characters being constant barraged and beset by danger, it grew tiresome without any seeming respite for them, and the climax and resolution were quite the let downs as well. The only reason I subjected myself to this torment was because of needing to know how it all came together. I am saddened to say that it was a complete waste of my time."
2,Not Enough Action,"Well, I've now finished the whole Otherland series and it was basically a drag. The pace was way too slow, much of the plot was extremely predictable, and the overall length of the series could have been shortened into two 400 page books. Specifically, waiting until page 740 of book four to bring Orlando back from the dead was silly when it was obvious from vol 1 that was the most likely thing to happen. Tad Williams can write a great series as nicely demonstrated in the Stone of Farewell but in Otherland, I think some money-hungry editors had the upper hand."
5,So disappointed...,"that it's all over! :(That's all I need to say! If you haven't read this book yet, do so. If you haven't read the other books in the series, do so. Now. Immediately. This series is positively epic. It was so wonderful to see all the plot threads finally come together into a glorious and satisfying whole.Though, as happy as I was with the book, there's a large empty feeling that comes with knowing it's all over. That utterly scans."
5,One of the Greatest Science Fiction Series I've Ever Read,"Otherland is a fascinating series of books, one that although it has great length it took little time because it was almost impossible to put down. The books told of one of the most realistic futures imaginable. There are so many twists and turns in this epic tale of friendship, war, and courage mixed with the thrilling worlds of Otherland and the believable real world."
5,EXCELLENT Ending! Just what I was waiting for!,"Otherland Vol. 4: Sea of Silver Lightis the perfect ending. Most memorable ending for me, and the most satisfying and suspense filled. I've never forgotten these characters and the build up was excellent. I was very surprised and just thrown back by how it ended up. It is very powerful. Just WOW! My only complaint was that a part of the surprise left by a very mysterious character was more shallow and wishy-washy than it could have been. It was thought provoking and very good, but not as much as I think it should have been. In the end though, this book is the perfect ending to a perfect series. Possibly my favorite series finished. Powerful, imaginative, vivid, and the characters evolved in just the perfect way. Unforgettable is my word for this book. Tad is a writing master."
2,Not very useful,"A cute novelty item, but not really useful. Johnston's book ""The Complete Book of Golf Games"" is much better."
3,Hustler's Blues,"I was hoping to get more information than this book provides. I have found all the same information on the internet, if not more, than is contained in these pages. In fact, most of the book highlights the history of betting and some of golf's more renown gamblers. the actual betting games section of the book is pretty small.The best part of the book is that it comes with ""Don't Choke"" ball markers that are great to mark an opponents ball with.As a stocking stuffer the book is fine, as an end all and be all to golf side betting, it doesn't cut it."
2,Hustled Again,"Being a golf newby, I wanted a book about golf games betting. I learned from a patient friend what a Nassau Bet is, and he kindly told me about the customary side bets such as greenies, sandies, & birdies. When this book arrived, I was surprised to find that nowhere is there mention of these classic side bets, as far as I could tell, so I'm wondering what else is missing.I found the preliminaries to be tongue-in-cheek funny -- the gambits for getting an ""edge"". But I've had to order another book from Amazon to see what was left out of this one. I believe I've found what I was looking for in ""The Complete Book of Golf Games, by Scott Johnston."
2,I've Been Hustled!,"Actually, this book is amusing and might make a fun gag gift for a golfer, but as a guide to the rules and subtleties of golfs gambling games, it is of little use. My copy goes in my pal's Xmas stocking."
5,Superb for beginners and up to 30 miles per week,"David Holt gives you motivation, time finding and how to begin a training program, and shows you how to progress at a painless pace for gradual improvement for life instead of for just one month before you give up.Includes cross training for injury prevention or to lose weight before running; nutrition advice, stretching and numerous programs at 12 to 30 miles per week, at all intensities from leisurely jogging to fast 5K races on modest mileage and only 4 runs per week."
1,"Great ideas, not well organized.","While this author clearly has ample knowledge about running and training, I found his book to lack flow, clarity, and straighforward training tips. Many chapters referred to other chapters and it was difficult to comprehend much of his writing. Perhaps a more experienced runner will find the book more helpful and clear."
2,Yamabushi's mini reviews XXIII,"The worst, and last Clancy book I've read. Too much politics, too little action. This monstrous book bored me to no end. I can see why Clancy went back to a young Jack Ryan in Red Rabbit."
2,SUM OF ALL FEARS,"FAR TOO NARATIVE AS OPPOSED TO FORMERLY READ CLANCY BOOKS. LACKING INTER-PERSONAL REMARKS. HAD QUITE ENOUGH PHYSICS ANDCHEMISTRY IN SCHOOL. THIS ""BOOK"" LACKED THE PERSONAL INTERPLAYAVAILABLE IN PREVIOUSLY CLANCY BOOKS."
2,I've Never Read a Textbook More Boring,"I've been a huge Clancy fan for years, but WOW this book is dry, slow and dull. I'm astonished at how much work it is to read this book.I'm giving up at about half-way."
3,"Navy saga, Boatswain's Mate is better","Typical Clancy stuff but not my favorite writer. Maybe the movie will bring it to life. I recently read Boatswain's Mate, a sailor's story by Pat Johnston, and found it to be more interesting. The characters are more down to earth than Clancy's high flying CIA operatives."
4,A scary premonition from Clancy,"Clancy describes a horrendous terrorist plot, which at the time he wrote it seemed like fantasy. In light of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it is now a frightening possibility that seems all to probable. This book was ahead of its time, and if you can make it through the 700 pages, it describes a step-by-step process that is believable and suspenseful. I read this book a few years ago, but I don't think I will read it again. Not that it's a bad book, it's just too realistic and scary now."
5,I think that this book is one hell of a book.,Tom does it again. I have read this book at least six times and I know it by heart. I think that this book is one of the best books by Tom Clancy.
3,The ending falls off the table,"First, I am a Tom Clancy--Jack Ryan fan; SOAF was my 7th book of theirs I've read. This one has its flaws, though. Way, way too much technical info on making the nuclear device. Who are we trying to impress here? More frustrating: after developing the character of Liz Elliot throughout the book, she just drops off the table once the final crisis hits. I recall only that she was ""under sedation."" So what happens after that to her? Likewise the President. Once Ryan commandeers the microphone & tells everyone that the President has lost it, we hear nothing at all about him. Most ludicrous: within 6 days, the President is apparently replaced by the VP (with no details on this whatsoever), all important heads of state gather in Saudi Arabia for a conference, the terrorists are executed & the world is at peace once again. Amazing!"
3,"Meticulous, but good GOD it's loooooooong!","Howdy! It takes a lot for me (a fifteen year old) to read a book that is 900+ pages long (though I am quite literary and do enjoy books!), but media hype surrounding a movie always forces me to read the book! Okay, so its a Clancy novel; big whoop. When I read a book, I'm reading what the book is, not who the author is. The book reads like a Bible-length VCR manual. And I swear, I'm pretty sure after reading that I could now build an H-Bomb! But the last 200 pages make up for that with the incredible (and horrifying) events in Denver (I'll stop there for those who haven't read it)! I will add though that the description of the inside of the stadium gave me a nightmare for sure (those who've read it know what I'm talking about!)."
5,Exellent,"I am a big fan of Tom Clancy, and have read all his books and this is by far the best one yet. The concept of the missing nuclear missles is quite far-fetched, but Clancy desplayed it wonderfully in this book. The political jargon does get kind of long, but that is made up for with the intense suspense of what will come next. I would suggest buying it, because it is one of Tom Clancy's greatest."
2,On and on and on...,"Tom Clancy writes like he is paid by the word. What could easily be stated quickly is tediously rehashed. Jack is drinking too much. Liz Elliot doesn't like Jack. Jack is drinking too much. Jack is a superman that the country can not possibly do without and the stress is wearing poor Jack out. Jack is drinking too much. There is a pretty good story hidden in the ponderous presentation. For goodness sakes, someone edit the chaff away from the wheat!"
2,Not what I expected,"At 900-some pages, this book is hard to get started on. It could be compressed to about 400 pages, if the more useless parts were cut out. It was a very interesting story, but it was executed in a wrong way. One thing that bothered me was the excessive use of profane language. Does cussing really improve a book any? The thoughts of these people are horrendous. Women are constantly called names, and people suddenly yell out ""S.O.B."" in capital letters in their minds. The idea of a nuclear explosion at the Super Bowl is pretty exciting, but you have to read a ways to get to the real action. Read ""The Hunt For Red October"" instead of this. Or at least BEFORE it."
4,Another Hit from Clancy,"As with all of Tom Clancy's works the reader is sucked in right from the beginning to a multi-level story of intrigue and mystery. This one brings the Cold War era into focus as it deals with political events and players who must deal with a nuclear release in the United States by a terrorist group. The reader is easily led through a number of scenarios as to which country could have done the deed that ends with a President who has his finger on the button to destroy what he believes is the country and person who took thousands of lives in his country. One man stands between him and that mistake and he has to find the courage to stop the chief executive from making the mistake that could start the world on a forever ending nuclear war. The ending to the story has really a suprise twist, one that the reader could never have suspected. It's an excellent work and I suggest many readers would thourghly enjoy reading this book."
4,Believable and Fortuitous,"A story that is well written and uses realistic characters. Tom Clancy has done his research and has composed it in a highly digestible and enjoyable format. Great fiction and lots of suspense. One of the better fictional military story writers. Lots of intelligence and military details. Clancy has polished the techno-thriller genre and taken it to a new higher standard. I've read all of the Jack Ryan-related stories: Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, Rainbow Six, Clear and Present Danger, Red Storm Rising, Debt of Honor. They are all great."
4,Excellent and Exciting Read!,"Clancy has hit it off again! With an incredible story line, the are things that has this book bounding! Unfortunately, Clancy hit it a little too hard with all the things about putting together an atomic bomb, and the intricate details on how it works, but when the stuff hit the fan, the story took off! It became impossible for me to put down! A definite read!"
4,Remarkable Fiction,"As we again face turmoil in the Middle East, this book becomes more timely than ever. The story of a nuclear warhead falling into the hands of very determined terrorists, it winds throughout the world, through characters that come to life, and terror and suspense that will surely amaze and satisfy the reader.Almost too true to life to be a work of fiction, this book is more technical and heavily written than earlier Clancy works, but the high degree of detail and heart-stopping tension more than balances the scientific complexities in the narrative.At times the characters a carbon copies of earlier Clancy protagonists but the brilliant use of them makes up for some of their predictability.Ryan and crew are back with a vengance and the safety of the world are in the balance. A must read and a well and worthy effort. Not perfect, but by far, one of the finest nuclear terror novels ever written.And keep in mind, it could all happen as soon as today."
2,Dull and dry,"Until ""The Bear and the Dragon"" came along, this was my least favorite Clancy novel. Unlike his earlier stuff, he takes FOREVER to get the story cooking, and it's the first one where his personal politics really start to get in the way. In a book where it takes a whole chapter for a nuclear bomb to go off, you can expect to read some fairly arcane technical trivia.(""The Bear and the Dragon"" also has this in common with ""Sum."" They're the only ones where he tries to write sex scenes, and, well, let's just say it's not his forte. He should have learned from this novel that he doesn't do it well, and left it alone.)This is the only Tom Clancy novel I have been unable to reread. Some of them I've read five or six times. This one I just can't make it through a second time."
2,Don't Start Here,"I have read every Clancy book in the Ryan series and this is clearly the lowpoint. I saw some folks rating it highly and I wanted to throw my two cents in: This one contains almost endless pages on some suspected affair he's having from his wife's perspective, etc. By far the most soap opera-ish work he's done, making it hard for a regular Clancy reader to get through. The stuff on building the bomb is also protracted and uninteresting.If you're just starting with Clancy, I'd start with Clear and Present Danger or one of the more recent one like Rainbow Six. I'd start just about anywhere else if you want the best of this excellent author."
5,"So, when's the movie?",All I have to say is this: It took me only 4 days to read this 900+ page book. The story is so intense that you will never see the world from the same perspective again. Clancy literally forces you to understand every detail of what you're experiencing. It's frightening what he is capable of creating.
5,Tom Clancy's best work,"I've read all of Tom Clancy's books (up till Executive Orders), and this is the best one (with Red Storm Rising a close second). The way he showed the tense situation unfolding was vey enjoyable, and I couldn't keep the book down. I highly recommend it!"
2,Not Clancy's best,"Even though this book has a believable storyline, it is a slow read. The first 600 pages go incredibly slow. It is not until the last part of the book that the pace picks up. I am a Tom Clancy fan and have read the entire Jack Ryan series, but believe that this book was overly technical for no useful reason, which did not add to its readability. It could have could have and should have been streamlined. I much preferred Clear and Present Danger. I also recommend Vince Flynn as an up and coming political thriller writer."
3,"Good Story, but not as Good as I'd Hoped","Okay, I've read the five previous Clancy books before this and to sum them up-""WOW."" But there are things here that could've been better.First, the events leading up to the agreements in the Middle East went on very slowly, and I was wondering when it would be over with and the story would move foward from there. It seemed during that time that Clancy went into too much detail here about how the press worked, which was kind of a dull point. Next, when the freedom fighters got this nuke, it took them roughly 450-500 pages worth just to make it to what they wanted. During that time span the book went on pretty slowly. I won't go into further detail because others have already. But these are the major reasons I'm giving this three stars.Overall, I enjoyed the story and the plot was very interesting. This can be a pretty nice read, if you're up to it."
5,A great story that keeps you hooked,"Tom Clancy's ""The Sum of All Fears"" is one great book. This book follows ""Clear and Present Danger,"" which was spectacular, and this one is almost as good, if not better. The story is very technical at parts, but it's about nuclear weapons, so it's actually pretty interesting, and it's also pretty important to the story. Clancy does a good job at creating those bad government officials who set Jack Ryan up with a sex scandal in order to get him out of his job. In the meantime, some terrorists recover a lost Israeli nuclear bomb and rebuild it, planning a dreadful attack against the U.S. The action in this book is excellent, and the story is pretty emotional at times, and it's one of the absolute best that Tom Clancy has written. It may take a little while to get through, but read it, because it's definitely worth it."
5,Couldn't Stop Reading,"This book is addictive reading. Jack Ryan was CIA's rising star until Bob Fowler became President. He doesn't think as much of Ryan as the Deputy Director, Central Intelligence, and his National Security Advisor, Elizabeth Elliot, thinks even less. They got off to a bad start, and now she is above him and trying to make his life miserable by spreading lies about his sexual conduct and trying to create something to kick him out of CIA with. At the same time, a group of terrorists are constructing a Nuclear bomb that they intend to use at the Super Bowl not only to kill the thousands of fans, but the Secretary of Defense and the Secreatary of State, who are also at the game. The last 300 pages are probably the most intense put to print. The downside is that it starts out pretty slow, but it shapes to be among the three best Clancy books ever, and there have been some good ones."
4,A Slow Start That Builds,"'The Sum of All Fears' starts off rather slowly. The beginning deals with Jack Ryan's headaches as the number two man in the CIA and waging political battles with the President and members of his cabinet. Meanwhile, around the world, communist-arab-native American terrorists recieve manna from heaven- an atomic bomb. While most of the novel deals with preparing the bomb and Ryan's own personal and proffesional problems, The last two hundred pages are among the most thrilling ever written. The terrorists' atomic bomb is only the begginning of a much larger plan to bring the world, not just the USA, to it's knees. The payoff of this novel makes the whole thing worth while. In addition it acts almost as a manual for creating your own atomic weapons, should the need arise."
3,slow...slow....fast....slow...slow...fast......,"You'll need a lotta patience reading Clancy's books. Although the plot is great, Mr Clancy takes too long to built up the suspense and tension. There are a lotta boring parts, full of irrelevent information which spoil the great actions. If Mr Clancy can shorten his book by at least 30%, I'm sure the stories will be much more interesting."
4,Great book,"The Sum of All Fears follows Jack Ryan as he fights from Washington to stop a nuclear crisis started by a band of Palestinian terrorists. To make things worse, he is faced with a president blinded by emotions. As he tries to defuse the crisis, he wil face problems like none of his other adventures.Clancy does a great job with the story, and the characters are very believable, as always. The only bad thing about this is the pacing. The story is a little slow, and it feels like two-thirds is devoted to setting up the climax, but after the bomb goes off, it is impossible to put down."
4,"Great thriller, with a bit of","This was a really great story, well laid out and perfectly executed....except it had a bit of a subplot about Jack Ryan being set up to look like he was cheating on his wife and the whole tension between Ryan and the National Security Advisor (...). Had it not been for that, I would have rated this book 5 stars instead of four.And by the way, the book is WAY so much better than the movie."
3,i'm just not sure about Clancy . . . .,"yeak, okay, so Tom Clancy wrote ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""Patriot Games"" - both great books. but with this Jack Ryan episode, he screwed up.NUMBER UNO: what happened to the brilliant hero Jack Ryan. he's become a fat, over-confident, thinks-he's-invinicble, always-cursing slob. he can't just be a brave guy, he has to be rich and famous. his wife can't just be a surgeon; she has to be the best, but at the same time remaining young and sexy.NUMBER DOS: i'm sorry, Mr. Clancy, but normal, coherant, people do not talk like that (i.e.- he uses the f-word on almost every page). get a freaking editor, for Christ's sake!"
2,Too Many Plot Lines; Not Enough Direction,This book has too many plot lines going on at once. The only one worth reading is the one about a revolutionary group who uses a nuclear warhead to destroy the football stadium the Super Bowl is played in. The other plot lines are extremely boring and have no relevance to the one about the revoluionary group. You should only read that one plot line and skip everything else.
1,I do not reccomend this book.,700 pages on how to build a nuclear bomb. Thanks but no thanks. Clancy's worst book by far.
1,Technical errors abound in this embarassing Clancy effort.,"I'm not sure from whom Clancy is getting his technical information, but he ought to be fired. It is obvious that Clancy hasn't got a clue how things operate with regard to NORAD, missile warnings, or the military's reaction to such. His weapon's effects tome and its effects on commercial satellites is riduculous. Give NORAD and the U.S military credit for not being total idiots. The correct information is out there. Mr. Clancy, hire a real researcher! The end of the book is ludicrous. Let's hope the up coming movie is better than what Clancy has wrought."
3,This could have been better,"Clancy has some profound need to put out 1,000+ page books. It's not necessary. This could have been really great. Too bad there's so much fluff in between the covers. Overall a great story and well thought out, as usual. However, I and others, grow tired of Clancy's longer-than-necessary novels.The story reveals a very real look at what could happen should a nuclear device fall into the hands of a terrorist. This is quite possible today. What makes the book good is how real this situtation is. The terrorist group in SUM brings us to the brink of WWIII. Clancy makes it all make sense and so real. If you can get past the fluff, this is a good book."
1,Couldn't Finish This Trash,"Once again, Clancy has proven he cares more about trash than truth. This book is full of meaningless profanity and disrespect for Christianity (with a strange love for Islam.) The book also speaks quite disrespectfully of America in general, especially it's government. To top it all off, I read a review somewhere that this book had mature sexual themes in it too. So what's one to do? I quit this book... and I advise anyone who cares about their purity and soul do the same."
4,My god it is long!,"This is a very good book, with an interesting plot and good character developement. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the sheer length of it. You can read this book till your nose starts to bleed and only be a quarter of the way through it. The sequence where he describes the nuclear detonation is a good example. By the end of the book I found myself just skipping page after page of meaningless text to find out what happens in the end."
4,A lot of strategy and a little action-not Clancy's best.,"It is a good book and does keep the reader interested through the 915 pages(paperback). However, I was a little disappointed at the lack of a lot of action. As usual, Clancy's knowledge of the intricacies of our government and military made for a very interesting book. If you are into the Clancy style-read this book"
5,The Sum of All Fears,Scientifically on point. I worked in related fields during the 1980s thru the 1990s. Very realistic situations and potential outcomes. I am on my second read of the Clancey Ryan series. It is even more enjoyable reading them back-to-back than waiting for years to obtain the 'next' in the series to be published. Kindles have changed the world by opening new reading opportunities! It would be nice to be able to share a book with from 1 to 3 people without any additional cost. This would make sharing in a family easier. Love Clancy and Love Kindle!
3,Marvel Vs,"I like Marvel Vs cards, anthis pack is not an exception; great cards I recommend a lot for those people who enjoy the marvel universe"
4,A FINE STORAGE FOR ALL YOUR POWER TOOL ACCESSORIES.,"I purchased this tool box for storing my drill bits,Files,and mostly power tools accesories. The construction seems to be okay and rugged, all ball bearings seem to function well. But the drawer will not give you that perfect pull n push fit as we all wanted to be. When fully loaded it does give you a little effort to handle it. The lock will only hold the top cover and not guarantee to shut secure all the drawers if you dont push it in real good to engaged the notch on the back of the drawers with the other notch catching situated inside the back of the drawer I dont know about the two handles if it can hold the weight when fully loaded. Oh no, This thing aint moving out my garage shelf.But overall for a $150 tool box including shipping your pretty much safe."
1,Garbage,"This tool box is terrible. The drawers are not aligned, they will hardly close and it is almost impossible to lock. I bought this tool chest because Waterloo used to be a good name. This chest looks like it was made by a monkey taught by two three year olds. It is a piece of cr*p."
3,Great product but wrong color,"Thank you,The product itself is wonderful but, I bought this as a set to match a larger tool chest and I was sent the wrong color.It was a gift so I was unable to return it before Chritmas.It looks a little tacky because of the color difference.The one I was sent was red. The product discription clearly says it is suppose to be black."
1,defective unit,purchase on 2-02-06 only been using for 1 week and everytime i turn the power on fuse keep blowing. for such a brand new unit this should not happen or maybe cerwin vega is not as reliable or good anymore. still waiting for replacement until now 3-09-06 .will be informed when received
4,Cheesy but still pretty good,"Yes, some cheesy acting here and there, some melodrama and so forth. But it was an 80s telemovie, so what more could one expect? Okay, to be fair, the portrayal of nuclear devastation and the resulting radiation poisoning is quite good. And to know that almost everyone is doomed is a sobering thought to ponder at the end, after viewing the final scene of two strangers trying to comfort each other in the aftermath of the holocaust."
4,Stayed with me all these years,"I'm not sure how to rate this movie. My school asked us all to watch it and only if our parents objected were we not compelled. I watched it and it was months before I had another good night's sleep. At the time, and perhaps today, this was the scariest movie I had ever seen. More than the normal gorefest, this seemed like something that could happen at any minute.I have not seen the movie since 1983 but it has stayed with me. The memory of what happened to all of these people. Jason Robards in particular. It's important to see. To see the fragility of man and to strengthen ones resolve that this never happen. No one is a winner in this kind of situation.Not good for young children."
1,Disappointing,"This movie was essentially left-wing propaganda ... nothing more.I thought it would be more entertaining, but it was more fantasy than fiction.Only the blast scenes were worth watching ...I bought this movie and became so grossly bored watching it that I still haven't finished it a year and a half later. Don't know if I ever will be interested enough to?"
1,Very poor.,I got this because I read an online article that spun this as a cool movie about how society falls apart after a nuclear attack. I was looking for sort of a Red Dawn vibe - how people survive a catastrophe. I couldn't even get through the first hour of the movie. Totaly saucy 80's TV movie. Totally.
3,Nuclear War Lite,"Of all the WWIII movies I've seen, the portrayal of the survivors of a nuclear war seemed like an insipid version of the Blizzard of '78. Apparently the world only suffers a limited not full exchange of weapons, seeing at that time there were a count of over 40,000 nuclear warheads in the world. If the US were to be hit with just a 1/3rd of that arsenal, I'd think the effects would be more devestating than what was portrayed in the film. If you really want the Bejesus scared out of you, and see, IMHO, a true account of what could happen, I'd recommend the British film ""Threads"" that came out a year or two later."
2,Dumb!,"This is a typical piece of overrated '80s tripe. If you want a realistic portrait of a nuclear aftermath, watch ""Threads"" - now that's scary!"
3,Disterbing and real a great disaster film,I enjoy disaster films and this one I herd about and had to watch it and I enjoyed it. Ok it was made in the 80's so it's not the greatest acting and the special effects are not the greatest but get over it. Also the film is made for tv so it's disterbing but not too disterbing. The film is about what if the cold war really happend and the nuc where droped in the us. It falls the vents and shows us what would happend if it really did and how to rebuild civilization. The acting is ok the story is edge of your seat( if you canr get past the first hour which was pretty bad).
1,No DVD,This deserves 5 stars still I want this on DVD. I hate VHS. When it is released on DVD with extras on how the effects were done and the Nightline special I will buy this.
3,"Not Bad, But No Cigar","This movie wasn't bad, but it doesn't hold a candle to the best of all the post-nuclear-war films, the British-made ""Threads,"" little known in the US, though it was shown once, I believe. The heavy Midlands accents of some of the characters may be difficult for North Americans to understand, but the visuals need no explaining. Grim, grim, grim, the grimmest movie I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty."
4,For all of you Movie Moms,"For all of you movie moms out there, read this review to see if The Day After is alright for your childrenLanguage- Exsistant, but briefSex/Nudity- NoneDrug content- NoneViolence- Over all theme of movie, USA and Russia go into an all out nuclear war with terrifying reprocutions.Scariness- Thousands, if not millions of people meet their deaths by incineration, or radiation sickness. Graphic disturbing/scary images and themes. A Child is blinded by a nuclear bomb's ""flash."" A very disturbing and unsettling movie.Proper age for this movie- 15 and up. However, it is up to there parents if they want to show their child the effects of nuclear war."
3,Interesting,Thought this was interesting. Good movie. Young history buffs will enjoy seeing the tensions and culture of Cold War Era USA.
3,80's movie about nuclear war,"This movie was interesting to watch. The special effects are dated when compared to today's CGI for movies . The film contains some stock footage of nuclear testing. The plot is good, and there are a lot of actors/actresses in the movie who are still performing today. Overall, it is still a relevant film and shows possible scenarios after a nuclear attack."
5,The Day After & Today,"I love this movie. When I first viewed it in 1983, it scared the heck out of me, my family, and my girlfriend, along with about 25million plus Americans that night. The momentum building up to the fateful moment is difficult to decipher becuase the radio and TV newsbroadcasters are overshadowed by the characters talking to each other. If one really listens to those broadcasts, the storyline and dramatics really will scare you - if they don't, then you don't recall the Cold War (thankfully!).Good acting by all, a nice glimpse of how unprepared FEMA was in this movie that we can relate to given Hurrican Katrina; emotionally stirring if you really watch and become engrossed in the drama, because back in 1983, we did fear a nuclear war on a different scale than the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.A good movie for simple historical purposes, well worth it for entertainment value, and it's a cool glimpse into what could have happened to us back then."
4,Still a great movie,"I hadn't seen this movie since it was played on TV in New Zealand about 15 years ago, but I was always shocked at how real the events were portrayed. The graphics obviously aren't up to our current standards, but I never forgot how chilling it was to watch when I was a 17 year old."
4,The things we can do to each other....,"I haven't seen the DVD but I do remember watching this on TV.I remember that it scared me very much. I was 30 when I saw it and for days after I involuntarily looked up at the sky for no apparent reason other than fear that I would see streaks across the sky that I couldn't identify. I do believe that it's too late now for complete nuclear disarmament because there are too many ""crazies"" in this world and to disarm would be an invitation we can not afford. However, I do hope we never have to use ours because they don't really want to use thiers. I hope. I'm a fan of horror movies in which people are stalked by monsters, zombie, aliens, etc. These movies may provide a chill and a thrill but they are nothing compared to the chill I get when I think of what we can do to each other. Zombies? That's nothing compared to crazies with nuclear weapons."
5,"Excellent movie of "" the Day After"" and it's on DVD.","Excellent seller and quick shipment of this hard to find Movie from the 80'S. Most of these were done on VHS since DVD was not around in the 80's, But this is a DVD of the movie ""The Day After. If you are looking for this video on DVD, then check out this seller."
3,The Day After,"Well acted, not enough missle activity leading to actual city blast.devastation scenes as they occurred, all we saw of the impacts were mainly mushroom clouds, not a bad movie, 6-7 out of 10"
1,Day after a little bomb going off?,"I remember watching this when it initially came out in the 80's. Not knowing what I know now about nuclear war and seeing other films that portray it much more accurately, this movie is not worth the money or time. Nuclear war would be a nightmare. In watching this film, it didn't seem that bad at all. If you would like to see a film that truly displays the true nightmare of nuclear warThreads [NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2&4 Import - Great Britain]shows a much more realistic view of what would happen. You do have to have a DVD player that plays DVD's from Great Britian. I can only give ""The Day After"" one star as none of it seems believable in the light of what information is available online. Studying it myself made what we were afraid of in the 80's comparable to the film ""Threads"", not a Hollywood presentation of what could happen if there was plenty of land left and most people survived without a problem."
3,More Special Effects than Story,"In 1983 two films about a nuclear holocaust came out. The first was Testament. This was a film about a small town coming to terms with the aftermath of a nuclear attack. There is no finger pointing, just a human story about loss and survival.The second was The Day After. This was a much more graphic movie. The film was more about blame and special effects. It was meant to scare the masses. But a simple truths are more effective than flashy special effects.This is still a great movie but more as a special effects film with some great performances (Especially, Jason Robards)."
4,Creepy movie!,I remember the first time I saw this on tv. And it stills scares me today. It is a good & scary movie. And sorry but this is the way I believe we're going to go. We are going to nuke each other to bits & make this planet impossible to live on. Scary movie. Not for kids.
2,"made for TV, weakly executed story","Despite a few big name actors, I just didn't believe or care about the characters. The budget must have been fairly low and production time may have been short."
3,Less than pleased,This movie was obviously a cheep remake. The sound is of very poor quality. The video resolution is also of poor quality. And to top it off I waited twice as long to receive this video than any other I had purchased. I do not recomend purchasing this product nor any other from this provider.
2,Missing dialog.,"I vividly recall watching (and taping) this when it played in the early 80's. While it displays many of the trappings of ""made for TV"" movies, it packs quite a punch. There are moments in the film that still give me chills 20 years later. Unfortunately one of those moments has been destroyed on this DVD. When a fellow doctor asks the Jason Robards character what he saw, he replies: ""...it was high in the air. Like the sun exploding...TWO suns."" His colleague appears crushed by the revelation. It's an emotional moment. On the DVD it appears to be just before the layer change. Robards gets half the sentence out when there is a pause in the picture, then another scene. For all I know there may be more missing. This may not be an all-time classic film but it deserves better than this.The nice looking transfer doesn't make up for this shabby treatment."
5,"You must ""rm -R /"" from the shelves by buying it!","Great book for the geek! I start my day at work with my fix of the ""Daily Static"" otherwise know as the User Friendly comic strip. ...It touches on many of the issues facing the technical geek today from the point of view of the geek. Issues range from the AOL, Time-Warner merger to the geek and dating (yes, it is an oxymoron).The cast of characters are all well developed, even if they do only have four fingers. It is an enjoyable read and re-read. Get this for yourself or for your favorite geek. They will enjoy it!"
5,"Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here...","Once again, Illiad has given us a book filled with the familiar cast of characters from Dust Puppy and Erwin to the ever-frustrated AJ. User Friendly continues to make people from all over the IT world (and beyond) laugh as Illiad keeps his finger on what really is funny about computers and life in the digital age."
1,The Well Baby Book,The book was old and dirty. I returned the book after having to send a few emails. Was very disappointed.
3,It was ok.,"Christmas in Toyland was ok, it was kind of a cute story but I wouldn't say it was the best Christmas romance book that I have read, it is about a lady named Kristina Castleberry and a guy named Tucker Bennett and his toy company."
3,"Sound ideas, but tedious to read","I found this book hard to read. I often had to force myself to read further, although the ideas and principles described are important and should be required knowledge of any software engineer and SE manager (which does not mean that they necessarily apply to all projects).The book contains endless redundancy and lots of hard to understand details of projects the author has worked on. One chapter even contains excerpts from other books and articles that confirm the author's views - as though the author feared he hadn't been convincing enough (that wasn't the problem).In summary, the book should have had half the length and that would have still covered the same content. It might be interesting to readers new to the principles of evolutionary delivery, measurable attribte objectives, and inspection."
4,Good but limited,"Gilb covers only a small portion of ""Software Engineering Management"" in detail. Other important issues are either not addressed at all or receive only cursory treatment. Still, what it does go into depth about it usually well thought out and makes imminent sense. I'd say it's worth reading, but it may be a bit expensive for it's narrowness."
3,What attachments?,"O.O. so the vacuum itself is excellent... great power.. very quiet. BUT,It was shipped with an upholstery brush and a crevice tool. No extensions and no floor tool . This isn't a machine that Momma is likely to use in the living room and it's kind of overkill for cleaning the car. So, o.k., I'll order an extesion and a floor tool. They arrive and the extension is around 16 inches long. In order to use it I'd have to kneel on the floor. Plus the floor tool is so loose it regularly falls off. So, where is all that wonderful engineering. ? A high school kid would have done a better job. This vac is not cheap. Most shop type vacs I've ever purchased came with plenty of extension and attachments. This is lame."
1,Arrived damaged because of NO PACKING materials,"I've had this model of vacuum for 8 or 9 years, and when I decided to purchase another for my business I ordered it through amazon.It arrived in a box with ZERO protective packing. Not a bit of foam or cardboard. Not a single bubble of bubble wrap.Guess what? It was damaged. The hose intake plastic flange was shattered. I'm sure the return policy is great--blah blah blah. But it's a hassle and I really needed the product when it arrived.So great vacuum, BUT I strongly advise against using Amazon to purchase it.-Steve"
2,Don't jump to conclusions !!!,"I gave away my Ridgid shop vac as soon as the Fein box arrived from Amazon.com. That was a mistake!!!!...this vac is too delicate to use ""hard"" during my kitchen demo/remodel - and I got so frustrated with the filter and small 1-1/4"" hose constantly clogging, I gave up and bought another Ridgid vac. I think this vac would work great for woodworking, but general construction site conditions far out tax this machine, and it's difficult to get filters/bags....."
3,Unsure,For 18 months I loved this vacuum and used it for everthing from dust collection in my workshop to cleaning the car to general clean up during home improvement work.Unfortunetly I used it to pick up some sheet rock dust and it apparently got dust in the motor and now its exponentially louder than it was(need to wearing hearing protection now) and it doesn't draw as strong.Its now a real struggle in deciding whether to purchase another or not
2,Beware,"My complaint about this vac is the supplied cloth filter.It has a plastic ring that the motor sits on,the problem is it relys on this ring for a tight seal so debris you are vacuming doesnt get into the motor section.When cleaning this filter you have to treat the ring like fine china because if you knock it against something to dislodge dust to clean the filter it cracks.Once cracked its no good I have tried every adhesive-sealant out there to fix it,nothing will stick.I'm a contractor,if I use this on a job site and I cant clean the filter what am I supposed to do ask the homeowner to use their vacuum to vacuum my vacuums filter, give me a break.Heres a thought for you people at fein,make the ring out of rubber or a material that can flex instead of cheap plastic.These filters are fifty bucks a pop and I have been through two this year.I would have been farther ahead buying a sears vac which last forever and providing my crew with earplugs,lol."
1,"Yeah, but where are the complete instructions and parts","I WAS HAD. The blurb mentions attachments (plural) Where are they? I got one!!! I called and was laughed at. Sort of a ""Sorry, sucker"" laugh. I wanted to know where the instructions were and got snickered at again. I guess that one page bit of nonsense with typos was all I was going to get. No explanation of how the automatic turn on off works. Called the manufacturer's distributor and got laughed at again.While this may be a fine piece of equipment (I gave up and gave it away) it is totally lacking in (1) the attachments that are needed to use it (oh, did I mention that for nearly $100 ""they"" will sell you an accessory kit. Yeah, right!) and (2) the user's manual is all but useless and there is no on line help that I could find.Save your money and buy one of the noisy but well equipped and instructed Craftsman marginal pieces of equipment."
4,"Good vac, short on accessories","I always wanted a Fein vac and finally coughed up the money for one. I have to admit it is very quiet, very powerful and very versatile. It comes with a very long power cord, vacuum hose, flexible rubber adapter sleeve, large cloth dust filter, and an auto on/off socket that will handle power tools up to 16 amps.On the other hand, if you want your shop vac to pick up something special (like shop sawdust) Fein recommends buying an additional pleated filter [price], paper prefilters [price], and mounting brackets [price]. In addition, if you plan to actually use the vacuum to sweep the floor and dust some equipment, you have to shell out another $70 for wands and tools. All in all, it s great vac, and the tools are good quality, but a buyer should plan on spending an additional [price] to make the vac really useful."
3,good but not great,"This vac seems to be built sturdy and has very good suction. For the price however, I wish I would have purchased a shop-vac. The fein comes with no attachments at all and has no place to store the attachments on board. As far as the low noise people boast about in these reviews - it didn't seem much quieter than the quiet shop-vacs i've used and they are about 1/4 the price. The replacement bags are very expensive as well.The only way that I see coming out ahead on this purchase is if this product lasts 4 times longer than a shop-vac.If I were to do it again, I would've bought a shop-vac. Think twice before purchasing this one."
4,"Good Vacuum Overall, Cheaply Made Cloth Filter...","We ordered two of these for reducing airborne dust from random orbital sanding. They have been exceptionally quiet, move around well on quality casters, and have strong suction. The tool actuated switch keeps the shop clean, even with novices using the sanders.The one big drawback is the cloth filter that comes standard with this vacuum. The fabric itself is fine, but the plastic seal (a ring sewn to the top of the bag) is total crap. Both of ours tore within a couple months, and our 1 micron filters are relatively quickly clogged by the dust that gets right past the stock cloth filter. Our attempts to repair this ring have been in vain...Caveat Emptor."
4,"Fein Turbo 2 ""vacuum of information""","Received the Fein 9-55-13 Turbo II Dust-Free Vacuum last week. Just as noted in the description this vacuum is very quiet and has suction power to spare. Very sparse accessories included for an expensive unit, but the worse aspect of the purchase is that absolutely no documentation came with it. No warranty, no manual, no copy of the invoice, nothing. It isn't a warm feeling having no documentation and it is hard to understand why a ""top-end"" power tool company would not give the simple documentation that even ""Skil tools"" provides. I have been on the internet looking for product manuals and apparently there are none in existence. Good product, but really scary backup support."

1,Defective Clock,"It was broken. The hands did not work so I sent it back. I received a refund, minus the cost of shipping, both ways."
1,Frustrated in San Diego,"I ordered a Big Ben alarm clock for my daughter for Christmas, in the beginning of Dec. When it arrived, the hands hadn't even been installed on the face. I called and asked for a new one to be rushed to me. I was told it went out that same day. A week later I followed up on the order and they had forgotten to place the second order. I'm now waiting on a third shipment to arrive. My credit card was charged the day after I placed the order. I wish my product had been handled as expeditiously. I will not do business with them again. This was a very frustrating experience."

4,Use them even for fashion.,"I've been using a pair of this shoes since 2008. They're really durable, resistent and comfortable. This are suposed to be used as a martial art shoes, but as they were cheap I decided to give 'em street wear.The sole it's really thin, you can even feel all nuances in terrain as if you were barefooted. So keep in mind that not everyone can use this ones for long periods of time without being tired or with some foot pain."
5,Best collection of myths you could ever read,"I got this book from my home schooler and I'm glad she gave it to me. I have not read all of it yet, but I have read enough to say you will never get bored reading this book. If you do not know what book I'm talking about, the book is called World Mythology, An Anthology of the Great Myths and Epics"
1,"Vanity Publisher, beware","Do not buy this book, do not agree to have poetry published in this book (they will publish anything, telling you it is wonderful). This is the modern version of vanity publishing. It is a con. Try it for yourself. Go to poetry.com and submit the worst poem you can possibly write. Believe me, within a couple of months you will have a letter telling you you are wonderful and asking you to buy books."
5,"A ""must have"" book for women of all ages","Designing a Woman's Life offers powerful insights on finding your God-intended purpose in life. It is well thought out and speaks to the hearts of women who read it, offering empowerment and encouragement balanced with humility and honesty. Definitely a ""must have"" book for women of all ages."
2,Not helpful for beginners.,"I am a complete newbie to the world of FrameMaker and desktop publishing software. I was just hoping to find a book that could walk me through the basic tasks of using FrameMaker. Unfortunately, this book isn't it. The tutorials are tailored around a set of example FrameMaker files but the examples are either too simple (everybody knows how to use features like zoom, cut, paste, etc.) or there is not enough information to let the user proceed to try something a little off the beaten path of the current lesson. I am now trying to find a more comprehensive guide to FrameMaker."
1,The worst reference/learning tool ever published...,"If Adobe actually used FrameMaker 7.0 to prepare this book, then the stock values of their competitors should have gone up significantly. The lessons are poorly designed, and contain fonts and formats that are not native to FrameMaker nor their instructional CD. The actual instructions in the lessons are poorly written. Adobe Creative Team, please have someone other than your own team members try out your lessons before you publish another book. Perhaps you folks are just a little bit too ""creative"" compared to the rest of us who are still trying to learn to use this tool.I give this book -5 stars."
2,Quality Control - NOT!,"I purchased this book with the intent to have a basic knowledge of FrameMaker prior to attending formal, instructor-led training. This book has MULTIPLE errors. The software that is included and must be used for the lessons must have been created by someone that never saw the book. How can Adobe release a product with such poor quality control and so many mistakes. Do Not purchase this book unless you have nothing better to do with your time other than getting frustrated."
1,This book and its CD fail badly,"For someone trying to learn Framemaker, this book fails from the very start. The first format instruction (Heading 1) does not work (it is inserted into the body, not into the margin). The text supposed to be in colour is black. The character catalog illustrated is not what appears, actually omitting the one that the text says should be inserted. All this happens by page 28. (I was forced by the system to give this book 1 star, but it deserves none.)"
4,FrameMaker 7 Classroom in a Book,"This book is essentially an excellent learning book for FrameMaker. It covers most of unstructered FrameMaker's features. Adobe should be ashamed for publishing their Classroom in a book series with perfect binding. No learning product should be perfect bound because the book does not stay open to the page you need unless you destroy the binding.Spiral bind your learning products Adobe!Another minor criticism is that the lessons are a little too much aimed at graphics-oriented layouts. Most folks learning FrameMaker need technical writing centric lessons. It would be better if more importance was put on building great formatting for paragraph and character tags, and header and footers for technical layouts.Despite my criticisms, it is an excellent book to learn FrameMaker basics."
3,its good but dense.,"i liked the flavor of the bread and the shipping is always quality but this box bread doesn't really rise not matter what i do. I have adjusted water, yeast, and adding a bit more flour to help still very very dense not like the rye i buy at the store. I would say its the bread maker but other boxes i have used come out great except wheat but all wheat flour takes a bit more time i usually make a white wheat but this one even with with flour added not to my liking."
5,Great Basic Rye Mix,"I made this in my bread machine, and it was fantastic! The taste and texture were exactly what a rye bread should have.Next time around, I'll add 1 tsp of salt and 1 Tbsp molasses to fancy it up, but it's not necessary.All around, this bread mix is awesome!"
3,"Just okay, nothing special","This bread baked fine in my bread machine and rose well, but it was a letdown when it came to flavor. I wouldn't say it was bad; in fact it was good, but not any better than store-bought bread. I ended up giving the birds half the loaf and won't be purchasing this again. My quest to find a good rye bread mix that's as good as the deli rye I used to buy continues..."
5,Excellent Product,"Couln't find rye bread mix anywhere.Hodgson Mill Caraway Rye Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)Thought I'd try this product. Best rye bread you could find. I highly recommend this product if you really like rye bread. Better, and obviously fresher than you'll find in any store."
3,three *** rating,"Not as rye flavored as I think rye should taste like. But, then again,... being from NY, nothing taste like jewish deli rye anywhere else:) Baked on whole wheat according to directions and reg loaf. Came out too dark for my liking. Nice rise. Dense. Great for sloppy sanwiches, or for soaking up broth of soup. open faced left over turkey sandwiches? Will bake on reg light next time."
3,Proper warehouse storage?,Have made two boxes so far. Both times the yeast gave poor results. The first batch the yeast didn't react at all. For the second box I followed the proofing instructions. The yeast seemed to activate but the dough only expanded about 50%. The boxes don't expire until 2012. I'm guessing that maybe the boxes experienced too great a temperature extreme either in storage or in shipping. Could setting in a cold truck in the bad weather we have been having kill the yeast? Or is the yeast just too old?The flour mix seems to be great. The dough mixes up perfectly. Next batch I'll going to use my own yeast; hopefully then I will produce a good load of rye bread. Can't wait....
5,Easy in the bread machine,I love using my bread machine but often don't have the time or ingredients on hand. Hodgson Mill uses high quality ingredients that work terrifically in my bread machine. I can depend on serving great loaves and the dough is easy to work with if I choose to stop the machine and make rolls instead.
5,My Favorite,I love this mix. It always works. I use the dough cycle on my bread machine and when it is done I roll it into a ball and put it on a greased baking sheet and cover it. In about an hour it is ready to bake and it is wonderful as it come from the box or as per their instructions on adding cocoa and molasses. It make a dark lovely rye bread for sandwiches or toast.
2,caraway bread with what might be rye somewhere in there,"howdy y'all,i've made this bread twice now and i will be giving away the rest of the boxes. [*sigh ...*]it cooks easily and smells wonderful while it cooks. i was dang nigh drooling. unfortunately the caraway is all that i can taste. STRONG caraway. the comment by another reviewer to add more caraway simply proves that people can be really, REALLY different. [*grin*]made it with vegetable oil once and with olive oil. the olive oil may have changed the flavor but i can't tell thru the vastly overpowering taste of caraway.rated a TWO cuz i was expecting rye with a bit of caraway, not caraway with lots of caraway and a bit of caraway to go with the caraway.if you like LOTS of caraway - as one reviewer seems to - you'll pro'ly like this bread.i wish they made a version with the caraway dialed way back. i rather like rye bread.take care,lee"
4,Tasty bread,"Not getting the full rise out of this flavor, plus the European Cheese and Herb. Using a Cuisinart Convection breadmaker, making sure to use room temp water. Says to use the whole wheat setting. The only problem with that setting is, the bread will rise nicely, then the paddle will start kneading the bread again before baking, making the loaf small again. Using the light crust setting, this mix turns out excellent, albeit, small. A stick of butter and this loaf will not last long, I guarantee it."
3,Yeast did not proof.,The yeast which came with this pack did not 'proof.' We had to supply our own yeast. Forgive me for being angry but isn't this something which a manufacturer should guard against? The yeast pack didn't even have a date on it.
5,Excellent RPG (no kid speaking),"This is a excellent game! It is challenging and fun. The characters do develop a bit and the story is interesting. Don't listen to the 1-3star reviewa about this. If you like Golden Sun, buy this for a fact! The only problems: grammar erros in the text, and I wish there was voice acting, but it is stll great. Buy this game! If you liked Golden Sun, or a classic RPG (no hack and slash) buy this. If you are impacient, get Kingdom of Paradise then."
5,Great Game!,"this is the first and best of the legend of heroes series, two and three isn't as good as this first one"
5,it is a good game,amazon is good my game came in like 3 days that what i like about it i used normal shippimg to so it was all good
2,If you love slow japanese styled RPG's Buy it.,"THis game will have you running errands f-o-r-e-v-e-r. And ever. This game has way to much talking in it as well. I know. I know. RPG's are supposed to have talking. But come on. This one will torcher even the biggest fan of cliched characters. Worst of all, the battles stink. Sorry to break it to you. Skip this one and move on to greener pastures."
2,boring reading.......,- reading endless text (no sound)- run errend.....- reading more- run more errend............Kingdom of Paradise is a muuuuuch better choice
4,Disposable air filter,"A disposable air filter that fits. (JDS Air Filtration system.) Not much to say. Very good tool to have. Customers love that I use this as we are working. the disposable filter makes it better for me. easier than cleaning all the time. espescially drywall dust. However, Price is a little high."
1,Needless purchase,"In my shop this is to expensive to use compared with the washable pre-filter. One of these might last a month, but the washable type lasts for years. I have two washables so it is simple to switch when the time comes, and from personal experience it is cost effective to use washables."
2,Component inputs don't work,"The TV generates a lot of heat, and after about 10-15 minutes of use with component video inputs, the colors wash out. This happened with 2 different HD cable boxes and 2 different DVD players. The display is not a problem for composite video (yellow RCA) input, but if you are looking for HD, don't get this!"
2,Substandard Packaging,"First of all, I didn't recieve my entire order in one shipment. It was spaced out over a couple of weeks. It took a little over a week to get the initial shipment. When I did recieve my shipment, I opened the box to find the 4-packs were loosly packed in shipping peanuts. Because of this, one of the 4-packs I ordered was damaged in route. I love the product and use it daily but Vitaminshoppe needs to work on its shipping methods to get my business, again."
2,Lugosi's Final British Film,"The last entry in Arthur Lucan's ""Old Mother Riley"" series, ""Vampire Over London"" (1952) provides an offbeat showcase for Bela Lugosi - who handles the low-brow British humor with majestic flair. No cult classic by any means, but a pleasant diversion and superior to Lugosi's remaining 1950s output. (The original British title, ""Mother Riley Meets the Vampire,"" is available on DVD and features an excellent 35mm print, along with Bela's evil laughter during the opening credits.)"
2,Poor Reliability,I purchased the product approximately 3 years ago. After the first six months I had to get it repaired because of a defective motor. This week the product stopped working. I was undecided initially whether to try to get it repaired or not. I've decided that getting a new one would be better for me. I had relied on the top rating give by publications such as Consumer Reports in purchasing the cleaner. I will now buy another brand.
1,Very disappointed!,"I read good consumer reviews of this vacuum, and I had been happy with a canister vacuum in the past. However, I was ready to throw this one out after one day of struggling to figure out what was wrong with it! I was vacuuming my area rugs and wood floors. There were quite a few fake pine needles left from my Christmas tree, mostly on the wood floors. In years past, my VERY cheap Kenmore canister vacuum had no trouble with the pine needles. This new vacuum, however, ceased to function after just a few minutes. I emptied the dust bin, cleaned out the hose and the long wand - with no results. Maybe the belt slipped - but I do not want to bother with using a screw driver to take the thing apart and follow complicated instructions in order to find out.Back to Hoover it goes!"
2,Short life span,"This was a great vacuum for 3 years. Then it started giving me power connection issues. The hose lost power first, then the whole thing a few weeks later. My vacuum repair guy said that he sees this problem with all Windtunnel vacuums. The Hoover Windtunnel Canisters have a life span of 2-3 years. They do not make replacement parts to fix the problem.I will not buy any Windtunnel products again."
2,Electrical Connection btw Hose and Motor Breaks - recall warranted,"Yes, it's true. After 3 months the electrical connection (inside of the hose) from the controls in the wand handle to the motor in the rug beater - developed a break in the wire. I should have used the warranty but found a way to twist the hose so that a connection is achieved. You know, it's really too bad Hoover just doesn't own up and do a recall - Hoover is a great brand and this model COULD HAVE been a great buy. NO. Don't buy one."
2,Hoover S3755 Bagless WindTunnel Canister,"The cord retractor stopped working the second time I used it. The filter has to be cleaned after every use and takes 5 minutes or more to get all the dirt off. I much prefer a ""bagged"" canister. On the positive side, the suction is good and the attachments are easy to change."
4,Great vacuum!,"Love my vacuum...I have had it for over three years, and I use it every week. The only thing I wish is that it were more effective at picking up hair. I have long, long hair, and I have two cats. Hair gets tangled in the brush constantly. Apart from that, this vacuum is a breeze to use. Easy to clean the cup, and filter is lifelong! Love that I can wash all the removeable parts. Also easy to move around."
4,first canister vacuume,"I always wanted a bagless canister vacuume and did a lot of research on them. I finally decided on the Hoover bagless bagless windtunnel s3755 canister. I think it works great. I do agree with some of the others who have written reviews on this product that the container you empty does fill up rather quickly. We always had an upright so this does take some getting used to, but I'm sure in time I will be able to use it with ease with some practice. And with two birds and a cat, I will get plenty of practice. My husband on the other hand still likes the upright models. He finds this one awkward, but he's trying. The service we received from Amazon was outstanding. I ordered the vacuume on Thursday, and it arrived the following Tues. That was great. Thanks Amazon."
4,Good buy for a good vacuum,I haven't used a cannister vacuum in years so there was an adjustment period but I am happy with the Hoover S3755. It works very well on carpet and floors picking up pet hair and dirt; very powerful. Emptying the dirt cup is not my favorite thing but it is easy to clean and it washable (unlike bags. I clean the cup over the trash bin in the garage; a minor inconvenience for the ability to start fresh the next time.My only complaints are: (1) the small brush attachment pops off very easily; (2) it is difficult to use any of the attachments at the end of the long wand on items you may want to hold in your hand like a pillow; and (3) the filter cleaning brush is WAY to tiny for the job - I use a large old toothbrush.It's much quieter than my old upright Hoover and easy to manuver now that I'm used to it. The dirt cup doesn't fill up too quickly for me now that I've used the vacuum several times and gotten rid of all the dirt and hair left behind by my old unit.
4,"Very happy, a powerful vacuum, perfect for carpets specially if you have pets","Performance and price wise I believe this hoover is a good deal. Here is just a short outline of my personal experience with it so far.Pros- i am very happy with the suction power- rotating brush motion is perfect for vacuuming my carpet, and since I have a little puppy, crucially enough it picks up all the tiny bits of hair- i've had the hoover for just over a month and have probably used it three times by now. Suction is still great and I haven't emptied the dust canister yet.... pretty good, as far as I'm concernedCons- the weight of the vacuum is manageable (i'm 5'4''), especially since it's a canister one rather than upright one. But no, it's not as light as feather.- only major thing i would change is the fact that the brush attachment doesn't move relative to the handle, so going around corners needs a bit more effort.Overall I'd definitely recommend this one!"
4,Quieter than expected,"I enjoy using the machine in general. Light, quiet, easy to control and use and the washable filter. Could have been better if a few things had been designed better: (1) the lid to tools compartment often get caught with the handle, (2) the metal handle does not often locked 90 degrees to the head, (3) the lid to the dust cup is not easy to remove and (4) the cup is too dark to see if it is really full (perhaps you don't want to see!). Solid value."
4,Canister Vacuum,"I bought one of these Hoover bagless canister vacuums some time ago to replace a Sears canister vacuum. We liked the Hoover so much that we purchased another one from Amazon for our daughter. The vacuum is easy to handle and simple to use. It has one ""good"" problem. It does such a good job that the filter needs cleaning at least after each vacuuming job. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good canister vacuum at a reasonable price."
4,good solid workhorse,"This inexpensive vacuum cleaner does the job. It has good suction and draws dirt and accumulation away. I am remodeling so it has been put to the test. I like not having to have bags to change. It empties easily. I am a little disappointed in the way it follows since it does get hung up at corners and on table legs. That may be because of the big wheels. However, I am very please with the cleaning and for a very reasonable price."
1,"Try the WindTunnel ""Electronic"" Canister Instead","That model costs just a few dollars more and comes with an additional powered hand-held tool, and also a hard-floor cleaning tool, both of which this model lacks. The lack of adaquate tools means that this model is very difficult to use on stairs or for cleaning large hardwood floors."
2,Not for hardwoods.,"I bought this model to replace an eight year old Hoover that had seen better days. My old model was such a great vacuum and I thought this one would be an upgrade.I have all hardwoods with a few rugs and a canister vacuum is usually best for hard surfaces. This canister is the exception to that rule. There is no separate floor tool so cleaning hardwood and vinyl is through the bulky power nozzle. This nozzle will suck up almost nothing that is on a hard surface with the power nozzle turned off as instructed. If you try to turn the power nozzle on and go over the hard surfaces then it scatters everything around. The only way to use this machine to clean these surfaces is with the 4 inch dusting tool. I gave up after only one room.This is great on carpets but the dust cup that looks large in the picture, only holds about two cups of dust so I emptied the cup twice cleaning one rug. This machine is going back after only one try. Sorry CONSUMER REPORTS. You were wrong about this one."
4,So far...So good,"I bought this to replace my Wimpy Sharp 4.0 tiny canister. I bought new carpet 7 months ago and figured it was time to buy a REAL vacuum.As a bad back sufferer, I needed something that was easy to push, lightweight, etc. I read just about every review out there and decided on this one. Walmart had it for 167.00, online only. I printed out the page and brought it to PC Richard here on Long Island. They honored it and beat the price for $165. It's a snap to assemble. 2 connections and your done. I vacuumed my 2 carpets with ease. With the brush spinning, it's easy to push around. Since my carpets hadn't had a great cleaning in months, I set the brush on full spin. Upon emptying the cup, I discovered ALOT of carpet frizz. Seems like the brand new brushes trimmed my carpets a bit. BE CAREFUL with the brushes. Next time, I'll just use the vacuum with either no or light spin. Other than that, I'm glad I bought this."
3,Could have been better,"We bought the Hoover S3755 from Amazon about six months ago. The vaccum has good suction which you can control via a sliding-switch. But it is very noisy and the wand and canister are quite heavy. Together with the large hose the unit is very bulky. The bagless dirt container is small and fills up quickly. It is also difficult to clean (poor design). The filter clogs often and again is difficult and very messy to clean. The Hepa filter (the second filter on this unit) is very thin and useless in my opinion. While it works ok on hard-wood floors, on carpets it is very difficult to manuver. Overall we got it cheap on Amazon and it is ok for what we paid for it."
1,a disappointing product from Hoover praised by consumer reportss,The belt that drives the vacuum falls off regularly and the bagless tank has minuscule capacity. it is no better than a toy. Searching the internet for cannister vacuums this product was highly praised by Consumer Reviews which lead me to purchase it through Amazon.com.
1,Dissapointing,"Upon initial use this vacuum performed great. It has great suction. The issue i have with this product is in the connection with the electrical. After a year of light use in a small apartment, I began experiencing shortages between the hose and the vacuum canister. During a normal vacuuming session the machine turns off several times, then being prompted by a good shake will revive only to occur again in a few minutes. It's to the point now where it's almost impossible to use when it decides to even turn on anymore. Very very disappointing I would have thought a product in this mid-price range would have lasted a little longer than 1 year. With that said, unless you plan on replacing your vacuum within a year I would steer clear of this one."
1,Don't BUY THIS!!,"Unfortunately, this Hoover lasted one year. It was used only for normal cleaning in a private home. This is not worth the price. Totally unacceptable. Wouldn't buy this again."
5,This Vacuume Sucks!,Bought this based on other reviews. I was still impressed when we got it.It's well made and seems real sturdy. Very powerful suction.Bought it for our travel trailer as my wife has been through 3 in one year just for the trailer.We have a built in at home and I still caught my wife using the Hoover :)
5,Excellence,"Since using the Hoover Windtunnel, the house is so much cleaner and I love how it picks up all the cat hairs that are on the furniture and the rugs. It is also not as noisy as my other cleaners have been and I just love it.Thanks."
1,"Nice size, poor workmanship",We've owned ours for 3 years and in that time we've had to replace the vacuum hose (the one going from the handle to the base)twice. I wouldn't buy one again.
4,Long-term review of the Hoover S3755,"This is a long-term review, as I have had this unit for a little over 5 years now. I understand there's a 'digital' model that succeeds this, and the accessories for it would probably make it a better buy but I believe the overrall 'guts' and construction are the same, so this review would probably be relevent. For the 5+ years I have used S3755 I've encountered two problems (one major & one minor): (1) the power cord to the drive/brush mechanism had a short in it and went inoperative after 4 years. It was traced to the 'yoke assembly' and required a ~$75 repair buy a local sew/vac shop. (2) The quick-detach mechanism that detaches the power brush from the wand cracked. The spring to apply tension to the QD ball was made of plastic, and not a metal leaf-spring like you'd expect!Because of these 2 problems, I downgraded it to 4 stars, but I WOULD buy this vacuum again, considering its a good value and it gets used 1-2 times/week in my household."
4,Great Vacuum,This vacuum had surprising suction. I could not believe how much stuff this vacuum picked up. It makes me think that my previous vacuum was not doing anything. Everytime I use this vacuum on my rugs the cannister is full! I like that there are no bags to buy and I can see what it picks up. I was a little concerned when there was not a separate attachment for hard floors but it does the job. The only drawback I can think of is that stairs are a little difficult to clean especially rug.
4,useful starting point,"When you're exploring our great state, this is a really useful guide to find a car-camping oriented spot to pitch your tent. It definitely caters to the RV crowd, in the sense that many readers adventures end once they hook up the RV or pitch their tent. I like to use these spots as the starting point for deeper exploration into the backcountry. Bottom line, keep it in your car, and where ever you find yourself, this handy book will help you find a reasonable place to crash that may have a great view and not be stuffed with huge tribes of families. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, you can find those too."
4,Solid Solo Effort,"Brad Corrigan is most known for his work in the band Dispatch. Let me start by saying I'm not the biggest Dispatch fan, though I have enjoyed what I have heard from them.I think this album has a good vibe, the guest guitarists such as Phil Keaggy add a little extra ""something"" and the stand up bass gives a good feel to tracks like ""Fallin'."" However I think the first half of the album is strong, while the second half is less enjoyable, especially the two instrumentals at the end which seem unnecessary. This album is still a good listen and I would recommend it to people that like music in the vain of Bob Marley, Dave Matthews, or Ben Harper. If you get a chance check out Braddigan live, that's where he shines."
4,Graet Music,"I was unfamiliar with this group, but it is good olid music. I have bought manuy other albums from this group."
3,Not that good as at Dispatch Times,"Well, I really apprechiate the work of Brad Corrigan, Braddigan, but this LP isn't that good like he wrote music with Dispatch a few years ago. There are some good songs like Falling (also known on the All Points Bulletin Live Album of Dispatch) and Pura Vida, but the other stuff isn't that good like his old songs ""prince of spades"" or ""walk with you"" or ""past the falls"" - nevertheless it's a good lp - good quality, nice acustic music, very spiritual, sometimes relgious,... but it's not a jam!"
4,Good read,I enjoyed this regency romance. Only one minor slip in slag. Interesting concept. Dragged very little. Interesting characters.
4,"""Cheerleaders Wild Weekend"" rocked!!!","There's one scene in ""Cheerleaders Wild Weekend"" that I thought more-than-made-up-for the other two weak movies on this tape. It's when the cheerleaders are all being held in a cabin after having been kidnapped by the three bad guys and one bad woman. The bad woman, who also happens to have been the school nurse at one of the high schools, decides she likes this one pretty little blonde cheerleader, so she takes her into the bathroom, undresses her, and gives her a bath!!! Yowzers!!! It was the hottest scene on the entire tape, bar none! Really, really erotic! They don't make scenes like that anymore, and I for one wish they would!"
1,Total Rip Off,"This is an adequate clamp. It attaches dust collector hose to outlets and appliances. It is, however, a total rip off in price. Amazon charges $5.40 for ONE of these clamps. This despite customer reviews of the item that put the price at 55 and 59 Cents for one! This is misleading. Don't believe it. It's $5.40 EACH. Elsewhere on Amazon other vendors do indeed sell these same or equivalent and better clamps for only 55 cents and 59 cents each. Mine are going back right away. I foolishly believed that the reviews supplemented the item description plus I was incredulous that anyone would charge TEN FOLD what the others on Amazon were charging. I was taken and it has damaged my trust in Amazon."
1,Be Careful - Big Ripoff,The narative about this 4 inch dust collection clamp is not clear about how many are in the package. I had purchased wire clamps before and got 10 for about $7.00. When this one arrived it was only one - not two or five - just one. How can one cost as much as five or more? I would not click this item for purchase.
3,Superman Just As You Think of HIm,"This is Superman as many of us remember him. No deeper meaning, no continuity concerns, just quick adventures against inexplicable monsters and events. Unfortunately, the Superboy adventures made at the same time are not included. Overall, this is how many people want their Superman. They do not want depth or explanations, they just want the basic Superman/Clark Kent, Lois, Jimmy, Perry White, and some adventures.The background feature also gives terrific information about the cartoon series and Superman during the 60s in general. Definitely worth a watch for any Superman fan, especially those with flashes of memory of this series."
5,More Great Superman Animation,I loved these as a kid and can't wait to revist these adventures!This will be a great addition to an animated collection to join the ranks of the Cartoons from the 40's and the great series from the90's! I know they've had to take out the Superboy cartoons that originally ran with it (probably due to conflicts WB currently has over the rights to the 'Superboy' name) but regardless this will be great to for years to come!
2,the new adventures of superman,"i remember these from when i was a kid. Decent set, but it would have been nice if it had been ""re-mastered"". They are a bit grainy and very blurry if i do a screen capture. Unless you are a perfectionist or have high demands from your entertainment, the viewing quality when the dvd is playing is fine, it just would have been nice if it had been ""cleaned up"" before being released."
2,New Adventures of Superman Review,"I bought this set for my granson's 4th birthday (along with a collection from the 40's and 70's). This is the weakest of the three sets. The writing is goofy, Saturday morning time filler, science fiction stuff. The cartooning is stiff, and overall, is not too inspriring for Superman. The material in the other two sets (40's and 70's) is better. This is his least favorite of the three collections."
2,A very lame show that I remember,"When I ordered this DVD, I forgotten how bad this show was. In 1966, I was a 13 year old dreaming of one day becoming a top notch cartoonist. I've reading comic books since the age of 6. So I know what's good and what's awful when it came to cartoons and comics. This show which was showcased as the man of steel's long awaited return to TV. I was very disappointed. The animation was stiff, the stories was weak, It was as if they forgot those great superman cartoons of the 40's.I took a chance on seeing this stuff from adult eyes, and not of a 13 year old. I'm sorry to say, I agree with that kid of 40+ years ago....This stuff SUCKS!!"
5,It's a blast from the past,"I got this along with the Max Fleischers's version of Superman 1941-1942 . I see that the late great Ted Knight did some of the voices and I think I hear him singing along with the intro song also.Anyway this is recorded in good quality and I think it's pretty cool. I think I like the second disc a little more but I like the first also. If you like good old classic cartoons from the 60's and a Superman fan, then you should get this.and yes my kids love this too."
4,Really works but...,"I have found that a drop of liquid detergent into a spray bottle filled with 50/50 white vinegar and water works just as well. Remember, you must BLOT UP as much of the urine as you can first, then spray and blot the stain/smell with this mixture. You may have to do this several times. Vinegar and water is an excellent household cleaner...no toxic chemicals for you, your pet, or the environment."
5,"This is a wonderful moive,and good form of art","I love art,in fact i am an artist....well an artist in training.I saw the previews for this movie and i was stunnded that how amazing it was. then when it finelly came out i was like i have to get this moive.So my mother bought it for me for christmas. we watch it that night and i was just blown away by this piec of art,the grphics was just superv. I watch the moive again and right then i started drawing the characters. I also have The first Fantasia I got when i was just a baby, that was about 17 years ago. Althought Fantasia 2000 is a wonderful moive,The orgianl Fantasia is the best,its a classic. Both of these moives are great, I watch them all the time. I would recommand these moives to anyone young are old, trust me you wont be disappointed. Thank you"
5,See this film! Donald is NOT Noah...,"First of all, don't listen to the reviews that say this is a copycat version of the original. This is a much better film than the original Fantasia.Also, Donald Duck is NOT Noah in the pomp and circumstance section. He's the male duck on board the ark who believes that his female counterpart Daisy did not make it onto the ship, only to discover that she did when they both exit. Noah is briefly seen calling the animals to the ark. Some people pretend to be able to review film because they feel good about expressing their opinions, but when such erroneous conclusions are made, you cannot take their word for anything.So,...take my word for it. See this movie!"
3,DVD worth the purchase for the extra goodies!,"Even if you thought the film Fantasia 2000, a ""continuation"" of the original Fantasia, was sub par, you may want to pick up the DVD if only for the two animated shorts that are included: ""Toot, Whistle, Plunk & Boom"" and ""Adventures in Melody"".If you qualify as a Generation X'er (or older) you may recall ""Toot..."" being beamed from a clunky 16mm projector onto the blackboard of your grade school classroom. Its a stylish and funny peice explaining the evolution of musical instruments, and was one of Disney's first forays into the widescreen format.""Adventures in Melody"" was originally viewed in the Fantasyland Theater at Disneyland in full-color 3-D. Unfortunately the version on the DVD is in plain ol' 2-D, but the colors are amazing and practically leap off the screen in spite.The DVD is worth purchasing if only for these two gems... I only wish more Disney releases would include such worthwhile extras from their vaults."
1,classical music for those with add,"I was not a big fan of the first Fantasia, but this is so much worse. The entire essence of the music is lost. I felt like I was at a Hollywood awards show (and I've been to them so I do know what I am talking about). A short piece is played, on comes the emcee to entertain the crowd.If this is what it takes to get people to listen to classical music, they should just stick with their pop-music sound bytes."
3,Why did they have to be cute,"The animation to Rhapsody in Blue was the highlight of this feature. The music and images matched perfectly and kept my interest the entire time. The other segments were good but didn't quite live up to Rhapsody. The only unfortunate segment, is the grand reprise of The Sorcerer's Apprentice. Why did they have to be cute and insert this bit. I have never liked it anyways, and I have never like Mikey Mouse. What was the problem? Were they unable to develop another original segment?"
3,"Very good, but...","...too short.I felt that the ""Pines Of Rome"" was beautifully done. Having always associated that piece with the Italian landscape, it was very interesting to see it with whales. The score was breathtaking. Beethoven's 5th symphony was almost magical, but I feel that a great thing was wasted by only performing the 1st movement.Everything else was fine: good music, good cartoooning. It could have been spectacular, but it comes up just a little short.I recommend using the DTS sound for the DVD. It enhances the experience ten-fold."
3,"Decent, if slight","The Bottom Line:Going into Fantasia 2000 I knew I was going to get animated sequences (some mediocre, some standout) set to classical music, but I didn't know I was also going to have to deal with interludes in which celebrities painfully introduce the next piece--maybe Disney needed to pad the tiny running length, but it detracts enough from the film to make me dubious about recommending it.2.5/4"
2,Vulgarians on the March,"If Walt Disney isn't spinning in his grave, he should be. Those familiar with the tragically beautiful story of the Steadfast Tin Soldier will recognize this happy-ending version as a desecration. And just how is the original ""Sorceror's Apprentice"" improved by the addition of a trash-talking prologue by Penn and Teller, suitable for a college crowd but not for young kids, about how ""magic is lies""? (Who is it at Disney that thinks snide, wisecracking irony is the stuff of good children's fare?) The ""Rhapsody in Blue"" segment is indeed impressive, but on the whole, ""Fantasia 2000"" does not approach its celebrated predecessor."
1,Fantasia,Was not told it was in Italian and there is no way to play it on my dvd so I was not happy there was no indication of not being in English
3,Fantasia 2000 not exactly fantastic!,"Once the start-up vibration noise subsides, I'm able to enjoy the movie! Also, it wouldn't work in either of my daughters' machines, but works in my very cheap one purchased at Target last fall. Almost seems like a pirated movie with all this going on. However, the transaction went well and I received the DVD in a timely manner. I now have both ""Fantasias"" and didn't have to wait for Disney to get around to getting them ""out of the vault!"""
5,Postive,I received this movie within a decent time and it was actually a wonderful movie. I am satisfied with my purchase.
4,my 15 month old baby loves it,"Well actually, she only likes to sit through the following:Track 2: BeethovenTrack 10: Flamingos/yoyoTrack 14: Donald/Noah's Ark (sometimes)I'm getting a lot of replayability on this DVD, at least those tracks.Personally, I like the above 3, plus 3 other pieces: The one with the Tin Soldier, Sorcerer's Apprentice and Rhapsody in Blue.Steve Martin was hillarious, even if it was for just a minute.I don't really like the other pieces."
4,"Good but not great film, but great disc",Not one of Disney's best. It was good. I am glad Disney put extras on the disc. They should do that to all of the major releases.
5,Fantasia 2000,"I was extremely pleased with the cost, quick delivery, and excellent condition of this DVD. I highly recommend this vendor, and would use them again!"
5,A Great Sequel!,"After seeing the first Fantasia, and loving it, I decided to watch Fantasia 2000. It is much shorter than the first, but I actually ended up loving the movie! There are many good pieces in this movie, mine being the Firebird. Some little children might find this piece a little frightening, but I found it beautiful, especially at the end, where there is beauty and renewal. Some other favorites of mine are the Pines of Rome which had gorgeous computer animated backgrounds and characters. I especially like the ending. I also enjoyed the (very) short piece ""Carnival of the Animals"" finale, and it also is fun to see the Sorcerer's Apprentice, restored and remastered too.Overall, Fantasia 2000 is (in my opinion) Disney's best sequel, and also one of my favorite Disney movies! Better than the first, and I think everyone will like this movie, if you liked the first one!"
5,The THERAPY!!,"I have FINALLY seen this film and all I can say is that the music and animation are SUPERB...magical and soothing. Unlike Fantasia (1940), the minutes flew by, and I was able to groove to each piece.The baby whale was such a character! When he/she got lost I nearly cried...but Disney stayed faithful to a love for animals and he was reunited with his family. I also loved the flamingos because they were just FUN. Imagine...a flamingo with a yo-yo?!Donald and Daisy in ""Noah's Ark"" was fabulous! I was very moved by their love for each other...I've never seen Donald be so...so connected with real feelings. He hardly got ticked off.And the grand finale! Wow! What a story...it was beautiful to watch ""the firebird"" as she created a wonderful spring and fought against the volcano. It was triumphant!Great job Disney!! I hope there will be another...the animation is stunning."
5,Bliss,"Maybe it's the fate of Disney that even with the 2000 version the Fantasia is not appreciated by all on the 1st viewing. But don't let the bad reviews scare you. It's another colourful escapade from the magical studios, strictly for the ones who resist ""growing-up"". 7 new fairy tales range between extreme temperatures, from ice cold whales to lava that melts. Actually, they are like rare, small candies that you snatch and eat secretly. If you want to shut all earth and seek comfort in dreams, then this might be the most suitable exit for you. The final piece, Firebird Suite, is beyond words. Bravo!"
3,Its a big production,This movie is a real big production. But i am not satisfied much. I wish i see the classical and cute chracters of walt disney more. But the dances and visual attractions are great. Buy it to make your collection richer.
5,Wonderful!!!,This was a visual delight! You have not seen anything until you see the segment whith the flamingo and the yo-yo!!
3,"Good video, OK songs","The pictures were amazing, but I didn't like the way they performed some of the songs (loud shrill singer at the end of Pomp and Circumstance, understated tone for Beethoven's Fifth) or the way the songs went with the pictures. The one exception was Rhapsody in Blue, which was a perfect blend of the story to the pictures."
1,I have not received this yet!!!!,"I have not received this yet. I have already written to you asking the status and I have not heard. It is supposed to have been received by me between 1 and 16 December. I wrote the 19th, and have not heard back from you. What is the problem? Either send it to me right now, or return my money! Let me know! Thank you! Hayward Paul"
5,Fantasia 2000,"I saw Fantasia 2000 for the first time at the Imax Theater and it was simply fantastic. As a result, I decided to get it on DVD for myself and my grandchildren. The DVD was really great with good color, sound and clarity. However, I was disappointed in watching it in letterbox. My new Panasonic television has the capability of changing letterbox with the pan & scan but it said that if the DVD wasn't formatted to do this, it still has to be viewed in letterbox. With all the new technology out today, why couldn't this DVD be formatted to change from letterbox to full screen. I enjoyed Fantasia very much but would be reluctant to buy anything in widescreen where I can't change the letterbox. Letterbox viewing is so annoying."
2,Disappointing,"When Fantasia came out in 1938, it bombed. Many years later, the movie received the acclaim it deserved. Fantasia has enchanted me since I was a child, and I eagerly awaited Fantasia 2000. The possibilities! I was sure Disney would come up with something to rival the original.What I saw was a humorless, boring mish-mash with only a few bright spots. The opening segment of whales flying through space was embarrassingly bad. Silly flamingos also fell flat. Donald Duck as Noah was terrific. The Gershwin piece was ok, but not for Fantasia. And what should have been the crowning achievement, a forest nymph battling to save her beloved forest, was predictable and stale.This film was almost a complete waste of my time and money. I heartily, heartily, endorse the orginal Fantasia as a timeless classic for all ages."
4,"Great Movie, but too Short","My family went to see it at the IMAX production and it was a great experience! My favorite was the Pines of Rome with the triumphant ending of flying whales, but Rhapsody in Blue (nice recreation of New York) and the Firebird (intense moments with the Firebird chasing the Fairy) come in close 2nd and 3rd. We bought it soon after it came out.I didn't give it 5 stars because it was only a short 1 hour and 14 minutes, whereas the original Fantasia was a long 2 hours. Also some scenes (such as the Firebird and a few moments in the Steadfast Tin Soldier) were pretty scary for kids 5 and younger.All in all, it was one of Disney's better efforts, despite the shortness of it."
4,kinda good,"i enjoyed the animation and some of the interpretation of the music, especially the gershwin one. the interpretation of it was perfect, but i didn't care for the interruptions by steve martin, james levine, and others. it just didn't seem to flow with the picture. please, disney, next time, try to make it flow. it is possible to have live people talking and making such a piece of art flow, but it didn't work in fantasia 2000."
2,This should be SO much better,"considering it was made 30-plus years after its predecessor, it should be a stunning production. It is terrible. The pieces are mere snippets of the original works. The animation was way below Disney ability and the awkward dialogue from famous people in between pieces was HORRIBLE. Dont waste your time with this one. You would be better off purchasing the original works (for instance, Stravinsky's Firebird) on CD and listening to them with your kids. The first Fantasia is heads and shoulders above this cop-out-cash-in production."
2,Another Disney Disgrace,"While Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940) expanded the animation frontier and was also the first film to have a stereo soundtrack (it was called ""Fanta-Sound""), this sequel to Fantasia is a poor excuse for a film and is another fine example of Disney studios' drop in producing quality films. While the choices of music for this film were wonderful, the combination of computer animation and cell animation created an awful looking mess for one to view. The introductions by people such as Steve Martin and Penn & Teller only cheapened the film and Walt Disney's original intentions of creating a visual concert.The only highlight of this film for me was Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue set to animation done in the style of Herschfield. With all that has been said, I personally do not reccommed this film. Instead watch the original Fantasia or Snow White. This film is good to place under wobbly furniture or if you need a frisbee."
2,Extremely disappointing,"I adore the original Fantasia and was eagerly awaiting Fantasia 2000. There were only 3 segments of the release worth seeing - the whales in ""The Pines of Rome, the flamingos, and the spectacular ""Rite of Spring"".While the Gershwin piece is well done, it just doesn't fit the theme of ""fantasy"" I associate with Fantasia. There is even 1 piece that looks as if a 2-yr old did the animation!Not worth seeing if you loved the original. For those who haven't seen Fantasia, it may not be as disappointing."
4,Deep and insightful,"Warning, this is not your page-turner, quick read. It requires quite a bit of reflection and contemplation. Recommend accompanying this read with something in which you can apply leadership examples, i.e. corporate leadership, family leadership, church leadership, etc."
4,Insightful thoughts on where we are headed,This book points out the reasons for much of the trouble we face today. It helps one to understand what is going on and points to the real solutions. Until we find the courage to stand for principle we will continue to slide into chaos.
5,Read and live well!,"If you lead people, you need to read and re-read this book. Unless you are already well-familiar with family systems theory, this will help you change a lot about how you think about leadership."

3,"Too much commentary, not enough music","The DVD had more commentary than I wanted and less music that I wanted. However, that is the individual DVD. However, this is not a reflection of Amazon, which continues to make available a large amount of neccesary and entertaining goods"
1,45 minute terrible,"this is the greatest rip off ever! old footage of a very few bands and groups of the 60's. terrible narative and only 45 minutes long! At least thank god it did not last longer, it is unbelievably bad."
3,1st 6 reviews discuss novelization -- not graphic novel,"The current (six) reviews of Phoenix Without Ashes listed here seem to be reviews of Edward Bryant's novelization of Mr. Ellison's script, not the graphic novel. The pen name Ellison used for the TV series was Cornwainer Bird. And the idea of people in a closed universe-type of story has been utilized in a number of books besides Orphans of the Sky -- Starship by Brian Aldiss, and Captive Universe by Harry Harrison, for instance.I've seen only the first two issues of the original comic series, but am about to get the hardback collection. What I've seen so far of the story looks to be a faithful adaptation. My rating is based on what I've read so far.With the right folks involved, it could indeed be a fantastic mini-series for TV."
3,Orphans of the Sky Retread anyone???,"This is obviously, to put it politely, ""inspired by"" a Heinlein novel called Orphans of the Sky... a good short novel, by the way. Ellison has essentially lifted the idea and expanded upon it, but really shouldn't get a lot of credit for the idea. Not original at all."
5,Monroe 911501,I needed new shocks for my GM 4x4 1/2 ton. These were one of the few recommended shocks. I believe they help handling and smooth out the dips a bit. My pickup is a little on the rough riding side anyway and you do feel the dips in the road. I notice they help with the transition from the holes and dips but you still feel the jolt. I bought these in addition to the rear shocks and am please with the price and quality. I think I saved about $15 per shock x 4 with this purchase. I would recommend these shocks.

3,Author of My Husband is On the Down Low and I Know About It,"I give Mr. King three stars for the national exposure and awareness of HIV/AIDS.I found it interesting that Mr. King stereotyped Black men. However, the issue at hand is the rise in HIV/AIDS in the African American community. I give credit for that exposure on the topic, however, the blanket statement of stereotypes is troublesome. In his book he said 'not all Black men are on the 'DL'""however, in the characteristic breakdowns, the Thug, Government worker, etc., could be any Black man.On the 'signs' issue, there could be several signs. The signs mentioned in the book are those seen only in public. What about those that take place in the home; some do exist. Not only the neglect and withdrawal is noticeable in the home/bedroom, but there are a lot of other signs, depending on what the couple is into."
2,What happened to love?,"I am not surprised the author did not talk about romantic, emotional feelings for other men. Most gay/bi men find it impossible to repress physical attraction for other men but often repress their emotional/romantic feelings for other men so completely that they don't even know they are capable of such feelings. They are confused because they are missing the one big piece of the puzzle that would allow them to make sense of their lives. Hint: homosexuality is not about behavior, it is about feelings and that includes love, friendship, intimacy, and relationships. The author has much more to learn and more people to apologize to."
3,"response to ""A Reader from Stone Mountain GA ""","Don't put all black women in the same category, not all black women are bashing all black brothers. We will uplift out GOOD Brothers, but for those of you who feel black woman are your problem, the problem probably orginated with you. EVERYBODY is responsible for making sure they are safe and protected, when you have enough respect for yourself this will automatically happen. I don't care that some men perfer sleeping with other men, that's their issue,it only becomes my issue when you are not truthful and forthcoming about your activities. Grow up and get a personality, possibly when you stop hating yourself, you can learn to love and respect all black women. This book just informs us of what is out there. Now spare us your drama. Good Luck my Brother."
1,low down man,"Mr.King is a low down man.He wants the world to know or thinks he is righteous by far.As the old saying goes ""John stayed in the army"".Which was not long.The book aboutAIDS statisics was informative but not fully true.Mr.King should have been fully truthful about his situation than others.From reading this book .I wouldn't have wanted to buy it.Depressing!!!"
3,knowledge That is Good to Know..........,"I started hearing about ""down low"" behaviour approximately two years ago and was shocked and intrigue to know what that was about. In this book Mr. King get as detailed as possible about the sub-culture that is black men who do not consider themselves gay but have sex with other black men. For any woman who have always have an instinct something is not right in their relationship with a man should read this book. What is also very alarming this behavior is believed to be the culprit in why Black Women are gettign Aids at an alarming rate.Like Mr. King says not every man is a dl, but I feel this book should be read by every woman who is in a committed relationship so they can know exactly what is out there. It is no longer another woman they have to think about but possibly a man which can be even more detrimental physical and emotionally. Interesting read."
2,Not What I Thought,"This book is not what I thought it was going to be at all. J.L. didn't give as much in depth information as I was lead to believe. I'm glad he finally decided to come out with his story, however a lot still remains to be heard, seen etc. In my opinion. I don't think I'll be reading any more books by this author, but I never say never."
1,D L is for denial,"This book has nothing new in it...DL men come in all shapes and sizes and colors...and if people think this is something that is new then they are kidding themselves...unfortunately, I question this man's real reason to publish this book...and he hates labels....well if it walks and talks like a duck then it is a duck....if you sleep with men and you are a man...no matter how much or how less you do you are either GAY or BISEXUAL...D L is also for denial to the women who look the other way ...you will be surprise how many men use the internet to find other men...and church has always been a good source of networking to find other DL men...they don't have those men's gathering for nothing"
2,The blind leading the blind,"So how does someone who is so confused about his own homosexuality write a bestseller about homosexuality? Must be that straight folks are pretty clueless about homosexuality to consider this slim book a good source of information. However, I do want to thank J.L. for drawing attention to this important subject even if he needs help in understanding it himself. J.L., when you come out fully, I think you will realize that straight women are not the only ones you need to apologize to."
2,"Good trendsetter, but now we have Keith Boykin, so who needs this book now","Great when it first came out because it was such a novel issue, but if you really want something good go to Keith Boykin. thats it. JL King fails to answer the most straightforward question his book poses: What is DL? He walks around it, then does summersaults around it, then runs circles and finally wrappes it with layers of gift wrap but FAILS to answer what Down Low is. Maybe he is being down low about the definition of Down Low."
2,Our Book Club gave this book a thumbs down review,"""On the down Low"" really didn't inform you on how to spot a man living on the down low. It just made you paranoid about every man around you, anyone can be gay. The best advice is do not have sex until your married and get him tested too.We really had a problem with the author talking about everybody else's story and not enough about himself. In addition, I didn't like the comment the author made: sleeping with men is no longer a sin because he doesn't lie to women about his life. Sex with a man is a sin no matter what and having sex out of wedlock is a sin. The media hyped this book up."
1,The devil???,"This book is full of CRAP...just like the author who wrote it. And to the reviewer (who I know, but won't bust out) who left the review called ""Ain't Nobody Mad But The Devil"", you need to stop being pusillanimous. Let me first make it clear that none of my reviews are ever signed, so leaving this one anonymous is customary for me. However, YOU usually sign yours, Ms. Diva, so why are you hiding behind the mask of anonymity on your bogus five star review of this book? This author paid you and your company money to promote his book in Atlanta, so of course you're going to leave a lustrous, magnanimous commentary. I laugh at your imprudence. At any rate, I ""amen"" those who say this book isn't worth the paper it's written on. It gets ZERO stars from me...and so does the counterfeit reviewer aforementioned."
2,What hypocrisy.,The Catholic Church is trying to regain it's moral authority by going after gays. The Baptist Church has long condemned gays. Mormons excommunicates theirs. You don't come out in most churches; you get caught. What is an African American man without his church community and larger community to support him? Ask yourself that when you wonder why these men when boys went straight into the closet and never came out. Ask yourself if it's normal to hide and protect yourself when people are after you.
3,On the Low Down,This book is not as instructional as it is the story of J.L. King's life style. I was looking for something more academic.
1,Follow The Money...,"OTDW is, hands down, the most dissapointing book I've ever read. It could have been a great opportunity to relate different experiences, so that all walks of life can understand (or at least realize) the desire for a married man to be with another man. King blows it, big time. There is no grasp of story structure, no levity attached to the people described and (most damaging) no sense of confidence within the writer and his sexuality. This book exists for the sole purpose of capitalizing on controversial topics for the sake of money. If you bought it (like I did), recycle it in hopes that a better book will be published."
3,Unbelievable,"I had to pick up this book to see what all the hype was about. I shocked at the number of men who are actually living this lifestyle. Its scary for a single woman who may be deceived by their man's dishonesty but good that the subject came out so publicly so woman can keep one eye open. This book can cause women to become paranoid, but that's where trust in your man comes into play."
2,meh,"King's book is paranoid and uninformitive. He makes some good points, but much of the book just uses scare tactics.""Invisible Life"" by E. Lynn Harris covers the same subjects in a much more sensitive way."
3,MY INNER THOUGHTS,THIS BOOK TO ME WAS EXCEPTIONAL. HOW MANY MEN ON THE DL WILL EXPOSE THEMSELVES EVEN AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT? I COMMEND THIS BROTHER FOR SPEAKING UP AND ALERTING THE WOMEN. BUT IN ALL HONESTY WILL EVERY WOMAN BE ABLE TO TELL IF HER MATE IS ON THE DL? THIS IS THE EXACT REASON WE MUST PROTECT OUR SELVES DURRING RELATION WITH ANY SEX.BIG UPS TO JL KING.
5,Revealing,"This book provides a great expose` into what is a tremendous public health issue. It is an eye-opening account that begs African-American women to be educated participants in the dating process and suggests that D.L. brothers be forthright with themselves and the ladies that they are with.Thank you, Mr. King, for the courage that it took to write this book."
3,Been There Done That,"I would like to emphasize Jason Alexander by also saying, ""Girl please!"" I too find this DL thing overhyped. And to those women who are worried about this, believe me it's not going on as much as you may think. I have nothing against JL King's book, but I am shocked at the relatively indifferent response from black men. I thought there would be more of an out rage. Because of my faith I no longer live in the gay life, but as a black male I can't help but say to those men who have sexual relationships with other men, and say they are not gay, ""Please honey!"" And to those macho men who say they only want to go on the down low with men who are buff and masculine. What do you think most queens want? Me too, darling (well more so in the past than now). I just don't buy these guys saying that they're not gay."
5,"Great, Must Read",This is a book for all of us to read. By far one of the best book I have read this year. Plus it gives us all something to think about. Thank you for this book.
2,don't buy it,"as a social worker interested in why people behave the ways they do, i was curious about this book since seeing j.l. king on the oprah show. i am sorry i spent money on the book. while i can semi-applaude king for writing about his experiences and exposing the dl lifestyle, king seems a selfish man who never cared about risking the lives of those close to him. and now he is trying to make money on these incidents. he does not go into too much detail, so if you even have a basic knowledge of the dl lifestyle, you will not learn much from this book at all. while i am an intelligent woman who knows not all black men live on the dl and that it crosses into other races, king wrote as if all black men are living on the dl. black men are often portrayed so poorly in media, movies & books...king's book contributes to those false stereotypes. i did find his writing to be quite basic and simple which made it easy to read the book in a couple hours."
4,Now let's do something about it....,"The book is very straight forward and to the point. Some of the issues and views in the book are controversial, but i believe that the controversy should and will spark a much needed conversation within the black community.We are facing an epidemic and this book gives us a starting point.Every black woman....AND MAN..for that matter need to read it, regardless of who they sleep with."
4,Wake up Call,"I think this book was a wake up call to WOMEN in general. Stop letting your desperation rule you and start using your head. When you get a feeling, ask questions and do some research, don't let your fear of losing ""him"" back you down. Your life can be at stake. As for one of the reviewers saying that it's his right to do what he wants with his girl and his boy, he's very right it is your right, BUT if you're going to do that:A) Be honest with your partners, let them make the choice on whether they choose to continue with you or not.B) Use protection, what you do has consequences for others.I think the author was just trying to make people aware, nothing more, nothing less."
2,Waste of Money!!,"I thought by reading this book I would have better insight on ""what to look for""....NOT!! I am only more confused and paranoid about DL men. The only positive thing that came out of reading this book....I am now dedicated to becoming celibate. This book made that choice even easier to make."
3,very informative,I learned a lot by reading on the down low. If your husband is on the down low I suggest you quickly by a copy ofDivorceDivorce by Gloria Jean . On the down low was good because where else would you hear this type of stuff from. Seriously. I feel sorry for any wife who is experiencing this. Although betrayal in any form is not cool at all. It's not like you feel better if it's another woman. I think you feel more deceived if it's another man like so you were never attracted to me in the first place you were just pretending and the whole relationship is a lie. Another woman and it's like your relationship is currently a lie. Another man and it's like the whole thing was a sham from beginning to the end.
5,Excellent!,"I read this book along with ""On The Up and Up"" and learned some very interesting truths about men on the ""downlow"". Don't read one without reading the other!!"
4,Brothas on the 'low.,"This book has been on my to-read list for a very long time and I finally got hold of it. It has been the subject of a lot of dialogue, as it should be, especially in African American and other minority communities disproportionately affected by AIDS.On the whole it was enlightening, and also surprising how wide-spread the DL is. What appalled me about the author - even more than being on the DL itself - was the rampant promiscuity! So there seems to be another issue here that was neither addressed by the book nor by some of the reviews here -sexual addiction. I lost count of how many partners the author had, how many were forgotten, and how many were not mentioned for the sake of space.The other issue with the DL subject and society at large is education. I think there needs to be more talk, more openness on the part of DL men, and more patience on the part of their spouses."
1,Let BLACK BISEXUAL men BE,"(...)Unfortunately normal Black bisexual men are just plain demonized and discriminated in this society and this book only makes it all worse.I'm so sick of all this ignorance from gay and straight people, not to mention the racism underneath it. They tell you to do the ""right"" (""White"") thing and ""come out"" with your ""DL"" (""Black"") life. Then what? Everyone just gonna tell you that you can't be yourself anyway cuz you sure can't be bisexual in this world unless you a sexy girl in a porno. And now even Oprah got in on it too. Whatever.So I wanna get my groove on with my girl and I wanna get my groove on with a brotha every now and then. So what? Wake up people, we been doin it both ways since forever and there aint NOTHIN wrong with it. We should be using all this energy to teach people how to do it safely. My Black bi brothas on the DL are keepin it real ... let em BE."
2,Suprise...,"What a suprise he's revealed that a culture where sex with lots of different partners and as a standard part of ""dating"" leads to social and medical problems.Kudos.Fix the society you fix the problem. Write books and you get lots of money - (...)"
3,Much Needed Indeed,"Even though the writing wasn't the greatest and the author never really completely acknowledges what he truly is in terms of his real sexual orientation. This book is a must read for black women (and white women or any other women who date black men) everywhere. You can rent it from a library at this point to get the full effect. I hate to say it, this book has really scared me and has prevented me from dating black men because whenever they walk up to me, I dismiss them as being on the DL. If a person isn't ready to deal with their orientation like an adult then I don't want or need them in my life. The lesson from this book ""Proceed with caution ladies or just plain old look elsewhere for companionship"""
2,Informative but boring.,"When a co-worker first told me about the book I was very intrigued and wanted to read it for myself. She loaned it to me and in the beginning it was kind of scary to think there are so many black men, whom most of society looks at as the epitome of masculinity, are actually sleeping with other men. This book had some info I definitely did not know about but as far as the actual writing it was very boring and repetetive. If you are looking for some interesting statistics about black men on the down low or HIV/AIDS and black women go on google. This book is not worth buying."
3,On The Down Low,"J.L. King gives us the quick and dirty about his life on the down low. He was a married man (now divorced) who was also intimate with men. King professes throughout that he is no longer a part of that lifestyle and he regrets the pain he caused his ex-wife and subsequent girlfriends. He also provides us with good information about the DL lifestyle. I found this to be quite an interesting and informative offering. Unfortunately, now I'll start looking at men sideways. Get it from the library."
4,Author of Poetic Thoughts from the Heart of a Woman,"I found this book honest and informative, although a bit frightening. I commend the author on his courageous efforts to both educate and bring to the fore-front a disturbing way of life for some men, involving innocent women everywhere. I also thank the author for not being afraid to tell this moving and compelling story of a man who was driven to go inside himself and face his fears beyond rebuke or rebuttal."
4,On the down low...,"EYE OPENER!!! Definately a good read, I could not put it down. I just had to know! I'm glad this book is out there. It will help make women aware of what could be- their situation. Now I know to be careful and the signs given by King are helpfull!"
2,Cheap product,"The mechanics of the ball retriever are sound, and it works really well capturing and retrieving golf balls from water hazards. My problem with the product is that the retrieving ring sheared off of the wand before I had had it a month."
4,For anyone who was a teenager in the 80's,"Fun book - especially if you went to college in the 1980's. Book is based in England, but the story is universal."
4,Knowing James Mcvoy,"I liked it very much, it was a great opportunity to watch more about James Mcvoy work, he is an excelent actor, plays a university guy who is falling in love with the beautiful girl but not exactly the perfect girl, and he discovers real love just beside him, in his best friend, that was a nice story to watch. It brings good memories from your school years. I had a good time with it."
2,pale,This novel rambled on and bored me. It is difficult to develop respect or a liking for the main character as he is portrayed and developed. That may have been the biggest difficulty and disappointment for me. I had to work to finish the novel.
3,"Funny dialogue, thin storyline","Having read, and enjoyed, Nicholl's later book One Day I found this fare rather disappointing. He can write very convincing dialogue, I knew that from the other book, but like so often with this type of coming-of-age novel the male lead character is totally unconvincing.What teenage girls 'see' in spotty puberal boys is not a new dilemma; it remains baffling. But here we're expected to believe that a gorgeous young woman would find this particularly unattractive specimen a tempting partner. Just a ridiculous concept.In this way Starter for Ten reminds me of Murakami's Norwegian Wood, that also expects us to suspend our disbelief. That book may well have been better written than this one, but it was also nowhere near as funny.If you like Starter for Ten, then you'll love One Day."
5,It felt like he wrote this book just for me,"I laughed out loud reading David Nicholls' novel that seemed to have so many of my own youthful thoughts and experiences in it - except funnier. If you've ever been self-conscious around a pretty girl, or been on a TV quiz show, then there's something here to remember yourself by."
5,Amusing and Entertaining...,"I agree that this novel is ""Brilliantly Funny!"" Moves along easily and is interesting and enjoyable!! A Coming of Age book!!!"
3,little disappointed,I loved Nicholls 'One Day' but I was a little disappointed by this read. I do have to say I chuckled out loud a few times. I appreciate his humurous writing but still a bit of a let down on the story.
3,Coming of Age and being different,"A great story for young adults, describes the story of a young acne prone boy, lusting after the popular hot girl, making the usual mistakes, and finding his way in school. I really thought the characters were likeable in this book, and the undertone of the Quiz team was hilarious. An enjoyable read, just not one that kept me up all night, wanting to know what happens"
5,A Question of Attraction,"All David Nicholls books are very good, his prose is beautifull, and his story line is so true to everyday life.Lalldav"
1,DENIAL WON'T CHANGE THE TRUTH,"DNA doesn't lie people! Accept the fact that Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one child with Sally Hemings (probably most of them). The depth of the racism embedded in white people's psyches amazes me. What else could cause people, even educated ""scholars"" to deny the truth supported by DNA evidence but racism??? Thomas Jefferson was a human being and like most men of his time, he had sex with a slave and fathered some children. GET OVER IT and stop posting ignorant reviews and publishing books denying the truth."
4,Channeling Frank Zappa in Utah?,"I would describe this album, at least if I had to put it into a category, as Frank Zappaish. It reminds me of free form jazz with some unusual and hard to categorize lyrics and singing. Some metal-like aspects, a definite lack of concern with melody - I expect these guys work hard not to be pidgeon-holed. Good luck to the boys from Utah! I added this from the only web reference that I could find - Found on the web: 'Few bands around today understand the possility of artisitic freedom. Thirsty Alley understands this completely.' Such writes one critic.After years of anonymity, the band has chosen to leave their mysterious island, Tikizizi, and not unlike the comic hero Zarathustra, they shall bring to the masses a peculiar message full of intrigue and delight.Zabitha Z. Zoome--vocals Dick Suave--saxes, keys, trombone, accordion, trp. Edwardedward Shovelhead--electric tailfin Roland Roland Roland--guitar T. LuDit--drums, lament"
2,It's all true. I was there when the stories were told.,"This wonderful little gem of a book should be read by daughters and fathers in every country. The stories are based on fact. I was there when we were being taped. There wasn't a dry eye in the room. To see the dads and some of the daughters who actually went through these experiences would confirm your belief that good comes from all experiences, happy and sad. My daughter read the draft and started to call me again. Thank you for writing this book."
4,prozyme,"the product does not stop bad breath, well it didn't in my dog. but it does help in the elimination of gas in dogs"
5,Fantastic Product,I have used prozyme for 5 years..My dogs have no skin problems and my older dog who is on an oatmeal based food with a sprinkle of prozyme and yes a sprinkle of meat twice a day recovered nicely with this recipe from serious constipation...250.00 enema!! Prozyme regulates and keeps everyones fur and skin perfect!
5,A Treasury of the Familiar,"This is the most amazing book! It includes any famous quotes, speeches, stories, poems, songs, etc. It is like having a mini-encyclopedia in one book. We use it all the time in our homeschool. You have to have this book."
5,Spectacular for any person seeking to find the best of most,I am 63 years old and my father introduced me to this book and its contents when I was very young. Sprawling across my bed with him on his furloughs from the war I was given a supreme introduction to the delight of that other world of words and how to paint with them. If you have children from 3-103--get it and read it aloud together.--Mine has fallen apart.
5,A Treasury of the Familiar,I had looked for this set of books for many years and was delighted to find a copy in such good condition. It was shipped very promptly. Wonderful to own if you love old poetry and quotations.
5,Old Faithful,"I discovered this book in the town library when I was in high school. I kept checking out this book over and over again and I couldn't get enough. My mom bought me the book one year and I was soo excited to own it for myself. It was one of the best presents I have ever gotten. The book is worn out now and I have to turn the pages delicately in fear of wearing them more. That just makes me love it more. My history since I have boughten the book is that I read it through and through and put it on the bookshelf for a year and forget about it. It doesn't take long before I long to read it again, I then pick it out of the bookshelf and fall in love with it all over again. If I had to choose only one book in the world that I could keep, it would be this one. Needless to say I love it!"
4,'A Treasury of the Familiar',I have an original of this book and wanted a copy for my daughter. I found this copy at Amazon and ordered it. I was quite satisfied with the product and would recommend it to others.
5,"Classic poems, sayings, etc.",Excellent book. Just as I remembered from when I read this as a kid. Recommend as a gift to anyone who reads and likes the classical written word.
5,A complete and comprehensive guide for the link planner,"This book is, so-to-speak, an absolute must for the Transmission Planner.The planner's successful implimentation of any point-to-point PDH or SDH radio network depends on his ability to select fit-for-purpose equipment, to understand the important issues regarding careful antenna selection, to understand the quality objectives he is designing for, to understand the mechanics of link design at the hand of ITU standards, to understand some of the most significant propagation effects, to understand the issues w.r.t. site selection and to be able to do proper frequency planning when needed - This book covers it all and more.Trevor is a true expert in his field. The insights shared in his book and his practical advice throughout is backed up with his enormous experience and well researched knowledge."
3,siemens S450,Bought this phone after extensive research. Wanted a DECT phoneGood product. The clock is always incorrect! Delay of few mintues every day
1,I returned it -,Voice echoed back to me - cheap casing that I would expect in a $20 phone.I returned it after 1 day - very disappointed and way to expensive for what it is.The good news was that Amazon refunded my purchase price.
1,"And I was so excited, too. :(","I read all of the reviews for this phone, and thought ""well, maybe the technical difficulties people had were something I could get past""--I'm very technically savvy-- but let me tell you... This phone was a HUGE disappointment! It had all of the malfunctions the others have described, as well as others--it rang for no apparent reason, would beep for no reason (not necessarily at regular intervals), the speakerphone is SO quiet it's unusable. The backlight on the handset is SO dim you can't read the buttons, and they are very small, so are hard to read even in the light of day.I was so excited about these phones--but this was a huge disappointment. I am returning them asap."
3,Underwhelmed,"I've owned this phone for about eight months and used it on a daily basis. The audio quality is superior to ""ordinary"" cordless phones, but the range is about the same as my other (non-DECT) cordless phones, and the user interface is poor. When dialing (or entering extension numbers or passcodes), the phone reacts S-L-O-W-L-Y. It will accept digits quickly, but the phone can process only about one digit per second. With relatively poor tactile feedback from the keypad, it's extraordinarily easy to miss a digit. So, hang up and redial -- and the phone insists on a three-second display of the time of the last call before it will even recognize the button that starts a new call. There's something obscene about wistful recollections of those ultra-responsive and -reliable 1972-era Ma Bell specials."
3,False information,"The phone is good if you don't need caller i.d/call waiting caller i.d. Even though the product description states that this feature is available, it isn't unless you have more than one handset and you are on an ""internal"" call with someone else in your home or office. I was reading the manual and found it strange that it did not refer you to the ""flash"" button to accept a ""call waiting"" call. I emailed customer support and was told this feature was only good during an internal call where you would need to intercept an in-coming outside call. Not fully believing this, I went on the Siemen's company website and found a customer service phone number. I called them and they confirmed that this feature is not available. Please be sure of what you are getting if you want to order this phone."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Vintage John Maxwell, too bad it is being sold on Amazon which has the worst customer service in the business."
5,Best book I ever read,"We all know this: the choice of our ""favorite"" book is a difficult one. Perhaps the ""most influencial"" one is easier, at least in my case it proved to be so. This book has shaped my way of thinking like no one, perhaps just ""The power of positive thinking in business"" by Scott Ventrella came close to it, but one step below.As an IT consultant I use to read mostly technical books, which of course become outdated pretty soon and their value diminishes with time without discussion. The value that ""Your road map to success"" provides is enormous because has not timeframe, I can't see it outdated anytime and provides guidance which can be life-long followed and reintepreted.I am finding myself to recommend this book to just aybody I care for. Chances are you'll do the same after you read it.Absolutely recommended."
4,Comedy as an art form,"When the skits work (which they generally do) this comedy production raises what is essentially candid camera work to an art form level. Dom Joly explores a number of themes (answering an absurdly large mobile phone, running away, cliched spy scenes) in the same way as a painter explores the themes. I would say get this collection as compared to the whole series, it has the best skits in about the right quantity.There is no ""canned laughter"" laugh track in the background - which adds kudos to the production. Also helped by some very well placed theme music... you might find yourself humming the songs long after the gags are a distant memory."
3,Size,"Nice heavy cast iron fryer but I thought I could fry smaller items in the 4-Qt, like fries for two, but the wire basket sits to high to be cost effective with the amount of oil I would have to use to fry a small amount, but thats just my opinon other than that, something of a greater amount where large amounts of oil are required this is a fine fryer."
3,Entertaining Reading,"I read this book while on a car trip in 2 days. It was entertaining, but didnt really didnt have much to say. I would recommend it to teenagers who are trying to deal with step mom or step dad."
1,Naive and simplistic,"I got this memoir recently at the library and put it down by mid-point. Chambers writes well, but doesn't have much to say. Having lived a complex and troublesome relationship with my mother (I am now 53) I found Chambers skimmed over and oftentimes left out the most critical things that happen between mothers and daughters. I attribute this to her youth. You can't write a memoir like this when you, like Chambers, are a single woman in her early twenties. As the mother of teenage daughters I can understand and sometimes forgive what I went through with my mother. Mothers and daughters need the distance, experience and maturity that years provide. When Chambers reads her own book ten years from now she will wince at the naviety of her own words"
5,Powerful tale of Overcoming Adversity and Forgiveness,"I found Mama's Girl enjoyable reading. Ms. Chambers' writing style is wonderfully descriptive, while maintaining a tone of informal conversation. I think a lot of reviewers missed the point of Ms. Chambers' novel, which was that the power of forgiveness is possible, no matter what you have faced and it is possible to overcome no matter what has been thrown in your path. Although I can relate to Ms. Chambers in many ways, including age, I personally found more of the story in the tale of her mother's ability to overcome early in the novel. Anyone who is or has struggled with family issues, should read this book. I personally, got more out of Mama's Girl than the two novels I have read by author April Sinclair who also writes coming of age novels."
5,An Adult's Review...,"An incredibly moving, REAL memoir. Veronica takes you right beside her as she grows-- through every bit of ugliness and hardship growing up in her family all the way to seeing a dream come true. I could read this again and again. I first read it in college when I was 24. Hard to put down. Very compelling and sincere-- made me want to jump in and be her friend. If you are a high school age girl, I suspect you will really enjoy this book."
3,Plate with hole in it,It's a plate with a 4 inch hole in it. not much to report. I installed in the bottom of my contractor saw as I was to lazy to make one. It probably saved me 10 minutes of work so not work much that way.Three stars as the thing should be more of a funnel. I have a 1 HP delta dust collector hooked up just to this on 6 foot tube. Not enough to pull sawdust from more than 2 inches away from center hole.
4,Table Saw Flange,"This is a great product for my table saw. It allowed me to set it up without a dust collection bag. Instead I now plug my shop vac directly to my table saw and the dust has no match. I have a 10"" craftsman table saw so with little modification to the cover it worked like a charm."
4,Good comprehensive Book on pedo,"good read and easy to follow.good tables and flowcharts in case of emergencies, traumas, abscesses, etc.couple errors in Rx'sno real info on tooth movement, uprighting (which is okay)no real info on space maintenance, TPA, ling arches, band/loop (which is not)good to have if you don't see too many kids."
4,Questionable interpretations,"Jando keeps up the good work as he records all of these demanding pieces. But there are eye-catching differences between them. For instance, he seems to have overthrown the tempo markings in Mazeppa, as he storms through the beginning and lacks the excitement through to the final. He shows his abilities in Vision, Wilde-Jagd, but then it stars to sound very flat in Chasse-neige. But overall, it is for sure that this set was recorded in great enthusiasm. I must say that the F minor (No. 10) interpretation is the best I have seen recently. I may advice Kissin's recording of 5 of these etudes (Nos. 5, 8, 10, 11, 12) together with Schumann Fantasie in addition to this CD."
4,why me,item arrived quickly and was as described. I would order from them again with confidence in their promise. Package was intact.
3,Some other fittings may not work with this fitting,"I connected some quick disconnect fittings to this Y fitting. Two of the openings in this Y were the right size, but one opening was too large. I had to cut slots in the rim of the opening and use a hose clamp to bring the size down to the correct diameter. I verified the opening diameter with several other fittings and calipers to see that the one opening was indeed bigger than the normal size.This item will normally work great if you are connecting hose directly to it, but use caution when connecting other items to it.Plastic will change shape after it has been injected and cools (like this product). Good engineering and good chemical composition will compensate for those changes. I recommend getting a different brand product instead of this one if you want quality and consistency."
2,Doesn't work for me,one of the holes is always shooting-out air no matter how I set it up. It is me or this product could be better.
3,"There was a great book in here, struggling to get out...","...past the strangely lethargic modern and Tudor heroines. What could've been two absorbing stories are dragged down by the primary characters, who never seem to progress to maturity, self-insight, nor motivation to take charge of their own lives. Their shared static quality holds back the momentum of the entire book."
4,Great,This is a great product...sometimes have issues with recognizing the software but that might be an issue with my system. Great size/weight. Great color. Reasonable market pricing.
5,SimopleTech external hard drive,"I am very satisfied with this external hard drive. It has (of course), a lot of space, and, though the speed is 5400, not 7200 rpm, it is very quick of access, and ... here's a real plus ... it doesn't get fragmented as do any internal H/D. Why? Because it is not ""actually"" a part of Windows!Also, I'm running Windows Vista Ultimate, and until I obtained this H/D, I was very limited as to what apps I could run. But I installed them on this external drive, and the only connection with Vista, is a icon on the screen! Neat, huh?Kudos to SimpleTech for this. Lastly, it was on sale at Compuplus, for $[...] off, so I paid only $[...] for it!Check out ComPuPlus, and see whether it's still on sale. Or, use Shopzilla, I found it for even less that what I paid .. on amazon. Oh, well, it's well worth the list price in my book.Barry(borear@msn.com)"
1,Needs 2 USB ports/Not very portable,"I don't recommend this if you're thinking it's an easy to use portable file transfer. It requires connection to 2 USB 2.0 ports. It does not work with a USB 2.0 hub. So, if I want to get files from my desktop, I have to pull it out of its compartment and reach around for the 2 ports. Except one of the ports is connected to my Linksys wi-fi antenna. Big hassle, with cables to printer, etc. Not a big deal for everyone, but as for me, I plan to return it."
3,It's huge -- and heavy!,"I asked for a two-sided griddle for Christmas, and got this one. I can't comment on how well it works because I plan on returning it. Read the fine print! It's huge (28"" long!) and heavy (26 lbs!!) It will only fit across my range (with a huge empty area in the middle between the two burners). Most other griddles, even other cast iron ones, are closer to 20"" and 15 or 16 lbs -- much more manageable."
3,Mailbox,It is a well made mailbox. I just wish it was a little larger on the inside so larger letters & magazines woulddrop through better.
2,Lock wore out after 4 months,"The lock wore out after only 4 months, and will need to be replaced. Also, the larger pieces of mail often don't clear the hopper, which makes the locking compartment useless for these pieces. The mailbox looks nice, but I'll be replacing it with something sturdier and better designed."
4,Much Higher quality than expected!,"I was a little taken aback by the cost of most security boxes available to me. But having had checks and other mail stolen it was still a good investment. When this Oasis Jr showed up yesterday I was pleasantly suprized. heavy guage precision fabrication (I worked in a sheet metal enclosure mfg shop for many years as a young adult), quality paint. Design handles larger pkgs than expected and the rubber door seals are aircraft quality!If it came with a mount kit it would have 5 stars. Very happy with this."
2,Ok for the money,"If you have zero tolerance for mail theft it will cost you $200 plus for a secure mailbox. Try Fort Knox boxes. If you don't believe me buy this box and try and pry it open with a large screwdriver or wonder bar. You'll realize the only reason to lock it is to keep the door from flapping in the wind.Search ""Oasis Jr Locking Mailbox Vulnerable to Fishing and Prying "" on youtube1:47 well spent"
4,Very nice mailbox,Great mailbox......more secure then some of the other mailboxes I was looking at. Lots of room; can fit days worth of mail. Didnt come with all the hardware necessary to mount so it took a trip to the hardware store. Also had to make a mounting plate out of wood in order to place it on post already in place. Not difficult just took some time.
1,Easy to Break In,I live in the country and bought one of these mailboxes because of mail theft. It has been broken into 3 times since I installed it! Lucky for us we empty it every day after the mail is delivered. It was quite apparent that the thief used a screw driver to pry open the door. The tab on the lock bends very easy. Bought it at Home Depot and wish I could return it.
2,Not for hawaii,I live by the beach in Hawaii and mine is completely rusted out after 18 months. Can't get the top to close any more and rain pours right in.
3,Worth 3.5 stars,"I'm a big fan of James Byron Huggins and have read all his books. This one is better than Nightbringer, but not as good as Hunter or Cain. Fans of Huggins should give James Rollins, Matthew Reiley and Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston a chance. Those who like the authors just mentioned should like Huggins. Huggins is not as good an author as Rollins, but his action scenes are more believable than Reiley's. Huggins is a Christian and his books are spiritual, but he doesn't bash the reader over the head with a Bible."
1,What happened to Huggins,"I have read every one on Huggins books and normally enjoy them. If I had read this book first, I would have never read another one of his. I normally do not read modern Christian fiction because it is of low quality and/or gives a very dumbed down version of Christanity. The writing and the premise was not bad, but how it was carried out was very annoying and I had echoes of Frank Peretti's cheap version of Christanity dancing through my head. I would recomend that you skip this book, but if you're like me, you'll probably read it anyway then regret it."
2,Where's the Editor?,"I thoroughly enjoyed JBH's earlier work, especially ""The Reckoning."" However, this book was of decidedly less quality. The action scenes were pretty well written, but when it came to character development, there was far too much ""tell"" and not enough ""show.""There were numerous clunky phrases, and many descriptions (especially of Jannes' history) were repeated over and over again.I was disappointed. The story could have been excellent, but instead I thought it was merely mediocre. JBH needs a far better editor to firm up his writing."
4,Worth reading,I'm a 15 year old teenager who loves Dekker's books. This was an excellent book and I really enjoyed reading it. It was worth buying and it has a very good story line.
4,Review,"It was entertaining, but I was let down by the fact that Thorn never got saved. He was able to overcome Jannes by force. The Bible says, ""We wrestle not against flesh and blood..."""
3,Not quite what I expected....,"From all the good reviews I read about this book, I thought it would at least be as good if not better than ""Hunter"" my all time favorite of Mr. Huggins' work. Instead, it was a little disappointing. The action was good but it was few and far between. The bad guys were always getting their butts kicked in their few encounters with Thorn and the Assassini. Come on, Mr. Huggins - couldn't you have made this a more even match just to make it more thrilling? Also, Christianspeak was just a bit overwhelming in this book compared to ""Hunter"". OK, we get it. This is a book about good vs. evil. But, why rub it in over and over?"
1,controlling mommy bunny,"Though a classic, this book rubbed me the wrong way from the first time I read it and the feeling hasn't changed. We have a copy that was given to us and my son sometimes asks for me to read it to him. I cringe every time. I should just get rid of it. The baby bunny wants to run away and every idea he comes up with is squashed by his mother until he is so defeated he just gives up and decides he'll stay after all. The mother bunny doesn't talk to him about what feelings are causing him to want to run away or all the reasons that running away is not a good idea nor does she try to distract him with positive attention. Instead she forces him back to her. I am sure that this baby bunny will turn into a rebellious teenage bunny because he has such a rigid, controlling mother bunny. There are many other books out there that do a much better job of portraying a mother's love. On a positive note, the color illustrations are lovely."
1,Scary Book,"This book reads like a stalker tale. I think it's completely inappropriate for children of any age. I understand the message it's trying to convey - that the mother bunny would never lose her baby - but it reads like a horrible nightmare. I don't understand why this book would ever be considered a ""classic."""
1,A Classic of Squashed Spirits,"This is another ""classic"" that is disturbing. This is a tale of a small bunny who says he is going to run away from home. His mother tells him she will pursue him.For instance, the bunny says he will become a fish and swim away. The mother says she will become a fisherman and catch him. Each of these pairs is done illustrated with a black and white drawing (very nicely done) and a color spread (too garish and lacking the detail of the black and whites).In the end, the bunny's spirit is defeated and he resolves himself to staying home with his mother (Well then, I might as well just stay home). The underlying message is that you can not get away from your mother so you may as well not even try.This is my opinion, my wife's, and the four grandparents'. Friends with children have agreed with us about the depressing nature of this so-called classic. There are plenty of better books out there for our children."
1,It's so scary...,"I think this book is awful. My little sister received it from a relative, and actually had nightmares about it. It's not a good thing to stalk your kids, seriously. Let them have a bit of autonomy and some room to grow and develop in their own ways. Heck, even if they run away, it's probably okay. I know that I would ""run away"" all the time as a kid, but I always came back, and I always learned something from the attempt. Don't smother your kids quite so much, and maybe we'll have more innovative, responsible adults in the future."
5,Great Book For Parent To Share With Their Child,I bought this book for my Neice. I read it as a child. This is a great book for a child to learn the length and extent of a parents love for a child. I like the meeting of the minds being played out in this book. I thank Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd and their families for sharing this book as well as the other stories and illustrations they have done.
4,Children's book,I needed the book for a play we are presenting. I was so happy to find the book at Amazon.com. I read the book and found it to be kinda wierd but my grandaughter liked it! It will be hers when the play is done. I love the service I get from Amazon and always go here first when I am looking for something I need.
3,Printing Error,"The book has the complete story, then a few blank pages at the end and restarts the story half way through. I'm a little hesitent to give it as a gift."
5,A great parent guide.,"This book, when read by Mom or Dad, will tell a child that no matter what, I'll always be here for you and I'll never give up looking for you. Parental love is the greatest love a child will ever feel. Great for new parents."
5,I've always loved this book.,"I've always loved this book. This was one of my favorite books for my mother to read to me when I was young. It was one of the first books that we got for our son. In fact, I bought this book for him while I was still pregnant. :) My son is now 3 years old and still enjoys it."
5,"wonderful, beautiful book",we just love this book. the illustrations are delightful and the story is very sweet.
3,Nice artwork but odd theme,"The artwork of this book is quaint, but the theme is a bit strange. A baby bunny threatening the various ways it will leave it's mother, and the mother bunny countering with all of the ways she will hunt it down or get it back. Sort of odd."
2,18 month old doesn't care for it,"Maybe my daughter is a bit too young for this book, but she does not like it and will not sit through it - even when I make up my own story and point to the pictures. I'm hoping when she's older she'll love it as much as the person who gave it to her did as a child."
2,The Runaway Bunny Book,"My daughter LOVES Goodnight Moon, so when she saw there were more books to go along with Goodnight Moon she was so excited & ready to see what would happen next. Well.....The book (Runaway Bunny) was a disappointment! Runaway Bunny is NOT comparable to Goodnight Moon. I will say, the illustration was cute & my daughter did enjoy the silly pictures but overall neither of us were impressed. We could possibly read again, but I am sure this will be in the next garage sale."
1,Wrong impression,"I am surprised I hated this book so much since it got so many great reviews. The whole book talks about the baby bunny running away from mommy bunny, while mommy bunny keeps saying I'll just find you! I would fear it would give young children the idea of running away in a supermarket, department store, or even in the neighborhood! It just isn't a pleasent story, hearing about a baby bunny who wants nothing but to run away, but in the end is so depressed at his lack of ability to run away from mommy he just gives in and stays home."
1,Bunnies do not talk.,"This book gives children the wrong impression. As we all know, bunnies do not talk, fish, climb, or run away. This is yet another one of those books that will likely ruin a young child forever. If you read it to your child, he will likely grow up to be a serial killer. Consider yourself warned."
3,An interesting book for kids!,The book goes through an interesting narrative of a bunny who wants to run away and change form. But her mother chases her and catches her every time.My 4-year daughter likes it to start with but looses interest at times in between. May be the illustrations are not colourful enough to keep her fully engaged. More real-life situations perhaps might have kept them persistently interested.
4,Daughter likes it !,My daughter loves the story and pictures. I find it alittle boring but she requests that I read it often.
5,Runaway Bunny,"Classic story; VERY good condition; almost new; lovely story for small children; colorful illustrations, easy to understand. My granddaugher loves this fun book."
2,Not a favorite for our family,"This is one of those beloved childhood classics for many people -- but, despite its reputation, it's not a favorite for our family. The mother bunny's pursuit and control of her baby seems more like persecution than tenderness -- i.e., when he becomes a fish, she catches him on a hook, not exactly a loving act. I like the one image of the baby as a bird, coming to roost in the tree his mother has become -- but otherwise, this isn't a book that portrays the kind of relationship I have (or want) with my little son."
2,Classic snoozer,"I know she's a respected author, but aside from Goodnight Moon, I find her rhythm to be flat and the storylines rather boring. I can't get through this book without wishing it would end. My daughter doesn't seem at all excited about it either. We like Sandra Boynton stuff better. Classic or not - this book is a snoozer."
3,It's OK,"I found this bood to be just ok. It isn't very inspiring and the story doesn't ""flow"" very well. My son & I much prefer to read books such as ""Is Your Mama A Llama?"" and ""Polar Bear Polar Bear What Do You Hear?"" In one part of the story, the mother bunny turns into a tight rope walker to get to her baby bunny which is a trapeze artist--doesn't even make sense!"
1,beautiful in its creepiness,"The illustrations are lovely but the whole story is just creepy to me and smothering. I think there are better books to illustrate that you'll always be there for your child and love them in a non-creepy way. I like ""Guess How Much I Love You"" or ""Kiss Goodnight"" or well almost any other book. This book just seems to squash a child's imagination with a doggedly determined mother that will go out and capture you and bring back where you belong."
2,Not My Favorite Book,"I bought this book for my 17 mo old b/c he is quite obsessed with Goodnight Moon and I like the black and white and color illustrations in both. I knew what The Runaway Bunny was about, but I don't feel that comfortable reading it to my child.I understand that children need to feel secure in their world and know that their mothers are there for them. I understand that that is the book's message, I also feel like I am telling my child that I will thwart his attempts at independence.I don't want him to think that is what mothers want for their children. I feel compelled to clarify this for him as I read it.The illustrations are great though. A better book that deals with a child's autonomy is ""I Love You Stinky Face""."
3,Times change,"I read this book to my daughter at least twice a day. As a fly fisherman and mountain climber who gardens, I like the illustrations. But the message is plainly mawkish and based on values that don't work today.As a dad and primary caregiver, I'm tired of Brown's world in which only boys matter and only mothers are around. And mocking a child's ambition cheats that child and innures it to arbitrary authority. You don't have to belittle a child to demonstrate your unending love and fortitude.As an adult I appreciate the wit and quirkiness of the story, so I have no problems mixing the genders when I read it aloud. But the book's going out with the trash when my daughter is old enough to comprehend and read for herself."
2,Runaway from this book,"I'm sorry to be so negative but I don't really like this book. The story seems to long and the pictures are kind of weird. AFter reading and loving Goodnight Moon, I found this story not at all interesting and it felt like it was just thrown together.My little one loses interest in this book about halfway through so we have never read it in one sitting.Borrow this."
2,For Overprotective Moms,"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyThis imaginative book reassures children that Mom will always love them and be there for them, even if they are angry or feel like running away. Yet, I find it unsettling how the mother bunny is so determined to undermine her child's sense of independence. One line is particularly disturbing: the little bunny says he will become a sailboat and sail away, and the mother answers, ""I will become the wind and blow you where I want you to go."" I'm not a psychologist or anything, but this line seems so controlling - not a message I want to give my child."
2,What is the message here?,"I have read it a few times because my son likes it. Every time I read it, I like it less. Here is the message I get from the book:Don't spread your wings... because if you do, I'm coming to clip them.It reminds me of the lyrics from Pink Floyd's ""Mother"".Mother (1994 Digital Remaster)"
2,Not a good one...,It's a book about how a little bunny is trying desperately to get away from his mother. Wish I hadn't bought.
4,"Book's Good, but the CD Rocks!!!","All the children to whom I have given this book enjoy it very much. However, I also always give the book along with the CD. With Brook Shields narrating, and wonderful music, the CD makes the book ""read along"" in a way that every child seems to really enjoy. I highly recommend the music/narrated version as well. Together, they are a great gift. I reall like the Brooke SHields/Glen Roven version.The Runaway Bunny/Paddington Bear's First Concert/Tubby the Tuba"
5,forever love,"This book is a classic, and really expresses the mother bunny's love; she will go anywhere to express her love to the little bunny. (appropriate to be read to preschoolers or kindergarteners)"
5,Fanciful and reassuring,"Too soon, kids get to the stage where they would be horrified (on the surface) if Mom stayed right with them, no matter how they traveled or changed. Luckily, Margaret Wise Brown was writing for the preschool group that is just becoming aware of their own separate indentity, and they're not sure what to make of it. I really love how the mother bunny matches the child imagination for imagination, and feel strong affection for the last bit when the little bunny, clearly outmatched, but clearly reassured, says that he might has well stay right there and be her little bunny. Her reply, ""Have another carrot."" is both humorous and poignant."
5,Cute book,"This book is very cute and my daughter loves it. I am glad it is in board book format since she loves to chew the edges of the pages. The pictures are darling and the story is so sweet. It's a lovely tale about the relationship between a mother and her child. Every other spread is in color, like Goodnight Moon, and my daughter seems to love the contrast."
5,Wonderful book on tape,"My children love to listen to this story. After the story is read on track one, it is performed by two folk musicians on track 2. We are really enjoying it."
3,Synopsis,"Rankil is marked for life - destined for abuse and neglect at the hands of the Autlach. In her world, the worst that can happen to a Taelach child is not death - but life itself. And even though sister Taelachs constantly search for the younger Taelach children, Rankil is so far yet undiscovered.Join Rankil on her journey to find a home where she is welcomed and where love is at least a possibility in this long - awaited sequel to No Sister of Mine."
1,still waiting,A few weeks ago I ordered a swiss army knife and it was not the one I wanted. I called the company that I had ordered it from and they said to send it back and they would try to get me the model I wanted. I asked for an RA number and they said I did not need one. This was a mistake because it has been weeks and I have not heard anything. My credit card was charged for thirty some dollars and I do not have anything to show for it.
1,Don't waste your time or your money.,"I think this book was really dumb, and here's why. First off it moved very slow, and the story was very dull. Second, it's almost like Swanwick is trying to be controversial. His short fiction is very good (""Ancestral Voices"" in the August issue of Asimov's Science Fiction -written with Gardner Dozois- was one of the best stories I have read in a long time) but this book lacks everthing that made ""...Voices"" good. This book did not deserve the Hugo nomination, and I am glad that it did not win. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Strong start - loses momentum,"For me, the most striking thing about this novel is the way that it is written. After reading through various descriptions of writing genre, I'd say it was ""Lovecraftian"" (but hey, I'm not a literary critic by trade - I'd be interested anyone who can share with me the correct description of the style).The book plot promises a more exciting read than I feel it ultimately delivered. It starts strong and engaging, but somehow loses its way midway though the book and by the end of the book its as if the author cut out the last 50% and replaced it with a vision of what was to come.So overall, I finished this book dissappointed that a story with such great potential and a quick & engaging writing style was somehow squandered by the author wasting space with what seemed to me irrelevancies and then rushing the conclusion.Three stars."
1,"Been there, done that...","I can see why none of the larger conservative publishers wanted to put this out. And don't give me that ""liberal media "" bunk. While a poorly written book, it's better than most of the hack jobs that come out on Regnery (his former publisher) or Sentinal, Crown Forum and WND for example. But really, this is just a dull book. I'm a democrat, and would probably be considered liberal by Mr. Aldrich. But that doesn't mean I'm a blind sheep who doesn't see the corruption of politicians on all sides at the top. That's the problem with books like these. It almost reads like a superhero drama with the Republicans and conservatives as our valiant heros, and the Democrats and liberals as villians. When you start with a premise that small minded and immature, you come out with a poorly grounded book like this."
2,Another rant from one of the polar crusaders.,"Every political book that is released these days, apart from being unconditionally lauded by the leading newspapers, reeks of politcal polarity where the authours tout the general reader to whichever end of the political spectrum they associate with, using petty ad hominem attacks and facile moral oneupsmanship. The result is a thinning of genuine political discusion where policy issues and direction are argued with their 'team' and the associated policy bagage in mind and not considered reason and concesional admittance where it is due.Thunder on the Left is no exception, if you root for the reds, you'll love this book, if you barrack for the blues, try Hillary's Living History.N.B. to barrack is Australian for shouting support for your team."
3,From Back Cover,"Josie Jackson isn't really a hot babe. The skimpy outfit and sexy come-on are meant to scare off Bob -- her sister's latest pick of boring blind dates. But wow -- Bob is far from boring. Instant lust leads to a night of incredible passion . . . and a morning surprise. ""Bob"" isn't Bob. He's advertising exec Nick Harris. And that lust? It might really be love . . ."
1,Sticker,Be aware the door is plastic and they place a sticker on it that cannot be removed without damaging the plastic. I sure wish I had just returned to Target.
4,Panasonic or Sharp? The Light Made the Difference,"I've had this microwave for three weeks and am very pleased. I previously owned a Panasonic which performed well but died after 3 years.I decided on the Sharp based on very good reviews but most of all because of the utility light that turns on when the door is opened and during cooking. The Panasonic was only lighted during cooking; I found it inconvenient to check food ""in the dark"" when I opened the door.The door does have a loud, distinct ""clunk"" upon closing. I find it noticeable but not disturbing.The Sharp has the utility light, cooks well, has good defrost features, and a very fast (one touch) minute button for cooking. I'm glad I chose the Sharp over the Panasonic."
3,Not so good,"Cons: The front door closes very loud.All buttons are the same size and too small. Clear and Start buttons are in the middle between the others and the only difference is that they have these words on them. It makes difficult to press these buttons without reading where they are.The ""window"" on the front door is not sturdy, it is made of a flexible material (some kind of the foil maybe).This was a replacement for my SHARP 1-Cubic-Foot 1100-Watt Microwave Oven from 1994 and I am disappointed that they degraded the quality.Pros: It warms the food fast."
2,Power Level can't be entered directly,"If you use microwave oven to defrost and you'd like to enter the time and power level directly, good luck. On my old oven, I go Time -> 2:00 -> Power -> 3 -> Start. On this oven, the power level can't be entered directly. You have to press the Power Level 7 or 8 times to get it down to 30%. Terrible usability."
4,Very good,An excellent book full of nice candle rituals to perform. Some may not be to others likings there are some spells in here that do not follow the witches rede but there are some in every book right? I recommend this to anyone who already has a range of herbs etc as many rituals in this book require them.
2,Kinda Insulting,"You know I really loved his other book,Basic Magick.But this book he basically tells you forget everything you know and listen to me,there's a part in it where he's talking about how ""silly"" it is to draw circles of protection around you before rituals,I like to do the LBRP and he says quote""I pitty those"" so I was kinda insulted through the whole thing. I'm very proud of my magickal background and he just honestly sounds very insecure and you can tell he really wants you to believe in his way of work,I guess there really is no ""wrong way""but I do belive in karma and when he says thats rediculous I get kinda confused cause any good magician should be aware of what there putting out is going to come back in some way. Basic Magick is a pretty good book of his but I really don't reccomend this one,The spells are kinda dangerous for someone who might be begining or doesn't know a whole lot about magick.Sorry to drop the bad news but I think you should know."
1,"This author reviews his own books as if he's a ""Customer""","I mostly liked this author before, but it *seems* that this author has taken to writing ""Customer Reviews"" of his/her? own works! That's pretty darn lame. He/she should at least acknowledge their status as author in the review, if they had any integrity."
2,Bored Without the Fretboard...,"This is the heelball sequel to my favorite cdrom, Guitar Method 1. It shares many songs with the original version! Why would anyone want to buy the same information twice?I wish I could say what it does have is the worst part, but it isn't. This software doesn't include the animated fret board. This is a moving picture that shows you exactly how to play a song. It was the reason I bought the cd I was stunned that the best feature from the first edition was omitted!Even so, there are new techniques to be learned here. Even so, their Blues or Guitar Songs offerings are probably better picks. Less expensive too!!s"
2,Not worthy of the cost,"I bought this book today.After going thru it, I found that its not worthy of the price $33. It doesn't handle REXX+ISPF programming part.Just a good tool for writting simple REXX programs"
2,Not on my bookshelf anymore ......,I would not recommend this book due to anyone with any hope of understanding this fickle and sometimes difficult language. There are some thing the author does not cover and some she giggles over like a schoolgirl. I don't think she has a full grasp of reality yet alone the subject.
1,Smells bad,"Do not believe in positive reviews if the reviewers reviewed only one item. I am a long time Amazon shopper and I tell you honest opinion. I have a brand new bottle of Wisteria in my trash can right now. It smells really bad. I will stick to Essenza. I had other products from Scentual Expressions as gift (but I don't know exact product names). They all smell cheap (bad). Whatever you buy, smell them first."
3,more like 2 and a half,"this has all the Leonard character trademarks. It's Quirky, dangerous, sleazy, funny etc... same with the dialoge,unsual plot and intermittent violence. but it lacks anyone to care anything about. The main character, Dennis, could be someone to relate to but he's just not enough of a presence. And I didn't find myself caring one way or another about the rest. As for plot, you really don't get any kind of handle on what's happening or is going to happen untill around page 180. By then its all so messy you just don't care. I'm not the kind of reader who needs to be led hand in hand from one point to the next, but I just found myself asking too often ""what's the point?"" Its Leonard allright, just not enough."
2,Very disappointing novel from a good writer,"I looked forward to this novel being familiar with the author and the fabulous review snippets on the inside on the front cover. I found the plot to be shallow and every charachter a stereotype. What does the long digression into ""blues history and theory"" have to do with the plot? Why do the antagonists wait for a civil war reanactment to have their battle, why not just have a shoot-out in the bar? The main character, Dennis, is strangely passive and loved by all, for no apparent reason.Southernors are dumb, blacks are hip and mexicans street smart.Read some of Leonard's early works not this one."
3,Not His Best...,The story just plodded along & although I found the characters to be well developed; I was just plain bored throughout most of the book.I speak RedNeck fairly fluently & frequently found the dialog difficult to follow.I much prefer stories like Get Shorty & Be Cool!If you love Elmore Leonard & can get a copy of this book on the cheap; well...
3,a good read,"This book by Elmore Leonard is an intereting read, though highly improbable. The characters are sketched out so you come to know them and even like many of them, even again, some of the ""bad guys."" You have to keep turning the pages to see what happens next particularly to one of the characters. Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Blues,"I am a long term and dedicated Leonard fan. However, Tishomingo Blues is quite a disappointment. The work lacks the taught style, clarity and purpose of his best work. The plot wanders around a Civil War reenactment (which itself is more a gimic than a plot enhancer) with a number of characters who seem, and are, unconnected to the direction of whatever action there is. I long for the good old days of Out of Sight."
3,"Good start, then fizzle.","I agree with Rob Stone below. After an investment of about 170 pages, I totally lost interest in these characters. All the hip, dead-on dialogue began running together, as did the bad guys. I realized I just no longer cared what happened to anyone.Leonard was at his best in the early to mid-80s with Glitz, Killshot, and La Brava. Those books worked because they were genuine thrillers -- you really cared about the protagonists, and the climaxes were as thrilling as good crime fiction gets.But starting with, I'd say, Get Shorty, Leonard has been coasting on cool, writing colorful and borderline-humorous thrillers instead of realistic and unbearably suspenseful ones. I suppose if that's the sort of thriller you want, then the current Leonard is for you.But I miss books with the intensity and thrills of Glitz, his very best by far."
5,Elmore Leonard at his best,"I am a huge Elmore Leonard fan, having read nearly all of his books, and Tishomingo is hands down my favorite novel that Leonard has written."
1,Another Disappointing Leonard Novel,"Humorous mysteries and fantasies can provide wonderful laugh-aloud reading, and I especially like the ones with a serious undertone (Elizabeth Peters' ""Amelia Peabody"" adventures, Terry Pratchett's Discworld, and so on). I keep hearing that Elmore Leonard writes them, but he doesn't. This novel hasn't a single saving grace. I often donate my used mysteries to church for resale--but not this one. If you enjoy a cast of entirely conscienceless, immoral characters, a stultifying plot, and an easy-to-spot solution, be my guest. But if you enjoy a good mystery (and there are plenty of good ones out there), you shouldn't bother with this book."
2,I DESERVE A MEDAL FOR FINISHING THIS BOOK,"Plain hard work all the way through. What on earth was going on, and why should I care less anyway? It was slow and at times incomprehensible; I got lost with whole passages of the dialogue: it seemed to be written in a foreign language at times.Strangely, I did like the main character Dennis. If this writer is good at anything to do with writing then it must be in creating believable and sympathetic characters.But the story was utter boring rubbish, with a long and tedious build up to a pathetic little shoot out. All the baddies get killed and the goodies (who were baddies too, but not so bad) survived. HOORAY !! But by the end I was hoping they would all get shot.What a waste of time."
2,Weird...,"A high-diver performer witnesses a murder while standing on top of his dive ladder, and he tries to decide whether to admit to it or not. Meanwhile, he's befriended by a black guy who is trying to move into the drug business in this small town. His plan is to kill off the main people currently running it during a Civil War reenactment. Weird plot twists and you never know what is going on until it happens. Didn't care much for it."
1,"poorly written, irritatingly lame literature","This book was so bad, I sped thru reading it just to be done with it. It's poorly written, poorly thought out...just garbage basically...in content & form. Hated it! And he gets even worse marks for trying to write about/in a southern dialect because not only was it incorrect, but terribly inconsistent!"
2,More style than substance,I have to disagree with most of the reviewers on this page. I've long been an Elmore Leonard fan and appreciate his lean writing style and clever plotting. But it seems to me that with his last couple of novels he's been leaning heavily on his style and shorting us on substance. All flash but not much you can sink your teeth into. Compare this novel with his earlier stuff and it comes up sadly lacking. I hope he gets back to form with his next book.
4,I have a confession...I can't follow Leonard's plotlines,"Every word Elmore Leonard ever wrote is engaging and clever...but true confessions time, I don't understand about half of it. The plot of Tishomingo Blues has something to do with some Detroit gangsters using a Civil War battle re-enactment as the venue for shooting up some Mississippi gangsters. Why they didn't just take a gun to the offending parties, I can't say. It would have saved at least 100 pages. About half way through I lost track of who was doing what to whom. I finished it but I still don't know. If you crave resolution in the plots to your thrillers you had better avoid this one."
2,Firing Blanks,The master of dialogue misfires this time out. A strangely passive protagonist mixes with civil war reenactors with little heat or passion.
4,"The South Shall Rise Again! Oops, maybe not.","A twisted, funny, dark plot with very real charactersOverview:High diver witnesses murder and gets in the middle of mayhem involving the Dixie Mafia, a gangster from Detroit, and a Civil War reenactment.Opinion:Since I am from the area, the setting of this story (Tunica, MS) helped my enjoyment of this book.Leonard's character development is right on. The array of personalities interwoven with twisted plots seem to be a Leonard trademark.I reads much like 'Get Shorty' with the plot matched to a different setting and characters consistent with the new setting.If you enjoy serious books, this is not for you....pure dark humormed entertainment here.Enjoy."
4,Good but not memorable,"I had never read a book by Elmore Leonard, so all I knew about him was his famous advice to writers: ""leave out all the boring parts.""What I liked about ""Tishomingo Blues"" was that it didn't follow your standard mystery format: good guys, bad guys, love interest, good-guy-who's-really-a-bad-guy, etc. Every character is a hustler working an angle, a good guy and a bad guy, so I never knew what was coming next. Leonard also has a great ear for dialogue, and the book moves quickly and is funny in parts. He left out all the boring parts.The reason I give it 4 stars is that it's not memorable. It's a fun way to kill a few hours, but I have the feeling I'll have forgotten all the characters and plot points within a week. Not a bad book, just not important."
4,"An enjoyable read, consistent Elmore Leonard","If you like Elmore Leonard you won't be disappointed by this title. This is in his classic style: character-driven gritty crime stories, with lots of interesting background. You can mostly see this one coming, but it doesn't matter; you really enjoy the trip to get there. Adding new and interesting elements such as the Civil War reenactments and the drug-dealing Dixie mafia make the story interesting. You'll enjoy all the characters - the protagionist high-diver, the slick Robert Taylor, and especially the washed up (retired?) ex-major league pitcher Charlie, who just can't stop talking about himself! The audio version of this book gives Charlie an authentically nasal Michigan accent to boot, courtesy narrator Frank Muller, who does great work here, not brooding like his other narrations.Elmore scores another hit with this title...not a five star, but that's not what Elmore's looking for either."
5,"Worth it just to learn the word ""farb""","Leonard is a master and I loved this book. I've been reading him since '67 (""The Big Bounce"") and he never disappoints. In this one, the unique, utterly original setting (the Civil War re-enactment) was a match for the masterful dialogue, so that you're dazzled and amazed by both. And it's worth the price, just to learn the word ""farb."" Now I just have to figure out how to work it into a converation."
4,Take the Plunge,"This is a wild ride! Elmore Leonard introduces some of the quirkiest characters that you'll ever come across. The book would have earned a fifth star from me if he would have delved even more into the backgrounds of these crazy folks. A traveling high dive artist gets hooked up with a yankee con man in the South and lands smack dab in the middle of a Civil War reenactment that pits a northern godfather wannabe against the Dixie Mafia. The sidekick thugs on both sides of this battle will keep you shaking your head in disbelief. Nothing to be taken seriously. You'll have fun with it!---Robert John Estko, author of the suspense thriller EVIL, BE GONE."
4,He keeps cranking good ones out.,"What do a high-diver, drug dealers, a southern resort hotel, and a civil war re-enactment have in common? Elmore Leonard. That's as much of the plot as you need. This is Leonard in true form again, with a cast of colorful characters, GREAT dialogue, and some nasty goings-on. I listened to the audio CD of this. It was abridged but, at over six hours, I think I got the gist of it. Paul Rudd does a great job of performing it."
3,Don't Expect Another GLITZ or GET SHORTY,"Most of the action in TISHOMINGO BLUES takes place in the vicinity of Tunica, Mississippi. The main characters are an exhibition high diver named Dennis Lenahan and a black con artist from Detroit named Robert Taylor. The best part of the book is probably Leonard's description of a reenactment of a Civil War battle. The story's ending is slightly reminiscent of the final scene in the movie CASABLANCA.TISHOMINGO BLUES appears to be written by formula and it takes a long time to capture the reader's interest. If you are expecting another GLITZ or GET SHORTY, you will be disappointed. But if you just want to relax with a fairly good mystery, TISHOMINGO BLUES may well fill the bill."
3,Not my type of book,"A thriller, not a whodunnit, set in messy Mississippi. Dennis, a show diver, comes to town to dive at the Casino. Robert Taylor, a smooth talking blues fan from Detroit, comes with his own agenda. The characters are very colourful if not highly original, and there's definitely room for a few laughs as the plot unfolds. But, unfortunately, not my type of book."
2,Audio Review - Audio Cd narrator AWFUL,"I read this book, when it first came out in hardcover and picked it up again from a borrowing library when it was there in paperback and I think this is a great Elmore Leonard story. I decided recently to get the cd version so I could experience the story in my car one more time. The story is great - 5+ stars, however the narrator on the multi cd set leaves something to be desired. He certainly can read well, and had good pacing, except, he does a bunch of imitations! Instead of creating unique characters he does Bernie Mac, Billy Bob Thorton, and more - even though those voices do not fit the characters being talked about. Like the ultimate fantasy castint by the reader. Sure, he does a good Bernie Mac, but c'mon it doesn't lend itself to the character and just because a Casino guy is named Billy - does that mean you have to make him speak in a bad ""Sling Blade"" parody. A wonderful book audibly ruined."
3,"copied from Scientific American, March 1997","We are all made of stardust, but the story of how supernova debris became planets and people is neither simple nor fully understood. Harry McSween, a geologist by trade, begins his story with the accretion and evolution of the earth and follows it to the relatively recent development of its thin skin of living creatures. His narrative traces both planetary history and the history of the sciences that have enabled us to understand where we came from"
1,very HARD to finish,"This book just had a very misleading premise...The tagline of the book says ""Who ever said the search for Mr. Right would be easy."" This book isn't about finding Mr. Right...The heroine finds one guy -- that she sticks with through the whole book -- and at some point they're magically in love...they fight...and get back together(don't worry I'm not really giving anything away)....at some point they suddenly decide they're in love..very difficult to believe. about half of the book is devoted to the heroine's work and career life. If it's not talking about her career and depression over losing her job -- it's about her taking drugs with her roommater. There is a whole section on law, her education, and all the million jobs she has every had. The book is also not very funny...and definitely not cutesy. Not the fun ""chick lit"" I had expected this book to be."
5,Poseidon,"2 thumbs up!!!!! great remake of a great movie,I will be watching this movie again.All my movies come from Amazon."
3,Could have been...,"This could have been a great movie. Even though it had impressive special effects, it just didn't have the cast. The movie was too short. It should have spent more time building on the characters. Like I said, it could have been a really great movie."
3,"what goes up, must go down","did we really need a remake or altered version?--sure, why not. POSEIDON is not a bad movie, its just a popcorn movie. you know the story(hopefully) and what it does is not dissapoint. wave, ship down(upside down) and the ways people die. nice cast, great special effects and yeah, we care about some(not all) of the survivors. as a consumer, you make the choice-you want deaths(there are aplenty)special effect top notch!! storyline?, its nothing but will I or can I survive. entertainment?---yeah, I enjoyed it--and its nice to see that NOT all of the major stars survive. go see it on the cheap-(rent from your library the original). it is what it is, and nothin more than time spent."
1,If you enjoyed the original Poseidon Adventure...,"You may want to skip this version. Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Roddy MacDowell, the recently departed Red Buttons and the incredible Gene Hackman made the original disaster film memorable, fun and exciting. Special effects have come a long way since then but I was very disappointed with the new film. I adore Richard Dreyfuss but I thought his skills were wasted in this film. The originial story line was much more exciting and I remember being on the edge of my seat watching it in the theater.I wasn't able to see the latest in a theater and I'll admit that may have jaded my opinion some. It's definitely the kind of movie best viewed on the big screen. Whether you enjoyed this film or not, I'd still suggest that you rent the original. It's a classic in the disaster genre of that time."
3,good disaster movie,"this movie gets a lot of badmouthing because of the premiss that only a few people survive. get past that, folks...this is not taken from real life events. it is a movie, for entertainment. i would honestly give it 3.5 stars, but you do not have that feature on here. it is fun, exciting. i love that the actors do the majority of their own stunts, even the little kid. it is a big bold flashy over the top movie. just the thing for a rainy afternoon."
5,Waves of Excitement,This film has excellent special effects and an excellent cast. It's fun to watch and at times makes one's heart race.
5,Nice Effects and great movie!,I just got done watching this movie a couple nights ago. It was a great movie! The visual effects were outstanding and the plot and characters were awesome! It was really fun watching this movie and I highly recommend it!!!
3,lacking substance,"I found Poseidon to be a film that had great special effects but hardly anything was done to make the characters interesting. They just appeared there and we were expected to care about them surviving the sinking ship.The beginning of the film is supposed to be when we get to know and care about all the main characters, but hardly anything was done to make them worth caring about. So when they were running towards the top of the ship in an attempt to escape the rising flood, it just wasn't that great. I DID care about that little boy who almost didn't make it towards the end of the film. That was a memorable segment.I can't deny the special effects are really good, and watching the movie on DVD is a whole other experience with the incredibly loud sounds of waves crashing against the boat and all sorts of ship destruction, but besides that, the film was pretty average and didn't tell as good a story as it probably should have."
3,Standard action movie,"I remember liking the 1972 version very much, but it's been too long since I saw it for me to compare this remake with it. However, this movie is mostly a standard action movie. It has spectacular special effects and provides 100 minutes of entertainment, but it's not going to give a lasting impression. The characters are all forgettable and I never really felt like I cared much about them. Who can forget Shelley Winters or Gene Hackman from the original version? I doubt if by next week I'll remember Kurt Russell or whatshername's performance in this one.""Poseidon"" may be worth renting but it's not a film you need to have in your collection."
2,swallow,"The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat. The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop. The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development.Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable."
2,Can't bring myself to say more,"I love a good action movie. Love them. So what weent wrong? Well, the effects were there, but it all seemed so detached. We may have seen most of the action sequences you can do on a ship previously, or we may not. Bottom line is this: if you are going to have an action sequence, make it exciting. Watching the DVD of this, I wasn't able to be drawn in sufficiently to keep me from checking my email. At less than 100 minutes in length.A boring action movie is just plain wrong, and that's what Poseidon is."
3,POSEIDON -2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION,"I GUESS I DIDN'T CHECK THE DETAILS CLOSE ENOUGH, BUT YOU WOULD THINK A ""2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION,"" WOULD INCLUDE A FEW ""DELETED SCENES?"" NOT A ONE! THE SECOND DISC INCLUDES A LOT THAT IS ON THE FIRST DISC, A HISTORY CHANNEL SPECIAL ON ROGUE WAVES. NOT ONE DELETED SCENE ON EITHER DISC! VERY DISAPPOINTED, THOUGH, OF COURSE, IT IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE WITH GREAT STATE-OF-THE-ART SPECIAL EFFECTS. BUT, I SURE EXPECTED MORE!-MUZZY"
3,Watch it for the special effects....and nothing else.,"You know the story. A cruise ship turns upside down due to a rogue wave. Everyone now walks on ceilings, and the only way out of here is to travel upwards until the bottom of the ship (technically the top of the now-sunken ship) is reached. I've seen both the original 1972 version and this new 2006 remake, and I have to say that I prefer the original. Poseidon isn't really terrible, but it has plenty of faults. The acting is poor, the characters are unlikable, and the dialogue feels forced. The special effects, however, are much better than the effects in the original. There is a lot of computer effects that almost look real.I guess you can say that I found this to be an adequate film overall. It doesn't live up to the original, but it's worth it if you're looking for a standard popcorn movie.Grade: 5.8/10"
4,Pretty good.,The special effects are great and the plot is rather like the original except it is very slick. Enjoyable.
3,About th same as 1st one,"No real suprizes, felt like I just watched the 1st one again, a little better special effects, that is about it."
1,It's bored!!!,I SAW THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS BORED. I THOUGHT IT WAS MAGNIFICENT BUT IT'S NOT. NO COMMENT.
2,Missed Opportunity,"This so called remake completely missed the boat. Solid performances by Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are wasted with a poor supporting cast and little to no suspense. The special effects are good, but the script is so weak that it can't save this movie. You are much better served watching the original!"
4,I thought they did a great job remaking this!!,I think they did a great job remaking this movie and that because of the new CG's used in the film it was much more realistic than the original. It's definitely a movie that I'll watch again!!
2,"They tried, but...","it just didn't live up to the original made in 1972. The special effects were better, but you had no real feel for the characters. They were one-dimensional and quite predictable.In the original, each character had a 'sub-plot' that added to the richness and enjoyment of the movie. In this one, you just get the special effects and not much else.Some things are better left alone. They should have either tried harder or given up on this substandard remake."
1,This movie sucks.,"This movie really was a load of garbage. I will never get that time back, what a waste. Do not bother with this, not even to rent. This sucks.Phil. TCBRN, Simpsonville, SC."
2,Poseidon,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be something like Titanic, but I was wrong. This movie is also about a ship that sinks but only here almost everybody dies in the first twenty minutes of the movie. Only 6 or 7 people survive. I thought it wasn't that interesting. It's not worth watching on a big screen."
3,"They left out ""Adventure""","While some of the special effects are better, at least during the brief capsizing sequence, Poseidon is in no other way as good as Irwin Allen's Poseidon Adventure. That earlier version was far more faithful to Paul Galico's novel, and part of the appeal was the all star cast giving Oscar-winning performances. In this new exploitation, they've left out many important characters and updated the script with political ""correctness,"" leaving out, for instance, all references to religion. This would be tolerable if they'd improved the story in some way, but they've added nothing original or imaginative, the plot's predictable, characters stereotyped, and it just seems like an action movie knock-off rather than ""adventure,"" so no wonder they dropped that word from the title."
2,DESPERATELY LACKING CHARISMATIC LEADS TO KEEP IT AFLOAT...,"... unless your main focus when watching a movie are CGI effects, this one's strictly a Blockbuster special... Kurt Russell isn't exactly Mr. Charisma, and everybody else seems to have won their roles through D-list central casting... I was really looking forward to seeing this one, and I usually buy highly-anticipated DVDs, but I'm glad I only rented it... I gave it an extra star for the great special effects... the capsizing scenes will leave you wondering how many people were injured during the making of this movie."
4,Enjoyable,I saw the original movie of the Poseidon and this movie was a enjoyable remake of the original movie. Of course with Blu-ray it made me feel like I was on the ship with them. It was a good movie that I could look at again.
3,"A special FX thrill ride, but not a thriller","The film transfer of this disk is excellent. The DVD 'extras' focus on special effects work only.The movie itself has excellent effects however the main digital effect, the opening scenes of the SS Poseidon at sea with one of our heroes jogging around the decks, is technically top notch, unfortunately it's just not as good as real footage.The storyline is wham bam disaster movie fare with plenty of edge of your seat moments. But remember it's a thrill ride, not a thriller. When you get off the roller coaster, that's it. Still hat's off to the whole production team, the ride was exciting."
3,Better than the First,"I did enjoy the first take on this story with Gene Hackman but I must say I enjoyed this version better. However, since I already knew the story it felt like that sense of excitement was almost taken away. It's an excellent movie with pretty cool special effects."
2,A 3-hour film in just 99 minutes.,"""The Poseidon"" does have a titanic cast, but please be warned: This is NOT a Epic Award-winning tearjerker. Don't expect to hear any Celine Dion songs or dead frozen bodies washed ashore. This movie was put together by computer geeks who knows what they are doing, and These geeks now works for Warn-A Brother Studios, The producers of the film. This movie does have a good ending; Only 7 survivors were rescued at the end. There's a high-brow to this movie: Stacey Ferguson (a.k.a Fergie-From The Black-Eye Peas) Gave us some affectionate eye-candy as the singer of the Big-Band that ranged in the new year-as the titanic ship has met its fate."
1,Boring,"I am a person that can easily be pleased. It does not take too much to satisfy me. I like many movies that many people hate. But this movie is garbage. The only thing worth watching was the rogue wave hitting the ship....everything else was average at best...nothing you havent seen in thousands of other movies before.Since I am a movie freak and can easily be pleased, saying this movie sucks is really saying something. Not only should I get a refund for this garbage DVD, I should be comopensated for time lost watching this garbage.....I would say about $300 would cover it.I wouldnt even want to recieve or give this as a gift. Anyone who attempts to give this DVD as a gift should be ashamed of themselves. A pack of gum would be a better gift."
3,"It was ok, thats it...","I just got this dvd in the mail today, along with 'Silent Hill' and I really already had an idea on how this movie was going to play its self out. These types of movies you kinda know how the plot will end. Anyway, it was an ok movie, like many reviewers say here, the Computer graphics was amazing. The only thing I hated about this moving was at the begining it was too much about romance and the love boat type feeling. I mean, really come on, lets just see some normal conversations taking place. Anyway, I give this movie three stars, because its was just ok. It was pretty intense at many times during the time the ship was turing over and there after. I bought this movie, because I thought it would be a good movie to watch several times down the road. I can tell now, that I doupt after my second time watching it, I will want to see it again. Overall, this is a good one time watch movie, so you might want to rent it, if you think you want watch it many times over."
1,Save yourself!,"OK, the ship turning upside down was almost interesting, but the film had no plot, no back story, and poor acting. I felt like the Richard Dryfus character...I wanted to jump overboard.This was a horrible film! Save your time and buythe Poseidon Adventure on DVD!"
4,Its a good action movie,"I was very keen on the early Poseidon adventure which I liked. So I was keen to see what Wolgang Petersen, a director I do like, could do with the story.It found it to being a good movie. It did keep the viewers interests as our heroes go from one episode to the next. So much so I lost track of time throughout the movie.Having said that this movie has to be compared to the 1972 effort. In which case, I would have to say like so many copies that its not as good as the original. The characters are not so interesting nor is the acting. The story was better explained in the first one and more believable. The special effects are approximately as good. The filming however is better as the newer technology shows.Still it is worth looking at."
2,A real weak and empty movie.,"In my opinion, this is really a shallow, insipid and utterly stupid movie, even by Wolgang Petersen's standards.... Iwas extremely dissapointeds withe the mess. You simply don't care if any of the characters will survive or all of them will die. And as for the impossibility of 99% of the things that happen in the movie, well, it's just escapism, but they exaggerated a LOT in this department..."
2,"Watchable, but nothing more","Poseidon was a watchable movie, but was nothing worth watching again. From the original Posidion Adventure, and the TV remake of the Posidion Adventure where a cruise ship was flipped by terrorists, I think most people knew what to expect from this movie. Beyond the fast pace plot, which was way too fast in spots, the movie lacked character development, dialogue, and they could have at least filmed an actual cruise ship instead of that video game like opening sequence with the CGI ship."
5,Really Great on the IMAX screen,The most fun I've had this summer. The ship turns over quickly and then from then on it's just one exciting thing after another. Seeing the wave on the IMAX screen was incredible and when the ship turned over people were screaming! This was great!
4,fresh take on the poseidon adventure story,"I like the idea behind this movie. Yes it's a remake of the original but it's not a direct remake. They took the story of the original and made it fresh taking place in today's world with new characters. With this movie you get to see more of the ship ,crew and passengers get turned upside down. What I didnt like was the fact the movie is suppose to take place new years eve 2005 i believe and no one bothered to sent a s.o.s text message from a cell phone lol."
4,AN ADVENTUROUS VOYAGE!!,"i really liked this movie, it was pretty good. the whole ship going upside down, having to find a way out before the ship sinks, and only a handful survive. i enjoyed it from beginning to end. the jumping, the climbing, and the swimming they did throughout the whole ship to get to their destination was nicely done. i do recommend because it has that good combination of action and suspense to draw you in. josh lucas was is a very good actor and here he just proved it again. something charming about this guy, and they way he just falls into the leadership role, and becomes the hero. kurt russell, the doting father, has to get through it with his daughter. he hasn't lost his touch. the small appearance of fergie was widely viewed as well. it wasn't another big ship sinks movie, but a story of survival, in one of the worst case scenarios. i do recommend."
3,good special effects... but thats it,"ok, the poseidon turns upside-down, (in ten mintues of the film) so you dont get to any one, and its really confusing. first, valentinte dies because of that old man, (in 2 min. of the capsizing) its hard to explain, but this movies blah. watch titanic. its actually ""fun"" to watch. p.s the special effects are too good. wolfgang might think its good, but its too gory for my liking.(and im a boy)."
2,Hardly worth a viewing,"With less plot than a video game, and not much acting to be had, this movie's only saving grace are the special effects, but even those wouldn't warrant a second viewing. Yawn!"
4,Worth the Purchase,"I'm a traditionalist and a purist so I liked the original better. But this movie is worth the purchase and the viewing time. I expected a rehash of the ""Poseidon Adventure"", but while the premise is the same, this is a different adventure story. So as far as remakes goes, this is quite original, entertaining and will keep you on the edge of your seat!"
3,Tough To Make remakes,Overall it was not a bad movie but after seeing the original hundreds of times it is tough to live up to.
4,Better than I expected,"After growing up with the original by Irwin Allen, and then seeing Titanic, I was pleasantly surprised. The action sequences are great, and there is enough storyline to keep you interested. At least no characters were repeated and although you keep hoping that everyone survives, it would not be a disaster movie without death to the lesser characters. You don't even realized the CG. I do recommend watching the how it was filmed section-Irwin Allen would be proud of the live water and fire used on the film sets."
3,remake,thought that the acting was good. I was not that impressed with the special affects. It looked like a virtual reality setup. Lacked authenticity. Preferred the original one. Special affects were great for that time. Looked more real!
3,A Worthy Remake,"Wolfgang Peterson has finally returned to his claustrophobic, watery roots with a remake of The Poseidon Adventure. Carnage abounds after a rogue wave upends the vessel, and passengers are variously drowned, crushed, fall, burned, and electrocuted. The cast is a good mix of veterans and newcomers like any good football team, with Kurt Russel at the helm, taking the likes of Josh Lucas and Jacinda Barret under his wing. This is a great example of the disaster genre, with plenty of good-looking CGI and big-bang pyrotechnics. Also, Kurt Russel pulls off the best piece of acting in his long career, a particularly good drowning."
3,It's okay,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. It's shorter than Das Boot, but to me doesn't meet up to Red October. Left me blah."
1,Poseidon,"This might be the worst movie I ever saw. In fact, I didn't even get through the first 30 minutes as the acting was so horrible.Holy Moly, no where near the original."
1,Dreadful,"Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory.I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it."
1,A bad remake.,"This movie kind of proves that you can't improve on the classics. I feel so bad, as to how bad, that i don't want to say any more bad things about this film. It's just poor. Get the original and rent it. Check out the actors of yesterday against these want-to-be's."
1,The Poseidon Conjecture,"It is difficult to believe that such copious amounts of money and state-of-the-art technology could produce a film even more boring and flatulent than the original. Somehow Wolfgang Petersen has managed. This movie isn't just incompentently directed, poorly acted, and deadly dull. It is badly written, stupid, and ridiculous. Rent this CD, place it in your microwave, set the timer at 5 minutes, and get drunk in joyous celebration. You will have rid the world of a minor evil and expunged 98 minutes of unmitigated crap."
1,Horrible,"I will never understand why Hollywood decides to re-make classic movies, only for them to fail miserably in the box office, and then flop again when released on DVD.What I will never understand even more, is when Hollywood remakes a movie that was horrible THE FIRST TIME, and then they make it even worse the second time around.If you are having trouble sleeping, get this movie."
2,POSEIDON 2006,"Given that diesel generators do not normally produce electricity while suspended upside down, where did the lighting come from? Pretty ordinary compared to the original where special effects were virtually non-existant."
3,Very nice in every aspect except comfort,Very hard and little cushioning in the inner shoe / sole makes this one hurt. Otherwise very nice.Have owned two pairs.
3,Good but not great,This was my first Catherine Anderson novel and I did enjoy this book I did feel slightly let down. The characters were good and the story well told but I felt that not only could this book have done with an Epilogue. I was disappointed that nothing happened to the rapist. We are told that Caitlin was a strong women but this does not really come across because she never really displays any anger to her father or her attacker. Is this due to some inherent sexism or are women in fiction just not allowed to display any negative emotion or just want vengence for themselves and the things they have suffered.
2,Not her best work,"I love C. Anderson's books. She has a way of grabbing you, and making you feel for the main characters. This one, unfortunately, didn;t do as well as her other ones. It was slow paced, and kind of dull. It had a lot of potential to be a great book, but I lost interest. The ending was lousy."
3,Enjoyable Novel/Poor Character Development,"This was an enjoyable novel that had the potential to be an excellent novel. I would have given it a higher score if the author have focused more attention on developing the relationship between the lead characters rather than focus on the external plot. Instead the characters simply fell in love with each other after being forced to marry. Since the heroine was fairly awful to the hero, I never understood the reason for the love. A romance novel should be a journey in which two people grow to love each other. The external plot is important but should never overshadow the journey. Instead it should be part of the journey. This books focuses too much on the external plot."
4,Very Good Book,"Death, rape, forced marriage, fighting, shooting etc... was the backdrop for this book. None of these were extremely descriptive. For those of you that are into more upbeat romance novels you want to consider passing on thisThe story was however well written, strong characters and your typical happy ending. If you take the chance I hope you enjoy it."
2,Okay,"I tried to like this book, but didn't have much luck. It is hard to follow, and the characters are confusing. I don't recommend it."
2,Boring to me,I have read the books in order and liked them all. However this one I did not like. I couldn't find enough plot. Too much filler with Sicely etc. I skimmed much of the book.
2,Not For Me,"This is the second time I did not enjoy a book partially because I do not like aspects of Italian culture. It doesn't interest me at all. The story (about the mafia, Sicily, getting even...) was not sufficiently compelling to compensate. The writing got a bit wonky here and there, to the point that at times I found my attention drifting through meandering verbiage. It wasn't for me. Not terribly imaginative."
5,Gritty and beguiling,"This is Dibdin at his best - Aurelio Zen continues his litany of faults, idiosyncracies and insights into the most dangerous and beguiling scenario of his career. Caught between feelings for his almost daughter, Carla, and his need to solve the crime, Zen is drawn further into a truly perfect web. The end is traumatic and yet absolutely perfect -- you just have to read your way here."
5,GREAT,Bought this item for my grandsons who love anything Batman. They enjoy watching this with anyone who will watch it with them.
1,Love it!,The DVD as a gift for my great-grandson and he loves it!Anything to keep the little ones happy! thank you!
3,The new Adventures of Batman,Being a huge batman fan and not seeing this DVD before I ordered it just to see what is was like.It is totally different to any other Batman movie or episode that I have seen. It was great that Adam West and Burt Ward did the voice overs but the animated Batmite character I could really do without.For a Batman fan it is a must have DVD just to add to the collection. The plots and crimes are great.
3,I don't like bat-mite,"If you haven't seen this show, brace yourself for bat-mite. It's kind of like a clumsier, more annoying version of the Great Gazoo from the Flintstones. I don't know what's he is doing there, but I don't like it. Other than that the show is pretty good. The animation isn't the greatest, but that's what all TV animation was like at that time. It's cool that Adam West does the voice of Batman."
2,This is not a good cartoon,"Filmation did really,really good with he-man,but this cartoon was something else entirely.Adam West and Burt Ward did great but the storyline and a green bat mite were something else. Now after seeing this i can understand why Bob Kane did not say anything when he was at filmation,this is just not a bood Batman cartoon. I dont understand why the first filmation Batman isnt out on dvd yet,it was alot better."
1,"Much Respect, But I Can't Bear This...","A whole lot of 60's Batman fans are gonna hate me for this one, but I'm sorry...while I couldn't get enough of the hokey Batman & Robin fashion of the 60's as a little kid, I grew to love the original Dark Knight persona of Batman from the 80's to the present, no exceptions. This collection is good for historical value but not for nutritional. Felt like I was watching Suiperfriends with only Batman & Robin. BOOOOOOO!"
3,SunBurn,"This book is about these teenagers going down to a summer home. They went down for a vacation. Then when they get down there everything starts to go wrong. The house starts going insane. The lights go on and off, the AC is smelling, ect... The main characters are Claudia Walker, Joy, Marla, Alfred, and Daniel. Claudia was the one that got the summer home. She's in charge of everything. And Joy, Marla, Alfred, and Daniel are her friends that went along with her. I could relate to Claudia because she's the most active one. She's the oldest out of all her friends, and she is always the leader.The book was ok, it kept me reading. My least favorite part was when Claudia was on the beach and she almost got eaten by a shark and the dog. My favorite part of the book was the ending you would have never suspected who it was.I would recommend his book to people who like reading horror books and suspense stories. If you like horror books I would really recommend this book."
4,Tina's Reveiw,"I enjoyed this book and I think its because I've read so manybooks of his. I have been reading R.L. Stine books for a longtime, ever since 4th grade and I am now in 7th.I liked the book because it had a surprising ending. I'mreally good at solving the problems and guessing what thebook is about, but this time I had no clue. There is a lot ofpainful experiences and injuries in this book. Someone diesat the end and you won't guess who. (It's tricky)I think that everyone can read this book. It's at an averagereading level. Just about any age will understand it."
5,This book is sizzilin hottt!!,"Marla invited her friends down to her beach house for a little visit.But marla did not know that soon she would have horror in her life along with murder.Marla was killed,and her friends were brought to her beach house to be tourchered by a specific person.Marla dint know that either of her friends would be facing horrific stunts.This was a excellent book.."
2,Its possible to over-remaster,This is a great collection of Leadbelly songs. It had a few I hadn't heard before. However whomever remasterd this disc went a little overboard. Reverb is added to most of the tracks. At times way to much. Some of the tracks also clip a little when lead gets real loud. Though not much. I wouldn't recommend this album for the purists. Only the obssesive collector.
2,"Some good information, not well organized","I purchased this book because I wanted to train for my first half marathon. After reading all the glowing recommendations above I was sure to receive just what I needed. Although I found some great tips on cross-training and how to increase my speed, I didn't find enough specifics on precisely how to create the right training program for me as I did in several other books. The author's writing style is awkward. Narrative sentences are almost non-existent. Instead, most sentences are short commands making the text read like a Dr. Bronner's bottle. This is an author-published book and the formatting is awful! Body text is huge and headings are sometimes underlined and sometimes italicized (and sometimes not). Spelling and grammar are atrocious making reading a scavenger hunt. Overall a thumbs down."
1,waste of time,"This was stupid. Even though I knew some of the people in it, it was still a waste of time."
1,Very lame,"I was very disappointed with this movie. The summary of the movie on the cover indicates David Caruso as the main star, his picture is on the front. Except he is only in the movie for about a minute. The movie is supposed to be a comedy. There may be one scene that is humorous, but for the most part it's a drama and a very poor one. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time with this movie."
5,A Great Book - Successful in My Classroom!,I am excited to let everyone know that this wonderful little book proved to be a hit in my classroom! I teach 3rd Grade and my students had an absolute ball performing these monologues! They are brief in length and the scenarios are very life-like and easy for the children to relate to. Give your classroom a gift and pick up this little treasure!
3,Not good for auditions,"I was hoping this would be a good resource for audition material for my daughter, but most directors want actual monologues from published plays. These are all original pieces that would probably be better for use in a public speaking class or something along those lines. They are cute and interesting, though... just not the best for an open-call audition."
3,Just So-So,"I bought this book to use as a resource in a drama class that I teach. In my class I usually have students pick a monologue at the beginning of the year and then improve on their performance of it as we go, finally performing it at the annual recital. I was looking for some new material. This book is just okay. A few of the monologues are good, most are just so-so and none are really fantastic. My biggest problem with most of them is that there seems to be very little room for character building. Also, most of them are based on situations which are somewhat cliche. I was hoping for something with more depth and a bit more interesting. Not a total waste of money, but I probably could have found something better."
2,Not Compatible,"Great game, but don't expect to run it in Windows XP using Windows 95 compatiblity mode. After installation, when attempting to run the program, an error ""The MIDI driver for your sound card could not be found"" appears and the only option allowed is to exit the program. My MIDI drivers are working fine, and dxdiag reports no errors. I've tried three different MIDI emulators (Sound Blaster Audigy, Realtek, and Yamaha) and all of them result in the same message. And the documentation does not state anywhere that a MIDI device is even necessary. Apparently, others have the same problem as there are several web postings asking for help with the problem. Further, the web site listed for help and support no longer exists."
3,Childhood favorite,"I was so excited to get this game. It does not work on any of the 3 XP computers I have. They all say something about the midi driver. I was able to get my tech bro to get it to work on a small screen in DOS box. It is as good as I remember, in a very small box. I really wish it did work on XP though."
1,educational software,"I took a gamble in hopes that the program would run on my computer whiich has windows XP. It would not install completely, thus it did not run. My gamble, my loss!"
2,"Could we suck up to the ""Widow Kennealy"" any more?","This book is gorgeous. If you love the young, pouty lion-god, you will love the photos in this book. If you're interested in the rest of the Doors...look elsewhere. This book is largely a paraphrase of Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's _Strange Days_. Yeah, yeah, we already read that one."
2,Very disappointed,"I thought this title would prove ideal for me -- one with very little knowledge on the subject. Instead, I found the text long-winded, very repetitive, and filled with common-sense wisdom; e.g. ""remind your customers to always lock their doors"". I had hopes for detailed tips, do's/don't's, etc. for installation of security systems. However, I found mostly useless (to me) details on some internal workings of mechanisms and then countless, repeated anecdotes as similarly described. About the only value I believe I could obtain from this book is some troubleshooting tips. I now will have to spend more money on another book on the subject, *sigh*."
1,"Promises a lot, delivers almost nothing","The publisher's comments the back of the book promise the world. In reality it delivers virtually nothing. I hoped for a detailed discussion on the pros and cons of various sensor types, recomendations on designing and installing an alarm and suggestions as to how thieves by-pass alarms and ways in which this can be minimized through design.Instead the book delivered the most cursory description of sensors, devoting pages to magnetic reed switches and almost nothing to PIR's, which are probably the most common sensors used today. Most false alarms are caused by the incorrect placement of PIRs (facing them at drapes or heaters for instance) and this is not discussed. Instead the book's idea of fault finding is a few pages on tacing a broken wire.I should have taken more note of other reviews recommending against this book."
3,Josephine Baker lives once more for a new generation!,"The popular American-born, Parisian cabaret sensation Josephine Baker is celebrated here with 14 classic recordings made in the early 1930's.Josephine Baker is still regarded as one of the most talented and under-rated musical talents of the 20th century. She led a colorful life and was an active performer up until the time of her death.The tracks on this CD from budget label Goldies, include ""La Petite Tonkinoise"", ""You're the One I Care For"", ""My Fate is in Your Hands"", ""Ram-Pam-Pam"" and ""Les Mots d'Amour"".Most of the material that Baker performed was written especially for her, and the song ""Dis-Moi Josephine"", which she regularly performed in her act, became her trademark song.Collectors and fans alike will adore this CD from the legendary queen of the Parisian night-life...Josephine Baker!"
1,Boring and tepid,"This 60-minute documentary was, to be frank, extremely dull. The filmmakers had an opportunity here to get some intelligent, in-depth conversations about the subject matter, but instead, it was an hour of tepid conversation and frequently-espoused cliches. Steer clear."
5,Great information for getting on top of the search engines,"I bought a few books like this in the past, But this was the first one that presented the subject in a way that was understandable and in an easy-to-implement way. My web site has gone from unfindable to right at the top of many searches. I highly recommend this book for beginner and advanced alike."
4,Useful reference for new webmasters,"This book contains many useful tips for new webmasters - how to submit keywords to various search engines so as to be high on the hit list, how to work with affiliates, becoming an affiliate, and so on.Glad that I've bought it."
5,Million Dollar Advice,"I can inform you that I am very satisfied with Webmaster'sSecrets. ...straightforward advice presented in this book. Themarketing effect was absolutely spectacular!. .... Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you YOU...GENIUSES!"
4,Already A Believer.,"Part history of the city of Chicago Part history of the Cubs. Part overview of the 2008 season. All in all a very good film ......for Cubs fans. I don't think it will mean much to the uninitiated hence limiting the audience. However that being said, it was a good shot in the arm for the off season. Go Cubs Go!"
1,Very disappointed,"Not what I expected. The pages look old and yellowed and not very interesting. I ordered a hard cover book and received, instead, a soft cover book with a bent cover and pages. For this I paid $150.00 plus shipping."
4,review,"not really much to it, but the girl enjoyed it - the game only gets really hard at the end. in any case, better for her than tv."
5,Good collection of parts,I have used about eight of these. They are easier to use than buying the individual parts. The parts are top grade.
3,Not well made but kids will like watching it.,This isn't a toy but my grandsons (age 3 and 6) love to turn it on and watch the snow falling and hear the music. Not something that will last long if it's treated too rough. I still don't regret buying it for the price I paid.
3,santa globe,"it is a nice christmas decoration for the price as it lights up and plays music, i think my kids will get a kick out of it."
4,A good read!,"Melanie Wells' book cover for When the Day of Evil Comes promises suspense, and this page turner delivers what it promises. Free-spirited psychology professor Dr. Dylan Foster forces herself to attend a faculty picnic in Austin, Texas. There she comes face-to-face with demon, Peter Terry, and her life literally becomes a living hell.It begins when the wedding ring her mother was buried with shows up without explanation. Add to that the stench of rotten eggs and hoards of black flies infiltrating Foster's immaculate home. Now you've got the beginning of a spiritual battle that takes Foster from Texas to Chicago and back as she fights to regain her professional reputation, her personal life, and her sanity. This nail-biter will keep you awake as you wonder how much more Foster can survive.Armchair Interviews says: If you've ever wondered, ""Why me?"" when something went wrong, you'll want to read this book to discover answers, Powerful Answers from above."
1,Evil-Schmeevil,"Sorry, but I don't see what the big deal is. The Peter Terry character is about as scary-looking as the kid from the movie ""POWDER"", and barely makes his presence felt in these books. He's talked about, referred to, and fretted over, but that's about it. He shows up now and again, but why? Just to set the protagonist, Dylan Foster, on the trail of another whodunit? How dismally convenient is that?This is a Rated-G horror story -- perfect for a middle-aged Nancy Drew comeback."
3,Great Start...Fizzles at the End,"I was prompted to try this book when buying a Ted Dekker novel. Thought I'd give it a try as it was a highly recommended Christian thriller. I read the book while traveling and admit I enjoyed it. But it didn't bring a strong, climactic conclusion that the early chapters warranted. For the first quarter-to-half of the book, you really can't put it down. It's creepy good. But as the author weaves the characters, story, and plot lines together, the big ""wow, I didn't see that coming"" wasn't there. The characters just kind of went on with their lives once the secret was revealed. I gave it three stars because the launch of the book is exceptional; the story holds it own; it's an easy, quick read; and the Christian themes are prevalent throughout. Overall a good book and I'll probably find myself reading the second in the series just to see where it goes..."
3,Bra,"I'm sure this is a good product for some, but it didn't fit me. I guess I had the wrong size. I sent it back."
2,Didn't hold up like i thought,"Didn't hold up like i thought ,and don't fit Narrow at the bottom ,although it appears that support excellent but it is not."
2,WILL NOT HELP YOUR POSTURE!!!,"This bra will not help your posture. I tried three different sizes and they did not fit. All were returned to Amazon. Playtex should be required to take ""posture bra"" out of the name of this product, because it's false advertising."
2,Playtex 18 hour,Didn't hold up like i thought it would lost its shape afer only two hand washings will not buy this product again
1,fake,"I've been buying these bras for years. This bra looked nothing like a playtex posture bra. It was a cheap imitation, even the box looked fake. Tried to wear it one time but it was so uncomfortable had to throw it away. Would never trust this seller again. This is the first negative review i have written concerning a product I bought through amazon."
5,Great bra,This is a very comfortable bra. It really helps when working to keep your back from hurting. I really like that it is a front closure.
4,Playtex Women's 18-Hr Posture Bra,"As is usually true with a Playtex 18-hr bra, this bra is comfortable, true to size, uplifting, and cool. Honestly, I didn't notice any posture difference but then perhaps my posture is o.k. to begin with. The shoulder straps are wide enough that they don't cut into my shoulders. The shoulder strap adjustments are hooks rather than the sliding type adjustments - they stay adjusted. I would buy another bra like this one and I would recommend this bra to my friends and relatives."
4,An Interesting Look into a Military Mind,"You have to be determined to finish this book. It starts slow, and the writing isn't the best, but it provides an interesting glimpse into the mind of Tommy Franks and the military during the Iraqi and Afghani invasions. I enjoyed it, and it's a great read for anyone interesting in the strategy behind our two latest wars."
1,Won't stand the test of time,"I liked this book when I first read it. But having just finished Sean Naylor's ""Not A Good Day to Die,"" that General Franks and others tried to obstruct because it lays bare the tragedy of Operation Anaconda, I'm inclinded to take ""American Soldier"" in the back yard and burn it."
4,Good Behind the Scenes View,"Overall, I really enjoyed General Franks' book. I was intimidated by it's large size, but I found the reading intriguing and pages flying by faster than I thought they would. I was thoroughly engaged by this book.The first part of the book gives us Franks' background. Franks pulls no punches and shares the good and the bad. It is in the events and people of his early life that the Franks we know today was formed.In the second part of the book, dedicated to Franks' military career, we can see the evolution of the American military and the conflict between the old guard generals and Franks' new way of doing business. Franks pulls no punches here, either. Franks opens our eyes to the realities of war in the 21st century.The main reason to read this book is not Franks, however. American Soldier provides a behind the scenes glimpse of the strategy, planning and tough decisions that are required for security in today's world."
5,A wonderful career...,"General Franks story is inpirational. He writes about growing up in Texas, joining the Army, becoming an officer and going to Vietnam but more importantly he puts those events in context. He tells us how these events led to the person who would be General Franks, CG of CENTCOM. Whether the reader just wants to know the makings of a fine American or is curious about the man who led Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, this is the book for you."
4,GREAT BOOK/TONS OF BEHIND THE SCENES INFO,"I have read numerous Vietnam books detailing first-hand accounts of Navy SEALS operations, but the Vietnam chapter in Tommy Franks' book is far and away the best re-creation of specific events of that war to date. It was also a great read learning about his upbringing and the events that shaped him into the man he is today. What a revelation it was for me to find out he was adopted. The later chapters go into some very detailed information regarding the behind the scenes maneuvering that emerged into what we know now as the ""Shock and Awe Campaign"". If you like wars, history, politics or just a plain old great autobiography, you will not be disappointed. You might even be thinking what I am right now -- Why isn't THIS man runnning for President of the United States? USA!!!"
5,American Soldier,"A fantastic book, it reinforces the fact that the war in Iraq was justified. Very well written and made me proud to be an American. I plan to buy a copy for our son, who has fought in all 3 wars as a United States Marine. This would be excellent reading for all students in high school. Great history book."
1,Utter Disappointment,"If one has read Norman Schwarzkopf's book, or Colin Powell's, this one is a complete disappointment!Mr. Franks never reflects on anything: Instead of discussing whether it was right or wrong to be in Vietnam, he describes how to build effective ""bombs"" from handgranades to be dropped on the Viet Cong.The torture incidents alledgedly commited by US soldiers is worth to him one line in a book of over 550 pages.He is completely non-critical of President Bush and of ""SecDef"" Don Rumsfeld, both of whom seem unfaillable to him.I was hoping for some critical insights into Afganistan & Iray, instead, all one gets is how great and wonderful everybody (except the enemy, of course) is; and of course one learns the Army Language, which seems to consist mostly of acronyms and the f - word.The book is not bad, it is worse: A waste of time!"
1,Incompetent,Franks is an incompetent political hack. He parrots the Bush line with total disregard for the lives and welfare of his troops. How is it that he was so short sighted to think they could start pulling troops out of Iraq right after the invasion? How is it that he was able to retire when his men are all on stop loss? Then when his mean are dying in Iraq he travels around during the Bush campaign promoting another incompetent hack like himself. This is the kind of General the Bush administration likes. Say what we want you to say and think of yourself first just like we do.
3,General Franks Needs to Be More Candid,"This is actually better than average for the genre. It is well written and the story is inspriring in many ways. But there is a big hole. General Franks was given 150,000 troops and years to execute one mission: get the man who killed 3000 Americans __ a 6'6"" Arab on dialysis. He failed. Only results matter but Franks does not for me anyway explain why he failed in the most important mission of his life."
4,Great......Powerful Book.........Tommy Franks is a true hero,"Tommy Franks is the embodiment of what every soldier shouldhope to stand for. He's tough, courageous, intelligent,honorable and inspirational. This book reveals the manwithin, powerful, it may even give those who have been againstthe War in Iraq and Afghanistan since day one, a little moreinsight, even if you don't like reading about the military,read this book, just for the way it reveals the soul of a man,a man who has done almost more than anyone else to help freeAfghanistan and Iraq from the oppression and terror that theysuffered."
1,Page 280 is the page I stopped reading,"I had high respect for General Frank, till I reached page 280. In that page he claimed not to have a better leader than George Bush in his 36 year professional service. He does not address any of the question as to why we do not have Osama or Mullah Omar and why his strategies were a total failure in Afganistan as well as in Iraq. He does not address the issue if the Iraq war undermined the war on terror by diverting scare rescources. He also does not address any issue how the mead east peace is going to be achived and how this military invasion is going to bring democracy in the region.There are times when he criticized Richard Clark who authored the new book on Against all Enemy of not prividng with actionable intelligence to attach bin Laden. But alas can not provide how a policy maker will get intelligence when it is job of CIA.He seems to me an arrogant Texan just like Bush who has very skewed and polarized view of the world."
2,I can not recommend this book,"Good Soldier, but not a good book. Outstanding performance in OEF and OIF, but this book is too long and too boring. Regretfully, I can not recommend this book to any of my active duty or retired military friends."
2,This is a Pakistani zarb,"The skin is too loose and does not have a good sound. I returned it and it got damaged in transit and I wound up paying for it anyway. I am now looking for a tunable zarb from Iran. Generally you have to know private dealers who go over there and bring over small quantities. But those are the good ones. It was easy to deal with customer service, though. They were very responsive."
5,Comfy,Very comfy sandal that has a smaller heel than I am used to but it still looks nice and I've used it for company events
3,Blisters and redness,Sandal fits the soles of my feet nicely. But a little tight in the front. Had blisters and redness too. Not recommended for people with wide feet like mine.
5,It's good !,A nice CD to have. If you like electric guitar virtuosos then you will love Rob Balducci. Add this to your music collection.AP
3,good but too complicated,this book is good if you already know some mec or elec stuff...otherwise it is too complicated. answers with no explaination....
3,No directions....,"This craft product seemed right up my daughter's alley. Not sure if it was just the one that I purchased, but there were no directions, other than some small writing on the front saying, in essence, fold the paper and attach the pipe cleaner. The flowers on the cover of the box looked amazing but we can't replicate any of them on our own. So, if you somehow know how to make the flowers, then it's great. Otherwise, if you don't have the directions, it makes it tough. Plus, there is no box to store everything in (a pet peeve of mine)."
2,would be nice if the tissue papers were nice quality,"My daughter and I love to make crafts together. The idea of this toy is quite lovely and the flowers do look nice if you can manage to avoid tearing the papers. The big problem is that the tissue papers included are so cheap, they rip apart too easily. This is frustrating for children and adults. For the price, they could give us nice quality paper and then it would be a great toy. I will just make my own now with some Hallmark tissue"
5,CUTE!!!,I got this after watching the video on how to make these flowers. I figured that I would give it a try and see if my kids would like it. I love that it makes them learn to follow directions and then when we are done.... we have some pretty flowers to play with. Cute.
2,Cheap but Clog,"These gates clog often for me. Since the blast door is contained, chips get jammed into the slot and they keep the door from closing completely. Since these doors cannot be disassembled, they are difficult to clean."
1,Beware,"The trouble with the design of this blast gate is there is no way to clean out any accumulated dust. Even with the best dust collector, you will always get some stray dust or debris that accumulates on the gate. Every time you open and close the gate, this dust get packed into the bottom of the gate. Eventually, the gate will not close all the way. As more dust gets trapped, the less the gate can close. I didn't observe this until about a year after using them. I will have to replace all these gates with the metal version which has cut corners that will not allow any dust to get trapped. With the metal version, any dust or debris gets pushed out of the corners when the gate is closed.Conclusion...dont waste your money on these!"
3,So So,"Bought several of these at the same time, wish i hadnt. They are ok for the money but gate slot jams with sawdust very fast nesitating having to unhook hose or tube to clean or else you cant shut the gate. also have had 2 of them come apart (bad glue job??)"
1,Very poor blast gates,"These are junk. I bought 7 of these blast gates and while installing them, four of them came apart. I was not rough with them. Bad glue job or maybe poor glue, but in order to use them, I drilled all four corners and bolted them together. Now I find out they clog very quickly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY for these blast gates."
5,Part,"Replacement part for a vacuum, my husband can fix anything. It's nice to find the parts we need. Thank you."
4,A blast,"A blast to use open the gate air goes through close the gate and it doesn't. It could be slightly tighter so the door stays fully open in the upright position, Lay it on its side and it works better."
4,Practable,"I purchased four of the gates to use on my collection system. They are very easy to use and install. The only thing that I wish that they had was a stop built into them to keep them open when in use in the vertical position. I had purchased a competitor's gate to finish the system that had this stop in them and it really helps to be able to mount the gate vertically and not horizontally to help keep it open. All in all, it is a great item and recommend it's use to anyone."
5,Be an Angel: A must-read and a welcome breath of delight!,"Be an Angel is a work of art that speaks to all of us craving a break or breath of joy. The playfulness and magical writing/illustration combination make this book a treasure. It's great to pick up before a trip or before work---get to know each angel's name and take them with you! Each angel has a personality and spirit that calls you into the pages. ""Winsum"" and ""Abide"", to name a couple, are angels of nature and of the home. Each angel is not only a gift and a surprise, but each comes with helpful hints on how we can be angels in everyday life. My personal favorites are ""Wander""--Angel of Travel and ""Bloom""--Angel of the Garden. There are angels for mothers, children, and everyone. If only everyone could embrace the message in this delightful book and act on it, the world would be more angelic! A must-read---buy 4 or 5 for friends--this is a perfect book for new moms, graduation gifts, birthday gifts, or tokens of friendship."
3,"Too Small of a ""Best Of"" CD for the Asking Price","The songs on this CD are good, but there are so many essential Incredible String Band tunes left out that it is hard to call this ""The Best Of."" The price tag, in my opinion, is a tad steep considering how many songs were absent.If you want to get the best String Band for your buck, I highly recommend buying some of the double-album sets available. The finest are ""The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion/The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" and ""Be Glad for the Song Has No Ending/Liquid Acrobat As Regards the Air."" Another album that is excellent on its own is ""U.""Way too many songs are left out of the mix on this CD. Most noticeably absent are""The Minotaur's Song,"" ""Three Is a Green Crown,"" ""The Hedgehog Song,"" ""Blackjack Davy,"" ""Mercy I Cry City"" and ""Pictures In a Mirror."" The songs on this CD are good, but barely scratch the surface."
2,"Misleading CD title, poor quality sound","I was expecting to hear Sydney Bechet AND Art playing together, I was wondering how they could sound, but to my surprise this is a CD put together with some poor quality recordings of an Art Tatum trio and in order to fill the space and probably make it more attractive they added some Sidney tunes ( better sound quality). So...a forgettable CD, not worth buying it. If you are a Tatum fan you may have his solo and group masterpieces, excellent CDs, There are a lot of better Sidney CDs as well."
2,"Good as a high school report, substandard as a biography","This is not the book for you if you want to learn about the Pope. The author has interviewed no one for his primary materials - neither Benedict XVI nor anyone who knows him. Instead he relies on recent materials written by others. Since this leaves insufficent material to print and bind a book, he fills the pages with biographical material of our previous pope.This leaves unanswered the question ""Who is Benedict XVI?""."
5,Pulls you into Yourself!,Cait Johnson is a gifted writer and has the ability to reach down into your soul and help you start a transformation within. This is a wonderful book to read on a quiet day when you are ready to soak up all the wisdom she offers. You may find yourself feeling you've moved up to a higher dimension as your mind 'walks' through this lovely book. It is one to drift back to time and again.
1,Quick Disconnect ... Always Disconnected,"True adapter quickly connects to hose and is air tight, but ... disconnects (while in use) from tool (table saw, jointer, planer, etc.)"
2,Disconnect too easily,"These don't work properly for me. After much frustration, I bought a system that has a positive locking mechanism (""FazLok"" quick disconnect fittings available from Wordworker's Supply). The FazLock connectors work just fine with the PSI 4"" hose."
1,It is a Quick Disconnect,"I don't know why I bought this, even after reading the other reviews. The logic of the quick disconnect to move from machine to machine seemed cost justified. However, the product will disconnect while in use, and even disconnect if not perfectly flat.Rather than use this product, avoid, avoid, avoid. Set your dust collection system up with ""Y"" or ""T"" fittings to each machine with blast gates to control the air flow. This hard wired system, even though it cost more, will be much better system to operate and use without hassles."
2,"Mediocre, but has a some redeeming qualitites","This book does have SOME nice pictures, but the bottom line: there is an unacceptable amount of room for improvement. The authors of this book had great potential to create something extraordianry, but wasted space by including too much text for a coffee table book and devoting entire pages to average photographs. Despite its many flaws, I do have to admit that their selections were truly fresh and original. The authors use several palaces that I had never heard of and avoid using cliches like Versailles, Schonbrun, or the Catherine Palace. If you are looking for a different lineup of palaces you might want to give this book a second thought. If you do decide to but it, DO NOT, under any circumstances, pay retail for this book. I found a used one at $28.00, and I experienced some buyer's remorse."
1,Cindina,I didn't like this CD at all. I didn't learn a thing and would not purchase any of her CD ever again.
2,Don't bother,"I am a Heather Headley fan, or atleast I used to be. This CD is terrible!!! How many slow, sad songs can you sing on an album?? This CD pales in comparison to the first one. That was a good album, this is not. Also, whats up with that strange twang-like sound in her voice on In My Mind?? She's not from Texas, so why is she singing with a twang on that single?? I'm not feeling this single or album!"
2,Uhm...Okaaay,"I'm having a really difficult time with the subsequent reviews. If Heather's latest supercedes her debut, then it's a good thing I never purchased it. No disrespect to the talents and abilities of this woman, but I expected MUCH MORE. Upon hearing the breathtaking first single, ""In My Mind"", and viewing an outstanding live performance on Jay Leno, I HIGHLY anticipated this release. Unfortunately, it didn't come CLOSE to what I had hoped. Most of the production is quite mediocre and uninspiring, to say the least. With the exception of ""In My Mind"" (which dominates the album, solely), ""Am I Worth It"", ""Back When It Was"" ""What's Not Being Said"" and ""Me Time"", there's NOT MUCH, here. Honestly, it would do Heather good to implement her creative autonomy into future projects, because quite frankly, I truly believe that than (and, only then) will we experience the full depth of this artistic vessel."
1,gifted jesus loving singer creates bland album,"There's no doubt that Heather H. has an amazing amount of talent. Unfortunately, her follow up album to her sleeper hit and grammy nominated debut album does nothing to showcase that. Aside from a much improved album cover, the songs are entirely forgettable and excrutiatingly bland. This is only emphasized when compared to her first album which offered well written tightly produced ditties that resonated on so many levels. The single In My Mind is quite good, but even better performed live. The only other song of remote interest is the gospel tinged last track, Change. Speaking of change, she might consider changing producers, songwriters, and possibly agent. Also, the whole ""thank you Jesus"" footnotes is yawn inspiring.Quickly getting over Heather."
4,Newfound Treasure,"I was totally oblivious to Heather's talent until going to launch.com and seeing her video premiere for ""In My Mind"". I was completely blown away. Then, I raced to get the cd the following day and I haven't stopped listening yet. Heather's voice is incredible and fulfills the yearning for real music when you really need it. My favorites are: ""I Didn't Mean To"", ""Letter"", ""Losing You"", ""Me Time"", ""Am I Worth It?"" and of course the title track ""In My Mind""!!!"
2,"She can Sing/Sang,but gets generic material","when i heard this Album I expected more.Heather Headley can sing/Sang,but this Material here is kinda corny. this Album got Her sounding like a Lounge Oleta Adams. it's missing that snap&that One track that truly highlights her fully to me. I enjoyed hearing her vocal range,but not the dime a dozen music that kicks in for the most part of this album.there are Artists on Labels that are tax write offs,but Heather Headley ain't one of them,She deserves better."
3,A great voice in search of great music!,"First, I accidently ran across this CD when picking up another. I heard absolutely nothing about a new release from this artist in press. So, Clive and the gang need to get a better publicist for this artist. Second, the CD is mediocre at best. ""In my mind"" is good ""wait a minute""-has potential to chart and ""the letter"" is a good breakup song--and that's it. Three years and this is the best out there? C'mon, Heather. I've been following your career since I saw you in AIDA. You have the voice, now you need to get with the hot songwriters...or go back to Broadway."
5,Absolutely Incredible!!!!!!,"The minute I heard ""In My Mind"" I thought it was incredible.Heather Headley's album is absolutely perfect.I mean it has to be one of the best cd's I have heard in a long time.Her voice is so pure and clear.I love every song on her cd.I totally recommend this to anyone who loves good music.Trust me you won't be sorry!"
4,Welcome back Heather !!,"The R and B music scene today is sorely lacking in singers of substance these days, they are mostly cookie cutter singers who all sound alike. Heather breaks away from the rest of the pack and stands out as a first class singer. her broadway skills are very apparent on her albums and that is a good thing. If you appreciate good, mature and smart lyrics you will love this CD."
4,WOW!,"okay, i love, love, love this woman! this cd was very timely for me on so many levels. it's as if she knew! some may think that there is a bit of male bashing in there, but you know what? they could use a little from time to time! at first i thought of ""in my mind"" as a stalker's anthem, but that was before i had ""the experience"" myself. and i am by no means a stalker, but i understand where she's coming from. this cd is great fun, it's sexy, it's real! if you haven't done so already-- go get it... what are you waiting for???"
4,Great CD,A lot of folks are saying it's better than the first. I'm not sure that it is better but it is indeed differnt. All in all Ms. Headley is quite talented and has a great voice. I am very happy with the purchase.
3,Good Sophmore CD,"It seemed like a forever wait for this new CD from her previous one. I loved This Is Who I am. Heather was born to sing. She has a GREAT voice with a lot of range and a lot of distinction to it.Most of her music is mid-tempo/ballads. Her voice just shines on each and every one of them. I would have given it 5 stars for her voice alone but, the only problem is that sometimes you get lost in the songs. The songs are good, don't get me wrong, they just seem to all have the same melody and theme to them and tend to sort of blend together. There is not too many that standout due to having the same sound throughout.It is a good CD. She has a brilliant/powerhouse of a voice. I just think that the sound could use a little bit of work to ""spruce"" it up a bit."
3,"Where's the ""Voice"" ??","After seeing Heather on Broadway in Aida, I knew I would buy any CD she'd might make. The title track showcases her powerhouse of a voice, but it goes downhill from there. Why do good singers feel the need to ""collabo"" with other artists? Just ""sang"" girl, ""sang"", that's all we need."
3,You'll Find Release or Be Lost In Heather's Mind,"Lonely or broken-up from your man, then this is the album for you. Song after song is full of all the great ""you-done-me-wrong"" anthems that will surely make you get over your loved one quickly, with such songs as ""Wait a Minute"", ""Losing You"", and ""The Letter"". But yet, if you can't get over him that fast, there are a few tracks you can wallow in like ""I Didn't Mean To"" and ""What's Not Being Said"". And just when you thought Heather was going to leave you in a state of man hate/love limbo, she throws in ""How Many Ways"", ""Rain"", ""Back When It Was"" (which is a great groove, yet corny), and ""Change"" to try to take you away from where the last song left you. So, shed the baggage and thank Heather Headley for the release."
3,KAILA'S OPINION,"HEATHER HEALDEY HAS A SOULFUL, SULTRY VOICE THAT IS CLEAR AND REFRESHING. I CAN RELAX AND RELATE TO HER SONGS."
4,Great ride,Not many cd's are worth the investment. This one is! Heather is a great vocalist;wish more knew about her.
5,Sassy,Love this woman. She is a breath of fresh air. She can sing upbeat to slow and easy. She sings about reality and people. I can't say enough.Heather is the BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great Buy! Soulful voice,This album is worth every penny. Great production and lyrics. This artist is underrated...I hope to see her at the very top some day soon.
5,Comes into her own on this one,"Her first album ""This Is Who I Am"" was kind of in between the soul music she loved and the Broadway power ballads her fans were use to hearing her sing. ""In My Mind"" is a daring step in a different direction, with no Broadway-style power ballads like her solo debut. Executive producer Stephen Ferrea did a great job of mixing neo-soul and current R&B that works well with Heather's unique voice. At first I didn't know what to think of this album. Then I realized it was better than her first one. There were some filler's on her debut, wheras every song on here is listenable. I have to say the highlight is the ending song ""Change"" which is accompanied by a gospel chorus. If you enjoyed her first album but are willing to get something different, check out ""In My Mind""--the latest and best release from Heaher Headley."
3,A Good Effort but......,"I Love Heather Headley a lot but on this album, well something was definitely missing. Her vocal arrangements on some tracks were just too similar and in some parts a bit irritating. On the songs ""Wait A Minute"" & ""In My Mind"", when she was hitting her high register, it just got on my nerves.Her stand-out tracks for me are:- Change- What's Not Being Said.- Losing YouThe album is still in my car stereo and I like listening to it but I just wanted more from her. I still listen to ""This Is Who I Am"" and the sad thing is that I know her debut will still be on rotation in my collection while this one will fade.""Change"" is already on my Ipod with no chance of deletion."
2,I thought it was rather dull.,"I watched Basil with a friend. We found it easy to follow but with a very dull plot. The reason we chose this film was because of the wonderful actors and actress, and we LOVE English films. We were led to believe that Basil would sleep with someone before the end, but he never did! This is not the reason for the film's dullness but if Basil and Julia or Clara had sex, the movie would have been better. We did love the houses and clothes and accents but this movie does not rate high on our list."
2,The movie does not develop.,"I am a big fan of Claire Forlani, but this particular movie's plot fail. It doesn't develop the characters, so you don't feel anything for them."
2,Whole is Less Than the Sum of its Parts,"Basil has all the makings of a good movie... Sumptuous sets and scenery, period-piece romance and intrigue, attractive cast.But... nothing. Falls flat. NO chemistry between any of the three protagonists. No real cameraderie between Basil and John. NOTHING between John and Julia and (deadly problem) ZERO between Basil and Julia. It is difficult to feel for any of them at all. I cannot say what was missing here... maybe a tragic flaw or two to identify with...I love costume dramas and this one was just not up to snuff (like Dangerous Beauty). The film is a lot like Jared Leto... very beautiful but lacking any sort of magnetism."
3,Surprised,"I haven't read this Wilkie Collins story, but I found it intriguing and for the most part enjoyed it. The one problem I had was with Christian Slater. I am a big fan of Slater but this was a terrible miscast. Instead of a turn-of-the-century English man, he was obviously a modern American. Just didn't work - that surprised me.I think anyone who enjoys period-piece dramas will enjoy this film, though."
2,Basil - by Wilkie Collins - with Christian Slater,"Read the book, and don't bother with the movie. I could barely detect any of the book in this movie. Clare Forlani should have been his sister, Clara in the movie, but instead she was the temptress.In the book, she had a much more prominent role as Basil's sister/best friend, comforter, and Forlani was perfect for that - but not the role she played. Jared Leto is Basil and I liked him, while I did not like Christian Slater at all. I wasn't supposed to, as he's a villain, but then, I've never liked him. I repeat. Read the book. To add to my original review, the actor who played Basil is Jared Leto, not Greg Wise, as I mistakenly wrote. Further, the book is almost unrecognizable in this movie, but perhaps it will help you to enjoy the book more."
1,THIS REALLY STINKS,"This really really stinks because after about 1 month the L,R,Z, and left joystick don't work. It's not the batteries. I emailed them and said I did something to them. This basically sucks."
4,Wish I didn't need it,"Had to have this one for the Makita Planer, works fine, but I wish I didn't need it."
3,WOO,"Have not yet bought from this user yet so cant tell anyone if he/she is safe yet, but than again, this seems like a very good deal here, the best price ive seen for mighty max yet?. if your worth buying from consider me bought lol. hopefully its worth buying."
3,Reasonably good text content with less details in the CD-ROM,General coverage of all RP trends is good. Content in the CD-ROM is only informative. A Detailed coverage in CD-ROM would have been more useful. More details could be given on the resins/materials used in the different processes.
4,"""Girl in the Mirror""","This is about the 5th Mary Alice Monroe book I've read since discovering her when I read ""The Four Seasons."" Her later books seem to have appealed to me more than the story in ""Girl in the Mirror,"" but I did get caught up in this story. It'll be a sad day when I read the last of her books!"
3,Not as good as the others!,I have read most of Alice Monroe's books and this one is not as all-around good as the others. I believe it is one of her earlier ones!!!
4,Book review,Good book and integration of the main characters was well written and the book was a fast read for me
4,Girl in the Mirror,Very good read. The world of plastic surgery was finally portrayed as flawed. Makes you think about what you want in life has to be real. The characters were very vivid and believable.
4,Great conditioner for redheads!,I recently started dying my hair more red and my stylist suggested that I get this conditioner as well as the aveda madder root shampoo to help the red stay as long as possible since it's the quickest color to fade. I highly recommend it for someone looking to bring out more red in their hair or for someone with dyed red hair.
5,So Happy!,"I bought this on recommendation from my hair stylist. I use this once my hair starts fading in colour, which is about a week or two before my next appointment. The product really boosts the colour of my hair and adds shine. On that note my stylist said to be careful as the colour may penetrate into the grey roots if you are not careful."
3,"Doesn't condition, DOES color","This conditioner works very, very well for gently depositing major color, especially if your hair's already chemically treated. As a standalone conditioner, however, it doesn't do the job of smoothing or detangling very well. It's best to use it in addition to your regular conditioner."
5,Love this stuff - but watch for staining,"I purchased the Bumble and Bumble red product set, and the Aveda Madder Root product set (shampoo and conditioner) at the same time.I much prefer the Aveda products. This conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny, and gives it a nice color boost. Beware - the color can be slightly orange if not rinsed well, and it will stain, so be careful with it if you have porous bathroom surfaces/towels."
1,Chris Bartley,In my earlier years I enjoyed having this album in my collection. I have been replacing all my music with cd quality recordings. I was pleased to find the whole album as I enjoyed it all.
3,search over,"I am a oldie soul music collector, and I have been looking for the song ""For You"" for years. It was a bonus to find ""Sweetest Thing This Side of Heaven"" on the same CD. Outside of those 2 songs the CD is kinda dull. I received the package quickly."
4,Enjoyable and soothing,"It was a great CD but I think some of the lyrics were kind of girlie. They sometimes seem too sensitive but yet, sensitivity is good. I liked this CD but it could have had more of a variety of emotions."
3,Make sure you order the correct adapter,"This adapts a 4"" hose to a 2.5"" hose. It does not allow you to connect a 4"" hose to a common 2.5"" machine outlet. Woodcraft and Rockler have a 4"" to 2.25"" adapter which allows a direct connection."
2,Won't mount directly to tablesaw port but found solution,"I bought this hoping I could slide it onto the outside of my tablesaw dust port and attach my shop vac hose to it. Both the outside of this adapter and the outside of the tablesaw port are 4"". In other words it is a male to male connection. I could not find a female version.The solution I found was to get a 45 degree pvc plumbing joint for about $3. I could not find any other plumbing part that fit snugly, all the others were loose. The elbow holds the reducer snugly as well as the port from the tablesaw. I epoxied the adapter to the pvc elbow. You can then tape or glue the elbow to your tablesaw port as you desire for your purposes. This method worked a lot better than spending another $25 on a 4"" hose that I did not need.Here is a link to the part at home depot: [...]"
1,Useless adapter,"This item is recommended for purchase with the excellent DeWalt DW734 thickness planer, but it does not fit the DeWalt dust port. Fortunately, I also purchased the DustRight dust separator and either it or the planer (I don't remember which) came with the correct adapter."
1,Doesn't fit Jet JJP-8BT Jointer Planer,"Amazon has this listed with the page for the Jet JJP-8BT as ""People often buy this"". Don't spend the extra $5.00. One it doesn't fit onto the dust collector that is part of the Jet and second the Jet comes with a 4' to 2-1/2"" adapter already that does fit."
1,a wood worker little helper,"my dust collection main tubing is 4"" with a 5"" hose connecting the 4"" tube to the 6"" dust collector inlet through reducers i reviewed before but i did not want those big diameter hoses connected to my machines so i decided to buy many of these 4"" to 2-1/2"" reducers so i could use my machines more easily. a must."
2,Large end too small,"The dimensions given are not stated whether they are inside or outside, but I bought it anyway because it was not expensive. I found that the large end was the same as the fitting on my table saw so I have to fashion a sleeve to make it work. Having said that it fit my shop vac perfectly and it works fine."
1,Disappointed with Amazon,This is the first time I have been disappointed with ordering from Amazon. The product itself was as described but I odered a dust hood and some clamps with it and found out AFTER THE ORDER WAS PLACED that the clamps came from a different vendor and therefore the order was not eligible for free shipping and then that the dust hood (the reason for the order) would not be shipped for a month. I have no use for the reducer withhout the hood but it was shipped promptly and the hood was not. I cancelled the clamp order and the hood order but the cost of returning the reducer was more than the cost of the reducer itself. If the delay were made known at the time of the order I would not have placed it and would not be wary of any future orders.
3,Durably made,Durably made reducer.Also made according to specs for the woodworking dust collection hoses and such. The appropriate hoses fit accordingly without any coercion. Just use hose clamps or the woodworking hose clamps and you will be in business.Pleased with the quality of plastic in which it was made from.Chris
5,Thanks Amazon,"I accidentally ordered the wrong size adapter, but did not realize it until after it was shipped. I figure oh well it is only $5, write it off. Then I checked into how easy would it be to return it, being I never had to return anything back to Amazon before, I figured this would be a good trial run. But Amazon was having none of that, they told me to keep the part and they will refund my card anyway. Now thats is customer service.. Thanks Amazon for fixing my mistake for me, so easily."
4,works fine,"A little plastic adapter that does what it should. Buy it if you need it. Be aware the measurements are the outside diameter of the adapter, so you can't slip a 2-1/2 or 4"" OD fitting onto it."
3,Make sure it will fit,"I bought this when it came up as a suggestion by Amazon when I purchased a Grizzly jointer/planer. The 4"" diameter is the same as the outlet for the jointer/planer so it would not fit my application. I joined them with duct tape, but the 4"" hose sold by many retailers might work. The 2.5"" end fit my shopvac perfectly. So the adapter works fine, but apparently not all manufacturers measure 4"" in the same way. But was worth the price."
4,"Good 4"" hose to 2.5"" hose adaptor","As others have noted, this adapts a 4"" hose to a 2.5"" hose. Such a step-down is useful if you run larger hose throughout most of your shop then drop down to the smaller house where required. This simple adaptor does that task properly. No problems."
4,Keeps my shop clean,"This item was a recommended ""...people also buy..."" when buying the Delta 50-359 12-inch Planer Connect. They do not connect together. Each have the same OD & ID. Searched everywhere for an adapter or PVC pipe with the right dimensions; no luck. Used Gorilla Tape. Works great."
1,Don't buy it.,"The 4 inch end won't fit any of my tools. It is the same size as the tool dust collector. I am going to buy a piece of 4"" sewer pipe to see if it will work to connect this item to my Dewalt Planer, Jet bandsaw, and delta joiner."
1,Check your hose sizes,I purchased this item expecting it to hook up to a standard shop vac hose for catching chips coming off a DeWalt 735 bench top planer. The 2.5 inch outlet will not match up to most large shop vacuums.
1,Not just a cheap Ethernet cable in a fancy package.,"This PS2-specific cable offers many improvements over a standard Ethernet cable. It comes in a stylish blister pack. But what's that you say? Almost all Ethernet cables come in blister packs? Well, here's something you can't say about just any Cat-5E cable--it's blue. That'll match your PS2, right? Oh. Well, um, at least this cable still costs several dollars more than its less-elaborately-branded competition. That's got to count for something."
2,"Sounds good, but....","Well, after owning these headsets for about 3 months, I can honestly say they sound great. They are comfortable and fit my head well, plus the active noise cancellation is somewhat effective. Ok, now the bad news. After carrying them around in my backpack, I noticed the earpads come loose very easily. A simple reattachment procedure solves this annoyance. In addition, the headset is not very durable. The twisting-folding mechanism works, but the headband breaks easily if you use it a lot. I would suggest a non-folding type, they are more durable. I filed these under a lesson learned and suggest that you treat this headset with ""kid gloves"" or you will end up with a broken headset. I am going to try in-warranty repair, but I am dubious of the outcome. Good luck."
1,These Headphones do not noise cancel.,"If your are buying this item based on it being a noise-canceling headphone, look somewhere else. They do work great as a stereo headphone. If you are truly looking for noise-canceling headphones this unit is not it."
3,Attention beginning Art Education Students,"This book is very useful in linking teaching theories with Art. If you are a beginning Art Education Student or Art Teacher, this book would be good if you want to learn about pedagogy in the Art classroom. It asks you to analyze and discuss the different approaches to teaching and learning in the Art classroom. This book gives great suggestions for assessment in the Art classroom. It also contains a section on how to get that teaching job you want."
2,Not functional,"The barometer is a picture of a cloud and an arrow as described. This is the only display relating to weather.The design is attractive. It found the time and date and kept the signal in a basement and on an airplane. The radio reception depends on the antenna placement, but is decent.Not functional:Behind the clock is a control panel. It has 8 buttons: alarm, select, radio, up, down,... You cannot see the clock display and the controls at the same time.Pacific Time is the default. There is no zone button. To set time zone you press `select' until time is flashing, press and hold `select' until ??? then hit the up or down buttons. You have to watch the time and press the buttons blindly. The buttons are bright orange plastic, so folded closed the unit loses appeal."
3,"At Times, Amusing","Appropriate for 3-8 yrs. This book is a great book, if you want to expose children to many different kinds of animals. The illustrations are as good as you will ever see. But, it's really just that--a book of animal illustrations with mildy amusing rhymes thrown in.But, children will probably enoy it nonetheless."
5,Excellent Resource,"This book gave me so many new ideas for marketing! I've been researching book promotion for months and this is one of the best resources I've read yet. Clear, concise and informative, any author should make this book a part of their permanent collection!"
5,Good for the average mechanic,this is better than running out every time you break a vacuum tee. they break often. Now I got a convenient assortment at a reasonable price!
3,Unfortunatley has a Games episode,"Maybe I'm just being picky, but I wasn't aware that this has a Games episode on it until I purchased it.Son of Stimpy: One of the best Spumco episodes. The music score is great, the beginning is hilarious, the backgrounds look realistic, you name it. *****Big Flakes: Ack. This is one of Games' worst, and that isn't saying much. The drawings look terrible, the coloring is drab, it's unfunny, and looks rushed. *Music video: A weird music video of Ren and Stimpy that combines some of the most grossest scenes and badly sung music. The scene selection is good, but the music is best left muted.Bottom line: If you don't have Son of Stimpy and can't find it anywhere else, get this. Otherwise, leave it."
5,Perfect for my application,"This is a fairly light duty hose. I would not recommend it for any sort of a permanent installation (use something more substantial). For temporary hook-ups it's PERFECT!. I bought some ""FazLok"" connectors from Woodworker's Supply to temporarly connect my dust collector to my mobile table saw, band saw, and drill press. I'm using a 15' length of hose which fits into a 3 foot length of 6"" plastic drain pipe for storage (including the FazLok connectors). I've attached a short piece of copper wire to the the wire in the hose and connected the wire to a magnet (to attach to the metal part of my table saw). It takes only a second or two to attache the FazLok connector and ground my system. Highly recommended!"
4,Very Happy so far,"I was a little worried about this hose but have been very happy after running 80+"" in my shop to 6 machines. I have a Grizzly 1 1/2 hp DC and have no complaints.Sid"
2,You get what you pay for,"I have a 2HP system and this hose will collapse in many situations. It can be useful in short runs as a branch between the machine and the main vac line, but will collapse if it is part of the main line.If you locate your blast gate BETWEEN this hose and the vac, you should be OK. The plastic is very thin, so don't use it in exposed locations where users may rub against it or cutoffs might fall on it."
1,Stay away from this hose!,"This hose is JUNK! A poor excuse for a shop tool/supply, it is simply dryer hose! Don't buy it, or you'll end up returning it like I did!"
3,cheap but okay,I would not use this hose for very heavy use. It certainly is a bargain but it telescopes so much that it is fairly light. I am going to use it for now but am concerned that the hose will break easily. It's not bad for light use or for someone not willing to invest in a heavier quality hoseRalph
3,Don't use this for permanent connections!,"If I had this purchase to do over again I would have invested in better quality hose. This stuff is VERY flexible and it collapses with ANY amout of vacumm resistance. Because of this the inside surface is rougher and more resistant to airflow. I'd say it's great for applications where you need mobility because it's so flexible, but a poor choice for permanent connections to your machines."
1,Editorial Review misleading,"I can kick myself for not reading these reviews before I ordered it. This is the worst thing I have ever recieved (not worth the postage). Sure, the price is less. If I wasn't in such dire need I would return it immediately. As it is, I will just temporarily use it until my ""real"" dust collection hose arives (from Trend-Lines) and then just throw it out.By the way it may not colapse with suction but if you don't trim your fingernails before you take it out of the box you will most likely slice the thin membrane that holds it together. The picture and Ed Review are misleading."
4,PSI Woodworking D50A 4-Inch x 50 Flexible Dust Collection Hos,"good quality, though the plastic over the wires could be thicker. You might not want it to ride on an abrasive survace. Minimal flex with vacume changes"
1,You get what you pay for,"There is a reason this hose is inexpensive - it's cheaply made and not very good dust collection hose. As a matter of fact its pretty much just dryer hose in black plastic. I'm not returning mine because I should have known better, but I'm pretty disappointed."
3,Inexpensive dust collection system,"I bought this hose to set up a cheap dust collection system for my shop. I liked the idea of using a flexible hose system instead of hard plumbing because I wanted the option of rearranging the system as my shop grows. Plus I wasn't sure of the best way to organize the dust collection a priori.This hose allows an inexpensive way to set up dust collection.That being said it does have it's share of problems. First of all, the copper support line (and grounding wire) presents problems when you cut the hose into segments. Secondly, if you use a reducer, the hose tends to collapse (accordian-style) under the vacume. Otherwise, I have't had problems. On the positive side, I haven't had any problems with debris collecting in the hose despite the uneven internal surface."
4,Great product for limited applications,"This is not a hose that you would even think about for running permanent duct work but if you have mobile tools, are trying different placements for you tools or need a collector line to run around the shop for clean up, then this works great. I use short lengths of this to run from my blast gates to the tool inlets simply because I have a new shop and have found that I need to adjust placement of my tools fairly often. If I had used inflexible or expensive hose, I would be reluctant to move them and just made do, but since I bought a box of this, I can leave some extra on each gate and reposition my tools with ease. I roll out my planer and don't have to connect and disconnect the hose since it simply expands and contracts as needed. I also have found it works well when you have to run it across the floor (no other way to get it to my table saw) and accidentally step on it. It collapses and springs back much better than my old ankles do."
4,"Inexpensive, works well.","Okay, I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out that fifty feet of tubing has to pack flat in order to make free shiping affordable, so I think the whining about it being flimsy is unwarented. The fact is that it is very light weight, and it does tend to compress when you turn on your collector. Clearly, if you anchor the tubing with hangers, this problem won't occur. I view this product as a good deal at less than half the price of the more ridgid tubing.The one thing that causes the loss of a star: It smells really funny when you take it out of the box. After out-gassing for a few days, it was fine. But, people with chemical sensitivities should be weary."
3,"4"" Dryer Hose Anyone?","Very Flexable, but very soft. If dryer type hose is what your application calls for, this is the stuff for you..."
1,a real owl would have been better,"it did not sound any thing like an owl, more like a horn for 'Happy New Year party "" it scared my cat away."
3,How come mine came with 4 discs? It says on the cover that the 4 film favorites dvd only comes with 2-double sided discs?,How come mine came with 4 discs? It says on the cover that the 4 film favorites dvd only comes with 2-double sided discs. Did I received pirated or copied DVDs?
1,DISK DAMAGED,"The second disk does not play right, it freezes up on chapter 5 and the stays froze, I could not fastforward or skip a chapter. I also could not get to the movie menu to pick a scense selection."
4,4-in-1..,"This is a great compilation.All of the first 4 F.D.s together. 2 double-sided discs so each movie is still full length.The only drawback I found is, the writing is so small it's hard to tell what movie is on which side. I had to mark each disc with bigger numbers. Why couldn't they have scripted 1, 2....etc on each side?That aside, I love this set."
1,Final Destination Collection-4flim,"This procuct has many flaws...The Third film has many pauses in it just like the one at the rental stores. Whoever put this out just copied the same crap that was already out there, and compressed the 4 movies to fit on 2 CD's. There was also some pixelating as well. I own a plethera of movies and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Don't waste your time buying. If you try to get these movies individually you'll have the same problem with the third movie as in this seires. The others (1,2 and 4-3D will be okay). The problem is with #3. Note: They copied the same crap that was already out there!"
4,Final destination 4,"As horror movies go,i was thrilled to watch these four prior to seeing the 5th (final?) I love having the full series on 1 disk.Great product, great price, fast service!"
2,unsure,I am unsure about this movie as when we put it in the dvd player to watch the other sides of it for some reason it wouldn't play or it wasn't there. So I can't give a good review on this one...
5,im happy,"I love it, it was delivered in a reasonable amout of time and i am very pleased. thank you very much"
3,Rough language,The other two Final Destination movies that I have bought do no have as much foul/obscene language. Very distracting to me.
4,Perfect set of movies,"The reason I gave this four stars is because when I bought it There was only four final destinations. So if you want the whole collection do not get this one. and don't get it for the bonus features there aren't that many. And the fourth movie I think sucked, maybe I should have gave this three stars"
5,great films,The best buy ever I love the films I can't stop watching them this film I would say is a must buy if you like films with blood in it
3,cluttered,"This product is a great deal, by 4 for the price of 1. Only problem is all of the DVDS are stuck together in one holder. I thought if you bought something like this they would atleast put the DVDS on their own slots so they wouldnt get messed up. The DVDs are not cheap looking or bootlegged. They are as if you would buy them separately. Overall this is a good deal, I have no issues other than all the DVDs put together in one spot."
5,final destenation,I love all the final destination movies I remand who didn't see them should get I think you will like then
1,disappointed,"two of the movies part 3 and part 2 were unwatchable, they would freeze up and then jump ahead a few chapters"
1,Read the fine print....,We love British comedy and were quite excited to find Father Ted on DVD. We did not read the fine print. The DVDs only play on Region 2 DVD players...... Fail.... Epic fail:(
2,Serious Fans Only,"I say serious fans only because these recipes are almost universally too time consuming and difficult for the average--or even advanced--home cook. If you're someone who seriously loves Emeril Lagasse, then you might want this book since his personality is stamped into it and it does have charm and some nice illustrations of delicious-looking dishes, but what I said up there stands: this is for show, not real life use. Without a lot of experienced help, you're not going to be able to create most of the items featured in here, and isn't a cookbook supposed to be about fixing the foods listed within it?"
2,I need an army of kitchen staff,"Boy, it was not easy to follow the recipes. Keep in mind that Emeril has an army of kitchen staff to do the prep work and the cleaning afterwards. I worked as a chef before and I found the book too far fetched for a home kitchen. I also agree with other reviewers that it's not a pretty book to display."
5,BAM!,"Yet another book from the master chef! It is filled with tasty recipies for delicious dishes. It's the closest thing to actually being on his awesome show.If you like food (which I know a lot of people do) and you enjoy watching Emeril ""kick it up a notch"" on the food channel. Then you owe it to yourself and your hungry stomach to get this book."
4,Another yummy Emeril book,"I really like Emeril. I've made a few of his recipes and they've always turned out to be yummy. So when I got this book, I had high hopes, and Emeril did not let me down. The book has a lot of recipes and they are all very original, interesting recipes (often quite complicated, but again this are the best recipes from his restaurants). The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars, it's that in the other Emeril's books tradition, this book also didn't have a lot of photos. I just really prefer seeing what the end result should look like before I cook, especially with appetizers and entrees."
1,For Chefs Only,"If you have 3 hours to prepare the entre, can purchase exotic ingrediants and have the ability to make a foam sauce this book is for you. If you are an average working class bottom feeder spend the money on fast food rather than this book."
5,"Excellent, love the map",the mape is very nice and in wonderful condition. it arrived promptly and was safely packaged. it is very pretty
1,Buy what you need individually.,"Thought I would save a few bucks by buying this kit instead of individual items. I started by trying to install the table saw hood. Notice there is no part # or size listed, well it came with a 12"" hood for a small contractor's saw. I needed (and most tables saws need) a 14"" hood. Well I was able to make it work with some good old duct tape. Next promlem was I could not get the hose to stay clamped to the outlet. So I unducktaped the whole thing figuring I wasn't aligning it right working under the saw.Turns out the outlet is tapered so when you tighten the clamp it forces the hose to slide off. BTW the description says you get G2974 clamps, but it actually came with inferior JW1022 clamps.If you order one you might get the one I am returning."
3,Not that good of a value -,"You may want to look at other sources of Dust Collection Accessories Kits. If you are using a small dust collector then this may work. A large system you will want to use rigid piping and minimize the flexible tubing. Flexible tubing causes reduction in vacuum - the longer the run the less efficient your dust collector is.Other accessory kits are available through Penn State Industries aka ""pennstateind"" or Grizzly that may have more variety of components at a competitive price."
3,good listening,"This is a great addition to the Landover series. The producers put maximum tracks on the CD, which is good for going back and catching up on a missed section, but it is EXCESSIVE. I listen to audiobooks to help me fall asleep. It becomes irritating to advance to track 79 of 120 or so to relisten, by the time you adjust the CD back to where you fell asleep, you are wide awake. Maybe half as many tracks would be a better use of resources."
5,Beautiful marriage of photographs and text.,"Photographer and cultural theorist Victor Burgin puts his two talents to good use in this book. Some Cities combines Burgin's thoughts on the way cities live in our consciousness with photographs he has taken in cities to striking effect. Burgin clearly loves his subject. A fine addition for anyone who has enjoyed Burgin's theory (see, for example, ""The End of Art Theory"") and would like to see how he applies them toward his own artistic expression. Very highly recommended."
2,Good history but dull,"I was intrigued enough about the historical facts surrounding Hiroshima that this title appealed to me. It is actually two POVs sewn into one movie - an American version and a Japanese version shot by a Japanese director. That makes it interesting enough in parts...but this movie is far too dull for long stretches. In the end, watch it on cable - that's what it was made for anyways!"
5,Worked Great for Me With XP Professional.,"The negative reviews of Goback 4.0 caused me to seek out 3.0, which seems to be more widely admired. A great experience for me. 3.0 works perfectly on my computer with Windows XP Professional. Goback is great insurance to step back from problems on your system."
3,It can be useful at times,"I found this program useful when my computer had some sort of error with it or a program mysteriously would cease to function, but it would not always solve the problem because it would either erase useful information or it would revert the wrong files!!Other than that it can be usefully."
1,don't buy plastic blast gates,"These blast gates crack easily, and are a constant frustration. I was able to find aluminum ones for the same money, so I bought those and plan to replace all the plastic ones. Aluminum gates are much more durable."
1,don't bother with plastic; get metal,"6"" plastic gates are a junk. They crack, leak, and are not fixable. You can buy metal ones for not much more $, and they are way better."
3,They taste fine but I won't order again,"I bought these after I switched to eating all whole grains as an alternative to regular egg noodles. They taste fine but they're really nothing special. The noodles are also pretty narrow and I had hoped for something wider. My biggest complaint though was how several of the bags (I think it was 4) popped open during shipping and I ended up throwing them out since I didn't want to use a product from an opened bag. If they had a better way to ship these they might be worth buying again but as for me, I'm going to try to find another whole wheat egg noodle."
2,"Nice, but go for stainless steel","Nice caddy, but didn't last 6 months until rust set in. I just ordered a stainless steel caddy to replace this one. Basically wasted my $$ on this one. I should have known better. Though the stainless steel caddy is nearly twice as much, I'm hoping it will last at least a few years. If you are like me and don't like buying things that don't last, I would recommend spending the extra $$ up front to get the stainless."
2,Beware! Not chrome,"The ""chrome"" version is not in fact chrome, it is just painted with a metal colored paint. Don't know how that will effect the longevity.Otherwise, it seems fine. Go for the cheaper white one if you do decide to buy this, as they are both just painted metal."
4,Tension Pole Caddy - Love it!,"I researched tension pole caddies for quite a while before finding this one. It has several posts for hanging things like a shower puff and back washers as well as having holes for hanging razers. My favorite part is the draining soap dish. The tape for securing the pole does not stick, but I don't see the need for it any way."
3,does what it says but...,"This this an ok shower caddy that is nice for showers without any kind of shelving. I have mine installed in shower that is very tall and it fit with no problem. Baskets/shelves are big enough to hold whatever you need.My one complaint is that mine has developed rust rather quickly. I think it was just 2-3 months before I noticed it. Still works fine, but doesn't look as nice. Because of the short life the paint had, I'm knocking off a couple of stars.If you really care about something that will last, I'd go with another product. The concept is great, so something that looks like this will work well for you. Get stainless steel or something that won't rust though, if you think appearance is going to be an issue."
1,Very disappointed,"We purchased the brushed (nickel?) version of this shower caddy about 8 months ago. It was perfect, easy to install, just what we wanted. At least for a couple of months. Rust began to set in, first on the pole, now on the shelves, especially the most solid of the shelves. It's hard to believe that a manufacturer would create a shower caddy that was susceptible to rust - not many of us have waterless showers.We'll have to replace it, and soon. I'll avoid Zenith in the future as a result."
5,handy and stylish,"Great piece for the bathroom, though hard to assemble. Looks good and holds many items."
1,Ugly addition to my shower!,This shower caddy is an ugly addition to my shower. Further no matter how I adjust the Baskets they tilt and are not steady. The basket's wires are so far apart that small items fallout. I would not recomend this item to even my worst enemy and would not buy it again!!!
4,solid product,I had a plastic version of this which I had bought at Lowe's. It lasted a good while but became brittle and the shelves broke. I liked the way it worked in my shower. I found this one and decided to take a chance. So far it has worked well. The directions were a little confusing but I eventually figured it out. The true test will be whether it will hold up and not rust. I will update this review after I have used it for a good amount of time.
4,Color,The caddy is great and easy to assemble. The only almost problem that the satin nickel doesn't match all the other fixtures in the bathroom that are satin nickel. It is more of a matted color.
3,"looks pretty, but poor craftsmanship","**refers to the brushed chrome model**the shower caddy does its job. but it could do it a lot better, and it could have been constructed with more care and precision.the holes for a razor or toothbrush on the smooth shelf are too small for the razors we use (gilette venus). one of the shallow baskets was soldered on to its base at an angle, so no matter what i do the basket is crooked. not very useful for holding full bottles of shampoo or face wash. and, most corners are at about a 90 angle, but the baskets and shelves are at a greater than 90 angle, which means they don't fit in a corner very well!so it fits in the shower okay and holds our stuff, but it's not very well made and you can certainly find better for the price."
5,A story for all ages,"This is an amazing story of coincidences, intrigue, and patriotism combined to involve the reader in a refresher course in the history of World War II. A truly enjoyable read for all ages."
5,The Gold Buckle,"This was a book I had to finish reading before I turned the light out. Do to his fathers service to Hitler, this young American could serve his country, the USA, from within the WW-2 German Army. He had access to some of the top German government officials and also highly classified documents that he was able to supply to the U.S.The fact that the Girl and love story was real and not congenered up for the book is also great stuff.Dr. Chuck Gibb was able to turn a true life experience into a great novel.I highly recommend it!!Admiral Richard K. Maughlin, Ret."
5,Grrr...,"Sorry, I don't really have a whole lot to say about this recording, but the reviewer below's one star was really bugging me. This is a great selection of Couperin's whimsical harpsichord music, delightfully played and thoroughly enjoyable. And about Naxos, it is the only label out there today pursuing a systemic and affordable approach to the recording of classical music and offers home listeners and collectors a chance to listen to beautiful works of music that would never be available from major record labels like Deutsche Grammophon."
5,must see,"This movie helped my family understand. The first of three segments will have you sobbing and making legal arrangements, the second helps you come to terms with history, the third is your life, today, and is joyous and fun and filled with hope for a better day. We will play this music at our wedding. (We are learning to dance now!)"
3,Mixed bag for hetero males,"From the point of view of any hetero male, the second story was the one most worth watching, for obvious reasons. Thumbs up.For slightly more sophisticated hetero males, the first story was pretty good. Interesting to see treatment of a subject (lack of legal standing in a same-sex union and what happens when a partner dies). I kept wanting to scream at Vanessa: ""This is why we have wills!"" Thumbs up.The third story was very trite and superficial, considering the seriousness of the subject metter, and boring to boot. Thumbs down."
5,Beautifully Done,"A movie I will always hold close to my heart. So straight forward, without euphemisms and ploys or innuendos. A serious look at a lifestyle enjoyed by some (my opinion) and misunderstood by most. Vanessa Redgrave's performance knocked me for a loop."
4,Intersting and good...,"This movie presents the lives of lesbians, all of whom have lived in the same house, in three seperate ""chapters"". The movie spans over 40 years. The first piece is about two older lesbians and is set in the early 1960's. One of the women dies and you see how people outside the relationship deal with the surviving partner. It is touching, yet a reminder of why we need to be so vigilant.The second piece is set in the 70's. While it is interesting to see the development of the consciousness of the young women, it is a bit sterotyped.The final pice is set only a few years ago. It is current, funny (after all Ellen Degeneres is in it) and sexy (Sahron Stone is in it). It deals with modern issues in serious and light-hearted ways. Taken all together the three pieces tell a very interesting story of lesbians and how their lives haved changed over the decades. I think it is especially important for younger women who need to know about the lives of the women who came before them."
1,No Way!,"Please!! Not Sharon Stone! Our FISH! She's a PISCES for goodness sake!! She SURE wouldn't fit there! Sharon is a great artist, but sometimes I don't know how on earth she pick her roles..: / You can read her unconvinced face through out her role. She's so much an angle/child/woman/mathematician! She's too good for this! Yes, too good to be true!"
1,"Right DVD, Wrong region!","I was looking forward to getting the DVD for Christmas, but was very disappointed to find it was for region 1, rather than for region 4, as I live in Australia.I can't play it and did send an email of complaint, but have received no answer. I think it is only fair that I am sent one for the right region. Otherwise, I would never consider using AMAZON.COM again."
3,What would they have to say?,"The first story is the poignant tale of two elderly women and how one is left to cope with the untimely death of her partner of decades. Additionally, she is left to deal with the family members of her deceased partner while having no place to turn in her own grief.The second story is good for learning to accept people as they are and not trying to change them.The last is a good comedy about trying to get a baby in their life."
4,Inspirational yet scary?,"If These Walls Could Talk 2 made me cry made me think and made me laugh out loud. Each story has its lesson to teach and make us reflect upon. Personally, seeing how so much changed from one decade to another made me really believe that some day things will change for the better...."
5,A Must Have In Any Dyke's Collection,I can not believe we haven't had a single customer's review of this movie thus far! I remember seeing this movie on HBO and boy...was I impressed! The first two stories are heart wrenching and real tear jerkers -- even for the toughest dyke's out there. The third story is more...artfully done without as much substance. Though I love that there was a story with a soon-to-be parents couple. That'll be us one day....:)
4,Good stories,"The first story in particular will touch the heart of any lesbian couple. It concerns 2 older women in the 60's who were together many years and had to be in the closet due to society. One partner dies and the other has the brutal aftermath to face, including having to pretend to her partner's family that they were just friends. All gay couples--please have a durable power of attorney, so your partner has a voice in what happens to you!...the second story, the 70's--very [explicit] scene between two lovely women!the third story--two women trying to conceive. Although enjoyable, Sharon Stone and Ellen Degeneres, lack sufficient chemistry."
5,Fantastic,"Three generations and all three stories are compelling, intriguing, emotional and beautifully acted and directed. If you like ""If These Walls Could Talk"" you will absolutely LOVE ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"". Vanessa Redgrave, Chloe Seveign, Ellen Degeneres, and Sharon Stone all give stunning, true-to-life performances. A GREAT movie to own and watch again and again."
3,More about jungle survival than motorcycling,"For me the story really bogged down when he got into the jungle. Got tired of reading about winching the bike up the hill then winching it down the next one, getting caught in bushes, slipping and sliding, etc. If you are into extreme physical effort you might enjoy this."
3,Obsessions do die,"As I read Mr. Culberson's book, I got to thinking that perhaps this obsession should have been let go. I understand the drive to cross an area like the Darien Gap, but in the face of so many failures I think there could be a reason. I admire the determination that was shown in this book but perhaps motorcycles aren't the all terrain vehicles that some see them to be.This is a knock down drag out book that took some determination to finish. I am glad that the book was written so that I can by-pass that area of the globe and not wonder why."
3,Only for the hard core,"I'll read anything about motorcycle travel but I would skip this if that doesn't sound like you. Culberson writes like you might expect a military man to. Fairly dry, straightforward and lacking in stylistic prose. It's not really a bad thing since you probably don't care if what you want to hear is the story of motorcycle adventure.Personally I ended up a bit disappointed in the actual way in which the trip was done - it almost felt like cheating to me. Being towed halfway through the 80 mile Gap and then going home to rest and repair the bike only to return the following year to complete towing the bike seems like saying you ran a marathon 26 one mile runs a day. He did do it though so hat's off to him. I think the time the book was written was the beginning of the whole ""adventure traveler"" thing so you'll read this now wondering why the hell he didn't take a bike 200lbs lighter. Oh well."
3,Not THAT Bad,"Although this double album does have less then admirable sound quality, and although many of the tunes are poorly put together, it still remains not just a bargin, but a pleasure to hear and own. Listen to ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", ""If"" and ""Help Me Make It Through the Night"". Sure, other Hartman discs are better, such as ""Songs from the Heart"", ""(with) Coltrane"" and ""The Voice That Is"", but never the less, this collection contains songs that are originally okay, and then made fantastic by Hartman's voice. Johnny can simply take anything and turn it into gold."
1,Beware......,"Avoid this cd like the plague! If you are like me, A johnny Hartman junkie. You may have heard him one the Bridges of Madison County CD or on the absolutely brilliant John coltrane/Johnny Hartman CD and loved those and wanted more. Please, I repeat please do not buy this CD. It looks like it's a bargain because it's two albums on one cd. It looks like a bargain becauase it's a little cheaper than some of his other cd's. DO NOT BUY IT ! What's wrong with this one. First of all the sound quality is awful. What we have here is a Cd that hisses and sounds low. Second the music, The music is awful. How they can have one of the most wonderful balladeers singing pop tunes raindrpos keep falling on my head and Betcha by golly wow is beyond me. It's ovious it was all about the money. There are dozens of other Johnny Hartman Cd's that are 1000 times better. Suggestions: Songs from the heart, For trane ans I just dropped by to say hello."
2,Not for big hands,"The shape and size is such that men with large hands will have a lot of trouble. The narrower front combined with the stiff buttons that are located too far forward cause the mouse the push backward. There is too little room for the thumb on the side to allow one to hold the mouse still with the thumb without pressing the side buttons too. It is difficult to pick the mouse up without the thumb pressing the side buttons. In fact, I had to type this review twice because an accidental press of the side buttons caused the first review to be lost. The mouse might be better suited to child-sized hands."
4,Very nice.,"While it's not as nice as the one with Red sides, it is a good looking mouse and functional. Came quickly and well packaged."
3,This thing is HUGE,"From the pictures, it doesnt look so bigbut it is.It has a nice feel to it though"
4,Looks great - works :),I bought this for my son thinking that it would be a totally cheap mouse. I was pleasantly surprise by the look and feel of the mouse. You are not going to get precision pointing from mouse in this price range but I recommend it for any parent looking to buy a cool mouse for their kids.
5,Good fit,"Fit well and they get good traction on wet surfaces. I like them. I use them in Afghanistan to get to and from the shower and they work great on the loose gravel over here. Fast shipping, too."
5,Get 'em,I recommend that you stop searching and get these if youi want quality. I've worn them everywhere and they hold up and keep a good grip.
5,Modi flip flops,"I have plantar fasciitis, theses are the best shoes for this problem. I can wear them pain free. I can not go bear foot, so I wear these flip flops everywhere."
5,LOVE These!,"Item just arrived today. I slipped them on and was in heaven! I personally think they are pretty ugly but boy are they comfy!! No break in period. Nice and cushioned and supportive, especially for a flip flop. Buy these- you won't regret it!"
5,Squooshy comfort,"This is my first pair of crocs flip flops. Oh why oh why did I wait so long to buy one? This one has so much squooshy/comfy support at the feet. It feels like I'm walking on gel. However, I always have issues w/ the toe strap w/ all toe strap flip flops/sandles. This wasn't an exception. It's not incredibly uncomfortable but my skin gets a little red. I can still walk in them for a few hours though, which is a big change from my old J.Crew/Old Navy etc flip flops which were unbearable after a few strides. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again."
4,"Comfy, slightly big","These flips were what I was looking for, comfy and easy to wear. The run slightly large (length-wise) on my foot compared to other flips I own. I bought them through Amazon, and they arrived quickly."
2,Now made in China. Left in car overnight. One flip shrunk a FULL SIZE!,"This is my second pair of these flip flops. I loved the first pair, however I made the mistake of going to the beach and then leaving them in my car overnight. One of them shrunk a FULL SIZE! That is completely unacceptable! They are now in the trash. I wore them 10 times and they were perfect. My second pair (1 year later) is NOT the same as my first pair. The quality has diminished greatly. They were comfortable while they lasted. Very cheap rubber. I took a picture, but couldn't figure out how to upload it. Seeing is really believing!"
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"I had such high hopes for these, but I was so SORELY mistaken. They are light, not heavy or clunky which was nice but they are in NO WAY shape or form comfortable or at all supportive. Sent them back and bought what I should have gotten in the first place, another pair of SKECHERS Reggae Rasta's."
4,Crocs flip-flops are amazingly comfy!,"I love these flip flops so much, they are very comfortable! Worth the money, because they last. They have great traction, so they are very good for multi-purpose use, as well as being comfy so that they don't hurt your feet through extended wearing."
5,best flip-flops but with one tiny flaw,these are the best flip-flop I have had but the tiny flaw is that the front part inbeetween your toes break within 5-9 months
1,It hurts,When you use this flip flops it hurts you feet and then you can-t use any flip flop for some days. They have ruin my beach holidays!!
4,I Like them,I like them. It was not my favorite color but they were exactly what my mother wanted adn she really liked them
4,Great flip! Runs small.,"I did not order these on Amazon and it is a good thing I didn't. These flip-flops, while very comfortable, run really small. I wear a 10.5 size shoe and 11 in sandals and flip-flops. My first pair of Crocs (Crete style, years ago. Side note: I had those flip-flops for at least 4 years and they just wore out last month, and I wore them almost every single day and walked miles a day in them as well..too bad those are no longer being made)...Anyways, my first pair of Crocs I ordered in a size 11, perfect comfy fit. The Modi style, however, run small. I found them at my local shoe department, and tried on size 11, instantly painful. I kept going up in size until I reached 13, then it was perfect. That's quite a huge leap from 11 to 13.I was originally going to order a size 11 from here, but am so glad I found a store to try them on instead. Great flip-flop, very comfortable, feels durable, but runs really small.I recommend you find a store to try them on."
3,alright,"Not ad comfy as I had hoped, the tread is wearing down quickly, may be alright for occasional use but not an everyday slipper."
5,Modi Flip,First time purchased Crocs... LOVE! Basically they feel better than anything else on my feet. They are the most comfortable flip ever worn.
5,great looking on my husband - love crocs,You can't beat the look or comfort of this shoe and very good reasonably priced too! There may be look alikes but they don't come close to the real thing!
5,Great during pregnancy,"I've been wearing these sandals non-stop since I got them. All of my other shoes stopped fitting in my second trimester but I didn't want to buy a bunch of other shoes. These sandals are really light but still provide good support for your feet. Amazon had the cheapest price I could find, they're actually $10 more on Zappos.UPDATE:These sandals have been a God send, I literally wear them every day. Although they're kind of sporty for work, my team my sympathetic and understood they were the only shoes I could actually fit me feet into. I would definitely get these again!"
5,FANTASTIC !!,"I bought a pair size 12 for my son who is temporarily disabled from broken bones in his feet and subsequent foot pain. This makes walking without a cane very difficult for him. The size 12 fit perfectly by the way - did not run small. My son, who walks very little due to the pain, slid his feet into these shoes and tentatively took a few steps. Then more steps and more steps - he just wouldn't stop walking around the house saying, ""Wow - I mean Wow - I mean REALLY WOW"". I watched him walk down the driveway and back, whereupon he reported the fit and cushioning of the these Crocs felt better than Orthopoedic Shoes. GREAT JOB CROCS!!!"
1,true to the size,"Order it for my man. It is our first Crocs. I order a size larger due to the previous reviews. But I should say I am wrong. I can not compare with other Crocs and never own it before. But compare with the regular shoes, they are true to the size. It is probably because my husband's foot is narrow. But I do love the quality and price. Since it is a flip anyway, I will keep it.update: the shoe fall apart from the middle center after a year. Not that happy. Will figure out how to repair it."
3,one hit,"Good enough, I guess. I got this for the hit ""Pied Piper.""The rest is okay. He has a nice voice.Though there is a nice version of ""You Were on My Mind."""
4,Terrific value!,"I bought all three discs in this series and heartily recommend them. At the price, you can't go wrong. My favorite is the first volume--after the opening waltz and two OK numbers, you'll find one lovely tune after another. I listen to this in my car and it shortens my perception of the commute.The recording is very good and the artists are pleasing to listen to. I don't care as much for the Fledermaus songs in the third volume, as the voices don't stand up to the caliber of Kiri Te Kanawa and others on the Previn Fledermaus disc--but they are still nice renditions."
4,A Great Pleasure,"Treat yourself to these wonderful records (this one, plus the other two volumes). It's the best collection of Viennese operetta I know. The voices aren't the best--the tenor especially can be squally at times. No, this isn't Tauber or Schwarzkopf, but enjoy it for what it is: three hours of sheer pleasure."
5,Fixer - A great Film,"""Fixer: The Taking of Ajmal Naqshbandi"" is a great documentary that follows the relationship between an Afghan interpreter and his client, American journalist Christian Parenti. This intimate portrait of two colleagues shifts dramatically when Ajmal is kidnapped along with an Italian reporter. The situation goes from bad to worse as foreign powers pressure for fast results, the Afghan government bungles its response and the specter of Taliban power looms in the background. What follows is the tragic story of one man forgotten in the crossfire: a brutal allegory of the proud land and perilous misadventure that is Afghanistan.This is an extremely interesting look at the Afghan government and I really learned a great deal. The storyline allows it to be both educational and interesting. This documentary definitely kept me at the edge of my seat."
4,And a sequel?,"With the knowledge I gained from this excellent book, I plan to follow this with the classic, ""Personality Games Survivalists Play,"" by the Donner Party family."
2,Not near his best,"Nouwen is a great man, a gifted writer, and well aquainted with emotional suffering, but this book is only a short ""journal"" of a few random thoughts. I don't think it has the potential to actually help many people through their own pain, but perhaps it may resonate with others in a way that escaped me. I would recommend any of his other books over this."
4,Nouwen's Seeking Heart,"Of Nouwen's books, this one has a deeper vulnerability than the others. I have always appreciated his organic spiritual depth and relational intimacy with God, but this book is different. It's raw, personal and vulnerable - and therefore very helpful. Not many men (males) would come out and say the things he says, and that's part of what makes it refreshing. His search for love and affirmation is more honest than I've read from any other writer and his gift to readers is his willingness to put these expressions in print. The book speaks most powerfully to the inner struggles of doubt and emotional need. If you've never been in that place I doubt the book will mean much, but if you have, you might find it to be water for your desert place."
4,"Honest, soulful","My first journey into the world of Nouwen was well worth the read. Nouwen, the much talked about, often quoted spiritual advisor to millions is worth his weight in gold. Nouwen is beautifully honest, and deep in this book on the journey from ""Anguish to Freedom."" Nouwen writes in stark contrast to other writers such as Willard, or Foster. Nouwen takes you on a process that allows you to figure out the end of the story. His comments on humility and generosity are poignant and dead on. Where will you go? It is up to you and your relationship with God. Nouwen will point you in the right direction. B+Joseph Dworak"
4,The Inner Voice of Love: A Journey Through Anguish to Freedon,"This book, written by Nouwen, is a series of 'imperatives' which he wrote during a very difficult period in his life. It is a kind of spiritual diary and he never intended publishing it, but did so having being encouraged by his friends. Each input can be read and reflected on in isolation and it is recommended that only one be taken at a time.I found the inputs very rewarding and of benefit to anyone during a period of isolation or pain in life. However it is also of value at any time and one can dip into the articles at any period of one's life.I generally read one article before bedtime and found it relaxing and helpful."
1,"A deep, honest spiritual journey","Henry Nouwen's book is wonderful, and I am glad that he decided to publish it. He writes about touching God in the nakedness of aloneness once all of his external supports were stripped away. A very valuable book. One reviewer (""ceolnoth"") fails to see any depth to it. He must've been reading a book by someone named Henry Noonan; the book that I am reading is certainly not the same one he read."
1,not so easy,"I thought it was as described ..... easy, however this software does no provide much and there's this background music which sounds kind of cold. They basically spilt the lesson to three parts which does not follow with everybody's pace. Try another software."
2,Okay book but...,"Generally a fan of classic mysteries, I found myself disappointed in this particular read.The opening scene of a crusty old man drowning did little to arouse my curiosity, followed by the introduction of a family tree so complicated the reader needs a road map to navigate it. By the time the author meandered around to a second death, mysterious bones found buried on the estate grounds, I could have been the corpse involved - cause of death: boredom.While impeccably written with good dialogue, I did not find myself enjoying this particular novel. It took everything I had in me to finish the read in order to provide a thorough review. And to get my money's worth. While others may enjoy this tale, I did not."
4,Compelling read,Gideon is an engaging anthropologist who leads his colleagues and the reader compellingly through the ins and outs of his mystery and its solution.
2,Disappointing,"Old Bones was a little disappointing. While the technical aspects were interesting, the plot was rather transparent and the overall scene was hackneyed. How many mysteries need to take place at a family gathering in an old country estate while key characters are getting bumped off or threatened? The characters were predictable and the coincidences were unbelievable. This was my first experience with Aaron Elkins, and it will probably be my last."
5,Clean and comfortable!,"Clothes are clean and nobody is itching or sneezing - for a family with asthma and allergy issues caused by dyes and perfumes, that result is just what we had wanted from this product. Highly recommended."
5,Great product shipped poorly,"The product is all you would want in a fragrance free detergent that washes clothes like the best of them. However, like another reviewer wrote, Amazon must figure out a way to ship these bottles standing up. The outside carton showed signs of leakage. The inside carton was mostly soaked with detergent. It took 15 minutes to clean all of the bottles off in the bathtub. A simple instruction on the shipping carton to keep one side up, would solve the problem."
3,Shipping problems with liquid soap,"I love this product and have purchased it successfully from Amazon in the past, but this delivery had problems in that the bottles seem to have been thrown into a box where they were able to shift around and get squashed to the point where there was a major leak in one of the bottles and the fluid drenched the entire package contents. What a mess! I'm not sure if I will risk this again."
4,Mess-in-the-Box,"The product is fine - however, that last time it was shipped to me in bulk (9 bottles) several bottles had leaked into the box, thus making a mess on my hardwood floor, not to mention my losing that much of the product. Otherwise, peachy-keen."
2,Packaging and Shipping leaked,There were nine bottles in the box. At least one bottle leaked during shipping because the lids were loose. There was a mess inside the box. I will not order this again from Amazon.
5,5 star recording!,"I have had this CD for several weeks and played it at least 4 dozen times. It takes me a long time to make up my mind on the quality of recordings. But, this is the best Adagio in G I have ever heard. It is played as it was written, clean, clear and crisp. The other 18 pieces, the Oboe Concerto's, are equally well done. If you are serious about classical music you can't afford to miss this recording!"
5,Very nice worth the price.,"First of all let me say that this is very good and worth buying. Next, i just want to comment that, To me it is interesting that if you listen to the difference between the Adagio in g minor and the rest of pieces , it is clear that they are much different.With a part of an Albinoni piece, Remo Giazotto made a sweeping, almost thematic score that seems to have more in common with a movie score than with Albinoni's music from the Baroque era. Just compare the music and you can hear it. But it's all beautiful and worth having. I love it !!"
5,All-Time Favorite Baroque,This is a CD that you can loose yourself in. The Adagio in G Minor is haunting and melancholy and beautiful. All 19 tracks are fluid and wonderful.
2,not what I wanted,I don't like this version of the adagio that was in the original movie Rollerball. That's what I wanted and I thought this would be it. The other tracks are too similar to each other and not interesting.
3,Not the velcro-winged ones.,"Kotex still makes a good product, and Kotex pads with wings are becoming increasingly difficult to find in stores. However the best idea they ever had was adding velcro to the wings. Of course like most great products, they stopped making them. I ordered these hoping I would receive what was advertised, but did not. So just a heads-up if you are thinking of ordering."
4,"Good, not perfect. But good.","The pad is fine. Very absorbent, longer than the 'typical' pad. My only negative comment (not that big a deal really...) are the wings. They are rather small in proportion to the length of the pad. In one sense this is good because they easily wrap around your undies, but, you do run the risk of tiny leaks along the sides because they're small. That is after all the most important benefit to me of wings. I had a little booboo with that because of the small wings. But it's a minor thing than can be handled if you change pads more often (that is, if you're not in the middle of a 4-hour meeting and can't easily run out without people looking you at funny.)"
4,Very good value,First time to buy this product. The reason I chose this is because it is cotton. Very good value. I will buy it again.
4,"Not perfect, but the best I've used so far.","I bought these knowing they no longer make them with velcro wings. It's a shame really. The Velcro wings worked much better than any ordinary sticky wings. I hope one day they'll start making them again, but even without the velcro wings this is still the best pad imo. Yes it still bunches, but not nearly as much as most pads do. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing a pad, it's very comfortable. It's perfect for girls who don't normally have heavy periods, but still need that extra coverage just in case. If you wear these for a long time while sweating, the outer film will start to peel away from the pad. That's the only other negative I can think of, but that rarely happens."
2,I love Blue Rodeo BUT,"I disagree strongly with the previous writers. This is my favorite band. Period. I really think they've lost their inspiration this time around. The first single,Bulletproof, is a song Jim's written many times before. Greg is asleep on this album. I've listened to it countless times and I just can't connect with it. They added horns, strings etc. but there's nothing new here. My favorite song on the album is Stage Door but again it would be the 8th or 9th best song on Five Days in July, the high point of their career. For a recent album by Blue Rodeo, I think Days in Between would be a better choice."
4,re inventing themselves,"I'm a long time Blue Rodeo fan but I'm not afraid to say thatI don't like everthing these guys have done. These guys have re-invented themselves again ,not an easy thing to do, they added strings and horns and it works well. There are one or two weak tracks but most are highly enjoyable. This is a must have!"
2,Comments from the spiritual reviewer,"This book would appeal to readers who want reinforcement of traditional Christian thinking and who don't mind hearing a new version of the same old message. Otherwise, Lucado's inability to probe even slightly below the surface of cliches and the established party line results in a shallow and unsatisfying reading experience. Additionally, Lucado's ideas about love and attack are co-mingled. Ultimately, this confuses the reader about the meaning of love.A Love Worth Giving received a score of 3.875 on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) from the spiritual reviewer."
5,Wonderful performances,This DVD is a wonderful edition and well worth the money. The special ending is a wonderful plus that those who have the VHS version do not have and it's worth getting the DVD to have that ending.
4,Worth keeping it....,"This edition certainly lacks a sort of vividness as we can expect from the real stage. However, better than done at any CD versions and studios overall, when it comes to its vividness.Breathtaking and touching or even rapturous is every single song sung by the ""Dream"" cast in the 10th anniversary concert. All you have to do is just seat yourself back in a pink couch with your lover and replay on and on what your lover asks, singing along together...Until a full movie is released by an ingenious, definitly worth buying and keeping it.The show still goes on to the 16th anniversary at the West End and Broadway, and shall ever to the.... or forever."
4,Pretty good,"The DVD is pretty good. However, having only seen the musical once in London, I was disappointed by the lack of the rotating stage and the general lack of acting in this DVD (compared to the presentation I saw in London).I also have the 3 CD Complete Symphonic Recording, and I just don't think the Valjean on the DVD is anywhere near as good as the one on that CD set.However, the music was great and generally the singers are great as well."
5,Magnificient performance,"First I want to apologize for my writing, I'm form The Netherlands and I'm not write often in English.After I heard the dutch version of Les Miserables, I bought this DVD en was overwelmed. The voices of the main characters are great, at the top the voice of Jean Valjean.The cast is great and the choir wonderful. I must seer (or hear) the music of this DVD at least once a week.I want to recommend it to everyone who loves musicals."
3,See live first!,"The voices are fabulous and will linger in your mind for days after viewing, however the acting version of this amazing musical left me wanting more. Great follow up DVD once you have seen the musical live. If you haven't seen live, don't buy this DVD. It will not offer you the full experiance of such an outstanding story."
4,Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert,Wonderful!!!! I had seen bits and pieces of this production on PBS over the years and finally was able to enjoy it in its entirety and will continue to do so in the future.
4,Incredible production!,"I purchased the DVD version since my wife and I had worn out the tape. Why only four stars? It has nothing to do with the cast or material. I was slightly disappointed at the quality of the picture and soundtrack. It is better than the VHS format, but if you do purchase the DVD be aware it is not up to what you are used to in quality. After having said this I still believe this is one of the best productions ever made. Enjoy."
5,Les Mis is always #1,"This is the best of the best. Hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will EVER see. Colm Wilkinson, Lea Salonga, Michael Ball are all amazing. Fabulous talent, great singing."
4,Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert,"The dream cast performs the music from Les Miserables. Since there is no acting, it is not very exciting to watch, but the performances are superb. However, the visuals that are used add to the performance, so I will choose to play the DVD over the CD."
5,Wow,"I thought it would be strange to just have the people sing and not really do the whole musical, but just seeing their faces and costumes adds so much that you never get just fanatically listening to the cds and waiting for the show to come to town again. I'd never seen Philip Quast or heard him do Javert, and I used to prefer Allam of the London cast, but now I am completely infatuated with Quast's portrayal. Javert is the best character ever invented and Quast is amazing in it. The Javert always makes or breaks the show, in my opinion. Quast is emotional in the role, but not overly. Just perfect. And naturally, Wilkinson is great. Loved his Phantom as well. If you are a Phantom fan as well - check out the original Canadian cast. You know, on this DVD, even the guy who accuses Fantine of outright attacking him is good. You'll love it!"
3,The Broadway version was better,"Now don't get me wrong, Les Miserables is my favorite b'way play, but I watched this video before I went to see the play. I went into the Imperial Theatre in NYC expecting to see people standing in front of microphones. The video left out important songs and details that you need in order to understand the play."
3,I'd rather borrow a copy from the local library,"You'd be better off with the 2CD live recording. The concert is not visually stunning at all, no real acting comes through as all the performers do is stand before their microphones and sing. But then again, this is *the* Les Miz dream cast, and all the performers are perfect for their roles, especially Lea Salonga, Ruthie Henshall, Philip Quast and Colm Wilkinson. Personally, however, I have seen and heard better Thenardiers and Cosettes than the ones here. The 17 Valjeans are amazing though. Buy it if you must, just remember that you've been warned."
3,Bombasic and cheesy,"I guess I am one of the few who has seen this show and of course this ""theatrical event"" and find the music and the story to be so over the top that it is embarassing. The score is repetitive and totally derivitive. The show just never seems to end it drags on and on. Hopefully history will show that people who enjoy this garbage will not be treated to a 75th anniversary production. This tripe along with Phantom of the Opera, Martin Guerre and Miss Saigon are ""of an era"" and hopefully will be consigned to the trashcan of history. Better you go see the Forbidden Broadway version! I certainly hope that the world has grown up a bit.To quote another source. All strum and drang bombast and noise and signifing NOTHING"
1,Not Good at all,"As a fan of Broadway shows, this has to be the worst rendition. The actors all approach a mike on a small stage and sing. THIS ISN'T BROADWAY, C'MON!"
1,"Most ridiculous production, ever","This production is like this:You are watching an opera. But not really an opera.A big orchestra and huge chorus are behind the singers.The singers are standing in a row in front.There is a row of microphone sets in front.The singers are singing recitatives and arias.I mean, what kind of stupid thing is this ?And this is what exactly happens in this DVD production.I felt that I was completely ridiculed and cheated."
2,a review from someone who's seen others,"The video is dumb. The characters don't act, they stand in front of a microphone and sing. Don't buy this video or you will be dissapointed. Trust me. It is much better if you buy a different one."
5,Know what you get!,"This is a wonderful video of a stage performance. Don't expect a ""movie"" with acting and sets and Hollywood glitz but you will find wonderful rich characters that you can ""feel"" and know. I don't believe you will find a better video that captures the music that is 'Les Miz'. I cannot travel to see a live stage show and am thrilled to have this video."
5,Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert,Very enjoyable would recommend to any Les Mis fans. The actors and actresses have great voices and they are great in their character clothing. It is not the stage production but it is great until they do a real stage production on DVD.
4,"Great, considering it was the concert version.","I saw the actual staged version of Les Miserables about a week before I saw this. I am so glad I did. If you have seen Les Miz, and love it (as I do), this DVD is worth it. But it is a CONCERT VERSION, not the actual staged version. Instead of acting, there is subtitles telling you what should be happening. Of course, great music. All of the singers were great, though I liked the Eponine I saw the first time the best. And the singers all did as much acting as they could standing at a microphone with no props or scenery (but they were in costume). The one scene that I thought was very close to the staged version was ""A Little Fall Of Rain"", Eponine's final scene. Very touching.If you buy this, buy it for the music and extras. You won't see much acting. The cd is just as good. But except for an actual taped version of the play, this is the best you can get without leaving home."
5,Just amazing,"What to say...it is just amazing...I just can't stop watching this opera once a time. The opera and actors are sublime, you are like surrounded in this opera and you can't do anything except watching and listening.Marvellous."
3,What shouldn't happen to a Broadway show,"I give this DVD a 3 stars rating 2 stars for the casting and 1 for the performance.Reasons why:1) A Broadway Musical it's not to show it as a concert 'cause it loses the impact of the scenes you see in the real play.2) When you see this concert then you don't wanna see the play 'cause you already know the music with the original casting and orchestra, when they change castings some of the times what they do is mess the musical play.My comment to this DVD is:The casting rules great voices but the performance ..., it's better to buy the CD. It's good to hear not to see the concert, in other words DON'T BUY IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,"The show and music are wonderful, but...","The show and music are wonderful, but this doesn't capture the show. If I am just going to listen to the music, I prefer the ""Complete Symphonic"" CD. If I want to watch the play (and I have seen it about 8 times in various places) I want to watch the play and this does not deliver.Now don't get me wrong, this is good for what it is, but it is not the play. It also cuts out some of the most relevant scenes in the play in my. It is merely some of the best (or at least most famous) performers signing their parts. If you want to have another version of the play this is fine, but if you want to get a flavor of the show, but the CD (above) and wait until they release a real version on DVD (if ever)."
5,The best of the best!,This is the BEST Cast there is for Les Miserables. A fantastic performance by Ruthie Henshall as Fantine and Lea Solanga is the very best Eponine. Hannah Chick as Young Cosette was beutiful. She is simply adorable. By this tape! It is the most woderful thing you'll ever see!
5,A Performance Masterpiece,"As an avid fan of Les Miserables, I have seen the stage production 6 times...and undeniably, the The Tenth Anniversary Concert performance has been the best yet. It is a dream cast. Colm Wilkenson emotes the passion of a man who fights an emotional struggle to do what is right. Philip Quast is the best Javier by far, and Michael Ball...well enough said. Lea Salonga and Ruthie Henshall each have a voice that is pure and captures your undivided attention. This performance of Les Miserables is a must see and must own for the fan of musical theater."
2,DVD or what?,"The merits of the performances contained in this concert cannot be argued. It is simply marvelous and will serve as an apt intro to those who haven't seen the Broadway show and a pleasant reminder to those who have. Technically, Mr. Macintosh (sic) used to be more demanding of his technical people. The audio is so-so and not up to DVD standards. Stereo yes, multiple digital stereo.....NO! The picture quality leaves much, much, too much to be desired. Grainy parallel columns (much like interference patterns)are evident in many of the dark background scenes. DVD is notable for its truly black, blacks and ""no snow"" backgrounds and dark scenes. In many scenes a ghost image appears to the right of the singer. Come on gentelmen! You ask top dollar and then do a half job? I cannot recommend this one on DVD...save some and buy the VHS version. It is superior...and it shouldn't be!"
5,A must Have for the theater lover.,The intricate use of acting out songs in a concert setting brought the entire DVD to life. Outstanding performers and memorable songs. GET IT!
5,A Dream Come True,I have never seen Les Miserables before onstage but own almost every Les Mis cd and book imaginable along with alot of Les Mis movies and in my opinon this DVD is well worth it's pricetag...when I first bought I thought it was going to be the show onstage...But is simply the actors in costume onstage singing...and you occasional do see some action scences...Les Miserables fans it has all our favorites and the best of the best performers from the worldwide hit musical including Michael Ball and Colm Wilkson Les Miserables fans! Watching it is like watching absolute magic onstage...My favorite part is at the end when Jean Valjean's from across the world from Norway to the USA all sing onstage together followed by fireworks and bows...this DVD is a treasure for all Les Mis fans evrywhere!
5,Salonga's On My Own alone worth the price of this CD,"Far too infrequently do history, music, lyric, singer and event all converge for one, seemingly frozen moment in time that leaves the listener so amazed.A majestic 1890s tale provides a backdrop that frames many life realities...class, hope, love, war, and death. This Les Miserables sub plot of a teenage girl from the slums of Paris smitten by a university student who hardly knows she exists.A lush, yet dynamic ballad stretches the artist's capabilities. Few have the range and talent to deliver this song with the emotion its powerful lyrics require.Enter Lea Salonga whose portrayal of Eponine is defined by her soaring performance of On My Own. Every syllable, every word is enunciated and completed flawlessly.On its 10th anniversary, an all-star cast assembled at The Royal Albert Hall in London for a ""Best of Les Miz"" concert.With so many forces so perfectly aligned, how fortunate this classic moment was captured forever."
4,Silly B-Movie Fun!,"A teen's boyfriend keeps her out past curfew one too many times. Her parents ship her off to a private Catholic boarding school, and that's where the fun begins--well, for the viewer at least. Hilarious are the scenes where the goofy boyfriend (with the help of two equally goofy buddies) gets into the school pretending to be a Dutch priest named Father Guus (get it?)! Throw in B-movie legend Linnea Quigley as a fellow student who takes a disliking to our heroine and plans to embarass her at a school dance. Nothing turns out as planned, of course. Don't expect Oscar-level acting or deep, shocking plot twists. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy a fine example of classic B-movie silliness!"
3,Robin Williams Design Workshop,This is a great reference for print design but the web site section is almost laughably outdated. Gone are the days of splash entry pages and HTML tables for non-conmplex layouts (now easily rendered by CSS). And who the heck is running 640x480 resolution on a 14 inch monitor these days??
5,Book: Robin Williams Design Workshop,"Robin Williams writes some of the most helpful books in the computer field. In clear and concise manner all of the books I have read of hers have been first-rate. Now, for this book and its necessary pre-requisite reading ""The Non-Designers Design Book,"" I have nothing but high praise. For the trained and experienced design professional this material is perhaps old hat but for those who, for whatever reason, must either design or critique graphic design projects these two books are: 1) quick reading, 2) full of useful, practical advice and suggestions. I guarantee the way you look at graphic design will be changed by these two volumes."
4,Great Breakdown,I bought this book for class. This book is a great introduction into design and covers a lot of ground. The way it shows a before and after progression of different designs makes it easy to perceive design concepts in a easily digestible format.
5,Great ideas and an easy-read book!,"I had to buy this book for a design class in college and now that I am out of college, I still use it for ideas on projects and inspiration. Robin writes in a very easy to understand language and gives you lots and lots of pictures to illustrate what she is saying... the WHOLE book is full of colored photos! I liked this book so much, I decided to purchase Robin Williams Web Design Workshop."
3,Outdated but can provide inspiration,"Interesting book, could give you some ideas for improving design. But I find that it's outdated and not as modern as I would've hoped."
2,Only for beginners,"This book was used as the textbook for a class I took. I was very dissappointed. The info was from first year design classes, and there were even suggestions given that are common ""no-no's"" in graphic design. It had several interpretations of each design problem, which was interesting to look at, but nothing too inspirational."
1,not very helpful,"I didn't like it and it didn't help me. I was looking for a tutorial, but this book is more like an overview of web design."
4,Robin Williams Design Workshop,"I learned about this book at a recent seminar. Bought it here through Amazon. Was a little worried when I read the first chapter that it would be over my head because I am a total novice, but I soon found myself engrossed in the book. It really is very helpful and the repeatition of ideas and ""rules"" helps drive home the important stuff. Well laid out so you can skip the chapters that don't interest you. Although I would consider reading them. I found that certain ideas hit home better in some chapters than others and I think it has helped my overall design ability. Good Book especially for those of us who love how-to books."
5,Buy it!,This book has been on my To-Buy list for sometime now and i was really glad to start using it. Robin explains everything that is important about web design. The Quizzes are really neat and the examples are real-world as can be. This is a must-buy for beginners and an excellent reference for experienced desktop publishers.
5,Superb Assistant,"Once again, Robin Williams has produced a superb book that will assist those who are struggling to create communications that work. Buy this book. It is exceptionally useful."
4,A Worthwhile Workshop,"Not as compelling as her Non-Designers Design Book, but useful and inspiring nonetheless. I find this book useful when trying to solve design problems in my own business.Joe Okonkwowww.ZootCreative.com"
3,Somewhat outdated for today,"This book has all the simple elements for designers to start designing, but is somewhat outdated for pro or advanced designers. Not very visually appealing in Kindle format on iPad. Feels very scattered. Printed version looks a bit better."
5,Very helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful and easy to understand. Examples of what to do and what not to do are very clear and provide many ""aha"" moments when you realize how much better a piece can look by following the tips/suggestions in the book. Essential reference book for any graphic designer from beginner to advance."
1,Repeat of the 2001 book,"I was so disappointed. Ninety percent of this ""2007 second edition"" is verbatim of the book printed in 2001. The section on web design is a little different, and the designer's section in the back is different, but other than that, it's identical to the last book. They should have kept the COVER the same, and labeled it ""second edition"" so you knew it had already been published. I feel like I got ripped off! I thought I was getting new ideas and new art - but the pages are IDENTICAL to the last one."
5,Great book for any one interested in boxers.,"This book is great for all levels of interest in the breed of the Boxer dog. My Parents and I have bred and shown Bea-Mar-Ton's Boxers since 1953 and the book is full of information that interests me. It is a powerhouse of beautiful pictures of great boxers from the past as well as from the present. This book has a wealth of information that will enlighten anyone from someone thinking of owning a Boxer,to the pet Boxer owner, and even those who breed and show Boxers."
5,"no, ""a"" lord snowden.","I'm glad someone is at least thinking of the possibility of getting this film out on any format. I hadn't seen it in 30 years until I noticed it was playing on TMC last month, once, and I signed up with the cable company just so I could tape this rare gem.Richard Lester is associated with a number of interesting projects (the Beatles of course, and the brilliant Petulia, also still not out on DVD) but nothing this intensely insane and totally wild, probably because its hard to think of any movie ever this idiocynchratically perfect.A couple of years after a nuclear attack, a couple dozen Londoners continue to carry on with the british way of life, amidst the ruins and mutations. Written by Spike Milligan, it is entirely an ensemble piece featuring the likes of Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Marty Feldman, Ralph Richardson and Lester fave, Rita Tushingham.Very much of its time, bold and dark. Not a bad companion piece to Strangelove. Difficult to find, and well worth the effort."
5,A truly remarkable biography of a seeker of God,"Madame Guyon had a strong Catholic background. As such, she sometimes used or rather misused the statue of Jesus. She also did not have as clear a view of the church as some of us do today.However, don't let her background hold you back from taking a closer look at her life. You will find her character, prayer life, trials and dealing with the self so outstanding and striking that they speak to you with great immediacy. Her spiritual experience is way advanced compared to her Catholic contemporaries. Hers was a reaction to the deadness of religion during her time.The words of this woman of faith will force you to re-examine your life in the context of your relationship with and devotion to God.Furthermore, the writing is swift, moving and true. The line of thought flows unhindered and appeals both to soul and spirit.This is surely one of the best biographies I've read and I absolutely recommend it to any reader."
2,Maybe was helpful pre-economic collapse...,"I noticed most of the 4 and 5 star reviews were written when the 2004 hard-cover came out. In 2011, life's a LOT different. I (and millions of others) have no job, no prospects. Pop psych books like this were ok when ""job burnout"" was all the rage. But what about the anger manifesting itself in Occupy Wall Street and civil disobedience? Dr. Jones might find herself over her head in today's rage."
1,CAP Ripoff,Overpriced short book with decent references. Overall weak in subject depth - cursory and did I mentioned way overpriced. It's obscene to charge $60 for a superficial paperback that's required for coursework.Disappointing
5,i received *4* discs!,i'm not sure if i received an older or newer version of this from amazon but my case contains all four movies on their own separate disc.the video quality is pretty great for DVD & it's absolutely worth buying this set over the individual movies.
3,4 Film Favorites (Critters/Critters 2/Critters 3/Critters 4),"Critters and Critters 2 are the same old alien invasion stuff, but the critters are horribly cute and sometimes funny--but Critters 3 and Critters 4--enough already."
3,4 disc set in box for single,"This is a set of 4 movies, but the case is made for 1 disc and they all just stack on top of each other."
3,Fun Combo Pack,"I forgot how cheesy these movies were because I only saw part of them when I was a kid. The 3rd & 4th movies sucked, don't waste your time. Overall the 1 & 2nd movies were ok, its lame all of them are only Pg 13."
3,4 Film Favorites Critters Collection,"I considered this DVD purely as a guilty pleasure. A poor man's Gremlins, but a real value for these 4 ultracamp films from the creature era of the eightys. Get it and have some retro-fun."
3,Liberal views on American strategy,"Nye provides very good descriptions on current affairs... His main point is that American power rests on three realm - military, economic, and cultural. The ""soft-power"" that Nye designates American cultural power seem to be bit far-fetched argument. Of course the world is changing but the culture, norms, and institutions developing currently have little policy implications for international affairs. Rather they reflect new forms of cultural & institutional hegemony framed and applied by self-serving realists."
3,Disappointing,"Very cut and dry, and at times very boring. Nye uses so many quotes that you start to wonder whether he has any ideas of his own. There also seem to be superfluous references to September 11th that seem to be thrown in just for the hell of it. But I'm no critic -- if you're not looking for an exciting read, give it a shot."
3,Nice work,"I'd go along with another review that this book seemed to be compiled rather hastily...a lot of generalizations on America, very broad statements on the world's current state, numerous non-specific arguments on the steps America needs to take next.But being general certainly doesn't make it worthless. The text seems like a good introduction to various facets of the world in 2002...but probably not much in the way of originality if you keep up with the news and think for a bit about what you see/read."
2,Soft Power is Only Influence,"Joseph Nye is brilliant, but completely off with his theory that there is any such thing as ""soft power"" beyond mere influence. He makes a case that so-called soft power, which comes from cultural exports and good will, are comparable to hard power (as expressed in terms of the capacity for military or economic coercion) in terms of accomplishing a nation's (specifically, America's) objectives on the world stage. What he's done, though, is merely to elevate influence based on popularity to the level of actionable power, which is totally wrong. Look at the entire history of bilateral relations between any two friendly nations, and you will see that over and over again, accomodation was made when it was in the interest of both states, or when one had the hard power to coerce the other to go along. No nation ever acts in the interest of another just because they like that other country's pop music and blue jeans!"
2,Stupid book,This is a stupid book. Its premises do not work. I pitty Harvard for wrong-headed teaching...
2,It kept reminding me of....,"When I got this book I thought that I would be experiencing a new, hot author; however with ever page that I turned I kept getting flashbacks of Laurell K. Hamilton. If you are an avid Hamilton fan, stay away from this one, I think that you will be disappointed, if you have never read her work, you will probably enjoy this book. It could be a good way to warm up to the Anita Blake series."
1,Do not waste your money,This is the most expensive piece of trash I have ever owned. It does not roll at all on bare carpet or floors. Please do not waste your money.
5,Brilliant,"A terrific book of ""general principles"" that anyone of practically any theoretical orientation will likely find useful. Incomprehensibly and inexplicably underrated. The theory is based on very sound principles of behavior and simply extends them to include times when we are not aware of what we are doing and why, and are also unaware of what might be rewarding about even our negative behaviors. It makes sense, because in many cases humans can be subject to reinforcement (reward) and punishment without full awareness. It gets really interesting when the interaction of two persons, each of whom is always ""pulling"" for a certain response from the other, interact. I won't give the rest away, as it's too much of a pleasure to read. It's a must-have for therapists who do more than just ""band aid"" therapy."
4,good elbow,Its an elbow..what can you say...but really its clean no stray platic...was slightly undersized so i had to wrap a bit of duct tape around it to tighten the seal so I knocked a star off for that
3,Its an elbow,"Hose to hose fitting which is a dumb thing rarely needed but hooked to another fitting to change a fixed direction is. Buy the coupling for it, probably two."
1,Disappointed,"This is not useful as it is not an adapter with a large and small end, and therefore will not connect to a saw vent. Both ends are the same size. It cost $5 and $5.43 for shipping."
3,solder,It is just a spool of solder. What kind of a review does that require?If you want one then buy it.
2,There are so many better Pete Seeger albums.,This is a poorly recorded and unprocessed release. The album gives a disclaimer we have heard before- processing will take away from the total sound experience. Translation: We can't afford the equipment to bring this cheezy recording up to even minimal standards. It sounds like it was taken directly off a 78 rpm. Pete's performances do not deserve this kind of marginal treatment. MG
5,The Material gets Five Stars... The Quality of the Artist (Pete Seeger) Is Never In Doubt!,"The songs on this CD are all great, and Pete is at his usual best. I would like to address something brought up by the previous reviewer tho. Although the sound quality is not up to today's standards, it is a great CD nonetheless, and just because something was recorded prior to the dawn of High Fidelity recording, does not mean that it does not merit being preserved on CD. I would advise those who expect excellent sound quality to steer clear of any recordings made prior to 1950."
2,Works but at this price?,This downdraft table is poorly constructed with poor materials. The sides and bottom is of MDF board with rather crude joints -- one of the corner joints came apart during shipment. I had to glue it back together. The top is just a piece of peg board that sits on rabbets of the side panels. You have to put a piece of non-slip material (very wrinkled from the shipment) on top of the peg board. The peg board falls out everytime I move the table (heavy because of the MDF boards) since the peg board is not fastened to the base in anyway. The dust collector connector just pushes into a hole in the base. The whole table costs about $12 in material to make. To charge so much for such low quality in both material and workmanship is ridiculous!
2,"Great idea, lousy construction","My neighbor bought one of these tables as his shop is actually in a spare bedroom. It arrived in sad shape, two of the corners had come apart and we had to glue and clamp it back together. It works ok but is pretty heavy and as mentioned before the top is not fastened to the carcass. This problem was easily fixed with some glue and screws. Don't know where the idea of the cloth screen came from, it just clogs up and hampers the vac's performance. It works ok now, but I think I will build my own. I think I can build one for the cost of shipping this one."
5,AWESOME MAP!,"This map is fascinating, durable & made to last! Beautifully designed and perfect for curious minds. I'd recommend it to everyone and it arrived in perfect condition."
5,Excellent Magical Text,"Cavendish is an illumined black magician, devoid of sentimentality and fear-born delusiveness, full of fruitful insight into the historical psychology and meaning of esotericism. Highly recommend to all aspiring reality-explorers. (Except for the innumerable hordes of trendy blind egocentric satanists and other abusive poseurs who would do better to hang themselves instead of justifying their beclouded, neurotic weakness by invoking the potency of esoteric knowledge.) ""The Black Arts"" reveals man's interaction with the chaotic tendencies inherent in the cosmos and his task of positively mastering it."
4,Dirty fun,"After reading this book, I really wanted to grab a shovel and head out for the nearest cemetery. Vivid images flashed through my mind as I read his detailed descriptions of spells. A necromancer I'm not, but if given the opportunity to experience the living dead, I'd take it. Much of what Cavendish writes about just couldn't be a reality for me. I mean, where can you actually go digging for six feet(it would take me several hours), perform a spell, and not get caught by the caretaker or the police or somebody? His book was well-written and I liked the way he discussed several different topics and broke them down by chapter. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in black magic or anyone who just wants to get spooked. What's the penalty for exhuming a corpse anyway? It would be well worth the risk for the knowledge attained from a successful spell."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up this book at a local bookstore at the urging of a friend, and quite honestly, I found it a waste of my hard-earned money.While he spends a great deal of time discussing alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone, I find his tendency to group all witches into the 'Satanic' category irksome, and the fact that he speaks so much about petitioning to God and to the angels is not what I wanted from a book on 'The Black Arts'. Quite clearly, the author considered all magick to be black ... well, it's not.From now on, I'll stick to works by Simon, Crowley, and Ford."
3,hmmmm interesting,"i just finished reading this book and i must say that it had kept me quite occuppied during my alone time in summer school. Though some of the text is hard to understand (i kept getting the feeling that this author was only trying to impress me with a very confusing writing style)it is quite informative, and since i have been studying wicca for quite some time now i can't help but question the facts. It seems that he is more trying to ""convert"" you than try to inform you, for example...the way he describes numerology, and though the examples are intersting it seems that he is more trying to convince you by throwing examples in your face. All I have to say is I advise you not to choose this book if it is your frist time learning about the craft...you'll only get the wrong idea...I suggest The Wiccan Bible, it dissects everything until you totally understand it...the dos and don'ts. Best of all the author has nothing to prove."
4,More fun than you should be allowed to have,"This is one of the best-written, most lucid accounts of black magic that I've read, and believe me, I've read a lot of them. I don't care if Cavendish believes a word of it, his review of what's what is fun.Usually, the sceptics are too busy de-bunking, and the believers too busy being credulous, so the whole subject ends up being tedious. Unless, of course, you are determined to try some magic yourself, in which case, you will need all the credulity you can muster. Cavendish treats it all with a light hand, and gives a nice overview of the subject.Have fun. Read this before you plunge into the study of the occult - it'll save you a lot of floundering around."
2,Lukewarm,"Cavendish's book is interesting insofar as it comes from an unusual perspective for those writing about the so-called Black Arts. His Christian bias is obvious, and nearly all examples he gives are shown through a Christian filter, but--unlike so many others--he isn't preachy. He doesn't condemn or support any of the practices within the book--this isn't a how-to guide or a religious tract, after all--despite his constant returns to the subejct of devil- or demon-worship. The quality of writing is fair and stays reasonably engaging throughout. The chief failing of this book--aside from the bias and emphasis on demon-worship--is his attempt to cover so much material in so little space. The chapter on the Kabbalah is particularly confused and rushed. He brushes past a great number of important details and doesn't always elaborate on his own discussions enough for the reader to pick up on the key details necessary for understanding."
5,great quality,i have done quality assurance work for many years. now i am happily retired. but i am very particular about the quality of anything i buy. way too picky actually. i can't find anything to complain about in this ring. it is beautifully done. the ring is larger than i thought from the picture but that's a good thing. it looks great on my finger. i am very pleased with all my purchases from gem avenue. no one will think you paid so little for this ring either.
4,Glad I bought this !,"Bought this new for around five bucks on the internet, Sounds good and typical Naxos budget quality. Great cd to put on and listen to in the background while I work. Sounds a bit like Vivaldi. Good violin sound with feeling. Well rehearsed and tight.Geminiani studied under Scarlatti and Corelli, so if you like their music you should be pleased with this. I am.Good day !"
4,I really enjoyed this!,"It is hard to review the whole book when it is made up of 4 different short stories. I enjoyed them all, some better than others, but overall very enjoyable."
3,I only liked one story in here...,"And that's why I bought it. ""Catch a Falling Star"" is by far the best one and that's why I purchased the book in the first place. I didn't really like all the other three stories. The only con about ""Catch a Falling Star"" is that it's TOO short. That means I want more, MorE, MORE!!! But kinda figures since I knew it was an anthology and all the stories are bound to be short. Dang it!I'm a sucker for stories like how everyone thinks of this guy as an ""ass"" but he's not really how everyone perceives him...kinda like Mr. Darcy;-P Sure proves how wrong everyone is and how the guy is sooooo sweet...(sigh)"
5,Wonderful collection of stories,"I had already read the Nora Roberts Spellbound in another book, but the additional stories were absolutely wonderful. I am glad I bought the book. Now I want all of the Once Upon books!"
5,My first book by Nora Roberts,"I just bought this book yesturday, i wanted to buy the first one,buy the book store was out so i bought the 2nd one. i have heard that her books are very good. exspecialy if you like romance novles which i do. this will be the first book to read of hers but i have heard great things about her books and i love stories thats deal with love,spells,enchantment,and happy ever-afters. its like they seem to take you away form reality for a while, kinda like a vacation. i mean where else can you get your very own get away and not go anywhere for under 20$?....only in a book. im sure i will be pleased with this book,im planning on buying the other 2 in this series and many more of Nore Robert's books."
3,Everyday Asian,Good detailed recipes but no pictures to go along with each recipe. Pictures help with how the dish should look when presented.
2,Can't rate because it arrived broken into pieces,"Clearly it wasn't engineered well enough to handle being shipped (or wasn't packaged or packed well enough), so even if it was good at its job, imagine dropping it onto your workbench... Not much good after that either. Might be worthwhile if you epoxy it to a block of wood along one edge. Provided it arrives in one piece, that is."
1,I can't believe I paid $1.99 to rent this...,"I was so bored, I spent about 30 minutes of the movie trying to decide whether I should play with the cat or use the background noise to get me through doing preliminary taxes. In the end, it was excellent for clipping my nails and sorting through junk mail. Most of the movie was made up from deleted scenes from House on Haunted Hill and Orphan. I got the message loud and clear though; ""Abandon your autistic daughter in the parking lot of a mental institution to make the demons stop."" This is the kind of movie that encourages the Susan Smiths of the world. I'm gonna recommend this movie to Patti so she'll be mad at me. Excellent payback for the bathroom prank."
3,Good Lord,"First of all, the little girl must have been related to the Director, nuf said. The monsters were pretty cool, however the ending was plain goofy. One thumb up and one in the bands behind."
2,"It's everything you've heard, and worse.","Had Dark Floors not featured the members of the band Lordi, it would have gotten completely lost in the flood of Ghost House Underground releases. As a whole Floors is no different than any horror movie you've seen. It's completely unmemorable, it has all of the expected cliches, and it has an incomprehensible ending. The point of all of these psychological horror films (Where I'd classify this) is to end with a twist that doesn't leave room for any explanation. I'd rather this type of movie end with a bang rather than a tired twist ending. Though having Lordi maintain their costumes for this film is a novel idea, they brought nothing to the film. It could have been anyone else in their shoes, and you wouldn't have noticed or cared. Thanks to them though, more people will see this than normally would have, and that's too bad. I'd recommendJack Brooks: Monster Slayerover this one, because throwback monsters are done better there, AND they fit the story."
4,"Solid, consistent horror","I enjoyed this movie enough to buy it, and have watched it several times. It is creepy and, thankfully, internally consistent. The things that happen in the movie fit in the framework created, which is more than you can say for a lot of other horror!The characters are mostly one-note: the nurse is concerned, dad is a brave defender of his daughter, the businessman is self-interested and obnoxious. The actors hit those notes well.The monsters are well-done, and there are several genuinely scary moments in the movie. You know when you hit the climax, and that's when things shift. I like the ending, where resolution is implied rather than stated. You'll know what I mean after you see the movie.It's not ground-breaking, but it is good, solid, scary fun."
4,LONG LIVE LORDI,"Though the movie is hard to follow, (Spoiler Alert: Each floor is like a time flux and if you watch each floor on a different screen at the same time, you will see they are in sync.) it is a good movie and with LORDI in it, they make it a 4-star film instead of 2. P.S. Awesome song during the end credits."
4,"Good Special Effects, Decent Story","I need to review this one for you because usually these horror-series sponsored movies are pretty awful, however this one was pretty good! The special effects exceeded my expectations by a long shot, and it looked really cool on a nice TV. The plot line though ridiculed by some is actually good and although quite a bit is left to the imagination enough of the story is tied up at the end to safsify viewers. Rent this one, buy it if you are a huge horror fan."
1,So not worth the 5$s I paid,"When I went to buy this movie by reading what it was about seemed like it might be a kool movie. Plus I usually like the lionsgate horror movies, but this movie just sucked.The begining makes it seem like its going to be good by what is going on, but soon it just drags on and goes on and on and is not really entertaining, scary or anything at all.I would so not buy this if I was you."
4,Okay movie; Excellent dvd,"While not one of the better Doris Day films, ""The Ballad of Josie"" does have a wonderful feminist streak that is refreshing. This made-on-demand dvd is surprisingly excellent. The anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) tranfer is crystal clear and without a single blemish on the print. The mono sound is equally strong and clear as well. I didn't have great hopes for the audio-video quality of this MOD dvd, but was thrilled to find how strong it was. Fans of Doris and/or the film should be VERY satisfied. Now hopefully Universal will at last release Doris' ""Midnight Lace"" as well."
4,The Ballad of Josie,"Not offten you see a comical western. this movie is a good laugh at the struggle western men anda western woman, who will not submit to their thinking. So, they have to submit to hers."
5,Great Gift!,I have searched for years for this movie for my dad. When I found it I was so excited. My dad actually had tears in his eyes when I gave it to him at Christmans because he also had been searching for it. This is one of those shows that you could watch over and over. Love the old westerns.
4,Josie review,"Great movie, reminded me of Sheepman (Glenn Ford/Shirley McLaine)a bit. A bit slow at the start but she finally nailed her man, well supported by Peter Graves."
2,Out of Sync,Not sure if it was only our dvd (this is the Universal Vault release from Amazon) as no one else has mentioned this but we have sent our dvd back. The soundtrack was so out of sync with the actors mouth movements we could not watch it. After about 20 minutes of no improvement we gave up and have sent it back to Amazon as defective.Very disappointed.
5,Great price on hard to find parts,Hard to find part which only fits Chevy Prizm and doesn't interchange with Corolla twin at way cheaper price than GM dealer made by Delphi. Worked for me!
4,Best for Indexing Felt Set,"I love the indexing in this manual that makes it easy to find the numbered felt pieces that go with each story. I prefer, however, to use the actual Bible accounts as the story source. I don't like the editorial nature of the stories in the book. I give it a 4 for the indexing alone, since the felt set is so huge!"
5,This was featured in a video game as well.,"These piece of work was Featured in cyberdreams video game ""Darkseed"" and Darkseed II she is well basically the protagonist against the antagonist's ""the ancients"" she chooses a human named Mike Dawson to save his world and her's and well earth and the world within his mirror ""The Dark World"" is the equivellant of earth. The dark world is basically a evil side scrolling layer of H.R. Gigers work this is a really beautiful yet disturbing piece I wouldn't mind hanging on my wall."
5,My first poem I have written is in this book.,"The first poem I have ever won an award for is in this book. It is in honor of my Father which is entitled ""Thank You Daddy"". It was an honor for the International Poets Society to select ME to have this poem published. For any new peot out there,poetry.com is a wonderful place to go. I have read many poems in this book and they are wonderful. For any poet, it is a great book and for those that are not, it is a heartwarming book to read with the biographies of some of the authors in the back of the book."
5,Best Book Ever,"For several years, I have felt my body deteriorating in so many ways; joint pain, fatigue, digestion problems, skin problems, on and on. I have been on the type O diet for 3 weeks and IT WORKS for me. I am recommending this book to people I care about because my chronic health issues are vastly improving. Why in the world would you try anything else first....pills? Try this diet. No gimics. It's not a weight loss book so much as it is a guide to healthy eating, designed just for you."
5,Made a difference,"I am an A+ so needed to cut down on meat. For years I have noticed I do much better with less meat,but now I know why. I am gradually modifying my diet and can really tell in my digestive tract."
5,Eat Right 4 Your Type,"I have learned from this book that not only everyone is not the same when it comes to eating, I also learned that everything you eat does not agree with your body chemistry and in order to live a longer and healthy life, one must eat the foods that are beneficial to them. In other words, what is good for the goose might not be good for the gander."
4,Good readin',"Very informative book........arrived quickly and in very good condition. Thank you once again, Amazon for coming thru with quality!!"
1,Where is the evidence?,"When I first saw this book, it really got my attention. The concept that we should eat according to our blood type because this is what our ancestors did is both new to me and intriguing. However, being a man of science and facts, I decided to do some research before subjecting myself to these dietary recommendations. Sad to say, Dr. D'Adamo's books and website are full of stories about how people lost weight or became healthier after undergoing his dietary recommendations. I did not find any shred of scientific evidence that the system as a whole works. Where is the double-blind randomized controlled trial that proves this system works? Where are the follow up studies? Shouldn't anything like this be published in a peer-reviewed journal? Stories and testimonies about how effective this diet is IS NOT science."
4,Great book,I had read this book before; it is very easy to read and it makes sense to me from a medical and scientific perspective. I had my own copy; but have loaned it out to several friends and co workers. It was time I ordered another copy. The copy I ordered was in nearly perfect condition.
5,eat right for your blood type,Great book. Great resource. Book has been popular for a long time. Great to pick up a couple of used books for a vaction and recreational reading.
3,Not realistic,"My husband is type O and has gout which flares up periodically. The suggested foods for his blood type are contradictary to suggested foods to avoid gout flare ups. I am AB and cannot stand most seafood as it causes stomach distress for me, and fish is strongly recommended for my blood type. Basically, this did not give us any realistic answers, but it was an interesting read."
1,For those who are desperate for an answer,This book was fun to read. But it's no different from any other 'diet' books that saturate our culture. It's another book that feeds on people's desperation to get an answer from an outside source instead of relying on their natural common sense. It's pretty obvious to me that anyone will feel better and lose weight if they eliminate sugar and refined foods from their diet. I have no doubet that this works but it makes food such a focus in one's life. A bit too obsessive.
3,Only started reading - Sample of races is limited ?,"I just started reading the book, so there is a lot of info I have not gone through.It appears convincing and well structured. One caveat with the book is that the number of races they used in their studies seems limited. However, I understand that this is probably because of the availability of patients, limitations of the studies at the time it was done. Maybe it does not matter, it is only something I noticed. It'd be interested to see if the suggestions for a specific diet hold up for other races."
5,"The style and content are OK, the results are GREAT!","My personal opinion is that I would have liked more facts to back up each of the food recommendations, but then others probably would feel that would make the book too detailed. The final test is how well the applied theory works, and I can attest to the fact it works extremely well. I have lost weight without trying, have more energy, and clearer skin after only a few months on it. I am a convert for life!"
3,eat right 4 your type,"Interesting reading, I'm still working on it. My O.B.G.Y.N. Doctor read it, she said it was a good read."
3,FABULOUSE BOOK!!!!!,"I'm only giving this book three stars because I'm saving the other stars for ""Cook Right for Your Type"" and ""Live Right for Your Type""! It is so marvelous not to have to think about my food choices anymore! I just eat right for my type and I'm feeling GREAT!I so agree with the Purdue graduate too. Why let science get in the way? Phooey on the scientific method! Give me Doctor Peter's words instead! Just look at the testimonials on this website alone. Over 150 people have been helped and a couple meanies try to spoil everything by saying that it isn't good science!I don't even have a bachelor's of science degree but just like Doctor Peter D'Adamo, I sure know what works! Eating and cooking and living right for your type, that's what!Every popular author has to put up with critics. Remember what they used to say about Jacqueline Suzanne? I say ""keep up the good work, Doctor Peter"" and don't ever listen to anyone who disagrees with you. They're always...WRONG FOR YOUR TYPE!"
2,Eat Right 4 Your Type by Peter J. D'Adamo,"I bought this book thinking it was scientifically accurate only to be told by my naturopath/homeopath who has a bachelor of health science degree that he has read this book from cover to cover and that this book has no basis in fact, i am confused whodo these writers think they are misleading the public just to make a dollar.For example he says that B bloodgroups should not eat wheat if they want to lose weight and to eat spelt ar rice bread instead,well i did this but because these are carbohydrates as well theyhad the same effect on not being able to lose weight, he also says we should eat meat but meat gives me hives on my face and produces an acid state in the body and to anyone who has cancer which i don't, it is the worst thing you can eat as the body needs to have alkaline and not acid producing foods.Will somebody wright a book based on fact please! .My cousin Chris helped me with this review."
1,This book is garbage,"It's too bad there isn't a choice of ""no stars"" to review books here, that is the rating this book merits. It's unfortunate to see so many people getting sucked into a diet fad that is based on no documented research, merely speculation of a naturopathic doctor with highly questionable academic credentials. The theory is nonsense, and ""Dr."" D'Adamo must change it regularly as additional actual scientific evidence emerges further proving his theories are bunk.Avoid this book if you are concerned about your health. It is pure fantasy."
3,Eat right for your type,"Get it from your public library! It's an ""interesting"" book but you can read it in 2-3 days. No need to spend money on it..."
3,Hard time believing it.......,"My Sister swears by it, but I have heard many other specialist say there is no basis for the claims made.... who knows....?"
5,Great,The seller was great with shipping and the product was in great shape. I also enjoyed the book very much. It did say alot to me about what was going on in my body.
4,Life changing,I have suffered from IBS symptoms for years and could never pinpoint what was actually causing it...until I read this book. This has been life changing for me. Thanks Peter D'Adamo I wish I had have read it years ago!!
5,The skeptics haven't even tried it!,"You'll notice in the following posts that the people who give this book 1 star haven't even tried the plan! Incredible! The proofs in the doing folks, get a clue! I'm a total skeptic UNTIL I can prove something to myself, and after 5 months on the plan my doc tells me I'm in the best shape ever. Can't wait for his Live Right for your Type due out in January!!!"
5,Great Read!,"I love this book! Finally, a ""diet"" book that truly is about health and eating and not about depriving oneself and forcing oneself to fit into an eating plan that doesn't fit. I have been dealing with having ovarian cancer for over two years, and eating the foods Dr. D'Adamo recommends for my blood type (""O""), is making me feel much better. Although the Type O diet is not the current wisdom for cancer patients, the proof is in the pudding, so to speak. While I'm not claiming that this will cure my cancer by any means, anything that will help me to feel better is great. Also, for Type Os, the Low Carb Cookbook, available through Amazon, has great recipes for us."
1,I fell for it at first,then I read one line that just kept resounding in my mind. The line stated that if I followed the diet for my blood type I would have to take a supplement to get enough calcium. If this is the perfect diet for my type then why doesn't it have enough calcium for my body? It just doesn't compute.
5,Excellent,"This worked for me, I lost 25kg using this theory.Plus increased my feeling of well being and energy.Give it a go!"
3,The information presented was highly intriguing . . .,"Although it was intriguing it was radically incomplete. When they say ""abridged"" it should be taken as a ""red flag"" warning. In the tapes, she only covers the Type O and roughly the Type AB deliniations. But, she (the narrator) presented a great introduction to the subject. I am considering purchasing the book now. I looked it over carefully at a local bookstore and it has a diet for Type B's carefully outlined, with explanations. I'm sorry I didn't just pick up the book in the first place!"
3,this diet is not for those on a budget,"this book is very helpful explaining why some diets work for some people but, not others. i know one person who can eat big macs with impunity; but this person's sibling eats the same way and the same amount and is overweight. the former is a type o; the latter type a. many people would like to try the blood type diet. what the author recommends is unrealistically expensive. example: spelt bread $5.00, almond butter $7.69. i am a mom with two kids and a limited budget.(both kids have two different completely blood types) this book would be helpful if it had an addendum, say, blood type diets on a budget. thanks. i hope readers out there have ideas."
4,Change your life for the better!,"I was talked into being a vegetarian over 30 years ago by my OB/GYN because of the problems I was having staying pregnant. Eight (?) years ago, I discovered why it worked so well for me: because my blood type is A+. I have been following this diet since I became aware of it, and I recommend it highly!! The only thing I DON'T agree with is the nutritionist's insistence on supplementing a vegetarian diet with soy protein. Soy makes great ink but is not a good FOOD - for any living beings - in my opinion: too much protein and very hard to digest (unless it's turned into tofu or tempeh). Everything else in the book is right on, however!! Excellent information - will keep you healthy and happy!"
3,Why is it that the Type O's get the best results?,"It seems that most of the people in the case studies that had good results were the Type O's. Well, I am a type A and this didn't work for me at all. I followed it to the T and ended making myself a basket case. My triglycerides shot up and my HDL went down. My blood pressure skyrocketed and I felt like the world was going to cave in on me. I have followed a low carbohydrate version for the Type A and am doing much better. I eat chicken and turkey most of the time and I have cut out dairy. Now all my levels are normal. It just goes to show that this diet doesn't work for everyone."
1,I am not a believer.,"I tried to follow the diet prescribed in this book for my blood type, thinking it will make me feel better and that I will lose weight. I did neither. Also, the were so many foods to ""avoid"" that I felt like I would have been better served by a ""fasting"" diet. Check the book out at the library and see if it works before investing money. It may not be worth it."
4,Eat Right 4 your type,"I ordered this book on the recommendation of a friend. Whether or not you are going to follow the diet for your blood type to a T or not, the book is very interesting. The book is just a guideline for eating properly for your type."
3,A very good basic reference,"There are far too many omissions in my opinion. For example, the spice Oregano (how much more common a spice can there be) is not listed in the spice sections of the book so a person has no clue whether it is beneficial for their particular blood type or not. Also Pollock, which immo crab meat is made from, is not listed. These type of omissions are irritating. I do enjoy the book as a basic reference, however and have personally benefited from using it."
4,teether,son loved it it got here very fast and is his new favorite teether wish it didn't squeak though but my older son gets a kick out of that
4,Great Book,This book was in excellent condition for a used book. I really like the book for reference on what I should and should not eat for my blood type. It is so interesting to learn about blood types and how they originated.I also want to report that ordering from Amazon is so convenient and always a pleasure to do business with as you can track your purchases from the day you send in your order.
4,Eat Right 4 Your Type,This book was very informative. Easy to get through quickly with lots of great tables and menus. Would recommend to anyone looking to try a new or different approach to dieting.
3,Medical Miracle,"So simple and so effective. After a whole load of wrong diets this book was pure gold and the results are so impressive that you really wonder why these informations are not known by the big public. Money?After a few years passed by I'd have to say that this book is Ok to start with and take care of what you eat, but unfortunately this isn't the end of the show. Other books about diet and detox will offer a broader perspective on this science, and there's still so much 'work in progress' that it's better not to loose track of all the new discoveries in this field."
2,As skeptical as the next...,"I am a Type B and Dr. D'Adamo tells me to eat more dairy. I have never been able to digest any dairy products of any kind and he's telling me to eat them. I have IBS and if I even dare to eat dairy then I am sick all day long. What he says, I should be a Type AB then.I agree with other reviewers, don't eat fast foods, soda or junk foods and eat healthy nutritious meals with exercise and you'll lose weight."
2,Doesn't work as a cassette for refering to your type later.,"I didn't like it in this format because this is a book that you need to refer to often after you read it. Because it is on cassette, you can't just open it to the list of do's and don'ts for type O. You need to listen to the entire tape to get the information and there is no way to highlight the information you will need later."
2,Eat right for your blood type,"You really do not need the larger book if you just want to try the diet.The smaller ones for each individual blood type gives you all you need to know about what to eat and not to eat. However, the larger book does trace the diet and how it was accomplished. Found it interesting. Am going to give it a try!!"
1,"Honestly, read some science and talk to your doctor!!","My guess is those of you that are singing the praises of this book and are calling it your saviour are people who weren't on balanced diets to begin with and with this book you started actually watching what you ate and kept things to moderation. And by some miracle the diet actually coincided with your metabolism and made you feel better or lose weight or whatever. The theory is bogus. It has to be. There are so many other proteins on a red blood cell besides just the one that determines type. Basing a diet off of your blood type is just ridiculous. Here's an idea, talk to your doctor, check out the food pyramid and get some exercise once in a while and stop eatting fast food. Moderation, moderation, moderation. Yes, you can have a piece of cake, just not the whole cake in one sitting. But seriously, talk to your doctor, someone who knows how the body works, and get the diet that's right for you!"
4,Great despite the debate,"There has been a lot of debate on if there is any merit in this diet. Many say there is a lack of research supporting the claims, but after reading about my blood type I thought it made a lot of sense. I do fit in with the major characteristics of my blood type. As with all diets, one does diet does not fit all. I found the natural medicine section particularly useful too. The book suggests not only good foods, but good medicines, and forms of exercise for your type."
2,Was not impressed,Was not impressed with this book. Friend recommended it to me and it was not something that held my attention. It was not very reader friendly to me. Had to jump from one place to another. Maybe readers that are more interested in the information will take time to pick thru and find what they need.
5,Relieving my pain,I love this book because it shows me how food effects the arthritis I have. I want to stop my arthritis pain so I will do the diet. It really seems to make sense.
5,fabulous book........,Lots of wonderful info and very easy to read and understand.Read it with an open mind and i think everyone can profit from it.
5,no-nonsense diet for health,"This book has helped many of my family members to reduce asthma, GERD, indigestion, food allergies, and irritable bowel."
2,Eat Right 4 Your Type,Buyer Beware: It might interest you to know that this is the 1996 edition and not the more recent 2002 edition.
5,Raves for Eat Right for Your Type,"I can not say enough in praise for the information provided in Eat Right 4 Your Type as it relates to how food affects each blood type. I started following Dr. D'Adamo's recommendations for health reasons. In just 4 months I am seeing about 90% - 100% reduction in health problems (fibromyalgia, edema, bloating, white hair returning to dark, birthmark disappearing, painful joints, etc) and have lost over 30 lbs. This is all with no sense of ""dieting"" or self-deprivation. It is very simple, just avoid the foods that are harmful and focus on the foods that are highlly beneficial for my type.The first 3 chapters contain easily understood nutritional information and explanation of how avoid foods affect our bodies. That's all I needed to read to see for myself the benefits of incorporating Dr. D'Adamo's recommendations into my way of living."
3,just good sense,The book lays out good health eating plans for anyone who wants to be healthy and loose weight. Seemed pretty straight forward to me.
4,Eat Right For Your Type,"I found this book and it's companion book, Cook Right For Your Type. I started reading it, and I just can't put it down. It makes so much sense. It explains the mysteries, such as why does one weight loss program work for one person and not for another. My husband and I are currently in the Quick Weight Loss program. It even explains to me why in this program, some days are better than others, because I have eaten foods that I am supposed to avoid. I am almost at my goal of wanting to have lost 15 pounds and when I have reached that goal, then our family is going to start this program. I am currently trying to combine the two philosophies. I do have one question though. How do you find out about foods that aren't listed in the book?"
2,What about multiple blood-type families?,My mother-in-law lives with us. She's type AB. My husband and kids are type A. My father & mother visit frequently. They are A & O. I am O. How am I supposed to plan meals that can encompass all of our food needs for our blood types. This is a bit unrealistic.
5,A definite buy for those serious about their health!,"I actually did not know what blood type I had until I read this book. After reading all of it I was pretty sure I was a type 'O'...and the GP confirmed this after a day or so! If you are serious about your health, and want to have a healthy diet planned out for you as an individual, this is the book for you! Forget all those fad diets, and promises of get-thin-quickly out there! This book keeps you healthy, lean, powerful, and in tip top mental and physical state."
2,Eat Right 4 Your Type,"I purchased a used book and I do not expect the book to be in excellent condition, but the book was written all over. It is very distracting to read.Disappointed to receive a book that was written all over and paid almost $11 for."
1,Did not like this book at all.,I did not care for this book at all. Anyone wishing to buy it from me or excange for a different book.
5,Answered Nagging Questions,"I follow Dr. Atkins low-carb way of eating and love the way most of my problems vanished. However, after my initial weight loss, I was stuck on not losing. After reading Dr. D'Adamo's book on blood types, I stopped eating the items on the avoid list for my blood type and I am losing from 1/2 pound to 1 pound a day and feeling much much better. This book is a MUST for people who are looking for solutions to their health problems."
5,I HAVE SOME MUCH ENERGY NOW . . .,"I tried this diet about 3.5 weeks ago after hearing about it from a friend - right away, my Type O body responded ! By cutting out wheat, especially Italian bread, I immediately lost 5 lbs ! Interestingly enough, my diverticulosis went into almost immediate remission, and I have had only 1 bout with it since, whereas before I would have attacks at least 3X a week - fantastic. I have now lost 13 lbs., am feeling very energetic instead of lethargic at about 4 p.m., and am finding lots of great things to eat. I try to adhere to it about 90 % of the time, and am hoping to lose 25 more lbs. by the Fall of '98. My friends at work are also following it, and are having very good results. . ."
5,Secrets to a long healthy live uncovered,"Dr. D'Adamo is definitely onto something here. Being 46 yrs old and struggling with subpar health and excessive weight i tried the book at the recommendation of my doctor. In Feb 1997 i weighted 190 and had BP of 145/95. I was on BP medicine and wanted off. Well now Im off. ER4YT is a fantastic book Ive lost 25lbs BP is 115/75 and I feel better than ever. Thhe book is straight forward and easy to follow. Of course theres the usual 100 pages where the Dr toots his own horn which have no benefit to the reader, but after that its all business. Lots of good recipes and general health info. He even tells the reader what vitamins and herbs to take for each type. This book is a must for everyone. Read it."
4,In defense of the author,I would like to state that the 7/6/97 review by NORRISS fails to mention that lactose intolerance is talked about in detail for blood type B (p. 152). The book is a good read for anyone striving to optimize their overall health and well-being
1,This is complete nonsense,"Does anyone really believe, that nature intended us to run around with a complicated long list of foods to avoid and what to eat according to our blood type ? It makes sense to avoid certain types of food like dairy and meat and to increase veggies and fruits. But such an arbritary list, different for each blood type is just humbug. I changed my diet a couple of years ago to a more common sense approach. I dramatically increased my fruit intake, especially eating a lot of oranges and bananas. My health has improved dramatically. And now this guy is telling me to avoid these foods? There is a law, that science is based on. It states that the least astonishing and simplest explanation for a given phenomenon is also the most likely. A mysterious list of foods to eat and avoid varying with blood type certainly does not qualify! When is the next guy coming along writing a book titled: Eat right for your zodiacal sign ?"
2,A different view on dieting,The book arrived in like new condition. This type of diet is not for very many people. Be sure to check with your medical professional before embarking on this.
3,NOt sure I have not receive the book yet.,I have not received my order yet/ I ordered on April 8 and now it is May 9 and I have not received it so it would be hard to review it.I have never waited this long for a purchase from Amazon.comI do not understand the delay.Pauline
1,Blood Type is insufficient,"The book came to my attention about three years ago and being an A+ I avoided beef and pork and ate chicken and turkey. The turkey and chicken made me very nauseous. As I result I studied the scientific literature and found that chicken and turkey is more indigestible than beef and pork. I now eat large amounts of beef and pork and love it and feel great after I have done it. So I did further research and found the benefits of raw foods, the cure for arthritis, heart disease, the secrets of anti-aging and cancer, I wrote a book and sent it to the publisher and they published it as ""Eat Right For Life"". Dr Raymond A. Schep. I joined the top rugby club (Belmont) in the USA and am now playing rugby at the age of 65 with strong aggressive hard hitting 25 year old champs. I would like to see Dr Adamo doing that!!Ray"
5,Better Health,"My general health was very good before reading this book, so when a friend recommended reading it, I was a bit skeptical; but after following the diet for my type for the past month, I have to admit that I have more energy and that I am happier and that I sleep better at night. It's well worth the price."
4,"May not help everyone, but it helped me","Sure, there are tons of fad diets. But the idea that everyone responds differently to different foods is not really a fad. The theory is fairly sound, and may provide further insight to childhood likes and dislikes regarding various food types. If you have acid refluct or other stomach ailments, this is far superior than perscription drugs that merely coat your GI tract. And the interesting side benefits, especially for those conspiracy theorists, is that you quickly learn, if you are AB, how much high frutose corn syrup American injest daily!If you are on a budget, the book costs about 3 bottles worth of Mylanta."
2,not for me,"This book is hard to digest for those who are critical readers. This author does NOT supply references to his accusations, instead stating ""research has found..."" or ""in some studies...""; I need to know where you are supplying your information and not just make blanket statements."
5,Going to give it a try...,"I've been trying to optimize my diet for years and I think the theories put forth by Dr. D'Adamo may be plausible. I have to say that I found some of the negative reviews of the book to be worthless to me because they didn't actually address what's in the book! One mentions saving your money and following a generic diet of fruits, veges, lean meats, etc and exercise - the basic advice of nutritionists for decades. Well, I've been doing that for decades and I've noticed problems with my digestion, energy levels, etc, and to my knowledge they are not disease related, so this one-size fits all advice is just not sufficient for me. I know through my own experience and discussions with other people that people have different constitutions and respond uniquely to different foods.I think the book potentially has a lot to offer and I'm going to give the diet for my blood type a try."
4,Eat Right,"The book contains a great deal of information that does help in eating healthy for your blood type. Although I think when dealing with a husband and wife who are different blood types, the challenges to putting this into practice is quite difficult. Good book, though, well written, thorough food group listings and menu options."
4,Eat right 4 your type,I like this book. My naturopath recommended eating for my blood type. Got a good deal on a used book.
5,Flexible diets that have great Healing Powers!,I read this book with the intention of clearing up a bad acid reflux problem. Not only did I clear that up but lost much unwanted weight in the meantime.The fact that one diet does not suit everyone appeals to me and I have found the effects profound.Everyone should try it for at least 6 weeks as results are so noticableEnjoy it!
3,"interesting, but I doubt its valid","I have heard that the author has recanted his views in this book. It was an interesting read, but for the most part I think it's BS. My uncle gave me the book. He lost a lot of weight on the Type A diet plan, so maybe their is some validity. Or perhaps does just eating healthy make you look and feel better?"
5,Good book,This makes perfect sense. I am looking forward to seeing this work for me. I had to thank my friend for turning me on to this book.
5,the information in his book has given me a whole new life.t,"the title of this book drew me to it. The information is given in an easy to read and follow format. I was so eager to get my family on it (we are all O's) that I bought copies forthem. I am fortunately able to grow a lot of my own food, but cannot buy organicbeef or chicken here. The explanation of Highly Beneficial foods beingmedicine; neutral food being just food; and avoid food as being poison needed to be in large, underlined print, as I somehow missed it the first reading."
2,Know Your Blood Type First,"I was so excited to get this book because I needed help with my diet for several physical problems. However, I'm in my fifties and still do not know my blood type. I have never needed a transfusion, never was able to donate blood, and so never was told what my type was. When I requested to find out at my doctor's office, I discovered that I needed a reason to do the lab work just for typing. I didn't have one, except that this book does no good if you don't know your blood type. I couldn't use it since I couldn't afford the very expensive cost to have the type test for no medical reason."
3,Took a long time to receive and seemed much older than expected,This book took a long time to get. When I did get it it seemed very old and a little more worn than expected.
4,Fulfilled its function as a gift.,"With such a brief period of ownership and because of a subjective testing environment, I cannot attest to the quality of the materials within the book. What I can do, however, is assign the item value as a gift. I purchased it for my sister as a birthday gift. She is an evolutionist and a health enthusiast, so it seemed like the perfect fit.Upon receiving the gift, she was enthralled by its premise. Her best friend and mother-in-law both have read it and validated it by singing its praises. The satisfaction of giving this to someone who I know will appreciate it is more than enough to make it valuable. Even if she doesn't end up reading it, as a gift it has fulfilled half of its function: the satisfaction of the gift-giver."
5,Thank you!,Thank you for this wonderful book. I appreciate the speedy delivery and the great quality of the book. I will enjoy it!
4,A book to help you maintain good eating habits for your blood type,"I have had this book since 2000 and recently purchased it again for my granddaughter who just received her BS degree in Nursing. She is very eager to learn about eating right for your blood type, which is a subject not taught in her educational training."
3,Makes you think,"I'm not going to go into the details of what you should and shouldn't eat because I haven't tried it, but the part mentioned on the personality area I found most fascinating. Japanese culture has had this belief for years. I'm type A and always wondered why some people are pushy and overbearing and others are more live and let live. Me and my mom are both just alike and both type A's and always want to get along with people and live in peace, rather than rule and take charge, whereas my dad and brother are both type O's, extroverted, sarcastic, and could care less of what others think. My supervisor is type B and I knew it without him telling me and only some 10% are type B's. Yes, I know of some type A's that are pushy or outgoing, but I look carefully and find they're putting strain on themselves to be that way."
2,Expected a little differant means of information.,I was a little dissapointed with it and therefore have not read too much of it. Will do so and hope i will get more out of it
3,Printed 1992 last printing 1999,Thers are not new books. They have not even been reprinted in 2012. What givesI should have returned the book. I can get older books in the library or buy them used.??
4,Book orde,"Fast delivery and fair price. However, either the owner is a heavy smoker or the book had been in a smoke-filled room for an extended period of time. When I opened the package there was a heavy odor of smoke. The book has since been aired out and the smell is gone."
3,"Easy reading, but not entirely scientific","The book is outlined well and I have followed some of the tips and tricks for my blood type. However, what I have found to work the best for me since I have numerous food sensitivities is to rely on my actual blood work from labs for food sensitivities and follow those guidelines. Since no two people have the same chemical composition, I just use the book as a guideline but follow my lab work and that really seemed to work the best for me. Good luck and good health to you!"
3,Living Healthier Now,"The concept is solid. I've changed my diet as a result and am feeling great. Also, it provided insight into unique personality traits and inclinations related to blood type, which I thought was interesting and pretty ""on target."""
1,Not quite the book I was expecting,"The book was more repetitive, less scientific and not as substantive as I expected. By the time I got to the core of the book I realized that it was not giving me any new information and actually the recommendations are at complete odds with my food allergies (not food intolerances)."
4,eat right for your type,"this book is a what to and how to insight into food choices for optimal health. an easy to read and easy to understand guide for the person looking to find their strengths and weaknesses and how food impacts his/her particular blood type. finding out these things has forced me to reconsider all the things i ever thought about how to have and maintain a healthy dietary measure. i used to eat wheat and dairy just about every day, thinking it was good for me,though my body gave me obvious signs that it was quite the opposite. i continued trying to force myself into the standard pyramid food chart. this book validated my thoughts about some things that (in the past) traditional dietary molds washed over. lumping everyone in to one catogory. i reccommend this book for anyone looking to find out how to care for their particular blueprint/bloodprint."
5,I am A,I purchased this book for myself 10 years ago.This book shows the history of blood types and whyRead for yourself. Forget diet claims.Lose or gain weight with foods you are suppose to eatbased on your blood type.
1,This book does not relate at all to my blood type!!,"I am a type O+. This is a fact. As such, this book recommends that I eat red meat, and plenty of it. Yet I hate red meat, have never eaten it (since infancy!), and find that many of his recommendations for Type O's are not the least bit appetizing or appealing. I do, however, enjoy all the foods recommended for Type A's, and have eaten that way for 30 years- vegetables, lentils, fruits, and grains. I believe that your body will tell you what it needs- do you crave milk? You need Calcium. Are you shaking and weak? You need protein and less sugar! Listen to your BODY, not this doctor trying to make a buck, exercise regularly and sleep enough each night, and and you will be as healthy as ever."
3,I'm actually detoxing...,"It's been about 10 days since I first started following the guidelines in this book. I'm blood type A, which demands a vegetarian lifestyle. It was and still is very difficult, as I always lived my life as a meat-eater. Anyway, I did not make gradual changes; I plunged right in and omitted all the ""avoid"" food list. About 3 days later, I started to experience a number of discomforts ranging from headaches, mild fever, symptoms of sinus infection and colds, snuffy nose, sleepiness (a couple hours after waking up from a 10-hour sleep!), etc., which made me question the foods I was eating. And then my sister said that I may just be detoxing. And I think she was right. I read up on the topic and found that I am in fact experiencing symptoms of food detoxing. I have yet to lose weight, but I'm sticking to this and will see what happens."
2,questionable claims should be a red flag to readers,"This book is well written as a quick read. However, I disagree (and believe archaeleogical studies will back me up) that primitive man (type O) was primarily a meat eater. Humans were gatherers before they were hunters and hunting only supplemented the gatherers, and eventual farmers. Therefore, the diet emphasis of high protein for type O's just doesn't hold water. Because of this discrepancy I question everything else in the book."
1,ABO Blood groups have NOTHING to do with diet!,"Despite the popularity of this book, it's core premises are wrong. Blood types evolved as a result of exposure to different types of infectious disease pathogens in different parts of the world. The authors can cite all the supposed research they want - at the end of the day, you're wasting your money on a diet plan that is based on zilch."
5,This book changed my life!,"After years of increasing problems with allergies, brain fog, and depression, this book provided me with a way to take control of my health through changing my diet. It is easy and interesting to read, a fun combination of scientific research, the author's personal experience as a naturopathic physician, and fascinating hypotheses about why this works. I have recommended it to all of my friends and even own a second copy which I loan to people all the time. Read it, try the diet for a month and become a believer!"
2,How can this eating plan work if you can't eat the food???,"I first came across this book while surfing the net and the author's ideas and premises sounded interesting and something I wanted to try. Before I took a blood test, I was SURE I was type 'O' (due to my natural cravings, what I like to eat and different eating programs that had worked in the past) - Boy, was I surprised to find I was type 'A' That means VERY little protein and very high carbs - oh, but not just ANY carbohydrates - only NON-WHEAT based ones. Try and eat like THAT for any amount of time!!! I did, and didn't like my choices at all. I quickly decided that while this diet / eating plan might have some merit, it wouldn't work at all if I couldn't stand the food. So I gave it up for something more moderate."
5,"Excellent easy to follow plan, opened eyes/dropped pounds.","My mother got me started on this after she went through Menopause energy problems, she started this, gained energy and lost weight. So I decided to change my life. I'm type O, read the book, found replacements for Wheat/Gluten at Natural Food stores, made my first bread using Brown Rice flour (which tasted GREAT) and have dropped 45+ lbs. I needed a plan to follow, this changed my life. Thank you so much for this book, I am energized and feel and look better than I have in years. I've turned into a carnivore label reading junkie. Just ordered the Cook Book, looking forward to more recepies."
5,This book is an easy to read way to change your life!,"I think anyone who picks up this book will not be able to put it down. It is easy and interesting. The lay out is easy to follow and everything makes sense. It will make anyone reading this book, at least want to give the program a try."
1,What Crap!,"Even those with but a modicum of common sense will realize that the ideas in this book defy the most basic logic. As a blood type A I do not possess the characteristics which the author attributes to all persons of blood type A. I therefore need to make no further effort to dismiss the conclusions that are presented. As proof of his ridiculous suppositions, the author offers the evidence that Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Carter as well as Adolf Hitler were of blood type A and all possessed similar flaws. To suggest that if they had been vegetarians and followed his diet would have solved their problems is too far fetched for this reader."
3,took awhile,"The book arrived on the last day of the time frame given so it took much longer than from other stores I have ordered from. I honestly don't remember what kind of condition I ordered, but I always choose ""like new"" or ""almost like new"" so assuming I did the same thing this time; it wasn't even close. There was a lot of writing in the book and it was pretty well used. However, like I said, I can't swear to what condition I ordered so maybe that was my fault."
3,Diets Are Restrictive,"This is an interesting book, but before spending your money on it, you should know that these recommended diets are more restrictive than most.For example, Blood Type A should not eat beef and to receive the greatest benefits, Type As should eliminate all meats from their diet. They should also avoid shrimp and other types of shellfish, and avoid anything made with whole milk or whole wheat. Dr. D also has it in for certain other foods, since All blood types should avoid bacon/ham/pork and other processed meats, and tomatoes. Other blood types have other specific restrictions.If you are willing to give up these and many other foods, go for it. I know a couple of people who feel better going on these diets, and have lost weight on them. Personally, I am not willing to give up steak, ribs, jerky, bacon or tomatoes."
3,Eat Right 4 Your Type,Book is just what I expected. I am not certain this is sound science but some things make sense and are worth trying. I will use it in conjunction with The Abs Diet. Some of the recipes are excellent. This seller was quite good and shipment was prompt. I am well pleased.
1,The Wrong Type,"I admit that I did not read the entire book because after I read the introduction I was aghast at the supposition that blood types determine such clear cut differences in metabolism and physiology. Although blood types certainly do affect our physiology, so do hundreds of other genetic and expressed differences. It is akin to suggesting different diets for men and women, short and tall people, or those of different ethnic backgrounds. I just don't buy the scientific premise of this book."
1,Complete and utter bunk... from a naturopath quack!,"This is the most ridiculous diet theory I've ever heard of. Maybe I'll write a new diet book called ""Eating Right for Your Astrological Sign"" and rake in the bucks. Which blood type should be eating the candy bars, cookies, donuts, chips, soda pop, refined carbohydrates, Big Macs and french fries... did I miss something? He doesn't recommend them for any of the four groups... so GEE WIZ! Maybe just eliminating all the Junk Food from our diets would work just as well as this Junk Science Diet."
1,Another scam diet based on junk science,"Please research this diet book before you take it seriously. It seems this guy just makes stuff up as he goes along. Basing a diet on blood type is just ridiculous and it may help you lose weight in the short term but by limiting the fruits, grains, and veggies(in the O type diet) you are sure to do harm to your health in the long run. Hasn't the low carb diet already been proven a farce or do people still believe in that nonsense?"
1,This book is a joke,"According to Eat Right 4 Your Type, I should eat a vegetarian diet based on whole grains because I am blood type A. I tried this for a little while and got so sick - turned out I had a gluten intolerance. If this book works for you it can probably be attributed to luck more than anything else. I suggest Food and Western Disease: Health and nutrition from an evolutionary perspective by Staffan Lindeberg. It's real science and worth every penny."
2,Blood types and personality,"So according to ""The Personality Question"" sections of this book, real men are type O's, normal ""in-betweeners"" are type B's, and type A's are wusses, since type O's are meat eaters, B'scan eat anything but chicken, and type A's vegetarians (dear me)Enough said."
1,eat for your blood type,"I dod not like the information learned in this book, or it's application.Disappointed, for sure."
2,"Eat Right for You Type: The Individualized Diet, etc.","Dr. D'Amato's opinions and research is not backed up with proper medical research and statistics.I don't know where he got some of his material! For example: ""O"" refers to the Rhesus antigen - not ""old,"" as he states! Most high school and/or freshman college student know better!Where did he graduate from college and medical school?"
1,Eat Right 4 Your Type,I totally disagree with his premis as I don't believe in evolution. There are a few interesting points that I will incorporate into my life style but can't support the theory as a whole. Pretty bogus.
3,"A very good book, all told","This is a very good book. It is truly amazing to know that your blood type significantly determines the types of food you can and should eat.I would have given this book 5 stars, but I noticed some conflicting information in the list of foods per blood type and the associated menus. More focus should have been paid to these sections to eliminate the occasional conflicts."
5,It Works!,"Here's some more anecdotal evidence in support of Dr. D'Adamo's ideas:I was a vegetarian for 5 1/2 years, basically living on granola and non-fat yogurt, so I was amazed to find that at age 22, although I wasn't at all overweight, I had borderline-high cholesterol. If you've read this book, you can guess the rest--I'm type O, and that ""healthy"" diet was based on exactly the wrong food for me. My doctor at the time suggested severely limiting my intake of dairy products, and voila--my cholesterol dropped 80 points in a year, to 130.Another example: a close family friend of mine, aged 50, suffered a near-heart attack and the outlook was grim. He switched to the right diet for his type, and HIS CHOLESTEROL DROPPED 60 POINTS IN ONE MONTH!!!!!! He's now in a low-risk group for cardiac disease. His doctors are amazed. Maybe they should read this book."
2,Not Worth It,"I bought the book shortly after a friend of mine recommended it. I know a lot about nutrition and found many faults in the diet. I believe it can help you lose weight at first, but it is not a long-term solution. I went ahead and tried it, and about a week later I suddenly went from very energetic to sluggish. I was also feeling sick. When I went to visit my friend, who happens to be a nautropathic doctor, he figured out that I was actually starving myself. I followed the book down to the last detail, but because I was denying myself so many types of food, my body took offense. I cannot recommend this diet. Of course, I do agree that nothing can work for everybody, and I could just be a rare case. My advice, do what works for you, but I would never go back."
5,Eat Right 4 Your Blood Type,"Following the blood type guidelines in this book is one of the best things we have ever done for our overall health & weight control. Truly life & health changing. It also helps you understand why certain diets (low-carb, low-fat, etc.)work better for some people and not for others. After only 1 month on my blood type plan a severe neck problem I had had for 12 months disappeared completely...after the chiropractor told me it would never completely heal. The only change I made was to follow this book. Also by following the supplement guidelines I have almost completely eliminated the problem I had with cold sores. There are 2 key reasons it helps for weight control: (1) Certain foods either slow down or rev up your metabolism. (2) Eating the highly beneficial foods satisfies your hunger much more completely than foods you should avoid. You will never regret the money you spend on this book"
4,A New Spin on Nutrition,"This book is an interesting alternative to The Zone, which I did not find helpful at all, probably because I have Type A blood.D'Adamo explains his concepts in sufficiently technical language to make his arguments appear credible.The only problem I have with this book is that a lot of the food suggested is quite unusual. Perhaps the author should suggest where people can purchase these kinds of foods."
5,Highly Recommended Reading,"Dr. D'Adamo's book explores the connection between a person's dietary needs and that person's blood type. Basically, the idea is that we are all individuals, with different dietary needs. In order to remain healthy, we must consume foods that are beneficial for our blood type. And, since not everyone has the same blood type, there is no single diet plan that will work for everybody.Dr. D'Adamo's work may not completely revolutionize our diet, but, at the least, he does bring up the idea that our genes should determine what our diet should be. I recommend this book to anyone who is planning to go on a diet. The ideas presented, and additionally the suggested diet for each blood type, might give us some additional weapons in our arsenal in the fight to stay lean and healthy."
5,Great book! Great price!,I'd misplaced my previous copy...or loaned it out and never got it returned. :-) Thank you for providing it at a good price and delivering it in a timely manner in good shape. It is very insightful and practically helpful.
2,Really should not have bothered.,This book was just another diet book and I would never follow it. Really just a waste of my money.
2,BOLOGNA,"Again, a lot of hyperbola for simply reducing consumption. As a retired FDA Investivator, I have to call RUBBISH on this one. Whatever, my Sister swears by it."
3,Interersting Addition to the Diet Literature.,"This is yet another 'diet' book. WHen you read the different ones, they all make sense within their own systems. This is no different. I have to say it doesn't resonate with me so well so I won't be following the diet, but it's well thought through, well documented and interesting to read. If nothing else, it will push you against your beliefs and challenge you to think about the issues."
5,Outstanding survey of the topic!,"In a relatively short volume, the author gives a lucid, restrained survey of a complicated and controversial topic. Coverage is of all phases of the war affecting Germany--military, social, economic, and political--though relatively short shrift is given to military matters, so this book is not for World War I military ""enthusiasts""--unless they want to go beyond what occurred in combat. A particularly good feature of the book is the wealth of references to the vast amount of scholarly work done on the war in English and German over the last half century. The author's comprehensive ""Suggestions for Further Reading"" will serve well either the novice historian or the layperson interested in particular aspects of Germany and the Great War."
5,fun and unique clay illustrations!!,"I've been reading this book since I was young and still immensely enjoy it, mostly because of the illustations. Edith Chase uses a different kind of medium for the pictures...clay! The blended colors and textures are eye-catching and witty...very appropiate for children of all ages.The text is actually a rhyme written by a different author before the whole book came together. I'm pretty sure Edith Chase rewrote it, though. The rhythm of the words make them fun play for your voice.The story itself is about a cute calf and his loving mother living on a farm. The calf nurses, eats, runs, plays, and grows...children can definitely relate to this book."
2,Lots of time for little insight,"I'm seriously wanting to change careers so I bought this book on the strength of the reviews. I also previously flipped through other career books at the bookstore. I realized after completing this book, that these books generally don't provide insightful career guidance that are really tailored to a person's interests/personality/etc.First are a series of skills tests(e.g., numerical, clerical, spatial, verbal), like an SAT, except they're timed. Then there's a sort of personality test, followed by a motivation test. At the end of each test, the book provides a sample of careers which matches to your results. I noticed a lack of computer-oriented careers in this book which probably reflects it's publication date. Well, the list of careers generated for me was not appealing at ALL.My overall experience with these books (and researching professional career assessments) has taught me that there are no easy answers in the search for a perfect career."
4,"""Wheels on the bus,"" in Spanish!","The songs have a nice tone and fun beats. Our 2 year old son (with english speaking parents) imitates the words on the songs as we drive down the highway. He REALLY gets a kick out of it when he recognizes the Spanish version of a familiar song. My wife and I love to sing along too; it's a fun way to learn Spanish. It's a bit of a rip off that the words are sold separately, however."
5,Best of the series by far!,"This is a fantastic CD for introducing/teaching your child Spanish in a fun way...with songs! Delightful and authentic, keeps ours entertained and amused. Asked for again and again!! Get this one."
2,I suppose I'm an idiot,"I've tried several times to read and enjoy this piece of fantasy freshman English types have been forced to drudge through for the last century. I've never succeeded. I tried it as a young man, forced to write papers on it and hated it. I've tried it as a horrid old codger, discovering tome by tome that books I once found awful have now grown merit and become a source of joy. Not so with this one.Likely as not Erewhon was imaginative when it was written. Today it's been superceded by thousands of better reads with the same theme. There's nothing here that won't be found more interestingly expressed on any library or bookstore shelf in America."
3,Alfie Kohn makes some valid points,I definitely want to watch this video again. I had to stop & start several times to get through the video. It's gets busy with kids. But I do feel that Alfie Kohn has some valid points to make towards the end. Throughout the majority of the video I felt like he gave a lot of examples of how NOT to discipline your child. I kept waiting for the DO's and had enough of the DON'TS. I do like some of the real life scenarios the adds to his lectures.
5,excellent product,well described.it's an excellent product and suites my soldering needs. produces clean and shiny solder joints as expected.i would buy another one if i run out of it.
4,Would probably buy with No-Clean Flux next time,"I use a variable temperature soldering station(under the Xytronic brand) which I set to 550* F. The Kester 44 63/37 solder melts quickly at this temperature. It leaves nice shiny and strong solder joints. If re-work(desoldering) is needed it again melts quickly. The solder wire diameter/size/gauge at .031 inches works well for both SMD components and soldering different sized wire to switches, potentiometers, etc. It also works well with the cheaper variable wattage Stahl Tools(Parts Express) soldering station.There is only 1 complaint - there seems to be too much flux/rosin in this solder. After soldering for a few minutes my iron-chrome plated tip starts turning brown from flux/rosin residue. I have to turn up the temperature to clean it off on a sponge(I prefer not to use the brass wire tip cleaner on a hot tip). Because of this in the future I would buy the No Clean flux solder."
4,About what you expect,"For the price and for the quantity of pliers you get about the quality you would expect. Not more, not less."
4,An all-time soulman with the silky voice,"Ronnie Dyson has a superb voice and the rich orchestrations on this album combine to make for a heart-rending listening experience. Dyson has one of those vocal ranges where he can slide up to the highest high, or sing in a whisper that conveys oh so much emotion. And with so many tracks, this album just has to be excellent value. If you've never heard Ronnie Dyson, just listen to 'When you get right down to it' to experience a ballad that has it all - big band orchestra, Dyson's wonderful voice and that light, shade and big finale that makes for a song that really grabs you."
1,Doesn't work on most Macs,This game requires a high memory video card not found on most Mac computers.Be careful when buying any version of this game. Don't purchase without verifying the required video card.
1,"Poor documentation- Tiger Wood PGA Tour 2003, and Tour 2012 (Mac)","After reading bad reviews on the TW golf series (for Mac), I found I could get the Tour 2003 and Tour 2012 for 5 bucks each, so I did it.The bad reviews were right! - The 2003 had no useful help, but I found a document that shows the keystroke symbols for a variety of actions, but they don't explain what keys the symbols represent! I assume this doc refers to the 2003 and 2012 games.The programs obviously have many neat options. I'll have to work to figure them out. Any help would be appreciated."
5,Fantastic!,"Just started playing the demo version of this game. It is the best golf game I have played on the Mac or any other platform. The graphics are fantastic, and I can't stop playing. Can't wait to have the full version."
4,Challenging and Fun,"My son is ten and he says it's challenging. It make you think and has a lot of different challenges. It has several levels. Therefore it does not get boring. It's very similar to the movie but has a lot things that does not have nothing to do with the movie. The game focus on the main idea of the movie. Compared to other games he's played it's longer and challenging. As a parent, I would recommend this to age 7-14."
4,sinking the ground anchors,"I dug a starter hole with post hole diggers and filled them with water. Next day, I used a T-wrench (used for cutting off water at meter) to screw the anchors into the ground. It helps if you have someone keep the anchor vertical because you will need to exert downward pressure as you turn, The end of the T wrench fits perfectly over the eye of the anchor."
2,Prokosch's last try at Amnerican success,"Prokosch's last attempt to repeat his early successes and, in the process, win an American market.Again, read Robert Greenfield's biography, ""Dreamer's Journey."""
4,Good Stuff,"Great design and works really well. I wish it had come with some double sided tape to attach it to the floor, but easy to do myself."
